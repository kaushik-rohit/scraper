WATER CHURNS Three days to go until the election - and a row over claims that David Cameron admitted privately that he cannot win a majority. The claim is seized upon as the main party leaders enter the final stage of the campaign. I have never met a senior Conservative who has told me privately they think they are actually going to win this election outright. Nick Clegg is increasingly desperate because he knows the truth, which is there is an inescapable choice. David Cameron seems to have now said he is not going to win the election. I think that says it all. We’ll be getting the latest from our correspondents on the election trail.

Gun salutes for the new Royal Princess in an hour’s time, as the nation waits for a name. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. A row has broken out about claims that David Cameron privately told the Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg- in a conversation before the election campaign - that he didn’t believe the Conservatives would win a majority. The Conservatives have angrily described the story as ""100% wrong"". With just three days to go until polls open, the main political parties are returning to their key election themes. The Conservatives are promising tax cuts for 30 million people, while Labour will warn of what it calls ""secret"" Tory plans to privatise the NHS. Our correspondent Ben Geoghegan reports. We have been watching them closely for weeks, We have been watching them closely forweeks, now for weeks, now there are just three days left to decide which of these men and women will run the country or, perhaps, help to run it. The leaders of the two biggest parties want everyone to believe they can still get an overall majority. But today, a row broke out over whether or not David Cameron really thinks he can win the election outright. It follows claims by this man, Paul Scriven. He is a Liberal Democrat peer and this morning, he posted a tweet claiming David Cameron privately told Nick Clegg that the Tories would not win an overall majority. You are saying Nick Clegg said to you that Mr Cameron privately said to him, we are clearly not going to win a majority. I do not take clearly not going to win a majority. Ido not take anything back I said in the tweet. He said that towards the end of the parliament, before it closed. Nick Clegg was out campaigning in Twickenham this morning. The idea that David Cameron might speedily be unsure of a majority is helpful to the Lib Dems, who have been promoting themselves as future coalition partners. He claims there is a big difference between what the Tories say in public and in private. I had never met a senior Conservative who has told me privately that they think they are going to win the election all right. And what they say privately is correct, they are not going to win the election outright and they are communicating a big fib that they are going to win the majority of 23 seats. But the Conservatives insist the majority is still within their grasp. Today, the Prime Minister was trying to keep the focus on the economy. Fixing the roof when the Sun is shining. They have angrily denied the claims by the Liberal Democrats. I think Nick Clegg is increasingly desperate, because he knows the truth that there is an inescapable choice, people have to choose whether they want me to continue as Prime Minister or Ed Miliband and SNP, the only other available option. Ed Miliband tried to exploit the row today, even though Labour may not win an overall majority. Other leaders, I gather, are conceding the outcome of this election. David Cameron has said they are not going to win the election. I think that says it all. I think that says it all about him and about his campaign. One party leaderwho has been playing down her chances ever so slightly is Nicola Sturgeon. She was asked that the Scottish Nationalistss would enjoy a clean sweep in Scotland on Thursday? Well, in practical terms, but party or parties that can command a majority get to form a Government and I have made it clear that if there are more anti-Tory MPs in the House of Commons on Friday than there are Tory MPs, I would want to work together to keep David Cameron out of office. There are still millions of undecided voters, so the main parties will be trying hard this week to keep the focus on their core messages. Today has demonstrated just how hard that can be. Ina moment, In a moment, we will speak to our correspondence with the Liberal Democrats and Labour, but first, Carole Walker is with the Conservatives. What are they saying behind the scenes which what is the mood about this row? I think there is a certain amount of irritation in these final few days before polling day. David Cameron has been wanting to focus on his message about the economy, the promise of tax cuts, which he says would benefit some 30 million people over the next Parliament. Instead, there is this distraction, as they see it, a row over this that David Cameron had admitted that he was not going to be able to form an outright majority Government. What they say is that this is totally untrue, they are categorically denying that David Cameron ever admitted he he was not going to win an outright majority, but he might need the support of Nick Clegg in another coalition. They say they are still fighting overall to get that majority that they need. They say they need an extra 23 seats. I think one of the reasons why there is so much annoyance is that he is out campaigning today come here on the south coast, across the south-west, and many of those marginal seats are seeds that the Conservatives want to take from the Liberal Democrats. -- seats. They say they will focus on those core messages, as David Cameron mensa pretty frenetic campaign over these final few days to try and win another term in Downing Street. And in Surrey, Sophie Long is with the Liberal Democrat campaign. A private conversation has become very, very public. Yes, that is right, Nick Clegg, you can see behind me, he hasjust arrived in Carshalton. At every stop today, he has said it is a private conversation and he cannot talk about private conversations. What he has said is he has not had any private conversations with any senior Conservatives who have claimed they can get a majority on Thursday. It is interesting, perhaps, that this private conversation that allegedly took place more than a month ago has suddenly been made very public by one of Nick Clegg’s very close friends. It does not do him any harm, shall we say, because it rather focuses minds on this, the key message of Nick Clegg’s election campaign overthe key message of Nick Clegg’s election campaign over the last five weeks also, that whoever walks through the doors of Downing Street after next week will not do so alone, and he will be hoping that as mines focus on that and people become more anxious about a potential lurch to the right for the left, they will seek the reassurance of the Liberal Democrats, which he says will hold the centre ground and keep any coalition Government, as the guarantors of stability. That is his message today and the fact that this private conversation that may or may not have taken place is now very public has not done him any harm at all. Sophie Long in Carshalton. Peter Hunt is with the Labour campaign in Brighton. On the face of this, it would look like something of an open goal. It is a complete free hit for Ed Miliband, this reported conversation. He says it tells us all we need to know about David Cameron and his campaign. By contrast, Ed Miliband says he is fighting every step of the way over the next 72 hours and he does not want to concentrate and talk about, as he has had to, the Tory allegation that a potential Labour minority Government would be propped UP minority Government would be propped up by the SNP, he said he could not be clearer, they are not talking to the SNP but he wants to talk about the NHS, casting our minds back to 1997 on the eve of that election, Tony Blair talking about having 24 hours to save the NHS. Now in 2015, he is talking about the NHS being in grave danger and fighting for its life and needing to be saved. He says if there was another Tory Government, it would suffer from creeping privatisation, cuts and a reorganisation that the Tories have not been honest about and, under questioning, he insisted he was not overstating the threat. Peter Hunt, Sophie Long and Carole Walker, thank you all very much. There’ve been scuffles on the streets of Glasgow this morning involving Labour Party supporters and their opponents. The Labour leader in Scotland, jim Murphy, was trying to address party activists in the city centre when he was drowned out by protestors playing loud music and shouting ""Red Tories out"". Police in Dallas say have shot dead two men outside a building that was hosting a competition to draw cartoons of the Muslim Prophet Mohammed. They say the men fired shots at a security guard. Our correspondent Alastair Leithead sent this report. It all happened in just a few seconds. The two men opened fire outside the community centre, injuring a security guard, but the police immediately killed them both. It’s not yet known who the men were or why they drove up to the entrance of the centre’s car park and started shooting. Inside the centre, the police Swat teams helped evacuate around 70 people from the building. Witnesses say 20 shots were heard. We started hearing, it sounded like a machine gun, maybe. Kind of quick shots. Police started running everywhere. They had been competing to draw the best cartoon of the Prophet Muhammad, something hugely insulting to many Muslims. Security was tight for the controversial and some would say provocative expression of their freedom of speech. There were some small protests before, but police said there was no credible threat of any attack. The New York-based American Freedom Defense Initiative is considered a hate group by a US organisation which monitors extremism. The Dutch anti-Islamic politician, Geert Wilders, was the main speaker at the event. He’s said to be on Al-Oaeda’s hit list for his views. We will never allow Islam to rob us of our freedom of speech. Never. For hours, the bodies of the two men lay where they’d fallen, as bomb disposal robots were sent in to see if there were any explosives in the car, purely as a precaution. Once they take care of the bodies, they will be able to start to piece together who these two men were and why they opened fire. Alastair Leithead, Los Angeles. American troops and emergency aircraft have arrived in Nepal to American troops and emergency aircraft have arrived in Nepal to help deliver aid to remote areas hit by the earthquake. About 100 US Marines are now in Kathmandu. Nepal’s only international airport has banned larger aid aircraft from landing because of concerns about the runway. In some parts of the region delivering fresh water is the priority. Our correspondent, Yogita Limaye, sent this report. There’s a long queue of people waiting here in this playground area of Kathmandu. Most of these people have been camping in this ground after the earthquake on Saturday. The ministry’s been distributing water and a little food here. They try and do it about two times a day and that’s what these people are waiting in line for. TRANSLATION: I lived in a rented home in Kathmandu. It’s been completely destroyed. I don’t know where I should go. I’m also very scared. We are getting some aid from the Government here. In many ways, the people here are better off. We know that the Government has only been able to reach some remote villages a couple of days ago and many people there are still waiting to be rescued. And then there’s of course the big challenge of distributing relief supplies that are coming in here to Kathmandu to those far-flung areas and it has taken a very long time to reach there. There’s a shortage of helicopters. Sometimes the weather is not good. It is a challenge for the Nepalese Government, but patience is now running out and anger is building up in those areas. Nearly 7,000 migrants have been rescued in the Mediterranean over the weekend, after the biggest operation of its kind by Italian coastguards this year. Many were picked up from small wooden boats off the Libyan coast. Ten bodies have also been recovered. The number of attempted crossings is surging as smugglers try to take advantage of calmer seas. Our correspondent Gordon Corera reports. Nearly 900 migrants arriving on a ship in Sicily earlier this morning after being rescued at sea. A sign that the flow of those making the dangerous crossing to Europe shows no sign of easing. Infact, this past weekend observers say maybe as busy as any there’s been. Of course, it’s a struggle. It is a daily struggle. And particularly when so many people arrive in one day or two days, we are speaking about almost 7,000 people in a weekend. So, the system is, of course, under pressure. The weekend saw at least 17 separate operations by Italian and French ships, the largest by Italian coastguards off the Libyan coast. An expectant mother, already in labour, was among those rescued. Her baby was born on board an Italian patrol vessel. Both mother and daughter are said to be in good health. Many others required medical attention and at least ten bodies were recovered over the weekend. Those embarking on the journey say they know the risks, but are still willing to take them. And in Libya, at a willing to take them. And in Libya, ata camp at a camp for those who have been turned back, there’s frustration. Me and my family we are suffering too much. We are very poor. You understand - much. We are very poor. You understand - no food to eat? Nothing to eat. So, it’s not a crime for me to risk my live for my family. We are risking our lives. Not happy like this. We are suffering. Can’t you see, we are suffering? At least l. you see, we are suffering? At least 1, 750 people have died you see, we are suffering? At least 1,750 people have died this year trying to cross the Mediterranean. A 20-fold increase on the same period last year. Many more migrants are expected to make the crossing in the coming weeks, as smugglers take advantage of calmer weather. Now in the next hour, at 2:00pm, gun salutes will take place in London to mark the birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s baby girl. Volleys will be fired by soldiers in Hyde Park and at the Tower of London to honour the arrival of the new princess. Let’s speak to our correspondent Daniela Relph who’s at Kensington Palace. What can we expect today? Of course, we are all waiting for a name. We are all waiting for that name. We are hopeful we’ll get that name today. I am afraid there’s no guarantee it will be happening. What we are waiting for at the moment is to see if the Duke and Duchess and Prince George leave their London home for Norfolk. They will move effectively up to Norfolk, to their new home there, where the Duke of Cambridge will be based as an air ambulance pilot. The crucial thing about them going to Norfolk, should they do so today is the Queen is there. There’s no protocol which says that I have to tell the Queen the name of the baby first. I think especially if Elizabeth is a name they have chosen, it would be a nice touch if the Queen was introduced to her new great granddaughter and heard the name before anyone else was told about it. We are waiting to see if the family leave here. In terms of the names - see if the family leave here. In terms of the names - the favourite have remained the same - terms of the names - the favourite have remained the same - Alice and Charlotte. Of course Elizabeth in there, Diana. And Grace and Rose. At the moment, we don’t know for certain. We are waiting to see if the family leave here, Kensington Palace, at some point this afternoon. Thank you very much. The Arctic Ocean is entering what’s being described as ""a new era"" as temperatures rise and the sea ice there becomes thinner. That’s the view of scientists taking part in a Norwegian expedition. Since the start of the year, their ship has been drifting in the ice pack so they can investigate how the region is changing. Our science editor David Shukman has sent this report. I’m in the Arctic, standing on the frozen ocean. Below me there is about a metre and a half of ice and then below that, just the dark sea. The temperature here is about -21, and it’s a windy day, so you really have got to wear everything you possibly can to survive out here. Now, I’m visiting this research vessel. It’s run by the Norwegian Polar Institute. It is called the Lancer. It acts as a kind of mothership for science. A set of floating laboratories. But a lot of the science here takes place on the ice. Teams of researchers fanning out across this white wilderness, to gather data on everything from the state of the ice, the snow, the ocean below, and the atmosphere above. It is all part of building up a picture of how this region is changing. There are real dangers with doing this research, one of them is polar bears. We saw one of these great animals as we flew here by helicopter. So any time anyone is out on the ice away from the ship, someone has to carry a flare gun and a rifle and keep watch for those polar bears. Another threat is that this ice is rather mobile - it looks rock solid but it is shifting all the time, so people have to keep a close look out to check that the surface beneath their feet is notjust crumbling. And although scientists have instruments scattered across the ice, often in these little huts and tents behind me, they have to be ready at a moment’s notice to rush back on board to stay safe. This has happened several times since the expedition began in january. Since it runs until the summer, that’s bound to happen again. Our top story this lunch time: The Conservatives dismiss as nonsense claims that David Cameron admitted to Nick Clegg that he would not get an overall majority in the general election. That’s all from us. Now on BBC One it’s time for the news where you Now on BBC One it’s time for the news where you are. Have a good afternoon. Welcome to BBC London news.

I like the Diana part, that seems appropriate somehow. We’ll be live at Kensington Palace. Also tonight: The three main Westminster leaders on a final round of rallying of hand-shaking and persuading, with three days to the election. Scuffles in Glasgow as opponents try to scupper some last minute campaigning from Labour. In the US, two gunmen who opened fire outside a conference on cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad are shot dead by police. And deep within the Arctic Circle, as scientists look at the impact of global warming. Good evening. The new royal baby has a name - Charlotte Elizabeth Diana. The daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will be known as Her Royal Highness Princess Charlotte of Cambridge. The little princess was born on Saturday in St Mary’s Hospital in London. There had been speculation that her name would include that of Diana, in honour of Prince William’s mother. Let’s go now to our Royal Correspondent Nicholas Witchell, who’s outside Kensington Palace for us. Yes, a set of names with strong family connections on both sides of the family, with the Windsors and the Middleton ‘s. Names Elizabeth and Diana, which represent tradition and sentiment, and in Charlotte name in which due course will give this newest member of the Royal family a chance to establish an identity of her own. Two days old and now with a very grown-up sounding name and title. Her Royal Highness Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, or to give her her full names, Charlotte Elizabeth Diana. A set of names chosen by William and Catherine which strongly embrace their daughter’s royal pedigree but which are also meant to be favourites within the Middleton family. Charlotte, her principal name, is the middle name of Catherine’s younger sister Pippa, it’s also the female variation of her grandfather’s name Charles, so there is a link to both sides of the family. Elizabeth, clearly in tribute to her great grandmother, the Queen, who was visibly delighted by the news on Saturday of the birth of her fifth great-grandchild. And then the third name, the reasons for which really need no explanation. That this newly born princess has Diana as one of her names fulfils William’s deeply held wish that his beloved mother should not be forgotten. First reactions to the names seem to be positive. I like the Diana part. Yes. That seems appropriate somehow. That’s lovely. I love the name Charlotte, I think it is nice and traditional. And the fact they have got Diana in there as well, I think it means a lot to the family. Really happy, really pleased. And in choosing Charlotte, William and Catherine have chosen a name which, while traditional, is also fresh. It hasn’t been used by the Royal family for many generations. I think they have almost certainly chosen Charlotte simply because they like the name, and one of the things we have come to respect about Prince William and Catherine is that they do exactly what they want to do and I think that’s rather nice. The birth of the fourth in line to the throne was marked today by gun salutes at the Tower of London... And in Hyde Park, within earshot of William and Catherine’s London home at Kensington Palace. Tomorrow the Queen will be back at Buckingham Palace, and it’s thought that that may be the opportunity for her to meet her newest great-grandchild, Charlotte Elizabeth Diana. And that first encounter between Charlotte Elizabeth Diana and her great-grandmother, the Queen, is expected to take place tomorrow, either here at Kensington Palace or Buckingham Palace. Then William, Catherine, George and Charlotte will be moving to north led to their new home for the next few weeks before William takes up hisjob as an air ambulance pilot there. -- William takes up hisjob as an air ambulance pilot there. -- in Norfolk. With just three days to go until the election, the parties are making last-ditch efforts to persuade undecided voters to back them. Ed Miliband returned to one of his key campaign messages, that the NHS is better off under Labour. David Cameron concentrated on the economy and his record in Government. There was also a row between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats over claims David Cameron privately told Nick Clegg, before the campaign, that he didn’t think he’d win a majority, something Mr Cameron denies. Our Deputy Political Editorjames Landale reports. The weeks they have been on the road campaigning, and with only 60 hours to go on till polling station open, it is almost nonstop. When opinion polls are this close, every moment and vote counts, as do celebrity endorsements. Today Delia Smith urged voters to cook up a Labour government. But for the Labour leader it is not endorsements but the NHS that he hopes may win over undecided voters. We face a big choice about the future of our NHS. We will be fighting against the Conservative plan for deeper cuts, privatisation and a plan which will undermine the NHS as we know it. I will spend the last 72 hours of this campaign fighting to rescue the NHS from the great danger posed by David Cameron. The man in question spent the day willing swing voters in the south-west of England, promising tax cuts for 30 million people and warning voters that the only choice at this election was between him and the Labour leader. Ed Miliband, I remember, who got hurt in the crash? It wasn’t the bankers, they got away with the pensions and knighthoods they gave -- with the pensions and knighthoods they gave -- you gave them. Who got hurt was the families, so don’t lecture us! Think of what we have done. And so say these Lib Dems. The Prime Minister in their view is not such a good fellow. Today senior figures in the party claimed Mr Cameron had admitted in private to Nick Clegg that the Tories would not get a majority, claimed the Tories categorically denied. For the Deputy Prime Minister, winning here means offering stability in another coalition. I have never met another senior politician who tells me they can win this election outright, and thatis can win this election outright, and that is correct, they won’t and now they are basically communicating a big fat fib that they will win a majority. So the campaign goes on, but minds are already turning to who does a deal with whom if no party wins out right. That is the big debate taking place at Westminster and in party headquarters around London. It is what happens on Friday morning when we all wake up and no one party has an overall majority in the House of Commons. What happens then? All the big attention has been focused on what relationship, if any, Labour might have with the SNP but I have been told senior Labour figures are considering some kind of minority coalition with the Liberal Democrats. This is the scenario, the Conservatives win most votes but don’t get a majority and are unable to get enough support to form a government, so Labour gets a go at forming that government but instead it chooses to form it with the support of the Liberal Democrats. The argument is that it would make that government more legitimate in the eyes of other people, it also makes it easier for the Government to win votes in the House of Commons and the House of Lords. A Labour spokesman dismissed this as mere speculation, and the Lib Dems said whatever happens they will work in the national interest to stop the Tories or Labour veering left or right. Scuffles broke out when protestors disrupted a Labour campaign rally in Glasgow. The Scottish Labour leader, jim Murphy, who was campaigning with comedian Eddie Izzard, has condemned what he called ""aggressive nationalism"". The SNP criticised the violence and said the protest had nothing to do with them. Our Scotland Correspondent james Cook reports. It began as a stroll in the summer sunshine. Scottish Labour way behind in the polls, taking the campaign to the streets. But a small group of protesters had other ideas. These demonstrators have dogged jim Murphy and his supporters since last year’s referendum. jim Murphy has been here now for 20 minutes but we have not been able to hear anything he has said. He has been drowned out by the protesters who have been chanting red Tories out, and at points it has been quite nasty. This was street politics in the raw. justify the Iraq war! justify the Iraq war! They are campaigning on behalf of the Scottish National Party, and this is with them ahead in the polls! It is a remarkable degree of aggression, it is unacceptable. It is very toxic coming from Scottish Nationalists, why can’t theyjust let the democratic process happen? We are putting forward a point of view but shouting over it is not democracy. Are you proud of what you have done here today? I’m proud, we got the message across. These people are walking over us, expenses cheats. This is democracy? Shouting in people’s faces in the streets? Democracy is dead. Nicola Sturgeon doesn’t think so. Way ahead in the polls, the last thing she needs is any bad behaviour. I take a strong that anyone in the election is allowed to campaign without being abused, and this is a fantastic campaign and we should be putting out positive messages and an engaging positively with the people of Scotland. All day, all week, all year the SNP leader has been greeted by cheering crowds. This was Greenock on the Clyde, smiling supporters out in force. Two very different Scotlands on show today. Now some more of the day’s election news. The Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, has been campaigning in Margate, one of the seats the party hopes to win. During the day he warned of the very real danger he believes Islamic extremists pose to the UK. He said people were fearful extremists could enter the UK by crossing the Mediterranean with migrants from North Africa. The Green Party leader, Natalie Bennett, has accused Britain’s main parties of trying to sound tougher on immigration than Ukip. Campaigning in north London, she claimed the Greens would never blame migrants for the failure of Government policies, and called for an open and caring Britain. Comedian Russell Brand, who recently interviewed Ed Miliband, has given his backing to Labour. He’s previously urged people not to vote at all, but changed his stance saying there was a need to end ‘the danger of the Conservative Party’. Two gunmen have been shot dead in the US after opening fire outside a conference on cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. The event in a suburb of Dallas, organised by a group critical of Islam, included a contest for drawings of the Prophet. The authorities are said to be investigating possible links between the gunmen and foreign militants such as the self-styled Islamic State. Aleem Maqbool reports. Get back into the building. It happened so quickly, gunmen firing, and the police firing back and killing the attackers. Inside, officers relate what happened. They might have explosives on them, that is what we are worried about. We started hearing a machine gun, like quick shots. The police were running everywhere and they told us to run and get back in the building. Police had prepared for an attack like this given the nature of the gathering. Those attending were moved to this secure room, and there was an event where prizes were offered for cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. They were there to shoot people and we continue to monitor social media and other detail to make sure we are not getting any more threats. So we don’t know their intent, other than we know that they were willing to pull up and start shooting on the police. One of the gunmen is reported to be Elton Simpson. His home in Arizona has been raided by police. He had previously been investigated for terrorism offences. Four hours, the bodies of both attackers were left where they fell. Police were worried they had explosives on them. Local Muslim groups called for the community to ignore the event and not give it publicity. Instead, the attack here has catapulted into the headlines theissues has catapulted into the headlines the issues surrounding Islam and free speech, even here in America. Hundreds of migrants have arrived in Sicily and on the Italian mainland after being rescued in the Mediterranean at the weekend. In all, nearly 7,000 were picked up. Among them was a woman who gave birth to this baby shortly after being pulled on board an Italian patrol ship. In Nepal, bodies continue to be recovered in more remote areas following the devastating earthquake nine days ago. Around 300 people are believed to have died in the village of Langtang - which is popular with foreign tourists - after it was destroyed by a landslide triggered by the earthquake. The former Tottenham and England strikerjimmy Greaves is in intensive care in hospital after suffering a severe stroke. The 75-year-old was taken ill yesterday. Greaves is the fourth-highest England goalscorer of all time. They’re at the forefront of research into global warming - a group of Norwegian scientists aboard a boat deliberately wedged into the Arctic ice pack. Theirjob is to work out how the polar region is changing because of rising temperatures. Our Science Editor David Shukman was invited aboard the vessel drifting in the ice 300 miles north of the Norwegian island of Svalbard and he sent this report. Science at its most extreme. Out on the frozen Arctic Ocean, Science at its most extreme. Out on the frozen Arctic Ocean, researchers are braving punishing cold to measure the ice below them. In recent years, it has become thinner. The Arctic is changing. We have consistently underestimated the pace of change over recent years, and there are reasons to think that this will continue, and the most important thing with the changing Arctic is that it also affects whether an climate elsewhere. The expedition was launched in the eerie dark of the polar winter in january. The research vessel stationed in the icepack acting as a mothership for the scientist. With conditions like these, very little research has been done at this time of year. The time-lapse camera captures how the ice is in constant motion, ripped apart beside the ship in less than two hours. It is -21 degrees, sol am wearing everything I have got, but despite these really low temperatures the ice is highly mobile and blocks of it will force together and prise apart with the winds and currents. This kind of thing has always happened up here, but scientists say they are definitely seeing more of it. There is evidence that the ice is becoming thinner, not year by year, but decade by decade, and the thinner it becomes, the more easily breaks up. We are entering what researchers call a new era We are entering what researchers calla new era in Divers venture under the ice. Down below, the brightest feature is the whole leading back to the surface. There is life down here what is called a combjelly in the dark. The ice becoming thinner means some creatures are losing their habitat. What has been seen around the Arctic is that these animals that live underneath the ice, the biodiversity of those has come down across the Arctic and also the abundance and biomass has also gone down. All this research takes place under armed guard. There is a threat from polar bears. One approached the ship while we were on board and wandered close to a survey line. No one can be sure how rapidly the ice will retreat, but researchers are finding signs of a region being transformed. David Sugarman, BBC News, in the Arctic.

Now for the weather. Not a bad bank holiday Monday but it is going downhill at the moment and tomorrow we start with some showers although it will dry out through the day. Here is the satellite picture today. You can see the cloud advancing and there is a bit of rain moving into the south of London which will track across as through the night to night. Behind, some dry interludes but some showers for the morning commute. They will be heavy with some thunder mixed in. We will then see drier and sunnier skies in the afternoon, but the winds will pick UP afternoon, but the winds will pick up as well. We will see some gusty weather tomorrow afternoon, 1+0 mph. More showers into Wednesday as well, but drying out on Thursday, with winds easing. Thank you. That is it, we will be back after the 10pm news, good evening. Good evening. A gorgeous day across much of Scotland and quite a difference in temperatures from what we saw yesterday. Extreme degrees. The 19 was spoiled in the afternoon with the introduction of some cloud moving up from the south. That cloud heralds the start of some rain this evening and overnight. It will be moving at quite a pace, some of it quite heavy and moving across England and Wales. Nestling through Northern Ireland and the Scottish Borders through Don. Chilly start with single figures but with the cloud and rain, perhaps single figures. However you look at it it will be a grey and miserable start for many. There will be showers following on behind, some of them heavy with hail and thunder. The wind is quite a feature as well, particularly by the end of the afternoon across the south-west, with gusts excess of 65 mph. There will be some warmth under the cloud and rain, but temperatures will be struggling into single figures. The rain will move west on Wednesday, circling around this with a blustery, westerly wind. That will drive in plenty of showers across the West. These will Hello. My name is Steve Coogan. I’m in an ordinary caff, having an ordinary cup of tea, because I’m an ordinary bloke. Sorry, we couldn’t do a skinny soy latte, Steve. It’s fine! Now, I was born in Manchester. I had a great childhood. My parents taught me to respect hard work, honesty and decency. We weren’t rich, but we had more than enough to go around. And even though there were six of us, my parents decided to foster other children, because for us, it wasn’t just about looking after number one and to hell with everyone else. I’ve been lucky. I’m successful and quite comfortably off, but I’ve never forgotten the values they gave me. They taught me that politics matter. A lot of people are very cynical about politics, but it’s easy to be cynical. Cynicism doesn’t change anything. Cynicism never built a school or a hospital. The great thing about the British people is that they have a sense of fairness. And when we see the Conservatives helping their rich friends avoid paying taxes, we know that’s not fair, because it means that decent, hard-working people have to pay more. If we don’t think that’s fair, we need to change it, and the way to change it is to vote Labour. The Labour Party gave this country the National Health Service. It gave us the minimum wage, because Labour believes in helping all the people, notjust the privileged few. I trust Labour with the NHS. I know they’ll take care of it. And when the Conservatives say they will, I don’t trust them. Imagine how it’ll feel if we wake up on Friday with another five years of the Tories in Downing Street. More cuts, more privatisation and the dismantling of the NHS. But it doesn’t have to be like that. Now, this election’s on a knife edge, but if you want a government that believes in working families, in a better future for our kids, that stands up for everyone, then you can have it. But you need to go out and vote for it. So vote Labour this Thursday. This election is a choice between the Tories’ failing plan and Labour’s better plan for working families. Labour understands that Britain only succeeds when working people succeed. Where there’s muck, there’s brass. Six celebrity time-travellers eat, sleep and work...

Charlotte Elizabeth Diana. Did you see that name coming? Yes, gorgeous, Elizabeth and Diana. It also means prince George has become a big brother so we sent Alex Riley out to get a few tips on how to be a sibling. The Royal baby has arrive and, while we wish Kate and William all the best, save a thought for poor prince George. Now burden the responsibility of being the oldest sibling. So how should he approach this important role? Who better to ask than a group of school children. Yes, I visited a couple of primary schools to quiz a group of four to six-year-olds, with younger siblings of their own, on how prince George can excel in his role. Good mornings, everyone. Does anybody know why I’m dressed up in this costume? Because you are pretending to be the King. That’s right. There’s been some very exciting news. There’s a new Royal baby. I’m glad to get that off. I’ve got to take that back to the Tower of London tonight. When the new baby comes home. What should prince George do? Get some nappies and clothes. That’s a good idea. If it’s crying, read a book to make it stop crying. He should look after his baby. How should he look after the baby? By playing with her and not snatching. What do you think a Royal baby’s pram would be like? Heavy. What would it be made out of? Gold. A pram that’s decorated? Eye yes. What is the best thing a big brother can do? Go on the swings. They can help their little brothers and help them not to eat plants. They can tell them jokes. What kind ofjokes What do you call a sheep with no legs? A cloud. What would you sing? Twinkle, twinkle, little star, howl wonder what you are, up above the world so high, like a diamond in the sky... Gosh, you were singing, that was very soothing, I almost went to sleep then. Kids have a message for William, Kate and George. ALL:: Congratulations on your new baby! And Alex is here. Wide-awake, I might add. We have heard this name this afternoon then, Charlotte Elizabeth Diana and it comes with so many Royal connections? It certainly does. King George III who famously went mad, it was his wife Queen Charlotte. They got married in 1761. She was German. She came from a small town in the north of Germany, a simple girl in many ways. She was a wonderful patron of the arts and had a lovely warmth about her. Funnily enough, her endest son was called George and her eldest daughter was called Charlotte. There we are. In 1761, daughter was called Charlotte. There we are. In1761, King we are. In 1761, King George bought Buckingham House for her to be a nice family home, which is now Buckingham Palace. It cost £21,000 in 1761. Buckingham Palace. It cost £21,000 in1761. Bargain. Like Buckingham Palace. It cost £21,000 in 1761. Bargain. Like everybody, they have extended by now. It’s been ",,

Labour on the future of the health service, and the Lib Dems warning against the ‘politics of fear’. Why? Why? Scuffles on the streets of Glasgow as Labour’sjim Murphy accuses Scottish nationalists of disrupting a campaign rally. There is a remarkable degree of aggression. This is unacceptable. I take a very strong view that anyone in the campaign, they have been abused and these people acting on behalf of the SNP. We’re in the BBC election studio with all the news from the campaign trail, and the day’s other main stories. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have named their baby daughter Charlotte Elizabeth Diana. A report from one devastated village in Nepal where hundreds died in the recent earthquake. And we visit the scientists in the Arctic who say a ‘new era’ is about to dawn. Later on BBC London: More than 100 front-line security guards are having their licenses revoked, following a BBC London undercover investigation. Good evening from the BBC’s election studio. This will be our home over the coming days and this is where we’ll bring you all the results and reaction on Thursday and Friday. There are three days to polling day. The parties are trying to focus on their key messages. The Conservatives on tax and the economy. Labour on the future of the health service. But the campaign is still overshadowed by arguments about whether any party can secure an overall majority and the tactics being considered by party leaders in the event of a hung parliament. Our deputy political editor, james Landale, has more details. Please welcome the Prime Minister. For weeks they have been on them road campaigning, and with only 60 hours to go until polling stations open, it is now almost non-stop. When opinion polls are this close, every moment, every vote counts. As do celebrity endorsements. Today, Delia Smith urged voters to cook up a Labour Government. I think Delia does it like she has done it before. You sort of get that feeling. But for the Labour leader, it is not endorsements but the NHS that he hopes may help win over undecided voters. We face a big choice on Thursday, about the future of our National Health Service. We will be fighting against the Conservative plan for deeper cuts, privatisation and a plan which would undermine the NHS as we know it. I will spend the last 72 hours of this campaign fighting to rescue our NHS from the grave danger posed by David Cameron. The man in question spent the day wooing swing voters in the south-west of England, promising tax cuts for 30 million people and warning voters the only choice at this election was between him and the Labour leader. Ed Miliband, I rememberwho got hurt in the crash. It wasn’t the bankers, they got away with the bonuses and the pensions and the knighthoods you gave them. I will tell you who got hurt. It was the low paid, the people who lost theirjobs, the families who could not make it through. Don’t you ever dare lecture us about how to help the many in our country, how to help working people in our country! Think about what we’ve done! APPLAUSE. # For he’s a jolly good fellow... And so say these Lib Dems. The Prime Minister, in their view, is not such a good fellow. Today, seniorfigures in the party claimed Mr Cameron had told Nick Clegg in private that the Tories would not get a majority. A claim the Tories denied. A claim Mr Clegg did not quite confirm in public. He hopes if he wins here and elsewhere the Lib Dems can offer stability in another coalition. I have never met a senior Conservative who has told me quietly they actually think they will win this election outright. By the way, what they said privately is correct. They will not win this election outright and they are now basically communicating a big fat fib that they are going to win a majority with 23 seats. So, the campaign goes on. Already minds are turning towards who will do a deal with whom on Friday morning if no party wins outright. The election may be over soon, the haggling may take longer. The Scottish National Party has denied its supporters were responsible for scuffles on the streets of Glasgow when Labour’s jim Murphy struggled to make himself heard, as demonstrators disrupted a campaign rally in the city centre. Tonight, the SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, has been addressing a public meeting in Dumfries. Our Scotland correspondent, james Cook, is there. We can inhim now. Yes, thank you very much. 500 people came here this evening to listen to Nicola Sturgeon speak. She was setting out how she and her party would deal with a hung parliament that is a real possibility. More on It began as a stroll in the summer sunshine. Scottish polls, taking the campaign to the streets. But a small group of protestors had other ideas. These demonstrators have dogged jim Murphy and his supporters since last year’s referendum. jim Murphy has been here for 15 or so minutes, to be honest we have not heard anything he’s said. He’s been drowned out by protestors who have been chanting ""red Tories out."" It has at some points been nasty. This was street politics in the raw. Mr Murphy, justify the Iraq war. justify the Iraq war. Campaign on behalf of nationalism, ahead in the polls... It is a remarkable degree of aggression. It is unacceptable. It is very toxic come from nationalists. We are putting forward a point of view. The idea of shouting over it, that is not really democracy. Are you proud of what you have done here today? I am proud. We got the message across. Why These people are war criminals. Expenses cheats. We have people going to food banks. They claim to represent the working class. This is democracy is it shouting in people’s faces? It is dead. Nicola Sturgeon does not think so. Sky high in the polls, the last thing she needs is any bad behaviour. Anybody can campaign without being abused. This is a fantastic election campaign. We should all be out there putting forward positive messages and engaging positively with the people of Scotland. But in this campaign, nothing seems to ruffle the SNP for long. The party leader is treated more like a POP party leader is treated more like a pop star than a politician. And so Ms Sturgeon is crafting a message, designed to be deployed if her party sweeps the board in Scotland. The test of legitimacy which is applied to whatever Westminster Government is formed after this election cannot simply be that it is the largest party in England. One test that must be applied is whether a Government can build a majority and win support that reflects the whole of the UK. Is the SNP closer than ever to a general election victory in Scotland? Well, these supporters believe that change is in the air. Now, some more of the day’s election news. The Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, has been campaigning in Margate one of the seats the party hopes to win. He spoke of the ‘very real danger’ that he said Islamic extremists posed to the UK. He said people were ‘fearful’ that extremists could enter the UK by crossing the Mediterranean with migrants from North Africa. The Green Party leader, Natalie Bennett, has accused Britain’s biggest parties of trying to sound tougher on immigration than Ukip. Campaigning in north London, she claimed the Greens would never blame migrants for the failure of Government policies, and she called for an ‘open and caring’ Britain. The entertainer Russell Brand, who recently interviewed Ed Miliband, has given his backing to Labour. He’s previously urged people not to vote at all, but changed his stance saying there was a need to end what he called ‘the danger of the Conservative Party’. So, at the start of this final week of campaigning, let’sjoin james Landale at Westminster. And james, your thoughts on the focus is sharp on what happens after Friday? That is right. The parties are still campaigning furiously for every last undecided voter. Attention is focussing on what happens on Friday morning. If the polls are right and we have no idea if they are right- if they are right, what happens if no one party wins an overall majority? What happens if the cold maths of that result does not automatically tells us which party or parties should try and form that Government? Because of that uncertainty, debate is beginning to turn to this question of legitimacy. Which parties might try and legitimately form a Government? If the Conservatives win more votes than seats they should be declared the winners and have the first go at forming a Government. That is why some in Labour tell me, look if they come second they may have to do a minority coalition with the Liberal Democrats. That is why you have Nicola Sturgeon injames Cook’s report talking about a test of legitimacy for any Westminster Government and whether or not it reflects views in Scotland. The constitutional experts will tell you this is nonsense, all that matters is which party can demand the confidence of the House of Commons. But the battle for public opinion will have an impact on that. It is a battle that has already begun. james, thanks very much. More on the election a little later. But let’s turn to the day’s other news. Kensington Palace has announced that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have named their baby daughter Charlotte Elizabeth Diana. She was born on Saturday and is fourth in line to the throne. Her formal title will be Princess Charlotte of Cambridge. Our Royal correspondent, Nicholas Witchell, reports. Two days old and now with a very grown-up-sounding name and title. Her Royal Highness Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, or to give her her full names, Charlotte Elizabeth Diana, a set of names chosen by William and Catherine which strongly embrace their daughter’s Royal pedigree, but which are also known to be favourites within the Middleton family. Charlotte, her principal name, is the name of Catherine’s younger sister, Pippa. It’s also the female variation of her grandfather’s name Charles, so there’s a link to both sides of the family. Elizabeth, clearly in tribute to her great-grandmother, the Queen, who was visibly delighted by the news on Saturday of the birth of her fifth great-grandchild, and then that third name, the reasons for which really need no explanation. That this newly-born Princess has Diana as one of her names fulfils William’s deeply-held wish that his beloved mother should not be forgotten. First reactions to the names seem to be positive. I like the Diana part, yeah. Seems - that seems appropriate somehow, yeah. That’s lovely. I love the name Charlotte, it’s nice and traditional and the fact they have Diana in there means a lot for the family, so really happy, really pleased. And in choosing Charlotte, William and Catherine have selected a name which, while traditional, is also something fresh. It hasn’t been used by the Royal Family for many generations. I think they have almost certainly chosen Charlotte because they like the name and I think one of the things that we have come to respect about Prince William and Catherine is that they do exactly what they want to do and I think that’s rather nice. The birth of the fourth in line to the throne was marked today by gun salutes at the Tower of London and in Hyde Park within earshot of William and Catherine’s London home at Kensington Palace. Tomorrow, the Queen will be back at Buckingham Palace and it’s thought that that may be the opportunity for her to meet her newest great-grandchild, Charlotte Elizabeth Diana. The choice of names represents tradition and sentiment in Elizabeth and Diana and, in Charlotte, it’s a name which, in due course, will give this new Princess an opportunity to establish an identity of her own. Nicholas Witchell, BBC News, at Kensington Palace. As more bodies are recovered from the rubble in Nepal, officials say they fear as many as 10,000 people died in the earthquake. The authorities say it’s still impossible to verify exact numbers. Injust one village - Langtang - a popular trekking destination north of Kathmandu - hundreds of people died when buildings were destroyed by an avalanche and landslide. Our South Asia correspondent, justin Rowlatt, is the first reporter to reach the area. I should warn you, his report contains some distressing images. Langtang is reckoned to be one of the most beautiful valleys in the Himalayas. But it is now a scene of almost indescribable horror. I’m on a reconnaissance trip with two British Gurkhas to the worst-hit village in Nepal. We land at the next village up the valley. At least one British tourist is missing in Langtang, a 23-year-old man - there may be many more. There’s lots of damage here, but it is nothing to what is to come. Langtang village was one of the most popular trekking destinations in Nepal and home to 435 people. But there is virtually nothing left. The earthquake caused a massive avalanche and a landslide. It’s hard to believe but 55 hotels and guesthouses and the villagers’ homes are gone under this great tongue of ice and rock. just one house remains. We lost everything. Did you lose members of your family? Yes, yes. My mum and my brothers and all villagers, they lost everybody, they lost their families. And no-one has nothing. Now we have nothing. This is the old village? This is the old village. Where there’s the ice, that was a guesthouse. We can’t see the guesthouse, there’s so many glaciers. So, all the ice has come down and covered the guesthouse? Yes, Sir. Covered the guesthouse. It happened quick and, after about one minute, it is coming, avalanche, and like all rock fall down, we cannot see anything, it was middle of night like that. It was nearly lunch time so the tea houses and restaurants were busy. There are 52 bodies here. They’ve separated them into different groups. Here are the Nepalese people who have died, the people from the village. There’s a group of people who were working in the village. And then here are the foreigners. While we were there, they recover another body, a young female tourist. The rescue teams say it could be weeks before they find them all. justin Rowlatt, BBC News, Langtang. In America, two gunmen, killed by police after a failed attack outside a community centre in Dallas last night, have been named. US media reports say police officials have identified the suspects as Elton Simpson - seen here - and Nadir Soofi. The gunmen were shot dead by an officer after they opened fire on police at the centre hosting a competition to draw cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed. The former Tottenham and England strikerjimmy Greaves is in intensive care in hospital after suffering a severe stroke. jimmy Greaves - who’s 75 - played in the opening games of England’s World Cup-winning campaign of 1966. He’s fourth on the list of all-time England goalscorers, behind Sir Bobby Charlton, Gary Lineker and Wayne Rooney. Our correspondent, james Reynolds, reports from the Sicilian port of Augusta. In the Mediterranean spring, the world’s most dangerous migrant journey gets slightly easier. Here, the Italian Coastguard goes to rescue one overcrowded boat. Since Friday, Italy has picked up more than 7,000 migrants in one of its busiest ever series of rescues. This baby was born during a rescue. She’s been given an Italian name - Francesca Marina. This afternoon, we watched the country count its new arrivals one by one. Every rescued migrant gets a number and an official photo. They wait under the sun with nothing to do. This boy is fascinated by a nearby police jeep. Italy’s made him and his family sit away from everyone else because they may have a contagious disease. The numbers now being rescued will worry Italy and the European Union. This continent has to find a home for all these people and there may be thousands more migrants in North Africa getting ready to make this trip to Europe. Across the barrier, I met Mohammed, he’s a 30-year-old mechanic from Eritrea. He’s thinking of heading to Britain. Do you know people in the UK? In Birmingham? Are you going to go and join your brother in Birmingham? Maybe? His fellow migrants may now expect to see this British ship coming to get them. The HMS Bulwark, here on recent duty in Gallipoli, is now ready tojoin Italy’s search and rescue mission. james Reynolds, BBC News, Augusta. The Arctic is entering what’s being described as a ‘new era’ as temperatures rise and the ice becomes thinner. Scientists taking part in an expedition run by the Norwegian Polar Institute have been studying levels from a boat positioned in the Arctic ice pack. Our science editor, David Shukman, has been aboard some 300 miles north of Svalbaad and he sent this report. Science at its most extreme. Out on the frozen Arctic Ocean, researchers are braving punishing cold to measure the ice below them. In recent years, it has become thinner. The Arctic is changing. We have consistently underestimated the pace of change over recent years. There are reasons to think that this will continue. And the most important thing with a changing Arctic is that it also affects weather and climate elsewhere. The expedition was launched in the eerie dark of the polar winter in january. A research vessel, The Lance, stationed in the ice pack, acting as a mothership for the scientists. With conditions like these, very little research has been done at this time of the year. Our time-lapse camera captures how the ice is in constant motion, ripped apart right beside the ship in less than two hours. It’s -21, so I’m wearing everything I’ve got. Despite these really low temperatures, the ice is highly mobile. Great blocks of it being forced together and prised apart with the winds and the current. This kind of thing has always happened up here, but scientists say they are definitely seeing more of it. There is evidence that the ice is becoming thinner, not year by year, but decade by decade. The thinner it becomes, the more easily it breaks up. We’re entering what researchers call a new era in the Arctic. Divers venture under the ice. Down below, the brightest feature is the hole leading back to the surface. There is life down here - what’s called a a combjelly pulsating in the dark. The ice becoming thinner means some creatures are losing their habitat. What has been seen around the Arctic is that these animals that live underneath the ice, the biodiversity of those has gone down across the Arctic, and also their abundance and biomass have also gone down. All this research takes place under armed guard. There’s a threat from polar bears. One approached the ship while we were on board and wandered close to a survey line. No-one can be sure how rapidly the ice will retreat but researchers are finding signs of a region being transformed. David Shukman, BBC News, in the Arctic. Some more on the election. With just three days to go, as both Conservatives and Labour continue to insist that they can win a working majority, despite the consistent message from the opinion polls suggesting it’s unlikely. jeremy Vine is here in the election studio, with his guide to some of Thursday’s key battles. Thank you. The electoral map of Britain is surely changing and if the polls are to be believed, Labour may lose dozens of seats here in Scotland. So, they need to make them UP Scotland. So, they need to make them up with gains of Conservative blue seats or the Liberal Democrat orange seats in England and Wales. How do they do that? Look at their battle board here and these are the most marginal seats that Labour are targeting, the closest from last time, Warwickshire North, and so on, they need to go across this board like a knife through butter, 32 seats here. The next board is a bit less marginal and here it gets more sticky. Ipswich, Conservative. This one, Dundee East, held by the SNP, on paper, they are unlikely to gain. It still may not be enough if there have been big gains in Scotland, so we go to board three, containing seats 70, 80 and 90. Great Yarmouth requires a 5% swing. They may need to go beyond this board. Labour may need to look at seats like this if the Scottish gains are very big, Dorset South. For the Conservatives, they have to defend these seats, but have a look at the next battleground. Here we have Conservative seats, the seats they are targeting and here it is more tricky. The red seats were gained under Gordon Brown, they are unlikely to be relinquished by Ed Miliband so they are looking at the Liberal Democrat seats, seats like Solihull and Dorset, but the problem is, they are their coalition partners. Two big questions outside Scotland in this election - partners. Two big questions outside Scotland in this election - how well can the Conservatives fend off Labour? And how effectively can they eat into the seats held by their own coalition partners? During the election campaign, we’ve been hearing from voters across the UK about the issues that concern them. Tonight, we hear from fisherman john McAlister. My name isjohn McAlister. I am 60 years of age. I run a family business on the west coast of Scotland in Oban. The ocean, we’ve got to look after it. It’s been good to me for the last 1+5 years and it’ll be good for another 1+5 or 50 years if we fish it sustainable. As a person that runs a family business, I feel that we do not get support from our governments, whether it be Scotland, or England. We constantly hear that they’re supporting small businesses, but they’re bogging us down with red tape, paperwork. This scallop has just been caught. It will not be the shortage of shellfish or fish that will put us out of business, it’ll be where we’re allowed to fish and when we’re allowed to fish. I want to see a future for my family to come with the fishing that I’m doing today. Fisherman john McAlister with his thoughts on the election issues that matter. In a moment, time for all the news where you are. We’ll be back tomorrow with the latest on the campaign from the BBC Election Studio, but, for now, thanks for watching and have a good night. Welcome to BBC London News. More than 100 front-line security guards are having their licenses revoked following an undercover investigation by BBC London into fraudulent colleges. Those wanting to work legitimately have to sit exams, but we discovered some colleges were accepting cash from candidates to help them cheat. Guy Lynn reports. It is supposed to be a high-level exam, testing trainee bodyguards. This was the reality we found, at Ashley Commerce Training College in Ilford. Students were told to dupe the authorities by a former airport security instructor. Dates were forged. Answers dictated. They were told to lie about high-level training on forms. This was wide-scale fraud, where students paid to pass exams, to get licenses required by law to work in this industry. And now the Security Industry Authority has begun revoking those licenses. 129 front-line security guards, potentially guarding some of the UK’s most sensitive buildings, are now being barred. We understand the police are also investigating and that this is only the start of the crackdown. What is quite so spectacular about this fraud that has taken place and 129 licenses being fraudulently issued, we are talking about individuals protecting installations, corporate headquarters, nightclubs, bars, potentially vulnerable persons and even children and families. The manager at Ashley College denied wrongdoing. This is him laughing about fictitious training he arranged. And the moment we caught up with theirtrainer... Will you get out of my face? We want to know why you have been forging exams for students to pass very serious qualifications. The examination body overseeing the college’s qualifications has now concluded a separate investigation. More than 250 exams have been revoked and the fraud described as ""significant and systematic"". Yet there are still questions about numerous other places in the capital we heard were cheating the authorities and putting the publicat risk. Police have confirmed a man has been murdered in Wandsworth Prison. The victim is believed to be in his 60s and next of kin have been informed.

Remembering the Lusitania and her passengers 100 years after the luxury liner was sunk by a German submarine in the First Wold War. Later on BBC London, the problems voters in Hackney are facing at the polling booth. Plus, your local and national forecast is coming up. Good afternoon, and welcome to the BBC News At One. Millions of people are casting their vote to decide who will form the next government. Around 50,000 polling stations opened at 7am and will close at 10pm. The first results are expected before midnight. As well as the general election, there are more than 9,000 council seats being contested across 279 English local authorities, and mayors will be elected in six English towns and cities. Here’s our political correspondent Eleanor Garnier. They were queuing in Kent before 7am. Up and down the country, millions will get their chance to vote and decide the fate of politicians across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Ed Miliband and his wife were beaten to the polling booth at a village hall in Yorkshire by half a dozen early voters. TV crews waiting. The Ukip leader made an early morning trip to vote, Natalie Bennett of the Greens voted in London, Nicola Sturgeon posed for photos with her husband after voting in Glasgow. And in Oxfordshire, the Conservative Party leader, David Cameron, voted at a village call with his wife, Samantha. The Plaid Cymru leader, Leanne Wood, went to the polls in south Wales. The Lib Dem leader, Nick Clegg, cast his ballot at a community send in South Yorkshire with his wife Miriam at his side. But others went to a farm shop to vote, like here in Nottinghamshire. For some, it meant a trip to church or even a pub car park for this converted community bus. Polling stations are open in Northern Ireland, where there are 18 constituencies. Around 50 million people are registered to vote across the UK, and they can cast a vote at one of around 50,000 polling stations. But it is notjust about Westminster. Thousands of council seats are up for grabs, and six mayors are also being elected. The politicians have done the talking, and now it is up to the voters to have their say. The polls close at 10pm tonight, and then the counting begins. Eleanor Garnier, BBC News, Westminster. So just how does the voting process to elect 650 Members of Parliament in the UK work? Christian Fraser explains. Yes, we’re going to show you some big numbers that will define the result of the UK general election. This is how many people in 2015 are registered to vote, some A5 million people across the UK. Now, back in 2010, the turnout was 65% of those who had registered, which meant some 30 million people in the end cast a ballot, and we expect it to be something similar time around. There are some things you cannot do any UK polling station. There is no explicit law, actually, about selfies, the taking of yourself with a camera, but the Electoral Commission does discourage it. It likes to protect the secrecy of the ballot. They also discourage party insignia on T-shirts or any clothing in case it is seen as intimidating. We have a peculiar fashion of rosettes here in the UK, that is reserved just for candidates and for polling agents on the day of the vote. And then, ten o’clock, this thing happens, as the constituencies dash and try to count as many votes as they can to become the first constituency to return a result. And last time, the accolade was held by a constituency in the north-east of England, Houghton and Sunderland South, who counted all these votes injust 52 minutes, 10:52 at night they returned their result. We do expect, incidentally, a first exit poll at around ten o’clock, but most of the constituencies will start to return results between three and five o’clock in the morning local time on Friday. 650 constituencies around the UK. Remember that it is a first past the post system here in the UK, so vote share does not necessarily equal number of seats. But the number you need to bear in mind as the result comes in is 326. That is the magic line - the magic number of seats that a party has to get for an absolute majority in the lower house, the House of Commons, here in the UK.

And don’t forget, we’ll have all the election results in a special programme from 9:55 on BBC One tonight. People who lost valuables when thieves raided a safe deposit company in central London are meeting to discuss ways of getting compensation. Police say 72 deposit boxes in Hatton Garden were broken into over the Easter weekend. Despite appeals and a reward, no-one has been arrested. jon Brain is in Hatton Garden. Simon, it is now five weeks since the heist which took place about 100 yards up the road from here, and it has taken that long for the full impact of what happened to come through. Many people, of course, lost a lot of money. Some of the biggest losers have been here today to discuss what - if biggest losers have been here today to discuss what- if anything - biggest losers have been here today to discuss what- if anything - they can do about it. Victims say the time has come for action. This morning they have been meeting in this building to decide whether they can sue those they blame for failing to protect their valuables. One individual has told me that he cannot actually bring himself to put down on paper what has gone from his box, because it was his pension. He had planned to retire at a certain time. He now cannot do that. So it is a very sad state of affairs. It was the hole in the wall that coughed up millions. This was the scene the raiders at Hatton Garden left behind. They had entered the building by a side door. They went UP building by a side door. They went up to the second floor, where they disabled the lift before climbing down to the basement where the safety deposit boxes were. They prised open nation and cut through bars. They then drilled their way into the vault and Lviv 72 of the 999 boxes. -- into the vault and Lviv 72 of the 999 boxes. -- looted. Box owners want to know why the police failed to respond to the alarm. Scotland Yard could also be facing legal action. Well, that meeting hasjust broken UP Well, that meeting hasjust broken up within the last couple of minutes. We are told it was very sombre, but the safety box owners were told that they are very unlikely to get their money back. Simon. jon Brain, thank you. BT says it hopes a £12 billion deal to take over the country’s biggest mobile network, EE, will get the go-ahead from regulators by autumn. That’s despite objections from rivals, who say the company would have too much power. Our personal finance correspondent Simon Gompertz reports. It started with this, then BT added the internet. Now football on TV. And next, they want to be the biggest mobile provider as well by taking over EE, so shouldn’t be allowed? It is capitalism, isn’t it? That is what this country is built on, you cannot argue with it. If it is a bigger company, maybe we will have a better chance of getting a good signal. A lot of power going to one, especially BT, I think they should scrap it, I don’t think they should do it. The bigger the package BT manages to sell you, the bigger the monthly payment, and the more likely you are to stay with them. BT says that with a big mobile company, it will be able to offer its customers more and be more competitive, but remember, EE brings with it both team mobile and Orange. BT’s rivals fear it will be too big and too powerful. Talk Talks said BT should be for is to sell off its UK infrastructure for the internet, which most of its rivals use, to cut it down to size, but analysts are expecting the takeover to go through. This is a landline company merging with a mobile operator, so there is much less competition concerns than you would get if two companies in precisely the celebrating a jump authority would approve the takeover by September. Simon Gompertz, BBC There have been emotional scenes at the inquest of two children who died of carbon monoxide poisoning whilst on a holiday in Corfu. Their mother confronted the former boss of tour operator Thomas Cook as he gave evidence in the witness box. Manny Fontela-Novoa had earlier declined to answer questions about the deaths of seven-year-old Christy and six-year-old Bobby during a holiday booked with his company in 2006. The children’s mother Sharon Wood told him he should speak up for himself. Fiona Trott is at the inquest. just give us the background to this case. Well, Christy and Bobby Shephard were on holiday with their father in 2006, they were found dead in a hotel bedroom by the hotel chambermaid. They died from carbon monoxide poisoning, Andy Drury has heard that a -- monoxide poisoning, Andy Drury has heard that a -- and the jury has found that a nearby boiler was faulty, and the system for checking boilers did not include external boilers. The former boss of Thomas Cook had declined to give evidence, why? He was exercising his legal right to silence, and this was after the coroner told him, this is not a trial, but there is the potential you might be involved in future criminal proceedings, and you do not have to answer questions which might incriminate you. Leslie Thomas OC put it to him that the system for checking boilers was defective, that the company put profit over safety, but to each of those suggestions the former CTO declined to answer. The lawyer suggested he apologise, and he said, I deeply regret what occurred. He said, do not look at me, look them in the eye. The former CEOs said, ideally regret the incidents that occurred, and that is when Sharon Woods said, speak up for yourself, then. Earlierthe when Sharon Woods said, speak up for yourself, then. Earlier the coroner read from a police statement, Manny Fontela-Novoa said in 2009, Ido not know why the hotel manager misled us about the existence of external gas heaters. just a few moments ago the current CEO was asked what he might say to the families, and he said, I feel incredibly sorry, but I do not have to apologise, the system has changed and there was no wrongdoing by Thomas Cook. It was one of those moments of hope in the midst of the tragedy of the Nepal earthquake, a teenager was pulled alive from the rubble five days after he was trapped in the debris of the guest house where he worked. Pemba Tamang said he didn’t know if he was alive or dead as he lay buried for all that time. Our correspondent Yogita Limaye was there when Pemba was rescued This was the moment 15-year-old Pemba saw daylight again after more than five days under the rubble. For rescuers who worked frantically to save him... CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ..it was a glimmer of hope. Hello, Pemba. One week on, I visit Pemba. He is already out of hospital and sitting at home with his friends. A mini-celebrity now, everyone is interested in his story. TRANSLATION: I’m fine, my body is aching, Whenever I’m alone and inside a room, Ifeel scared. But when I’m walking outside, I don’t. For a boy who has been through so much, doctors are amazed at how strong Pemba is. He survived by eating clarified butter. But the experience still haunts him. TRANSLATION: At first, I heard voices of other people, but later on they were gone. It was dark there, sometimes I felt I was dead, sometimes I felt I was alive, I didn’t know for sure. I don’t feel particularly lucky, but I keep wondering how I survived. This is all that is left of the guesthouse where Pemba worked. His job was to bring tourists to stay there. For the boy who made headlines around the world, it’s time to return to normal life again and find anotherjob. Pemba says he wants to be a taxi driver. Yogita Limaye, BBC News, Kathmandu. Our top story this lunchtime: Millions of people across the UK are going to the polls today, casting their votes in the general election. ~ I will be live in southern Ireland to mark the 100th anniversary of the thinking of the Lusitania. --, one. Graham Taylor has denied he was asked by the football association to limit the number of black players to select in the national side. It was one of the greatest civilian disasters of World War One. 1200 people lost their lives when the Cunard passenger boat Lusitania was sunk by a German torpedo. One of the largest ships in the world, it was sailing from New York to its home port of Liverpool when it was sunk off the coast of Ireland. Today marks 100 years since the tragedy, and a number of special events are being held in commemoration, including a memorial service in Cove. Duncan Kennedyjoins us from there now. The playing a wreath -- might laying. We still do not really know what happened. On this day, 100 years later, we will remember. At the exact spot where the Lusitania went down came the first of today’s commemoratives events. 11 miles out at sea, relatives and descendants of those who died came to pay their respects. The Lusitania was the world’s most luxurious liner, but the Germans regarded even civilian ships as targets. A U-boat fired a devastating torpedo and the Lusitania sank. Billy from Liverpool was just 15 and survived. We pulled quite a few people into the boat even though the boat was full already. They got to about 50 yards out and there was a whoosh and the ship upended and sank. 100 years on, the wreck of the Lusitania is at the centre of a major archaeological row. The Irish government has banned anything being taken off but her owner says that is preventing a full investigation into what happened. It is totally irrational, the fact we are being stopped. It is a matter of closure. This is a major historical event. As we all know, it brought America into the war eventually. There were a few more things that had to happen. It needs to be put to rest. Today at Cove Cathedral they remembered the 1200 people who died. The rawness in this community still evident 100 years on. Today we commemorate, as you know, one of the darkest days of the last century, a day of infamy. The Lusitania was a disaster that helped change history. On its centenary, her secrets remain as profound as the tragedy. We know that the Lusitania was carrying thousands of rounds of ammunition but the Irish government says there should be no diving and she should be left as a warm or real, but particularly archaeologists are saying that the time is right to go down and take off artefacts and give an explanation for the families as to what happens -- war memorial. Israel’s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has reached an eleventh hour deal to create a new coalition government. The agreement, seven weeks after his Likud party won the election, came just two hours before a deadline. The deal, with the right-wing jewish Home Party, guarantees Mr Netanyahu the slimmest possible majority, controlling 61 seats in the 120-member parliament. There are a total of five parties in the new government. The European Commission is setting up a taskforce of experts to review aviation safety regulation, including pilot health checks, following the Germanwings crash. The flight’s co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz, had suffered from severe depression and is accused of deliberately crashing the plane, killing all 150 people on board. A pilot who was forced to give up his career because of stress has said reported mental health problems in the industry are just the tip of the iceberg. He’s been speaking to our Health Editor, Hugh Pym. After more than 30 years in the airline industry, this pilot’s career was brought to an end by stress and depression. He doesn’t want to be identified. He told us how the mental strain had finally overwhelmed him. Ijust found it impossible to go to work. I felt very close to tears, as I had done on various occasions at the end of shifts, without really understanding what was happening. I just couldn’t really function on any level. His view is that unsocial rotas and the pressure for quick turnarounds at airports are creating unacceptable pressures on pilots. We do very long duty days, with multiple flights during the day. The physiological effects on one’s body of compression and decompression, it can be extremely stressful as the companies continue to ask for more and more. He was treated here. This holiday villa in southern Portugal is, in reality, a mental health clinic. About a fifth of patients are pilots, and the number is increasing. Providing they go through a recognised 28-day treatment pI’OgI’8I’|'IITIâ... One of the therapists who runs the clinic told me how a pilot can often cover up a personal crisis. Because of the stigma behind it, because of the risk of losing theirjob, or the fear of losing theirjob, a lot of people would keep that hidden. 90% of their pilot patients do eventually get back to work, but it takes time and continuing help. There are some airlines with explicit policies designed to encourage pilots to come forward if they’re facing stress or related issues. There are clear commitments that theirjobs will not be at risk, and that they will be supported in dealing with mental health problems. The International Air Transport Association told us: The deliberate crash of a plane by a co-pilot with a mental health history has led to calls for the annual medical assessment of pilots to be made more rigorous. Whether it is a rogue trader in a bank, whether it is an airline pilot who is not simply suicidal but homicidal, there is always that risk that that person will literally go under the radar. However, with closer monitoring, more scrutiny of pilots, it is less likely to happen. The investigation into the Germanwings crash is not complete, but that hasn’t stopped a wider debate about the wellbeing of pilots, and what more can be done to secure safety in the skies. A 27-year-old man has been arrested by police investigating the murder of a former senior IRA figure in Belfast. Gerard Davison was shot on his way to work on Tuesday. A lI1-year-old man arrested yesterday has been released without charge. A medieval castle high above an Alpine valley, a group of prisoners fearful for their lives, and a daring rescue mission where enemies fight side by side. It’s a story that could have come straight out of Hollywood, but it happened for real, 70 years ago, in the last week of the Second World War in Europe. Robert Hall reports from the Tyrol in Austria. This is Itter, an Austrian village known for its beauty and its skiing, a village isolated from the hurly- burly of the world below, but for a few violent hours in 1945, the war intervened. Among the images of Itter’s ancient castle in the village archive, two photos from the years when it became a high-security prison. Itter’s hostages included two former French Prime Ministers and two captured army commanders. The final orders were clear- if the prisoners were of no use as a bargaining chip with Allied forces, they were to be executed. As the Allied armies got closer, the castle’s guards fled. But there was still a real danger from bands of die-hard SS troops roaming these forests, so a member of staff, a Czech, decided to go for help. Five miles down the Valley, he found this man, Sepp Gangl, a veteran German officer now working with the Austrian resistance. Gangljumped in a Kuebelwagen with a driver and a big white flag, and he found the closest American unit, and the person he found was a US Captain called jack Lee. Led by Lee and Gangl, a small group of US and German soldiers with one tank made their way to the castle. Within hours, they were surrounded and under attack from the SS. Though outnumbered, the Gls, Germans and elderly prisoners managed to hold out for 12 hours until an American relief column got through. Only one person lost their life inside Schloss Itter, Sepp Gangl would not return to his wife and young son. Sepp Gangl was a very courageous man, and he did the right thing at the right time on the end of the war. If the SS had managed to get into the castle and kill all these French VIPs, the history of postwar France would have been radically different. These people, several of them formulated policies that carried France into, well, the 21st century. Today Itter is just another village in a glorious landscape. But what happened here 70 years ago is more than a footnote to a world conflict. Robert Hall, BBC News, Austria. One of the most memorable figures of the Second World War was the Forces’ Sweetheart Vera Lynn. She entertained on the home front, and on the front line, taking her songs like ""We’ll Meet Again"" and ""the White Cliffs of Dover"" to Allied troops around the world. To mark 70 years since people found out the war with Germany was over, Dame Vera has been sharing her memories. This letter of mine is getting to be a sort of rendezvous where husbands and wives, torn apart by war, can be brought together by music. I had been making broadcasts with messages from the boys to their families here and vice versa and they thought I was the girl next-door type person and they could feel comfortable with me. # We’ll meet again # Don’t know where # Don’t know when # But I know we’ll meet again some sunny day. # So, of course, with the situation as it was, with the boys going away, it was a perfect song for me to choose as my signature tune. # ‘til the blue skies drive the dark clouds far away. # I thought it would be nice if I could actually go out there to entertain them and talk to them in person. Me and 6000 men! # There’ll be bluebirds over the White Cliffs of Dover...# When the boys were leaving home, that was the thing they waved goodbye to, the White Cliffs, and the one thing that greeted them when they were coming back. So it was a symbol, it was something that meant something to them. I was just an ordinary little girl in East Ham, brought up. It is nice to know that people, ordinary people, can achieve something in some way in their life. # There’ll be love and laughter and peace ever after # Tomorrow when the world is free. # Tomorrow marks the 70th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day, and there will be a special service of remembrance at the Cenotaph in London, which will be shown on BBC One at 2:30pm.

But first with the day’s sport, here’s Hugh Wuzencroft at the BBC Sports Centre. The Former England manager Graham Taylor says he was never spoken to by the Football Association about the number of black players he picked to play for the national team. The former Watford and Aston Villa manager also denies allegations in a new book that he revealed the information to a former player. Robert Heath has more. Pitch Black, Abu Ghraib and by Emy Onuora -- Pitch Black, Abu Ghraib and by Emy Onuora -- a book written by Emy Onuora. He claims that Graham Taylor told in two members of the FAA asked him not to pick too many black players when he was manager of the England side. -- players when he was manager of the England side. -- the FA. There is no suggestion that he complied with any of these requests, and I think his record is an excellent one. Nonetheless, I am confident that the story is true. I certainly never, during my time, at the Football Association had any people coming up to me and telling me what team to pick and to pick less black players. I would have remembered that, pick and to pick less black players. Iwould have remembered that, I would have been extremely annoyed if I had, because my record as regards the selection of black players at both club and international level, people have only got to see that. The FA has told BBC Sport it is aware of the allegations, adding thatit aware of the allegations, adding that it takes these matters very seriously and is proud of the diverse nature of the England team. Spanish giants Barcelona all but sealed a place in this season’s European Champions League final with a 3-0 win over Bayern Munich last night. But it was one of their current heroes who once again stole all the headlines, as Ben Croucher reports. When Lionel Messi is at his best, he is unplayable, and last night he was at his best and then some. Maybe even the Nou Camp was not prepared for another Messi masterclass alongside some of the greatest footballers on the planet. The diminutive figures stood tallest of all. With Barcelona struggling to break down a stubborn Bayern Munich defence, they passed it to Messi and let him do the rest. He was majestic but not a patch on what he did next, two World Cup winners defeated in two seconds. Not satisfied with setting the field are light, he ignited social media as well, meeting the approval of footballers past and present, including Gary Lineker. And although Messi may not have played in the Premier League, he is not short of admirers from the current crop. The Argentinian then turned provider for Neymar to seal a 3-0 win overthe turned provider for Neymar to seal a 3-0 win over the German champions. Messi was playing amongst equals, but some players are more equal than others. To tennis now, and there was a very late - or early - start for Andy Murray in Madrid last night. After a series of long matches, Murray started at 1:12 in the morning local time, and he walked into a largely empty stadium in Madrid against Philipp Kohlschreiber. Hopes of an early night were dashed when the German took it to a final set, but Murray eased through that to claim a 6-li, 3-6, 6-0 triumph. Murray’s second-round win followed his first ever clay title on Monday, which also came at the German’s expense. Reigning Super Bowl champions New England Patriots could face disciplinary action over the so-called deflategate scandal that rocked American football. The Patriots went on to win the Super Bowl, but an inquiry has found that in all probability, they violated the rules by deliberately deflating the balls used in their play-off win over the Indianapolis Colts. That’s all the sport for now. Back to you, Simon. You may not like them very much, but it seems the humble ant could teach humans a thing or two, particularly in times of disaster. Research in the journal of Experimental Biology, has revealed that ants change the way they dig out and build nests, to fit the conditions, which could hold the key to better search and rescue techniques. Victoria Gill has more. They might not look very insectlike, but this swarm of robots is based on an ant colony. Each individual can’t accomplish much alone but as a team, they can move an object that is far bigger than a single machine. At the moment, we look at how to organise a very large fleet of these robots. The next step would be to create a manipulation of skills like the ants and then they could go outdoors in practical applications, like search and rescue, in places that humans have no access to or that are too hazardous for humans to performing. That is why scientists are studying the abilities of the ultimate swarm of engineers, fire ants. This species is native to South America, but they have invaded the soils of the US, China and Australia. To find out their secret, a team from the Georgia Institute of Technology set them a challenge. They filmed the anys as the excavated in containers of different types of soil, from fine powder to large coarse grains. The industrious insects would dig in anything. The excavated large brains much more quickly, grasping each in theirjaws and backing out of the tunnel. Their surprise was that the insects changed strategies in finer sand, compressing it into manageable pellets that they turn around and carry out. As well as revealing the secret of this invasive ant’s success, scientists says studying their ability environments will help the development of robots warns that can operate at the scene of a disaster. When scientists can make each one of these little robots as efficient an engineer as an ant, they can move from organising themselves to saving lives. Time for a look at the weather with Helen Willetts. This is tomorrow’s weather waiting in the winds, but today we have more sunshine, so actually not too bad if you are out and about. That said, some showers around, some Lombi cloud across the Midlands giving the odd rumble of thunder. -- lumpy. Showers could be a little bit wintry, but we have more sunshine than yesterday and later winds. Similarly so for Northern Ireland and northern England, not a bad afternoon here will stop heavy showers across Wales, the East Midlands, Lincolnshire, and one to across the south-west. Probably good dry weather in London. Showers will fade quickly through this evening and overnight, but only because we have that weather front in the Bay of Biscay coming in, cloudy skies, rain to the south-west by dawn. That will arrest the falling temperatures, but there could be mist and fog further north, and gardeners take note, a sharp frost in the Scottish blends. But it is here we will have the best of the sunshine. -- Scottish glens. Not a particularly pleasant end to the week in the West, warm, but misty and grey, temperatures below par. Through southern Scotland and northern England, a wet night on Friday with a couple of inches of rain falling before dawn. Then a gradually improving situation through Saturday, mist and local out to get rid of, but in the West the sun comes out in the afternoon. -- low cloud. Showers will fade away on Saturday night, then a frost even into southern England, a pretty chilly night. Nice days Sunday, but wet and windy weather, as you can see, spoiling it for Northern Ireland and western Scotland later in the day. Otherwise, it is warming up, 19, possibly 20 degrees in southern areas. We have been talking about the 70th anniversary of VE day. On -- in those days, the weather charts were not revealed to the public, but this is the chart from the day, Stormy weather, temperatures into the mid 20s, and we might see that early next week. Nowa reminder of our top story this lunchtime: Millions of people are casting their vote to decide who will form the next government. That’s all from us, now on BBC One it’s time Have a good afternoon. Good afternoon and welcome. I’m Alice Bhandhukravi. As voters have been to polling stations all over the capital, some residents in Hackney may not be able to cast their vote in the general election today. An IT problem has meant that up to 50 people have not been registered despite meeting the deadline. Hackney Council says most should able to vote and has advised people to present themselves at a polling station. Tomorrow is the 70th anniversary of VE Day with events across London. One of them is in the Essex village of High Easter on Saturday, when they’ll remember the day a Battle of Britain pilot fell out of the sky and virtually onto their doorstep. Hurricane pilot Maurice Mounsdon bailed out of his burning plane and landed in the village. He’s one ofjust 26 Battle of Britain pilots left to tell the story, and Shaun Peel has been to meet him at his retirement home in Menorca. Maurice is 97, and he has lived every minute of it. Born in 1918 at the end of the First World War, he went on to become a hero of the second, one of the last battle of Britain pilots. I had a shot at one of the bombers, and I was overtaking the squadron, so I turned to come back and have another go when I was hit. Maurice flew Hurricanes out of Essex, a fearless 22-year-old taking on the Luftwaffe daily. On August 31st he was shot into flames over Colchester. He burned in the cockpit. I was hit with a shell in the gravity petrol tank. It exploded, of course. It blew petrol into the cockpit, which instantly caught fire. ",,

Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. Millions of people have been going to the polls today across the country. The leaders of the main political parties cast their votes this morning. Voting ends in four hours’ time. There are 50,000 polling stations set up in schools, village halls, and even caravans and pubs for the A9 million people who registered to vote. As well as the general election, more than 9,000 council seats are being contested, and mayors will be elected in Leicester, Mansfield, Middlesbrough, Copeland, Torbay and Bedford. Our political correspondent Eleanor Garnier has more details. They were queueing in Kent before 7am. And up and down the country, millions will get their chance to vote and decide the fate of politicians across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Some ballot boxes needed a special delivery. The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, and his wife, justine, were beaten to the polling booth at a village hall in Yorkshire by half a dozen early voters. Photographers, reporters and TV crews all waiting. In Oxfordshire, David Cameron voted at a village hall, with his wife, Samantha. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg cast his ballot at a community centre in South Yorkshire with his wife Miriam at his side. The politicians have done the talking and now it is up to the voters to have their say. At the last general election, in 2010, 60 5% of those registered turned out to vote. In Kent, Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, made an early morning trip to cast his vote. Natalie Bennett, the Green Party leader, went to vote in London. In Glasgow, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon posed for photographs with her husband after voting. Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood cast her vote at an arts centre in south Wales. Others went to a farm shop to vote, like here in Nottinghamshire. For some, it was a trip to church, or even a pub car park. But wherever it is, the polls close at 10pm tonight. For more election information, you can go to the BBC News website. Follow the link to the Election 2015 page, and of course you can watch the results come in in our special programme on BBC One tonight - that begins at 9.55pm. The Afghan army has launched a major offensive against the Taliban in the north-east of Afghanistan. It is the heaviest fighting since the departure of British and other international forces at the end of last year. Taliban militants around Kunduz, backed by fighters from so-called Islamic State, have cut all road access to the town. Our correspondent David Loyn is there, and sent this report. Kunduz is surrounded by the Taliban, and to get there was too dangerous, except by plane - crossing the forbidding beauty of the Hindu Kush mountain range. On the ground, after being forced back in recent weeks, Afghan troops have launched a counteroffensive. The police are fighting alongside the army, driving the Taliban back from the outskirts of the town. GUNFIRE The sound of heavy fighting can be clearly heard in Kunduz town itself. And the Taliban are backed by the self-proclaimed Islamic State. Three of those killed were Chechen women, and the governor said a quarter of those killed in the early hours of the new government offensive were IS foreign fighters, determined to die in battle. They are fighting serious, because they come here to get killed. They are more serious than Taliban. They are technically supporting the Taliban, financially supporting the Taliban, giving training to them. Many people have fled the fighting with nothing. They are dependent for now on the goodwill of the farmers who live where they are squatters. A woman who, like many in the Afghan countryside, would not tell us her name, said that the Taliban killed all their animals. War has come to the north of Afghanistan, and these families have lost their homes. They do not know when they will be able to return. And for the first time, senior Afghan government officials are saying that the so-called Islamic State has fighters fighting alongside the Taliban. A huge humanitarian crisis is unfolding here, as tens of thousands of people are without food or other basic necessities. International agencies are moving to respond, as the Afghan armed forces take on a new and determined enemy. The boss of Thomas Cook has told an inquest that the company doesn’t need to apologise for the death of two children during one of its holidays in Corfu, because the firm had done nothing wrong. Its chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, said he was ""incredibly sorry"" for the family of Bobby and Christi Shepherd, who were six and seven years old when they were overcome by carbon monoxide fumes at a hotel complex during a family holiday in 2006. Our correspondent Fiona Trott has been following the inquest in Wakefield. What more has been said by the company today? At the beginning of the inquest, the relatives of the children said they wanted to hear from somebody higher UP wanted to hear from somebody higher up the chain at Thomas Cook, and today, they did. The current and former CEO declined to answer questions put to them. They exercised their legal right to silence. The lawyer for the families then invited the former chief executive to apologise to the relatives. Don’t look at me, look at them in the eye, he said. He turned to the family and said, I deeply regret the incident. The children’s mother then replied, speak up for yourself, then. Peter Franke Houser said -- Peter Fankhauser said, yourself, then. Peter Franke Houser said -- Peter Fankhausersaid, I feel incredibly sorry, but I do not have to apologise, there was no wrongdoing by Thomas Cook. Many of the owners of the safety deposit boxes that were broken into in London’s Hatton Garden in a highly organised raid have been told today they might never get their valuables back. So far there have been no arrests, and it is still unclear how many millions of pounds’ worth of jewellery and valuables were stolen. jon Brain is in Hatton Garden. Well, it is now five weeks since the extraordinary heist at this building, and the police do not appear to be building, and the police do not appearto be any appear to be any closer to finding those responsible. It is still not known exactly what was taken just what is clear is that some people have lost a huge amount of money. Today, some of them met in this area to try to decide what if anything they can do about it. The hole in the wall that dispensed millions. This was the scene left behind by the Raiders at Hatton Garden after they drilled through concrete five metres thick to get to the safety deposit boxes. Today, owners of those boxes met nearby to plan their response. It has emerged some did not have insurance. It is not like a natural disaster, where they have lost a roof over their heads, that eventually, some of them will find they have lost the roof over their head, because they will not be able to meet their mortgages, they cannot trade any longer. We try to be as sympathetic as possible, without being too optimistic. The heist began when the gang responsible entered the building by a side door before disabling the lift on the second floor and climbing down to the basement, where the safety deposit boxes were. They prised open the shutter and cut through bars. They then drilled their way into the vault and looted the boxes. There have been suggestions the box owners could sue those responsible for looking after their valuables. But legal experts looking after their valuables. But legal experts say they are unlikely to get their money back. There will be a lot of passing the buck in this case. The whole purpose of safety deposit boxes is secrecy and privacy. Most people, although they may have a schedule of what they have in their own box, they use safety deposit boxes precisely because they are private, or meant to be. The mystery over the contents is matched by the mystery surrounding the heist itself. Why were only 72 out of 999 boxes opened? Did the gang have inside information? And why didn’t the police respond to an alarm call? So many questions, so few answers. It is all adding to the suffering of the victims. Ceremonies have been held in Liverpool and Ireland to remember the nearly 1,200 people who drowned when the British ocean liner the Lusitania was torpedoed by a German U-boat - exactly 100 years ago. Among those who died were more than 100 Americans, and the It has been a day of moving ceremonies on both sides of the Irish Sea, in Liverpool, the home port of the Lusitania, and here in County Cork. But people have also come with questions. The main one we are getting from relatives is this - why, after 100 years, do we still not know what really happened to the Lusitania? Today was the day ordinary people gave voice to their grief and recollections of the Lusitania. Here in the cathedral, for some, the passing of 100 years has changed little. Today we commemorate one of the darkest days of the last century, a day of infamy. The Lusitania sank injust 18 minutes, following the U-boat attack. This lady’s grandparents, Frederik and Amy, and their four children, had been on board. My grandmother saw the torpedo. She managed to get into a lifeboat. Two of the children were saved, two of them drowned, and my grandfather spent three hours in the water before he was rescued. But 100 years on, the owner of the Lusitania has accused the Irish government of blocking attempts to dive on the wreck, to find out what happened. It is totally irrational, the fact that we are being stopped. This is a major historical event, as we all know. It brought America into the war, eventually. It needs to be put to rest. The Irish president, present at the commemorations today, told me the Lusitania has to remain untouched. It was, if you like, to ensure respect. It was also to enable such investigation to take place in a regulated and responsive environment. In Liverpool, they have always called her Lucy. Today, they remembered their dead, by the propeller. Flowers for a century of grief. With the Lusitania, the rules of war were a raised. Civilians became targets. Today, at the spot she sank, families came to remember the disaster which changed them - and history. Our top story this evening: Voters across the UK have been making their decisions in the general election. Coming up, the Nazi who fought side by side with Americans in the Second World War.

And - he directed and starred in Citizen Kane, now the British Film Institute is hosting a season of shows featuring Orson Wells. A new taskforce is being set up by the European Commission to review airline safety and the health of pilots. It follows the crash of a Germanwings flight last month, which killed all 150 people on board. The co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz, is accused of deliberately bringing down the plane. As Hugh Pym reports, some pilots believe that airlines should do more to support the mental wellbeing of their flight crews. It was a crash which shocked the aviation world and prompted a series of questions about safety. Now, a new enquiry will look at regulations across Europe, including pilot health checks, as the co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz, accused of deliberately downing the plane, had a history of mental illness. Nobody says it is the full explanation, but the stresses facing pilots and the monitoring of their health by airlines is under new scrutiny. One former pilot, who does not want to be identified, told me how mental strain overwhelmed him. Ijust found it impossible to go to work. I felt very close to tears, as I had done on various occasions at the end of shifts, without really understanding what was happening. I just couldn’t really function on any level. His view, he told me, is that unsocial rotas and the pressure for a quick turnaround at airports, are creating unacceptable pressures. We do very long duty days with multiple flights during the day. The physiological effects on one’s body of compression and decompression, it can be extremely stressful, as the companies continue to ask for more and more. He was treated here. This holiday villa in southern Portugal is in reality a mental health clinic. About one fifth of patients are pilots and the number is increasing. One of the therapists who runs the clinic told me how a pilot can often cover up a personal crisis. Because of the stigma behind it, because of the risk of losing thejob, or the fear of losing thejob, a lot of people would keep that hidden. Here, they think pilot ill health is a problem, but aviation experts say the industry has safety as the top priority. The industry is regulated and between the regulators and the airlines there is a lot of work being undertaken to understand this issue. I would be confident that as much as possible is being done to make sure we are in the best possible position for future safety. The new high-powered task force will hear evidence from pilots themselves, with a fresh look at what more can be done to secure safety in the skies. Hugh Pym, BBC News. About 7000 migrants arrived in Italy in the first six days of this month, according to the International Organisation for Migration. The number of people risking the journey in search of a better life has continued to rise, even though more than 1800 people are known to have died this year in the attempt to get to Europe. Quentin Sommerville has been to see Francesca Marina, the baby born after her mother was plucked from the water a few days ago. To the Italians, she’s Francesca Marina. To her mother, she’s simply called Gift. just four days old, she’s still in a serious condition after an incredible journey. Her mother, Stephanie, is recovering, too, from a ten-hour boat ride and eight hours of labour. From Nigeria, she went to Libya for work but had to escape the turmoil. So her baby was born on an Italian naval rescue ship. Why did you decide to leave Libya? Because I think, that was what I think. Maybe Italy is more good than Libya. So I decide to come Italy. Were you scared about making the journey, a very dangerous journey to make? I’m not scared. I make up my mind, so I’m not scared. Because I believe there is God. Does your husband know that you’ve made it here safely? I told him I’m here safely and have a baby, a baby girl. And he was happy. In Tripoli, Stephanie’s husband, Valentin, was at work as usual today. He told us, ""I’m already saving money for the trip. ""I hope to be with my family by Easter next year"". His wife and child had a rough time. The birth wasn’t easy, says the doctor who delivered baby Gift. TRANSLATION: With one last push, Stephanie let out a great cry, so everybody outside knew that a baby girl had been born. The other migrants started clapping and singing hymns. Even though it was in the middle of the night, the entire crew, including the captain, joined in. Without the Italian rescue services, Stephanie and Gift’s journey could have ended in tragedy. But despite the pain and the suffering of the crossing, they made it here to Sicily and to the promise of a better life. And for the tens of thousands of other migrants still waiting to cross the Mediterranean, that story is likely to inspire, rather than deter them from making their own journey. For the newest arrivals here, the perils of the journey are worth the reward. Quentin Somerville, BBC News, Sicily. In the last few minutes we have heard that 100 migrants have been rescued from the Mediterranean today by the British vessel HMS or. It is the first time the Royal Navy’s flagship has been involved in such a rescue. She’s one of the YBAs, the Young British Artists who rose to prominence in the 1990s. She’s known for suggestive self-portraits, full of visual puns and sexual metaphor. This year, Sarah Lucas has been chosen to represent Britain at the prestigious Venice Biennale. Her medium is sculpture and, as expected, she’s produced a provocative show. Will Gompertz has been speaking to her. The familiar sights and sounds of Venice in the springtime. As ever, this man-made masterpiece is swarming with tourists, and for this week only, the big shots and high rollers of the art world, here for the Venice Biennale, a kind of fine art Olympics. This is a work representing Britain, by the artist Sarah Lucas, who makes controversial sculptures that are rude and lewd, and to which we can only allude. I don’t think it’s offensive or rude to show, particularly. We’ve all got bodies. I think there’s a lot of strange taboos that we live under the influence of without thinking very much about. And I suppose the thing that tickles me is to present some of those strange areas, to open them up to the sunshine a bit. How do you want people to react? I’d like them to like it. Well, it appears that some do, and some don’t. It gives an idea of Britishness which I find faintly embarrassing. It feels as if it’s designed wilfully to provoke again and again. And it’s a bit like poking a bruise. In the end, you wonder how much longer you can get someone pushing and prodding at that point before you say, ""Stop""! So that’s the British pavilion, which I think we can agree is very yellow and quite saucy. The Welsh have also come here under separate cover, as have the Scots. They’ve taken over this grand and beautiful 16th century house in the north of Venice and filled it with the work of Glasgow-based artist Graham Fagan. He is exploring ideas about commerce, consciousness and slavery. There’s a rope made of bronze, ink drawings of his teeth, as felt by his tongue. And a video performance of a Robert Burns poem. Meanwhile, the Welsh have set up shop in a small church and former convent in which there is an exhibition of Helen Sears’ atmospheric and romantic landscapes. There are hundreds of artists here, some representing their countries, others involved in side projects, ranging from the cool to the quirky. What better way to finish a day spent looking at art than having a round of crazy golf? Let me see if I can putt this ball from France into Britain. No. Will Gompertz, BBC News, Venice. A medieval castle high above an Alpine valley, a group of prisoners fearful for their lives, and a daring rescue mission where German and American soldiers fought on the same side. As the UK prepares to mark VE Day, Robert Hall has travelled to Tyrol in Austria to find out about one of the last battles of the Second World War. This is Itter, a village isolated from the hurly- burly of the world below, but for a few violent hours in 1945, the war intervened. Among the images of Itter’s ancient castle in the village archive, two photos from the years when it became a high security prison. Over the years, the Germans concentrated what they called honour prisoners, people who were potentially too important to mistreat, in various places around the Reich. Castle Itter was one of those places. Those hostages included two former French prime ministers and two captured army commanders. The final orders were clear. If the prisoners were of no use as a bargaining chip with Allied forces, they were to be executed. As the Allied armies got closer, the castle’s guards fled, but there was still a real danger from bands of die-hard SS troops roaming the forests, so a member of staff, a Czech, decided to go for help. Five miles down the valley, he found this man, Sepp Gangl, a veteran German officer now working with the Austrian resistance. He persuaded the nearest GIs to mount a rescue. He led their commander, jack Lee, with a handful of men and one tank, to the castle. Within hours they were surrounded and under attack from the SS. Though outnumbered, the Gls, Germans and elderly prisoners managed to hold out for 12 hours until an American relief column got through. TRANSLATION: The tank was still burning with smoke coming out. Hundreds of SS men were taken prisoner. Only one person lost their life inside. Sepp Gangl would not return to his wife and young son. A tiny but unique operation had saved men who had shaped France’s postwar future, and Itter could return to obscurity, an unknown village in a glorious landscape. Robert Hall, BBC News, Austria. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Alex Deakin. Warming upa Warming up a little over the next few days. Before then, the weather more mixed, like today. We have had scenes like this in Cumbria, and some thunderstorms in the Midlands and Lincolnshire. Those showers are starting to fade. One or two will keep going through the evening across Northern Ireland and the North of Scotland. In the South, the cloud increases but it will keep temperatures up. Elsewhere, cold. In parts of northern England and through central Scotland, there will be some frost. Generally across northern Britain, a sunny start, with cloud increasing further south. Some showers across the South, but that should not last too long. The rain will eventually work into Wales, parts of north-west England and Northern Ireland. With the rain it will feel cool, but the south, we could get 18 Celsius. In northern Scotland, just single figures. The wind is still a feature during the evening, spiralling around an area of low pressure, which continues to bring a mixture for Saturday. Some sunshine, but bands of showers, too. Some of the showers will be heavy, possibly with thunder. Further west, temperatures creeping up. That process continues into Sunday. Some rain around on Sunday pushing into the far north-west, but elsewhere across the bulk of the UK, Sunday looks dry and bright, with hazy sunshine and temperatures into the high teens, maybe 20 Celsius. We could go higher than that into next week, with warm air coming from Spain and Portugal. By Tuesday, for some, the mid-20s is possible. Now we join the BBC’s news teams where you are. Tonight on BBC London. Denied their right to vote - we follow the people turned away from the ballot box in East London. It is so frustrating. It should not be this difficult to vote. It is such a simple process. The council says the problem is due to an IT glitch. Also tonight: The two men who died after their stairlifts snapped in what’s been described as a ""catastrophic failure"". Brentford get ready to play in the Premier League - but do they have what it takes to win promotion? ~ .70 . 70 years on from .70 years on from VE Day, London remembers. I will tell you about all the celebrations planned across the capital. And we will meet the amazing Battle of Britain pilot who were shot down in flames over Essex. There was only one thing to do, and that was get out as fast as possible. Good evening, I’m Asad Ahmad. As the nation goes to the polls, with party leaders having fought for every vote, some Londoners have been stopped from having their say in the polling booth. The problem is in Hackney, where dozens of people found their name wasn’t on the councils printed register as it should have been. The local authority blames the problem on an ""IT glitch"", but it’s left residents understandably frustrated. Emma North has been finding out. We’re being told this year more than ever every vote counts. But for dozens of people in Hackney, simply casting their ballot was at best difficult, at worst impossible. Leone registered online injanuary but when she heard nothing from the council she followed it up. She claims she was ignored. She has come to the polling booth to try her luck. They said I was not on the list and would have to go to Hackney Town Hall to take it up with them, and that’s what I have to do, go to the town hall. Off she went. One voter compared it to trying to get into a nightclub. There are queues of tens of people trying to get served, Staff don’t have any idea. They are running around, shouting at each other. There are a lot of people who are angry and frustrated, understandably so. Steph Wilson was turned away once, but succeeded after a battle. They said there were administration issues with authentication, even though I have been voting and been able to vote for the last 20 years. I’m amazed there is an issue now. I think it is something to do with the new system that is in place this time. The Electoral Commission says it is aware of what is happening in Hackney and says difficulties are down to a problem with the IT system. They are advising people who have been unable to vote to get in touch with Hackney Council straightaway. In the meantime, how do difficulties like this affect the validity of a poll? It all depends on the majority. If you have an election won by a large majority then the votes of 50 or 100 people are not going to make any difference to the result. But when an election was down to the wire and there are 100 people who have not been able to vote but the margin of victory is only 50 votes, the legal system empowers the court to step in, investigate what has gone wrong and overturn the result if need be. For those who are turned away, they have until 10pm tonight to try again. The people who give up, legal experts say they may have a case under the Human Rights Act but will have lost their chance to vote. The company behind a stairlift which snapped on two separate occasions, both times killing the elderly users, has said it’s ""distraught and devastated"" at the deaths. One of the accidents happened in south London. The other was in Kent. An inquest in the deaths is taking place in Westminster, from where Helen Drew reports. George Bath maker and james Bell were both 79 when they died when their stair lifts broke while they were using them. Mr Bell died of a serious chest injury. In a separate incident, the other man died in the same year. Same year. It same year. It is appalling. This chairlift was put in to prevent an accident, and it proved to be the death of him. It was an emotional day for the families, waiting to hear the details. We just wantjustice. details. We just want justice. We want to prevent this ever happening again. The chairs were made by Acorn who make personalised chairlifts like these. In both cases, the welding failed. The inquest heard engineers say that the design of the Welch was fit for purpose, but the welds themselves, imported from Taiwan, were not properly made. The coroner described this as a catastrophic failure. She returned verdicts of death by accident from both men. Acorn have extended their sympathies to the families and have acted to make sure this kind of incident does not happen again. They say since these tragic deaths have been no further incidents. The families hope no one ever has to go through what they have. How much do you miss your partner? Terribly. I still wait for him to come through the door. And it is nearly two years. The families are pleased that Acorn has taken full responsibility for what has happened. A man who claims he was kept as a slave by a doctor and his wife for more than two decades has told a court how his passport was taken from him. Ofonime Inuk says he was held captive by Emmanuel and Antan Edet at their home in Perivale. He says he was told that if he left the house and contacted police, he would be arrested as an illegal immigrant and sent back to Nigeria. The couple deny charges of slavery and trafficking. Men have been charged with the murder of a pilot. The Men have been charged with the murder ofa pilot.

But when an election was down to the wire and there are 100 people who have not been able to vote but the margin of victory is only 50 votes, the legal system empowers the court to step in, investigate what has gone wrong and overturn the result if need be. For those who are turned away, they have until 10pm tonight to try again. The people who give up, legal experts say they may have a case under the Human Rights Act but will have lost their chance to vote. The company behind a stairlift which snapped on two separate occasions, both times killing the elderly users, has said it’s ""distraught and devastated"" at the deaths. One of the accidents happened in south London. The other was in Kent. An inquest in the deaths is taking place in Westminster, from where Helen Drew reports. George Bath maker and james Bell were both 79 when they died when their stair lifts broke while they were using them. Mr Bell died of a serious chest injury. In a separate incident, the other man died in the same year. Same year. It same year. It is appalling. This chairlift was put in to prevent an accident, and it proved to be the death of him. It was an emotional day for the families, waiting to hear the details. We just wantjustice. details. We just want justice. We want to prevent this ever happening again. The chairs were made by Acorn who make personalised chairlifts like these. In both cases, the welding failed. The inquest heard engineers say that the design of the Welch was fit for purpose, but the welds themselves, imported from Taiwan, were not properly made. The coroner described this as a catastrophic failure. She returned verdicts of death by accident from both men. Acorn have extended their sympathies to the families and have acted to make sure this kind of incident does not happen again. They say since these tragic deaths have been no further incidents. The families hope no one ever has to go through what they have. How much do you miss your partner? Terribly. I still wait for him to come through the door. And it is nearly two years. The families are pleased that Acorn has taken full responsibility for what has happened. A man who claims he was kept as a slave by a doctor and his wife for more than two decades has told a court how his passport was taken from him. Ofonime Inuk says he was held captive by Emmanuel and Antan Edet at their home in Perivale. He says he was told that if he left the house and contacted police, he would be arrested as an illegal immigrant and sent back to Nigeria. The couple deny charges of slavery and trafficking. Men have been charged with the murder of a pilot. The Men have been charged with the murder ofa pilot. The men, who are all bouncers, will appear at the magistrates court later in the year. 180 birds have been seized and a cannabis factory discovered after police raided a bird sanctuary in Berkshire. Police said the birds were being removed from Raven Haven in Crowthorne because of concerns over their welfare. Some birds have already been put down, while two men have been arrested on suspicion of producing a Class B drug. More now on Germany signing its unconditional surrender 70 years ago, bringing an end to the Second World War. Not surprisingly, London took centre stage for Victory in Europe Day celebrations, with the Queen and her sister, Princess Margaret, going undercover tojoin in, too. It all revolved around Trafalgar Square, from where we can join Sarah Harris. This is still where people come to celebrate, and 70 years ago things were no different. On VE Day, victory in Europe Day, the date when it was official that war against Germany was over. Dog into people who were there and experience that day, they talk about their feelings and what it meant, and the same words, overand and what it meant, and the same words, over and over again, joy and relief. Everyone was laughing and crying and waving flags and dancing and singing. joy is reading from her diary entry made 70 years ago when she was working in the War Cabinet office. She had to be persuaded to take the day off when her boss, Winston Churchill, announced the Nazis had been defeated. It took some time for it to sink in before she joined her family in Trafalgar Square. The whole thing felt so funny because suddenly there was no blackout. Suddenly the fear had gone. And it was almost incredulous, you couldn’t quite... I suppose in wartime the thing is so incessant, itjust goes on and on and on and nobody gives up and nobody stops. Sardines have nothing on the crowds in Trafalgar and Piccadilly! People were laughing and shouting and dancing congas. It was all kind of... Well, it was unbelievable, really. There was a massive change, just like that, in one day, with one word. For children, many of whom have known nothing else than war, this day must have seemed like an entry into Never-never Land. Victory bells rang out at Saint Pauls as crowds gathered on the Mall and Trafalgar Square. Gladys heard the news with her family at home in Westminster where they were getting ready to celebrate. We were going to have a meal, and we had a great big roar of an engine, and we thought, ""what on earth is that?"" We said, ""it can’t be the Germans because the war is over,"" and all of a sudden we looked out the window, and we saw a Spitfire, and he was doing the victory look. And he was so fast. We went, ""no wonder we won the war!"" These memories have been recorded for a special project at the Imperial War Museum. john Harrison’sjob during the war was to repair guns on battleships, but not on this day. When we heard the news, we looked at the few guns remaining and said, ""redundant, let’s go down the pub."" We went down the pub and had a drink, celebrated with everybody else. Such a lovely, relaxed atmosphere. It really was delightful. john is 101 years old, and still get emotional thinking back to the day. There is plenty to celebrate in London over the next few days. It starts at the Cenotaph tomorrow on the 8th of May, VE Day, there will be a short service, and then there will be a two-minute silence, it is all that will be observed all over the country. And then 200 beacons are being let across the UK, the first will be led by her Majesty the Queen at Windsor. On Saturday the British Legion concert will be broadcast on BBC One, and on Sunday will be a special service at Westminster Abbey, again attended by the Queen and will be a parade and street parties. Let’s bring in the colonel who is helping to organise many of these events. Why is it so important to remember something that happened 70 years ago? It was a momentous event. It is the 70th anniversary of the announcement by Winston Churchill of the end of almost six years of terrible war in Europe. Oui, make the courage, sacrifice and determination of all the people brought us through those dark days, with a baby military on operations or indeed the huge numbers of civilian population who suffered. I think we remember the fallen, and we celebrate the efforts of the population who came through. And the beacons reflecting what happened then and in years to follow? In this country we like beacons at every major event, jubilees and coronations, and beacons well it on the 50th anniversary in 1995, and communities are being invited to like them again tomorrow. Over 200 have answered the call. From 930, communities will like the beacons and commemorate. I’m told that the leaders of all the political parties will be there at the Cenotaph, come what may. And there’ll be more VE day stories later on the programme when we meet the 97-year-old Battle of Britain pilot whose plane was shot down in flames over Essex. Now it’s time for the sport with Sara. And there are still football matches to keep an eye on? Thank you. The Football League season concluded at the weekend, so now comes the drama of the play-offs. Brentford have had more than their fair share of bad luck at this stage over the years. They’re hoping they can change that as they take on Middlesbrough in the first leg of the semifinals tomorrow with a place in the Premier League at stake. Chris Slegg reports. Brentford are in the play-offs! The scenes last Saturday has Brentford sneaked into the play-offs, and now the Premier League is within touching distance. It is that close. Three weeks ago when it looked like we might drop out of the play-offs, we knew we were still going to make it. I think of thing happens for a reason and we are going to get promoted. Brentford’s stadium feels like a world away from the glamour of English football’s elite. The last time crowds here saw their team play in the top division was 1947, and football has changed somewhat since then. Brentford are three games away from a place in the Premier League is worth an estimated £120 million. If they go up, the Premier League may rule that Griffin Park cannot stage matches. Brentford have an agreement in place with an unnamed club to ground share in that event. Wherever they play, for the fans it feels like a dream. It is mouthwatering, is it really happening to us? We have wanted this for so many years. For manager Mark Warburton success will be bittersweet. In February the club announced he will leave this summer in part of what they are calling a remodelling. You have to respect the board have made a decision. We respect that. The club is in good hands under his leadership, and I’m sure they will go forward from here. Brentford have been beaten in all seven of their previous play-off campaigns. To beat that curse they need to be Middlesbrough over two legs and Norwich or Ipswich in the final Wembley. Then a place in the Premier League will be various. -- it will be there as. And you can hear live commentary of that match tomorrow night. Brentford against Middlesbrough in the 1st leg of the Championship play-off semi-final is on BBC London 94.9. Kick off is at 7.45. The former Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea strikerjimmy Greaves is out of intensive care. The 75-year-old was admitted to hospital on Sunday after suffering a severe stroke. His family has said he is now able to sit up in bed and that there is room for ""cautious optimism"". Olympic super heavyweight boxing champion Anthonyjoshua will be aiming to make it 12 wins from his first 12 fights as a professional on Saturday. The 25-year-old from Watford takes on Raphael Zumbano-Love in Birmingham. It’s part of a busy schedule forjoshua who fights again in just three weeks time against American Kevin johnson. I don’t actually have a life right now, it is just training and waiting to fight, and when I am not training I am resting. It is pretty basic, but I’m trying to learn my craft and become great at my craft. I know it is not going to be forever so I’m going to make the most of it while I’m here. Now, the month of May is always stuffed with sporting finals, but on Sunday it’s the turn of basketball. 17,000 fans are expected to descend on the O2 Arena as the reigning BBL Champions the Newcastle Eagles face the London Lions. This morning I was invited down into the Lions’ den on the Olympic Park ahead of the biggest match of their season. The London 2012 men’s Olympic basketball final. It was at the O2 and saw the United States win their gold medal in spectacular style. just four seconds on the clock, wants to take the three, and hits it! That atmosphere is hoping to be recreated this Sunday for the final between reigning champions Newcastle Eagles and the London Lions. The capital side are hoping to cash in on home support. Being a London boy, we want all the London fans to support us and make a lot of noise and be behind us for the whole game. I want everything, I want chants, cheers, noise, drums, everything you can bring- pots and pans, just smack them with spatulas. The squad are delighted we are in a big final, the biggest in basketball history in this country. At the O2 arena, over 17,000 people, it will be a real challenge. But for us from London, it is exactly what we wanted. The Lions’ history has been somewhat nomadic, they have played in sports centres, shopping centres, disused warehouses, and have even considered playing in a tent. It is thanks to the commitment of their coach they now call the Copper Box home. After the Olympics I made some enquiries because we lost our home in Milton Keynes where we used to play, so I wondered if they would like a basketball team here, and they more or less bit my arm off. Coming here seems fitting. If you are going to have a basketball team in London, it needs to be the best and play in the best venue, and I think we are. It was during their days in Milton Keynes they made their last final appearance. Although the Copper Box is now where the Lions are tamed, the O2 is not a bad swap. It is our second home. just hope we get a lot of London support and London love, and we hold down for the city. Back to you, Asad. Today, the actor and film director Orson Welles would have celebrated his 100th birthday. To mark the life and work of the man behind what’s often regarded by critics as the greatest film ever made, the British Film Institute is celebrating his talent and link to London. Here’s our Arts Correspondent, Brenda Emmanus. This is the stage door of the Hackney Empire, last of the great variety theatres in the London area. The late, great Orson Welles on a walkabout in Hackney, taken from his 1950s miniseries of rarely seen television programmes, which form part of a two-month season at the British Film Institute showcasing the work of this titan of cinema 100 years after his birth. Orson Welles was a great innovator and artist who made work which was rich and profound, many unfinished. This two-month season at the BFI includes classics and rarities from one of cinema’s revolutionaries. This silent comedy, Too Muchjohnson, is a newly unearthed work by Welles, shot when he was 23 years old. We know him quite rightly for about a dozen fantastic feature films, and then there is all the work he did later in his career when he continued being experimental, being bold, doing new things, trying to get things done, a lot of which never ended up on the screens to the public. Every independent poll shows that I will be elected! His first feature film, Citizen Kane, is regarded as one of the best movies of all time, but his biographer, actor Simon Callow, believes his legacy stretches beyond those famous films. His appetite for the media in which he worked, whether radio, theatre or film, was just overwhelming. He was brilliant intellectually, he was extraordinarily imaginative, he had amazing flair, and above all he wanted to push every medium that he worked in to its limits. Actor, writer, producer and director, he was a man renowned for flouting conventions, and from july there is a chance to explore the work that established this reputation. Back now to VE day celebrations planned for the next few days, and among them is a very special one in a village in Essex. It’s where a Battle of Britain pilot fell out of the sky and onto the villagers’ doorstep. Our reporter Shaun Peel has been to Menorca to meet the Hurricane pilot and listen to his incredible story. Maurice Mounsdon is 97 and has lived in three minute of it. -- lived every minute. Born in 1918 at the end of the First World War, he went on to become a hero of the Second, one of the last Battle of Britain pilots. I’d had a shot at one of the bombers, and I was overtaking the squadron, so I turned to come back and have another go, when I was hit. Maurice flew Hurricanes out of North Weald in Essex, a fearless 22-year-old taking on the Germans almost daily. His logbook is a record of Battles of Britain fought and won. But on August 31 he was shot into flames over Colchester, and Maurice burned in the cockpit. I was hit with a cannon shell in the petrol tank behind the dashboard. Which exploded, of course, and it blew petrol into the cockpit, which instantly caught fire. There was only one thing to do, and that was get out as fast as possible. As his parachute carried him over the church, his Hurricaine flew out of control, scattering bullets onto the village as the locals took cover. As it had gone round and round, bullets had been firing and they had gone in that wall, so there are holes in the wall. And a bit further down there was this other house and she had tomatoes on a windowsill in the front, and it shot all the tomatoes and squashed them all. Maurice landed in a field just behind where the village hall now stands. He was found by a welcoming committee who tracked his descent. He had terrible burns. I think it was something like a scene from Dad’s Army, because they came up here with the intent of roughing him up, thinking he was a German, pitchforks and suchlike at hand to try and sort out this possible prisoner of war. As it turned out, he was friend and not foe. His flying helmet was recovered and now lives in the museum at North Weald. Maurice was taken in by the villagers, where his burns were treated by a local nurse until he could be transferred to hospital. There was no question. You either stayed in the aircraft and you were dead, or you got out with a chance of staying alive. You must have been in terrible pain. No, not terrible pain, but acute discomfort. The pain comes later. Oh, yes. Burns are rather uncomfortable. Maurice retired here 35 years ago, but he will never forget that Saturday morning in 1940. There is a film to be made of his story, an incredible man. Helen, we are hearing so much about VE Day, and the parties, what was the weather like 70 years ago? Thunderstorms were the forecast, and of course people did not know, because the weather charts were not available to the general public through the war years because they thought it might compromise the Allied position. Although it hasn’t been as warm today, we have had some slightly better weather. But look what is creeping in from the south. It is a change of weather. We have had a couple of days of showers, we have a cool evening and night to come, but the cloud coming in will blanket the following temperature. Near the south coast it will turn damp and misty. It will be chilly in the North overnight. Tomorrow it looks as if it should stay mainly dry, but unlike today it will tend to cloud over, and through the afternoon the cloud will thicken. As it does we will see misty and murky conditions, some hill fog over the diamonds, and patchy rain into the afternoon. Temperatures will be on a par with today, 17 or 18 Celsius. Evening and overnight tomorrow we may catch some showers, they will be milder on Friday night into Saturday and quite misty and murky. Saturday will be showery initially with brisk wind is picking up. Some heavy showers and could be some thunder. As we get towards Sunday we clear the cloud out the way, but there will be some big showers in the afternoon. Into Sunday we pick up southerly winds and high pressure. A cold night Saturday into Sunday. We could see some frost. The high-pressure indicate we should have some drier and warmer weather on Sunday and into next week. Before we go, a reminder of this evening’s main news headlines. Millions of people are voting in the general election. Polling stations are open for another three hours. The first results are expected at around midnight. But in Hackney, some residents have struggled to vote at all, because of a computer glitch at the council. 50 people hadn’t been registered despite meeting the deadline. And events to mark the 70th anniversary of VE day will take place from tomorrow and over the weekend. That’s it for now. I’ll be back with an election round-up early tomorrow morning from 6.30 on BBC One and the News Channel, giving you a picture of results from in and around London. I hope you canjoin me tomorrow morning. Goodbye for now. SNAP! WATER CHURNS Good evening and welcome to The One Show with Alex jones. And Matt Ba ker. Election day is finally upon us and there are just under three hours until the polls close. At 9.55 the BBC coverage will begin. You may be getting ready for an all-night election party. We are hosting a very different party. A birthday party, in fact, to celebrate 30 years of another very important institution.

No. I shall watch it as long as I can and then I will have to go to bed because I have got to shave tomorrow! The reason we all get a vote is partly thanks to a treaty signed 800 years ago. A treaty that for some people may help them keep their homes. Written in the 13th century. Magna Carta is a keystone of modern democracy. Next month, the Queen will be joining celebrations to mark its 800th anniversary. But a ",,

My father came back from the war as a superstar. We were free. To mark one of the most important days in British history... Less than a week to go and the parties clarify their red lines over who they would and wouldn’t work with in government. Ed Miliband says there is no question of any deal with the Scottish National Party, even if that decision keeps Labour out of government. I made clear last night that I am not going to have a Labour government based on a deal or coalition with the Scottish National Party. David Cameron says he will only deal with a party that agrees to an EU referendum but says he’s fighting for a majority. ~ I think it is perfectly fair want to do that again.

Plus, what does the bank holiday weekend weather have in store? Your local and national forecast is coming up. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, has once again insisted that he wouldn’t do a deal with the SNP to form a government. Speaking while out campaigning this morning, he said he wasn’t willing to ""pay that price"" to get into government. The other leaders have also set out their so-called red lines for any post-election deals. David Cameron said any coalition including the Conservatives would have to accept a referendum on Britain’s EU membership. Nick Clegg insisted that a coalition involving the Liberal Democrats would have to stick to his party’s proposals for increased education spending. Our political correspondent, Sean Curran reports. Last night was hard on all of them. David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg faced tough questions in one of the big television events of the election campaign. Ed Miliband the SNP -- on track to be the Prime Minister. I made clear I will not have a Labour government based on a deal or coalition with the SNP. The SNP says Labour will have to work with other parties to get its policies through. If Ed Miliband is really saying he would rather have a Tory government ban work with the SNP for more progressive politics, it is final proof Labour have lost the plot. This is a career defining election. This is a country defining election. Was that a Freudian slip? He called on voters to act decisively. I think it is fair to say, I have done coalition, we made it work, we have a good record. I have got the T-shirt. I do not want to do it again. I think Britain would do better with a stronger and more accountable government. Both David Cameron and Ed Miliband want to walk through the door with enough MPs to win every Commons vote. As the campaign has gone on, they have been pressed to explain what might happen if the outcome is a little less clear. What could be the deal breakers in any post-election talks? Labour says there will not be a former-- formal Labour says there will not be a former -- formal coalition with the SNP. The Liberal Democrats have several red lines. The Conservatives say there must be a referendum on the EU. Don’t trust any of them. They tell us one thing and do the opposite. People have to put trust in these people. They are hard-working. There is too much media spin and too much on personalities. The figures they gave do not make sense. The Lib Dem leader hopes his red lines will be persuasive. We will not go into a government which does not protect money going into the NHS and nurseries, schools and colleges. Ukip says it will not join any formal coalition. I want us to have a full referendum to decide whether we are members of a political in -- political union in Europe. The politicians only have a few more days to win the trust of voters. Sean Curran, BBC News, Westminster. Our Scotland correspondent is in Dundee. What reaction there? This is a risky strategy for Ed Miliband. On the one hand, it reinforces his party’s message north of the border that they have been peddling for weeks that a vote for the SNP will help the Conservatives form a majority and lesson Labour’s majority in Westminster. That strategy might help with slithering Labour voters who fear a Conservative government. The risk is this. The strategy does not appear to have worked so far. The polls do not look to have shifted. If Ed Miliband is saying he would rather hand the keys of Number Io Downing St to David Cameron than work with the party they may have voted for, thatis the party they may have voted for, that is a risk. Nicola Sturgeon said todayit that is a risk. Nicola Sturgeon said today it is a risk Scotland would never forgive today it is a risk Scotland would neverforgive him for. This today it is a risk Scotland would never forgive him for. This time next week we will know the result and what deals need to be done. Thank you. The audience last night was keen to find out where the party leaders would be willing to compromise if nobody gets a majority. How likely is that? Christian Fraser has some numbers at the campaign hub. Well, it is enormously difficult predicting the number of seats a party might take. Some academics do have had a go it. This one from Election Forecast. Bear in mind, these numbers are within a significant margin of error. But let’s imagine for a second this is the picture on 8th May. The Prime Minister, as the incumbent, gets the opportunity to go first. The Conservatives, on these figures, the biggest party with 280, but a long way short of the line for a parliamentary majority. So perhaps they invite the Liberal Democrats over, coalition as was. Maybe there is a deal with the right-leaning DUP of Northern Ireland in a confidence and supply arrangement where they back the Government in any vote that might bring them down. Bear in mind the number, 315, still short of the line, but perhaps the Prime Minister tries to force through his legislated programme with this number of seats. Who on the left might vote against it? Well, Labour of course. But we also know Nicola Sturgeon has made it clear the SNP would vote against it also. Look what happens, 317 plays 315. The right-wing government would collapse and suddenly Ed Miliband gets an opportunity. He has ruled out that coalition formally. So perhaps then he tries to tempt over the Liberal Democrats. Perhaps there is a formal coalition, maybe there is an agreement with the left-leaning SDLP, Plaid Cymru, maybe even the Greens. Still short of the line, but 303 is more than the Conservatives would be able to pull together. And as long as the SNP doesn’t vote against Labour to try and bring this coalition down, then Ed Miliband could be Prime Minister. The important thing to say is, when you look at each stack, if you put another ten seats on the right-wing stack, for instance, it would make a big difference. Lots to play for in the final week and both men are saying they are still fighting for a majority. Our assistant political editor, Norman Smith, is in Leeds. It was called BBC question could have been Deal or politicians are having to sketch the deals they would do and those they wouldn’t. After weeks of campaigning, the shifted and we appear to be heading towards the hung parliament. You sensed growing public impatience. We saw it last night in the event in Leeds where the no-nonsense Yorkshire audience gave the politicians a pummelling particularly over what sort of compromises they would be prepared to make. David Cameron today talking to staff at Asda said, I have done coalition, got the T-shirt, don’t want to do it again. Ed Miliband reiterated not going to do anything with the SNP, even if that means he cannot form a government. Nigel Farage, I will never work with Ed Miliband. Plaid Cymru, don’t want coalitions will stop do not allow your head to be scrambled by red lines, coalition, yes, coalition, no. The central fact is this. The polls and public pressure of forcing the politicians to sketch out the parameters of the deals they would do and those they would not do. As you say, deal or no Deal? More on the election later in the programme. Remember, you can keep up to date with all the election coverage at the BBC Election Live webpage, that’s at bbc.co.uk/electionlive. The Nepalese government says it’s still struggling to cope six days after the devastating earthquake. It’s appealed for more helicopters to be sent by foreign governments as relief teams’ efforts to reach remote villages continue. The number of people known to have died now stands at 6,200. Our correspondent, Divya Arya, has been with a medical charity as they try to travel around the country to get aid to the victims. This is what a successful rescue mission looks like. But here in the aftermath of the massive earthquake, there have been accusations the government has failed to coordinate the response. Workers from a Polish charity spend days in the capital trying to find out where they were needed. There was chaos when we arrived. But after two days, we got information from the Ministry of health, from the Korda nation centre. You have to do some investigation to get the information. Eventually they decided to head north on their own. They met victims of the quake on the way who say they have received no help so far. The Polish team set up a mobile clinic in a matter of minutes. Within hours, they are back on the road. As we go on, the devastation becomes more evident. Entire villages destroyed. This town has been lucky because many people have been evacuated, airlifted by helicopter sent by different countries. But the mountain is dotted with towns and villages still waiting for help. The government told us they are sending doctors to where they are needed the most. But clearly the resources are not getting to people fast enough. This man says he waited for a doctor for his injured wife for four days before carrying her to the hilltop. For her, help has finally arrived. But there are still thousands more who are desperately in need of medical aid and are yet to receive any. New video has emerged showing the moment a woman from Britain got caught up in and survived the earthquake and avalanches on Mount Everest. 22-year-old Annie Tinsley, from Devon, was on the trip of a lifetime in Nepal and she was half an hour from Everest Base Camp when the avalanche hit. She’s been talking exclusively to the BBC about her experience. jon Kay reports. What do we do? It was meant to be her 21st birthday adventure. But this was not the holiday film Annie expected to make. Running for her life, just a mile from Everest base camp. An avalanche triggered by the Nepalese earthquake. Remarkably, Annie and her party escaped with minor injuries and returned to Kathmandu to reflect on how lucky they have been. We were five minutes away from being on the Lassie. Then there would have been nothing to hold onto -- there would have been nothing to hold onto -- the glazier. We met others the other side of the glazier and they said it was the worst experience of their lives because they could not hold onto anything. We had the opportunity to run up and down under rocks. Especially with all of the devastation it has caused here, we were lucky to be far enough from the epicentre that it was not as big as it could have been. Wow. Incredible to record that. Back home in Devon, we showed Annie’s video to her dad. It is the first time he has seen the reality of what she has been through. What is it like as a dad? I am very proud of her and the way she reacted, not only for herself but looking after the others as well. That is typical of Annie. She is really caring and an adventurer. Tough for you to watch? Absolutely. As a parent, it is very tough to watch and the emotions we have been through certainly for the first few hours when we heard about the and the earthquake, absolutely... Very worrying. supporters at the 1989 Hillsborough disaster have been hearing more evidence from the former police chief, Sir Norman Bettison. Our correspondent, judith Moritz, is in Warrington. You will remember in 1989 Mr Bettison was a chief inspector. He has give p evidence today for a second day. He was asked about an allegation made earlier in these inquests, that there was a meeting held by the police two days after the disaster. It was run by Terry Wane. He reportedly at that meeting said the blame would be placed where it belonged, on drunked, ticketless supporters. Today, Norman Bettison denied that and being at that meeting. He also denied being part of an effort to furnish MPs with material to advance a particular case for South Yorkshire Police, to Parliament. Now, he’s continuing to be questioned today and we also understand that Sir Norman Bettison will be back here in court to be questioned into next week as well. Thank you very much. Our top story this lunchtime: Less than a week to go until the election and the parties clarify their ‘red lines’ over who they would and who they wouldn’t work with in Government. And still to come: A turbulent time ahead - as windfarms prove a divisive issue in the countryside. The sport at half past, cycling’s first ever Tour de Yorkshire is under way. The race includes a brand new team, run by Sir Bradley Wiggins. It’s a bold claim - a new battery for the home that could help change the ""entire energy infrastructure of the world"". But that’s how the boss of American electric car manufacturer Tesla Motors describes this - a battery charged by solar panels that doesn’t rely on a National Grid. The product’s launch was aimed at a global market. This type of technology is seen as critical to a more widespread adoption of ""clean"" energy sources like solar and wind. Our business correspondent, john Moylan, reports. It is the must-have electric car for the rich and famous. Could the technology behind Tesla Cars transform how we power our homes? At a glitzsy launch at the US last night, the company unveiled its latest big idea - last night, the company unveiled its latest big idea - a home battery which its billionaire founder claims will revolutionise green energy. You can actually go, if you want, completely off-grid. You can take your solar panels, charge the battery packs and that is all you use. So, it gives you safety, security. And it gives you a complete and affordable solution. If that sounds too futuristic, well, think again. This house in West London is already taking part in a trial to work out whether we could all have batteries in our homes. So, where do you keep the battery? The storage system is around here. Peter has had solar panels for year. He can now get the benefit 24 hours a day. These two panels here hide the batteries and they take electricity from the solar panels up on our roof during the day time when the sun is shining. They get charged up. After the sunsets in the evening, we can take electricity back from these and use it. So, basically it is a way to have solar after the sun has set. Peteris have solar after the sun has set. Peter is part of a Government trial. He didn’t pay for his battery. He’s yet to decide whether the sums add up. Experts say it will be crucial if Tesla’s version is to take off. The only people who will buy it - this is paying $3,000 to pai three worth of technology. Tesla thinks millions will be keen. It could give a lot of money to them and a huge jolt to the energy world. A report intojimmy Savile and Stuart Hall has been delayed at the request of the police. The Metropolitan force says it is concerned releasing the findings could prejudice its on-going investigation. The report compelled after the investigation interviewed 375 witnesses in connection with Savile and hundreds about Hall was due to be published this month. A 47-year-old man busy pleaded guilty to starting a fire which destroyed buildings. He admitted four counts of arson at Oxford Crown Court. He set the fires within a few minutes of each other in january using gas cylinders. A Prosecutors have appealed for calm. The results of the police investigation have been released. Officers admitted there was a previously undisclosed stop made by the police van as it took to 25-year-old to jail. A volcano in southern Chile has erupted for the third time in eight days prompting the evacuation of more than 2,000 people. Some residents had onlyjust returned to their homes after last week’s eruptions. The Calbuco volcano erupted twice last week after lying dormant for four decades. The latest blast was less powerful, but sent a huge cloud of ash and smoke into the air threatening to blanket farms and villages all over again. More now on the election, and all this week we’re with the party leaders as they campaign across the country. Today, it’s the turn of Labour leader Ed Miliband. Our political correspondent, Iain Watson, has been on the election trail with him. It looks great on television, a confident leader striding through the crowds. A spontaneous soapbox moment, rallying the troops. But is there rather less to this campaign than meets the eye? Ed Miliband’s speech here in North London lasted less than five minutes. He wasn’t hounded by opponents. There wasn’t much time for them to cotton on he was in town. The crowd consisted of activists and MPs, and that’s not been untypical of the campaign. It’s breakfast in Stevenage. Party members are coming here, signing in overthere, picking up their badges, and they obviously start some of the members very young here. Now, it isn’t so much Ed Miliband coming here to meet undecided voters. These, I think, are very decided voters from what I’m seeing here. They are all party activists, but what he intends to do is come to this room, address them forjust a few minutes, but then encourage them to go out canvassing, in the pouring rain, to try to win one of the key marginal seats Labour will nedd if it wants to form a government. It’s only when working people succeed when Britain succeeds, that is what we are fighting for in this election and that is why we need a Labour Government. APPLAUSE Any reluctance to mingle with the public is both personal and political. You wouldn’t want to be seen alongside these Conservative activists who hang around outside some of his events. Idid say... Stand back. But in this short walkabout, in a Labour target seat in London, it turned into something of a scrum when he was mobbed by supporters, not opponents. In these days, personal safety of politicians is an issue. This may look like Labour’s campaign bus. It is similar but it’s not the same. It has lovely comfy seats, free Wi-Fi, and on this road trip you get snacks and supplies. But as you can see there is no Ed Miliband. The press is playing a game of follow the leader. He is often way ahead of ours on another boss, but we have one crucial advantage over him. The ability to take a comfort stop on board. Perhaps to counter accusations that the campaign is looking rather too controlled, thousands of local people, some of them quite sceptical, were invited along to this event on the Wirral. I think that the business community has got very little confidence in your Shadow Chancellor. We are the only party to say that every penny of what we promise is paid for with out extra borrowing. But sometimes things are even more unpredictable. From the heart-warming, to the heart stopping. And even when Ed Miliband really does want to meet the public, well, they don’t always respond. This election campaign has had little detail on the environment- perhaps surprising, considering how much passion the issue can stir. Our environment analyst, Roger Harrabin, has been looking at how the parties say they plan to tackle environmental issues in the countryside. Clean energy saviour or blot on the landscape? Wind farms are the cheapest source of readily available, low-carbon power. Labour, the Lib Dems and Greens want more. The Conservatives and Ukip say they are ruining the countryside. At this moor near Huddersfield, locals want to fund threure bieps to make their own -- to fund threure bieps to make their own -- fund Three Turbines to make their own energy. They will effectively knock all on-shore wind on the head because they say they will withdraw all subsidy levels now. Some people may not like the idea of subsidy for renewable energy. But on-shore wind is the cheapest renewable energy. It is cheaper than off-shore. Across the Pennines the moors stretch nearly to the Manchester conurbation. Greenbelt here is dog-walker heaven. Here is another threat - dog-walker heaven. Here is another threat - the house builders are moving in. Adding the courtyard of new homes here, on the edge of Bolton. . The greenbelt is supposed to stay here. We oppose the scheme because we felt there were other brownfield sites nearby. Yet, this is another example of greenbelt being released for housing. Now this has gone - being released for housing. Now this has gone - what will happen next time around? The Conservatives and Ukip pledge to keep all greenbelt. Labour, Lib Dems and Greens have not. It is a tricky one, this. We need more homes and privately some senior environmentalists admit there are scruffy areas of the greenbelt which could be built on. Even so, this is an issue which really infuriates local people. There are so many pressures on the countryside. The Conservatives have a huge and controversial programme for new roads, like this one on the edge of Hastings. Labourwill roads, like this one on the edge of Hastings. Labour will review some schemes, but only the Greens would scrap the whole programme. As the population grows, pressures on the countryside will grow too. Next week’s election may well be decided by voters in marginal constituencies, one of which is Loughborough, where the Education Secretary, Nicky Morgan, is fighting for her seat. She has a majority of 3,700 and the seat is a key target for Labour. It’s a result that will be watched closely. At every election since 1974, they have chosen an MP from the party that went on to win the most seats in the Commons. Phil Mackie has been to find out more. Six days to go. Behind every door is a potential voter. I want to say hello. I understand you have... There’s a most senior Conservative which Labour has in its sights on. No wonder Education Secretary, Nicky Morgan, is busy knocking on doors. The latest constituency polls suggest the Conservatives are slightly ahead in a two-horse race with Labour. But with five candidates, the choice could be confusing. And the campaigning is going to have to continue right the way until next Thursday when the ballots are open because so many people have not made their minds up yet and are unlikely to do so until the very last moment. Deciding who to vote for is so complicated because it’s notjust a sort of Conservative or a Labour - it’s all the other combinations of parties there might be. Have you made up your mind how you will vote yet? No. When do think you will make your mind up? On the evening, I guess. Really, on the day of the polling you will go out in the evening and vote? Yes. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen... This was the latest debate here earlier this week in which all five parties took part. When you think of Loughborough you automatically think of the university, and with at least 5,000 students registered to vote here in the town it’s become a really crucial political battleground for all of the candidates. It is interesting. The students are engaged regardless which party they are going with, just to follow it. I keep looking on the BBC News, wherever it may be, to see what each day politicians are saying. It is an interesting general election. Labour’s Matthew O’Callaghan is a former councillor, well used to traditional campaigning. This was a seat Labour held until 2010. And they think there’s still time to persuade the don’t knows and overturn a Tory majority of less than 4,000. But not every doorstep has a welcome mat and of course many have already made up their minds. Phil Mackie, BBC News, Loughborough. Tonight, on the News at Ten, we’ll be looking at another battleground constituency - Sheffield Hallam, currently held by the Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg. You’re watching the BBC News at One. It is coming up to 1. 30pm. Our top story: Today the Tories clarify the red line over who they would and who they wouldn’t work with in Government. In a moment, we’ll have the weather, plus the news where you are. But first, with the sport, here Huw Woosencroft. Big weekend of sport ahead, but we start with a new event on the cycling calendar which got under way this morning. It’s the Tour de Yorkshire and it’s a legacy from the Tour de France which visited the county for three stages last year. The Tour starts at Bridlington and it’s a debut event for a new team led by Sir Bradley Wiggins. Our reporter, Matt Slater, is there. Hello. About an hour and a half ago, the first-ever Tour de Yorkshire rolled out of Bridlington, 144 riders, set off up the road towards Scarborough. They are going on a detour through the North York Moors, coming back in through beautiful spots like Whitby. The picture was different and hour and a half ago. Hundreds of very noisy fans. Nobody was at school! My ears are still ringing. A great many of those people were here to see one man. Sir Bradley Wiggins. Multiple Olympic and world champion. I caught up with him just before the start and I asked him what he hopes to achieve this weekend, bearing in mind he has got a big day next month in London, so he is not going to be breaking any bones here. We hope. We have got some guys in the team, some youngsters, going to try to keep them up. For myself, this is preparation. I would like to stay safe and healthy and if I can come through this race and have a good work-out, I will be pleased. That was Sir Bradley Wiggins, very relaxed. He will get the most incredible reception, huge crowds are expected this weekend. Not as big as last summer. Remarkable scenes for the Tour de France when millions came out to watch the riders. Anyone involved that weekend is still talking about it, the riders included. The organisers of this new race that has got to find its feet are hoping for about 1 million. That will be plenty and I think they will see great riding as well. I can hear people beeping, they are packing everything up. I had better get to the finish in Scarborough. I will catch you later there. Much to look forward to in Yorkshire this weekend. To cricket now and all-rounder Ben Stokes is a doubt ahead of England’s third Test against the West Indies which starts this afternoon. England can’t lose the series, following last week’s victory in the second Test. Opening batsman Adam Lythe could feature, or England might go for an extra bowler in spinner Adil Rashid or fast bowler Liam Plunkett. Now, I cannot wait - the build-up is intensifying ahead of the world title ""Superfight"" between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao this weekend. The pairweigh in later this evening and are widely seen as the two greatest fighters of their generation. Mayweather is undefeated, while Pacquiao has a been a world champion in six different weight divisions. That’s all sport for now. Back to you. Nasa’s Messenger spacecraft has crashed into the surface of Mercury as planned, after running out of fuel. It spent four years orbiting the planet, detecting frozen water-covered poles and volcanic deposits. Messenger was completely destroyed in the crash - not surprising given it hit the surface at more than 8,000 miles-an-hour. Our science correspondent, Pallab Ghosh, reports. The planet Mercury, dwarfed by the Sun. The smallest planet in our solar system and for years it was thought to be a featureless rock. Not any more. just take a look at these pictures. The different colours show various chemicals. On the ground, there are Freddie features and possibly traces of carbon -- features and possibly traces of carbon -- craggy features. This image shows a chemical seemingly dancing above the surface. Best of all, the first map of its entire surface. The pictures were taken by Nasa’s Messenger spacecraft. Its mission has transformed our view of mercury. There were fairies about how it had formed. We measured the chemistry of the surface and all of the fairies were wrong. It is not just understanding how Mercury formed, but how all the planets formed. This is the last picture Messenger sent back. It ended its mission with a bang last night, crashing into Mercury at 8000 miles an hour. There is going to be another mission to Mercury launched in two years time to learn more. It has raised questions we can put to the next mission. The European and japanese mission will go there and get there in a decade. It will maybe answer some questions that Messenger has raised. What many thought to be the dullest planet in our solar system has turned out to be much more interesting and mysterious than astronomers had imagined. Time for a look at the weather. judging by the lovely satellite picture, the 1st of May is starting on a glorious note. But rather chilly. The sunshine is quite hazy and figure in the south-west producing outbreaks of rain. Cloud in the North and East. This afternoon is looking mostly dry. Good spells of sunshine. Hazy at times particularly in the south. A bit of a breeze as well in the north-east and southern counties towards south Wales, taking the edge off the temperatures. The south-west of England, looks like we will continue to see patchy rain, and then north of here, more cloud. For the Midlands, North East of England, the South, lots of sunshine. The odd shower possible in the afternoon for Northern Ireland and northern England. The focus of the showers will be across northern and eastern Scotland. Some of the showers will be wintry over higher ground. Lovely weather across western Scotland. The showers die away this evening. Overnight, northern and eastern areas will turn very cold under clear skies with light winds. The weather front will eventually reach Northern Ireland. More cloud, not quite as cold. A touch of frost across the North. Saturday starts on a cold but bright note across Scotland, northern and eastern England. Gradually, the cloud in the south and rain will advance north. Staying dry across northern and eastern areas all day. The rain will be heavy in southern and western areas. Temperature is starting to come up. Still chilly in the North and East. By Sunday, the rain will spread north to virtually all parts, may be transient snow on the higher ground of Scotland and breezy there too. Farther south, sunshine and showers. Feeling warm in the sunshine. Bank holiday Monday for most is looking good. This area of low pressure giving us a bit of a headache because we do not know how far north it will go. For the most part, we lose the rain in the north. Most places should be dry I’m feeling warm in the sunshine. In southern counties, rain arriving potentially later. A bit of uncertainty, keep tuned to the weather forecast. Nowa reminder of our top story this lunchtime. Less than a week to go until the election and the parties clarify their red lines over who they would and who they wouldn’t work with in government. Exclusive pictures of the moment an avalanche struck a British climber. There is not much you can do apart from run when you’re Nepalese guide says run. We followed and try to find shelter. Have a good afternoon Welcome to BBC London news. I’m Victoria Hollins. A teenager’s suffered what police are calling life-changing injuries after an attack in West London. He was stabbed in the stomach in Porchester Road in Paddington just after 4am this morning. No-one’s been arrested in connection with the attack. Meanwhile, the parents of Kiyan Prince, a schoolboy murdered outside his school in Edgware, have joined other families affected by violent youth crime in a vigil in Trafalgar Square. A minute’s silence was held to highlight the work of the charity One Minute in May which educates young people. Ayshea Buksh reports. ~ Iamjust in I am just in front of Downing Street and a large group has been here macro for an hour. The aim is to commemorate the people who have died from youth violence and to give their parents, friends and families they chanced to remember them. Many different youth groups here. The initiative has been led by the Cheyenne Prince foundation and his father and friends. -- Cheyenne Prince foundation and his fatherand friends. -- Kiyan Cheyenne Prince foundation and his father and friends. -- Kiyan Prints. You are not alone. Young people, you are not alone. We need to stop youth violence and regain it young people and the streets of the UK. It is getting out of hand. I have covered many ventures and there are many youth groups here. How will you do that? My motto is, we cannot work alone, we have to work as a team. If all of the organisations linked up, we can work as one. Football teams, when they are training, they train in different positions. When they play matches, they play as a team. We need to work as a team, all of the mentors, everyone who has been on the streets and understood what street life has been about and they have turned their lives around. We have to create awareness. Let us hope the initiative, One Minute in May, will become a regular feature and many groups will take one minute’s silence to remember those who have died. New talks are to be held to reach a pay deal for thousands of London Underground workers for the next two years. They’ll also discuss the introduction of a new all-night service. Workers are being offered a £500 payment for the introduction of weekend all-night Tubes which are due to start on some lines in September. The RMT union has described current talks as at stalemate. A huge new roof garden opens to the public in East London today. It’s more than 250m long, has tropical plants and walkways and will be open from dawn till dusk. It’s part of a seven-storey building at Canary Wharf which has shops, restaurants and a cinema and will also house the Crossrail station when the trains start running in three year’s time. In football, the Championship season reaches its conclusion this weekend and among those who still have plenty to play for are Brentford. If the Bees beat Wigan at Griffin Park tomorrow, and results elsewhere go their way, they will sneak into the play-offs. Manager Mark Warburton hopes his players can seize the moment. It isa It is a very important game on Saturday. No doubt. Would they rather this or be fighting relegation? Relish the opportunity, embrace the challenge, see how far you can go. Now a check on the bank holiday weekend weather. It is looking complicated. Something for everybody in the forecast. Today, not complicated, it is going to stay dry with lots of brightness, hazy sunshine at times. It is feeling cooler than yesterday. Top temperatures only 13, 14. Cooler on the coast with the wind from the East. Overnight, it will stay dry with cloud coming in from the West as we head towards dawn. Coldest in the north-eastern corner over parts of Essex. Tomorrow, the start of the ",,

With six days to go until the General Election, the party leaders fight it out over who will do a deal with whom. Ed Miliband again says no Coalition and no deal with the SNP. ~ I made clear last night that I’m not going to have a Labour government based on a deal or coalition with the Scottish National Party. If Ed Miliband is really saying he would rather have a Tory government than work with the SNP for more progressive politics, then its final proof that Labour has lost the plot. Meanwhile David Cameron says an EU referendum is a must for any deal with the Conservatives, although he’d rather govern alone. ~ I think it’s perfectly fair in the next six days to say, look, I’ve done coalition and we have made it work, I’ve got a good record and I got the T-shirt, but I don’t want to do that again. I think Britain would do better now with a strong, decisive and more accountable government. We’ll be asking whether the deals that might be struck after the election have become any clearer. Also tonight... Relief agencies in Nepal struggle to get help to remote areas, six days after the earthquake. Get town! New footage of the avalanche on Mount Everest as survivors tell their stories. A senior police officer tells the Hillsborough inquest he was wrong to say Liverpool fans’ behaviour made the job of the police harder.

And a minute’s silence - as Londoners gather in Downing Street to remember young victims of gun and knife crime. an abandoned baby boy whose body was found in Edinburgh two years ago. Good evening. The election campaign stepped up a gear today, with the party leaders criss-crossing the country as a debate raged over who would do a deal with whom to form the next government. David Cameron said the prospect of a Labour government propped up by the SNP was as real as ever, despite Ed Miliband again ruling out any such agreement today. The SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said that Labour had ""lost the plot"" and that voters would be appalled. Our correspondent Lucy Manning reports. And early start after a long, hard night before. Ed Miliband heading to England, Wales and Scotland, the last leg where the election could hang. Good morning. On the train to Cardiff but Scottish issues dominating, his words last night that he would rather not being government than do a deal with the SNP. The SNP and Nicola Sturgeon say it sounds like you would rather work with a Tory government than the SNP, do you? Not at all. I’ve made clear last night that I would not have a Labour government that made a deal with the Scottish National Party. I want to make it clear on this, I have no truck with the SNP as a political party, they want to break up the country. But at the end of this election, if there is a hung parliament, some of his MPs said today that the two parties could talk to each other about passing legislation. On the bus to Bristol he was pressed, would he talk to them on anyway behind the scenes? On changing legislation, no. Ed Miliband conceded last night there could be a minority government. He thinks he’s dealt with all the issues about whether there could be a deal, or make that no deal, with the SNP. But questions remain. In Dundee the SNP leader said Scottish voters would be appalled. If Ed Miliband is really saying he would rather have a Tory government than work with the SNP for more progressive politics, then its final proof that Labour has lost the plot. It would be the final nail in the Coffin of Scottish Labour, and ice expected labour in other parts of the UK, and it makes it more important that we have a big team of SNP is because we will need them to protect Scotland from the Tories, because clearly Ed Miliband is not prepared to do it. -- because clearly Ed Miliband is not prepared to do it. -- SNP ‘s. After a hard time he got last night Ed Miliband knows he can’t afford to slip up. I think morgues people are interested, not in me walking off the stage, but with David Cameron walking away with their child benefit. Flying up to Scotland tonight, he has to fight for votes here, while reassuring those who still think deals might be done here. james Cook is in Glasgow. james, what sort of reception is Mr Miliband likely to get? He hasjust He has just arrived in the last couple of minutes. He was whisked past a group of protesters by police and into the back door of this venue, red Tories out, is what they were chanting. That is the problem Mr Miliband is facing. Here in Scotland his opponents are trying to characterise him as preferring a Tory government to doing any kind of deal with the SNP. That’s almost what he said last night. On the other hand, if he does agree with negotiating with the SNP, Mr Miliband feels he will lose votes in middle England, particularly if, as he would see it, he concentrates on bringing down the deficit, public spending, and not renewing the Trident public weapons system. It’s difficult to see how Esther Miliband can square that circle and win in both England and Scotland at this election. -- how Mr Miliband. While Labour has been seemingly ruling out a deal with the SNP, David Cameron has said a coalition with another party would depend on them accepting a referendum on Britain’s EU membership, something the Liberal Democrats are currently opposed to. Mr Cameron also faced questions today about the party’s plans for child benefit, as our correspondent Gavin Hewitt reports. David Cameron’s bus headed across the Pennines, confident in his performance in last night’s debate but where the voters seem unforgiving with evasive answers. -- but aware. His first stop was the headquarters of Asda. In these final days Labour is determined to make Tory plans for child benefit an election issue saying they have refused to rule out cutting child benefits. Last night it was clear that the subject of child benefits remains hugely important. Can you be precise, what are you ruling in and out? We said we had to freeze it in this Parliament, freeze it at the start of the new parliament, but child benefit stays because it’s so important. But the Tories insist they will not reduce or cut child benefit, their problem is that they are still under pressure to explain where they will find £12 billion in welfare cuts. The Chancellor and David Cameron met at a road construction site near Lancaster. With less than one week to go the major parties are beginning to set out their negotiating positions post election if they need to four make coalition, including what some of their red lines might be. For David Cameron, one red line would be an EU referendum and dropping that would be a deal-breaker. The Tory leader insists he does not want a coalition. But I think it’s perfectly fair in the next six days to say, I’ve done a coalition, we made it work, we have a good record, I’ve got the T-shirt. But I don’t want to do it again. I think Britain would do better now with a strong, decisive and more accountable government. Later, asked whether a tie-up with Ukip was a possibility, the Tory leader said he did not believe they would have any MPs. Nick Clegg has insisted the Liberal Democrats will not go into coalition with a larger party without clear commitments on future funding for the NHS. The Deputy Prime Minister said ensuring a new government met an £8 billion a year target for the NHS by 2020 was, for him, a political ""red line."" Meanwhile, the UKIP Leader, Nigel Farage has said he could see his party lending support to a second Conservative-Lib Dem coalition on issues to do with the budget and motions of confidence. Mr Farage said it would only happen though, if there was a clear commitment to a referendum on the EU. Well, our political correspondent Ben Wright is at Westminster for us. Ben, are we any nearer knowing who is likely to do a deal with whom? out, Ukip will not work with Labour, Nick Clegg will not work with the SNP. It’s like there are two parallel campaigns going on, Ed Miliband and David Cameron charging rent a country insisting they will win outright, and one of them might. The other campaign dominated by talk of red lines and deals with the polling pointing to a hung parliament. Ed Miliband has said he will not do a deal with the SNP to get into Downing Street. Next week David Cameron might find himself looking forfriends and David Cameron might find himself looking for friends and allies, the Liberal Democrats and the DUP for instance. If no party gets an overall majority it becomes a battle to find support in the Commons. Next week we will know how the seats stacked up and who might be heading to number ten. In Nepal, the government says it’s struggling to cope six days after the devastating earthquake. It’s appealed for more helicopters to be sent by foreign governments, as relief teams’ efforts to reach remote villages continue. Clive Myrie is in Kathmandu for us this evening. It is an enormous challenge getting aid to those who need it and many of the community is cut off by the earthquake are in a note areas. -- remote The Nepalese Government has been criticised for its lack of organisation in distributing the aid and many rescue and medical teams have been frustrated at the chaos and confusion. Our correspondent justin Rowlatt travelled with an Indian Airforce rescue mission taking supplies by helicopter to one of the most remote areas of Nepal cut off by the devastation, to see the aid effort in operation. Nepal is one of the most challenging places on earth to organise a relief operation. Some of the worst hit communities are also the most isolated. Whole villages here in the foothills of the Himalayas have been razed to the ground. We are circling to try and find a place to land. This is one of the first flights into this isolated mountain community. Even helicopters struggle to operate in a country like this. The pilot isn’t sure it is safe to bring the helicopter in. They don’t actually want to land the helicopter. There is no room. We have jumped out and they are going to throw out the medical supplies, the food and the shelter by hand. They can’t stand on ceremony as they unload. There is real need here. We are very sad because we have no village. He says every house has been destroyed. The village of 400 people is now living under sheets of tarpaulin. And logistics aren’t the only challenge for the relief effort. There is growing anger about what is seen as a lack of coordination by the Government. I would prefer that there would be a central command who will organise things. It didn’t happen, we didn’t waste our time sitting doing nothing in Kathmandu and just pushed forward. There are no shortage of people who need their help. This man waited four days for help for his injured wife then carried her up the hill on his back. The Government admits dealing with this tragedy is a challenge for Nepal. This is a calamity of enormous proportions. Enormous proportion for any country and especially for a country like Nepal that is so limited in resources, so limited in physical infrastructure, so limited in everything. All the while more casualties are being brought in from shattered communities across Nepal. justin Rowlatt, BBC News, Kathmandu. BFEBS areas the difficulties of distributing aid in this land. 22 year old Annie Tinsley from Devon was caught up and survived the earthquake and avalanches on Mount Everest. And last night 27 year old Krishnaa was pulled out from the rubble of a building alive but badly injured, miraculously surviving for five days under the remains of a building. I went to see them both to discover how the survivors were coping. It is the dream of many a young Briton, to trek across Asia without a care in the world. But Annie Tinsley’s trip to Mount Everest coincided with the worst earthquake to hit Nepal in 80 years. What do we do? just stay down. I just felt the rumbling. I didn’t quite know or grasp the seriousness of the situation. The quake triggered an avalanche and Annie recorded these pictures as she ran for her life. I looked to our right and there was just a massive avalanche coming our way. Get down. SCREAMING. Do you count yourself lucky? Yes, definitely. We were five minutes away from being on the glacier and if we were on the glacier, there is nothing to hold on to there. We met a few others who were on the other side of the glacier and they said it was the worst experience of their life. This is another tale of survival. Krishna was buried in rubble after the quake. She was pinned to the floor of her home by masonry with no food or water for five days. Rescue workers discovered her yesterday and we watched as a medic fitted the drip that helped to save her life. With her kidneys failing doctors say at best she had 24 hours to live. You are trying to listen to every sound around, to think Will someone come or will I never see anyone who is going to save me? Her physical condition will improve, but there is no question she will need some psychological support. Nepal’s nightmare has left more than 6000 dead and many are missing, including a thousand Europeans. Krishna and Annie both made it, two women who beat an earthquake. Tomorrow we will see, exactly seven days since the earth began to move here, setting off a chain of events. There is no question that this country has said it will pick UP this country has said it will pick up the pieces and recover from this drama, but the fact is it is poorer and it is tiny and it will need all the international help it can get. Our top story this evening: Ed Miliband has again said there will be no Coalition and no deal with the SNP after the election. Still to come: they’ve been the team top for most of the season but can Chelsea finally celebrate the Premier League title this weekend? Later on BBC London. The race between the yellows and blues in south west London - as the Tories target the Lib Dem seat of Kingston and Surbiton. And the ups and downs of the football league - we look at the clubs in line for promotion and those fighting the drop. challenge cup final. And it may be the 1st of May, but our ski resorts are experiencing excellent snow. Now, it’s a bold claim, a new battery for the home that could change the entire world’s energy infrastructure. But that’s how the boss of Tesla Motors, the American firm which makes electric cars, describes its latest product. It’s a battery charged by solar panels that allows home-owners to have electricity without relying on the National Grid. Our Industry correspondent john Moylan reports. It is the US company that has made electric vehicles cool. But could the technology that powers the Tesla car transform how we power our homes? At a glitzy launch in California the company unveiled this, a domestic battery which its billionaire founder claims will revolutionise green energy. You can go if you want completely off grid. You can take your solar panels, charge the battery packs and that is all you use. If that sounds too futuristic, think again. Because this house in west London is already taking part in a trial to work out whether we could all have batteries in our homes. The storage system is around the corner here. Peter Frankel has had solar panels for years. Now he can get the benefit 24 hours a day. This is the piece of kit. It has got batteries in it and it collects electricity from our solar panels up in the roof and during the day when the sun is shining, and then at night if we need electricity, it gives it back to us. Peter is taking part in a Government-backed trial. He did not pay for his battery, so he is yet to decide whether the sums add up. Experts say that the price will be crucial if Tesla’s version is to take off. The major hurdle is the only people who are going to buy it are the first adopters. This is paying $3000 to store $3 worth of electricity. You are not going to do that unless you are very keen on the technology. Tesla hopes millions of households will be keen. If the company is right, it could be a money spinner for them and give a huge jolt to the energy world. A former chief constable has told the inquest into the Hillsborough disaster that he regretted saying that Liverpool fans had made the police’sjob much harder than it needed to be. Sir Norman Bettison was a Chief inspector with South Yorkshire police when the tragedy happened in 1989. judith Moritz is at the inquest in Warrington. judith, what more did he say? Well, we heard about September 2012 when the Hillsborough Independent panel published its report into the disaster, and about remarks which Sir Norman Bettis, who was then the chief constable of Yorkshire please, made in the wake of that report. He said the behaviour of Liverpool fans at Hillsborough had made thejob of policing harder than it needed to be. He later apologised for that, but he was asked about the remarks today and he sat in the witness box yard away from the bereaved families. He said he regretted saying what he did on the day, but it was a time and a place and he said he found himself at the front of the allegations of cover-up and he ended up saying what he said in a hurried and ill thought out way and it had caused a fire storm. He will be questioned on his evidence next week by lawyers representing the families. Prosecutors in the American city of Baltimore say six police officers will face criminal charges over the death of a black man in custody. Freddie Gray suffered fatal spinal injuries while in custody, sparking violent protests. The charges range from second-degree murder to assault. Now, they’ve dominated the Premier League since the season kicked off and now Chelsea are just one win away from their first title in five years. All that stands between them and the big prize this Sunday is Crystal Palace. But are they, as rivals claim, the most boring team to win the league in a decade? Natalie Pirks examines the evidence. CHANTING: Boring, boring Chelsea! On Wednesday night when Chelsea went just one win away from securing the title their fans responded to rivals’ taunts with a gleeful line in irony. Boring, boring Chelsea! The special one says this is a special team. You will find always a Chelsea very strong in every ranking. That is why in such a difficult league to win we are top of the league since day one. The Stamford Bridge museum is full of memorabilia from the club’s past and if this current side win on Sunday, they will have to make a bit more room for their first league title in five years. But will they have bored their way to the trophy? Chelsea have scored 68 goals so far this season. Last season Manchester City scored 102. They average only 11 shots a game, fewer than any other Premier League title winner in the last decade. But statistics can also work both ways and 68 goals is only one goal fewer than Arsenal’s famous Invincibles had at this stage in 2004. It is fair to say Chelsea’s march to the title has divided opinion. They could have been naive and kept on playing openly. They probably wouldn’t be on top of the league just now. So it may look less exciting, but it is an intelligent way to play. Chelsea boast the PFA player of the year in Eden Hazard. And they haven’t lost since New Year’s day. Perhaps then the only thing boring about the champions elect are those rivals who fell short. Natalie Pirks, BBC News. The American soul singer Ben E King, best known for the hit song Stand By Me, has died at the age of 76. # Stand by me, oh, stand by me... He originally found fame with the Drifters before quitting the group in 1960. After going solo, he hit the US top five with Stand By Me the following year. The song returned to the charts in the 1980s, following its use in the film of the same name. Back to the election now and one of the most memorable aspects of last night’s Question Time was the audience. The tough questioning and the no nonsense approach of the people of Yorkshire meant the party leaders really had to think on their feet in Leeds as our Special correspondent Richard Bilton found out when he went to meet some of those invited along last night. After helping shake up the election campaign, Catherine Shuttleworth was today back running her marketing company. She did sign the letter from small businesses supporting conservatives, but she says she is not a Tory and does not know who she will vote for. Last night she took Ed Miliband to task. I ask you why should I trust a Chancellor. If he worked in the corporate world he would have been fired and he would not have been allowed back to do thatjob. Let me tell you, Ed Balls takes incredibly seriously the need to get the deficit down. The audience whether people who asked the questions and they were the people who help them to account and thatis people who help them to account and that is the first time for a lot people. Why should we trust you? It was a feisty audience with all three leaders given a rough time. You cannot give specifics and I find that very difficult to understand. Your promise on student loans has destroyed your reputation. Why would we believe anything else you say? What was striking about the debate was the level of frustration in the audience. It was the real see step. Even after five weeks of campaigning he was a group of people who still had not got the kind of detailed answers they wanted. It felt really goodin answers they wanted. It felt really good in the fat people should be able to ask questions. Linda Green was part of the onslaught. She said she would vote Labour and last night she tackled David Cameron. People are using food banks and they have been hit by benefit sanctions. That is not a country I want to hand down to my child. First of all, let me say I do not want anyone to have to rely on food banks in our country. They were so worried about saying the wrong thing, making gaffes, that what we are not having is an interesting debate where people are raising real issues. Things that happen in everyday lives. Less than a week to go, but many voters clearly still wa nt a week to go, but many voters clearly still want more the politicians. Time for a look at the weather. No-nonsense No- nonsense weather from No-nonsense weather from this Yorkshireman. Tomorrow some of us will wake up to a frost tomorrow, particularly where you are clear. Cloud has been increasing towards the south-west of the UK and there is some patchy light rain and drizzle on offer overnight. As ever it is colder in the countryside, so this gives you an idea of some of the coldest rural spots going into the morning. Maybe an excuse for a lion. There will be a frosty start and a dry day to follow with the rain making slow progress into the South West and South Wales and turning heavier eventually in Northern Ireland. Some gales developing in places. As we go through Saturday night for England a lot of this rain comes through overnight and then it feeds into Scotland on Saturday night and into Sunday. This is no and strong cold winds in northern Scotland. Elsewhere there are some warm, sunny spells developing on Sunday. You may catch a heavy and thundery shower, but most of us will not. On the bank holiday itself there is a window of fine weather. There is a potential this could bring rain to southern parts of the UK later in the day. A few showers come up into Scotland, but temperatures are in the mid teens. We are watching that in the south. Foryour gardens teens. We are watching that in the south. For your gardens there is nothing wrong with a bit of rain. That’s all from the BBC News at Six, so it’s goodbye from me and on BBC one we nowjoin the BBC’s news teams where you are. On the programme tonight: We get a first look inside the Surrey stately home destroyed by a fire - as details emerge of priceless paintings and artefacts that have been saved. Despite the devastation we have heard how a well rehearsed procedure by the fire Brigade has saved many artefacts. A minute’s silence for loved ones.

15,BBC1 London,1-may-2015,BBC London News,18:30,30 mins,True,"Welcome to BBC London News with me Riz Lateef. A vigil has been held at Downing street by family and friends of young people killed in gun and knife crime. The event was organised by the father of London teenager, Kiyan Prince. The 15-year-old was stabbed to death outside his school nine years ago. Here’s Ayshea Buksh. It was our morning of song and solemnity. Young people remembered by those who loved them. Families and friendsjoined youth by those who loved them. Families and friends joined youth groups and charities for a unique event. The project was inspired by the family of Kiyan Prince, an aspiring footballer who was murdered outside his school nine years ago. It is so easy to forget these lies as just get on with our lives and forget that these are young people that have families. -- that these are young people that have families. -- forget these lives. The list of young people killed in the UK in the past ten years is over 400. It is increasing every day. just last night a teenager was stabbed in Paddington. This person was once involved in turf wars and knows how fights escalate. I had a few bytes when I was younger. People started to use weapons. I became a prisoner to that mentality. Today is the jewel offered comfort and support. It has strengthened us and given as an aspiration. It will have a positive effect. One minutes to remember those who have lost. Remember the young people who lost their lives. This event may be coming to an end but it is hoped the sentiment will translate into action and just like the balloons that where released the sentiment will travel to other parts of the UK. Coming up later in the programme, could both pieces of silverware the heading to the Greater London area? Police are investigating new allegations of electoral fraud following last week’s High Courtjudgement which forced the Mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, to step down. Five new allegations, which had not been previously reported to police, have been identified within a High Court report. Four of those are now being assessed to see if a criminal investigation should be carried out. The former Dj Neil Fox is to stand trial charged with sexually assaulting young women and three girls under the age of 16. The nine offences are said to have happened over two decades. A trial will be held in November. He denies the charges. A huge new roof garden - opens to the public in east London today. It’s more than 250 metres long, has tropical plants and walkways and will be open from dawn till dusk. It’s part of a seven storey building at Canary Wharf which has shops, restaurants and a cinema and will also house the Crossrail station - when the trains start running in three year’s time. He’s famous for his portrayal of Grant Mitchell in Eastenders and his documentaries in conflict zones - but today Ross Kemp was in East London, battling to win over small business owners ahead of the general election. Sarah Harris reports. Actor and documentary maker Ross Kemp arrives in his hometown to support the Labour Party. He is about to face some tough questions. This person set up his news agency two years ago and has been struggling to keep things going. He believes a bolt for the Labour Party would be a mistake. -- believes a bolt for the Labour Party would be a mistake. -- eight vote. When things are so close and you hear business people seeing the Tories have got things straight for the economy. Ido not think the Tories have got things straight for the economy. The economy adjusted itself. You do not think you are being looked after. There were plenty of people who agreed with Ross Kemp on policy and applauded Labour plans to reduce business rates. At this person is not convinced. She started her business injanuary. I have seen convinced. She started her business in january. I have seen you injanuary. I have seen you on television. She believes balancing the books should be as much a concern for a future Government as a test for her. Previous Labour governments, there has been understanding for businesses. You cannot blame Labour spending on economic global turn down. That happens because over borrowing by banks. Labour is hoping that this will persuade voters still sceptical about the record. Can a yellow corner of London really turn blue? The Tories are sending in their big hitters to target Liberal Democrat seats in the South West. Some, like Kingston and Surbiton have been held by the Lib Dems for nearly 20 years. But, with a high student population could the issue of tuition fees make a difference? Continuing our series Every Vote Counts Marc Ashdown has more. May 2010 and a hastily assembled crew of blues and yellows sets sail on the good ship Coalition. Well, a rowing boat. Against all odds they stay afloat, working together, pulling in the same direction. Much of the time. But five years on they’re having to bail out and take each other on. It’s now blue versus yellow, perhaps nowhere more so than on the bank of the Thames in Kingston and Surbiton. Kingston sits in the heart of this Liberal Democrat power base in Southwest London. These four seats are the biggest single clutch that the Lib Dems have anywhere in the country. They do face a battle to hold onto them all. Here in Kingston Ed Davey with a majority of 7,500, 13.2%. That would ordinarily be quite safe but not this year. In Carshalton and Wallington, Tom Brake, with a 5,200 majority, 11.5%, also looking a bit precarious. Most at risk is Paul Burstow in neighbouring Sutton and Cheam with a majority ofjust 1,600. At a slender 3.3% it will not take much for the Conservatives to overturn it. Much more safe is Vince Cable in Twickenham. His 12,000 majority is 20%. The Conservatives are throwing lots of money and resources at this seat. They are quietly confident they could unseat the man thought of by many as untouchable. Kingston is a university town with 21,000 students. Lots of votes but lots still feeling let down after the Lib Dems promised not to touch tuition fees and ended up trebling them. The Lib Dems screwed students over. Most of them are going towards Labour. I am not going to vote for someone that can’t keep promises. People have become quite cynical. They know that they make all these promises to get votes but when it comes to the crunch it probably won’t happen. Ed Davey though wants to talk about education showing us a proposed free school in an office block on the High Street which highlights, he says, the folly of the policy. He is confident the promises his party did keep after the last election will go down well on the doorstep. I think we are fighting back. The Tories have put a lot of money into here because these are all close Lib Dem - Tory fights but we are good campaigners, Liberal Democrats. All the MPs here have got good local reputations. People who get things done. I think Liberal Democrats are people’s insurance policy against political instability and to make sure that economic I’âCOVâI’y COI’1tiIâ1UâS. Speaking of which: The Green shoots of economic recovery. Their candidate may be as green as these plants when it comes to political experience but he’s had the backing of countless Conservative big hitters. Even here though there is equal amounts of blue and yellow. No, I am not a Lib Dem supporter, I am an Ed Davey supporter. I vote Conservative but usually I would vote Ed Davey. Obviously there are a lot of challenges going up against a Cabinet minister is a long-time incumbent MP with a big majority and very well resourced, but Ijust working hard for every vote and doing what I can to persuade people that voting for the Conservatives is the right choice for the area and also for the country. Despite only pulling 9% last time Labour fancy their chances of an upset. We have had cutbacks and cutbacks and cutbacks. They say the Lib Dem vote is collapsing, their candidate is in big trouble. He’s gone. The students and against him. The people don’t want him any more. The Lib Dems have seen a turbulent five years. The council leader was jailed. The sun is setting on the current coalition. Kingston and Surbiton has always been firmly yellow. This is the act of London could be a bellwether. Nobody is sure of London could be a bellwether. Nobody is sure And this is the full list of candidates standing in Kingston and Surbiton in less than a week on the 7th of May. Don’t forget, you can find plenty more information about the general election on the BBC Election website. It was a fire that damaged all but one room - leaving a Grade I listed stately home in Surrey - nothing but a shell. As the salvage operation at the 18th Century Clandon Park House continues - details have emerged of some of the priceless paintings and artefacts that have been saved. The head of the National Trust has praised the awe-inspiring efforts of the firefighters. Tonight we get a first look inside the mansion - or what’s left of it. And Chris Rogers is there for us. which way for 12 hours the fire raged. 85 firefighters were at the scene. It isjust a shell. But amazingly beneath the Ashes there are still some parts of this unique collection of artefacts and antiques. It isjust not safe enough to go in there and retrieve them. But out of the ruins may emerge the fantastic story of how the National Trust and the Fire Brigade works together to dry to rescue some of the collection. This was a well rehearsed procedure. That is right. It is common practice for the Fire Service and the National Trust to exercise on a regular basis these sort of procedures. You hope that you never had to do this. On Wednesday evening we had to turn practice into reality. Everything worked well. We are overwhelmed by the sense of professionalism from our staff and from the Fire Brigade. What did you do? Did you go in as teams? When the Fire Service arrived they would have been given a must of the most valuable items in the collection. The reader have identified where they were ads tried to salvage as much as possible. Some of those collections are as valuable as the bricks and mortar. The focus on salvaging the items and the building. It has been a tough day as you can imagine. The Fire Brigade have been inspecting the building to see if it can BC to achieve what is left of the collection. They also want to find out what started the fire. And they also have to decide on the future of the building itself which is uncertain. Still to come bash this story that helped one survivor. Still to come this Friday evening: The love story that helped one survivor of a World War Two concentration camp rebuild her life. Time now to get the weekend sport- and it’s all about football, which will become completely clear as we cross over to Sara Orchard and two rather large clues. ~ "" WE - - we have -- we have the championship trophy and the Premier League trophy. They can with their very own security. Let us talk about Watford first. We already knew that they had been promoted to the Premier League that can they go on as champions of the championship? They have two win the game tomorrow. Let us go down to the other end of the table. Let us talk about Chelsea. They could become Premier League champions this weekend if they win the home game against Crystal Palace. But the trophy still has the Manchester City ribbons on it. Because even if Chelsea duo win this weekend they will have to wait until the last day of the season when they play Sunderland to be presented with the trophy. Obviously we wa nt trophy. Obviously we want to finish as soon as possible. It will be a great atmosphere. If they beat as we will accept it because I am pretty sure we are going to be at the races. Quite a game at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. But there is so much going on with all of London’s cost this weekend. We already knew that Millwall has been relegated earlier this week. Here is the full round-up. This seems last April when Bedford won promotion back to the second year of football. Now they hope to be on the rise again. -- year of football. Now they hope to be on the rise again. -- Brentford. They could get into the play-offs. They have an opportunity. Embrace the challenge. In League 1 Crawley and Leyton orient face a final date scrap to avoid relegation. Crawley have had plenty to celebrate recently backed on Sunday they must beat Coventry to stay in the division. This is the highest league big club has been in and that is the most important game the club has had in this league. It is the most important game in the history of the club. At Leyton Orient the fall from grace has been spectacular. Last May they were close to promotion from the championship. They lost to rather than at Wembley and then it went wrong. The owner sold the club to an Italian businessman last summer. Beer has been turmoil. Leyton orient now need a miracle to stay up. They must beat Swindon. They need three other results to go up. They must beat Swindon. They need three other results to go their this season has not gone as we thought it should. Four of the teams from the region are seeking promotion from League 2. The entire thing is riding on 90 minutes of football. The important thing is that these players recognise that. Last season work on Wanderers stayed at on the final day. Tomorrow they could go up on the final day. We have got to win that game and see what else happens. Stevenage have done well to get a play-off place. Tomorrow they visit Britain and have a mathematical-- and they have a mathematical chance. This is football. 90 minutes to go and all to play for. And to keep up with all the latest newsjune end to BBC London digital radio. you are a fan of a London football club good luck. Next, the remarkable story of 90-year-old Eva from Finchley - who survived the horrors of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. We heard yesterday how 70 years after its liberation she returned to Germany, a country she never thought she’d have the strength to go back to. Tonight we hear about the months after the camp and how she slowly rebuilt her life thanks to the man who would then become her husband. As Tarah Welsh reports. She makes herjourney surrounded by family today. But when Eva came to the camp that stood here 70 years ago she was alone, cold and seriously ill from months spent in Auschwitz. It took four days to get there. I arrived in Belsen on the Ist of january 1945. I was so cold in the wagon. Today the rain fell hard but the warmth from her family seemed to get her through the shock of standing back on German soil. At 20 years old she was surrounded by disease, hunger and thousands of dead bodies. For decades she tried to forget the horror. But now she wants to remember a better time, Germany after the war. I want to see the place where I met my husband. He gave me 63 wonderful years. Amazingly he saved my life. I was very sick. When the British liberated the camp Eva was taken to an army barracks. She then moved to this town. Her family wants to trace her life here. We have photos, a map, no firm addresses and fading memories. They find the synagogue where she met new friends and the man that would change her life, Sammy. He was based here with the RAF. He went on to have a family with Eva in London but passed away five years ago. She barely recognises it but when she gets to her first home her 90 years won’t stop her from going up. It never looked so clean I promise you! LAUGHTER. There is the path. He came back from England. I saw him running down that path. He saw me at the window. He was running down that path. Sammy had returned from leave determined to make Eva his wife. Did you just come here then? Yes, we would just walk here. We used to walk around the lake. This is where my life began. And after decades of trying to suppress the memories of her time in Germany only now did she feel ready to come back. I am very happy I made the journey. It is a sort of closure for me, a very sad one in the campsite, and a veryjolly one in this town. Here is the weather. It is not looking too bad. Some good spells of sunshine through the course of today. Any showers were to the North of our area. Most places will be dry. There will be closed from the Southwest. One or two call spots in the usual places. Tomorrow will start on a dry zero. Early morning sunshine. Then the clouds will thicken up through the course of the afternoon. Saturday night we will see most of the region moving through the gym. -- see most of the region moving through the gym. -- through the area. Sunday morning starts off on a damp note. But an improvement through the day. This is the pressure start -- through the day. This is the pressure start -- the pressure chart. Things could turn wetter for the second half of Monday. Sunday will be quite warm. Monday later in the day there could be outbreaks of Green. Main headlines. As the election campaign enters its final week the Prime Minister has repeated his warnings of a Labour government propped up by the SNP. Ed Miliband hit back ruling out any coalition or deal with the SNP. In Nepal, the government says it’s struggling to cope six days after the earthquake. It’s appealed for more helicopters to be sent by foreign governments. At the inquest into the Hillsborough disaster a former chief constable, Sir Norman Bettison, has said he regretted saying that Liverpool fans had made the police’sjob much harder than it needed to be. More on the day’s stories on our website. And Alice Bhandhukravi will back with our late news. So from all of us here, thanks for watching and have a lovely weekend. There we go. It was five years ago that we started the journey and introduced something which had been missing from the British government for decades - compassion... and fairness, built on consensus and cooperation. A vote for us in 2010 put an end to Labour’s mismanagement of the economy. And it made sure that there was a party in government that could fight off unfair Tory cuts. A vote for us brought stability to Britain and turned our economy around. We want to finish the job we started. A vote for us in 2015 will keep Britain on track, paying down the deficit in a fair way, enabling us to invest an extra £2.5 billion into education. That’s an opportunity for our future. A vote for us is an opportunity for young people, with more apprenticeships, discounted bus travel and, for the first time, help to rent their own place. We will create jobs, cut income tax by £400 a year, and bring in pay rises for millions of public sector workers. A vote for us is an opportunity for a better NHS - a service we will invest an extra £8 billion in to ensure we can cope with our ageing population. A vote for us is an opportunity for five more years of stability, cooperation and compassion. What happens next is up to you. Look left. You don’t want to be hit by a coalition of Ed Miliband and Alex Salmond and a commitment to drag us back into debt with Labour’s reckless borrowing. Look right. You don’t want to be hit by a coalition of right-wing cuts with Tories and Ukip putting public services at risk. Your vote will be the difference between a government of self-interest and grievance or a coalition of tolerance and decency. On May 7th, vote Liberal Democrat for a stronger economy and a fairer society with opportunity for everyone. CHURCHILL: 'The German war is at an end.' Churchill was a powerful leader, you were there right behind him. 'Today is Victory in Europe Day.' The war is over, we’re going to enjoy it now. Let’s have a party. I don’t know why I wasn’t rushing around, kissing soldiers, but I wasn’t! My father came back from the war as a superstar. We were free. To mark one of the most important days in British history... BBC One we nowjoin the BBC’s news teams where you are. Hello and welcome to your Friday One Show with Alex jones. And Chris Eva ns. Last night we featured women who were overdue, and one of them was Laura Williams. Seven days overdue. And the shock of seeing herself must have worked because this morning she gave birth to her little baby! Congratulations! Always start the show with a newborn baby, if you can! Coming up: A film about cheese, so how about some cheese jokes? How do you approach an angry Welsh cheese maker? Caerphilly! CHEERS What’s the best cheese for hiding a small horse? Mascarpone! CHEERS Are these jokes orjust questions? ""Camembert"" with us, I promise they’ll get ""Feta"" BOOS Kevin? On the way here I got caught UP Kevin? On the way here I got caught up with the May Day celebrations and somebody threw a cheddar sandwich at me, which I did not think was very APPLAUSE. That was what collocated than the original version! That was what collocated than the originalversion! Kevin original version! Kevin McCloud is here! 2-storey buildings have made the news this not because of their Grand Design but their Grand Destruction. Here’s the first one. It’s the Carlton Tavern, the only remaining building in its street to have survived the Blitz. The developers were denied planning permission but knocked it down anyway while the staff were out. week, they told the staff to go home. The building was about to get listed which is suspected to be the reason why they just got listed which is suspected to be the reason why theyjust got on with it! Worse still, it’s the very pub that The One Show football team used to go to for their post-match pint! Honestly! Bottom! Spiderman does not drink here! But good news, team. The council have demanded that it is rebuilt exactly as it was, brick by brick! You have asked me to wear this. I don’t mind! Kevin McCloud! I don’t think white is your colour! It is not very flattering! Go on. Grand Destruction number two. That’s the 1720s mansion Clandon Park House being all but destroyed by fire yesterday. It was one of the country’s most complete examples of a Palladian mansion, with huge stucco ceilings and an awe-inspiring marble hall. Angellica went to see if any of the 18th century treasures that the house was known for have survived. London or was built by Lord Onslow in the 1720s. And was left to the National Trust in 1956. Its most impressive feature was this marble hallway. Sadly, that has gone. Following Wednesday’s fire. It is very sad to see this building reduced to this. Not everything was destroyed and it is due to a remarkable rescue effort that was taking place as the fire took hold. We have got experience from other fires such as at Hampton Court and Windsor Castle so we recognise that this was a matter of containing the fire and biding our time and quickly it switched to a salvage operation. The operation was coordinated by the National Trust and was practised during a fire drill six weeks ago. As a result, everyone knew exactly what to do when the fire started. I think the fact that we had the drills are recently meant people could justjump into drills are recently meant people could just jump into autopilot and work very slickly with the Fire Brigade. Every room in the house, we have a map of the objects and the collection and key items have a star and those are the items we need the Fire Brigade to get out first. They are the most precious things. We literally had a human chain outside and The National Trust staff and community people were carrying the stuff down and getting it into the inventory, packed and shipped off-site. The collection they were trying to save was built by many generations the Onslow family and was started in the 17th century. It was at 11:30pm, the Fire Brigade ",,

Ed Miliband once again insists there’ll be ""no deal with the SNP"" - and tonight he takes his message to Scotland. Arriving for a speech in Glasgow this evening, Mr Miliband said he had no time for a party that wants to break up the UK. No deal, no pact, no coalition, no tie-up with the Scottish National Party. If Ed Miliband is really saying he would rather have a Tory government, than work with the SNP for more progressive politics, then it’s final proof that Labour has lost the plot. David Cameron faces questions about whether he’ll cut child benefit should the Conservatives win. We’ve said that we had to freeze it in this Parliament. We said were going to have to freeze it for the start of the new Parliament, but child benefit stays. We’ll bring you the latest tonight, as the election campaign steps up - with just six days to go. Also tonight, the grief of Nepal’s Sherpas - we have a special report from the base camp of Everest. We believe something in the region of six or seven foreigners died in this area, but we also understand more than double that number of Sherpas were killed here and the question now is what happens to their families.

Ed Miliband has spent the day insisting there’ll be no post-election deal with the SNP - a day after telling the BBC’s Question Time special that he would not have a Labour government if it meant deals or coalitions with the Nationalists. Tonight he took his message to Scotland, saying his pledge was made on a matter of principle, and not for tactical reasons. David Cameron said the prospect of a Labour government propped up by the SNP was as real as ever. The SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said that Labour had ""lost the plot"" and that voters would be appalled. Our correspondent Lucy Manning reports. Ed Miliband flying into Glasgow. Scotland used to be Labour. Now it’s Labour’s problem. Why not the front door? Not the reception party leaders used to get in Scotland. Ed Miliband came here trying to lose the idea he’ll work with the SNP, yet trying to win votes from them. Don’t gamble with the SNP. Don’t gamble with the SNP when you can guarantee change with Labour. No deal, no pact, no coalition, no tie in with the Scottish National Party. Mr Miliband seemed to concede last night there could be a minority government, but he’s been clear no coalition, no deals, but what exactly does he mean by no deals? As he started his day on the train to Cardiff, it was clear he meant what he said last night. That he would rather not be in government than do a deal with the SNP. The SNP say it sounds like you want to work with or a government rather than the SNP. Do you? Not at all. I made clear last night I’m not having a Labour government based on a deal with the Scottish National Party. How people vote in Parliament is up to them. The SNP want to break up the country. Later, on the bus to Bristol, he was pressed, would you talk to them in any way behind the scenes? No. In Dundee, the SNP leader said Scottish voters would be appalled. If Ed Miliband would rather have a Tory government than work with the SNP for progressive politics in its final proof that Labour has lost the plot, it will be the final the seats here, Scotland could cost Mr Miliband power, or in a hung parliament help him achieve it. Let’s go to our Scotland correspondent james Cook. How much of a risk is Mr Miliband taking, delivering his message tonight in Scotland? Ina In a sense Ed Miliband has nothing to lose. Isn’t that an extraordinary thing to say? In 2010, the Labour Party took 1+1 of the 59 seats in Scotland, the SNP, six. Everything appears to have changed. The referendum on independence may have been the catalyst or accelerator for the change but the SNP has been building support since the establishment of the Scottish Parliament 1999. establishment of the Scottish Parliament1999. Ed Parliament 1999. Ed Miliband has been faced with a choice. Does he embraced the Scottish National Party, as fellow social Democrats, or does he turn his back on them as dangerous separatists? He has chosen the latter of those two Â dangerous separatists? He has chosen the latter of those two Â that made play in England for him, maybe successful for play in England for him, maybe successfulfor him in England, where polls suggests they are not happy about the influence of SNP in a British government, but the polls suggest it may not play so well in Scotland. Ed Miliband said, don’t take a gamble with the SNP. He is taking a pretty weak gamble himself with this message. -- big gamble. Meanwhile David Cameron has been facing his own questions about his party’s plans for child benefit, should they form the next government. Ed Miliband said it was ""brutally clear"" that the Conservatives would cut child benefit, in order to help meet its proposed welfare savings of £12 billion. Mr Cameron insisted it was ""vital"" and would stay. Here’s our correspondent Gavin Hewitt. David Cameron’s bus headed across the Pennines, confident in his performance in last night’s debate but aware the voters seem unforgiving with evasive answers. His first stop, the headquarters of Asda. In these final days Labour is determined to make Tory plans for child benefit an election issue, saying they have refused to rule out cutting the payment. Last night it was clear the subject of child benefit remains hugely important. Can you be precise - what are you ruling in and what are you ruling out? We’ve said that we had to freeze it in this Parliament, we’ve said we’re going to have to freeze it for the start of the new Parliament, but child benefit stays because it’s so important. The Tories insist they will not cut or reduce child benefit. A spokesman said that would be for the life of the next Parliament, although the Prime Minister didn’t go so far. The overall scale of this bridge... David Cameron spent some time today Chancellor at a road construction site near Lancaster. The Tory problem is that they’re still under pressure to explain where they will find £12 billion in welfare cuts. With less than a week to go the major parties are beginning to set out their negotiating positions post the election, if they need to form a coalition - including what some of their red lines might be. For David Cameron one red line is an EU referendum - dropping that would be a deal-breaker and the Tory leader insists he doesn’t want a coalition. I think it’s perfectly fair in the next six days to say look, I’ve done coalition, we made it work, we’ve got a good record, I’ve got the T-shirt, but I don’t want to do that again. I think Britain would do better now with a strong, decisive and frankly more accountable government. Later, asked whether a tie-up with Ukip was a possibility, the Tory leader said he didn’t believe they would have any MPs. Nick Clegg has insisted the Liberal Democrats will not go into coalition with a larger party without clear commitments on future funding for the NHS. The Deputy Prime Minister said ensuring a new government met an £8 billion a year target for the NHS by 2020 was for him a political ""red line"". Meanwhile, the Ukip leader Nigel Farage has said he could see his party lending support to a second Conservative/Lib Dem coalition - on issues to do with the budget and motions of confidence. But Mr Farage said it would only happen if there was a clear commitment to a referendum on the EU. So with just six days to go, if you want to try forming your own coalition and get to the magic number for a majority - 326 - try it out on the BBC’s very own Coalition Builder. And you can see the address there on your screens. In Nepal, the government says it’s struggling to cope almost a week after the devastating earthquake. As relief teams attempt to reach remote villages - there are appeals for more helicopters to be sent by foreign governments. Clive Myrie is in Kathmandu for us tonight. Yes, it is an enormous challenge, getting aid to all those people who need it. Something like 8 million people are thought to need urgent assistance, like water or shelter or food. A lot of the communities that have been cut off are in remote areas to stop the Nepalese government has been criticised for a lack of coordination of the relief effort. A number of medical search teams and others are frustrated by what they see as confusion and chaos. Our correspondentjustin Rowlatt has travelled with the Indian air force to one remote region to see the aid effort in operation. Nepal is one of the most challenging places on earth to organise a relief operation. Some of the worst hit communities are also the most isolated. Whole villages here in the foothills of the Himalayas have been razed to the ground. We are circling to try and find a place to land. This is one of the first flights into this isolated mountain community. Even helicopters struggle to operate in country like this. The pilot isn’t sure it’s safe to bring a helicopter in. They don’t actually want to land the helicopter. There isn’t room. We’ve jumped out and they’re going to throw out the medical supplies, the food and the shelter they’ve brought. They can’t stand on ceremony as they unload. There is real need here. We are very sad because we have not... He says every house has been destroyed. The village of 400 people are now living under sheets of tarpaulin. And logistics aren’t the only challenge for the relief effort. There is growing anger about what is seen as a lack of coordination by the government. When no one told this Israeli rescue team where they were needed, theyjust headed out on their own. I would prefer that there was a central command, who will organise things. Since it didn’t happen we didn’t waste our time sitting doing nothing in Kathmandu - we just pushed forward. And there’s no shortage of people who need their help. This man waited four days for help for his injured wife, then he carried her up the hill on his back. The government admits dealing with this tragedy is a challenge for Nepal. This is a calamity of enormous proportion. Enormous proportion for any country, and especially for a country like Nepal, that is so limited in resources and physical infrastructure and limited in everything. And all the while more casualties are being brought in from shattered communities across Nepal. Well, climbers on Everest are often supported by teams of Sherpas, act as porters, guides or cooks. Many were on the mountain last week when the earthquake and avalanche struck, and some of them lost their lives. Events last Saturday highlighted the risk they take to feed their families. The mountain that gives life can steal it away. One week since the earthquake and the Sherpa community is mourning its dead. This man was on Everest last Friday. He’d been caught in an avalanche before. His family pleaded with him not to go. He leaves a mother bereft a wife and a baby son alone. She says she’s trying to be strong. But when she sees his friends it’s too painful. And this is what’s become of her village and her neighbours. This woman. And this woman. And now this man, whose house threatens to fall on his head any time. There’s no aid, no rescue missions, no miracles. This was the scene one week ago. Two climbers on Everest as the earthquake struck, unleashing a massive avalanche heading in their direction. Benjamin, a wounded US veteran, and Dennis, his guide. There’s this huge wave of cloud coming down, maybe 200 or 300 feet high, and it looked like the whole side of the mountain was coming down, racing at us. I put my head down and I thought that was it. All I could do was think about my five and seven-year-old kids, and that I wouldn’t see them again. This is where the avalanche struck. Everest base camp. It’s where the other Sherpas and the foreign climbers were killed. Last year locals bore the brunt of casualties here and so it has been again. The process of trying to salvage the belongings of the mountaineers and the Sherpas who were injured here and those who died here, is now under way. The whole area is strewn with the remnants of what was the middle part of base camp before the avalanche swept through this area forcing all possessions and people out of its way. We believe something in the region of six or seven foreigners died in this area. The precise number still isn’t clear. We also understand that more than double that number of Sherpas were killed here and the question now is what happens to their families, what kind of protection is available to them. The Sherpas understand the risks better than anyone. But helping foreigners climb Everest can lift them from poverty. So they bear most of the load and take most of the risk, in one of the most dangerous places on earth. A seasoned British climber told me, these mountains are asleep but they’ll wake and they’ll kill you. Ian Pannell, BBC News. Tomorrow it will be exactly a week since the ground began to move here, setting off a chain of events that devastated so many lives. I have been here for the last five or six days, and I have heard stories of suffering and pain, but also hope and courage as well. You talk to local people and they will tell you, yes, we will rise again, we will rebuild this place after last week’s earthquake, but we are going to need international help for that to happen. But the fact is, if that rebuilding is going to be effective, it will be built on an effective aid programme starting now, and for many people that simply does not exist. A former chief constable has told the inquest into the Hillsborough disaster that he regrets saying that Liverpool fans had made the police’sjob much harder than it needed to be. Sir Norman Bettison was a chief inspector with South Yorkshire Police when the tragedy happened in 1989, asjudith Moritz reports from the inquest in Warrington. Accused of being at the heart of the police cover-up, Sir Norman Bettison says he’s been at the centre of a firestorm. Today he spoke of his regret at the way he’s handled things. In September 2012 the Hillsborough Independent Panel published its report into the disaster in which 96 Liverpool supporters were fatally crushed. Sir Norman, who was Chief Constable of West Yorkshire at the time, reacted by saying the fans’ behaviour at Hillsborough had made the police’s job harder than it needed to be. He later apologised. Today, sitting in the witness box, yards from the bereaved families who he had offended, he said he regretted making the remarks in the way he had. After the report was published, Sir Norman said he had found him self at the front and centre of the very serious allegation of a cover-up, and of putting the blame on the Liverpool fans for causing the deaths of 96 innocent people. He acknowledged that the remarks had been hurried and ill thought through, and that they had caused a firestorm. Sir Norman maintained that he did not have a major role in South Yorkshire Police’s response to Hillsborough. Next week he will be questioned by lawyers for the bereaved families. judith Moritz, BBC News, Warrington. Prosecutors in the US city of Baltimore have charged six police officers with murder, assault and illegal arrest, following the death of a young black man. Freddie Gray suffered severe spinal injuries after his arrest last month. His death led to violent protests. A lawyer for the police union said they had nothing-- done nothing wrong and they would be vindicated. Tonight, President Obama said the truth about what happened must be uncovered. From Baltimore, Aleem Maqbool reports. justice for Freddie. For so many, a cloud has been lifted. They had been demanding justice for Freddie Gray, but given what has happened before in cases involving black men and the police in America, they really didn’t expect this. The findings of our comprehensive, thorough and independent investigation, coupled with the medical examiner’s determination that Mr Gray’s death was a homicide, which we received today, has led us to believe that we have probable cause to file criminal charges. This is Freddie Gray, screaming as he is dragged to a police van. He later died with a broken neck. The prosecutor now says there were no grounds to detain him, and the six officers face charges of assault, negligence, manslaughter and murder. So much tension on the streets here since the death of Freddie Gray has now been replaced by celebration. And after so much despair, people here finally feel some sense of hope. We good now. That’s all we wanted, our voice to be heard. It’s like a big relief. We’ve been oppressed so long. It’s not really a black, white thing, more the police versus everybody. Injubilant mood, even two of the most notorious gang leaders came together, saying their rivalry has been buried. This right here was an eye-opener, so from now on, this right here is dead, man. While none of the officers has yet been found guilty, this is still a huge moment for those who for months have taken to the streets in anger across this country. But there is a long way to go to resolve the issues around race and policing in America. Aleem Maqbool, BBC News, Baltimore. A brief look at some of the day’s other stories now. It’s understood a ""full file"" of further allegations against the entertainer Rolf Harris has been given to the Crown Prosecution Service. Harris was jailed for six years for a string of indecent assaults on girls and young women. The American electric car maker Tesla has launched a domestic rechargeable battery which can store electricity from solar panels. The firm says it could revolutionise home electricity supplies, with households no longer needing to rely on the National Grid. Critics say the cost will need to come down before the product has mass appeal. The American soul singer Ben E King, best known for the hit song Stand By Me, has died at the age of 76. He originally found fame with The Drifters, before quitting the group in 1960. After going solo, he hit the US top five the following year with Stand By Me. With a staggering $300 million at stake, one of the most hyped boxing matches ever takes place in Las Vegas this weekend. After years of backroom negotiations, Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao will fight each other for the first time. Dan Roan is in Las Vegas. Millions are won and lost every day here in Las Vegas, but this weekend it is boxing that is giving the city its biggest payday. Although, with just 500 tickets available to the general public, very few are lucky enough to hit the jackpot. You have tickets, I see. Yes, I am very excited about the fight. History in the making. I can’t wait. How much did they cost you? They cost $5,500. Are you going to keep hold of them, sell them on? I would take $10,000 and sell them. As Vegas gears up for fight night, others are not so fortunate, despite having come halfway round the world. We spent $1+00 just to watch it on TV in a hotel. It’s a lot of money, isn’t it? This is the ring which will host the richest fight in boxing history. This arena holds 16,500 seats. Some tickets are being sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars. That’s how much some people want to witness one of the biggest events of the sporting year. It’s time... The bout brings together the two defining fighters of their generation, Filipino Manny Pacquiao, and Floyd Mayweather, the unbeaten American, the pair sharing an estimated $500 million, thanks to pay-per-view. Has he found the range? Yes, he did! In 1985, during boxing’s heyday, 19 million British television viewers watched Barry McGuigan become world champion, but even he is surprised at this level of hype. This is the biggest fight in probably 35 years. Because these guys are so iconic and enormous. Forget Formula One, forget the Champions League final, forget all of that. This is the biggest sporting event of all time. After years of negotiations, Mayweather and Pacquiao are finally about to go toe to toe. We are about to discover if it was worth the wait. In the next few minutes, the boxers will arrive here for the official weigh in, and for the first time in modern boxing, fans have paid for the privilege of being here, which has not stopped 16,000 from coming, a sign of how much pent-up demand varies to watch the most lucrative bout boxing has ever seen. -- varies to watch the most lucrative bout boxing has ever seen. -- there is. Back to the election now, and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg might be fighting for his political life, as the latest polling suggests he’s narrowly trailing Labour for his seat of Sheffield Hallam. In the latest of our constituency profiles, Chris Buckler is there and joins us now. Here at the University of Sheffield there are many posters calling for students to vote, and also for free education. It will come as no surprise that in the city that elected Nick Clegg in 2010, the issue of tuition fees does come up on the doorsteps. This week, an opinion poll commissioned by Lord Ashcroft indicated Labour were one percentage point ahead in this constituency, but the Lib Dems were closing the gap and there are indications that is because some former Conservative voters are lending support to the Deputy Prime Minister. In Sheffield, big names are involved in a battle with reputation and pride on the line. But it’s not just at the World Snooker Championships inside the Crucible where they are feeling the heat. He may hold the title of Deputy Prime Minister, but Nick Clegg is having to campaign hard to keep his seat in the Commons. And perhaps it is a sign of these coalition times that some Conservative commentators have joined those cheerleading for Mr Clegg to win here at least. I don’t think I’m asking the Tories to cheerlead. Tories, indeed people of all parties, can say what they like. If they want to say nice things about Liberal Democrats, that’s fine. What is emerging in this debate, which is perhaps reflected in some of the commentary, is that everybody has realised no one is going to win. That means coalition government. But the Liberal Democrats need to be confident of winning enough seats to have a real influence. Much of Sheffield Hallam is pretty prosperous. It reaches into the countryside surrounding the city. But there are also student areas in this constituency, and many of the voters here haven’t forgotten the broken promise to get rid of tuition fees at the last election. Students were hurt so badly because Cleggmania was based around galvanising students. That frustration could give another party an opportunity to break through. In this constituency in 2010, the Liberal Democrats were sitting in first place, with the Conservatives second. But Labour think they can knock them both out of the way and take the seat. It’s about trust and integrity, and about standing in this community now, before this election, and saying, this is what I will do. That sounds like a dig at Nick Clegg. No. It is aboutjudgement. just as the Lib Dems are facing questions about their time sharing power with the Conservatives, the Tory candidate is having to address his own share of coalition concerns. We must get out of Europe, whatever else happens. This is the one big thing that Cameron has. He has promised the referendum. We don’t want the Lib Dems to scupper it again. Although, with leaflets in Tory blue, he seems to think Nick Clegg is trying to steal some Conservative colours. They are absolutely petrified they are going to lose Hallam. I have heard talk in the Commons tearoom that Nick Clegg is toast. The question is, who is going to be the toaster, Labour or the Conservatives? As the final vote approaches, the Deputy Prime Minister knows he is still involved in two contests. One, a national campaign. And the second, a fight for his seat. And the polls suggest there is still everything to play for. Chris Buckler, BBC News, Sheffield. And in total there are eight candidates standing for election in the constituency of Sheffield Hallam next week. Throughout the election campaign we’ve been hearing from voters from across the UK about their concerns. Tonight we’re with Carwyn james, a 22-year-old young farmer, born and raised on his family farm in Pembrokeshire. My name is Carwyn james. I’m a Pembrokeshire young farmer, born and raised on the family farm. I’m 22 years old. Agriculture is becoming more and more business focused and more commercial. And it is losing the family aspect of it. My father died when I was two, and then at the age of 12, Mam developed rheumatoid arthritis symptoms. From 12 to 18, we were young carers and trying to juggle the farm as well with school. Things are a lot easier now that we’ve received 2lI-hour social care. We can lead much more independent lives now and it’s transformed our life. These are our suckler cows. What matters to me is the economy. Farming accounts for around 7% of the economy in the UK and I think it should be taken more seriously. Employing young people in the countryside should be at the heart of the government’s agenda. I think we need a strong rural economy to support the rest of the economy. And we need to protect our rural economy here in the UK. That was Carwyn james from Pembrokeshire. That’s all from us. Now, time for the news where you are. Good evening and welcome, I’m Alice Bhandhukravi. A minute’s silence was held in Whitehall today to remember young victims of gun and knife crime. It was organised by the father of Kiyan Prince - an aspiring footballer, who was stabbed to death outside his school at the age of 15. Ayshea Buksh was there. # Amazing Grace #. It was a morning of song and solemnity. Young people remembered by those who loved them. Families and friends joined youth groups and charities opposite Downing Street for a unique event. The project was inspired by the family of Kiyan Prince, an aspiring young footballer, who was murdered outside his school in Edgware nine years ago. It’s so easy for us to forget these young lives and just to get on with our lives and forget that these young people have got families and there’s so much pain within the crowd. A minute’s silence was also held in some schools and colleges in London and Manchester. The list of young people killed in the UK over the past ten years is over 400 and growing. I was creating a banner with the numbers and it’s increasing every day. Every day, I have to change it. How long are we going to do this for? just last night a teenager was stabbed in Paddington and has suffered what police described as life changing injuries. Robyn Travis was once involved in turf wars in Hackney and Tottenham and knows all too well how fights escalate. I had a few fights when I was younger, then a few people started to use weapons so I decided my next thing was to use weapons as well, so I became a prisoner to that mentality. Overall today’s vigil offered comfort and support. It’s strengthened us and given us an aspiration that yes, what we are doing is powerful and what we’re doing is having a positive effect. This event may now be coming to an end but it’s hoped the sentiment created here will translate into action and just like the balloons that were released, that sentiment will travel to other parts of the UK. Police are investigating new allegations of electoral fraud following last week’s High Courtjudgement which forced the Mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, to step down. Five new allegations, which had not been previously reported to police, have been identified within a High Court report. Four of those are now being assessed to see if a criminal investigation should be carried out.

More delays for rail commuters this morning, as it’s revealed last weeks chaos at Clapham junction was caused by an engineering error. And Kate will have the forecast. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. The party leaders will make their final arguments on the last day of campaigning of one of the tightest and most unpredictable elections of recent times. With most opinion polls suggesting the Conservatives and Labour are neck-and-neck, there are signs the parties are assessing their options should there be no overall winner. A moment we will hear from our correspondents with the Labour team, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP and Ukip. But first, David Cameron says the election would go right down to the wire, our correspondent Carole Walker is travelling with him. Yes, thank you. We are some 28 hours into this final round-the-clock, almost nonstop phase of the campaign. We are at Chester zoo where they are building a new visitor attraction, it is the latest phase on what has been a pretty exhausting final phase. This week... just a few hours of this campaign left, and David Cameron is using every last moment to try to win over undecided voters. At midnight he was chatting to night shift worker, at a huge supermarket depot near Bristol. In another of the key marginal seat, which will determine the outcome of this election. There is no sign of the late breakthrough the Conservatives had hoped for, but they haven’t given up trying. By early this morning David Cameron was at a remote farm in the Brecon Beacons for a chat with local farmers. He talked to them about bovine TB and rural broadband. But did not want to talk to us about what he will do if no party wins an overall majority as the polls suggest, though he did say he would act in the national interest. It is obviously a close contest, it is going to go right down to the wire. Think people are taking time to decide because it is such an important election, but I am going to spend the next few hours campaigning with everything I have got to shape that outcome, because people can still choose and I will talk about the results when it is all over. Will this final drive for votes make any difference? David Cameron stepped up the tempo and the passion in his campaign over the final week, passion in his campaign over the finalweek, he can’t passion in his campaign over the final week, he can’t afford any let UP final week, he can’t afford any let up on the eve of polling day. This morning he dropped in on mothers and baby, at a childcare centre in Cannock. Mr Cameron’s promising more free childcare if he is elected. That is an emmen, thank you very much. At every stop David Cameron talks of the upturn in the economy. His promise of more jobs and lower taxes, and the risks that would be posed, if any of his rivals took count in the struggle to form our next Government. You heard David Cameron acknowledging there just keep talking about the battle outright. He is determined to try to convince voters even at this late stage, that it is in their interests to vote for a majority Conservative Government. But he knows now how difficult that is looking. He also talked the today about the fact he would always act in the national interest. That perhaps could be a hint that he is preparing, thinking about some form of coalition or loser agreement if he is to form a government. What he is trying to do though, now, is to win every possible vote and every possible seat, particularly those marginal seats that he is focussing on as he seeks to claim the democratic mandate to form the next Government. Ed Miliband says he’s optimistic about Labour’s chances, and he trusts the public to make the ""rightjudgement"". Our correspondent Iain Watson is in Pendle. That is right. Specifically in East Lancashire and Ed Miliband hasjust left, to drive through the driving rain, to similar seatsjust left, to drive through the driving rain, to similar seats just across the Pennines in West Yorkshire. He isn’t rampaging round the country, he isn’t campaigning all through the night, instead he is targeting a few marginals because he says that his message matters a lot more than the mileage. This is a territory where elections can be won or lost. Marginal seats either side of England’s spine. Ed Miliband’s crossing the Pennines in search of votes. This morning he was delivering a stark message. This is the clearest choice that has been put before the British people for a generation. Between a Tory Government, that works only for the privileged few, or a Labour Government that will put working families first. To emphasise this point he said as Prime Minister he wouldn’t compromise on getting rid of the special tax status for wealthy foreign residents The next Labour Government will do what no Government has done for 200 year, we will establish non-dom status. But polls suggest some voters as well as some of the media have doubts of whether he deserves to be in Downing Street. Some newspapers have never been keen on you, let’s face it. Some others say you are not ready to be Prime Minister. Are you ready to be Prime Minister? Yes, and in the final hours of this campaign, Ian, I am going to focus on the thing that matters more than anything. And that is the British people. And the huge choice they have before them. It has been a long campaign and there isn’t much evidence that any of the major parties have moved opinion in their favour, now, nobody round Ed Miliband believes he can win an overall majority tomorrow but they believe if he can get one or two seats more than the Conservatives in Parliament, they think it is inevitable he will installed in Downing Street as Prime Minister. It is an uphill battle getting people to the polling stations this is why Ed Miliband’s targeting a few suits which could decide whether he is in Government or remains in opposition. -- seats. You saw me ask a few minutes ago is he ready to be Prime Minister? He answered that question, but I also sct him could a runner-up be put? Would that be legitimate? He completely side stepped that question, entirely. It’s a question he wants to avoid by coming first after tomorrow’s poll, but he and the people round him know it is absolutely on a knife-edge. Nick Clegg, who set off from Land’s End yesterday, is heading tojohn o’ Groats, through Scottish constituencies his party is fighting to retain. Our correspondent Kamal Ahmed is travelling with him. Yes, Simon, we are going through the Scottish countryside. Nick Clegg arrived in Scotland half way through day two of this epic travel from Land’s End tojohn o’ Groats, over 1,000 miles visiting all sorts of Liberal Democrats, constituencies. A bit of a lie in, this morning he started at 6am, so a bit more sieve lied. He started at a bakery in the Lake District. -- civilised. Mmmm! Insisting he is sniffing out success, Nick Clegg launched the final day of campaigning at a bakery in the Lake District. He was with Tim Farron, that somewhat undangered species - a Liberal Democrat MP with a rock solid seat. Mr Clegg said that the Liberal Democrats would do better than expected, even if that did mean losing up to half of their MPs. The decision that people have to take tomorrow is the biggest political decision of their lives and the Liberal Democrats are a party that would give a brain and a heart to any government. We would balance the books fairly, but cut taxes for working people, put money in your schools and hospitals and end pay cuts for public sector workers. At this bakery in the Lake District, Nick Clegg has been laying out the price of coalition with the Liberal Democrats in terms of pledges on education, the NHS and public sector workers. That’s the price he will charge if any party wants coalition with him on May 8th. Labour and the Conservatives are starting to lay out their own red lines on any future coalition deal. Would Mr Clegg give ground? I’m not going to provide a running commentary on other parties’ red lines. All I’m saying is the Liberal Democrats have a series of red lines which - unlike the Conservatives and the Labour Party’s - strike the right balance between doing what is needed to balance the books, but to so fairly. The beautiful Lakes may be safe for the Liberal Democrats, how true that is for the other 55 seats will be revealed after the close of the polls tomorrow. So for Nick message, will it voters? He says that will allow Labour to be economically disciplined to do. He hopes that message is getting through to the voters for tomorrow’s big poll. One of the most remarkable campaign battles has been in Scotland, where the SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon is hoping a strong performance in the opinion polls will translate into Ao or even 50 MPs for her party. Our Scotland correspondent Laura Bicker sent this report. This is the final message of an extraordinary campaign and some have come a long way to hear it. You walked from Southampton? Yes. You’re kidding me. I think that deserves a photo. As she made her way to a platform in the centre of Edinburgh, a place known as the Mound, this First Minister delivered her last election sermon. Tomorrow is an opportunity for us to come together to unite as one country, to unite and link arms as one Scotland and vote SNP to make our voice heard. Thank you very much. Thousands of supporters have cheered Nicola Sturgeon throughout her tour of Scotland, no request for a selfie is ever denied. It is a party in a buoyant mood. Nicola Sturgeon is not even standing in this election, but she could be on course to lead her party into an historic general election. The party has six seats in Westminster currently. They have never won more than 11, but the polls suggest that could win the majority of seats in Scotland. Labour say backing the SNP is a gamble. That it could help herald another five years of Conservative-led government. Nicola Sturgeon said she will try to ensure that does not happen. If there is an anti-Tory majority on Friday morning, then the parties that make up that anti-Tory majority should work together to get the Tories out, but then make sure the Tories are replaced with something better and bolder and more progressive and that is the influence I want the SNP to have. The votes in Scotland have yet to be cast and counted, but the new politics of this country could soon affect the whole of the UK. Nigel Farage will travel to the Thanet South constituency in Kent on the final day of campaigning, having said he’ll resign as UKIP’s leader if he doesn’t win the seat. ~ Iam I am feeling ship shape. Nigel Farage has led Ukip to victory in the European election, he believes that momentum will carry them to their best result in a general election. If we get Ukip voices in the House of Commons we will represent the majority view on many issue, and every vote for Ukip is a vote for changing British politics and goodness me it needs it. Ukip’s popularity has grown over the last few years and the polls are suggesting that up to 14% of people will vote for them tomorrow. Base that on the number of people who voted in the last general election, and that means up to four million people could put an E in the name of their Ukip candidate. Nigel Farage appeared to be not put too far off his stride. We have had our problem, we have had fewer than most. And so he carried on meeting people both for and against he carried on meeting people both forand against him. for and against him. What have I done now? I am discriminatory, sexist, I was a banker. You were a stockbroker. Some of them ended up arguing between themselves. Would you like to meet Nigel? Meanwhile Ukip’s talisman told us he thinks they are going to do better than pollsters think because some voters won’t admit they are Ukipers This phenomenon of the shy kipper is true. They won’t tell people they are going to vote Ukip. I think tomorrow they are. How many seats in Parliament will all this give Ukip? Not many suggest the polls. Expect to hear a lot from them about electoral reform. The Green party leader, Natalie Bennett, will address supporters in Bristol West- a key target for them. She urged voters to vote for what they believe in. People are telling me they’re actually going to decide when they have got the pencil in their hand. So these last few hours are important for us to send a very clear message that the Green Party is the offering a real change - a change from business as usual politics, offering a politics built on values, on principles and saying to people, vote for what you believe in. The Plaid Cymru leader, Leanne Wood, will be in Carmarthen where her party’s first MP was elected 49 years ago. She said Wales has the chance to be at the centre of the UK agenda, and was confident the party could increase the number of MPs in Westminster. ~ I think that Plaid Cymru is in the position, the strongest position that we have eever been, to have our best ever Westminster election result, and Ijust ask people to consider in the final 24 hours, if they haven’t made up their minds, who is the best placed to fight for their local community, and to fight to the best interest of Wales, and it is undoubtedly a Plaid Cymru candidate in this election. Norman Smith is in Westminster. All trying to sway the undecided voters. If you have the joy of doing the London Marathon, you will know that when you come down the embankment, you see Big Ben in front of you and you breathe a sigh of relief because he was there above all the voters, there is a sense of relief that after the longest campaign ever, we defeat confuse you to the fact elections in living memory. We may coalition system where we do not end up with one party having the majority rule. If the SNP do as well as expected, although Nicola Sturgeon said it is not about independence, to not be surprised if that dramatically accelerates another independence referendum and if David Cameron wins, that brings forward the prospect of a vote on our place in Europe. This is a truly huge election which could change not just the constitution but our country. My advice to voters, clear the sofa, silence the dog, switch on the telly, fasten your seat belt, it will be a big one. Norman, thank you. We will have more on the election later on in the programme but you can find out about all the party’s policies by going to our website. Our top story this lunchtime. The final 24 hours of campaigning before Britain goes to the polls in the tightest election for decades. And still to come, the remarkable story of the young boy who refused to give up on his sister who disappeared in the Nepal earthquake. Coming up in sport, Gareth Bale’s agent hits back at criticism the real Madrid forward received following his side’s defeat. He made fewer passes than the Real Madrid keeper. French investigators have found that the co-pilot suspected of deliberately crashing a Germanwings flight into the French Alps in March may have rehearsed the manouevre. An interim report on the disaster data from the flight recorder shows that Andreas Lubitz repeatedly set the plane’s computer into a simulated descent, then brought it back up again, on a flight on the same A320 jet on the outward flight. Our transport correspondent Richard Westcott reports. Another chilling detail out of this disaster. New evidence that the co-pilot practised his fatal dive that killed 150 people on this mountainside. It happened on a flight to Spain earlier the same day. This is Andreas Lubitz, the man at the controls. Left alone in the cockpit, he spent five minutes playing with the computer. Asked to descend by Air Traffic Control, he would have turned a dial like this one. The report says he put in the extreme heights, from as low as 100 feet to as high as 49,000 feet. He did something similar on the plane that he crashed. Butjust turning the style would not lead to dramatic changes on board. The captain and passengers in the back would not have noticed any difference. Investigators have now built a picture of what happened on board the Germanwings flight. This is the actual plane, filmed earlier this year. The co-pilot, with mental health problems, locked his captain out of the cockpit and deliberately flew into the side of a mountain. The agony goes on for the families of those on board. They know what Andreas Lubitz did but they may never know why. The supermarket group Sainsbury’s has reported a loss of £72 million for the year to March - its first for a decade. The company’s results were hit by a number of one-off costs, including a write down in the value of some of its stores. Our business correspondent john Moylan reports. The clouds are gathering over Sainsburys. After years of growth, it has now plunged into the red for the first time in a decade. It has now plunged into the red for the first time in a decade. The boss of Britain’s third biggest supermarket chain told me that it is weathering the storm but it is not immune to theissues the storm but it is not immune to the issues facing the industry. It is very tough. It has been the toughest market I have seen in 30 years in the industry. I have seen a lot of things. We have a series of different facts, customers shopping more frequently and when they shop they buy less. Most importantly, we are seeing deflation for the first time in 30 years. In the year to March, underlying profits fell to £681 million, down almost 15%. But costs soared to £753 million, hit by plunging property values. That resulted in an overall loss of £72 million, its first since 2005. Sainsbury’s is being squeezed on all sides. It has been undercut by discount retailers, and it is also fighting for market share against bigger rivals like Tesco and more upmarket brands like Waitrose. Like its rivals, it is cutting prices. And reworking its bigger stores. It has also expanded online, adding more convenience stores on the high streets. But is that enough? Sainsbury’s is in a tricky situation. The price borers are having an adverse impact on the profitability margins. This will become more critical as Usher Hall -- shareholders are looking for more return on investments. 25 million people shop at Sainsbury’s every week but it is losing market share with challenging conditions ahead. The big question is whether Sainsbury’s can find its way. A teenage boy has been has been given a two year youth detention order for attacking a woman who then wrote an open letter about her ordeal - which received national news coverage. The 17 year-old, who can’t be named for legal reasons, assaulted the 20 year-old Oxford student as she walked home from a night out You did notjust attacked me that night. It was a daughter which Ioni Wells said took only ten minutes to write but it has resonated beyond the student paper for which it was written. She was attacked just after midnight, having caught the last tube. She was almost home when she was forced to the ground, her head smashed against the payment, her brother ripped apart. -- smashed against the payment, her brother ripped apart. -- her bra. I can close my eyes without hearing my attacker’s footsteps behind me, I feel insecure about myself. I can’t look at my own body without thinking how my attacker hit me so hard I bled. My body feels tainted and violated by a stranger who thought he had the right to violate my body. The districtjudge was he had the right to violate my body. The district judge was told that the youth who attacked a lone had offered no explanation for his actions. The only word he could find to describe how he felt about it were bad, not good. It was sentenced to 290 years, the maximum available. Whereas Ione’s original letter sounded defiant, today her psychological trauma was laid bare. Both are an insight into the devastating and long-lasting effects of sexual assault. Newsjustin devastating and long-lasting effects of sexual assault. News justin and Scotland Yard says that counterterrorism police investigating fraud allegations linked to extremists in Syria have arrested seven men. That newsjust reaching us. More now on the election. As we have heard, it is one of the most tight and unpredictable. That is crossed to the campaign hub, where critters -- Christian Fraser is looking at how things might play out. A reminderthat things might play out. A reminder that the UK will be voting in 650 constituencies from tomorrow morning. Each one of those highlighted by a dot on the map. The party that once a majority needs 326 seats in all, that is the magic number. But what if there is not a decisive result? Well, the Prime Minister would remain decisive result? Well, the Prime Ministerwould remain in Minister would remain in office in the interim and he would get the first chance to form a new government. In 2010, it took five days of meetings between the three parties to find a solution. It could take longer this time. It could take several weeks. There are more parties involved. Maybe there is now, nation of two main parties that can form the majority. But in the minds of the politicians there is a calendar of events that will define the process, starting with the 18th of May when Parliament returns. New MPs will be sworn in and the Speaker elected. On the 27th of May, a new government would put forward its legislative programme delivered by the Queen at the State opening of Parliament. It is not until the first week ofjune that the government’s first test of authority will come. If the Queen’s Speech is voted down, quickly afterwards there will be a motion of no confidence in the new government and the Prime Minister. At that point, the leader of the opposition would get 14 days to form a new government to win the Commons’ support. If no government emerges after this process, heaven forbid, are you ready for this, a new election perhaps as early as july? Lets not go there. But there is a calendar of events, though complicated by the politics. Isn’t it always? Already the various parties have been putting arguments for forwards about what constitutes a legitimate government. The Conservatives say it is the party with the most seats but some on the Labour side say that legitimacy flows from control of the Commons. The Liberal Democrats say that they will give time and space for the party with the biggest mandate. The SNP says that it would be illegitimate to ignore the will of the Scottish people. So who is right? Constitutional experts tell you that it is the man at the head of the party that controls the Commons that ultimately controls the country. But we cannot be completely sure what will happen next. With those predictions that this will be one of the course of the closest elections ever, all eyes are on the undecided voters in marginal constituencies. One of the tightest of those is doubly. Our correspondent has been speaking to constituents there. Dudley North, where Labour’s defending a slim majority from the Conservatives. It’s yet another key battleground. Voters face confusing choices about which direction to take. A year or so ago the campaign here in Dudley North would have been regarded as a straight two-way battle between Labour and the Conservatives. But here in the Black Country in the West Midlands, Ukip has been polling strongly and one of the great unknowns in marginals is how will the other parties do and from whom will they take their votes? The town’s suffered badly in the recession, but the economy is on the up and that could influence tomorrow’s vote. It definitely will do. People want to work and just move on, we want to see change. I believe that’s the way people in business as well want to turn the corner and stay turning the corner. They’re still weighing up the options, but there are other major issues on voters’ minds. Immigration, we are a small island, we can’t take everybody. I know it’s a shame for a lot of people and they need help and that, but I think they should do something about... They should start doing something in their country where they’re trying to flee. Putting the country right, making a future for the kids. I have got no faith in not one of them. Are you going to vote? To be honest it’s a shame not to, but I don’t think I will. One thing all the parties will want to persuade to people to go to polls - better weather. And these are all the candidates standing in Dudley North for the General Election. Let’s get a final thought on all this from our Assistant Political Editor, Norman Smith. The end of a long campaign and the start of something totally unpredictable. It is the end of a very long campaign. And it seems that there is a curiosity about this campaign. It has been going on for months and bluntly, nothing has changed. We are still, just one day before people go to vote, and the two main parties are absolutely neck and neck. Nothing has made a blind bit of difference. And I think the reason for that is that this has also been one of the most tightly controlled election campaigns that I can remember. There has been a determination by the party machine to avoid any sort of mishap, anything like the Gordon Brown moment with Gillian Duffie in the last election. As a consequence, the public has almost been removed from the contest. The party leaders have been distant from the electorate and the only time, really, that this election burst into life, was last week when we had that Question Time debate on the television and a good old Yorkshire audience got to grips with the party leaders, shook them by the lapels and ask them direct, hard questions. And the party leaders responded much better. They suddenly came out of themselves and presented themselves in a more effective light. It seems to me that the challenge for our political system and political leaders, if we have another general election, is to find a way of being less buttoned up about elections and hopefully that way, engage more voters. Norman Smith, thank you. You’re watching the BBC News at One. Our top story today, the last 24 hours of campaigning before Britain goes to the polls in the tightest election for decades. In a moment, we’ll have the full national weather forecast, plus the news where you are. But first with more on Gareth Bale who’s come under fire at Real Madrid and all the rest of the day’s sport, here’s Katie Gornall at the BBC Sports Centre. Gareth Bale has come under fire for his performance for Real Madrid during last night’s 2-1 defeat to juventus in the Champions League. Former Manchester United captain Roy Keane said Bale gave nothing in the match. He had fewer touches than the keeper. But Bale’s agentjonathan Barnett hit back, saying he doesn’t pay attention to people who have failed in management. Despite going into last night’s game in Turin as underdogs, juventus beat the defending champions thanks to Carlos Tevez’s second half penalty. The second leg is a week today. Tonight Barcelona host Bayern Munich. There’s been turmoil for Newcastle United both on and off the pitch this season. Now their captain Fabricio Coloccini has written an open letter to the club’s fans, calling for them to pull together as they battle to stay in the Premier League. Here’s Richard Conway. Fans have seen enough this season. Their anger Fans have seen enough this season. Theiranger has Their anger has resurfaced with the team embroiled in a Premier League investigation fight and with accusation the club is devoid of ambition under Mike Ashley. For managerjohn carver his dream job has turned into a nightmare. Has overseen eight defeats in a row and accused one of his players being deliberately sent off I spoke to Williamson at half-time and said a few choice word. I thought he has done that on purpose. He has a two match ban, we only have three games left. Is it an easy way out. The team turned to Steve McClaren to save their season but he rejected the opportunity. Newcastle play West Brom knowing they must reverse their form. Their captain has issued a rallying cry to fans saying players and staff have come together to leave all past problems aside. The question now is can they deliver on that assurance and win? With Newcastle rolling from crisis to crisis in recent years fans are yearning for stability and a want their team to start living up to their name by being united. Meanwhile the headquarters of Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct empire in Derbyshire have been searched by police investigating recent takeovers at Glasgow Rangers. The Newcastle owner has a 9% stake in the Ibrox club and has control of the club’s retail operations. The ongoing investigation has already led to the arrest of the former Rangers owner Craig Whyte. Former England cricket captain Andrew Strauss looks set to be appointed the ECB’s new director of cricket. If as expected he takes the role, he’ll have a number of tough decisions to make ahead of the first test against New Zealand. Our correspondent joe Wilson reports from Lords. Ina In a fortnight’s time the seats will be full. Corks will be popping an people will be paying some atonnion to the first Test match of the English summer. By this end of this week Andrew Strauss will be in his position as the ECB’s new director, that seems certain, but what will hisjob involve? He isroom calm, diplomatic but ambitious, he could have been on the campaign trail this week looking for election to Parliament! Sure he will have influence on who coaches the team but he will want some say in who plays for them as well. New Zealand’s cricketers have been here continuing their build up to the first Test match. England will be playing a one day international in Ireland. The schedule is relentless. Strauss’s role may be looking to long-term planning for English cricket but the way the schedule is long-term planning for England normally means what will happen next week. That’s all sport for now. Back to you Simon. It’s eleven days since the Earthquake which devastated many parts of Nepal, killing more than 7,500 people and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless. But since then, there’ve been many remarkable stories of survival and rescue. Nangsal Tamang is a twelve year old girl who disappeared on the day the earthquake struck. For days after, her brother, Sonam Tashi Tamang, searched relentlessly for her. On the fifth day we went looking for her again. We finally found her in an unconscious state. Her left hand and leg were not moving.. We fete her some food and carried her up to the place where we could get a bus. The arm yes personnel caused an ambulance and took her to hospital. The doctors there said they could not treat her, so she was taken to the Israeli hospital. She has a severe head trauma with bleeding, inside her head. They treated her, she was ventilated and was ICU for a few days and she is just getting better from day-to-day. few days and she is just getting betterfrom day-to-day. It isjust makele. I am amazed, seeing her. betterfrom day-to-day. It isjust makele. Iam amazed, seeing her. -- a miracle. Now her condition has improved significantly. My sister can talk and move her hands and legs. She says she doesn’t remember anything about the time she was in the forest after the rock hit her. I am hopeful she will recover fully. More than £41 million has now been donated so far by the British public to the Disasters and Emergency Committee’s earthquake appeal. The appeal was launched eight days ago. Time for a look at the weather. Yesterday we had stormy seas in Cornwall, we had this picture sent to us. Strong winds out there today and they lasted into yesterday evening. Isle of Wight saw gusts of 68mph. This morning we have beaten that as well. Strong winds out there as the moment. Gusty winds in the southern half of the UK, some heavy rain and showers, so another unsettled day, with still that area of low pressure sitting across Scotland. We will continue to see the showers moving across the country through the afternoon. Keeping things cloudy, across northern Scotland, with further outbreaks of rain. I think the showers starting to ease further south across Scotland. Temperatures in Glasgow reaching highs of 11 degrees. For Northern Ireland we have a few showers scattered round. Drier spells in between but feeling cool at nine to ten. Showers in England and Wales could be on the heavy side, we will see something a bit drier and brighter in between. Perhaps starting to become a bit more scattered through the next couple of hours but temperatures disappointing, certainly when we add on the downpours and the strong winds. Even into the afternoon across southern England, parts of Wales there will be gusts round the coast we could reach 60mph. But they will start to fall lighter, through the night tonight. The isobars opening out. We have a low pressure system clearing to the north of Scotland. Notjust lighter winds but fewer showers round as well. The air is cold across Scotland, so a few could be wintry. Temperatures down to two or three degrees. Across Scotland tomorrow windy weather round and we will see some further showers as we go through the day. On balance an improvement tomorrow, there will be a bit more sunshine round, fewer showers and lighter winds. Perhaps a cloud bubbling up into southern England parts of South Wales so we could see the odd shower. Temperatures similar to today, round 10, 14 degree, lighter wind and bit more sunshine. It should feel warmer. A chilly start on Friday to the north. Through the day it looks like the cloud will increase to the west. The risk of rain but for a lot of places Friday should be dry and bright. What about our weekend forecast? Saturday brings our weekend forecast? Saturday brings some showers, parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland on Sunday will see. Some heavy rain. Across England and Wales again, we are starting to pick up the shower, clearing through the day on Saturday, meanwhile on Sunday, drier, and a bit brighter and more significantly warm. It looks like the temperatures will climb and that is signs of things to come. Thank you. You Nowa reminder of our top story this lunchtime... The last 24 hours of campaigning before Britain goes to the polls in the tightest election for decades. And our election results coverage gets underway tomorrow evening at five to ten on BBC One. That’s all from us, now on BBC One it’s time for the news where you are. Have a good afternoon. Welcome to BBC London news. I’m Katharine Carpenter. It’s been revealed that last Thursday’s rail chaos at Clapham junction was caused by a mistake made by engineers carrying out track repairs. 900 passengers had to be led to safety along the rail line. Others were stranded on trains for hours. A formal investigation is underway, but Network Rail says it believes a rail was put back in the wrong position after works the night before. Our transport correspondent Tom Edwards reports. Dire, shambolic. It was getting stir crazy, there was no air conditioning. There has been no commune care, stuck on a train for five hours. Last Thursday was horrendous for thousands of commuters that use Clapham junction, trains couldn’t move, firefighters had to lead passengers down the tracks. And the reason we have now been told engineers made a mistake in replacing the power rail. Melissa was stuck on a train for three-and-a-half hours, she missed an exam, and she will have to pay another £100 to redo it Are you cross about that, frustrated? I am extremely frustrated to know that was an engineering fault, they hadn’t tried and tested the line before we got on the line. That is extremely annoying, and frustrating. I am cross about that. The conductor or third rail powers the training it was removed the night before by Network Rail engineers during track repairs. When they replaced it though, it was in the wrong position, and trains stalled. Network Rail has once again apologised to passenger, and thanked them for their patience, no-one was available for interview though, but in a statement it said it hoped its maintenance teams would learn the lessons, to try and minimise the same thing happening again. This is a latest high profile failure caused by Network Rail. There are now more calls again for significant improvements to the service being provided for the capital’s rail commuters. There was more misery during this morning’s rush hour. Passengers were stuck on services for up to two hours after south-west trains were hit by a signal failure at Serb on the an Waterloo. The company says points were to blame. Detectives investigating the shooting of a cyclist in Bow have renewed their appeal for information on the fourth anniversary of his murder. 42-year-old Wayne Stockdale was riding his bike in Rounton Round when two men armed with handguns opened fire. Police believe he was killed in a case of mistaken identity and there’s a £20,000 reward for information about those responsible. A financial trader accused of contributing to a stock market crash in the US has asked for his £5 million bail condition to be lifted. The Americans claim Navinder Singh Sarao manipulated share prices from his home in Hounslow, and want him extradited to face trial. His lawyer says he can’t pay bail because his assets have been frozen. Now let us look at the weather with Kate. A bluesty weather continues for this afternoon, still a strong southerly breeze pushing the showers through, fairly swiftly, but some of the showersjoining up, so creating a longer spell of rain. But as we head through the afternoon, these showers will break up a little, for some places we could end the day with a bit of sunshine. But the breeze staying with us starts to fall light this evening. Maximum the 15 C, so feeling cool. Like I said the breeze just beginning to ease, as we head through this evening and overnight. It falls lightest still. One or co-showers feeding in from the west. -- one or two. We will get clearer spells with the minimum temperature round seven or eight. Now for tomorrow of course it is election day, it is a drier day, fewer shower, one or two possible but there they will be fairly isolated. Cloud, but that will break. The wind a lot lighter. The maximum temperature up to round 16, 17 C in Central London, so feeling warmer as well. Overnight Thursday into Friday, things clear out of the way so it could be a chilly night. Minimum down to four or five C. Frished -- Minimum down to four or five C. Frished -- Friday it seems like it will stay dry. A lot of cloud owned and we pick up an easterly breeze so it will feel cooler. For Saturday it stays unsettled. We have one or two showers but for Sunday it seems like ",,
21,BBC News 24,6-may-2015,BBC News at Six,18:00,30 mins,True,"After six weeks, it’s nearly over- the party leaders use the last hours to try to win over the electorate. All over the UK they make a final push to get their key messages across before voting starts tomorrow. The three main Westminster party leaders know they face a career-defining election. It’s obviously a close contest. It’s going to go right down to the wire. I think people are taking time to decide because it is such an important election. This is the clearest choice that has been put before the British people for a generation. The Liberal Democrats will be the surprise story of this General Election campaign. But with this most unpredictable of elections, the smaller parties are likely to challenge the usual balance of power at Westminster. Nicola Sturgeon says the SNP is within touching distance of making history at Westminster. Nigel Farage has been campaigning in Thanet as he tries to win his first parliamentary seat.

The final, last-ditch push for votes in the general election is drawing to a close tonight, with the overall outcome as uncertain as when the political campaigning started six weeks ago. The main party leaders are making the most of the few hours they have left to win over the electorate until the polls open at seven o’clock tomorrow morning. David Cameron and Nick Clegg have been making a dash across the UK, while Ed Miliband has been targeting marginal seats in the north of England. We’ll have reports from across the UK. First tonight, Gavin Hewitt, who’s been travelling with the Prime Minister. The final campaign day. For the Tories, it began in a Welsh service area. Then the campaign buses struggled through narrow lanes, their destination a 6:30am visit to a farmer’s Kitchen. A last attempt secure a Welsh marginal. The aim is notjust to have healthy cattle... I put it to David Cameron that a defining feature of the election had been the lack of trust in an additions. I would say that people canjudge a five-year additions. I would say that people can judge a five-year record of inheriting a complete mess from Labour and then creating jobs, turning the economy round, paying the deficit down. I’m not saying we’ve done everything that needs to be done, but we’ve set a strong foundation. During this election, have you had any doubts as to whether in two days you will still be Prime Minister? It is obviously a close contest. It is going to go right down to the wire. So, over a 1300 mile journey, right down to the wire. So, over a 1300 milejourney, his 1300 mile journey, his final pitch came down to this. The country is stronger than it was five years ago, don’t allow others to wreck it. But the polls have barely shifted. David Cameron insists a Conservative victory is within reach, but he is clearly open to the idea of building a second coalition, saying he would always do the right thing for the country. And here is one of the curious features of this very tight campaign. David Cameron is doing all he can to seize back seats from the Liberal Democrats, but come this weekend, he could be looking to them as coalition partners. The Tories are pinning their hopes on people at the last moment voting for what they know rather than gambling on change. But all the indications are that no party will win enough seats for outright victory. So, it has come to this. The final day, the last chance to persuade voters. Starting in Lancashire, where they want the red Rose of Labour to win. The next British Prime Minister, Ed Miliband! By Friday, he could be. Iam not Prime Minister, Ed Miliband! By Friday, he could be. I am not asking you to simply vote for Labour tomorrow. I am asking you to vote for yourself and your family. Above all, I am asking you to vote for a country where we put working families first again. Some people think your policies are too left wing, some people think that you don’t have the right image to be Brown Minister. Why should Ed Miliband be Prime Minister on Friday? Because the British people deserve a country and deserve a Prime Minister who will put working people first. Ed Miliband thinks, hopes, he has done enough, but with Labour set to lose seats in Scotland, he knows it is too close to call. And he still won’t say what will happen on Friday if there is no outright winner. On to Yorkshire, with stops at Tory marginals, Labour not travelling the country. Today, they say is about a message not milage. During this campaign, he stuck to Labour’s core themes, the NHS, banning non-doms, but his policies have attracted attention, and his confidence has grown. justin, do you think you can make Brown Minister? I think he will make a great Prime Minister. But will the voters agree, and give Labour their first election win in a decade? Campaign stable. Find some children and allow a politician to prove they can have fun. To name Nick Clegg rounded off a gruelling campaign. At the beginning of this campaign, we were written off. And yet tomorrow, when the polls close, the Liberal Democrats will be the surprise story of this general election campaign. He was north of the border, crossing Scotland in an attempt to shore rocks struggling Lib Dem support. It is lunchtime, and the Lib Dem battle bus has arrived in Glasgow. It will be crossing the country later today as the Lib Dems fight 11 seats, a lot of them are under threat from the party surging ahead in the polls north of the border, the SNP. At an Inverness distillery, Mr Clegg met one of the big Lib Dem scalps who could fall to the SNP, Danny Alexander. They insisted they could win, which is pretty much what Mr Clegg has been saying in every constituency. This morning he was sniffing at success at a bakery in the Lake District. The decision people have to take tomorrow is the biggest political the season of their lives, and the Liberal Democrats would give a brain and a heart to any government. We would balance the books fairly, cut taxes for working people, put money in schools and hospitals, and end pay cut Looe public sector workers. That has been the Lib Dem offered to voters during this very long campaign. Some are not convinced. Mr Clegg must hope that many more are. As you saw in Kamal Ahmed’s report, this election campaign has seen smaller parties like the SNP challenging the traditional make-up of Westminster. The party leader Nicola Sturgeon says the SNP is within touching distance of making Westminster history. Our correspondent james Cook, is in Edinburgh where this election could mark a transformation for the SNP. Yes, that’s right. Eight months ago, Scotland rejected independence in a referendum. It was a crushing blow for the Scottish National Party, yet since then, it has soared in the polls, and is still way ahead of the Labour Party, making this the most intriguing election anyone here can remember. Is this woman about to change Scotland and Britain forever? Nicola Sturgeon has made the weather in this election, mobbed by media and fans wherever she goes, and she now hopes to reshape the political landscape for good. Tomorrow is an opportunity for us to unite and link arms as one Scotland and vote SNP to make our voice heard. Thank you very much. And that means, for the first time, the SNP changing British economic policy, forcing Labour to increase public spending in return for support at Westminster. On Friday morning, if the voters decide not to give Ed Miliband or David Cameron a majority, they are saying they want different parties to have to work together. My message remains - if there is an anti-Tory majority on Friday morning, the parties that make up that should work together. This could be a watershed election but we will have to wait and see how people vote. So, is this a watershed moment? What do the voters think? I think it is. I think back to the days when they got one or two seats and now there is a huge flood of interest in it, so it could be changing times. Are you happy about that? Reasonably happy. Do you think Scotland is at a turning point in history? I don’t. I think the same grievance culture that drove Labour politics here have been transferred to the SNP, they have outflanked Labour. If the polls are right, street by street, and seat by seat, the SNP are challenging the old order. james Cook, BBC News, Edinburgh. Another party which could make waves at Westminster after tomorrow is Ukip. Their leader, Nigel Farage, has spent his final day campaigning in Kent where he came up against differing shades of opinion. Our Ukip campaign correspondent, Alex Forsyth, has spent the day with him. Are you feeling shipshape? I am feeling shipshape, actually, yes. Despite the long campaign, Nigel Farage kept up his enthusiasm. On a walkabout today, the Ukip leader was intent on proving his credentials as head of the people’s army. Good morning, Nigel. How are you? This has characterised Ukip’s campaign, no battle bus or UK-wide tour, but Nigel Farage on the streets in the key target seats. I think he’s got a lot of charisma. I think he’s got the gift of the gab. But I think a lot of his policies are pie in the sky. Other voters, though, are prepared to stick up for Ukip’s policies, and the party leader isn’t afraid to engage with opponents. What have I done now? Oh, I’m discriminatory, sexist, racist, I was a banker! Was I a banker? No, you were a stockbroker. No, I wasn’t! You haven’t got your facts right, mate! Other leaders might shy away from this kind of confrontation, but this is exactly what Nigel Farage welcomes, the chance to say what others won’t, to take the support and the criticism. Canvassing to the last, the pressure is on for the party expected to deliver its best General Election results. What will success look like to you? Success looks like getting MPs elected, a good number of MPs elected. Success looks like coming third in the national share of the vote. Success looks like winning hundreds of council seats. And to hit that high bar, there is no time for a pint. Are you going to vote for me? Yes. I’ve never voted in my life. It’s the first year I have voted, and I’m Ao this year. Brilliant! Ukip’s focus now is getting its supporters to the ballot box. Alex Forsyth, BBC News. Our deputy political editor, james Landale, is in Downing Street. So, after a very lengthy campaign tomorrow, the voters face a choice of several different parties and very different visions for the future of the UK. Yes, Fiona. As I have gone round the country, many voters have said to me, the politicians are all the same. On one level, they are right. Many are Oxbridge educated political professionals who have spend their lives in and around Westminster. But what I are offering the electric tomorrow is not the same. When people vote tomorrow, they will decide notjust who gets to work in there, but competing visions for the NHS, for the welfare state, for the economy. If we see many more Scottish National Party MPs elected, what will that have on the future of the United Kingdom if Hirscher grows for another referendum. And if the Conservatives are elected, they are promising a referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union. So there are prettyjunky fundamental there are pretty junky fundamental questions. there are prettyjunky fundamental questions. The stakes are incredibly high. james Landale, thank you very much.

It is coming up to a quarter past six. Our top story this evening: Party leaders have spent the final day before tomorrow’s General Election campaigning to to try to win over the electorate. And still to come: Errol Brown, lead singer of the group Later on BBC London. How engineers carrying out track repairs are to blame for last Thursday’s rail chaos at Clapham junction. And could hip hop have influenced music more than the Beatles? One London academic thinks so. And you will have had your tea. East Lothian gets ready to host this summer’s Scottish Open. After intensive political campaigning, just how engaged are you by the election? Polls suggest a large number of people still haven’t decided how they will vote tomorrow. Our correspondent, jon Kay, has been to one seat that’s changed its political colour several times over the last couple of decades - Bristol West - to find out whether all the political pledges, photo opportunities, debates and interviews of the last six weeks have made a difference. In central Bristol, not a battle bus, a Bearrito bus, serving Mexican street view to voters who will head to the polls in a few hours’ time. Have you made your mind up? Not yet. I’ll make my mind up at the ballot box. I’m 95% there. Not quite there. Last minute! The politicians have travelled thousands of miles, targeting constituencies like this which could change their political colour, but has all that campaigning actually got voters on board? I think it has been quite exciting. On a bus tour, we met the Greenwoods, who would have liked less stage management and more street fighting. Do you ever see any Party Leader on his own or very rarely within a public domain taking flak, taking questions? You don’t. It is all choreographed. That gets me! Recent past experiences in past elections have made them a bit worried. I know we are in a different world. Eggs never killed anybody! So how energised are voters after six weeks of electioneering? At this street dance class have they been enraged or engaged by all the different parties? I have been cross more than I have impressed by it. It’s made me look more closely at the different parties and what they offer. Everyone is saying it is close-run, they are very similar. Despite all the leaflets and leader visits here, many said they felt left out, especially younger voters. Boring. Upper middle-class people in suits who don’t have connection with my culture. A giant attempt to mobilise voters here tonight, but some don’t need it. There are big decisions to be made - need it. There are big decisions to be made - Europe, the environment, the economy, the NHS. It is massive, you know. Our final stop, a vintage bus at the city’s museum. As we end ourjourney tonight, two things stick in my mind - ourjourney tonight, two things stick in my mind - first of all, the vast majority of people we have spoken to today say they do intend to vote, but an awful lot of them still haven’t decided who they are voting for. So, election destination unknown! jon Kay, BBC News, Bristol. The Green Party leader, Natalie Bennett, has been campaigning in Bristol West - a key target for them. Eleanor Garnier has been following them and is in Westminster. Ms Bennett has been saying the Greens offer people ""a chance to vote for real change"". That’s right. The party has picked UP That’s right. The party has picked up tens of thousands of new members in the last year. That has fuelled the Green Party campaign. The leader has finished the day here where she’s a candidate, she started off in Bristol West, with a traditional walkabout, street by street, handshake by handshake. As the party has reached these new levels of support, today she promised she would stand up for what mattered. People are telling me they’re actually going to decide when they’ve got the pencil in their hand. So, these last few hours are really important for us to send a very clear message that the Green Party is offering real change, a change from the business of usual politics, offering a politics built on values and principles, and saying to people vote for what you believe in. The Greens are defending Brighton Pavilion, a constituency they expect to win and there would be a bit of relief, too. As forfurther gains, they really would be thrilled, but they are confident that in terms of the number of votes they win, this General Election will give them their best ever result and set them UP their best ever result and set them up for bigger things in 2020. Thank you. The likely closeness of this election means that political parties in Wales and Northern Ireland could have a say in the next Government. In a moment, we’ll speak to Chris Buckler in Belfast, but first our Wales correspondent, Hywel Griffith, is in Cardiff. What has the Plaid leader, Leanne Wood, been saying today? Well, looking at the polls here in Wales, we are not expecting big changes, but in this election, perhaps a handful of MPs would be enough to give any party political clout, that is certainly what Plaid Cymru and Leanne Wood are hoping for. They believe if they were to repeat their 2010 result of three seats, that could win them a seat at any negotiating table come a hung Parliament. Leanne Wood has been given an unprecedented platform in this election, appearing in everything. Earlier on today, I caught up with her at her last rally for this election. We’ve been clear about our priorities. We want to end austerity and we want to win for Wales parity with Scotland in terms of powers and resources. That would deliver an additional £1.2 billion, which would enable us to practically end austerity here in Wales. Well, Plaid Cymru would only do a deal with Labour. Labour so far say they are not interested. They will have to look at how the numbers add up, as I’m sure they will be over in Belfast. It is here at Stormont that Northern Ireland’s main parties have the most influence. Some are beginning to wonder in the event of a tight election, they might have a say at Westminster. There are 18 seats up for grabs here. In 2010, the Democratic Unionist Party won almost half of them. They are prepared to do a deal with Labour or the Conservatives if the deal is right. As for the SDLP, they share much in common with the SNP and Plaid Cymru. However, they are a sister party of Labour’s. As for Sinn Fein, they have spent most of their campaign talking about tackling ""Tory cuts"". However, they don’t take those seats in the British Parliament because they are Irish republicans, but that is important because it changes the arithmetic inside the Commons. It makes it easierfor a Government arithmetic inside the Commons. It makes it easier for a Government to be formed by a party because they need fewer MPs. The Alliance and the Ulster Unionists are vying for seats. I dare say the main parties in London will be watching the results in Northern Ireland a little closer than they usually do. Thank you. Let’s take a brief look at some of the day’s other other news stories: French investigators have found that the co-pilot who’s believed to have deliberately crashed a Germanwings flight into the French Alps in March may have practised the manoeuvre. An interim report on data from the flight recorder shows that earlier that day Andreas Lubitz repeatedly set the plane’s computer into a simulated descent before correcting it. The supermarket group Sainsbury’s has reported a loss of £72 million for the year to March, its first for a decade. The company’s results were hit by a number of one-off costs, including writing off the property value of some of its stores. Errol Brown, lead singer of the group Hot Chocolate, has died aged 71. # I believe in miracles # Where you from # You sexy thing... # The band had a string of hits in the 1970s and ‘80s, including including You Sexy Thing and Everyone’s A Winner. He’d been suffering from liver cancer. In a little over 12 hours, polling stations will open and millions of us will cast our vote. jeremy Vine is at the BBC Election Centre to look at the key battlegrounds - where the election might be won or lost. The map of the 2010 election result shows what a dog-eat-dog battle this may well be, so Scotland, 59 seats, six of them Scottish Nationalists last time, they are attacking the A1 Scottish Labour seats there that you can see in red. Elsewhere, it is very much a battle between Labour and Conservatives. If I bring on the 190 most closely-fought seats, the marginals, you can see in the North West and in the west mid lands, and in South Wales, there are blue seats which Labour want to take off the Conservatives. To offset any losses, the Conservatives are then attacking their own coalition partners, the Liberal Democrats, who are in orange. If I take you into the House of Commons, you can see the result of the last General Election here. Here is our virtual House of Commons. The largest party last time, let’s see them, the Conservatives. 307 seats, but not enough, not the 326 they needed for an overall majority. Labour are some way behind with 258. The Conservatives went into a coalition with the Liberal Democrats, which got them over the line with a majority of 78. Bring on the Other parties, so we fill the House of Commons, so we have the Northern Ireland parties, the Nationalists and so on, then we ask this question: If at the end of this election, either Labour or the Conservatives end up in the position the Conservatives were in last time, with the most number of seats but short of the 326 they need, can they govern? The answer is yes, they can. They have to appeal vote by vote for the support of the parties over here, on the opposition benches. It is difficult stuff. It is tricky Government. It goes measure by measure, week-by-week, day-by-day. measure, week- by-week, day- by-day. They measure, week-by-week, day-by-day. They will be hoping that these parties don’t want to trigger another General Election by bringing the Government down, so, yes, the minority Government is possible after Friday. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Nina Ridge. The last couple of days have been lively to say the least. It is all calming down a bit now. Still some heavy showers currently. They will die down overnight tonight. Still pretty boisterous out there at the moment, some heavy showers across South Wales, South West England, but notice as we go through the night the wind arrows shrink up, the showers will fade away. With clear skies, it will turn a bit chilly, a touch of frost is possible in northern Scotland. In the far north of Scotland, still windy tomorrow with some wet weather. Elsewhere, the winds are a lot lighter, just a few showers scattered about and many places dry with some sunshine. Cloudier at times over Wales, parts of the Midlands and southern counties. And the rain across the far north of Scotland should fade, but it will stay showery and blustery across the Northern Isles. For most of Scotland and Northern Ireland, the winds are a lot lighter, temperatures are far from spectacular, but it will feel warmer with those lighter winds. The same goes across England and Wales. More cloud at time for Wales, the Midlands. In the sunny spell, temperatures will get into the mid to high teens. Still a few showers dotted about during the course of Thursday evening, but for most we go into Friday dry. It will be a cold start. But generally, it is another dry day for many. More cloud at times in the west. For many, dry and temperatures are climbing a little higher again. Into the weekend, the weather continues to chop and change. We are back with blustery showers on Saturday, with some sunshine in between, rain in the North West on Sunday, but elsewhere on Sunday, it looks generally dry with some sunshine and things are starting to warm up as we head into the early part of next week. In a moment, it’ll be time for the news where you are, but as the election campaign draws to a close, let’s just take a look back at the voices and views of the people we’ve spoken to across the country over the last six weeks - and what matters to them. That pumps me up and it is what is changing our country! Am I tough enough? Hell, yes, I’m tough enough! Get out, we don’t want you here! You are better looking in real life! Oh! Do you think the aliens did bring the underpants? It is all talk and they don’t come up with anything to show anything. I have never been interested in politics more than I am now. The time of the politician in the ‘70s saying one thing and doing something else is over. People won’t stand for that. I asked you why I should trust a Chancellor. If he worked in the corporate world he would have been fired... He has destroyed your reputation. Why would we ever believe anything you ever say? That is not a country I want to hand on to my child. They are saying everything we want to hear to get our vote. None of them has ever had to do anything to make them sweat. Happy St George’s Day, everybody! Iwish make them sweat. Happy St George’s Day, everybody! I wish they’ll clear off and let us carry on with business! It will be tight, isn’t it? On the programme tonight. The capital’s election battle grounds. These are the 19 seats to watch as voters head to the polls tomorrow. But in Hackney there are problems for some would be voters. 100 people here won’t be able to vote tomorrow. And it all seems to be down to an admin error. Also tonight. The student who went public about her sexual assault. A teenager is sentenced for attacking her. And a happy homecoming for the new World Snooker Champion. Withjust over 12 hours until the polls open for the General Election, the parties have been doing their last-minute campaigning across the capital. Nationally, the race appears one of the closest in living memory. Here in London, polls have consistently suggested a Labour lead over the Conservatives. That’s despite a booming economy in the capital and a high-profile Conservative Mayor in Borisjohnson. There are 73 seats up for grabs in the capital. Looking at the picture at the last election in 2010, 38 were won by Labour. And 28 seats were won by the Conservatives. And, as for the Liberal Democrats, they took seven. Today the focus is on 19 marginal constituencies, where the current MP could be unseated. On the final day of campaigning, our Political Editor Tim Donovan has been to three of them. The morning after the morning before at the Twickenham garden centre where David Cameron swept in yesterday, beginning his final push, and claiming he can take Lib Dem seats in their stronghold of south-west London like Vince Cable’s. But Vince Cable has been MP for this area for 18 years. He, like other Lib Dems in south-west London, have put down some very deep roots. If you look at how the Tories have been scaling back a lot of their centralised campaign effort, the sort of money you’d expect them to be spending on advertising and mailshots that they are throwing into seats elsewhere, they have in many places been scaling back in south-west London. A long, long campaign is nearly at an end. And some are more decided than others. The austerity versus more spending. It’sjust what is really best and I keep oscillating between Lib Dem for our local area and Conservative and, in my heart of hearts, I’m really a Labour voter, so I’m really stuck. My God, are you going to resolve that in the next few hours? I have to, don’t I? It’s going to have to be a bit tactical, I think, for me. Across London at Elephant and Castle, the demographics are different and so also is the battle. Labour here challenging the Lib Dem who has represented the area for 32 years. Simon Hughes is facing the biggest threat of his political career. Labour have been piling the activists in here believing this is the moment they wipe the Liberal Democrats from inner London. There would be an amazing sense of euphoria and celebration in Labour. And they really piled in the resources this time? They have had activists from all over the country helping here. They have had celebrity visits from Eddie Izzard, Steve Coogan. They’ve been working incredibly hard. Tomorrow all the parties look like they’ll be battling the weather and of course something else. It doesn’t seem like it’s a really good idea for me to vote for anything cos they never said what they going to do. Even during a five-week campaign no one’s been saying anything that appeals to you to make you vote? They will say what I want to hear but they never do it after they get into power. And so to a Conservative-Labour tussle. Finchley and Golders Green. The seat of Margaret Thatcher and now held by the Tories. There will be a foreign affairs dimension here. A fifth of the constituency is jewish. Big questions over Israel and Palestine. But Labour winning here would be significant. Many thought at the outset that this would be beyond Labour’s reach. They certainly need a swing of more than 6% to win this seat. Then a few weeks ago there were some local polling which suggested they were ahead. Looking nationally at a Labour landslide you would expect this to go back from red to blue but given the closeness of the national campaign you would have thought 5,800 was a safe majority but this just shows how Labour have come back across London and the ground that they have made up in the last year or so. They may not be the closest seats on paper, but they could help show the extent of success or failure. ",,

They may not be the closest seats on paper, but they could help show the extent of success or failure. The polls open at 7.00am tomorrow and the politicians are still fighting for every vote. All the candidates have been out on the campaign trail in the final hours. We asked five parties what will they do for London. We got an excellent record in London in the last five years. Either under Borisjohnson as our mayor. A very good story forjobs in London, infrastructure in London. We need to keep London powering ahead, not be held back by Ed Miliband, Labour and the SNP. We’re going to cap the increases in private rent. And get rid of these rip-off letting agencies people are finding. It’s why we’re going to incentivise employers to pay a living wage, £9.15 in London. And why we’re going to help people with things like increasing the amount of free childcare for parents of three and four-year-olds. In London, we have a crisis on school places. More money into the budget. The health service, we need to bring UP The health service, we need to bring up a mental health services which are being starved under Labour. We need to do a lot more things like mental health. London has very similar problems to the rest of the country at in some ways they are more acute. The housing crisis. It is terrible. Many people are leaving London as a result. It has got to be addressed but we can’t do that while we don’t know how many people to plan for. We will tackle the housing crisis by building 100,000 new affordable council homes, a living rent commission, and getting rid of letting fees for those renting. We will bring the railways back into public ownership so the profits can be reinvested in the transport infrastructure and make London more equal. A living wage of more than £10 an hour, tax big business but give tax breaks to small business. Tim Donovan’s in Labour’s top target seat of Hendon tonight. And the Labour party will be cheered by the latest polling? Yes, Labour need this one and the latest polling from you guys in the Evening Standard suggests they would win this one and several others -- suggests they would win this one and several others -- you got. It has on 1+6 points, 13 points ahead of the Conservatives. The Conservatives have gone up one point, as have the Liberal Democrats, suggesting there is a squeeze in these last few days on Ukip and the Green party and that could have an impact on some of these key results as well. But, on this basis, the Evening Standard are saying Labour could win between 8-10 seats, and this may well reflect the fact that they appear to have had a good ground war for the fact that they appear to have had a good ground warfor the Bay good ground war for the Bay have been getting activists out. We know Boris johnson wants to be the MP for Axbridge. Some news on him tonight, I gather? Yes, an indication he is beginning to reduce his responsibilities at City Hall. Before the possibility that he is re-elected to Parliament, this is the fact that two bodies that run huge regeneration in L-dopa common, and the former Olympic Legacy development Corporation in east London, is no longer going to be chaired by him. He is standing down. Labour and chaired by him. He is standing down. Labourand Lib Labour and Lib Dems say he’s showing he is part-time, it’s lost focus on his job as Mayor and City Hall is Saint night but is not the case and you will continue to focus on it, but he is streamlining his responsibilities. Coming up later in the programme. Why hip hop is the more influential than the Beatles, according to one London academic at least. Seven people have been arrested by counter-terrorism officers investigating an alleged large-scale fraud linked to extremists travelling to Syria. Detectives are looking into allegations that elderly victims were cold called at home by someone impersonating a police officer. Our Home Affairs Correspondent Nick Beake is here with more details. What more details do you have? Cold calling is nothing new, but the police are becoming concerned that they are being used as a way of fundraising for Syria related terrorism and counterterrorism officers said they were investigating today a large-scale fraud involving extremists here, who were trying to get to Syria. It is said to focus on people who are pretending to be police officers ringing up elderly and vulnerable people and getting their bank details and also their PIN numbers. Earlier today, five men and a woman were arrested in North London. A man was arrested in Luton. Seven homes have been searched today. What about another woman arrested as part of a different investigation? Yes, this is one of those seven homes. A 1+6-year-old woman was arrested and it did not relate to this alleged scam, that is to do with one of the four Bethnal Green Academy girls who travelled to Syria. Specifically, the first girl, her whereabouts is still unknown. This 1+6-year-old woman who was arrested was detained for an offence under the child abduction act. She has now been bailed. Beyond that, we don’t have any more details. Back to this alleged cold calling scam, the police said once again today it is important we think about our information that we might be giving out during phone calls and the Metropolitan police said quite specifically that its officers never ever ask for their PIN numbers and bank details of anyone in a conversation like this. OK, thank you very much. A teenager has been has been given a two-year youth detention order for attacking a woman who then wrote an open letter about her ordeal which received national news coverage. The 17-year-old, who can’t be named for legal reasons, assaulted the 20-year-old Oxford student in north London last month as she walked home after a night out. Sarah Campbell reports. You did notjust attack me that night. I am a daughter... It was a letter which lone Wells said took 15 minutes to write but has resonated far beyond the student newspaper for which it was written. She’d waived her right to anonymity in a show of defiance and solidarity for other victims. lone was attacked just after midnight having caught the last tube. She was almost home when she was forced to the ground, her head smashed against the pavement, her bra ripped in half. In court, her 17-year-old attacker listened as Ione’s words were read out by a police officer. The district judge was told the youth who’d attacked lone had offered no explanation for his actions. The only words he could find to describe how he felt about it were ""bad, not good"". He was sentenced to two years, the maximum available. Whereas Ione’s original letter sounded defiant, today in court, her psychological trauma was laid bare. Both are an insight into the devastating and long-lasting effects of sexual assault. An army recruitment sergeant who used his power to abuse and bully women as young as 15 has been found guilty of three further counts of sexual assault. 1+6-year-old Edwin Mee was convicted of three outstanding counts at Southwark Crown Court. A jury yesterday found him guilty of a list of offences, including rape. Financial trader accused of... Extradited to face trial. It claimed he could not pay his £5 million bail because of that site had been frozen. 100 would-be voters in Hackney have been told there’s no point going to the polls for tomorrow’s General Election because they haven’t been registered. That’s despite applying before the April deadline. Tarah Welsh is in Hackney. So just explain what’s happened. We have been contacted by a number of people really concerned about this today. They say they don’t know if they can vote, even though they registered already before the deadline. The council says this affects about 100 people. They have blamed it on the government online registration system saying voters information had not been passed on to them in time. We contacted the Department for Work and Pensions about theirs and they say a small number of applicants could not be verified so local authorities needed to go back and get more identification from them. One woman told us today she registered ack in january and she was worried she had not heard anything from the council so contacted them over one months ago. Only yesterday they asked for a âÂPY ago. Only yesterday they asked for a copy of her passport which seat sent them. He does not know if she will be able to vote tomorrow or not. It has real ramifications for people and, you know, for the sanctity of UK democracy in a way. You can’t disenfranchise people in that way byjust allowing people to register who have registered and also tried to resolve the issue with them several times. What has Hackney had to say? just had a statement through from the acting returning officer here at Hackney Council and he said if people present themselves at polling stations we will be able to confirm whether they are registered. If not, we will see if there is any possibility of adding them to the register. But we already know some people have been told by the council today that they are not registered and they simply won’t be able to vote tomorrow. Thank you very much. And the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition is fielding candidates in over a third of London seats in the General Election. Its policies include raising the minimum wage from £6.50 to £10 an hour, scrapping university tuition fees and introducing rent controls. It also opposes cuts in public services. Tusc believes if you vote for the same old parties you’ll get the same old policies of cuts and privatisation whoever wins. So we say send a message to Westminster, vote Tusc against cuts and elect candidates, trade unionists and community campaigners voting to defend public services, to get a £10 an hour minimum wage, and to build the homes that Londoners need. Still to come this Wednesday evening. The after party, got in at 5.30 in the morning, and then waking up about 9.30 to make breakfast. It’s been revealed that last Thursday’s rail chaos at Clapham junction was caused by a mistake made by engineers carrying out track repairs. 900 passengers had to be led to safety along the rail line. Others were stranded on trains for hours. Our transport correspondent Tom Edwards reports. Absolutely dire. Shambolic. It was getting a bit stir crazy. There was no fresh air. There was no air conditioning. Completely disorganised. There has been no communications. Stuck on a train for five hours. Last Thursday was horrendous for thousands of commuters that use Clapham junction. Trains could not move. Firefighters had to lead passengers down the tracks and the reason we’ve now been told - engineers made a mistake in replacing the power rail. Melissa jones was stuck on a train for three-and-a-half hours. She missed an exam. She will have to pay another £100 to redo it. Are you cross about that knock-on effect, frustrated? I’m extremely frustrated now to know that that was an engineering fault, that they haven’t tried and tested the line before we got on the line. That’s extremely annoying and frustrating. I’m really quite cross about that. The conductor or third rail powers the trains. It was removed the night before by Network Rail engineers during track repairs between Clapham junction and Wandsworth Common. When they replaced it, though, it was in the wrong position and trains stalled. Network Rail has once again apologised to passengers and thanked them for their patience. No one was available for interview, though. But, in a statement it said it hoped its maintenance teams would learn the lessons to try and minimise the same thing happening again. This is the latest high-profile failure caused by Network Rail. And there are now more calls again for significant improvements to the service being provided for the capital’s rail commuters. Next, a question for you. What type of pop music has made the biggest cultural impact? Rock ‘n’ Roll? Heavy Metal? New Romantic? Acid? Well, a group of London academics think they have the answer, as Alice Bhandukravi explains. A huge hit for the rhythmic switch took them to the top of the US Billboard chart in 1983. Researchers trying to understand how Poppy is has evolved in the last 50 years say the likes of Sweet Dreams we’re not as revolutionary as what happened in 1991. Amateur musician and amateur scientist says the chord patterns of the new wave and you romantics were taken over by something else. Rap music. With the revolution in the 1990s, you get something else. Previously all music charts was based on some sort of chord structures, they were different between songs, but suddenly you didn’t need any. The focus was on speech and rhythm. The scientists analysed 17,000 songs and found that hip-hop at biggest impact on the charts. Pop music imitates a certain authentic culture and tries to take some safeness to sell. Britney Spears will take a certain influence may be a drum, court patterns. justin Timberlake did this. -- court patterns. I think ~ .|t . It was radical, what it was trying to say.

The new world snooker champion came home today. 38-year-old Stuart Bingham from Basildon became one of the oldest ever snooker world champions in a gripping final in Sheffield at the weekend. This afternoon he was back at his local club in Essex. Sarah Harris has been to meet him. CHEERING Back home in Essex is world snooker champion, Stuart Bingham. A hero in the eyes of members at the Lanes Club near Basildon where he’s been practising as long as anyone can remember. What happened over the bank holiday is still sinking in. It’s been a bit of a rollercoaster the last couple of days, but the after party, got in at 5.30 in the morning, and then waking up about 9.30 to make breakfast. Got home late last night, back to Essex, and the phone ain’t stopped ringing. ANNOUNCER: Your champion, Stuart Bingham! At 38, he is the oldest player to win the title since Ray Reardon lifted the trophy aged 1+5 back in 1978. Some fellow players claimed he didn’t have the bottle to win the big one, but this was his response. Four little words. Winner, winner, chicken dinner! And there are plenty of people back at his home club in Essex who believed in him all the way through. He’s really worked very hard for it. 20 years as a professional. Dedicated every day. Travels to every competition around the world. Never hardly misses anything. Thoroughly deserves it. And he’s given fellow players at the club plenty to shout about. An inspiration for all ages. I was so proud I started to cry. Yeah, I do feel proud actually. He’s a Basildon boy, same as me. He’s done very well for himself and he’s made Basildon proud. His main ambition now is to take his wife and kids on a caravan holiday to Clacton. His life, he says, won’t change. So we know ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"" is your catchphrase. And obviously you deserve it more than ever, so from BBC London, there we are, a roast chicken dinner especially for you. Congratulations. Brilliant, saves my wife cooking tonight. Maybe it will taste better as well! You’d better not say that otherwise you’ll be going to Clacton OI’! yOUIâ oWI’I. I know. If you feel you’ve seen enough of politicians the last few weeks, spare a thought for the dedicated men and women behind the scenes who stuff envelopes, pound the streets and sometimes take abuse from the public, all in an attempt to get their person into Downing Street. So, with the final hours ticking by, how are they feeling? Our political correspondent Karl Mercer has been out with the volunteers. Campaigning isn’t exactly a game for glory hunters for glory hunters full sweat tends to involve a lot of this. Plenty of this. And hours of this. And most people do it do it the love of politics, a volunteer army keeping the wings of democracy turning. A glamorous old world. I stuffed envelopes, did the washing up, helped inputted data, washed the lavatory floor. How is that? I enjoy seeing different parts of London. And I like to know that hopefully I’m actually helping to secure a majority for the Conservatives. If anyone needs more information, give them one of these. A manifesto. Paul is going to give you at left around the corner. Do people think you are we’re doing this? Yes, very weird. When you go down the pub on to talk about marginal constituencies, they shot up a bit. But what I try to get across is how much I care about it. Personally, it’s very important for young people to take an interest and be involved in politics. I have done it as a subject and I got very interested in that side of it, sol thought I would take it upon myself to get involved and inspire my friends to get involved because we the Next Generation and the need to make sure politics our way. I enjoy it, to be honest. Of course. Ithink friendship and politics don’t go together generally. You come here why? It’s really good. Everybody should have a dose of this. An interesting insight. It’s that time of the evening for a check on the weather. Nina Ridge is here with the forecast. We had taken a battering over the last couple of days. A few showers around but we have got lighter wind tomorrow and drier conditions. On the satellite picture you can still see some clearer spells, a few showers out there and we will keep them in the next couple of hours, but at the wind will die down. Any showers of the night are scattered. A lot of places beginning tomorrow on a dry note with temperatures, 8-9. Some patchy cloud around and we need to cater for a few showers as we go through the day tomorrow but they should be liked, fairly well scattered and into the afternoon, the general trend will be to push their way northwards. South London likely to have a dry afternoon. Some spells of sunshine coming through. The combination of increased sunshine and light wind will help the temperature. 11+-15 in the centre of London. 17-18 on Thursday afternoon. By Friday, high-pressure trying to build in from the East but we have a battle with weather fronts coming in from the Atlantic. It does mean an east and West split. Further west we are more likely to pick up some cloud and patchy and light rain, dry conditions further east and high-pressure. Temperature is not doing too badly. Lighter winds. Not feeling too bad through the afternoon. 17-18. What about the weekend forecast? , showers around. By the time we get to Sunday, mostly dry but it looks like it should turn a bit warmer. That is the news the waiting to hear. Thank you very much. The main headlines. The main UK party leaders have been making the most of the few hours they have left to win over the electorate until the polls open at 7am tomorrow morning. Around 100 voters in Hackney have been told they are unable to vote because they haven’t been registered, despite applying before the April deadline. The council says the application details hadn’t been forwarded to them by the government’s digital service. More on the day’s stories on our website.

23,BBC News 24,6-may-2015,BBC News at Ten,22:00,30 mins,True,"Tonight at Ten: The campaign is over. The polling stations across the UK will open in 9 hours’ time. For the party leaders it’s been one of the most keenly-contested election campaigns of recent times. They’ve covered hundreds of miles on the last full day of campaigning, focusing on their target seats. I say let’s build on what we have done, don’t go back to square one. You have the power to elect a government that understands it is only when working people succeed, that Britain is exceeded. --succeeds. The Liberal Democrats will be the surprise story of this general election campaign. UKIP’s Nigel Farage insisted his party would do much better than many of the pundits and polls were suggesting. And the SNP’s Nicola Sturgeon tells supporters they’re ‘within touching distance’ of making Westminster history. We’re in the BBC election studio with all the news on the eve of polling day. Also tonight: We’ll be talking to seasoned voters in Lancashire, and hearing the views of first-time voters in London. ~ I will be exploring where in the United Kingdom this election will be won and lost. And coming up and sports Dale BBC News, the former England manager Graham Taylor has denied allegations he spoke about being pressured to limit the number of black players he selected for the national team. Good evening once again from the BBC’s election studio. This is where, in 24 hours’ time, our coverage of the results will begin, after one of the hardest-fought election campaigns of recent times. The polling stations open at 7am in the morning across the United Kingdom. On this last day of campaigning party leaders have been focusing their efforts on the all-important target seats, which will shape the final outcome. David Cameron, Ed Miliband, and Nick Clegg have been covering hundreds of miles, and their fellow leaders across the UK have been no less busy, as our deputy political editorjames Landale reports. Please welcome, the Prime Minister. The final hours of the final day. For the leaders there was one more speech, one more rally, one more photo opportunity, one more visit to a marginal constituent. A long campaign ending as it began, with the polls close and the stakes high for so many voters undecided. Early on in this campaign David Cameron was criticised for lacking passion, but not tonight, not in Carlisle. How you vote could make a real difference in this election campaign. It comes down to a choice of leadership. Whether you want me to continue leading our country and taking it forward, or if you want Ed Miliband and you go back to the start and waste the work of the last five years. Yes, it is this week. The Prime Minister began his day in the early hours at a supermarket warehouse in Bristol. He wants voters to vote for the Tories because of their promise of a stronger economy, but as the campaign has gone and he warns of a risk for backing the Labour government. A message she hopes goVâI’f’li’|'Iâi’ll. A TTIESSBQE Si’Iâ i’IOpâS TTIEBFIS BS government. A message she hopes means as much to farmers in Wales to mothers. But tonight his voice breaking, he returned to a familiar theme. I say let’s build on what we’ve done, do not go back to square one. If you want a brighter future, get out there tomorrow and vote Conservative. Thank you very much! Ed Miliband began the campaign caricature by his opponents but he has defied expectations and grown in confidence. Tonight in Leeds he hammered home his key message, the risks he believes a Tory government would pose to the NHS. You have the power to rescue our NHS. You have the power to elect a government that understands it is only when working people succeed that it succeeds. Use your power, before you, your family and for our NHS. But with polls close, is it too late to change voters minds? Voters perhaps in Scotland, where Labour is facing huge losses. I think Edward make a great Prime Minister. He thinks he can be premised, even if Labour needs the support of other parties. Earlier in Lancashire he once again urged voters to back him tomorrow. I am not asking you to simply vote for Labour tomorrow. am not asking you to simply vote for Labourtomorrow. I Labour tomorrow. I am asking you to vote for yourself and your family. Above all, I am asking you to vote for a country where people but working families first again. After an almost nonstop tour from lands end Nick Clegg ended his touring Scotland, hoping that energetic campaigning and boundless confidence will help his party to fight the polls. At the beginning of this campaign we were written off, and yet tomorrow, when the polls close, the Liberal Democrats will be the surprise story of this general election campaign. He wants voters to allow him to carry on holding the centre ground of politics, giving stability to another coalition, with him holding the balance of power. You have sticky feet? I can smell your sticky feet. But can he smell defeat question mark over voters listening to him any more question at some Lib Dems are braced for losses, he hopes to save his seat in Sheffield. The Liberal Democrats would give a heart and brain to any government. Put money in your schools and hospitals. Despite a campaign that has no voice met expectations, polls suggest support for Ukip is older gap. Tonight in Kent Nigel Farage said his party was set to win more votes than ever before. Folks, the Ukip vote has not declined, the Ukip vote is rock solid and I have a feeling there are lots of people out there who are shy Ukip voters who do not tell the opinion pollsters how they feel. I really believe that. Nigel Farage is perhaps Ukip’s biggest asset. He engages with voters like few politicians. I was a banker, was I a banker? You were a stockbroker. No. His party support is spread so thinly Ukip might only win a few MPs, so their focus now is making sure that he South Thanet. If he loses he has promised to resign and spend more time in the pub. I hope on Friday morning there many members of the liberal metropolitan elite that wake up with a huge hangover because of what Ukip has achieved. As for the Green Party, early hopes of the surge have yet to be fulfilled after their party leader has struggled in interviews during the campaign. Today she appealed once again to disaffected voters. The Green Party is offering real change. A change from business as usual politics. Offering politics built on values and principles, and saying to people, vote for what you believe in. Thus ends a campaign that at times has been controlled, with few surprises, that a campaign nonetheless with a huge amount at stake. How people vote tomorrow will decide not gets to work in there, notjust what gets decide not gets to work in there, not just what gets done to fix the NHS and the economy but potentially determine the future of the United Kingdom and its mentorship to the European Union. Some photo Bourdy been cast by post, tonight in London they were being checked and sorted. Many millions have yet to make make UP Many millions have yet to make make up their minds alone put across in the box. This is what it comes down to: Will the removal vans be needed in Downing Street or not? Scotland has provided the most dramatic campaign battleground of the past six weeks. The Scottish National Party is set to make unprecedented gains, mostly at Labour’s expense if the opinion polls are to be believed, and Nicola Sturgeon said her party was within touching distance of making Westminster history. Our Scotland correspondent james Cook has more details. Is this woman about to change Scotland and Britain forever? Nicola Sturgeon has braved the weather in this election, mobbed by media and fans wherever she goes. She now hopes to reshape the political landscape for good. Tomorrow is an opportunity for us to unite and link arms as one Scotland and vote SNP to make our voice heard. And that means, for the first time, the SNP changing British economic policy. Forcing Labour to increase public spending, in return for support at Westminster. On Friday morning, if the voters across the UK decide not to give Ed Miliband or David Cameron a majority, then they are saying they want different parties to have to work together. My message remains; if there is an anti-Tory majority on Friday morning, then the parties that make up that anti-Tory majority should work together. I think this could be a watershed election, but we will have to wait and see how people vote. Last time they voted in A1 Labour MPs and just six from the SNP, but that was then. Nothing lasts forever. Scotland was once a liberal nation. In the 1950s Conservatives held sway and since then the Labour Party has dominated. So have we now breached another turning point in history? He hopes not, but feels so. The Scottish Labour leader knows the polls are bleak and that red ink might be wiped off the map of Scotland tomorrow. You cannot get a Labour government by voting for other parties. David Cameron says he wants to cling on to power even if he has one seat more than Labour. The message to Scotland is clear. Every Labour MP we sent to the House of Commons can remove David Cameron from office. And from the SNP tonight, a final message in Tsonga. Nicola Sturgeon hopes tomorrow will bring a new dawn for her party. james Cook, BBC News, Edinburgh. So tonight, on the eve of polling day, we have the very latest with our correspondents who’ve been tracking the campaigns. We start with Gavin Hewitt, who’s been following the Conservative campaign, and he’s in Oxfordshire. Before Gavin we will go to Lucy Manning who has been following Labour. Ed Miliband ended his election campaign with a rally here in Leeds. So how has he done? He has had some eye-catching policies banning non-dons, cutting stamp duty for the first time buyers and also the more he has appeared in public the more he has appeared to grow in confidence. But this has been a campaign that is largely appealing to Labour’s core vote. He has been on the defensive over Scotland and the SNP and he has struggled with those accusations that Labour spent too much. But he is optimistic he can be Britain’s next Prime Minister and bring Labour its first election when for a decade. -- and bring Labour its first election when for a decade. -- win. David Cameron arrived back here in his Oxfordshire constituency this evening, after his marathon with. Tour the country. He has been in good spirits, even bullish, although he did say to me earlier in the day he accepted this would be a tight race. Right up, the emphasis very much on the economic recovery and not putting it at risk. And at the final campaign stopped and I in Carlisle he said the election in his view boiled down this: A choice of leadership. Yes, Nick Clegg has made it after an epic 1000 mile journey, Yes, Nick Clegg has made it after an epic1000 milejourney, starting in lands and yesterday morning at 5am and ending here in the North of Scotland tonight. I think the Lib Dems are feeling pretty chipper about whether campaign has got them too. They think that they will win more seats than the polls suggesting. Their centrist message they think has gone down with voters who were looking for more stability. And theyjust wonder whether they might hold the balance of power after the big vote tomorrow. There has been no battle bus or grand UK tour on the Ukip campaign. It has been centred in key areas like hearing Kent. Today Nigel Farage was on the street and doorstep saying he is with the party of ordinary people. Tonight there was a final rally cry, and patriotically beach made here, urging supporters to take back Britain from the European Union. -- patriotic speech. The test will be whether it can do enough to exert any influence over a future government. There is a great sense of excitement and optimism among the -- There is a great sense of excitement and optimism among the -- Nicola Sturgeon and her team. They are ending the campaign as they began, that only the SNP would stand up for Scotland at Westminster. Eight months ago the SNP’s central proposition of Independence was defeated at the ballot box. Extraordinary to think of that now. The party has seen a dramatic resurgence since then, polling incredibly well, way ahead in the polls of Labour, making this the most intriguing election that anyone here in Scotland can remember. james Cook in Edinburgh and all our campaign correspondents - thank you. The latest aggregate of the various polls suggests that public opinion has barely changed since the campaign began, and while A million people have already cast their votes by post, the polls also suggest that many people have been undecided. Our special correspondent Richard Bilton has been talking to voters in the marginal constituency of Morecambe and Lunesdale, in Lancashire. It has been a long one, but the journey is nearly over. No corner of the land untouched by the effort to win over voters. The campaign has been at its most intense in a few dozen key marginals, and this is one of them, Morecambe and Lunesdale. It is a mixture of town and country. The polls suggest it is a straight fight between Conservative and Labour. And the difference at the moment it only a few hundred votes. And this is the heart of the constituency. The seaside town of Morecambe. Down in the library it is guitar practice. What do they make of what they have seen? I think it has been a long campaign. I have liked the live debates, because it is a chance for real people to ask important questions. Theyjust seem to contradict what they are saying, and I do not know whether to believe what they are saying. Even now? Even now. Around the corner this lot have seen plenty of campaigns before. There are a lot of over 55s in Morecambe, they could make the difference. So what do they think of a longer, more media centred campaign? They do tend to stick very carefully to the party line. For me it would be competent. If I could believe any of them were competent, I would vote for anybody. I don’t like Cameron, for one. I think he is very... In yourface. And Miliband is a wimp. Let’s go now, speed it up! It is all a bit intense at the spinning class, and for politicians too this is the big push. Now all of their efforts have been to sway the floating voters and there are plenty working out here. A bit confused, really. Not sure who is going to do what. I think it has been interesting, actually. I have enjoyed the debates. The debate with the public last week, that was really good. Did it help you decide? No. There were many here who had made up their mind, but plenty who hadn’t. Even after all that campaigning the critical marginals are still deciding. So on the eve of election day, our political editor Nick Robinson is with me and in Glasgow we have our Scotland political editor Brian Taylor. Brian, as we have discussed several times in this campaign, a very different context in Scotland. It is about who enters Downing Street. In Scotland it is more complex. In the aftermath of the referendum, the mindset in Scottish politics is about who speaks for Scotland and who stands up for Scotland. There is potential advantage to the SNP which rivals recognise as they try to contain them. Ed Miliband says he gets the concept of Scottish patriotism and pride. He says it should be allied without a change in UK Government. The Tories are trying to aggregate to themselves the pro union sentiment which won the day in the referendum. That was divided among various parties contesting that contest. The Tories are trying to say, vote for us as the guarantors of the union. The Liberal Democrats are saying the seats they defend in Scotland, there are straightforward fights with the SNP. The SNP appears to be ahead in the polls. It says it offers power to the people in Scotland. The people themselves will decide in the car garage and cacophony which is the exercise of democracy. -- cacophony which is the exercise of democracy. -- gargantuan clock funny. -- democracy. -- gargantuan clock funny. -- cacophony. All that frenetic activity. To imagine an election is about the campaign, the sound bites, the photo opportunities. It is about claims and counterclaims. It is not about any of that. It is about a choice, a choice of who speaks to you and what sort of country you really want to live in. People say to you and me, they are all the same these politicians, don’t they? This choice is more drastic than any I can member in and of the long time. The long time. You rant and economy. What is the proper role for government and business? -- -- What is the proper role for governmentand business? -- -- I What is the proper role for government and business? -- -- I can remember in a long time. The campaign has often looked narrow and introverted. It is easy to forget. Underlining it all, notjust the question of who speaks to Scotland and the future of the UK but the future of Britain in Europe. Never tell me none of it matters. What is a digit claim on Downing Street and government? -- a digit claim on Downing Street and government? -- a legitimate claim. We could be talking about it for hours, days and weeks. Senior politicians told me, do not worry, the fun really starts the day after. What they meant by that is the question, who has a right to govern? If the polls are wrong we will not be having this conversation. If it is close, we will. Technically it is very simple. The Government is whoever has enough votes to pass their laws and pass a budget. That may not be clear until there has been a series of negotiations carried out. It may take days and weeks. Overlying it will be the question of what is right and proper and fair. It does not have to be the biggest party that forms the Government but people might think it should be. Would it be wrong if there were no Scots in such a government? There will be many theories about what a legitimate government is on Friday as you and I have had hot dinners. As a result, if it is close, and it is still an if, if it is close, we’ll be having these conversations for many days to come. For more election information, you can go to website.

The pilot Andreas Lubitz, who’s believed to have deliberately crashed his Germanwings passenger plane in the Alps in March, had rehearsed the manoeuvre during an earlier flight on the same day, according to investigators. A preliminary report says he repeatedly programmed the plane’s autopilot to go into a steep descent while he was alone in the cockpit. Sainsbury’s has announced its first losses in a decade. Increased competition, falling food prices and a revaluation of its property portfolio pushed Sainsbury’s into the red for the year to March. Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has completed the formation of a new coalition government, less than an hour before a midnight deadline. The deal comes seven weeks after his Likud party won the election. Five parties will form the coalition and hold a one-seat majority in Israel’s parliament. Greece has made an interest payment to the International Monetary Fund of 200 million euros. A second payment of 750 million euros is due next Tuesday, but there are fears that Greece will struggle to pay it. Ministers have been negotiating with creditors and international institutions to try to unlock more than 7 billion euros in bailout funds. The singer-songwriter, Errol Brown, best known as the frontman with Hot Chocolate, has died at his home in the Bahamas at the age of 71. The band had a string of hits in the 1970s and early 80s, including Every 1’s a Winner and It Started With A Kiss. Injust a few hours, the polling stations will open and millions of voters will start casting their votes. jeremy Vine is with me to look at the key battlegrounds where this general election will be won and lost. Thank you. Let’s start with the map, as always. Scotland here, 59 seats in Scotland, only 61 last time by the SNP in yellow, below my feet. They are attacking these 1+1 Scottish Labour seats and the Lib Dems in Orange. Outside Scotland, a different story. A dogfight between Conservatives in blue and Labour in red and the Lib Dems in Orange, particularly. I have highlighted the marginals. You can see where Labour are trying to get seats back the lost under Gordon Brown. -- are trying to get seats back the lost under Gordon Brown. -- they lost. The Conservatives are aiming at their coalition partners, trying to cover the orange in places like the south-west. Let’s take the numbers and put them inside our virtual House of Commons. We will bring on the Conservatives as they were in 2010. 307 of them but they needed to get to 326. That includes speaker in its numbers. Under Gordon Brown, 258. What happened here was the Lib Demsjoined. There was a coalition and the majority of 78 which has held for five years. That’s just populate the rest of the House of Commons. We have the Nationalists and the Northern Ireland parties. These numbers will change on election night. We could have a situation where Labour and the Conservatives are in this position the day after the election. They have the most number of MPs but they do not have the 326 they need. What if a coalition is not possible? They could have an agreement called confidence and supply. It means certain people on this side, here they only needed 19 extra votes. They could get votes from this side to support key legislation like the budget and the all-important queen of speech. The other way is much more informal and much more fragile. ÂÂ Queen speech. They try to bring forward bills which a couple of dozen MPs on the opposition benches will support. They do not want to bring down the Government and should get a second election. If they do that, a minority government for the Labour and Conservatives is possible. The likely closeness of the result means that parties in Wales and Northern Ireland are also preparing their strategies for a possible hung parliament. In a moment, Chris Buckler in Belfast, but first let’sjoin Hywel Griffith in Cardiff. After what has felt like endless months of polling and punditry, the consensus in Wales is very little is expected to change. Perhaps only five, orjust three, are expected to change hands. That would be very good news for the dominant Labour Party and not so good for the smaller parties. They would argue that, in this election, just a handful of MPs still carries some political clout. GM Wood has already made plans to travel up to London on Friday. -- made plans to travel up to London on Friday. -- Leanne Wood. Iasked her what her red lines would be. We’ve been clear about our priorities. We want to end austerity and we want to win for Wales parity with Scotland in terms of powers and resources. That would deliver an additional £1.2 billion which would enable us to practically end austerity here in Wales. They would only do a deal with the Labour Party. So far they have said they are not interested. Nobody at this moment knows exactly where the balance of power will be held. For the moment at least that is still in the hands of the voters. In Northern Ireland, there are 18 seats being contested. Let’sjoin our Ireland correspondent, Chris Buckler, in Belfast. We are watching Westminster very closely. Some of the parties like the idea they could have certain influence if it does turn out to be a tight election. There are 18 seats to be one across Northern Ireland. In 2010, the DUP one half of them. It has been very clear saying it would support either Labour or the Conservatives if the deal was right. It is a sister party of Labour, so it is somewhat committed. They do not take seats in the British Parliament because they are Irish publicans. That changes the arithmetic inside the Commons. In simple terms it makes it easier for a party to form a government because with empty seats they need fewer MPs. Simple as that. The Ulster Unionist Party also vying for seats. It can feel like a different election in some ways. That might be different because the seats and the results here mightjust matter. So amid all the heated debate, what have first-time voters made of this election campaign? The BBC has been following some 200 young voters, 18 to 2lI-year-olds, to monitor their views in a project called ‘Generation 2015’. Our correspondent, Nomia Iqbal, has been speaking to some of them. There are lots of choices on the table. Parties of all colours, competing for your vote. It’s really important that everybody has their voice heard and just before the deadline I was sitting in my uni making sure that people were sitting there registering. Although more than three million people were eligible to vote for the first time, not all of them registered. Other people just don’t really seem to care because their lives will be the same after the election is over as well. So I don’t think they think it will make a difference. So tomorrow is the big day, where you get to vote, how have you found the last five weeks of campaigning? Enjoyable, on the whole, but I think it might be reaching a bit of a saturation point now because we know where everybody stands, you know. What sort of issues have stood out for all of you when it comes to deciding who you’re going to vote for? I think the one thing I will say about politicians is they think all we care about is apprenticeships and tuition fees. Yes. That is totally wrong. You’re all nodding at that. Do you agree? It’s treading this fine line between engaging with young people and treating them like they’re interested in completely different things to the rest of the electorate. Like, I’m interested in education, the economy and welfare, I’m not just interested in tuition fees. Any of you planning to sleep on a decision or are you all pretty sure how you’re going to vote? I think I might. I’ve narrowed it down to two parties, but I think it’s more difficult for me because I live in a super safe seat, so it’s whether to lend my support to a smaller party or whether to go with the majority, I think. So I will be sleeping on my decision. Sojust one more sleep to go before the polls finally open and, for these young people, it will be the first time they get to have their say. Nomia Iqbal, BBC News. So after six weeks of pledges and promises from the politicians, it’s decision time for millions of voters in every part of the United Kingdom. Here’s a reminder of some of the many voices and views that we’ve heard during the campaign. Taking a risk, having a punt, having a go, that pumps me up. Am I tough enough? Hell yes. Get out, we do not want you here. You are better looking in real life. Do you think the aliens did bring you? They are all tour, they do not do anything. It is big decisions to be made, Europe, the environment, the economy, the NHS. It is massive. APPLAUSE I asked you while that I should trust and Chancellor, if he worked in the corporate world he would have been fired. The promise on student loans has destroyed your reputation, why would we believe anything else you say? ~ I don’t know how to do one! Happy St George’s Day, everybody. I learnt that name is Liberal Democrats, not cats. Do you ever see any party leader taking flak, taking questions Chris Wright you don’t, it is all choreographed. None of them have ever had to do anything that makes them sweat. Thank you so much. Hell yes! Yes! It is going to be tight, isn’t it? Some of the voices and views of the 2015 general election campaign. In a moment, all the election news where you are. ",,
25,BBC1 London,8-may-2015,BBC News at One,13:45,20 mins,True,"Ukip, V ljkipi V vaiflil leader of Ukip, I will consider whether to put my name forward. I must take responsibility and therefore announced that I will be resigning as leader of the Liberal Democrats. Britain needs a Labour Party that can rebuild after this defeat, so I am tendering my resignation. The fight goes on. One of the most extraordinary election nights we can remember... The official result of this election is a majority win for the Conservatives. I have just been to see Her Majesty the Queen, and I will now form a majority Conservative government. We will govern as a party of one nation, one United Kingdom. The Conservatives win the General Election. They’ve defied the polls, winning an outright majority inthe House of Commons. In the last few minutes, David Cameron has arrived back at Ten Downing Street to begin his second term as Prime Minister. Together, we can make Great Britain, greater still. But it was a disastrous night for Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Nick Clegg, Miliband and Nigel Farage have all resigned their party leaderships. It was a stunning night for the SNP. It took all but three seats in Scotland, and its former leader is returning to Westminster. The Scottish lion has roared across this country. We’ll be assessing the new political landscape of the United Kingdom. The Lib Dem meltdown in London leaves them with only one MP, with their biggest names defeated. We’ll have a full round of all the results in London - with reaction and analysis. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News from Westminster, where David Cameron has just returned to Number 10 Downing Street as Prime Minister, after one of the most dramatic nights in British political history. The Conservatives have defied all the pundits and won a majority of MPs in parliament. In the wake of the results, Labour’s Ed Miliband, the Liberal Democrat’s Nick Clegg, and Nigel Farage of Ukip have all resigned as their party’s leader. So with just a handful of seats still to declare, the Conservatives have 328 MPs, 23 more than at the last election and a majority of three. Labour have 232 MPs, a loss of 26. The Scottish National Party won all but three of the seats in Scotland, and it was a terrible night for the Liberal Democrats. They now have only eight MPs. The Democratic Unionist Party won eight seats in Northern Ireland, and others took 15 - including three for Plaid Cymru, and one each for Ukip and the Green Party. The Conservatives took almost 37% of the vote, with Labour on 30.5%. Ukip took 13% but their leader failed to win a seat. The Liberal Democrats lost two-thirds of their 2010 vote, receiving just 8%. We’ll be getting all the reaction to the results from our correspondents but first here’s our Political Correspondent, Ben Wright, with the story of an extraordinary night in British politics. Decisive, clear-cut, emphatic. This was a sense saysal victory for David Cameron, who left Buckingham Palace a short time ago. -- Cameron, who left Buckingham Palace a short time ago. -- a sensational victory. He will have a second term as Prime Minister. No hung Parliament, no haggle for power. Mr Cameron has bucked the pollsters and delighted his party. Everything I have seen over the last five years andindeed have seen over the last five years and indeed during this election campaign has proved oncen that this is a country with unrivalled skills and -- is a country with unrivalled skills and -- proved once again. A country with such good humour and great compassion. I’m convinced if we draw on all of this, then we can take these islands, with our proud history and build an even prouder future. Together, we can make Great Britain greater still. The political shock waves of this Tory majority have been huge. Labour’s Ed Miliband believed the keys to number ten where within reach but it was a devastating defeat. He was stand down as the leader this afternoon and had this message for his party. You are the most loyal, supportive, amazing people. Ithank You are the most loyal, supportive, amazing people. I thank all of you today. I am truly sorry I did not succeed. I have done my best for nearly five years. Now you need to show your responsibility. Your responsibility, not simply to mourn our defeat, but to pick yourself up and continue the fight. We’ve come back before and this party will come back again. And across Westminster, a second party leader resigned. APPLAUSE But there were cheers of defiance and support for a shattered Nick Clegg. Clearly the results have been immeasurable more crushing and unkind than I could have feared. For that, of course, I must take responsibility and therefore I announce that I will be resigning as leader of the Liberal Democrats. This is a very dark hour for our party but we cannot and will not allow decent Liberal values to be ex-sting wished overnight. This is when the night’s drama began, seconds after the polls closed. We are saying the Conservatives are the largest party. Hardly anyone predicted that. The Tories look set to beat Labour into a distant second place and the Liberal Democrats appeared doomed. The party’s former leader didn’t believe it. If this exit poll is right, Andrew, I will publicly eat my hat on your programme zbl.d Labour’s troubles and the Conservatives’ programme zbl.d Labour’s troubles and the Conservatives’ triumph unfolded in counts across the country. Take Nuneaton a top Labour target. just before 2.00am, a sign of things to come. The Conservative Party held it comfortably, as it did dozens of Labour hoped to win in England. Then, long after dawn, the most jaw-dropping result of all 18,767... Ed Balls, the architect of an economic policy, roundly rejected by voters, was, himself thrown out. Any personal disappointment I have at this result, is as nothing compared to the sense of sorrow I have at the result that Labour has achieved across the United Kingdom. Labour losses in Scotland where expected but it was a wipe-out. The #12347 took every Labour-- the SNP took every Labour seat bar one. Douglas Alexander had hoped to be Labour’s Foreign Secretary today. Instead he was beaten by a 20-year-old SNP student. Nicola Sturegon’s party has destroyed Labour’s Scottish heartland in a rout where they took 56 of the 59 seats. This was a vote to make Scotland’s voice heard loudly at Westminster. Scotland voted for that and it is now thejob of Westminster. Scotland voted for that and it is now the job of the SNP to represent those who voted for us and to represent those who didn’t to make Scotland’s voice heard. Liberal Democrat MPs were also despatched with brutal efficiency with the SNP. DAX gone, Charles Kennedy, gone. It was the same -- DAX gone, Charles Kennedy, gone. It was the same -- Danny Alexander gone. It was the same in England and Wales. Nick Clegg clung on to his seat but dozens of others did not. It is the SNP that now replaces the Liberal Democrats as the third largest party here at Westminster. And this election proves how wide the political chasm now is between Scotland and the rest of the union, with potentially huge consequences for how Parliament and the United Kingdom are run. Across Britain, Ukip won many more votes than the SNP, but tookjust a single seat. The party’s leader, Nigel Farage failed to win in South Thanet and said the electoral system was broken. This morning he quit but might come back. There will be a leadership election for the next leader of Ukip in September and I will consider, overthe leader of Ukip in September and I will consider, over the course of the summer, whether to put my name forward to do thatjob again. This election revealed the UK’s fractured politics and back in Downing Street, David Cameron said he would lead as a one nation Prime Minister, recognising there are big divisions to bridge. But now the Conservatives will govern alone. Ahead five more years of David Cameron at number ten. The SNP achieved an historic landslide General Election victory in Scotland, winning 56 out of 59 seats. Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives have all been left with just one MP each. Our Scotland correspondent, Laura Bicker, is in Glasgow. Well, Scotland hasn’tjust changed the way it’s voted, it appears to have shifted its views. Scots may have voted no inthe independence referendum but the two-year process allowed them to ask themselves the question - allowed them to ask themselves the question - what could or what should Westminster do for me? The party they have chosen to represent them is one that promised change. I must warn you that my report contains some flash photography. 26,000... CHEERING Alex Salmond, Scottish National Party, SNP, 27,000... Landslide, wipe-out, avalanche but the former SNP leader, Alex Salmond had this to say. It is an extraordinary statement of intent from the people of Scotland. The Scottish lion has roared this morning, across the country. His successor, Nicola Sturegon, at the Glasgow count was cautiously hopeful. Her party have never won a seat in this city inthe General Election. They now have all seven. Glasgow North East was won with the largest swing ever recorded inthe UK. Even those who fought for this found it overwhelming. Stunning, stunning. What do we do now? For goodness sa ke. I wonder if anybody had a plan for this? The tide was too much for the Labour Party. Stoney-faced, grimly resigned they were swept aside. Even their Scottish leader could not hold on. Scotland has woken to a Clyde which no longer runs red. Labour had been humiliated in a city and a country it has dominated for decades but there are to be no more resignations for now. This morning as the sun rose we were hurting, but inthe morning, just like this, before too long, we will bounce back and we will again be the change that working people in Scotland and across the UK need. Scotland has spoken decisively. The question is - will its voice now be heard in a UK Parliament as promised? Well, within the last half an hour, David Cameron has promised to devolve more powers to the Scottish Parliament, including taxation powers. Now the SNP still say that will not be enough. But how they’ll fight Morientes on the opposition benches -- fight Morientes on the opposition benches -- how they’ll fight for more on the opposition against we will have to wait and see. So, Ed Miliband has resigned as Labour Leader, after his dream of entering Number Ten was shattered on a devastating night for Labour, with the party performing worse than in 2010. The Shadow Chancellor, Ed Balls, headed a list of high-profile casualties. Mr Miliband said he took ""absolute and total responsibility"" for the party’s defeat. Our political correspondent, Eleanor Garnier, reports. It was a dismal night. Bitter disappointment and among the tears, cries of a catastrophic election for Labour. A whole generation of its key politicians fell, wiped out in Scotland, rebuffed across England. . Tragic result for Labour. The most depressing since ‘92 and most unexpected since ‘92. We lost our working class core vote during the New Labour years because we didn’t give good jobs to working class people and didn’t build homes for their kids. And we can’t claw it back by going back down that Blair road again. But as some Labour grandees blame Blair and New Labour for Ed Miliband’s failure, many believe his campaign did go better than expected. His personal performances applauded. So, why did it go so wrong? Fist of all, fear of the SNP and a left-wing SNP in much of England. Lack of trust in Labour on the economy and, still, Ed Miliband. His ratings improved but they are still much below David Cameron’s in terms of competence. It’s little short of a calamity for Labour and with Ed Miliband gone, the question clearly turns to what’s next. But some say simply changing the leader won’t fix it. What’s neededis the leader won’t fix it. What’s needed is wholesale change. If the ship is going inthe wrong direction, then no matter what the abilities of a new captain would be, man or woman, we’ll get the same result again. But who are some of the new faces ready to step forward? From Labour’s front bench, the more well-known From Labour’s front bench, the more well- known like Yvette Cooper. Or Chucka Umunna, the Shadow Business Secretary. Could it be a relative unknown like the Barnsley Central MP, Danjarvis. Afterthe unknown like the Barnsley Central MP, Danjarvis. After the shock of such a shattering defeat, the soul-searching begins. Notjust for Ed Miliband, but for the party he’d hoped to take into Government. So, let’s see how the new House of Commons will look. jeremy Vine is inthe BBC’s virtual chamber. We have just one result to go so we are giving awe stable set of numbers here. Let me show you the Government benches. We bring on the governing party. The Conservatives. 331. Remember, you need to cross the line, 326 seats to govern with an overall majority. They have done that. They have a majority of 12 seats and you can see David Cameron, the Prime Minister there, seats and you can see David Cameron, the Prime Ministerthere, secure in the knowledge that he can govern alone. At the last election in 2010 it was different. They were here. They didn’t have an overall majority. They had to have the help of the Liberal Democrats, not so this time. The opposition, all of them, on the other benches, starting here with Labour. 232 seats for Labour. Down 26, all of their seats in a terrible result for Labour and Ed Miliband won’t be spending any more time on the frontbenches. Leadership now for somebody else. There are so many stories tonight. The Conservative victory. This extraordinary Labour defeat which takes them back even before 2010. Even further back than Gordon Brown was. Also the SNP. Have a look at this. So the SNP came into this election withjust 6 this. So the SNP came into this election with just 6 MPs. They added 50. Quite remarkable. And it will the complexion of Westminster. But the Liberal Democrats, in reverse have gone down nearly 50. Down 59 to eight MPs. So they have their own particular crisis to be handle after a nightmare 24 hours. As for the other MPs, let’s have a quick look at them as well. Plaid Cymru on three, staying roughly where they were. The Greens on one. Ukip having a new MP at a general election for the first time and the others, Northern Ireland parties on 18. So, a sensational election result, and this is how it looks, with the Conservatives in charge but that majority looking very, slender. Let’s get reaction from the three main Westminster party headquarters. In a moment, we’ll hear from Lucy Manning who’s with Labour, and Vicky Young who’s at the Liberal Democrats. But first, let’s go to Gavin Hewitt who’s with the Conservatives. Can they really believe it? Well, I think it is fair to say that nobody in the Tory think it is fair to say that nobody inthe Tory campaign expected a result like this. The most optimistic were talking about perhaps getting 295 seats or even 300. Their election guru spoke of the importance of the last 72 hours. David Cameron was relentless on message - don’t gamble with the economic recovery, don’t allow in Labour, propped up by the SNP. So, David Cameron now has immense authority, but a tiny majority. It is sure to be tested, not least with the EU referendum. Now, here is Lucy Manning. The staff members could not hold tears back as Ed Miliband announced his resignation an hour ago. This was the man who yesterday thought he was in with a chance of being Prime Minister. Overnight he lost most of the party seats in Scotland. He lost two key Shadow Cabinet members. He lost the fight against Tories inthe key marginals and any chance he had to govern. Why did it happen? Well, Scotland, of course. Two nights ago I said I thought they had concentrated on a message to the core Labour vote. A Labour person said to me, that is not right, that means we will lose. He came up to me now and said, ""You were right."" For Ed Miliband a crushing defeat. He is gone. It will be up to the new lead tore try and rebuild the party. Vicki Young is with the Liberal Democrats. They are a party who have been stunned by the sheer nature of this defeat. They knew they were going to lose seats, but they had not predicted the turmoil and extent of it. They talked five years ago, Nick Clegg, about a new politics, as he decided that controversial decision to take the party into Government for the first time with the Conservatives. Well, it seems the coalition has totally crushed them. They as the junior partner seem to have taken the blame for things which went wrong and taken none of the credit for things which went well. Many said Nick Clegg’s leadership will be judged by history to be better and to be far kinder than the voters have been today. That is no consolation for this party which needs a leadership contest, pick itself up and try to rebuild. Thank you. Our assistant political editor, Norman Smith, is in Downing Street. You have followed all the events overnight and, Norman, extraordinary. No other word for it. We really, really didn’t expect this outcome. jane, I have covered more elections than I should have, but I have to say, last night was an epic and extraordinary election, where in the space of 24 hours the whole political landscape has been re-cast. A cast list of household names thrown overboard. Scotland has become a virtual one-party state. Inevitably that will raise questions as to whether we are now on course for another independence referendum, potentially with the break-up of the union. The leader ofs of the three parties, Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg, Nigel Farage, all resigned within an hour of each other. Labour, a worse defeat than that endured under Gordon Brown. The Liberal Democrats reduced to the lowest number of MPs since the party was formed and for Ukip, whether they are doomed to decline. As for David Cameron, a stunning success. He dragged his party back from the brink of defeat and a possible hung parliament, to achieve what only Mrs Thatcher achieved before, to increase the majority of an incumbent Government. But he too now faces a profound challenge. How does he bind this country together? His answer- one nation Conservatism. And the offer of more devolution for Scotland. The hope perhaps of a return to compassionate Conservatism. The hope that may bind together a nation after a divisive and inthe end a bloody election. Norman, thank you.

We will see high pressure build from the near continent. Low pressure pushing in from the Atlantic. Tightening isobars ahead of that. Cloudy with outbreaks of rain. For England and Wales though, not a bad day for Sunday. Sunny spells, largely dry and 19-20 Celsius, the top temperature. There is a sign things may warm up more as we head towards the early part of next week. For now, back to jane, in Westminster. Now, a reminder of our top story this lunchtime: The Conservatives win the general election. They’ve defied the polls, winning an outright majority in the House of Commons. That’s all from us. Now on BBC One, it’s time for the news where you are. Have a good afternoon. Good afternoon. It’s been a devastating General Election for the Liberal Democrats with now only one MP in London. They lost six seats and four Government ministers in the process. For Labour, there are significant gains but not as many as they’d have hoped. The Tories made some gains but overall they are a seat down since the last election. With a round-up, here’s our Political Correspondent, Karl Mercer. It could hardly have been a worse night for the Lib Dems in London. One after another their big names fell. Vince Cable, Simon Hughes, Ed Davey, Lynne featherston, Paul Burstow, all gone. How do yourself and the Lib Dems pick yourself up? Across the board it is going to be a bad night? You have worked that out, yes, we have worked that one out. Well, let’s reflect. I mean, we are a little shocked because our figures were suggesting we were going to do a lot better. It does seem to me thatit a lot better. It does seem to me that it was very much a late swing by the polls hadn’t picked up. APPLAUSE Simon Hughes lost to Labour’s newcomer, Neil Foyle, beaten after 32 years as Southwark’s MP To the people of Bermondsey and Southwark, I have to say thank you from the bottom of my heart. You could not, ever, ever have given a greater opportunity and I hope you think for 32 years, I have served you well. Thank you very much. APPLAUSE Tom Brake is now the Lib Dems last man standing in the capital. He believes the party lost supporters after going into coalition with the Tories. Those people will not support a party which has been in Government, which they now see as being an establishment party. We have to go back to our grassroots, rely on our local activists and build-up from the bottom upwards and ensure we start to regain some of the seats that we have lost. His party had lost to the Tories in the suburb an south-west, to Labour in its three inner-city seats. They won here in Ealing Central and here in Enfield North, where former MP, joe Ryan was re-elected. It is good to be back. Ilford North and Brentford also turned red. We have just won Ilford North. So I’m feeling cheery about it. Actually, we are not doing well in the country. We are doing better in London and I think that’s in part because of the way in which the Labour Party campaigns in London. So you have won a bellwether London Essex border seat on a big swing like this, on a night like this, I’m over the moon. All the work we have put in in recent weeks will be repaid by hard work in the next five years. Overall Labour picked up seven seats. They had hoped for more. jane Ellis son is duly-elected. The Tories held off chalence in places like Battersea, Harrow, Finchley, Hendon and in Croydon Central, where Gavin Barwell won the seat by 165 votes. I think you have to work hard as the MP to reach out to the people that didn’t vote for you and notjust celebrate that you have won. My experience is there are lots of people here in this down who are naturally Conservative but don’t vote for the Conservative Party. David Cameron has done a lot to bring some of those people into our column but there is more to do over the next five years. Borisjohnson, the Conservative Party candidate, 22,511. Of course there was another Conservative elected back to the House of Commons. London’s mayor winning a second job in Uxbridge and talking up his party’s performance on the night. Obviously it is a very, very clear victory for the Conservatives and a very bad night for Labour. So a night when the blue and red corners of London will both claim victories of sorts but the night when the yellow team became a solo act. So those are some of the losses and gains. But when you put the information on a map of London - what does it look like? Here’s Alex Bushill. First of all, let’s bring in the political map going into this general election. These are the results of the 2010 general election, you can see I’m standing in the Labour heartlands, with a strong south-west presence for the Lib Dems here in the city. What does that mean in terms of the number of seats per political party? Well, if we bring in the numbers, you can see the Labour Party had ten more seats than the Conservatives coming into this election, with the Lib Dems on seven. That was then, this is now. You can see, Labour have stretched their lead. They hold 1+5 out of a total of 73 seats here in the city. The Conservatives more or less the same, down one. But it is the Lib Dems who have had a catastrophic failure with just a single MP now here in the city. Let’s bring in the change of seats. Those that have been taken from other parties. You can see where Labour have done particularly well, with seats like Ilford North here, where they have seen a 6% swing from Conservatives to Labour. If we move further west we can see other notable gains, including Ealing Central where there was a majority overturned of 3,700. Again from the Conservatives to Labour. If we move down into the south-west, we can see very notable victories. This time the political scalp of Vince Cable, the Business Secretary, his seat of Twickenham, he has lost that to the Conservatives with a whopping 11% swing. Let’s bring in all the seats to get an overall sense of the picture. You can see the Conservatives have done well, particularly in the south-west but also the outer boroughs but it is good news particularly for Labour. It may have been a disappointing night nationally but it has been very good news in London. As a result of Labour gains we can say that from Hayes in the west, all the way through to Dagenham in the east, we can walk the length of London in Labour- held territory. So we’ve heard about the situation inside London. But what about the surrounding counties? If we take a look at what it was like five years ago - we see the Tories dominating in-all but three seats. Now let’s see how that’s changed overnight. The answer- not at all. The map still pretty much all blue, except those three Labour seats of Luton South, Luton North and Slough. Politics dominating the news but there will be a three-minute silence today at 3.00pm marking VE today. Of there is a weather forecast it. Here is the weather forecast for this afternoon for the commemoration at VE day in central London. Mostly dry with brightness around. Where we get the brightness, it’ll feel pleasant and warm. 18 or 19. We have a fairly light breeze, too. We might see a few dribs and drabs of rain and light showers as we head into this evening and overnight period but mostly dry, really cloudy and a very mild night to come, too, with temperatures not dropping out of double figures. So, a nice mild start to the day tomorrow. Tomorrow there will be a lot of dry weather around. There will even be some spells of brightness and sunny spells developing. You will want to watch out for one or two light showers that may pop up here and there throughout the afternoon, perhaps turning heavier at times. It’ll also be breezy which will help the blow the showers along nicely with top temperatures of 17 or 18. Changing again on Sunday. High pressure digging in from the south-east corner. It looks like it will be dry and feeling warm. Eventually a southerly breeze which will push up warmer air from the near continent. Overthe will push up warmer air from the near continent. Over the course of the weekend, blustery showers on Saturday. By Sunday, dry, sunny and warm and that warmth will only improve into next week. That’s it for now. Riz will be in Westminster at 6.30pm to bring you more analysis and updates of how Parliament now looks and what it means for Londoners. All later on BBC One. For now, have a very good afternoon. MUSIC: In The Hall Of The Mountain King We wish to know - why is there no more magic done in England? I myself am quite a practical magician. Mr Norrell! I met a man under a hedge who told me I was a magician. I am Strange. Indeed. You have no idea where these paths lead! I can make you... king. Arabella! GUNFIRE You have opened a door to hell and invited the devil into England! I swear to destroy him... ..before he destroys us. Welcome to everyone just joining Welcome to everyone justjoining us, you are welcome to join the election coverage today, lots to talk about this afternoon because although we now know the result which is a good place to be, only one seat in St Ives to come, there is lots to talk about in terms of what this government could mean for David Cameron and for Labour in terms of its experience. I will ask Andrew Marr about the Scottish context in a second. Finish on that thought you were making earlier, about the leadership contest, the kind of people that should be involved and actually the kind of lever that you think can do for Labour what it needs, which is to rethink, revisit some values may be, and to regroup. There is a real challenge here because one of the problems in 2010 was we had quite a lengthy leadership contest and whilst we were having it frankly the agenda was being set by the Tories. So the challenges we need to find a leader who can, yes, develop policies but who can connect with people, who people in my former constituency think yes, they get to me, they are going to make my life better in the future than it has been. But at the same time, I think as a party we must not let the government off the hook. They’ve won the right to oven but I’m quite keen to make sure they deliver economic prosperity for everyone. I want to see if they come UP everyone. I want to see if they come up with the goods in terms of the NHS. We’ve got to oppose, whilst also trying to find the route to our future and win our way back to government. Lots of people have lost their seats overnight. Look at these images. We are going to see Tessa Munt here. One of many losses here last night. For lots of people watching and who voted yesterday, you vote and think about the cause, but actually there is a human impact. Lots of people notjust representing constituencies, some of them for many years, Simon Hughes since the for shorter periods but just tell us a little bit from your experience what that is and what you go through when that happens. It’s tough and frankly I’ve had quite a long night and it hasn’t been great but it wasn’t as bad as five years ago when I was standing on a stage and losing my seat. I think actually whatever party they are from, people who are willing to put themselves forward for election, and I said five years ago it’s important people stand when they feel they are going to lose even when they hope they will win and if people aren’t willing to do that we won’t have a ",,

So sit back, enjoy and cheer on your favourite TV talent. Sit down, everybody, as you were. We don’t know anything right now because our blood type is currently Prosecco. And the BAFTA goes to... CHEERING Oh, God, I really wish I’d prepared a speech. Good luck, everyone. I wish everyone could win. Come on, let’s go to the BAFTAs! join Graham Norton for... A shock outright win for the Conservatives, the resignations of three party leaders, an SNP landslide. It’s been quite an election. David Cameron walked into Number Ten with a majority, knowing he’s Prime Minister of a politically transformed United Kingdom. We will govern as a party of one nation, one United Kingdom. It’s been a night and a day of extraordinary drama, with the voters delivering a blow to some of the biggest names in politics. Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg and Ukip’s Nigel Farage all resigned as party leaders within an hour of each other. I take absolute and total responsibility for the result and our defeat at this election. I’m so sorry for colleagues who’ve lost their seats. The SNP sweep Labour out of Scotland. They win all but three of 59 seats. The Scottish lion has roared across the country this morning. We’ve travelled from Scotland to London getting voters’ reactions to the changed political landscape. It’s the first time I’ve smiled after a general election. Ijust can’t understand where all the pundits have been. They were saying Labour are going to do well, and these are going to do well, and Ijust don’t know where it’s all come from. Tonight on BBC London: Going, going, gone - the Liberal Democrats are all but wiped out in the capital. But Labour bucks its disastrous national trend and gains seven seats in London. Good evening and welcome to the BBC’s News at Six here in Downing Street. One of the most unpredictable elections in generations has come up with the most unexpected of results. David Cameron walked back into Number Ten this afternoon at the head of a Tory Party that had been swept back to power with a majority. Success too for the SNP. They now dominate the political map of Scotland. Equally dramatic, three other party leaders fell like dominoes, resigning within an hour of each other: Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg and Nigel Farage, who failed to win his seat. So here are the final results: The Conservatives have 331 seats and a 37% share of the vote. Labour have 232. And the SNP, 56 of the 59 available seats in Scotland. The Liberal Democrats, in coalition government last time, were decimated. They lost A9 seats, leaving them with just eight. Turnout was 66%. Our Deputy Political Editor, james Landale, has our first report tonight on an extraordinary Conservative victory. They are BFE SCEFIES WE -i-i’IEy BFE SCEFIES WE WEIâE They are scenes we were told not to expect for weeks, a shortjourney that would be taken only after days of negotiations. Instead, David Cameron and his wife travelled to Buckingham Palace today to tell the Queen that he would be staying on as her prime minister. But unlike five years ago, he returned to Downing Street not as the leader of a coalition, but the master of his own house. I have been to see Her Majesty The Queen and I will now form a majority Conservative government. After an election that strained the ties binding Scotland and England, he promised to govern as a party of one nation, one United Kingdom. I have always believed in governing with respect. That is why in the last parliament we devolved power to Scotland and Wales, and gave the people of Scotland a referendum on whether to stay inside the UK. In this Parliament, I will stay true to my word and implement, as fast as I can, the devolution that all parties agreed for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. His defeated opponent also went on a journey, also with his wife, but they went to Labour headquarters to thank his party for the hard work that in the end had not paid off. The responsibility, Ed Miliband said, was his alone. It is time for someone else to take forward the leadership of this party sol someone else to take forward the leadership of this party so I am tendering my Riz at nation. It was not the speech they had wanted to hear, northe not the speech they had wanted to hear, nor the speech he had wanted to give. I am truly sorry I did not succeed. I have done my best for nearly five years. Now you need to show your responsibility. Your responsibility not simply to mourn our defeat, but to pick yourself up and continue the fight. We have come back beforehand this party will come back again. But will his party come back again, too? Nick Clegg’s Lib Dems suffered devastating losses, with just Dems suffered devastating losses, withjust eight MPs remaining in Parliament. Forthat, of course, I must take responsibility and therefore I am ounce I will be resigning as leader of the Liberal Democrats. History, he said, would judge the Lib Dems more kindly than the voters who had inflicted a crushing blow on the party. But that was little comfort for his supporters. Fearand was little comfort for his supporters. Fear and grievance has one, liberalism has lost, but it is more precious than ever. And we must keep fighting for it. This is a very dark hourfor our party, keep fighting for it. This is a very dark hour for our party, but we cannot and will not allow decent Liberal values to be extinguished overnight. Our party will come back. Our party will win again. The party that won last year’s European elections today won millions of votes and came second in many seats in the north-east of England. But a night, Ukip hasjust one MP, and it is not him. Nigel Farage had promised to resign if he did not win Thanet South. I’m a man of my word, so I shall be writing to the UK Ukip national executive in a few minutes saying that I am standing down as leader of Ukip. But inevitably, he did not rule out standing again one day. The night had begun with a shock. We are saying the Conservatives are the largest party. Few could believe it. If this exit poll is right I will publicly eat my hat on your programme. As the night wore on, it became clear the exit poll was right, with the Conservatives taking seats from the Lib Dems and holding off Labour, the first party of government increased its seats and votes for years. No wonder the Chancellor was smiling. The Tories succeeded in part because Labour did not, failing to make gains in key marginal seats in England and elsewhere even losing seats, including that held by the Shadow Chancellor. Any personal disappointment I have at this result is as nothing compared to the sense of sorrow I have at the result that Labour has achieved across the United Kingdom. But Labour’s worst losses were in Scotland where the party was all but wiped out, with just one MP now representing what was once the Labour heartland. Out went the party leader in Scotland, jim Murphy, and Shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander. And it was her party that caused the damage. The Scottish National Party almost swept the board, winning 56 MPs in an unstoppable landslide. The Scottish Lion has roared this morning across the country. The Nationalists took seats not just from Labour but also the Lib Dems, who suffered huge losses south of the border, punished forjoining the coalition and not living up to its promises, a party that lost much of its big names. Vince Cable, Danny Alexander, Simon Hughes and Charles Kennedy all ousted from Parliament. It was a day that defied the polls and surprised the media, a day that transformed the political map of Britain. After all the talk of hung parliament ‘s, coalitions and deals, tonight, once again, we have a government run by one party. For the first time, David Cameron is in Downing Street with a mandate to do what he wants. The only question is how much he is constrained by the small size of his majority. For now, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg had a last duty, to rate eight-- lay a wreath at the Senate after mark VE Day. They had hoped to be in government but it was not to be. They lost, and David Cameron won what he called the sweetest victory of all. As David Cameron settles in to another few years in the building behind me, how did the Conservatives manage to secure their unexpected majority? And what lies ahead now for a Conservative government? Carole Walker reports on the Conservative strategy. How are you feeling? He defied the polls and all the expectations. At his party headquarters early this morning, David Cameron thanked staff for helping deliver the Conservative majority government even he never quite believed he could achieve. The real reason to be proud and excited is that we are going to get the opportunity to serve our country again. So, how did he do it? This is bath, a seat held by the Liberal Democrats for 23 years, one of a swathe of constituencies across the South West seized by the Conservatives from their former coalition partners. Probably because of the coalition, what they did with the Conservative Party, that let a lot of Lib Dem voters down. It is for the promises they did not keep when they came into the coalition, tuition fees, etc. The Tory campaign focused on convincing voters the election was a choice between David Cameron and Ed Miliband as prime minister, and warnings that Labour, reliant on the SNP, would jeopardise the economic country. David Cameron rolled up his sleeves and injected some raw passion into a campaign in danger of appearing lacklustre and defensive. Taking a risk, having a punt, that pumps me up and it is what is changing our country. He was helped by the slump in support for the Lib Dems. The things that caught us out is how the Tories have taken every Lib Dems seat where they came second, and also practically no gains by Labour over the Conservatives. The strategy was shaped by Lynton Crosby, veteran Australian campaign director, and a former aide to Barack Obama, to focus on the economy and the offer of more jobs and lower taxes. But it will not be easy to deliver on those promises. He will need to win votes in the Commons with the narrowest of majorities over his rivals, and he will be reliant on the loyalty of his own MPs. He has already met this man, who represents the views of many Tory MPs. It is right for members of Parliament to push their agenda is, to try to drive forward things that we believe in. But ultimately, we have two work together if we are going to achieve anything. The Prime Minister faces huge constitutional challenges over Scotland and Europe. The Queen’s Speech setting out his programme for government will tell us much about how he will govern the country. So a result that no-one predicted, and one that the polls completely misjudged. An inquiry has now been launched into how they got it so wrong. I’m joined by Nick Robinson. This is not the story we expected to be discussing this evening. Absolutely right. No polestar, no pundit, no political reader saw this coming, not even David Cameron himself, who is now back in Number Ten. Why? Governing parties do not win more seats, do they? Parties that have made substantial spending cuts and are promising more do not win more seats, do they? Until today. Achieving what looked like Mission impossible, a Tory majority. How did they do it? In part, because they crushed their coalition partners. If the Lib Dem parliamentary party walked down this street now, they could hail two London cabs and there would still be two seats to spare. How else did they do it? Nigel Farage gained millions of votes but did not even get a seat for himself. And the SNP tidal wave that swept away the Labour Party in Scotland. But, and this is crucial and should not be forgotten, Ed Miliband’s Labour Party did worse than Gordon Brown five years ago, even after the worst financial crash in living memory. That means that Ed Balls, who thought he would be moving in there, Douglas Alexander, who thought he would be in the building opposite us, the Foreign Office, they are now on the unemployment register. So this is undoubtedly David Cameron’s personal triumph, this is undoubtedly David Cameron’s personaltriumph, but personal triumph, but it is also Nicola Sturgeon’s. The only remaining question, can they ever live together? Can Scotland live with the rest of the UK, all will David Cameron become the last ever Prime Minister of the UK and Nicola Sturgeon the first ever leader of an independent Scotland? Thank you. It was a remarkable night in Scotland, where the SNP swept Labour aside, taking 56 out of 59 seats. The SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, described the result as an ""overwhelming vote for change"". Gavin Esler is in Glasgow for us now. Gavin, this marks a dramatic new chapter for politics in Scotland. Welcome to Glasgow, and behind me what used to be called ""red Clydeside"" - a rock solid Labour stronghold. Now, like the whole of the city, SNP yellow. The sheer scale of the SNP’s rise and its rivals’ collapse across Scotland is still sinking in here, though tonight some are questioning how much the party’s MPs will be able to deliver against a Tory majority at Westminster. Our Scotland Correspondent, james Cook, sent this report on the SNP’s extraordinary landslide. Waiting to make history. It’s 2. 20am and the Scottish National Party hasjust pulled off a stunning coup. The Nationalists have unseated the Shadow Foreign Secretary, Douglas Alexander. They can’t believe it. But in seat after seat across Scotland, it’s the same story. It’s historic. The politicalfirmament, historic. The political firmament, the historic. The politicalfirmament, the tectonic plates in Scottish politics have shifted tonight. We’re seeing an historic water shed. For the new MP for paisley, it’s a night of emotion and pride. At 20 years old, black Black Country black, is the young -- old, black Black Country black, is the young-- Marie old, black Black Country black, is the young -- Marie Black the young-- Marie Black is the youngest member of Parliament. They’re looking for hive quality arguments and genuine change. So Clydeside is not red any more. No Glasgow, like much of Scotland has been painted yellow. True, but Britain as a whole has turned blue. And Nicola Sturgeon’s 56’s MPs will be sitting on the Opposition benches. We put ending austerity at the top of the manifesto. That’s our number one priority. Government’s -- the Government’s got to listen. There’s been an overwhelming vote against continued austerity. For Labour this is simply a calamity, one MP in Scotland. The party lost seats with majority’s of more than 20,000 breaking British political records, even the leader couldn’t cling on. REPORTER: Are you resigning and given that you’ve just presided over the most catastrophic performance your party has put in in Scotland, if you’re not, why are you not? I said last night, in what is my former constituency, that the fightback begins and we should be part of that fightback. For half a century and more, the Labour movement has towered above Scottish politics, now it’s in ruins. What on earth canjim Murphy do to rebuild it? The SNP boss insists this election was not about independence, but plenty of her supporters want it back on the agenda and politically Scotland does now look like a very different country. Our Scotland Political Editor, Brian Taylor, is with me here. What do you think the SNP can actually achieve with their 56 MPs? These are remarkable elections. This Westminster election has left Scotland and England as two nations divided by a common Parliament, as things stand you can envisage the Conservative backbenchers growling at the SNP, how dare you come down here and purport to intervene in matters solely confined to England. You have the SNP, who will respond, how dare you, as the Conservative Government purport to govern Scotland where you have but a single MP. The SNP can demand change for Scotland, of course, cannot deliver it themselves. The Conservatives have an overall majority in the House. Nonetheless, one hears from the tone, it will be common sense, I think it will be unlikely he will be overassertive on this question, because if he is, it risks the union that the party stands, the Conservative and Unionist Party, you’ll remember a quote delivered in an earlier episode in which it was said better an imperfect union than a perfect divorce, the one who said that was David Cameron, soon after taking over as leader of the Conservative Party. Thanks, as always. Well, tonight voters are coming to terms with the new political landscape. Here in Scotland there will be far reaching consequences and across the UK, millions of people are asking what it all means for them. In a moment, more from Downing Street, but first, our correspondentjon Kay has been gauging the mood among voters travelling from Edinburgh all the way back to London. Edinburgh, sixam, taking in -- 6am, taking in the news on the way to work Ecstatic about the results in Scotland. This is the first time I’ve smiled after a general election. Tories, Labouraway, election. Tories, Labour away, independence election. Tories, Labouraway, independence next. You have the Tories in Government by the looks of it, in London. Not so good. But for many commuters, the story was Labour losses more than SNP gains. Watching one after the other, high-profile names go, I wasjust one after the other, high-profile names go, I was just shocked. names go, I wasjust shocked. Ido not wish the SNP well. We will come back. Thank you. We also have a train to catch, heading towards Westminster. Passengers like Stuart and Melanie are stunned. That fellow who did the exit poll will make a fortune. We cross into the North East of England. It looked like it was going to be so tight. I can’t understand where the pundits have been saying Labour were going to do well. York, as we stop at the National Railway museum, the Tories’ victory is becoming clear. I’m reasonably happy. I think maybe it’s bad for the country that they’ve got a majority. Ithink bad for the country that they’ve got a majority. I think a coalition would have maybe been betterfor the country. The Farage moment. Surprised. Barbara and Derek reckoned that could be it for Ukip. Without him, I don’t think they’ll go very far. There’s no-one with a voice like him. Lunch time, we’ve reached Derby, where one of the city’s seats has gone from Labour to Conservative. Voters tell us the economy was the deciding factor. My son, he’s a builder, in the last five years, he’s never been out of work. Anything, Ed Miliband -- five years, he’s never been out of work. Anything, Ed Miliband -- Nick Clegg, Ed Miliband, Nigel Farage have all resigned. Have they? Not surprising. Why not? Didn’t do a good job, surprising. Why not? Didn’t do a goodjob, did good job, did they? They have to regroup and start again. London tonight, soon 56 Scottish Nationalists and hundreds more MPs will travel this route. Our trip is over, a new politicaljourney begins. The view from the voters across the UK there, after today’s extraordinary result. Our top story this evening: David Cameron walks back into Number Ten with a Conservative majority on a day of high political drama. And still to come: Making plans for Nigel - the Ukip leader resigns but says he may be Later on BBC London: What now for Boris johnson? We follow the Mayor’s progress as he returns to the House of Commons as an MP. And our floating voters give their verdict on today’s shock Conservative win. Our election boat sets sail one final time. SNP faces and the old Labour faces given their marching orders by the voters. ? Today’s shock result has claimed the leaders of no less than three parties - Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg and Nigel Farage. In a moment, we’ll be hearing from our correspondent, Vicki Young, on an utterly dismal night for the Liberal Democrats, and Alex Forsyth, who’s been with Ukip, but first our correspondent Lu,cy Manning, reports on the resignation of Labour’s Ed Miliband. There was much to cry about, massive losses in Scotland, the lost battle in Tory marginals, the loss of three Shadow Cabinet members and the lost opportunity to try and form a Government. Stillthey opportunity to try and form a Government. Still they cheered him in, looking exhausted, but this was far from the victory rally. I take total responsibility for the result our defeat at this election. I’m so sorry for all of those colleagues who lost their seats. So the Ed Miliband era is over. He wanted to move on from New Labour, but it brought only defeat. It was a campaign where Ed Miliband seemed to perform but his message didn’t. Perhaps not left-wing enough for Scotland and too left for the rest of the country. Policies appealing to Labour’s core vote not enough. We have to ask the honest questions and recognise that we won’t solve the problem merely by changing the captain on the deck. If the ship’s going in the wrong direction, it is UP going in the wrong direction, it is up to us to change the direction of the ship. The stumble perhaps a metaphor for a campaign where voters with unimpressed by his failure to admit he spent too much. The Labour Party end today 100 seats behind the Conservative Party. This is a big blow for the Labour Party. We failed to offer a convincing vision of the future, which spoke to the personal aspirations of families up and down Britain. Mr Miliband will now have to find somewhere to put the Ed stone, a new carving with the worst Labour result since 1987 might be more appropriate. Now Labour must again rebuild. Front runners include Yvette Cooper, whose husband Ed Balls lost his seat, Andy Burnham, Chukka Umanna and Danjarvis. For Ed Miliband, questions about whether he was the right leader, even the right Miliband. While the voters rejected him, he still has some support. Five years as leader, six weeks campaigning, one night when Labour was demolished. Nick Clegg’s political rise had been meet York leading the Liberal Democrats -- meet York leading the Liberal Democrats -- meteoric, leading the Liberal Democrats into Government as Deputy Prime Minister afterjust Deputy Prime Minister after just five Deputy Prime Minister afterjust five years as an MP. Rarely has a politician’s popularity plummeted so rapidly. By the time he and his wife arrived in the early hours, to hear he had won his seat, he knew dozens of colleagues weren’t so lucky. It is now painfully clear that this has been a cruel and punishing night for the Liberal Democrats. Five years ago, it was all so different, side by side with David Cameron... Mr Clegg was talking about a new kind of politics. In coalition Lib Dem ministers delivered Cherished policies, tax cuts and funding for disadvantaged pupils. Some never forgave them for a U-turn on putting UP forgave them for a U-turn on putting up tuition fees. Today, they’ve fallen hard, notjust the Cabinet ministers, but Lib Dem MPs, even in traditional strong holds like the south-west of England, all swept away. So after the highs of Government, today party staff faced rejection and despair. Nick Clegg made the controversial decision to take his party into Government with the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats have paid a very heavy price. Many say history willjudge his leadership far more kindly than the votersjust have, but his leadership far more kindly than the voters just have, but that the votersjust have, but that is little consolation for the people here today. Despite the pain, colleagues insist Mr Clegg should be proud of what he’s achieved. I would like people to reflect on the fact that the man who put the national interest first and is, in my view, the decentest man in British politics, has now paid the price for that. Nick Clegg has said farewell, but some fear voters loss of trust in the party forjoining forces with the Conservatives may have set the liberal cause several decades. The man who promised a political earthquake, in the end delivered a tremor and after failing to win himself a seat in Westminster, Nigel Farage kept his promise and quit as Ukip’s leader, but he left the door open for a future return. I intend to take the summer off. There will be a leadership election for the next leader of Ukip in September. I will consider over the course of the summer whether to put my name forward to do thatjob again. So there are still questions over his future. REPORTER: Is this just a summer holiday? No. Is this a resignation or a break? holiday? No. Is this a resignation ora break? I’vejust holiday? No. Is this a resignation or a break? I’vejust resigned as leader of Ukip. Mr Farage said it was a weight off his shoulders but admitted professional disappointment at the outcome of the election. 3. 9 million people voted for Ukip. It came third in terms of number of votes, but that translated into just one MP and he used his victory speech to say the voting system must change. Approximately four times more people voted eitherfor the Greens or Ukip than for the SNP and yet the SNP is expected to get many more times the representation. So do those who supported Ukip agree? Lots of people voted for Ukip, but they’ve only got one seat in the House. That’s how it happens. Unless you change the whole system it won’t make any difference. Theess stem -- the system is broke. It should be per portional representation. Neitherel ammed his team have worked -- Nigeland his team have Neitherel ammed his team have worked -- Nigel and his team have worked so hard and nothing. The campaign had no grand tour or stream of policy announcements, it focussed on core messages in key seats and that didn’t win it as many as hoped. For now, without its front man, Ukip has to find a way to move on and some campaign messages have taken on a whole new meaning. In Wales, Plaid Cymru made no gains, but the Conservatives are celebrating their best election result for 30 years. One of the seats they took, Gower, had been in Labour hands for more than a century. The results in Northern Ireland leave the Democratic Unionists as the largest party. In a moment, we’ll hear from Chris Buckler in Belfast, but first, Hywel Griffith on election night in Wales. This report contains flash photography. The last time the Tories did this well in Wales, these MPs were still in school. Since 1983, the party has been to a electoral oblivion and back here. Now, they have a growing force. Are we going to be sharing an office? Last time Labour did this badly in Wales, there was a Kinnock in charge. This election has sent another to the Commons, Stephen, son of Neil and husband to the Danish Prime Minister. Labour is still the largest party. Wales remains a stronghold. But what this election reveals is that the party isn’t mobilising its support on the ground, while coming under attack on one side from Ukip, and on the other from Plaid Cymru. The campaign put its leader in the spotlight like never before, winning fans outside of Wales, but no new seats within it. People now know what Plaid Cymru stands for. But they have not voted for it? Well, not yet, perhaps. But next year’s assembly elections, I think, will be different. Wales may not have seen swings on a Scottish scale. With these results took a shape no one here predicted. The Democratic Unionist party have positioned themselves as potential kingmakers in this election.

Of course, a lecturer or success comes at the expense of others. The cross community Alliance Party lost its only MP. Despite pressure on the SDLP’s leader in south Belfast, the nationalist party retained all three of its seats. And, having been wiped out in the last parliamentary election, the Ulster Unionist Party back in Westminster. One of their two victories was in a constituency which Sinn Fein won byjust four votes last time. And with such a slim majority, the Conservatives, at times, they look to rely on Unionist support, or simply on the fact that Sinn Fein will not take their four seats in the Commons. Away from the drama of the election, early this afternoon, yards down that way, senior politicians gathered with veterans of the Second World War to mark the 70th anniversary of VE Day. A two-minute silence was held to remember the sacrifices made during the Second World War. On an extraordinary day at Westminster, a pause for national silence, time to reflect on the terrible cost of victory in Europe over Hitler’s Nazis. Prince Andrew laid the first of many wreathes. Watched by more tan 100 veterans, among them Harold Bradley, who fought from the D-Day beaches into Germany. When I met him at home in Kent, the gunner told me why it was so important to be at the Cenotaph. That’s very easy to answer, to think one, how lucky I have been, but also, to remember those that didn’t come back. There were one or two that were very close. ARCHIVE: Six long years... May 8th, 70 years ago, it was a day of rejoicing. More than a million people took to the streets, after Winston Churchill announced that war in Europe was finally at an end. Hostilities will end officially at one minute after midnight tonight, Tuesday, the 8th of May. We may allow ourselves a brief period of rejoicing. We may allow ourselves a brief period of rejoicing. We must now devote all our strength and resources to the completion of our task, both at home and abroad. One veteran, who certainly remembers his brief period of rejoicing is Ken Wilkinson, RAF fighter pilot. Now 96, he flew Spitfires, but that May 8, 1945, he was up in a hurricane, with his radio tuned to the BBC forces programme. The news came on that the war was over, VE. Sol programme. The news came on that the war was over, VE. So I did a great big barrel roll around the Wellington bomber, landed back down and went to the nearest boozer that was selling beer and had a few. Over the weekend, many of these veterans will be at the centre of a host of events as remembrance gives way to celebration and thanks giving. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Alex Deakin. The rain hasjust about held off here. Yes, warming up overthe next few days but not necessarily sunny everywhere. Rain around tonight. It’s a damp start tomorrow. But stick with it. Brighter skies for many of us by the afternoon. This tends to fade, this large area of rain through the night. It’s a blustery night along the south coast. Warmer night than recent nights. Double digits in the south. Clear eskies in Scotland, a touch of frost in possible here. We start the weekend with sunshine here. Elsewhere it’s a grey start to Saturday, with some outbreaks of rain and drizzle. A few sharp showers drift through southern areas. We keep a few showers into the afternoon across the east. For many, it brightens up. There’ll be afternoon sunshine. Temperatures into the mid-teens for many. Maybe 18 or 19 across the South-East. Warm across central and eastern areas on Sunday, with sunshine here, but further west and further north, there will be cloud and outbreaks of rain. Perhaps turning warmer by Monday. That’s all from me after an extraordinary day that’s changed the political landscape. Now Tonight on BBC London News: Going, going, gone. The Lib Dems are all but wiped out in London, losing some of their longest serving MPs. Unfortunately, this has been a terrible night for our party. I am absolutely sure that we are going to bounce back, both nationally and locally. I am surprised but I am sad because he was a very good MP for us. An island of red in a sea of blue. Labour bucks the national trend to increase its London seats. What next for Boris johnson? We follow the Mayor’s fortunes as he returns to Westminster as an MP. And IM back on board the BBC election boat to hear what swung it for our panel. -- I am election boat to hear what swung it for our panel. -- Iam back. Good evening. Welcome to a special edition of BBC London News. Here we are overlooking the Houses of Parliament on what’s turned into a devastating day for the Liberal Democrats, all but wiped out here in the capital. And while nationally the Tories dominate, in London, it’s Labour who stole the lead. Our Political Correspondent Karl Mercer now reports on how the drama unfolded. It was not a good night to be a London Lib Dem. Everywhere you looked, they were losing seats. Six in all in the capital. After 32 years, the voters of Southwark finally decided they’d had enough of Simon Hughes. ~ I hope you think that for 32 years, I have served you well. Ed Davey, Paul Burstow and Vince Cable, in South West London found voters there just as unforgiving. It’s a bad night, yes. That’s reflected. We are little shocked because our figures were suggesting that we would do a lot better. It does seem to me that it was very much a late swing which the polls had not picked up. Tom Brake is now the only Lib Dem MP left in London. Those people will not support a party that has been in government which they see as being an established parties. We have to go back to our grassroots. Bills from the bottom-up words ensure that we start to regain some of the seats that we have lost. -- start to regain some of the seats that we have lost. -- build from the bottom up. While Labour was losing seats all over the country, it was at least winning some in London. Seven in total. A good result but not quite the 12 they had aimed for. But still possible lessons here for the national party. We’re not doing well in the country, we are doing better in London. I think that is in part because of the way in which the Labour Party campaigns in London. The Tories held off challenges in places like Battersea, Harrow, Finchley, Hendon and in Croydon Central, where Gavin Barwell won the seat by 165 votes. ~ I think you have to work really hard to reach out to the people who did not vote for you, not just celebrate the fact that you have one. My experience is that there are lots of people in this town who are naturally conservative in values but do not vote for the party. There is a lot more to do in the next five years. Outside London, Ukip had been hoping for a surge in Essex. But after a recount in Thurrock, it was the conservative jackie Doyle Price who held on. A large section of the public does feel disenfranchised. The message that Ukip was giving, particularly talking about immigration, was attractive to a lot of people. And despite launching their campaign in Castle Point, Ukip could only manage second there too. But across seats in Essex and Kent, the party saw its vote rise substantially. In the end, the map of seats around London didn’t change overnight. All blue apart from three Labour seats of Luton North and South, and Slough. No yellow there for the Lib Dems. And in London, a desperate night saw the party reduced to a one man band. So how do the upsets and gains affect the whole picture in London? Alex Bushill has the capital’s political map. Let’s bring in the political map going into this General Election. These are the result of the 2010 election. I am standing in the Labour heartland. What does that mean in terms of the number of seats per political party? The Labour Party had ten more seats than the Conservatives, coming into this election. This is now. You can see that Labour have stretched, holding 45 out of a total of 73 seats in the city. The Conservatives are down by one. The Lib Dems have had a catastrophic failure, withjust one. The Lib Dems have had a catastrophic failure, with just a single MP in the city. Let’s look at the changed seats. You can see where Labour has done particularly well. They have seen a 6% swing from the Conservatives to Labour. Further west, other notable games, including Ealing Central. There was a majority overturned 3,700. Southwest, some very notable victories. This time, Vince Cable, the Business Secretary. He has lost his seat of Twickenham to the Conservatives. An 11% swing. You can see that the Conservatives have done well, particularly in the south-west, but also in the actual boroughs. It is particularly good news for Labour. It may have been disappointing night, and it has been very good news in London. As a result of Labour gains, we can walk the length of London in Labour held territory. So that was Alex Bushill with the situation in London. But what about the surrounding counties? If we take a look at what it was like five years ago, we see the Conservatives dominating, in all but three seats. Let’s get more on the near wipe out for the Lib Dems in London. Our Political Editor Tim Donovan is in Vince Cable’s now former constituency, Twickenham. What’s the mood like there? In the autumn months before Christmas, there had been some feeling around this seats, some feeling from the Conservatives that it might come into play. They were sending down people to hand out leaflets on the high street. The candidate herself, Tania Mathias, was given quite a high profile at the party conference last autumn. She was seen wandering around with the Prime Minister and introduced Borisjohnson’s the Prime Minister and introduced Boris johnson’s keynote Borisjohnson’s keynote speech. After Christmas, that’s kind of went away. The Tories under Lib Dems have said they did not think this was really an issue any more. They thought that Vince Cable’s seat was too dark in. Something has shifted in the last days rather than weeks. -- to well-established. I am surprised, honestly but, yes, I’m sad because he was a very good MP for us. He’s been here a long, long time. I’m not very surprised. Ithink, in the run-up, the people that I spoke to felt like the Conservatives were ahead anyway. I suspect that the situation has become so parlous that people have started to vote more intelligently, using their heads rather than hearts. The Lib Dems rebuilt from here? Who knows the answer to that? This isn’t something that has happened in isolation. It is all the more serious because it does follow a pattern in local elections where they have lost some of that local activist base. They remain in control of Sutton Council, where Tom brake is based. Thank you. Earlier, I spoke to Simon Hughes, the formerjustice Minister and deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, who’s lost his seat of Bermondsey and Old Southwark after ~ I asked him why he thought his party had done so badly in London. None of us have not try to serve our constituents to the best of our ability. Vince Cable, Ed Davey, or have been great constituency MPs. I don’t think I’ve heard anyone say they haven’t done a greatjob. I hope we didn’t lose because we hadn’t served our constituents. We lost because of the National tied back to Labour and the Tories. -- the national movement. Without wishing to add salt to the Lib Dem wounds, at what point did you know that it was over? I don’t think we knew absolutely until the end of voting day. You don’t know the results. I thought it would be tight. I have had to defend this seat over many years. I suppose it wasn’t until this week that my colleagues in London realised that things were slipping away from us. People decided that they wanted either a Tory or Labour government. We will come back. What about you, personally? Having been an MP for more than 32 years, what you do next? I don’t know the answer to that question. Forthe I don’t know the answer to that question. For the first time, I am without employment. I have to face UP without employment. I have to face up to that. I am made of strong stuff. I am gratefulfor up to that. I am made of strong stuff. I am grateful for my friends and family. I haven’t a clue what the next stages yet. I’m joined now by the Conservative MP for Wimbledon, Stephen Hammond, and Andrew Slaughter, Labour MP for Hammersmith. Both who held their seats. Andy Slaughter, you’ve lost an election you should It isa It is a good result for Labour in London. It’s a tributes to the campaign and to the interaction between London MPs and electorates. It is a disaster, nationally. Ifeel very sorry for people who are going to put up with another five years of a Conservative government. You were aiming for 12. aiming for12. That was the target and we came close. It was a brilliantly run campaign in London. I think we have to pay tribute to that, and I hope we can replicate that around the country next time. This message that we have heard time and time again about the long-term economic plan working, yet in London, where it is driving the economy, I’m curious that you didn’t make more games. It is disappointing to lose for great colleagues. As you have pointed out, I was told would be going to lose huge number of seats in London. We actually have three new colleagues coming into south-west London. We gave hope on childcare and on building new houses, which was a message that was powerful to Londoners. So you see a net loss of one Londoners are pretty good result? I would like to have seen all of my colleagues state, obviously, but I think that considering everyone was telling me, Ithink think that considering everyone was telling me, I think we have done well. Three fabulous gains last night. Thoughts will inevitably turn to Labour leadership. With Labour bucking the national trend in London, could we see the next Labour leader, from London? Ifl London, could we see the next Labour leader, from London? If I say the names and you blink? I think it is too early to talk about that. We campaigned on the issues in London. My constituents are about losing their hospitals. They’re worried about the fact that nobody can afford housing in London. That is why we won seats. Perhaps they would be reassured if the Labour leader was from London? Who knows? My constituents want to talk about the fact that they are on 0-hours contracts, that the NHS is not working for them, and that they do not have houses that they can afford. As final word from Stephen Hammond, talking of party leadership, what kinds of roles you think Boris johnson has played in this campaign? He has been extremely helpful in putting out the message. We are building new houses, investing in transport. The Prime Minister led an outstanding campaign. Congratulations to you both under seats. Thank you for coming in and joining us. -- on your seats. So what do Londoners make of the result? Well, throughout the campaign we’ve been hearing from a panel of floating voters. Some of them are on board the BBC London ‘election boat’ with Katharine Carpenter tonight. What’s the reaction been? Welcome on board. It is a rather gloomy evening here on the Thames. That’s a pretty accurate reflection of the mood here. That speaks to some of our voters. You voted for Labour. They did better in the capital than elsewhere, but I know you are worried. Yes. I really like Diana and it is good to see her when my local seat, and I feel like we’re in for a bleak five years. I wanted to see a compassionate leader in Number Ten and I feel like the politics of fear has one. You also voted up for Labour. You are a bit more positive. I am. I voted Labour because our local MP, Margaret Hodge, is related. I hope the Tories take this as an opportunity to move beyond the one class politics to really include everyone. If Labour didn’t do as well as hoped, it is a terrible night for the Lib Dems. Simon Hughes lost his seatjust up the river here. You voted for the Lib Dems. Yes, Simon Hughes was very sincere and genuine. You decide to see so many good MPs no longer in Parliament. It feels like people have done the right thing by keeping that packs between Labour and the SNP. It does seem to have been an election of fear. Moving on. Simon, you made a protest vote for Ukip here in Westminster. It was a wasted vote, wasn’t it? I was in a strong Conservative hold but I felt the need to vote for Ukip. It is reassuring that 14% of the population have voted Ukip. I really hope that David Cameron and a Conservative government can take that on board, in terms of recognising that a lot of the population has thought of those policies. Family, you voted Conservative. You release? I am feeling surprised. I didn’t think they would get a majority. -- Emily. You voted conservative anti-work in the city. It was a last-minute kind of sense of the safest thing. -- the city. It was a last-minute kind of sense of the safest thing. -- and you work in the city. Yes, I spoke to my daughter and said that I needed a new lawn mower. She asked me why because it was working just fine. Unemployment is falling, why change it? Thank you. just a snapshot of use from here on the river. Plenty more to pick about what all this means for London. -- to pick about what all this means for London. -- a snapshot of opinions. The Mayor of London has an additionaljob as of today - MP for Uxbridge and Ruislip South. Boris johnson won the safe Conservative seat, as predicted, with a majority of more than 10,000. Gareth Furby followed him every inch of the way as he made his return to the House of Commons. ~ I hereby declare that Borisjohnson is duly elected. He wins his seat and his role in Conservative victory may have been significant. From the start, he was deployed in target seats and encountered a Labour ambush target seats and encountered a Labourambush in Labour ambush in Kilburn. Is this an ambush? No, it is democracy in action. Don’t come back! He often arrives late. In Ealing, some supporters got a bit bothered. When he turned up, it seemed that everyone wanted a selfie. Is he a celebrity? Did that mean votes? Are you going to vote conservative? Absolutely. Sometimes Boris got a bit confused. Vote Green! I mean, vote Tory, obviously. About halfway through the campaign, a strategy emerged. Using Boris and his image as a tactical weapon. We like Sean Connery. Is Boris the secret weapon? He reaches the other parts of voters that the normal politician doesn’t. Some people were asking whether all this campaigning meant that he had too much on his plate. In Uxbridge, his constituency, there was unhappiness when he missed a hustings. Are you coming to this hustings tonight? Oh, yes. Ijust think it’s disrespectful. It is only Boris that hasn’t arrived yet. Is so confident that he doesn’t need to belittle himself to come here to us minions. He might be in fora himself to come here to us minions. He might be in for a shock. But he took the seat and the Conservatives won. And now attention may turn to a possibility of-- often mentioned during his campaign. You can run for Prime Minister. Prime Minister to be. But now David Cameron is staying in Downing Street and Borisjohnson is again an MP. A senior ministerial position is a possibility for a man who wore socks on the campaign, when he visited a mosque. He had to be reminded about his appearance. And he provoked emotional scenes on the streets. Why can’t you answer these questions? Many observers may think the Mayor has had a good election campaign and his political ascendancy may now continue. Let’s go back to Tim Donovan. What now for Boris johnson as MP and Mayor? No one is in any doubt about his leadership foundations. It is the question of how he achieves them. Opinion is still split. -- leadership ambitions. Some people think he needs to become more part of government and build up parliamentary support. Others say that perhaps his moment could have passed with David Cameron’s authority enhanced, not diminished, and possibly some of his allies similarly. There is a question about whether he will get the ministerialjob. He said he would not take a cabinet post until he had served out his May oral term. He might take something like party chairman. -- He might take something like party chairman. -- his term as Mayor. What happens next year when he is doing these two jobs? happens next year when he is doing these twojobs? An these two jobs? An unusually phrased response from the Chamber of Commerce. Now the Mayor is leading a double life, the lights in London seem to be switching off. London needs a full-time Mayor. Thank you. That’s not forget the weather. We are going to see an improving weather story through the course of the weekends. Some spring into next weekend. A bit brighter and warmer, but quite a lot of cloud at the moment. Drizzly rain this evening and overnight. Most of us will start the early hours of Saturday morning without any frost. There will be quite a lot of cloud through the course of the morning. A slowly improving day. Some spells of sunshine breaking through the cloud. Some showers around the middle part of the day. They should ease away towards the east by the afternoon. Temperatures getting up to 19 degrees. It should feel fairly pleasant. We ended the day on a dry note. A fine evening on Saturday. On Sunday morning, a dry start with a little bit of clouds. A frost free morning. Through the day on Sunday, the cloud will thin and break. A little bit of sunshine. High pressure pushing in from the south which will take charge of our weather to the course of Sunday. A cloudy story on Sunday but some spells of sunshine around. Temperatures around 18 or 19 degrees. It should be fine in the sunshine. Thank you. That’s it from us. Conservatives have won a majority, and the Liberal Democrats have almost been wiped out in London. Plenty more on the day’s extraordinary results on our website, of course.

29,BBC News 24,8-may-2015,BBC News at Ten,22:00,45 mins,True,"Tonight at Ten, David Cameron has defied pollsters and pundits by winning an overall majority at Westminster. Mr Cameron is the first Conservative leader to win a majority for over 20 years, and he promised his new government would seek to unify the country. I truly believe we are on the brink of something special in our country. We can make Britain a place where a good life is in reach of everyone who is willing to work and do the right thing. For Labour, deep disappointment. There were dozens of losses, which led to the resignation of the party leader, Ed Miliband. I take absolute and total responsibility for the results and our defeat at this election. I’m so sorry for all of those colleagues who lost their seats. And an even worse outcome for the Lib Dems - they lost all but eight of their seats and they too will be looking for a new leader. Clearly the results have been immeasurably more crushing and unkind than I could ever have feared. And a third party leader stood down, when Nigel Farage of Ukip failed to win his seat in Kent. In Scotland, the most dramatic sweep of the night, as the SNP crushed Labour and took all but three of the country’s seats. The Scottish lion has roared this morning across the country. And veterans and politicians gathered to mark the 70th anniversary of VE Day. After today’s dramatic eve nts, After today’s dramatic events, we will have all the fallout from the election here on the BBC News Channel. We’ll be live in Westminster and Downing Street. Good evening from Downing Street where David Cameron is embarking on a second term as Prime Minister. But this time, having defied the pollsters and pundits, he’s leading a majority Conservative government. His former coalition partners, the Liberal Democrats, were crushed at the polls. Labour also suffered heavy losses, most of them inflicted by the SNP, which enjoyed sweeping success right across Scotland. Mr Cameron has pledged to govern as a one-nation Conservative to bring the UK together. So this is the final tally. The Conservatives have 331 seats. Labour have 232. The SNP took 56 of the 59 seats in Scotland. The Liberal Democrats lost A9 seats, leaving them with just eight. Turnout was 66%. Nick Robinson, whose voice is recovering after recent surgery, has our first report tonight on what turned out to be a remarkable Conservative victory. His report contains flash photography. No pollster, no pundit, no political leaders lead coming. Not even David Cameron himself. Another trip to the palace to be invited to serve as Prime Minister for another five years. But this time not after any deal and not in a coalition. I have just been to see Her Majesty The Queen and I will now form a majority Conservative government. Having achieved what seemed to be mission impossible, he could afford to a date to two soon-to-be ex-party leaders whose hopes he crushed. I have been proud to lead the first Coalition Government in 70 years and want to thank those who made it a success, and in particular Nick Clegg. Ed Miliband rang me this morning to wish me luck with the new government. It was a typically generous gesture from someone who is clearly in public service for all the right reasons. And the man who warned again and again about the threat posed by the SNP also had soothing words about the need to rebuild one nation. I have always believed in governing with respect. That is why in the last parliament we devolved power to Scotland and Wales and give the people of Scotland a referendum on whether to stay part of the United Kingdom. I will stage a word and implement as fast asl Kingdom. I will stage a word and implement as fast as I can the devolution that all parties agreed for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Cameron’s children call this the pretend home. They will be living in it for an awful lot longer. They and the Downing Street staff who greeted them can scarcely believe it. Election night, after the race that was meant to be too close to call, again with a shock. We are seeing that the Conservatives are the largest party. The Tories were going to gain seats since last time. Labour would lose them. It isa them. It is a quite sensational story. Sensational. An extraordinary night if that Paul is correct. I didn’t believe it and neither did they. If this exit poll is right, but publicly eat my hat. I will it my kilt. A Tory victory against Labour in Nuneaton, the first sign that kilt and hit eating mate prove necessary. The symbol of how bad it was, defeat for the man expected to be our next Chancellor. Labour’s other Ed has notjoined the ranks of the unemployed at this morning he did quit hisjob as Labour leader. Having done worse than his old boss Gordon Brown did five years ago. I am truly sorry I did not succeed. I have done my best for nearly five years. Now you need to show your responsibility. Your responsibility, not simply to mourn our defeat, but to pick yourself up and continue the fight. We have come back before and this party will come back again. And Labour also lost the man meant to be the next Foreign Secretary. Defeated by a 20-year-old SNP student. Scotland has chosen to oppose this Conservative government not place that trust and the Labour Party. A tidal wave of support for the SNP made Scotland almost a 1-party state. That means that he is heading back to Westminster with 55 others whose dream is that one day soon Scotland should have no seats in the Commons at all. The Scottish lion has wrought this morning across the country. -- The Scottish lion has wrought this morning across the country. -- Road. Road. One woman had come to dominate it. I think it is courtesy that the tectonic plates shifted last night -- fair to say. After the -- fairto say. After the Lib -- fairto say. Afterthe Lib Dem’s After the Lib Dem’s devastating losses reduced their numbers to eight. Out went minister after minister after minister with even the Vince Cable losing his seat. You might have thought they had little to cheer about except perhaps that their leader had survived. Even if he to resign. Clearly the results have been immeasurably more crushing and -- and and kind than we hoped and for that I should take responsibility and will be resigning. This is a very dark day for our party. But we cannot and will not allow decent liberal values to be extinguished overnight. Nigel Farage’s Ukip won almost A million votes, many more than the SNP, but the elected just one MP and it wasn’t him. You wait for one leader to resign and along comes the day all at once. I am a man of my word sol day all at once. I am a man of my word so I shall be writing to the Ukip national executive in a few minutes seeing that I am standing down as leader of Ukip. just hours after learning their fate and trading better insults, the paid tribute to the war dead on the 70th anniversary of the EDF. -- tribute to the war dead on the 70th anniversary of the EDF. -- VE Day. This was her day but above all headers. David Cameron’s victory one that few people believed was possible. The unexpected majority win for the Conservatives represents a significant personal victory for David Cameron. The Prime Minister secured his party’s first outright win for 23 years. So what lies ahead for the new Conservative government? Gavin Hewitt considers that and the party’s winning strategy. It wasjust after It was just after seven o’clock when David Cameron arrived at party headquarters to thank his staff for what he called the sweetest victory. The real reason to be excited is that we are going to get the opportunity to serve our country again. Arriving just before, Lynton Crosby, the election strategist. At every campaign stop, the plan was to go after Labour’s credibility and the letter they left. I’m afraid there is no money. That is what Labour left. Another strategist argued that campaigns had to be about the future and needed positive messages. The Tories also found an issue potentially damaging to Labour, that they would be potentially dependent on the SNP. They fully exploited this. Downing Street staff were applauding but two weeks ago there was a wobble and David Cameron was told to inject some passion into the campaign. The Tories went after marginal seats in the South West. The seats that have got David Cameron to 331 are essentially the seats of his Liberal Democratjunior coalition partners. David Cameron’s advisers always believed the campaign would be settled in the last few hours. It is all about the economy. An enormous amount of people who could have been tempted to abstain or go to Ukip decided that the risk of getting Miller band and Ed Balls in college and with the SMP -- of getting Miller band and Ed Balls in college and with the SMP -- Ed Miliband and Ed Balls with the SNP wasjust too much Miliband and Ed Balls with the SNP was just too much to take. His majority is tiny, smaller than john Major’s in 1982. It could tempt some backbenchers to be rebellious. He will need a lot of political cooperation and agreement with them but we cannot be part of their political union. David Cameron’s short-term authority is immense. This was a formidable personal achievement. After such an extraordinary 24 hours, let’s talk to our political editor, Nick Robinson. You could not hide your surprise. I be any wiser as to what happened? Even more than scepticism if I am honest. Nobody really expected to see this day. Even the civil servants had set up teams and book rooms and even ordered the sandwiches for those talks that we thought we would see after an uncertain result. Even after the exit poll, the Tories and Labour started to rehearse their arguments about how they had one in an uncertain result. Surely a governing party that cut and missed more cuts would not win a majority. So what did happen? Partly, they crushed the coalition partners. Brittle but they did it. Partly Nigel Farage lost an MP despite winning all those votes. Partly Labour managed to perform not just worse than Gordon Brown but equal with Neil Kinnock. And then Scotland and that extraordinary success for the SNP. just one question, how do they now live together? Will he end up eating the last Prime Minister of this United Kingdom or she become the first first ministers of an independent Scotland. As we mentioned, the political landscape was transformed overnight by the Scottish National Party which achieved an unprecedented set of results, taking dozens of seats from Labour, who are left withjust one Scottish MP. Let’sjoin Gavin Esler in Glasgow. Thanks, Huw, and welcome to Glasgow on a day when even rock solid Labour majorities were swept away by the SNP. Behind me, the Glasgow Central constituency, its 10,000 Labour majority gone. Gordon Brown’s constituency had a 23,000 Labour majority. That’s gone too. The sheer scale of what’s happened is onlyjust sinking in. james Cook has this assessment of the SNP landslide. Waiting to make history. It’s 2:20am and the Scottish National Party has just pulled off a stunning coup. The Nationalists have unseated the Shadow Foreign Secretary, Douglas Alexander. They can’t quite believe it, but in seat after seat across Scotland it’s the same story. It’s historic. The political firmament, the tectonic plates of Scottish politics have shifted tonight. What we are seeing is a historic watershed. The new MP for Paisley, who defeated Mr Alexander, is a 20-year-old student. For her, this was a moment of emotion and pride. Mhairi Black is the youngest Member of Parliament since the 19th century. People are switched on. Political spin doesn’t work any more. They are looking for high-quality arguments and genuine representation and genuine change. Clydeside is not red any more. Glasgow, like much of Scotland has been painted yellow. True, but Britain as a whole has turned blue and Nicola Sturgeon’s 56 MPs will be sitting on the opposition benches. We put ending austerity at the top of our agenda when we published our manifesto. That’s our number one priority. The Government has to listen to what has happened in Scotland. There has been an overwhelming vote against continued austerity. For Labour, this is simply a calamity. One MP in Scotland. The party lost seats with majorities of more than 20,000, breaking British political records. Even the leader couldn’t cling on. Why? We were hit by two nationalisms. A Scottish nationalism reassuring people they could vote SNP and get Labour. And an English nationalism, stoked up by David Cameron warning that a vote for Labour would get the SNP. Are you resigning, given that you’ve just presided over the most catastrophic performance your party has ever put in in Scotland, and if not, why not? I said last night at the election count in what is now my former constituency that the fightback begins and I’m determined to still be part of that fightback. For half a century or more, the Labour movement has towered above Scottish politics. Now it lies in ruins. What on earth canjim Murphy do to rebuild it? Well done. On you go. The SNP boss, meanwhile, is insisting this election was not about independence. But plenty of her supporters want it back on the agenda. Tonight, Scotland and England look like very different countries. james Cook, BBC News, Glasgow. Well, this is the biggest political change anyone here can remember. But some are already asking what the SNPs 56 MPs can realistically achieve up against a Conservative majority at Westminster. I’ve been gauging the mood among some of the voters. Glasgow, once the heart of red Clydeside, today firmly SNP yellow. Around the city centre the symbols of past British glory, and voters reflecting on the Scottish political revolution. Absolutely delighted, think it’s wonderful. I have just come in the train from Stirling, and the atmosphere was leaden. I expected to be rejoicing but it is absolutely leaden. I don’t enjoy living in a one-party state, so I’m going to have to consider my position as to whether I stay in Scotland. Scotland never votes for the Conservatives but they end up with a Conservative Government all the time. What do you think of the fact the SNP have won just about every seat in Scotland? I don’t think it will make a blind bit of difference. Go anywhere in Scotland and people will tell you that the three main Westminster parties are like three different sets of waiters who are serving up precisely the same kind of meal, and it’s time to change the menu. In Govan, where once they made big ships, now it is shoes, including for Rod Stewart, Sir Alex Ferguson and for export. I think it doesn’t matter who is in, we are just going to have to fight for everything we want. Scotland is going to have to fight for everything they want. Steven Rogers switched from Labour to the SNP. How much power does Scotland really have in Westminster? We’ve done as much as we can but the rest was in England’s hands and they chose what they chose. Brian Curry’s family own the company, which has many English customers. He’s hands-on and wants the SNP to be constructive at Westminster. Like any Scot, I want to see Scotland get the best deal they can. Hopefully David Cameron will realise that Scotland has voted SNP, they are obviously not happy with what has gone on in the past. Hopefully he is now going to have to build bridges. The big question now, what influence can be SNP have at Westminster? And for Scottish Labour, a rescue plan - change or die. I’m joined by our Scotland Political Editor, Brian Taylor. 56 SMP seats and -- SNP seats with a majority. What will happen? For Scotland, they are aware that we are looking for practical politics. The Prime Minister has a conundrum. He can tell the SNP to get lost and exercise his Parliament majority, and his backbenchers want that, but equally he can’t ignore the growl of this quiet coming from Scotland. He doesn’t want to jeopardise the very union that his party has pledged to defend. A remarkable conundrum on both sides. A the men to stay here, and David Cameron has to work out how his Government could deal with that massive group, the SNP. Thanks Gavin. By lunch time today no fewer than three party leaders - Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg and Nigel Farage - had all announced their resignations. In a moment, Vicki Young will report on a devastating night for the Liberal Democrats and Alex Forsyth will have the latest on UKIP but first, Lucy Manning, who’s been tracking the Labour campaign, reports on the events that led to Mr Miliband’s resignation. There is some flash photography coming up. There was much to cry about. Massive losses in Scotland, the lost battle in Tory marginals, the loss of three Shadow Cabinet members and the lost opportunity to try and form a government. Still, they cheered him in, looking exhausted, but this was far from the victory rally they’d envisaged. I take absolute and total responsibility for the result and our defeat at this election. I’m so sorry for all of those colleagues who lost their seats. So the Ed Miliband era is over. He wanted to move on from New Labour but it brought only defeat. It was a campaign where Ed Miliband seemed to perform, but his message didn’t. Perhaps not left-wing enough for Scotland and too left for the rest of the country. Policies appealing to Labour’s core vote just not enough. You have to generate policies that speak to what people feel about their lives and of course it is important the Labour Party doesn’t tear itself apart but there has to be a real, honest, fundamental assessment of why we got to where we are today, which is not a very good place. Unlike last night, there was a time he defeated a frontrunner called David but since then, voters had doubts on policies, with his message on state intervention, on taxing the rich and on personality. Tonight, his brother tweeted to say his heart went out to Ed. And maybe this stumble a metaphor for a campaign where voters were unimpressed to by his failure to accept accusations Labour spent too much. The Labour Party ends today 100 seats behind the Conservative Party. This is a really big blow for the Labour Party. I think we failed to offer a convincing vision of the future, which spoke to the personal aspirations of families up and down Britain. Mr Miliband will now have to find somewhere to put the Ed Stone, a new carving with, ""The worst Labour result since I987"", might be more appropriate. So now Labour must again rebuild. Frontrunners include Yvette Cooper whose husband Ed Balls lost his seat, Shadow Health Secretary, Andy Burnham. Chucka Umunna, Shadow Business Secretary, and former soldier, Dan jarvis. For Ed Miliband, the good humour he showed during the campaign seemed to have returned. And he still has some support. I’m going to see my wife and kids. Five years as leader, six weeks campaigning, one night when Labour was demolished. Nick Clegg’s political rise had been meteoric, leading the Liberal Democrats into Government as Deputy Prime Minister afterjust five years as an MP. But rarely has a politician’s popularity plummeted so rapidly. By the time he and his wife arrived in Sheffield Hallam in the By the time he and his wife arrived in Sheffield Hallam in the early hours to hear that he had won his seat, he already knew dozens of his colleagues hadn’t been so lucky. It is now painfully clear that this has been a cruel and punishing night for the Liberal Democrats. Five years ago, it was alL so different. Side-by-side with David Cameron, Mr Clegg was talking about a new kind of politics. In coalition, Lib Dem ministers delivered cherished policies. Tax cuts and funding for disadvantaged pupils. We made a pledge, we didn’t stick to it and for that I’m sorry. But some never forgave him for a U-turn on putting up tuition fees, despite a public apology. Today, they’ve fallen hard. Notjust the Cabinet ministers but Lib Dem MPs, even in traditional strongholds like the south-west of England. All swept away. So after the highs of Government, today party staff faced rejection and despair. Nick Clegg made the controversial decision to take his party into Government with the Conservatives, and the Liberal Democrats have paid a very heavy price. Many say that history willjudge his leadership far more for the people here today. Despite the pain, colleagues insist Mr Clegg should be proud of what he’s achieved. I would like people to reflect on the fact that the man who put the national interest first and is in my view the most decent man in British politics, has now paid the price for that. Nick Clegg has said farewell but some fear voters’ loss of trust in the party are joining forces with the Conservatives may have set the Liberal cause back several decades. The man who promised a political earthquake in the end delivered a a tremor and after failing to win himself a seat in Westminster, Nigel Farage kept his promise and quit as Ukip’s leader but he left the door open for a future return. I intend to take the summer off and there will be a leadership election for the next leader of Ukip in September and I will consider, over the course of this summer, whether to put my name forward to do thatjob again. So there are still questions over his future. REPORTER: Is this just a summer holiday? No I haven’t. What is this, a resignation or a short break? I have just resigned as leader of Ukip. Mr Farage said it was a weight off his shoulders but admitted professional disappointment at the outcome of the election. 3.9 million people voted for Ukip, it came third in terms of number of votes but that translated intojust one MP and he used his victory speech to say the voting system much change. Approximately four times more people voted either for the Greens or for Ukip than for the SNP and yet the SNP is expected to get many more times the representation. So, do those who support Ukip agree? Lots of people voted for Ukip but they only have one seat. I know, that’s how it happens, unless you change the whole system it won’t make any difference. The system is broke! there should be proportional representation. Nigel has worked so hard, his team has worked so hard and nothing. Without the infrastructure of the larger parties, the Ukip campaign has no grand tour or stream of policy announcements. It focussed on core messages in key seats and that didn’t win it as many had hoped. So for now, without its frontman, Ukip has to find a way to move on, and some campaign messages have taken on a new meaning. So let’s take a closer look at the results that started to come in during the early hours and pointed to an outright win for David Cameron. Here’sjeremy Vine with his guide to all the key numbers, seats and parties. How did the Conservatives pave a path to Number Ten? Let me take you down our virtual Downing Street and show you. Here we have a line marked 326, the number of seats a party needs to send its leader through the door. All the expectations were that the two main parties would fail, but the Conservatives have confounded them. Watch their seats come on, watch them pave the path. And this is how they did it. Firstly, and crucially, they held their own marginal seats, like Ipswich and Hendon, the ones that were Labour targets. Secondly, they ruthlessly, brutally took the seats of their coalition partners, the Lib Dems. St Ives down here, for example, and Kingston. Thirdly, most surprising of all, they were taking Labour seats from Labour. Plymouth Moor View here, or Telford, or even Morley and outwood, right at the end, the seat of the Shadow Chancellor, Ed Balls. And Labour were far behind on 232. Here they are. And a worse result even than the one they had under Gordon Brown in 2010. So let me show you our virtual House of Commons and let’s put the MPs on the benches. The Conservatives first. They have a majority of 12. Now Labour, who will struggle to find a leader to replace Ed Miliband. That’s the first thing they have to do when they return to Westminster. The SNP have had a storming night, up 50 seats. The only problem for them is that they would have thought Labour would end up with more leverage after this election, so the leverage they wanted with Labour counts for little. The Lib Dems, by contrast with the SNP, have done terribly, dropping A9 seats. Nick Clegg, of course, resigning. And then the other parties as well. Let’s see them. Plaid Cymru, three seats. The Greens, one seat, Caroline Lucas returned in Brighton Pavilion. And Ukip winning their first MP at a general election, Douglas Carswell in Clacton. Plus the others in Northern Ireland, 18. A third of the House of Commons is now female MPs. The remarkable thing about this result, though, was that hardly anyone predicted this. It was an extraordinary election, because the outcome was so unexpected. In Wales, where Plaid Cymru made no gains, the Conservatives celebrated their best election for 30 years. One of the seats they took, Gower, had been in Labour hands for more than a century. The results in Northern Ireland leave the Democratic Unionists as the largest party. In a moment we’ll hear from Chris Buckler in Belfast but first Hywel Griffith on election night in Wales. The last time the Tories did this well in Wales, these MPs were still in school. They have been to the brink of oblivion and back here and I know the growing force. The last time we’ll stood this badly in Wales, there was a Kennett in charge. -- in Wales, there was a Kennett in charge. -- Neil Kinnock. Wales remains a stronghold but what this election reveals is that the party isn’t mobilising support on the ground. Well coming under attack from Ukip on one side and Plaid Cymru on the other. They won fans outside of Wales but no new seats within it. People now know what Plaid Cymru stands for. But they have not voted for it. Not yet but next year’s assembly elections will be different. These results took a shave predicted. The Democratic Unionist party predicted themselves as potential kingmakers in this election. In the event, the Conservatives did not need their help but the resultant shirt the DUP would continue their reign as the biggest party in Northern Ireland. I think it is clear that the majority of Northern Ireland -- I think it is clear that the majority of Northern Ireland -- the majority shows that there will be times where we are required. Despite pressure on the SDLP’s leader in south Belfast, the National ice party retained all play a bit seats. Having been wiped out in the last election, the Ulster Unionists are back at Westminster. One of theirtwo Unionists are back at Westminster. One of their two victories was in a constituency that Sinn Fein one by -- won by four votes last time. David Cameron came back to Downing Street today, saying he wanted above all to ""bring the country together"" as a one-nation Conservative. But he’ll face conflicting demands with his own backbenchers asking for a much bigger say for England and the SNP wanting more powers for Scotland. The political map of the new dilated kingdom. Each constituency of equal size. But the UK looks very different depending on British stand, online sent the view is a sea of blue, from john Gross, a sea of yellow. The challenge for David Cameron is to prevent the United Kingdom being torn apart by mutual resentment. Resentment from Scotland at a Westminster government dominated by English Tories and resentment from England as what they see as preferential treatment given to the Scots. The future of the net to kingdom lies in the balance again. I want to reclaim her mantle we never lost -- I want to reclaim her mantle we never lost -- never should have lost. That we are one United Kingdom. The Prime Minister area treated the boat made to the Scottish people last year. Maintaining the controversial Barnett Formula. There is potential devolution to Wales and Northern Ireland as well. There has to be some sort of federal offer. Everybody needs to take a deep breath, think about how we want the United Kingdom to progress. As much as David Cameron might want to seal the wounds with the electorate in Scotland, he has also promised what he calls fairness for England. This is a really critical moment for the union. We have set up competing nationalism is within the UK of England versus Scotland and it is vital early in the new parliament to refuse all of that. At this damp racecourse, some are pondering whether the first past the post voting system in national elections was another constitutional question that needs resolving. The SNP got one and a half million votes and 156 seats. Ukip palled almost A million votes and have just one. I think there are voters out there wasting votes. Me included. It shows that first past the post doesn’t work. Proportional representation would have brought a fair result. David Cameron’s last government source the rejection of independence and voting reform but neither of thoseissues and voting reform but neither of those issues has gone away. And you can find out about the result in your constituency by visiting bbc.co.uk/election2015 and going to the results section, where you can put in your postcode to get the details. Earlier today politicians joined veterans of the Second World War at the Cenotaph in Whitehall to mark the 70th anniversary of VE Day, when victory in Europe was declared in May 1945. A chain of beacons has been lit tonight around the UK - the first by the Queen at Windsor. james Robbins is there. This beacon is burning brightly. I can feel the heat of it and the gas burners spell out the letter V for victory. It is the first of some 200 beacons let up and down the country tonight to honour that remarkable wartime generation. Those who died and those who survived to bear witness. I should warn you that the report contains flash photography. Wartime Britain was also lacquered Britain. The Queen triggering the first in a series of beacons across the nation is therefore a powerful reminder of what it meant to emerge from six years of war survival. The climax of this day of remembrance. On an extraordinary day at Westminster, a pause for a national silence. Time to reflect on the terrible cost of victory in Europe over at the’s Nazis. -- terrible cost of victory in Europe over at the’s Nazis. -- Adolf Hitler’s Nazis. Watched by more than 100 veterans. Among them Harold Bradley, who fought on the D-Day beaches. He told me why it was so important to be at the Cenotaph. That is very easy to answer. To think how lucky I have been but also to remember those that did not come back. There were one or two that were very close. For most, 8th of May 70 years ago was a day of rejoicing. Winston Churchill announced that war in Europe was finally over. It will end officially at one minute after midnight tonight, Tuesday 8th of May. We may allow ourselves a brief period of rejoicing. We must now devote all our strength and resources to the completion of our task both at home and abroad. One veteran who certainly remembers his brief period of rejoicing is Ken Wilkinson. RAF fighter pilot. Now 96, he flew Spitfires. That day he was up in a Hurricane with his retail chains to the BBC. The news came on that the war was over so I did a great big barrel roll around the way and landed and went to the nearest boozer and had a few. Many of these veterans will be at the centre of this event as there is celebration. The same powerful emotions being evoked in France. You’s most powerful ally was represented by Secretary of State john Kerry. Washington also saluted her heroes with a huge fly past which symbolised the huge military might which to the balance 70 years ago. Within the past hour, all over Britain, some 200 beacons have been let. A chain linking Dover to the Antrim coast. The most northerly community of the British Isles involved too. Let us have another word with our political editor, Nick Robinson. What can we look forward to, if that is the right way to put it, in the next five years? It will look very much like the immediate past in that the main jobs at the top of government have been reappointed. The Tories will celebrate because they feel that they are liberated. They can do all those things in a majority government that the Lib Dems stop them from doing. Tories with all the memories will think that a small majority is not always a blessing. Asked john Major who had small groups of Tory rebels causing utter mayhem. He could split his own party. What was it that that the damage forjohn Major? Europe. As David Cameron going to worry about that tonight? No, because he went into the selection as a man who had never won an election. Tonight, as he sleeps here, he is able to say, I am the man who won the election that almost everybody thought could not be won. It’s been a memorable 24 hours, to say the least, since that exit poll stunned everyone when it was published last night. And David Cameron’s Conservatives look forward to five years in power, without having to rely on any coalition partners. Newsnight is on BBC Two with more interviews and analysis.

I’ve just been to see Her Majesty The Queen and I will now form a majority Conservative Government. Good evening. The election turned out to be a devastating day for the Liberal Democrats, all but wiped out here in the capital. And while nationally the Conservatives dominate, in London it’s Labour who stole the lead. Our Political Correspondent Karl Mercer now reports on how the drama unfolded. It wasn’t a good night to be a London Lib Dem. Everywhere you looked they were losing seats. Six in all in the capital. After 32 years, the voters of Southwark finally decided they’d had enough of Simon Hughes. I hope you think, for 32 years, I have served you well, thank you very much. Ed Davey, Paul Burstow and Vince Cable in south-west London, found voters there, just as unforgiving. I think he is an old buffoon. I think he is a nice chap I’m sure but I think he was a buffoon. I’m not surprised, in the run-up, the people I spoke, I felt the Conservatives were ahead, anyway. How do the Lib Dems, yourself and the Lib Dems pick yourself up, I mean across the board it has to be a bad night? Oh you have worked that one out, have you? It is a bad night, yeah, we have worked that out. Well, let’s reflect. We are a little shocked, as our figures were suggesting we were going to do a lot better. It does seem to me it was very much a late swing, which the polls hadn’t picked up. Infact, no-one had picked it up, Tom Brake is now the only Lib Dem MP left in London. We’ve got to back to our grassroots, rely on our local activists, build up from the bottom upwards and ensure that we start to regain some of the seats that we have lost. While Labour was losing seats all over the country, it was at least winning some in London, seven in total. A good result, but not quite the 12 they had aimed for but still possible lessons here for the national party. You know, we are not doing well in the country. We are doing better in London, and I think that’s in part because of the way in which the Labour Party campaigned in London. jayne Ellison is duly elected. The Tories held off chalence in places like Battersea, Harrow, Finchley, Hendon and Croydon Central where Gavin Barwell won the seat by 165 votes. My experience is that there are lots of people here in this town who are naturally Conservative in their values but they don’t vote for the Conservative Party. David Cameron has done a lot to bring some of those people into our column but there is more to do over the next five years. Outside London Ukip had been hoping for a surge in Essex but after a recount in Thurrock, the Conservatives held on. There is a large section of the public that does feel disenfranchised. The message that Ukip were giving, particularly talking about immigration was appealing to a lot of people. Across Evans and Kent the party saw its rise substantial. In the end, it was all blue apart from three seats. No yellow for the Lib Dems and in London a desperate night saw the party reduced to a one-man band. And you can get a full breakdown of every result including the constituencies out of London on the bbc election website. The details on yOUIâ SCI’ââI’I. The Mayor of London has an additionaljob as of today - MP for Uxbridge and Ruislip South. Boris johnson won the safe Conservative seat, as predicted, with a majority of more than 10,000. Our Political Editor, Tim Donovan, is in the constituency now. Yes, he is back in Parliament after several years. Of course he spent a lot of this campaign, campaigning in those south-west London Liberal Democrat seats but also trying to help Conservatives defend marginals. He had some success at that T our reporter Gareth Furby caught up with him whenever he could. I hereby declare that the said Borisjohnson is duly elected. Boris johnson wins his seat and his role in the Conservative victory may have been significant. It seemed every one wanted a selfie. But did that necessarily mean votes? Are you going to vote Conservative? Absolutely. Why do you want selfies? We love Borisjohnson. Which party will be be voting for. Ukip About half way through the campaign a strategy emerged. Using Boris and his image as a it be particularal we yovenlt Is Boris the weapon? I hope so. Why is he the secret weapon? He reaches the other parts of voters, the normal politician doesn’t. But some people were asking whether all this campaigning meant he had too much on his plate. In Uxbridge, his constituency, there was unhappiness when he missed a hustings. Right, Boris are you coming to this hustings tonight, old chap? Oh, yes. He should be here to give his views. I think it is disrespective. It is only Boris that hasn’t turned up. But But he took the seat and now attention may turn to something often mentioned during his campaign. You can then run for PM. Boris for Prime Minister. Prime Minister-to-be. But for now David Cameron is staying in Downing Street and Borisjohnson is a new map. Ministerial position is a possibility for a man who wore odd socks on a campaign when he visited a mosque. Th They are not, it seems a perfect match. Speaking today on the Uxbridge result, he said he had to focus first on his existing commitments I have to serve out as Mayor of London for another year. There is a huge amount to be done. We have to make sure Crossrail 2 is properly embedded there. Can be no going back on the river crossings and all the things we need to do in London and, as you know, whatever happens after that year will be a bonus. Many observers may think the mayor has had a good election campaign. And his political ascendcy may now continue. Tim, what next for him, as mayor and as an MP? Well, we are all clear now, aren’t we, about his leadership ambitions. He was quite open about them during the campaign. The question is to which is the best route? Some people think this is on the right track. He is returning to Parliament. He needs to, people say, show he can be a collegiate part of government. He needs to build up some parliamentary support and then maybe tilt for the leadership if and when it becomes available in two or three years’ when it becomes available in two or three years’ time T as to whether he can combine a job as an MP here with being Mayor of London for the last year, well this was one view. Boris is one of the few people I know who have that huge capacity to do twojobs well. As I have said and I have been a minister, I know you can both be a wonderful constituency MP, or at least try to be and I know he will be, and to have a very demanding executive job as well. Now some NOW SOTTIE people whether his chance may have been and gone, given, of course people were saying that David Cameron’s authority has been enhanced, not diminished and thus, so might, for instance, the authority of George Osborne, seen as one of the key rivals of the mayor. As to what happens over this next year, some people are raising concerns about whether the mayor will be able to fulfil or do what is required, achieved what Londoners expect of him this last year and the Chief Executive of the London Chamber of Commerce has raised some concerns today, saying, you know, now the mayor is living a double life, the lights at City Hall are already being switched off. London needs a full-time mayor, he says, and I think there will be a number of people watching to see whether, fulfilling housing, infrastructure and other responsibilities, suffer in anyway. OK, from Uxbridge, thank you very much indeed. That’s about it from us. I will leave you with the weekend weather outlook in London. Have a lovely weekend. Now the national forecast. Warmer weather on the way for many over the next few days but warmer doesn’t always mean sunny. Take tomorrow morning, for example. A pretty drab start to the weekend. Cloud and rain and drizzle but stick with it and skies will brighten tomorrow and for many there will be sunny spells in the afternoon and evening. This evening, still quite wet across northern England and southern Scotland, a gusty wind blowing further south, especially on the south coast and with the cloud and wind and rain, temperatures higherthan and wind and rain, temperatures higher than last night, the exception being north-west Scotland where clearer skies and lighter winds mean there could be a touch of frost. It also means that here there should be sparkling sunshine it start the weekend. A cracking day generally over the Highlands and Western Isles but drab over eastern Scotland, rain and drizzle in the Edinburgh area. Quickly skies brightening for Northern Ireland. Sunshine here. Sunshine in short Supply Sunshine here. Sunshine in short supply across England and Wales. Dull and damp supply across England and Wales. Dulland damp it Dull and damp it start across northern England. Some sharp showers in south-west and south-west England. Maybe a crack of lightning here. Those sharp showers will shimmy across southern areas during the course of the morning. The dull and damp weather will take a while it clear from north-east England. But overall, skies are frightening and for many sunny spells. We are just left with a few sharp showers in eastern areas come the afternoon. Temperatures will respond to the sunshine. Where it takes longest to brighten up, it will be coolest, chilly on some North Sea coasts. Even here, though, the showers tend to fade through the evening. For most it is a fine Saturday evening with some sunshine. Turning cool and signs of things changing once more in the far north-west. Rain approaching from an area of low pressure. A real scrap going on, on Sunday and Monday between this low and this high building into the south and potentially bringing some warm weather. Certainly for most of England and Wales, a dry day on Sunday, maybe drizzle around western coasts but there will be rain at times for western Scotland and Northern Ireland. As it brightens up across England and Wales, that warm air means temperaturesjumping into the high teens widely. 20 Celsius is possible. Maybe warmer still on Monday, but that fight continues between the warmer air in the south coming up from France, Spain and Portugal which could bring temperatures over 20 degrees in the south on Monday but it may get shunted out of the way on Tuesday as cooler air approaches. shunted out of the way on Tuesday as coolerairapproaches.

Veterans of World War II join the Queen for a service of remembrance marking the 70th anniversary of VE Day. Thousands gather in central London for a parade marking the end in 1945 of the war in Europe. Among those taking part, some of those who experienced six long years of war. I was the only girl in the village who volunteered - there were six boys and myself, and three didn’t come home and one came home badly injured and three of us survived unscathed.

The Labour peer Lord Mandelson savages Ed Miliband’s election strategy and says the party’s moved too far to the left.

Hundreds of World War II veterans took part in a parade through London today to mark the 70th anniversary of the Allied victory over Nazi Germany. Earlier, the Queen led a service of thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey, where the Archbishop of Canterbury said those who served had ensured ""victory over the greatest darkness of the 20th century"". Nicholas Witchell reports. A day of national thanksgiving for a victory. Receeding a little into history but undiminished in significance. Without this victory, there would have been no freedom. The commemoration was led within the ancient walls of Westminster Abbey by a monarch who remembers VE Day and knows only too well the scale of her generation’s sacrifice. The Queen placed her wreath at the Grave of the Unknown Warrior. 70 years ago she had appeared on VE Day on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with her father King George VI as the crowd celebrated victory in Europe. Today, in Westminster Abbey, the Queen listened as words from her father’s VE Day speech, giving thanks for Britain’s deliverance, were recalled. Speaking from our Empire’s oldest capital city, war battered... Daunted or dismayed. Speaking from London, I ask you to join with me in that act of thanksgiving. 70 years after the war in Europe ended, a single guardsmen sounded the Last Post. At the Abbey’s West Door, the Queen met some of the veterans, members of a generation bonded by memories of a time when the United Kingdom and its allies stood against tyranny. And then in the spring sunshine, the veterans marched to the acclamation of the crowds, through Parliament Square and up Whitehall, pausing to pay their respects at the Cenotaph and to the friends that were lost. In the skies above, two Hurricanes and a Spitfire from the Battle of Britain Memorial flight adding their tribute to a generation which is now growing old but which 70 years ago would not be beaten. Today’s events were the culmination of commemorations involving veterans from across the country. One of them is 89-year-old Barbara Weatherill from Selby in North Yorkshire, who was just 17 when she joined the army. Daniella Relph has her story. But For Barbara, today was always going to be something special. She was centre stage. Thank you, everybody. Wherever she went, the crowd showed their appreciation. All of those people lined the route just for us, I was close to tears. I was laughing and smiling away. In the war, Barbara was an Army driver. The reality of war was a shock. I was the only girl with six always and myself, and three did not come home and one came home badly injured, and three of us were unscathed. Quite a big price to pay for a small village. She was in Sunderland on VE Day, still working as a driver trying to get through the excitable crowds. I remember it vividly. I was the duty driver. In the afternoon, when everybody was out celebrating in Sunderland, I had to take a truckload of rations to a battery. It was absolute chaos. At Westminster Abbey today, It was absolute chaos. At WestminsterAbbey today, in Westminster Abbey today, in the service of thanksgiving, she was one of four veterans chosen to meet the Queen. It was a day of shared experiences. After the pomp of the Abbey, time for tea with the Prime Minister, and a chat with the Duchess of Cornwall. As memories fade, these days have added poignancy. There is a comradeship. You shake hands with people you have never met before and will never see again that there is a bond. The years are forgotten and it is a war time spirit. She was with her daughter, jane today and almost 90 she says it will be probably her last time at an event of this kind. You think of the millions who never came home and at the time, you are hoping all the sacrifice is worth it. I think the world is probably a better place, hopefully. I do not want it to be forgotten. For Barbara, there is a determination that her story will not be forgotten. Other news now and in the aftermath of the general election Lord Mandelson has said that Ed Miliband threw away Labour’s chance of returning to power by shifting it to the left. The peer, who was closely involved in Tony Blair’s election victories, also said Labour had lacked an economic plan. His comments came as senior figures in the party spoke of its future direction. Here’s our Deputy Political Editor, james Landale. In the numb aftermath of defeat, Labour is asking how one day it can win control of this building once again. Today a clutch of potential leaders from the centre-right gathered before the cameras with a simple pitch. Labour must appeal to the aspirational middle classes. A message once delivered by this man who was brutal in his analysis. The party had made a mistake in discarding New Labour which led to a defeat which it had not seen since the 1980s. We were sent out and told to waive our fists at the angry Tories. We had to wait for the public to tell us how much they mist us but they did not. One candidate admitted Labour had run to larger deficit before the crash and said the party needed to appeal to wealth creators. We, have a message that says somebody is too rich or too poor to be part of our party. It brings a big tent of people of different backgrounds and economic circumstances. To-macro different generations with a similar message and they were not alone. We failed to appeal to aspirational communities but we also lost the support of traditional Labour communities who did not feel the Labour Party were speaking to their values. The 1 contender who has said she wants to be leader has said the party should be more positive and less like a man who moans but is ignored. We did not build a broad enough coalition of voters in different parts of the country and did not set out a positive alternative for the future. It is not enough to critique what is going on under the government but to set out something people can believe in. Even those who sat in the last cabinet were testing the water. We have to learn the lessons of what was a bad defeat for us. Whether thatis was a bad defeat for us. Whether that is in the market towns of Middle England orients Scottish cities and industrial heartlands. We have to win those votes back and champion aspirations and fairness for the future. This is the start of a debate that Labour is going to have about the future in its headquarters and around the country. Appealing to the middle classes is one point of view. Others believe the party has to do something fundamentally different if it is to appeal to those who backed the SNP in Scotland and you get in England. Labour MPs will gather here tomorrow and party chiefs will meet later in the week. The first task is to decide whether to elect a new leader quickly or wait. Meanwhile the Liberal Democrats have announced that they will have a new leader before Parliament breaks up for summer. After their Leader Nick Clegg announced his resignation on Friday. The party only retained eight seats, but has since had an unexpected boost of 5,000 new members. Nominations open on Wednesday. David Cameron continues to reshape his cabinet. Today Michael Gove was confirmed as the new justice Secretary, replacing Chris Grayling, who becomes leader of the House of Commons. More announcements are expected tomorrow and as Ben Wright explains the Prime Minister will be setting out on some difficult political terrain. Absorbing the stories of veterans after today’s service, David Cameron was back on prime ministerial duties this weekend, assembling his new team and handing out the top jobs. It is a Conservative government in charge, taking decisions on issues that will affect us all. George Osborne remains in charge of the money. An emergency budget is likely injune with spending cuts spelt out in the autumn. The Education Secretary’s loyalty has been rewarded, reappointed to herjob. She spelt out the priorities. I think what people voted for on Thursday was a continuation of things like the economic reform, making sure we balance the books, but also the delivery of key manifesto commitments, things like a British Bill of rights and an EU referendum. That will dominate the next two years. The Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond will have his work cut out. He along with George Osborne will lead the renegotiation with Europe and the task is huge. To convince European leaders to sign of concessions that will be put to a referendum by 2017. In the 1990sjohn Major’s government was torn apart. Senior Conservatives said David Cameron could avoid the same fate. We will not repeat that because we have done it before and know what it feels like. People have got the option of talking than ever before and if they don’t like the outcome they can campaign against it. Michael Gove has now gone to justice and will spearhead the scrapping of the Human Rights Act so British courtjudgements cannot be overruled in Europe. Yesterday Nicola Sturgeon showed off her 56 SNP MPs heading to Westminster. David Cameron has promised Scotland’s new powers but today, the leader promised a fight. We will argue for priority devolution of powers over business taxes, employment, minimum wage and welfare. This is what we need to grow our economy fast and get people into work. MPs are back here from tomorrow and Tories will be buzzing. A majority of 12 is small but more than any of them could have imagined. After five years sharing power with the Lib Dems, David Cameron is free to create policy once and give jobs to whom he once. -- policies. Acting Downing, Samantha Cameron is ensuring the right to but on Europe in particular, the Prime Minister’s party expects him to deliver. -- backin party expects him to deliver. -- back in Downing Street. It’s being reported that the man recently arrested after a woman’s parachute failed to open during a sky dive in Wiltshire is her husband. Victoria Cilliers, seen here with her husband, suffered multiple injuries when both her main and reserve parachutes malfunctioned during a solojump on Salisbury Plain. It’s now being reported that her husband Emile, who is an instructor, was arrested after police were alerted to the possibility her parachute could have been sabotaged. The German Chancellor Angela Merkel has attended a wreath-laying ceremony in Moscow to commemorate the Russians killed during World War Two. Mrs Merkel and other Western leaders did not attend yesterday’s military parade in Red Square because of tensions with Russia over the situation in Ukraine. President Putin says that a Ukraine peace deal is progressing, despite problems. Cuban President Raul Castro has been granted an audience at the Vatican with Pope Francis. Afterwards, he said he’d thanked the Pope for helping broker Cuba’s rapprochement with the US. Mr Castro also said if the Pope continued in this vein, he would ""resume praying and turn to the Church again."" Pope Francis is expected to visit Cuba on his way to America in September. Five people have been shot dead in a village close to the Swiss city of Zurich. Police found bodies lying inside and outside a house and say the gunman, who also died, knew some of his victims. Officers say they’re treating the deaths as a family dispute and say it’s not terror-related. With all the sport, here’s Karthi at the BBC Sport Centre. Good evening. Queen’s Park Rangers have become the second team to be relegated from the Premier League this season after they were thrashed 6-0 by Manchester City. The victory guarantees City’s place in the Champions League next season. While the Premier League Champions Chelsea were held to a draw by Liverpool in their first home match since winning the title. Patrick Gearey reports. The faces and the QPR ends told of dread and not defiance. Only three winds from three would save them from relegation, a fate they seemed resigned to when confronted by Manchester City. The Argentinian’s 23rd league goal followed. Manchester City. The Argentinian’s 23rd league goalfollowed. This 23rd league goal followed. This was a slow demise with QPR powerless as a goal was placing them further beyond hope. How Rangers would have wished they could use this trick. Minutes into the second half, -- another goal. It will get worse. A foul allowed the torture to continue from the spot. Hat-trick complete, he allowed others to shine, setting UP he allowed others to shine, setting up james he allowed others to shine, setting upjames Milner’s fit. A superb move for the six goal. QPR spent big to get to the Premier League. The only return on that investment is a return to the championship. How different things were back in West London. Chelsea applauded on by Liverpool. The uncomfortable afternoon got worse thanks to a goal from john Terry, the Chelsea captain, and is now the highest scoring Premier League captain in history. How awful that must’ve been for Steven Gerrard who was mocked from the stands, but he was a response. It was not enough to give his side a realistic chance. Chelsea were the side that Steven Gerrard said once turned his head. He has at least one their respect. -- won. Scottish Champions, Celtic were also given a guard of honour today when they faced the side in second place in the Premiership, Aberdeen. A goal from Celtic captain, Scott Brown gave them a 1-nil win, and extends their lead at the top of the table to 14 points. It’s Celtic’s fourth win out of four over Aberdeen this season. A stunning goal from jermaine Beckford has sealed Preston’s place in the League One play off finals after a 3-0 win in the second leg of their semi-final against Chesterfield. Beckford scored from around the half way line to give Preston their third goal on the day. They were 4-0 aggregate winners. But during a post match pitch invasion the Chesterfield captain, Ian Evatt said he was punched and kicked by fans and has given a statement to the police. Formula One and the Mercedes driver, Nico Rosberg has won the Spanish Grand Prix, his first victory of the 2015 season. Rosberg beat his team-mate Lewis Hamilton to the chequered flag by over 17 seconds. The German is now 20 points Behind Hamilton in the Championship standings. Sebastian Vettel finished in third place today. There will be a thrilling end to rugby union’s regular season with the tussle for the final two Premiership play off places going down to the final weekend after Exeter Chiefs beat Saracens today by 24 points to 20. Exeter, who are aiming to qualify for the play offs for the first time in their history, moved above Saracens in to fourth place with a win that included two tries from Thomas Waldrom. And Olympic Silver medallist William Fox-Pitt has won the Badminton Horse Trials title for the second time after a clear showjumping round on his horse, Chilli Morning.

Now on BBC1 its time for the news where you are. Goodbye. Good evening, I’m Asad Ahmad. Scotland Yard says a 16 year-old boy was among the people arrested in Whitehall last night - during a spontaneous 'anti-austerity’ protest. Four police officers were among those injured and graffiti was daubed on a war memorial. But today some protestors were angry that their message had been overshadowed by the violent scenes. Katharine Carpenter reports. Violent clashes between demonstrators and police and yesterday’s protest. One officer was taken to hospital but others claim the police response was heavy-handed. It was frustrating. People were out here and trying to express themselves in a simple and beautiful way. They please say they put in place the most appropriate operation to allow it to respond to a small minority intent on causing disorder but the vast majority of the crowd was peaceful. Hundreds reacting to the election results and calling for an end to austerity and questioning the Constitution. Themes revisited at another event today. We have very big changes and people are frightened. I don’t think they should be but they have not been given any competent story on how we can go forward as a country and that is what is happening. While the debate over the future has continued, the police have launched an investigation into the vandalism at this war memorial. The words were removed in time for the VE Day event. Now they are just removing the final traitors and say there should not be any permanent damage. Scotland Yard says it is examining CCTV and looking for witnesses to try and identify those responsible. More strikes have been announced by refuse collectors in Barking and Dagenham - over cuts to overtime payments and the safety of vehicles. The current eight day walk out ended this weekend with further action scheduled for Wednesday. Here’s Sarah Harris. The bins here in Barking are already overflowing and it could be weeks more before they are collected. The dispute between the East London council and refuse lorry drivers is far from over and residents are getting worried. There are a lot of bins and waste from the kitchen and it is smelly, it is bad. I have a three-year-old son upstairs and he is in nappies. That bin is a quarter full of nappies. Obviously it is unhygienic. The dispute started when the council cut the time they pay drivers to safety check their vehicles from 30 to 15 minutes. Two unions have settled with managers but the GMB say their strike goes on. We don’t believe those vehicle checks can be carried out adequately in 15 minutes according to the guidelines set by Vosa. Therefore we can have a situation where vehicles could go on the public road that are dangerous. The concern is about drivers and more importantly the public. The new policy means cutting the drivers’ pay packets by £1000 a year but leaders say the changes are in line with neighbouring boroughs. There is no other east London borough that pays us half an hour outside of a normal working week so we would not endanger anybody. Health and safety is not the issue because even if we cut from half an hour to 15 minutes which we are offering, we would allow staff to carry into their normal 35 hour week five or ten minute completion if they thought it took that long. While the dispute goes on, the rubbish builds. As David Cameron continues to form his government - one former cabinet member has said that housing will be a key priority for the Tories in London. Some experts feel the fact Labour gained seven seats in London could be due to the capital’s housing problem The perception that the housing crisis has got worse is much greater now and we know there are more people renting every year, renting as a proportion of the total is going up. I think it is a key priority for the new Tory government to be delivering more housing. We believe it is possible to do that, there are many brown field sites in London which we can use. We can mitigate the problems people have with getting affordable housing. A look at the weather now, with Sara. Good evening. It turned out to be a lovely day across London with temperatures in the low 20s. Potentially warmer tomorrow, we are talking about sunny spells. A chance of cloud pushing through in the morning but once the sun gets to work on that, we will get holes punched through with sunny spells. Some cloud pushing through from the north and west but it will not affect things too much with a high of 23 or 24. Cooler for Tuesday with a risk of showers and dry and settled on Wednesday with rain on Thursday. Commiserations to QPR who are relegated from the Premier League after their defeat by Manchester City. That’s it for now. I’ll be back after the Bafta Awards on BBC One. ",,

While the dispute goes on, the rubbish builds. As David Cameron continues to form his government - one former cabinet member has said that housing will be a key priority for the Tories in London. Some experts feel the fact Labour gained seven seats in London could be due to the capital’s housing problem The perception that the housing crisis has got worse is much greater now and we know there are more people renting every year, renting as a proportion of the total is going up. I think it is a key priority for the new Tory government to be delivering more housing. We believe it is possible to do that, there are many brown field sites in London which we can use. We can mitigate the problems people have with getting affordable housing. A look at the weather now, with Sara. Good evening. It turned out to be a lovely day across London with temperatures in the low 20s. Potentially warmer tomorrow, we are talking about sunny spells. A chance of cloud pushing through in the morning but once the sun gets to work on that, we will get holes punched through with sunny spells. Some cloud pushing through from the north and west but it will not affect things too much with a high of 23 or 24. Cooler for Tuesday with a risk of showers and dry and settled on Wednesday with rain on Thursday. Commiserations to QPR who are relegated from the Premier League after their defeat by Manchester City. That’s it for now. I’ll be back after the Bafta Awards on BBC One. That’s at 10.25. Until then, have a very good evening. Good evening. There are still some decent spells of late sunshine to enjoy across the South East of England over the next hour. Clear skies here as you can see but further north and west a different story. A weather front brings cloud and rain into Northern Ireland and Scotland. Quite blustery as well. This and rain creeps further south through the rest of the evening and overnight. Heavy at times for Dumfries and Galloway. By the end of the night, it will fall lighter. Clear and dry to the south of that. Low cloud in the south-west and clearer fresher conditions behind that. In Monday, the rain pushes south. It Bills away so by the afternoon, reallyjust a band of cloud. Temperatures in the mid teens. Scattered showers across Northern Ireland and Scotland, even the rumble of thunder. 22 or 23 across the South East. Monday night, low-pressure so tight isobars into Tuesday. Another blustery day and many places could catch a shower. They ease away into the afternoon, and improving weather story. Some rain continuing in the North through the day. He is coming, you know. The Raven... is coming. Oh, God, I really wish I’d prepared a speech. It’s the biggest night of the year for the brightest stars of the small screen. It’s such a good night, this.

CHEERING Oh, God, I really wish I’d prepared a speech. Good luck, everyone. I wish everyone could win. Come on, let’s go to the BAFTAs! join Graham Norton for... MUSIC: Countryfile Theme ADAM HENSON: The British countryside. A patchwork landscape of farmland, glowing fields of gold, perfectly ploughed earth and acre upon acre of grazing livestock. Come by. Tonight’s programme is a celebration of farming. Of the men and women who work all year round - tirelessly - to put food on our plates. The custodians of our landscape - ourfarming heroes. Matt, Ellie, Anita, Tom and I will be championing some of our favourite farming heroes from history. From an eccentric inventor... Looking at the collection, it was this tractor here, wasn’t it, at the front, that was the real game changer? Yes, it was, Matt. The little grey Fergie, the TE20, it just revolutionised farming. ..to a pioneering doctor... jenner is the man who really changed the face of medicine. And if you take 100 people on the street today - without vaccination, 30 of them would not be there. And from animal lovers... They succeeded in changing the attitude of the British public. ..to an inspirational leader. He did many miles by train and pony and cart, persuading farmers to join this national union. And my favourite - a true farmer, of course. He was at the cutting edge. He put food on the table for everybody. But you’ve been telling us about modern-day farming heroes, too. And tonight we’ll be revealing the winner of Countryfile’s first Farming Heroes Award. From more than 800 nominations we received, we whittled it down to three very worthy finalists. And tonight’s the night we reveal the winner at the BBC’s Food and Farming Awards in Bristol. As part of this year’s Food and Farming Awards, Countryfile have launched its own Farming Heroes Award, and the response to our callout for your farming heroes was fantastic. And that got us thinking - who are the agricultural heroes of history, people who have changed the way I and many other farmers work and, in some cases, changed the world? We’re kicking off this celebration of farming with Matt, who’s never more at home than when he’s behind the wheel of a tractor. He’s championing an extraordinary man with a very clever invention. MATT: Whether it’s upland, lowland, arable or dairy, at the heart of every farm is the tractor. Today, there are more than 200 tractor manufacturers. But few, if any, have had such an impact as my farming hero. Harry Ferguson. Often described as a genius, Ferguson was a remarkable man whose talents knew no bounds. Whether he was designing racing cars, being the first Briton to build and fly his own airplane, or revolutionising farming with his Ferguson System, Harry’s brilliance lay in simple, efficient designs that worked, and stood the test of time. I’ve come to the Drinkwaters’ family farm in the Cotswolds to meet two brothers who are self-confessed Fergie fanatics. And I’m going to find one of them in here. Andy, are you there? Ah, tinkering away. How are you? Nice to see you. Pleased to meet you, Matt. This is some place. Every bit of available space there’s either a tractor or an implement parked in it. When did this, and why, did this all start? Well, we were brought up on these Ferguson tractors and tractors like this, and that’s what Dad had when we were kids. We’ve just grown up with them. And you’ve got your brother to blame for part of this collection as well. What is he passionate about? Well, ",,

Thousands gather in central London for a parade marking the end - in 1945 - of the war in Europe. Among those taking part- some of those who experienced six long years of conflict. I was the only girl in the village who volunteered - there were six boys and myself, and three didn’t come home and one came home badly injured - and three of us survived unscathed. We’ll look back at one of the last major gatherings of the wartime generation. Also on tonight’s programme - David Cameron says he has a ""lot on his plate"" after the Conservatives’ election victory - as he makes new Cabinet appointments. The soul-searching for Labour - Lord Mandelson says Ed Miliband’s approach ignored a vast swathe of the population. COMMENTATORZ COMMENTATOR: Magnificent moment! Andy Murray wins the Madrid Open after beating Rafael Nadal. Good evening- commemorations for the 70th anniversary of Victory in Europe - at the end of the Second World War- have culminated with a parade in London and a service of thanksgiving. The Queen led the congregation at Westminster Abbey, where the Archbishop of Canterbury spoke of victory ""over the greatest darkness of the 20th Century"". Hundreds of surviving veterans were involved in the parade - as Nicholas Witchell reports, on a day of remembrance. A day of national thanksgiving for a victory. Receding a little into history now but undiminished in significance. For without this victory there would have been no freedom. The commemoration was led within the ancient walls of Westminster Abbey by a monarch who remembers VE Day and who knows only too well the scale of her generation’s sacrifice. The Queen placed her wreath at the Grave of The Unknown Warrior. 70 years ago she appeared on VE Day on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with her father, King George VI, as the crowd celebrated Victory in Europe. Today in Westminster Abbey the Queen listened, as words from her father’s VE Day speech giving thanks for Britain’s deliverance, were recalled. Speaking from our Empire’s oldest capital city, war battered but... ..Never for one moment daunted or dismayed. Speaking from London, I ask you to join with me in that act of thanksgiving. LAST POST PLAYS 70 years after the war in Europe ended, a single guardsman sounded The Last Post. At the Abbey’s West Door the Queen met some of the veterans, members of a generation bonded by memories of a time when the United Kingdom and its allies stood against tyranny. And then in the spring sunshine the veterans marched to the acclamation of the crowds through Parliament Square and up Whitehall, pausing to pay their respects at the Cenotaph to those many friends who were lost. In the skies above, two Hurricanes and a Spitfire from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight adding their tribute to an indefatigable generation which has now grown old, but which 70 years ago would not be beaten. Nicholas Witchell, BBC News. Veterans across the country took park in the 70th anniversary commemorations. One who travelled to London was 89-year-old Barbara Weatherill from Selby in North Yorkshire. She was 17 when she joined the war effort. Our correspondent Daniela Relph has her story. For Barbara Weatherill today was always going to be something special. She was centre stage. Thank you, everybody. Wherever she went the crowds showed their appreciation. All those people came out and lined the route just for us. I was very close to tears, although I was laughing and smiling and waving. During the war Barbara was an Army driver. She wanted adventure, but the reality of war was a shock. I was the only girl in the village who volunteered. There were six boys and myself, and three didn’t come home and one came home badly injured and three of us survived unscathed. It was quite a big price to pay for a small Dales village at that time. She was in Sunderland on VE Day, still working as a driver, trying to get through the excitable crowds. In the afternoon when everybody was out celebrating in Sunderland I had to take a truckload of rations through Sunderland to another battery, and it was absolute chaos. At Westminster Abbey today during the service of Thanksgiving, Barbara was one of four veterans chosen to meet the Queen. She shared today with her daughterjane. At almost 90 she says this will probably be her last time at an event of this kind. When you think of the millions who never came home and then at the time hoping that all sacrifice was worth it. I think the world is probably a better place, hopefully. I don’t want it to be forgotten. Daniela Relph, BBC News, Westminster Abbey. David Cameron has said he has a ""lot on his plate"" after the Conservatives’ general election victory. Today he continued to shape his Cabinet- confirming that Michael Gove will be the new justice Secretary - replacing Chris Grayling, who becomes Leader of the House of Commons. Iain Duncan-Smith is to remain as Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. Our political correspondent Ben Wright reports. Absorbing the stories of veterans after today’s service - David Cameron was back on prime ministerial duties this weekend, assembling his new team, handing out the top jobs. It’s a Conservative government now in charge, taking decisions on issues that will affect us all. George Osborne remains in charge of the money. An emergency budget is likely injune with new spending cuts spelt out in the autumn. Iain Duncan-Smith will continue to run the Department for Work and Pensions. And one of hisjobs will be to cut £12 billion from the benefits bill. The Education Secretary’s loyalty has been rewarded reappointed to her job. She spelt out the Government’s priorities. Well, I think people, what they wanted, what they voted for on Thursday, was very much a continuation of things like our economic reforms, making sure that we balance the books, but also the delivery of some key manifesto commitments. Things obviously like a British Bill of Rights and an EU referendum. And that will dominate the next two years. The Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond will have his work cut out. He along with George Osborne will lead the UK’s renegotiation with Europe and the task is huge to convince European leaders to sign off concessions that will be put to a referendum by 2017. In the 1990s, john Major’s government was torn apart over Europe but today senior Conservatives said David Cameron could avoid the same fate. I don’t think we’ll repeat the Major days, for three reasons. One, we’ve done before and we know what it feels like. Two, people have got the option of talking to him more than before. And three, if they don’t like the outcome they can actually campaign against it in a referendum. Once a radical Education Secretary Michael Gove has now gone tojustice and will spearhead the scrapping of the Human Rights Act so British courtjudgements can be overruled in Europe. courtjudgements cannot be overruled in Europe. Yesterday, Nicola Sturgeon showed off the 56 SNP MPs heading to Westminster. David Cameron has promised Scotland new powers, but today the SNP leader promised a fight. What we will argue for is priority devolution of powers over business taxes, employment, the minimum wage and welfare because these are the levers we need to grow our economy faster, to get people into work, paying taxes and lifting people out of poverty. MPs are back here from tomorrow and Tories will be buzzing. A majority of 12 is small but more than any of them could have imagined. After five years sharing power with the Liberal Democrats, David Cameron is free to pursue the policies he wants and give jobs to who he wants. At the start of this new parliament the Prime Minister will enjoy his power. Back in Downing Street, Samantha Cameron seems to be enjoying the ride too. But on Europe in particular the Prime Minister’s party now expects him to deliver. Ben Wright, BBC News, Westminster. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats have announced that they will have a new leader before Parliament breaks up for summer - after Nick Clegg announced his resignation on Friday. The party only retained eight seats, but has since had an unexpected boost of 5,000 new members. Nominations open on Wednesday. One of the main architects of Labour’s victories under Tony Blair has attacked the approach taken by Ed Miliband, saying the party now faces a challenge similar in scale to that of the 1980s. His comments came as the Shadow Health Minister- Liz Kendall- became the first to declare she would run for the leadership. Here’s our deputy political editor james Landale. In the numb aftermath of defeat Labour is beginning to ask how one day it could win control of this building once again. Today, a clutch of potential leaders from the party’s centre-right gathered before the cameras with a simple pitch: Labour must once again appeal to the aspirational middle classes. A message once delivered by this man who was brutal in his analysis. The party had made a terrible mistake in discarding New Labour, leading to a defeat, the like of which it hadn’t seen since the 1980s. We were sort of sent out and told to waive our fists and told to wave our fists angrily at the nasty Tories and wait for the public to realise how much they had missed us. Well, they weren’t missing us and they didn’t miss us. One potential leadership candidate admitted Labour had run too large a deficit before the crash and said the party had to appeal to wealth creators. We can’t have a message that says anybody is too rich or too poor to be part of our party. What the Labour Party does well is build a big tent of people of different backgrounds, creeds, races, religions and economic circumstances. Two different generations with a similar message. And they weren’t alone. We failed to appeal to aspirational communities across the country. But we also lost the support of traditional Labour communities, who did not feel that the Labour Party was speaking to their values. The one contender who has openly declared she wants to be leader said the party had to be more positive and less like a man in a pub who moans but is ignored. We didn’t build a broad enough coalition of voters in different parts of the country and we didn’t set out a positive enough alternative for the future. It’s not enough to just critique what is going under this government, you’ve got to set out something people can believe in. And even those who sat in the last Labour Cabinets were out testing the water. We’ve got to make sure we learned the lessons from what is a really bad defeat for us, whether we’ve lost votes in market towns in middle England, or whether that is in our Scottish cities and industrial heartlands. We’ve got to win those votes back and be championing both aspiration and fairness for the future. This isjust the start of a long debate that Labour is going to have about its future here at its headquarters and around the country. And appealing to the aspirational middle classes is just one point of view. Others on the left think the party has to do something fundamentally different if it is to appeal to those who backed the SNP in Scotland and Ukip in the North of England. Labour MPs will gather here tomorrow, but party chiefs will meet later in the week. Their first task, to decide to elect a new leader quickly, or wait until the autumn. james Landale is live at Westminster. How much do we know about the Labour leadership contest? Not a lot, the timing is still to be decided. What we know is one of the potential contenders has dropped out, the MP for Barnsley Central, Dan jarvis, out, the MP for Barnsley Central, Danjarvis, urged by colleagues to stand, they thought he was the man who would help the party to reconnect with the public, a former major in the Parachute Regiment who served with distinction in Afghanistan and Iraq and is highly regarded and full of ideas for Labour’s future but he’s announced he will not be standing and said it is not the right time for his family. That will disappoint some in Labour, just as it might please some in Conservative ranks who thought he could pose a threat to the Conservatives. As for the conservative ranks, those MPs are meeting at Westminster tomorrow. They will be addressed by the Prime Minister, setting the tone for what I think will be a crucial relationship over the next five years in this parliament when the government has such a small majority and those MPs could potentially cause the Prime Minister so much trouble. As for the Prime Minister, tomorrow he will complete his Cabinet reshuffle. Tomorrow I think we will see change, some younger faces in the Cabinet, more female faces in the Cabinet taking jobs that used to belong, some of them to the Liberal Democrats, they will now belong to the Conservatives. james Lyne Dale, thank you. On the subject of David Cameron he’s already made calls to European leaders about membership of the European Union. Katja Hall is in Brussels. How will this process work? It’s early days. I’m told that the talks he’s had with EU leaders are rather general, saying it is a subject that must be talked about soon. George Osborne comes to Brussels on Tuesday for a meeting of EU finance ministers and has been named the Prime Minister’s chief negotiator on Europe so you can expect him to be mobbed by EU colleagues, in a friendly way, of course but he will want to know what concrete requests the UK has. David Cameron has been vague until now. He will have to work fast to achieve significant EU change and hold a referendum by 2017. He may come under pressure to work even faster at home and abroad. EU powers Germany and France have their own elections in 2017 and their governments worry about the rising popularity of Eurosceptic parties like France’s National Front. They fear if Britain leaves the EU or gets its own dealjust as their populations go to the poll that could give more power to the Eurosceptics. They will want the British question to be settled sooner rather than later. Thank you forjoining us. It’s being reported that a man recently arrested after a woman’s parachute failed to open during a sky dive in Wiltshire - is her husband. Victoria Cilliers, seen here with her husband Emile, suffered multiple injuries when both her main and reserve parachutes malfunctioned during a solojump on Salisbury Plain. It’s now emerged that her husband, who is an instructor, was questioned by police after they were alerted to the possibility that the parachutes were sabotaged. With all the sport- here’s Karthi Gnanasegaram at the BBC Sport Centre. Good evening. Andy Murray is the Madrid Masters Champion after beating Rafael Nadal on Clay for the first time. It’s Murray’s second successive clay court title - he won a tournament on the surface for the first time just six days ago. Patrick Gearey reports. Rafael Nadal’s Kingdom is built on clay, so on his home surface in his home country his authority is absolute. Six times Andy Murray played him on clay, six times he’s lost, and yet the first three games here were all Murray’s. He’d only won his first title on this surface on Monday yet here was the upstart challenging the king, even daring to beat him. First set remarkably Murray’s. The world and the three played on Spanish clay as a teenager, training in Barcelona but never has shown such mastery of the surface, judging his shots Beverly. From whichever angle you look at it Murray was the aggressor, taking the game to the Spaniard wherever possible, breaking twice in the second set. This doesn’t happen to Nadal, who is on the tournament four times, but were swept away in straight sets. Since his wedding last month Murray’s form has surged. Traditionally he struggled on clay, so what has changed? In his own words, marriage works. Patrick Geary, BBC News. It’s time to pop out of the room if you’re waiting to watch Match of the Day 2 or Sportscene which follow us soon on BBC 1. The Premier League’s top and bottom teams were in action today but Queen’s Park Rangers only have two games left in the top flight after they were relegated to the Championship with a 6-0 thrashing from Manchester City. While Champions Chelsea drew 1-1 with Liverpool in their first home game since winning the title. Like Chelsea, Scottish champions, Celtic were given a guard of honour today when they faced the side in second place in the Premiership, Aberdeen. The Celtic captain, Scott Brown scored the only goal of the game as they extended their lead at the top of the table to 14 points. A stunning goal from jermaine Beckford sealed Preston’s place in the League One play-off final after a 3-0 win in the second leg of their semi-final against Chesterfield. Beckford scored from around the half-way line to give Preston their third goal on the day, his second. They were 4-0 aggregate winners. But police are investigating claims that the Chesterfield captain, Ian Evatt was ""punched and kicked"" during a post match pitch invasion. Formula One and the Mercedes driver, Nico Rosberg has won the Spanish Grand Prix, his first victory of the season. Rosberg beat his team-mate Lewis Hamilton to the chequered flag by 17 seconds. The German is now 20 points behind Hamilton in the Championship standings. While Sebastian Vettel finished in third place today. The tussle for the final two play-off places will go down to the last weekend of the regular rugby union Premiership season after Exeter Chiefs beat Saracens today by 24 points to 20. Exeter, who are aiming to qualify for the play-offs for the first time in their history, moved above Saracens in to fourth place with a win that included two tries from Thomas Waldrom. And that’s all from the BBC Sport Centre. It’s been a key evening in the British show business calendar with the after television awards taking place in London. -- Bafta.

Scotland Yard says a 16 year-old boy was among the people arrested in Whitehall last night - during an anti-austerity protest. Four police officers were among those injured and graffiti was daubed on a war memorial. But today some protestors are angry that their message has been overshadowed by the violent scenes. Katharine Carpenter reports. Violent clashes between demonstrators and police and yesterday’s protest. One officer was taken to hospital but others claim the police response was heavy- handed. It was frustrating. People were out here and trying to express themselves in a simple way. The police say they put in place the most appropriate operation to allow it to respond to a small minority intent on causing disorder but the vast majority of the crowd was peaceful. Hundreds reacting to the election results and calling for an end to austerity and questioning the Constitution. Themes revisited at another event today. We have very big changes and people are frightened. I don’t think they should be but they have not been given any competent story on how we can go forward as a country and that is what is happening. While the debate over the future has continued, the police have launched an investigation into the vandalism at this war memorial. The words were removed in time for the VE Day event. Now they are just removing the final traces and say there should not be any permanent damage. Scotland Yard says it is examining CCTV and looking for witnesses to try and identify those responsible. More strikes have been announced by refuse collectors in Barking and Dagenham - over cuts to overtime payments and concerns about the safety of vehicles. The current eight-day walk out ended this weekend - with further action scheduled for Wednesday. Here’s Sarah Harris.

The bins here in Barking are already overflowing and it could be weeks more before they are collected. The dispute between the East London Council and refuse lorry drivers is far from over and residents are getting worried. There are a lot of bins and waste from the kitchen and it is smelly, it is bad. I have a three-year-old son upstairs and he is in nappies. That bin is a quarter full of nappies. Obviously it is unhygienic. The dispute started when the council cut the time they pay drivers to safety-check their vehicles from 30 to I5 minutes. Two unions have settled with managers but the GMB say their strike goes on. We don’t believe those vehicle checks can be carried out adequately in I5 minutes according to the guidelines set by Vosa. That is now the freight transport Association. Therefore we can have a situation where vehicles could go on the public road that are dangerous. The concern is about drivers and more importantly the public. The new policy means cutting the drivers’ pay packets by EIOOO a year but leaders say the changes are in line with neighbouring boroughs. There is no other east London borough that pays us half an hour outside of a normal working week so we would not endanger anybody. Health and safety is not the issue because even if we cut from half an hour to I5 minutes which we are offering, we would allow staff to carry into their normal 35-hour week a five or ten-minute completion if they thought it took that long. While the dispute goes on, the rubbish builds. A look at the weather now, with Sara. It turned out to be a warm and pleasant afternoon across London and tomorrow potentially warmer still, again talking about sunny spells. We have some cloud pushing in through the morning, but generally the sunshine punches holes in the cloud. We have a weak weather front trying to push more cloud towards us, but before that highs of 23 if not 24 Celsius. Generally settled for the ",,

Strong figures on the economy - the biggest real-terms rise in pay since the recession and unemployment is down again. Average earnings were up 2.2% - the average weekly wages is now ÂlI89 and 35,000 fewer people are out of work. We’ll be looking at those figures, and what they mean for you, with our economics correspondent. Also this lunchtime: The Royal Navy takes action - around 450 migrants are rescued in the Mediterranean - many of them women and children.

Later on BBC London: The gangs using chemicals to blow up cash machines and steal millions of pounds in the capital. Plus it’s a lovely sunny day but will it last? Your local and national forecast is coming up. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. There was good news on the economy today - average pay rose by 2.2% in the first three months of the year. That’s the biggest pay rise, in real terms, for five years - when the squeeze on living standards began. New figures also showed that there was a fall of 35,000 in the number of unemployed people. But there was caution, too, as the Bank of England said it was lowering its prediction for growth in the UK economy. Our economics correspondent Andy Verity’s been looking at why pay is finally rising. In Hounslow near Heathrow airport, there are more of these signs than that have been for years. With unemployment lower than it has been since the crisis began, it is getting harder for employers to recruit staff, whether they are British born and bred or immigrants. Forjob-seekers like Neil who has been out of work for two years, it is good news. I have been sending my CV out and I have been getting calls back. This is our reception staff. Daniel runs a recruitment agency which finds staff for Ho tells. He says if they want to find staff, companies will have to pay more. At the higher end of the hospitality, it has gone up 20% to retain those good staff. In the first three months of this year, average earnings went up by 2.2%. That is the biggest pay rise we have had since june 2011, up by £12 to EA60 a week on average. Part of the reason why pay is because unemployment is down to 5.5%. Today, the Bank of England governor said wages had been held down by a plentiful supply of Labour by immigrants and people working into retirement, but that is changing. In recent years, Labour Supply changing. In recent years, Labour supply has expanded significantly owing to a greater participation by older workers, a willingness to work longer hours and strong population growth, partly driven by higher net migration. Strong growth in Labour supply is unlikely to be sustained. High Street Taylor like this woman would have to boost her prices. Everybody has to check what they really need, food, clothes for children, then they will come and get something extra. Businesses like hers now face a slowing economy. While pay rises are higher, they still barely half thought we were used to before the crisis began. The economy not yet completely mended. And Andy is here with me now. Encouraging figures, but there is a but. Yes, it looks like on alloy and good news, inflation low, wages going up. But what is keeping inflation down, you have to remember, temporary factors. The biggest single factor according to Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, is oil prices. Although they have bounced, they are lower than they were a year ago. The comparison with last year includes the drop in the oil price that means that factor will wash out the calculations towards the end of this year. Then you have domestic pressures which will be the main thing pushing inflation up. Potentially, this tight Labour market we have got, where an employment is low and people will say, you have got to have me and we cannot find anyone else, that height market will push wages up, heating is, quite matter clear. Then we will have other factors such as sterling being stronger which has held inflation down will stop unless sterling keeps appreciating as it has, you cannot expect that to be keeping import prices down forever. The other aspect is the economy is slowing down. We only had modest growth in the first quarter. The bank has cut its forecast for the past year. We are not going like the clappers any more even though it seems like things are getting better. Thank you. The Royal Navy says it’s rescued more than 400 migrants from the Mediterranean, who were trying to reach Europe on 30-foot long inflatable dinghies. It comes on the morning that the European Commission proposed to take in 20,000 refugees over the next two years, and distribute them across Europe, a measure opposed by Britain. So far this year, about 64,000 people are thought to have attempted to cross from Africa to Europe. Our Europe correspondent Chris Morris is in Brussels for us. Hello, wide-ranging series of proposals to rescue people drowning in the Mediterranean, but also dealing with the vast flood of people who have reached European shores. There is a suggestion that 20,000 people should be resettled across Europe over the next couple of years, also a mandatory quota system to relocate asylum seekers who have already arrived. The vice chairman said it was no good shouting about saving lives and then staying silent when it comes to dealing with those who have been rescued -- the vice Commissioner. The renewed focus on Mediterranean migration began with tragedy. Hundreds have drowned at sea so far this year. Now there is a bigger naval force on patrol. These are pictures sent today from HMS Bulwark. More than 400 migrants rescued this morning 40 miles off the Libyan coast. But while everyone wants lives to be saved, there is much less agreement about how to cope with asylum seekers once they reach Europe. The European Commission is trying to change that. It is not acceptable for people around the EU to say, yes, stop people dying in the Mediterranean, and at the same time remain silent when the question is raised, what should happen to these people once they were saved in the Mediterranean. Some countries are being overwhelmed by migrant arrivals. Others are struggling to cope with the high number of people seeking asylum. Last year, Germany approved by far the largest number of asylum applications. Sweden said yes to the highest number compared to the size of its population. The UK approved several thousand fewer applications than France or Italy but far more than other large countries like Spain or Poland. Now the Commission wants to introduce a mandatory quota system to spread the burden of asylum seekers across the EU. Britain, along with Ireland and Denmark, can opt out, and the government says it will. Other countries may not be impressed. But in London, the focus is also on cracking down on the smuggling gangs and on ways to persuade fewer people to try to reach Europe in the first place. I think it is right that those who are not refugees, those who are economic migrants, that we do ensure that people who don’t have a right to come to Europe actually are being returned to Africa. Which is exactly what the commission’s proposals say, that a better system needs to be put in place to send back people whose asylum applications fail or who are simply economic migrants. In 2013, less than 40% of return orders were enforced effectively. As for who takes the lion’s share of those who stay, that is a much more divisive issue. And the Commission’s proposals today are just the starting point for a complex set of problems. Now national leaders will have to have their say. Stand by for plenty argument ahead. So Britain won’t take part in that quota system but it could pose one political problem for the government. If other countries feel Britain is not showing solidarity on this issue, then perhaps they will be less willing to show solidarity in other areas of policy which Britain seems to renegotiate. Thank you. David Cameron has outlined plans to introduce new legislation to crack down on extremism, saying Britain has been a ""passively tolerant society for too long"". The bill will include banning orders for groups who preach hate in public. Our home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford reports. The first meeting since the election this morning of the National Security Council, the ministers charged with maintaining the security of the UK. And an announcement of the first bill that will be in the Oueen’s speech, a counter extremism bill to combat those like Islamist radicals and neo-Nazis who are seen as damaging British society. Promoting this extremism, promoting this hatred, promoting intolerance, who are rejecting the values we share in Britain as a pluralistic society and of course what they can do, what that can lead to is poisoning young minds, radicalising individuals and that of course in due course can lead to individuals turning to violence. The bill will introduce banning orders for extremist organisations that undermine democracy, extremism disruption orders to prevent people inciting hatred and closure orders to shut down premises used to hold extremist meetings. Freed from the shackles of their coalition with the Liberal Democrats, the new Conservative government has moved quickly to put their counter extremism legislation on the agenda but there remain concerns both about its practicality and over whether it tramples on freedom of speech. Voting, asking someone to legislate in Parliament, is completely prohibited. The legislation is targeted at people like Anjem Choudary, who have managed to avoid counterterrorism legislation but are still seen by ministers as a danger to society. But civil liberties groups say it is the wrong approach. These proposals would clearly have a very damaging impact on other people’s right to freedom of expression so even if those views are being propounded which are objectionable, offensive, if they are not violent, I should have the strength, the confidence to engage with those properly without having to ban it. But ministers say Britain has been a passively tolerant society for too long and it is now time to confront head-on what they call the poisonous Islamist extremist ideology. Let’s cross to our assistant political editor Norman Smith. The simple fact that David Cameron has moved so quickly to unveil these powers just six days after the election underlines how seriously he views the threat from extremist preachers and organisations. It is also a visible symbol that we are in a new political era, the post coalition in Iraq. Previously, Nick Clegg would have been clinging on David Cameron’s coat-tail saying no, you don’t. -- David Cameron’s coat-tail saying no, you don’t. -- the post coalition era. I think it marks a significant tilt in government policy. It marks a more robust approach. Effectively, what Mr Cameron is suggesting is curbing one fundamental civil liberty, the right to free speech, in order to protect other liberties around democracy, rule of law, tolerance for other faiths and different religions. It is the age-old conundrum about how far democracies have to be prepared to curtail democracy to protect democracy. When you put it together with the fact that we know the government want to reintroduce the so-called snoopers’ government want to reintroduce the so-called snoopers’ charter, giving intelligence services more power to monitor our Internet, and they want to reform human rights legislation, I think that suggest the balance and scales between civil liberties and national security, the scales have now tipped decisively in favour of national security. A former police inspector who saw the youngest victims described going the at Hillsborough as hell. jon-Paul Gilhooley was the youngest victim at ten years old. judith Moritz is outside the court warrant now. Today was the turn ofjon-Paul Gilhooley. Aged ten, the youngest person to die. We heard he had gone to the match that day with his uncles and friends. They had a spare ticket and thought he would like to go. They had gone through the exit gate, Gates E, that we heard was opened by police and onto the terrace where the crash happened. We heard some of the men at the match with him had screamed and shouted, they had a child with them. And shouted, they had a child with them. An inspector Philip Woodward told the jury he knew something needed to be done, he went into those pens and he said it was like walking into hell. He saw the ten-year-old boy and realised he was around the same age as his own son. We heard a little from ambulance staff as well put talked about trying to help the little boy, how they tried to resuscitate him even though there were no signs of life. Harold was Wood said there was emotion attached to it, no getting away with it. Adults were also there but this was a ten-year-old boy and you somehow felt you had to keep going. Well the inquests are entering now and will continue for many months to hear the evidence about the movements of each of the 96 people who died in the worst stadium disaster in Britain. Labour’s executive committee have published its timetable today for the race to replace Ed Miliband as leader. Chuka Umunna and Liz Kendall have both said they’ll be standing. Our political correspondent Iain Watson reports. What next for the Labour Party. Two MPs have declared they want to replace Ed Miliband as party leader. Chuka Umunna and Liz Kendall. They want the party to broaden its appeal beyond traditional supporters. They are likely to be joint in a leadership race by Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham. Today the ruling National executive of Labour met to decide a timetable to elect a new leader. Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Rachel Reeves is not standing in this election but she says Labour must think about policy and notjust personality. We need time to reflect on what went wrong, why we lost so badly. And have some time to think about who the new leader will be. The National executive of Labour are discussing whether to hold an early leadership race with the results by the end of july, a special conference in the autumn, which seems most likely, to announce the new leader at the annual conference. When Ed Miliband was elected leader, the unions took a third of the votes. But all that has been swept away. The long task of rebuilding after the election result has already begun at the Labour head office. They’re hoping at the forthcoming leadership contest, there will be more support constructed for the party. The new leader will be elected on the basis of one member, one vote, but trade union members canjoin and some people say they will have a disproportionate effect on the overall result. I think we will have a significant number of trade union members having a say in this contest. Today the road to elect the next Labour leader will become clear but finding a way for the party to win the next election will take an awful lot longer. Our top story this lunchtime: The biggest real-terms rise in pay since the recession - and unemployment is down again. And still to come: Prince Harry does the Haka in New Zealand. Coming up in sport. A return to India is on the cards for Kevin Pietersen. With the England door closed, we understand the Surrey batsman is negotiating with his IPL team Sunrisers Hyderabad. The search is still on for a US Marines helicopter carrying eight people that went missing in Nepal during a relief mission after yesterday’s earthquake. More than 70 people have died and over 2000 have been injured in the disaster which came barely two and a half weeks after a first major earthquake killed thousands of people. The BBC’s Yogita Limaye has been to one of the buildings which collapsed as the latest quake struck Kathmandu. This is the roof of a four-storey building that collapsed in Kathmandu in the earthquake that struck Nepal yesterday. You can imagine the force that it had because this building was actually standing right there next to the building at the back which is still standing. It had already been damaged in the first earthquake on April the 25th and that is why people were not really going inside it. Nevertheless, there were about four or five people but they managed to run out because it only collapsed a few minutes after the earthquake. You can see there, people trying to salvage their belongings. One of the reasons why we have not seen the death toll from this earthquake rise as rapidly as after the first one is because many people were already living in temporary and open shelters. The second possible reason is because the epicentre was close to Mount Everest and since climbing season has been called off, there were not as many people in the area as there would have been because this is peak season for climbing. A US Marine helicopter that went out on a relief mission after the earthquake yesterday has been reported missing since late last evening. We had been told there were six Americans and two Nepalese personnel on board. They are trying to search for it, both on foot and by air. Rescue and relief teams are already stretched very thin, very hard task ahead of them and of this happening under the shadow and the fear of more earthquakes and after-shocks. The japanese car-makers Nissan and Toyota are to recall more than a quarter of a million cars in the UK between them - linked to a potential fault with their airbags. Our Industry Correspondent john Moylan is here with more details. How many cars How TT’ISIâ1y C3I’S BFE WE How many cars are we looking at? We think, 260,000 cars. Nissan has confirmed 100,000 vehicles in the UK including the likes of the pick-up, and Toyota has yet to give a number but we believe it is around 160,000 in the UK including popular models. The problem is with the airbag in these vehicles wished Toyota say could be susceptible to deploying abnormally. If your vehicle is affected by this you do not need to do anything, you will receive a letter from the car company and they will tell you where to bring the vehicle and they will check it out and if there is a component that needs replacing able to free of charge. There have been a of recalls involving japanese cars? Yes, it does affect the airbag which is made by japanese company. And does affect the airbag which is made byjapanese company. And it by japanese company. And it brings to 31 million the number of recalls worldwide associated with this. The company is facing a series of lawsuits in North America and problems with the airbags have been linked to six fatalities. It is worth saying that a recall is increasingly common these days as all the big companies use the same suppliers. And if they do not take things seriously, they could suffer damage to the reputation and so they have taken an ultra safe approach. So the number of recalls has grown. The South Korean spy agency says North Korea has executed its defence minister for ‘disrespecting’ Kim Yong Un - and for sleeping during a meeting. Hyon Yong Chol was reportedly shot by anti-aircraft gun at a shooting range in Pyongyang - watched by hundreds of people. Steve Evans reports from the South Korean capital, Seoul. You do not get much closer. A word in the ear of the supreme leader, the man with the power. Like the power to exclude those who step out of line. Only last month, Hyon Yong Chol spoke for North Korea at a big security conference in Moscow. But now he is out. Anti-aircraft guns were used to obliterate him on a firing range according to the South Korean spy agency. Claims about what is going on in North Korea should always be treated with huge scepticism. But in this case the South Korean intelligence agency is unlikely to make a statement which could be proved to be untrue very easily. If Hyon Yong Chol is still alive, very easily. If Hyon Yong Chol is stillalive, North still alive, North Korea would produce him and have him appear in public. If he does not, you have to assume that South Korea is getting it right. When Kim jong Un’s father died, though powerful people assembled around the coffin. In the US since all have been purged, some executed, some banished to obscurity. The brutal and public execution of Hyon Yong Chol underlines the ruthlessness, despite the shows of force, it seems that Kim jong Un feels insecure and is dangerous in that insecurity. If you go to your doctor’s surgery - chances are you want them to ‘do’ something - give you pills or order a blood test. But now doctors’ leaders have begun a campaign to stop what they’re calling the ""overtreatment"" of patients. The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges say doctors are giving some treatments unnecessarily. Our Health Correspondent Adam Brimelow reports. As signs advances, the question is what treatment to offer. The Academy of British medicine argues many people are being overdiagnosed with conditions that will not cause them problems, and over treated in ways that will not help and could even be harmful. The paper says that a culture has grown up of the more treatment, the better. Instead of steps based on an informed conversation in the consulting room, between doctor and patient. GP leaders say decisions should be based on mutual trust and the best evidence. Patients come to see their GP with expectations about what will come out of the consultation. This can be treatment, a referral, they want a new drug, but actually sometimes the best thing for the patient is just to do nothing. To wait and let nature take its course. The medical Royal colleges were each asked to suggest five treatments that should be stopped or scaled back. It should become a core part of medical training put up in patients should be held to raise concerns and understand that doing nothing could be the best approach. I want the patient to be able to go and ask the doctor, is this the best treatment, are there alternatives, is this the right time for this treatment for me. What else could I do to improve my health and improve this problem without going to the next stage of treatment. The Academy acknowledges there could be controversy but said it is worth it if it leads to better quality care. Already the charity Blood Pressure UK has defended the use of medication. Today was a day that Susan Pollack had been waiting for - and dreading - in equal measure. This morning she came face to face with one of the Nazi soldiers who held her prisoner in the horror and barbarity at Auschwitz - she told the court "" the terror still haunts my soul."". She would survive the concentration camp there, the death marches, and Belsen - many of her family did not. She is one of two Britons who gave evidence in the trial of ""The Bookkeeper of Auschwitz"" - 93-year-old Oskar Groening - charged with being an accessory to the murders of 300,000 Hungarian jews during the Second World War. He says he was only involved in collecting the belongings of the victims - and committed no crime. Richard Lister reports. Oskar Groening is one of the few people still alive who admits to his role in the Holocaust. In court he asked for forgiveness for what he called his moral responsibility for mass murder. But he denies doing any kidding himself. He was a book-keeper kidding himself. He was a book- keeper at Auschwitz, a kidding himself. He was a book-keeper at Auschwitz, a man book- keeper at Auschwitz, a man who counted the money taken from those sent to the camp to die. Susan Pollack was one of them. She survived the arch was and Belsen concentration camp and arrived at court today to testify against Oskar Groening. Whatan court today to testify against Oskar Groening. What an exciting time. My goodness. 50 members of her family were killed in the camps. She says the past cannot be forgotten. I was just a 13-year-old girl, sol the past cannot be forgotten. I was just a 13-year-old girl, so I do not remember his face any more. But I remember the feeling. I remember the feeling of terror. It is indescribable what that arrival meant. You could never imagine in a million years. The horror, the barbarity, just hit us. But Oskar Groening is now an old and sick man. Are those who say he should be left to die in peace, not in prison. Susan Pollack is not of them. -- not one of them. The whole structure of the Holocaust and the enormity of mass murder was constructed by individuals. Notjust Hitler and his gangsters. But everyone, however small, that supported the Nazi party had something to do with it. This case is a result of the change in German law, allowing the prosecution of those who worked at the death camps for complicity in mass murder. The change intended to bring more justice board the victims. The fact that a German court wants to listen to us, that in itself is to be honoured. Ido to us, that in itself is to be honoured. I do not look to us, that in itself is to be honoured. Ido not look for any revenge. But I am hopeful of justice, some way. And I’m not saying that a prison sentence will make much difference. It will not ring my family back. But perhaps we can influence the future. You’re watching the BBC News at One. Our top story today - average wages see the biggest rise for four years - and unemployment’s down too. In a moment we’ll have the weather- plus the news where you are. But first with the sport here’s Ore Oduba. Simon, a very good afternoon to you. We are talking about cricket first up. Kevin Pietersen is heading back to India on Friday, to rejoin the IPL side Sunrisers Hyderabad, after being told he wouldn’t be recalled to the England squad. He made some strong accusations in the Daily Telegraph, saying he felt misled and betrayed. Our sports correspondent joe Wilson is at the Oval, where Pietersen’s county side Surrey are in action - joe, what did you make of his comments? Kevin Pietersen’s primary concern right now will be a slight leg injury which has limited his participation in the final leg of this match. He will be looking forward now to participation in the 2020 tournament in India and the Caribbean. The ECB find themselves once again in an awkward position from a PR perspective today. Pietersen’s comments were very strong, accusing the ECB of being deceitful and leading him down the garden path. The ECB’s chairman I am sure will word a strong response to that. Other people will be conscious that anything they say today will prolong this Kevin Pietersen saga. I can tell you that guys who played with Kevin Pietersen for a long time will be feeling a weariness that for whatever reason, once again, they are dancing to Kevin Pietersen’s tune. Peter Moores is out, Kevin Pietersen is over to India, the matter closed for now. What is next in this chapter? Bear in mind that England have two test matches against New Zealand and at the moment there is no head coach. What would you be thinking if you are a prospective England coach candidate today? For one thing, who is in charge? You have a chairman Colin Graves, you have a new chief executive, Andrew Strauss in a new role as director, so who do you answer to? role as director, so who do you answerto? If answer to? If you see what happened to Peter Moores and you are a prospective coach candidate, do you think you will have the autonomy and the time to have yourjob. As Kevin Pietersen would no doubt say, trust is a two-way street. It is indeed. Thank you. Andy Murray has made a winning start at the Italian Open in Rome as he bids to win a third successive clay court title. He’s beaten Frenchmanjeremy Chardy in straight sets. Murray comes into this on the back of wins in Munich and Madrid and made a confident start breaking Chardy in the 7th game - that was enough to win the first set and he followed it up with a comfortable second, securing two breaks to win 6-4, 6-3. He will play David Goffin orjo-Wilfired Tsonga next. And we’ll finish with some brilliant pictures from cycling’s Giro D’Italia. So here we are - the finish of Stage 4. Italy’s Davide Formolo finished way ahead of the field for his first professional stage win. Some way further back was Australia’s Simon Clarke. His celebration suggests he thought he’d won it - before another rider points out that Formolo has already crossed the line! Clarke insisted later that he was just delighted to get the overall race leader’s pinkjersey. That’s all sport for now. Prince Harry, on tour in New Zealand, has immersed himself in Maori culture by taking part in a traditional Haka at a military base near Wellington. The prince spent 20 minutes rehearsing the war dance made famous by the New Zealand All Blacks rugby union team. An international study of how schools perform puts Asian countries in the top five places and the UK, 20th. The research uses data from tests taken by 15-year-old students in 76 countries. Singapore came top, followed by Hong Kong. Ghana is at the bottom, while Poland, Slovenia and Vietnam all do better than the UK. Sean Coughlan has more. It is claimed if you want to see the economy of tomorrow, look at the school system of today. That is going to be good news for some Asian countries with the world’s highest performing education systems. Here in Singapore, teenagers are at the top of the biggest ever global comparison of ability in maths and science. The country has worked hard to create a workforce ready for the global economy using English as the teaching language and investing in keeping its teacher’s skills up-to-date. Singapore has never taken its eye off the ball when it comes to core skills, such as maths and English, but they are well aware that to stay ahead they need to continue to adapt. That is the key message from this new education system. What is the point of these league tables? Are theyjust about creating a global report card with some countries passing and some failing? The message of this report which is going to be presented at a major United Nations conference next week is about how economies could grow if they raise their education standards. This is the first time that we have a truly global scale of quality of education and the idea is to give more countries, rich and poor, access to comparing themselves to the world education leaders to discover their strengths and weaknesses in education and to get an idea of what the local economic gains for improved schooling could be for them. These rankings include a much wider range of countries, showing how well pupils in Africa and Latin America compare with those in Europe and Asia. While these league tables show how schools are performing now, their purpose is to create an economic road map for the future. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Nick Miller. We go to cold to heat via a bit of rain. It was unusually cold for the time of year across rural parts of southern England. Gardeners, I hope you took note of that. There is still the risk of Frost for the next few nights. As I run through the next 24 hours, here comes an area of low pressure, replacing today’s fine weather. Tomorrow that will bring some soaking rain for some of us. Today, it is looking fine for most. In parts of Northern Ireland and northern England there could be an isolated light shower here and there. Louden up in the far south-west of England, particularly into Cornwall. -- brightening up. Tonight, that no pressure starts to show its hand pushing cloud from the south-west and then outbreaks of rain. It does mean a much mild night. Scotland, northern and eastern England will get a touch of frost. Gardeners and stargazers take note. You could catch a glimpse of the Northern lights. Here comes the rain into England and Wales but it does not get too far north. Some sunny spells still around. With the rain, I mentioned a soaking and quite a cold day to come with temperatures pegged down in some spots to single figures. Turning showery in south-west England later in the day. Some places could see 20 to 30 millimetres of rain. Some gardeners will be rejoicing at that prospect. This weather system coming in will spread outbreaks of rain to Scotland and Northern Ireland as we go through Friday. A fine start to the weekend. It looks as if we will see some more rain coming into western parts of the UK later. We will keep you updated. Breezy and cool this weekend. Where is the heat? You will have to go south. The Canaries are breaking a made temperature record. Iam Canaries are breaking a made temperature record. I am working this weekend but it is too hot for me. If you’re looking for a late getaway, Simon, that is an option. Time for the news where you are, good afternoon. Welcome to BBC London news. I’m Louisa Preston. Gangs are increasingly stealing money from cashpoints across the capital and using chemicals to blow them up. Criminals are pumping the ATM’s full of flammable gas which they then ignite. Some industry experts claim millions of pounds have been stolen from cashpoints across London in the last year and they’ve warned that it is only a matter of time before somebody gets seriously injured. Charlotte Franks has more. This is what extreme robbery looks like. Criminals in Holland are trying to blow up a cashpoint with flammable gas. Attacks like this have been happening across mainland Europe for some time. Now London has become a target, too. Shazid Karim owns this family-run pharmacy in Surrey. This is what happened when his cashpoint was blown up. Glass everywhere, mess, the whole shop was open and exposed. It was obviously the middle of the night in winter so it was very dark as well. We just got very scared. Criminals involved in these types of attacks use acetylene gas, which is ignited once pumped into the cashpoint. That will cause the explosion to start... We arranged a controlled experiment to reveal how risky a gas explosion like this can be. ",,

After a legal battle lasting ten years, confidential letters written by Prince Charles to Tony Blair and his ministers when Labour was in government, have been published. Clarence House has said the move would ""only inhibit"" the Prince’s ability to express concerns. The letters to seven government departments cover a wide range of subjects, including badger culling and herbal medicine. In one letter to the Prime Minister, Prince Charles said the armed forces were being asked to do a challenging job ""without the necessary resources."" Here’s our Royal Correspondent Nicholas Witchell. Concerned? Well Concerned ? Well he be. This was reached rushed job this morning out and about as usual, meeting people and listening to their concerns. Concerns when she often feels obliged to pass on in his private contact with governments. It is rare to see how those representations work, but here late this afternoon, a first sight of letters intended to be private, written by Prince Charles to government ministers ten years Prince, discharging a equipment provided to British forces was a sensitive medical issue. On the 8th of September was a sensitive medical issue. On the 8th of September 2001+ Prince Charles Road to the then promised Tony Blair saying, Ifear Charles Road to the then promised Tony Blair saying, I fear this Tony Blair saying, Ifear this is just one more example of where the armed forces are being asked to do a challenging job without the necessary resources. Clarence House I’1âCâSSSI’y I’âSOUI’CâS. Cl3I’âIâ1Câ House SAYS necessary resources. Clarence House says that Prince Charles has close links with the military, he is Colonel of several regiments and had a duty to raise concerns on their behalf. Then on agriculture, another area of concern to Prince Charles and especially the issue of a badger cull to prevent the spread of bovine TB to cattle, on the 21+th of February 2005 he wrote to Tony Blair saying, I urge you to look again at introducing a proper cult of badgers were necessary. Then on the reuse of derelict hospital buildings, another area of concern for Charles, he wrote to the then Secretary of State for Health about an old hospital in Sunderland. Ifear if for Health about an old hospital in Sunderland. I fear if the estates are transferred now without proper consideration, various chickens will come home to roost in your own department. Is that appropriate language to use to administer? Count-outs concedes the Prince may occasionally have used what they call the odd lively expression. Critics of the monarchy said that the letters prove a bigger point. Some of his views are splendid and advanced. Some are eccentric and some barmy. We should know what we are getting. He is going to be the head of state. And we should know what the views of the head of state are. It is suitable for the job that you mark but former ministers say the interventions do not necessarily have much impact. I never heard other ministers saying, we have had this letter from Charles. So the letters seem to be those of concern person who has made the David Telegraph and wants to tell everyone in government what he thinks. In every case Clarence House says that Prince Charles will simply with the issues of public concern and trying to find practical ways to address them. Nick is with me now. What do the letters tell us about Prince Charles? I think they tell us that he cares, he cannot walk past a problem, he wants and needs to make a difference otherwise what is his life as the heir to the throne about. He feels he has a duty to raise these issues. He has been going round absorbing news from people for longer than many ministers have been alive. The style is sometimes blunt. He said any pressure that could be brought to bear on badger culling would be welcome. He called the badger lobby intellectually dishonest. But the question is whether the people who received the letters, do they feel intimidated, pressured by them? The overwhelming response from government and visitors of all governments have been yes, we receive these letters and consider them but do not necessarily take any notice. The tour operator Thomas Cook ""breached their duty of care,"" according to the jury at an inquest into the deaths of two young children in Corfu in 2006. Bobby and Christi Shepherd, who were aged six and seven, died of carbon monoxide poisoning from a faulty boiler while they were on holiday. The jury today delivered a verdict of unlawful killing. Danny Savage reports. A little brother with his big sister, excited to be on holiday. But a faulty boiler in a Greek hotel, spewing out poisonous fumes, killed Christi and Bobby Shepherd. Nearly nine years on a coroner’s court concluded they were unlawfully killed. Their parents blame Thomas Cook who the holiday was booked with. It is clear that Thomas Cook could and should have identified that lethal boiler. Thomas Cook put Christi and Bobby in that bungalow and I will always hold Thomas Cook responsible for their deaths. Thomas Cook failed our family. That boiler should have been checked. Ruth and I nearly died in that bungalow. The bottom line is had Thomas Cook followed its own policy, Christi and Bobby would be alive today. It was in this bungalow that Bobby and Christie started feeling sick one evening. The following day the maid found the children dead and the adults ina coma. This decrepit boiler adjoining their rooms was producing lethal amounts of carbon monoxide. The hotel manager and two of the staff were later found guilty of manslaughter. Two Thomas Cook holiday reps rats were cleared. But the family lawyer had this message today for the tour operator. Thomas Cook should hang its head in shame as a result of these deaths. You take money from families like this family, who expect to go on holiday and have the time of their lives. They do not expect to return from holiday with their children in coffins. But in relation to the deaths of Christi and Bobby, Thomas Cook say they were cleared of any wrongdoing in the Greek courts. Thomas Cook also said they have revised all those checksum and procedures that take place at the properties that the use and present customers to around the world. Back here at the coroner says he population of the UK are out of work - the lowest figure for seven years. Wages excluding bonuses were up 2.2%. But the good news was tempered by a more pessimistic outlook from the Bank of England, which cut its forecasts for economic growth, wages and productivity. Here’s our Economics Editor Robert Peston. If you want to work in a butcher or beautician in Hounslow, it is the place to be. Demand for service sectorjobs is booming. Nationally there is some of that too as unemployment drops to levels we have not seen since before the great crash. They are on average is almost 2% higher across the whole of the UK, where something with inflation having banished. And locally there are hotspots. We are beginning to notice the shortage in the labour supply and a shortage ofjob-seekers coming onto the market. What we are finding in the last few months, we have had to increase the wage costs by up to 6% to maintain those people. The UK recovery is continuing but at a slower pace than the Bank of England forecast just three months ago. It then expect to GDP to rise by 2.9% in 2015 and 2016. Today it provides the growth down to 2.5% this year and 2.6% next year. Part of the reason for the downgrade is it is gloomier about a long-awaited revival of relativity or the output of workers per hour. Productivity is 17% low grade would have been if pre-crash trends have been sustained. That means in effect we are 17% poorer. This year the Bank of England expects productivity growth ofjust not .25%, negligible. Rising to a still low 1.25% next year. How worried should we be that you have downgraded your expectations for growth in productivity? It is the nature of jobs and people filling jobs. Some of thesejobs are jobs and people filling jobs. Some of these jobs are lower productivity, so we have had a disproportionate number of those. That is cyclical and it weighs on product liberty. The second thing is you get people who are new to jobs were not productive, as they are with time. So although it is great that employment has risen to record levels, as the governor says, many newjobs are not fantastically highly paid or high quality. And another thing the tightening of the labour market means that wage rises could refuel inflation. And that means the long years of almost zero interest rates make yen -- means the long years of almost zero interest rates make yen -- may end injust over a year. The Royal Navy has rescued more than 1+50 migrants from the Mediterranean, who were trying to reach Europe on 30-foot long inflatable dinghies. It comes as the European Commission has proposed a scheme to offer 20,000 refugees the right to resettle in countries across the EU, a measure Britain opposes. Our Europe Correspondent Chris Morris reports from Brussels. 1+0 miles off the Libyan coast this morning. Throwing a lifeline to more than 1+00 migrants, adrift on inflatable boats. The British warship HMS Bulwark is saving lives. A chairfor a pregnant woman. The migrants will be taken to Italy and Britain is playing its part in the Mediterranean. But is it doing enough elsewhere? The European Commission is calling for more solidarity. It is not acceptable for people around the EU to say yes, stop people dying in the Mediterranean, and at the same time remain silent when the question is raised, what should happen to these people once they have been saved from the Mediterranean? Some countries are being overwhelmed by migrant arrivals, others are struggling to cope with huge numbers of asylum applications. Last year Germany approved by far the largest number, while Sweden took the most compared to the size of its population. The UK approved fewer than France or Italy, but far more than other large countries like Spain and Poland. So the Commission plans a mandatory quota system to spread asylum seekers across the EU. Britain will use its opt out. There’s also a proposal to resettle 20,000 genuine refugees who have not yet reached Europe. But Britain insists far more people should be sent home. Which is exactly what the Commission’s proposal suggests, a better system to return economic migrants, or people whose asylum applications fail. Who takes the lion’s share of those who stay, though? That is still the divisive issue. And this is just the starting point for a complex set of problems. Stand-by for plenty of arguments ahead. David Cameron’s been setting out a series of new powers to tackle extremism, saying that Britain has been a ""passively tolerant society"" for too long. The plans include new orders to ban extremist organisations and to restrict the activities of people who try to radicalise others. Critics say it’s the causes of extremism that should be targetted. Our Home Editor Mark Easton reports. Back against a background of hundreds of radicalised young British Muslims heading to fight for Islamic State and the danger they might pose on return, the government wants to deal with the threat at source, introducing banning orders for extremists who undermine British values. What we are introducing in the legislation is an ability to deal with those individuals who are promoting this hatred and intolerance. I think that is important. We are one nation, one society together and we need to deal with those who seek to divide us. Some suggest the proposed legislation has been prompted by one man, Anjem Choudary, a supporter of Al-Qaeda who the authorities have been unable to silence because of free speech rules. Why can’t we express these views? Surely if you believe in freedom of expression and democracy you should embrace the fact that we can say these things. The government continue with a very violent foreign policy. The problem for the government will be defining extremism without damaging the very democratic freedoms that ministers wish to defend. At the heart of our democracy is Parliament Square where statues on a great statesman but how many of these characters would pass and extremism test? Nelson Mandela advocated the violent overthrow of the South African state. Mahatma Gandhi was jailed the South African state. Mahatma Gandhi wasjailed by the British force edition, his extremism too much for Lloyd George. After losing an election, Winston Churchill described democracy as the worst form of government. Before adding, apart from all the others. Protest and radicalism have long been associated with students at the London School of economics. What do some of the current crop make of the proposals? What is extremism? The government has not been very clear UP government has not been very clear up about how it defines extremism. We could have students being taken out as people who the government doesn’t like very much. What are British values? To me a big part of thatis British values? To me a big part of that is being able to be in a society where you can challenge the views of the establishment. It’s almost exactly two years since the horrific murder of Fusiliers Lee Rigby on the streets of London, an anniversary that some may say would remind us why a balance must be found between free speech and national security. The time is 17 minutes past six, our top story... Private letters written by Prince Charles Later on BBC London: A mother and her twin daughters are found dead at a house in north-east London. Their father’s body is found nearby. And the fight for City Hall is on. Who will the Labour Party choose to run for mayor? of taking so-called legal highs. In Nepal, hundreds of thousands of people have spent the night out in the open after a major earthquake, the second in less than three weeks, struck yesterday. 76 people died, a figure that is expected to rise. The latest earthquake was centred on several districts in the foothills of the Himalayas. This town was already a hub of rescuers and aid after the first earthquake. just when Nepal was beginning to get back to normal... Another huge earthquake has reminded this countryjust how vulnerable it is. You see a lot of shaved heads here in Nepal, like the white clothes they are symbols of mourning. This family lost their home and their grandmother in the first earthquake. Yesterday they lost her son Arjun. A husband and a father. TRANSLATION: He was very hard-working. He WGS S good mal’]. Arjun was one of nine people who died here in the town of Tretari yesterday. He had come in on his motorbike to collect some earthquake relief for his family. A tent and some food. My world has been destroyed. I’m like a house without a foundation. I don’t think I’ll everfeel safe again. There was no delay getting aid here, no shortage of willing hands to help. A fleet of helicopters brought the injured into Kathmandu. But what no one can help with is the fear. The fear that you’re not safe, that another quake will strike. Because the scientists say there will be more earthquakes here. justin Rowlatt, BBC News. Labour has set out a timetable to elect a new leader. He or she will be named on September 12th. This evening, the Shadow Health Secretary, Andy Burnham, officially added his name to the list of those wishing to replace Ed Miliband. Carole Walker is in Westminster for us. A four month wait then? Yes, quite a long contest stretching over the summer until we get the new leader in place, on the 12th of September, a couple of weeks before Labour’s annual conference. One member, one vote. Overthe Labour’s annual conference. One member, one vote. Over the next three months, new members canjoin the Labour Party as affiliated or registered supporters and get a vote in the contest. Some have said that that will allow unions to get lots of their people in and sway the vote but the party says no, this is about opening up the process as much as possible and the influence of the unions has been curtailed. As you mentioned, Andy Burnham is the latest contender to throw his hat into the ring. The Shadow Health Secretary says that he is going to rediscover Labour’s beating heart and can reach out to all parts of the country. He will probably be one of five candidates out and about around the country, trying to win over supporters and explain how they would rebuild and reshape the Labour Party after its shattering defeat. Many thanks. A 1+5-year-old man has been found hanged near a reservoir in north-east London, hours after the bodies of his twin daughters and their mother were discovered at their home. Police forced entry to a house in Chadwell Heath yesterday afternoon and found the bodies of a woman, thought to be 37, and two girls, believed to be 13. The trial of a former Nazi death camp guard has resumed in Germany. Oskar Groening, now 93, was known as ""the book-keeper of Auschwitz"" and is charged with at least 300,000 counts of accessory to murder. One of those giving evidence is Susan Pollack, a British survivor. jenny Hill has been speaking to her. They call it a death camp, but this was murder on an industrial scale. Injust eight In just eight weeks at Auschwitz, the Nazis killed 300,000 people. And this man saw it happen. Oskar Groening was proud to be in the SS. He became a guard and a book-keeper the SS. He became a guard and a book- keeper at Auschwitz. Nearly a lifetime later, he admits he witnessed atrocities, he knew about the gas chambers, but claimed he was never directly involved. He would have been there when this girl arrived with her family. Susan’s mother was killed immediately. Today she faced oskar Groening across a courtroom. I did glance at him very briefly and I came to the conclusion... I don’t have any hate in my heart. I don’t know him. But I don’t ready recognise him. As someone I should feel some sort of empathy with. Can you forgive him? Not for me to forgive. This is a town where oskar Groening was born and it is the town where he is on trial. He has already admitted he is morally guilty. But what the court here must decide now is this, simply by working at a death camp, by being part of the Nazi machine, was oskar Groening complicit in mass murder? 70 years after Auschwitz was liberated, he may be the last Nazi to face justice. Brass bands and ballet are an unlikely combination, but they’re brought together in a new work marking the 30th anniversary of the end of the miners’ strike. The stand-off between the miners and the Thatcher government was bitter and as well as protesters going head to head with police, the lasting images of that time include the brass bands made up of miners, which are now remembered in dance. Our Arts Editor Will Gompertz has more. The valleys of South Wales, formed by mother nature and hard labour. Rolling hills and grassed over slag heaps of a barely visible reminder of a coal-mining past. But that way of life finished when the strike ended. The mines have all but gone. But tradition lives on in the form of the brass band. BRASS BAND PLAYS. It really represents the musical identity of the community more than anything. What you have is that sense of belonging, that you belong to a community and that you belong to a tradition that is based in mining. Even though the mines are not still around with us, the music resonates with what has gone in the past. just a few decades ago, most of the players in this band would spend their days down a coal mine like this, removing coal from the face using these sort of tools. The current players are swapping the Welsh valleys for the London stage, where they will provide the music and the context for a new ballet, which looks back at the dark and troubled past of this mining community, whilst contemplating a more hopeful future. The piece is called Dark Arteries and is a collaboration between the band, the composer Gavin Higgins and the Rambert dance company. It starts with a movement about industry and the landscape and then moves onto the strike and associated conflict, which still goes deep with many people but means little to dancers who were neither there or even aware of this piece of recent British history. You have to kind of pull from something personal. So for me I think about the sense of community. You know, I don’t have a connection with the miners’ strike necessarily but I do have a connection with what it feels like to be in a place of struggle. The third movement is more optimistic, musing on what the legacy might be for mining communities. Whatever that is, the Tredegar Town brass band is likely to play its part, performing music that connects the past to the present. Will Gompertz, BBC News. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s john Hammond. All change. It was a beautiful day in Dorset. This picture was taken in Studland. Very wet across South areas and the best of the sunshine will be further north. Some cloud will continue to dissolve. For stargazers, you might see the Northern lights across some northern areas, fingers crossed. Rain pushing into the south-west late in the night. Parts of Scotland and North England, temperatures close to freezing. It will be milder further south and west but there is a catch. It will be wet first thing in the morning, some heavy rain across the West Country and south Wales. The motorway network could be badly affected. Parts of the South Midlands and southern parts of East Anglia, some places having persistent rain all day long. Beneath those rain clouds, my word it will be chilly, seven or 8 degrees for much of the day. In stark contrast, further north we will be basking in sunshine and some parts of Scotland will be up to 17 or 18 degrees. It will be a day of contrasts north to south. The dividing line somewhere across the Midlands. Anywhere north of that will be fine and anywhere south of that, not so. Tomorrow night will see a touch of frost across northern areas. Some sunshine on Friday. Parts of East Anglia and the south-east it will stay that way. We will see some dampness turning up across parts of Northern Ireland and western Scotland as we go through the second half of the day on a freshening breeze. What about the weekend? For Saturday, bright and breezy for many of us. On Sunday it will turn to cloud over with some persistent rain. A reminder of our main story. Letters written by Prince Charles to government ministers have been published after a ten-year legal battle. That’s all from the BBC News at Six. So it’s goodbye from me, and on BBC one we nowjoin the BBC’s On the programme tonight: The father who killed his four-year-old daughter after fighting to take her back from foster carers.

A father who beat his four-year-old daughter to death at their home in Hatfield is tonight facing a lengthyjail sentence after being found guilty of her murder. Carl Wheatley had fought for custody of Alexa-Marie Quinn, who’d been living with foster carers, so he could get more benefits and better housing. Her injuries were so bad, he hid her from public view and lied to social workers and her teachers. An investigation is now underway into why Wheatley was granted custody. Yvonne Hall reports. Cradled in her father’s arms, four-year-old Alexa-Marie Quinn. In public, an image of loving care, but in private, Carl Wheatley was beating his daughter so badly she eventually suffered fatal internal injuries. Fat released by the force of his blows blocked her lungs. They were horrendous injuries. Very distressing for me and the officers to deal with. And they are without doubt the most appalling injuries I have seen on a child. It is beggars belief how anybody would be able to cause or inflict that level of injury upon a child of that age. Alexa-Marie’s tragic story began when she was just two years old. Her mother could not look after her and she was in foster care until her father won a custody battle, partly to get more benefits and better housing. Carl Wheatley began beating his daughter after she came to live with him here in Queen Bee Court, Hatfield. The jury at St Albans Crown Court was told that on one occasion he had hit her so hard he knocked out a tooth and then went onto the internet to try to find out how to stick it back in and how to treat serious head injuries and bruising. Her injuries were so bad he had her hidden from public view and lied to social workers and teachers. And just three months after little Alexa-Marie came to live here, she was dead, her body covered in 68 bruises and cuts. Carl Wheatley, a 30-year-old supermarket worker, denied murder and admitted manslaughter on the grounds of an attention deficit disorder. But the prosecution said... He got angry if he did not get his own way and it is my belief he took out that anger on his four-year-old daughter. The jury agreed and returned a unanimous guilty verdict. Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire social services are now holding a serious case review to find out why Carl Wheatley was given custody and whether or not he was properly supervised once Alexa-Marie was living with him. Its findings are expected to be made public by the end of the year. Yvonne Hall, BBC London News, St Albans Crown Court. Coming up later in the programme: The fight for City Hall is on. Who will the Labour Party choose to run for mayor? A mother and her twin daughters have been found dead at a house in north-east London. The body of their father has been discovered hanging at a reservoir in Walthamstow. Alice Bhandhukravi is in Chadwell Heath now. What further details are there at this stage? And in this where the discovery was made. Police remain guarding the door and inside it is a crime scene with forensics officers inside. Police have said they were called just a day and a forced entry at lunchtime in response to concern about the welfare of the residents. Inside they found the bodies of a 37-year-old woman and her twin I3-year-old daughters. Police have not formally identified them, but they have been in the book away as 37-year-old -- they have been in the book away as 37-year-old -- but they have been named. They are trying to find the father of the family. They discovered the 1+0-year-old body of a man, he was found hanged some distance away at a local reservoir. Police are not looking for anyone else in connection with this incident which has shocked people living nearby. Every time you watch the school, judo is to see the mother. They were very protective of the children. How do you feel about this? It is a huge shock. They were very quiet girls. It is really bad. We do not yet know the cause of death of the mother and her two daughters. The police have not carried out a postmortem examination yet. We have not had the results yet. They have not said if there is any sign of injuries on the mother or the daughters. They have yet to inform the next of kin, who we are told, live outside of the UK. We are told that the IPCC, the police watchdog, is now investigating because police said they were called to this address the night before the discovery of the bodies. They have said that there was no sign of any disturbance and therefore the West. The IPCC watchdog is investigating. -- therefore the left. -- The IPCC watchdog is investigating. -- therefore the left. -- in the left. Blowing up cash machines on the high street using flammable gas is the extreme tactic being used by criminals in London. And it’s on the rise. Financially, it’s costing the industry millions but there are warnings that it could also cost lives. As Charlotte Franks reports. This is what extreme robbery looks like. Criminals in Holland are trying to blow up a cashpoint with flammable gas. Attacks like this have been happening across mainland Europe for some time. Now London has become a target, too. Shazid Karim owns this family-run pharmacy in Surrey. This is what happened when his cashpoint was blown up. Glass everywhere, mess, the whole shop was open and exposed. It was obviously the middle of the night in winter so it was very dark as well. We just got very, very scared. Criminals involved in these types of attacks use acetylene gas, which is ignited once pumped into the cashpoint. We’ll fire an igniter. That will cause the explosion to start... We arranged a controlled experiment to reveal how risky a gas explosion like this can be. In this case, we used hydrogen, because acetylene is too dangerous. Acetylene is extremely flammable. It has got a very high burning velocity. The rates are pressurised in a vessel as you see here, it would be even greater than with the hydrogen explosion you have just seen. Attempts to blow up cashpoints are happening all over London. A Freedom of Information request to the Metropolitan Police revealed two years ago there was one attack. Last year it rose to 21. This is a device which will detect any attack on the machine... Experts are so concerned about these types of attacks, they believe they could be fatal, as well as costing banks millions of pounds. They have designed technology to try to prevent them. If there is an attack on the machine, not only does it blow the machine up and create damage to the machine, and potentially blow the front of the shop or branch out, that could cause serious injury to a passer-by. Those in the industry and explosives experts, have told us it is only a matter of time before somebody gets seriously injured. Despite these warnings, the police won’t talk to us about it. We have asked for an interview multiple times but on every occasion, we have been told no one is available. Banning extremist organisations and disrupting the activities of individuals is at the heart of the government’s plan to tackle radicalisation. The proposal for the new law was prompted in part by the killing of Fusilier Lee Rigby in 2013. But already there are concerns that the measures could do more harm than good. Our home affairs correspondent, Nick Beake’s has been gauging reaction in Woolwich. The centre of town was bathed in sunshine today. The starkest of contrasts from the darkest of days in the Woolwich two years ago. For many the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby was the most brutal attack on our way of life since july the 7th. The Prime Minister said today that there had been too much tolerance shown the extremists who had to be tackled head on. We found support for that claim. Tony Brown is a retired businessman. Have we been too soft for too long? Definitely. That attack on that views beer was terrible. It is absolutely disgusting. The government is correct to do more. This student also agrees. Depending on the actions, I would also agrees. Depending on the actions, Iwould be actions, I would be tough on it. They have to be tough than before? Yes. This is a full-time mother to her daughter Miracle. They must be called to order. They do not want to encourage others. One of the tellers was once part of the extremist group that had the strong presence in the south-east of London. Other lot -- he preached here and tried to get people to come to listen to him from outside this shop. The government now wants to prevent individuals or groups from promoting a poisonous ideology. Some worry who will be targeted. Mark Stacey trainee quantity surveyor after serving time in prison. Ido not want it to be an excuse to stop lots of young youths. jeremie Boga beast that new laws could cause divisions. They are looking to target particular communities, presumably the Islamic communities, and all that will do will alienate people and create further radicalisation. With new powers be an overdue crackdown or an attack on freedom of speech? It is a debate that will affect generations for many. -- many months. Next, the Labour Party is now not only looking for a leader but today the campaign began in earnest to find out who will become Labour’s candidate for London Mayor. The MP for Tooting, Sadiq Khan, officially entered the race. And Diane Abbott, the MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, reiterated her bid to stand. Here’s our political correspondent Karl Mercer. This is the estate where I was brought up in. They have changed the numbering now. Expect to hear more of this in the coming weeks The working-class boy done good is a message Sadiq Khan hopes will see him to City Hall. The first thing is for me to reach out to as many Londoners as possible. Once I have become a candidate, I will send out policies over the next few days and weeks. I would remind all Labour Party supporters and all those standing for candidate, only once has the Labour Party candidate been victorious. Sadiq Khan, 20 5000, 283. -- 25,283. This was Sadiq Khan five days ago Getting re-elected as MP for Tooting Less than a week on he’s confirmed he wants to be Labour’s candidate for mayor. Being me is a dreamjob. It Being me is a dream job. It makes me excited, the hairs on the back of my neck stand upjust excited, the hairs on the back of my neck stand up just thinking about it. All of my energies are focused on this. Before and I was trying to get the Labour Party back into power. That, as we know, didn’t happen, but Khan masterminded the Labour campaign in the capital that saw them gain seven seats and last year’s good London council results. He’ll hope that counts in his favour against his likely rivals. Tottenham MP David Lammy says he’ll run. Tessa jowell is likely to declare next week. Transport journalist Christian Wolmar is in the race, as is Hackney MP Diane Abbott. The challenge in London is to get people in the older borrowers to vote. I was brought up in Harrow. I really believe I am the I to appeal to the inner-city and the suburbia, where I grew up. Ido not think you could describe yourself as Ms Suburbia! Labour today agreed to put back its mayoral selection dates to match its leadership contest. It means we’ll know who their candidate is in the second week of September. Still to come this Wednesday evening: ~ I have kind of given up hope of becoming Wimbledon champion, sol know at the age of 1+2 it is all about fitness! How you can play tennis too - for free - this weekend. And: The first major exhibition of Irish art will be held in the capital for 30 years, it is happening now! Now to an idea that’s either bonkers or brilliant. Should London be turned into a National Park? Well, it will if one Londoner gets his way. And he claims it’ll make the city a better place for all of us to live in. So how on earth could it work? Tom Edwards has been to speaking to him. You’d best explain, Tom. Yes, it is an absolutely beautiful evening here at Alexandra Palace and behind me, you will be able to make out the landscape of London, you will probably be able to see the shark and the city and Canary Wharf, but also just how green it is and how many trees there are. That is why campaigners want to turn it into a national park city. For its size, it is one of the greenest cities in the world. It includes parks, gardens, Commons and nature reserves, and nearly half of the capital -- reserves, and nearly half of the capital-- capital is green space. A campaign wants to make London a national park city, to emphasise those open spaces. National parks are special places where people care about nature and enjoy it. To make London the first national park city would inspire people to think about how they can enjoy and care about nature more. Bothered you are a child planting a flower in your garden or an architect designing a new housing estate and thinking about how you can make it green and affordable, we can all take inspiration from this. -- affordable, we can all take inspiration from this. -- water and you are. The sparks conserve natural duty and wildlife and heritage. These national Park food have control over planning which does not happen at the moment in the capital. The Green Party believe this is a fantastic opportunity to try to improve the environment in London. This is a local nature art and is 30 years old. -- This is a local nature art and is 30 years old. -- arc. The wildlife trust has welcomed this idea. -- wildlife Park. Organisations like ourselves try to promote the environment but we are relatively small player is against the bigger organisations. It is a galvanising umbrella motion towards the 21st-century. I know it sounds like a crazy idea, but I asked some people and they thought it was bonkers but brilliant. They understood that it could improve health, biodiversity and the quality of wildlife. The improved green spaces could improve opportunities for education and for people who want to retire. Why would they not do it? It is early days in the campaign but there are high hopes that becoming a national park, the capital’s green spaces will get the recognition and for the protection they deserve. The campaigners are now carrying out a consultation. They are also fundraising to try to get more publicity. They have just told me, it is the first day of the fundraising, and they have raised ÂIo,000 alt of their target of £30,000. So it already seems that people are keen about this. -- £30,000. So it already seems that people are keen about this. -- out of there. Thank you for that update. So as Andy Murray currently goes from strength to strength on clay And with Wimbledon just around the corner... It’s perhaps a little surprising that the number of people playing tennis is on the decline. Well, to try and change that, the Lawn Tennis Association is laying on a weekend of sessions this weekend. Chris Slegg has more. Fun in the sun in south-west London this morning with around seven weeks to Wimbledon gets under way and the tennis rackets were out in full force. Following Andy Murray’s 2039 Wimbledon victory, you would be forgiven for thinking that tennis participation is going up. At the grassroots level, however, it is not. It has gone down. So the Lawn Tennis Association is trying to launch a recent initiative that will help to reverse the decline. Seven years ago, 535,000 people were playing tennis each week nationwide. That has now dropped to 381+,000. This weekend, at 57 London venues, there will be the tennis sessions as part of what the LTE calls the Great British Tennis Weekend. -- part of what the LTE calls the Great British Tennis Weekend. -- Lawn Tennis Association. Why do you think that the Lawn Tennis Association has not capitalised on the success of Andy Murray? They have not done enough to provide opportunities. This weekend will allow Ted still have fun and perhaps pick up the game later in the summer.-- children. Some have said that your salary, is too high, high would you respond to that? When I talk about our spending, respond to that? When I talk about ourspending, it our spending, it is not £26 million in marketing, it is in participation spending that includes marketing. We have a huge challenge and we must focus our sport and grow it to increase participation and it will take resources to do that. Bothered you are a former US Open finalist or just plain for fun, all are invited. I got involved in tennis playing with my father. This is a great initiative. I have given up hope of becoming Wimbledon champion, so it isjust about becoming Wimbledon champion, so it is just about fitness for me! To see whether this Great British Tennis Weekend can help do great things for British tennis, over to you! Football- and Leyton Orient manager, Fabio Liverani, has left the club by mutual consent. The Italian became the team’s fourth manager of the season back in December, but was unable to prevent them being relegated to League Two. And in cricket, Kevin Pietersen missed day four of Surrey’s County Championship match today with a calf injury as his team beat Leicestershire. Pietersen went to hospital for a scan a day after being told he would not be selected for England. Fellow international Moeen Ali says he believes England can become a ""strong side"" without Pietersen. We all know he is a great player and a fantastic cricketer. We saw his triple hundred yesterday. A lot of people miss him, but as players we have to move on and try to build upon creating a stronger side. The first major show of Irish art in London for over 30 years opens this week. The century’s worth of works is taken from a collection that was assembled by a bank, and after the financial crisis became available for the nation to view. Our arts correspondent Brenda Emmanus has been to take a look. A St Patrick’s Day parade in the capital, an annual celebration of Irish heritage and culture, but a new exhibition in central London hopes to expose visitors to another of Ireland’s cultural exports, their artists. Many of the great Irish artists have lived in Britain and people have to understand that in the past Irish painters came to London in particular because this was a place that they could pursue their careers. The Art Of Are Nation the first major show of its kind in the capital for 30 years. Many of the artists will be unfamiliar to visitors but some like Sean Scully and jack Yates have international reputations. It is interesting to have some of these great paintings on display in London at a time when people are perhaps we’re of the portrait of William Butler Yeats. The artwork here shows how the artistry of Ireland’s painters has evolved. This man has created stained-glass windows for Westminster Abbey. The painter is secured then this exhibition about hosting a social at another gallery. What do you hope comes out of this exhibition about Ireland and its artist? It is a snapshot and we hope that it will show more than the tip of the iceberg of Irish art. It is a particular selection. It is a connoisseur’s selection, very historical. It is not Mrs Ali reflect a broad range of work that is being done at this moment. But I hope that people will find it interesting and engaging and that some of the artists included will be surprised. It’s that time of the evening for a check on the weather. Nick Miller has the forecast for us. Yes, a big change on the way. Let us talk about today firstly. 20 degrees for many of us this afternoon.

The main headlines: Secret letters written by Prince Charles to government ministers have been published following a long court battle. They’ve been called the ""black spider memos"" because of the Prince’s distinctive hand-writing. An inquestjury has concluded the travel company, Thomas Cook, breached its duty of care when two children died on a holiday in 2006. Bobby and Christi Shepherd were killed in Corfu by carbon monoxide poisoning. Unemployment has fallen to its lowest level in seven years. It went down by 35,000 in the first quarter of the year, to just over 1.8 million. A father who beat his four-year-old daughter to death in Hatfield has been found guilty of murder.

And the recording of a police officer allegedly planning to hide an assault on a student. Good evening. Confidential letters written by Prince Charles to Tony Blair and his Ministers when Labour was in Government have been published after a ten-year legal battle. The letters to seven Government departments cover a wide range of subjects, including badger culling and herbal medicine. In one letter to the Prime Minister, Prince Charles said the Armed Forces were being asked to do a challenging job without the necessary resources. Clarence House has said publishing the letters would only inhibit the Prince’s ability to express concerns. Here’s our Royal correspondent Nicolas Witchall. Good morning, Sir. Business as usual? Well, not quite. Keep your eye on the left of the screen. That scraping noise was the sound of Charles’ official getting to grips with the TV microphone. So no answers today but lots of evidence of what Charles’ critics would call meddling as the letters governments have tried to keep secret for ten years were finally published. Let’s go back to 2004. It was just after the Iraq war, military equipment was a sensitive political issue. A replacement for the Lynx helicopter had been delayed by budgetary issues. On 8th September 2004 Prince Charles wrote to the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair: I fear this is one more example of where our armed forces are being asked to do an extremely challenging job, particularly in Iraq, without the necessary resources. Clarence House points out that Charles has close links with the Armed Forces. He feels that he has a responsibility to make representations on their behalf. Another of Charles interests is agriculture. Ten years ago, he was exercised about the sensitive question of a badger cull to protect cattle from bovine TB. On 24th February 2005 Charles wrote to Prime Minister Blair: So all I can say is that I do urge you to look again at introducing a proper cull of badgers where it is necessary. Elsewhere in the letters, Charles describes the arguments of the badger lobby as intellectually dishonest. He says the Office of Fair Trading is becoming a serious obstacle. He warned another Minister that chickens will come home to roost in your own department if he didn’t take certain actions. Clarence House says Charles is simply doing his duty and raising issues of public concern in these letters. But former Government advisors say he does sometimes exercise disproportionate influence. He’s given the ear of Ministers in a way that campaigners and charities do not get. Then the question hangs over it all, what influence has he then had over these many decades of writing these letters to all Ministers in all departments in a way that the public simply doesn’t know about? Critics of the monarchy say that if the institution is to survive, an heir to the throne must be absolutely neutral on public issues. It’s essential that that person is politically inert and is not getting involved in a partisan way in politics and it appears that Prince Charles did. And if he did he’s been doing it for 65 years of his life, he’s likely to do the same in future. But most former Ministers seem to be relaxed. Do they think Charles interferes? I don’t think so. Government receives letters from very important people, the Archbishop of Canterbury, other people, business leaders, people who have an opinion, like all MPs do, why shouldn’t Prince Charles write the odd letter if he thinks he’s got something he wants to get off his chest? So a meddling future monarch or a caring Prince trying to make a difference for the better? Read these letters and both interpretations are possible. Nicolas Witchall is outside Buckingham Palace now. Are these letters damaging to the Prince? I think it depends broadly on where you are starting from. If you are a critic of the Prince, if you are a critic of the monarchy and you find it offensive someone should have influence in that position, you will find these letters as evidence of unacceptable meddling. If you are broadly sympathetic to the idea of someone like Charles who has been going around the country seeking opinions for the best part of 50 years now, longer than many Ministers have been alive, then I don’t think that you will find the language broadly of these letters unacceptable. Charles cares. He wants, he needs, Ithink, to unacceptable. Charles cares. He wants, he needs, I think, to feel that he makes a difference. Otherwise what’s the point of being in his position? And the critical point surely is this, that the recipients of the letters, the Ministers, sometimes they’ve been irritated by them, Tony Blair was irritated by Charles position on GM crops and fox hunting I5 years ago but broadly they welcome these letters. They appear not to feel pressured or intimidated by them. Will Charles stop writing these letters? The answer to that is simple, he will not. Thank you. The number of people out of work in the UK has fallen again. The jobless total is down 35,000 and now stands at 1.83 million people, the lowest figure for seven years. It means that 5.5% of the UK’s working population are out of work. Average wages excluding bonuses were up 2.2%. But the good news was tempered by a more pessimistic outlook from the Bank of England which cut its forecasts for economic growth, wages and productivity. Here’s our economics editor, Robert Peston. If you want to work in a butchers, a barbers or a beautician, Hounslow in West London is the place for you because demand for service sectorsjobs is booming. Nationally, there’s some of that too as unemployment drops to levels we haven’t seen since before the great crash. Pay is on average almost 2% higher across the whole UK, worth something with inflation having vanished. You have our reception... And locally there are hot spots. We’re beginning to notice shortage in the labour supply and shortage of jobseeker’s coming on to the market. What we’re finding in the last three months that we have had to increase our wage costs by 4-6% to maintain those people in the labour market. The UK’s recovery is continuing, but at a slower pace than the Bank of England forecast just three months ago. Then, it expected GDP, our national income, to rise 2.9% in 2015 and in 2016. Today, it revised that growth down to 2.5% this year and 2.6% next year. Part of the reason for the downgrade is that it’s gloomier about a long awaited revival of productivity or the output of workers per hour. Productivity is 17% below where it would have been if pre-crash trends had been sustained. That means that, in effect, we are 17% poorer. This year, the Bank of England expects productivity growth ofjust 0.25% negliable rising to a still low 1.25% next year. How worried should we be that you have downgraded your expectations for growth in productivity? It’s the nature ofjobs and it’s the nature of people filling jobs. Some of these jobs are lower productivity. Low skilled, low productivityjobs, and we have had a disproportionate number of those. That’s a cyclical phenomenon. That weighs on productivity and it’s detailed a bit in the report. The second thing is you get people who are new to jobs who are not productive as they are with time. So although it’s great that employment has risen to record levels, as the Governor says, many of the newjobs aren’t fantastically highly paid or high quality. And another thing, a tightening of the labour market means wage rises could refuel inflation and that means the long years of near zero interest rates may end injust under a year. The Prime Minister says a new counter-extremism bill will be in the Queen’s Speech later this month. The measures include banning orders against individuals and groups that promote extremist views which undermine British values. Tonight we have a special report on the man many believe prompted the Government’s action. Here’s our security correspondent Gordon Corera. Ina quiet In a quiet town in rural Norway a mother shows me around the park where she once took her son. Less than two months ago he received a phone call informing her that her son Tom had been killed fighting for the group calling itself Islamic State. She prefers not to show her face. How has his death affected you? When I got the message that he was dead, the blood just froze, my boy in this little town should go and become... Be dead there. The fate of Tom, seen here as a boy, is blamed by his mother on the group he became involved with after converting to Islam. Who do you think was responsible for him going out to Syria? I think personally... Here is Tom. One person involved with those who set up the group told us that when it was first established prophet ummah was disorganised and ineffective, that was it says until he was paid a visit by Choudray. He said he had a huge impact. The group’s spokesperson even told me he had recently been to Britain. I was there last year. I met Choudray and other brothers. To see them, learn from them, get advice? Learn and get advice and work with them. Nearly every individual who has gone from here in Norway to Iraq and Syria has been linked to the group Prophet Ummah which in turn has been supported by Choudray. It’s notjust Norway. Research seen by the BBC reveals that a third of those who have gone from western Europe are connected in some way to Chodray. The research is backed bun by his travels. For instance, to Belgium. I come from England to... Dozens from a group here linked to him have been prosecuted. Here in the heart of Europe... Here necessary Holland where he has had contact with another group and he is seen here in Denmark. I know many of you have friends who... Here in Britain he is on bail but has not been charged. He is perhaps though the person the Government had in mind when today it announced new measures to combat extremism. In London, he told me that while he had links to 40 groups in different countries, they were not run by him and he did not send people to fight. I don’t think that there is one example of anyone in Iraq or Afghanistan or Syria or any place in the world whether passed away or said I am here because I asked him to go abroad. Norway’s experience shows that his influence may extend far and wide across Europe. And many countries are trying to work out how to deal with it. Our home editor Mark Easton is here. We have seen the influence he has had and it shows how difficult tackling extremism will be. Against a background of hundreds heading off to fight and with people like him whose rhetoric is encouraging them to go the Government is convinced action needs to be taken. The proposal is for a new sort of ASBO-type banning order against groups or individuals deemed to be extremist. What is extremism? The Government’s definition is vocal or active opposition to fundamental British values, including democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty, mutual respect, and tolerance of different faiths and beliefs. But this is where it really starts to get difficult. As you say, it’s one thing to ban someone for inciting hatred or violence, but quite another to pass a law that silences anyone who challenges established values. I was in Parliament Square today, a statue of Gandhi looking down at me, who was jailed for being extremist. Mandela, jailed for being an extremist. History tells us that extreme views are sometimes needed to challenge the very established values that people at the time hold so dear. Thank you. The Royal Navy has rescued hundreds of people trying to cross the Mediterranean. HMS Bulwark was sent to help more than 400 people - including pregnant women and children - sailing from Libya to Europe in small inflatable dinghies. It comes as the European Commission has proposed a scheme to offer 20,000 refugees the right to resettle in countries across the EU, a measure Britain has opposed. The tour operator, Thomas Cook, ""breached their duty of care"", according to the jury at an inquest into the deaths of two young children in Corfu in 2006. Bobby and Christi Shepherd, who were aged six and seven, died of carbon monoxide poisoning from a faulty boiler while they were on holiday. The jury today delivered a verdict of unlawful killing. Danny Savage reports. A little brother with his big sister, excited to be on holiday, but a faulty boiler in a Greek hotel, spewing out poisonous fumes, killed Bobby and Christi Shepherd. Nearly nine years on, a coroner’s court concluded they were unlawfully killed. Their parents blame the holiday company. Thomas Cook could and should have identified that lethal boiler. Thomas Cook put Christi and Bobby in that bungalow and I will always hold Thomas Cook responsible for their deaths. It was in this bungalow that Bobby and Christi, their father Neil and his partner Ruth, started feeling sick one evening. The following day a maid found the children dead and the adults ina coma. This decrepit boiler, adjoining their rooms, was producing lethal amounts of carbon monoxide. The hotel manager, and two of his staff, were later found guilty of manslaughter. Two Thomas Cook holiday reps were cleared, but the family lawyer had this message today for the tour operator. Thomas Cook should hang its head in shame as a result of these deaths. You take money from families like this family, who expect to go on holiday and have the time of their lives. They don’t expect to return from holiday with their children in coffins. Thomas Cook emphasise they were cleared of any wrong-doing in the Greek courts, but the coroner here says he’s now going to make a number of recommendations to holiday companies after what he heard during this inquest, and more legal action could follow from the parents of these children depending on what the coroner says. Danny Savage, BBC News, Wakefield. In Nepal, hundreds of thousands of people have spent another night out in the open after the second major earthquake in less than three weeks. 76 people are known to have died yesterday, but that figure is expected to rise. The latest earthquake centered on several districts in the foothills of the Himalayas. The town of Chautara, where several people have been killed, was already a hub for rescuers and for aid after the first earthquake. Our South Asia correspondent, justin Rowlatt, is there. just when Nepal was beginning to get back to normal, another huge earthquake has reminded this countryjust how vulnerable it is. You see a lot of shaved heads here in Nepal, like the white clothes, they’re symbols of mourning. The Bister family lost their home and their grandmother in the first earthquake. Yesterday, they lost her son, Arjen, a husband, and a father. TRANSLATION: He was very hard-working. He WGSHe WGS S good TTIGI1. Belli Bister had been married to Arjen for 22 years. TRANSLATION: My world has been destroyed. I’m like a house without a foundation. I don’t think I’ll everfeel safe again. This place was badly damaged by the first earthquake, it’s been completely wrecked now. Arjen Bister was one of nine people who died here in the town of Chautara yesterday. He’d come in on his motorbike to collect some earthquake relief for his family - a tent, some food. There was no delay getting aid here, no shortage of willing hands to help. A fleet of helicopters brought the injured in to Kathmandu. But what no-one can help with is the fear. The fear that you’re not safe, that another quake will strike, because the scientists say there will be more earthquakes here. justin Rowlatt, BBC News, Chautara. Two more senior Labour figures have announced they are planning to stand for the party leadership. Shadow Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, has added her name to the list of those wishing to replace Ed Miliband, as has the Shadow Health Secretary, Andy Burnham. Labour wins when it speaks for everyone and for the whole country, for Middle England, but also for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland too. It comes after the Labour party announced today that it will spend the next four months electing a new leader and deputy leader. Our political correspondent, Carole Walker, joins us from Westminster. An attempted military coup is underway in Burundi. There has been heavy gunfire in the capital, Bujumbura, and at least 50,000 civilians have fled the small landlocked country. The East African nation was affected by the overspill of the Rwandan genocide in 1994, but also had it’s own civil war in which more than 300,000 thousand people were killed. Since then it has had a decade of relative calm, but the latest protests were sparked by the President’s decision to seek a third term in office. It triggered both violence and international condemnation. Maud julien is in the capital, Bujumbura, her report contains some images you may find distressing. The moment they’d been waiting for. Thousands of people marched to Bujumbura city centre alongside the army. Moments after a general announced he’d taken power. Weeks of demonstrations, these protesters believe, had paid off. TRANSLATION: It’s the people’s victory. We fought and were shot at. We didn’t eat. But in the end, victory is ours. The police tried to stop the movement. There were scenes of chaos. A senior army official has just announced that he no longer recognises the authority of the President and thousands are already celebrating on the streets, heading to the city centre. Meanwhile, there are clashes between the police and the army. GUNFIRE. That’s the gunfire you can hear. At least two died today. 18 have been killed in the protests so far. The whole country, around 90%, is secure. We have peace and security from Bujumbura when you go up country, you see that. So there is no doubt that we can organise successful elections in the country. In this protest the crowd turned against the police, who’d been trying to stop them, dragging a police woman through the streets. She was eventually rescued by colleagues, but the anger had reached boiling point. But whatever happens in Burundi, this is a development that will send a strong message to other African leaders that may be tempted to cling to power against the will of their people. Maudjulien, BBC News, Bujumbura. The TV presenter, Claudia Winkleman, has spoken for the first time about the night her eight-year-old daughter’s Halloween costume caught fire. She sustained serious burns and spent weeks in hospital. Claudia Winkleman decided to tell her story to the BBC’s Watchdog programme to warn parents of the dangers of cheap dressing-up clothes. I bought her costume from the supermarket. She wanted to go as a witch. So she had a witch’s hat and a cape, and I was talking to somebody and then Ijust heard her scream, and she just screamed ""mummy"", and I turned round and that was that. She was just on fire. I mean, she was on fire. Welcome to Strictly Come Dancing and of course a big welcome back to Claudia. Thank you. When Claudia Winkleman returned to Strictly Come Dancing last year, it was known her daughter had been seriously injured, but she said nothing publicly about the event, until now. She decided to talk to the BBC’s Watchdog programme because of what happened when a £5 supermarket costume brushed against a candle. It was just screaming. EVâI’yoIâ1â WGS SCI’â3TT’IiIâ1g. She was screaming. All the kids there were screaming. It feels like she was on fire for hours, but the surgeon said that definitely wasn’t the case and it was probably just seconds, but she went up. It’s the only way I know how to describe it. It’s not like fire I’d seen before. So we were manically, me and this other lovely dad, called jamie, were just patting and patting her. It was like in front of our eyes. It was like those horrific birthday candles that you blow out and then they come back. We couldn’t put her out. Matilda suffered massive injuries and has had many operations, but Claudia now realises she’s far from alone. Children’s nightwear has to meet strict standards of fire resistance, COStUITIâS, less So. They’re treated as toys when it comes to fire safety. The surgeon who treated Matilda wants that changed. I am in no doubt that legislation should be put in place to make sure that these fancy dresses are actually taken to the same extreme that night clothing is. She’s running and jumping and skipping about, but I think any parent, and goodness knows people go through so much worse, it makes you an anxious person. It’s definitely life-changing for me. I can’t remember life before it. I wish I had been dressed as the witch, is mainly all I wish, that it had happened to me. You can see all of Watchdog’s interview with Claudia Winkleman tomorrow night on BBC One at 8.00pm. Newsnight is on BBC Two. Here on BBC One, it’s time for the news where you are. Good evening. Tonight on BBC London: The father who fought to the get his daughter back from foster careers, only to Kyle her weeks later. An investigation into why Wheatley was ever given custody has begun. Also tonight: The recording of a police officer made by himself allegedly planning to hide an assault on a student. There are Ti’1âI’â BFE TTIOVES National Park city. Is that a crazy idea or will it make life better for all of us? Good evening. I’m Asad Ahmad. A father has been found guilty of murdering his four-year-old daughter at their house in Hatfield just months after winning custody of her. The court heard how Carl Wheatley had fought to get her from foster parents so he could claim more benefits and get a better home. Alexa-Marie’s body was so badly bruised by the beatings that the forensic pathologist who carried out the postmortem examination said he’d never seen injuries like it. Here’s Yvonne Hall. Cradled in her father’s arms, four-year-old Axexa-Marie, in public an image of loving care but in private, Wheatley was beating his daughter so badly she suffered internal injuries, the force of her blows blocked her lungs. They were hor ownedous injuries, very distressing for -- hor ownedous injuries, very distressing for -- horrendous injuries. Very distressing for us to deal with. injuries. Very distressing for us to dealwith. It deal with. It beggars belief how anyone would cause that or inflict that level of injuries on a child of that age. The tragic story began when she wasjust that age. The tragic story began when she was just two years old. Her mother couldn’t look after her and she was in foster care until her father won a custody battle, part Aliona to get more benefits and better housing. -- Aliona to get more benefits and better housing. -- partly to get more benefits and better housing. He began beating his daughter after she came to live here. The court was told on one occasion he hit her so hard he knocked her tooth out and then went on the internet to find out how to stick it back in and how to treat serious head injuries and bruising. Her injuries were so bad he hid her away here from public view and lied to social workers and teachers and three months after she came to live here she was dead. Her body covered in 68 bruises and cuts. Wheatley, a supermarket worker, denied murder but admitted manslaughter on the grounds of an attention deficit disorder but the prosecution said it was notjust attention deficit disorder but the prosecution said it was not just a sudden loss of temper, it was sustained, persistent, hard-hitting. He got angry if he didn’t get his own way and it’s my belief that he took out that anger on his four-year-old daughter. The jury agreed and returned a unanimous guilty verdict. Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire social services are now holding a Serious Case Review to find out why Wheatley was given custody and whether or not he was properly supervised once Alexa-Marie was living with him. The findings are expected to be made public by the end of the year. A mother and her twin daughters have been found dead at a house in East London. Police discovered the bodies of Shigi Rethishkumar and her twin daughters Niya and Neha in Chad well Heath yesterday afternoon. Theirfather, Rethishkumarwas found hanging in Walthamstow. The police watchdog, the IPCC, is now investigating as officers were first called to the address the day before the bodies were discovered. Blowing up cash machines on the high street using flammable gas is the new tactic being used by criminals in London. This is how it’s been done in Holland before the idea was imported here. Last year, there was a 2,000% rise in explosions like this, with industry insiders warning that it’s not only costing them millions, but it could also end up costing lives. A recording of a police officer allegedly trying to concoct a story after knocking out the tooth of a protester in Parliament Square has been played in court. PC Andrew Ott was taped on his own personal recording device threatening violence towards a crowd five years ago. Piers Hopkirk reports from South Warwick Crown Court. December 9th 2010, thousands took to the streets of the capital in a mass protest about student tuition fees. By the early evening, a large group of protesters had been contained near Parliament Square. The prosecution alleges that PC Andrew Ott, from Rochester, seen here arriving at court today, deliberately assaulted student William Horner as he ran from the cordon, knocking out one of his teeth with his riot shield. Then concocted a story with colleagues to try and justify his use of force. Today, the jury was played an audio recording of the entire incident made on a device worn by PC Ott. PC Ott can be heard saying, ""I’m up for this now, the Red Bull has kicked in."" Moments later, the scuffle with Mr Horner is recorded. Mr Horner can be heard saying, ""look at what you did, you broke my tooth. You’re a bully. I demand your number."" In an exchange after the incident, one officer is heard to say to PC Ott, about William Horner, ""he has not done anything, he jumped over the fence."" ",,

PC Calvin Lindsay and PC Thomas Barnes both deny The case continues. Harold Wilson once said, ""a week is a long time in politics"" and so it’s been for the Labour Party. Seven days ago the party faithful were all hailing Ed Miliband would be the next Prime Minister. A week on, he’s resigned, the jostling’s started for his job, Tooting MP Sadiq Khan is the latest to declare his interest and he’s been speaking to Karl Mercer. This is where it all started? This is where I grew up in. I was born and raised in Henry Prince estate... Expect to hear more of this in the weeks, the working class boy done goodis weeks, the working class boy done good is a message he hopes will see him to City Hall. The first thing is to do my best, you can take part in the selection by becoming a supporter. Once I have become the candidate we will see about the offer we make to London, I will send out policies. I will remind all Labour Party supporters, all of those standing to be Labour’s candidate that there have been four mayoral elections and only in one of them has the Labour candidate won. Labour Party, 25,263. This was Khan five days ago getting re-elected as MP for Tooting. Less than a week on he has confirmed he wants to be Labour’s candidate for mayor. You knew before the election that you wanted to stand for mayor, it’s not a decision you made in the last seven days, is it? Being Mayor of London for Londoner like me is a dream job. London for Londoner like me is a dreamjob. I get London for Londoner like me is a dream job. I get excited thinking about it, the hairs on the back of mY about it, the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. All my energies were focussed. .. my neck stand up. All my energies were focussed... You knew before the election, did you? All my energies were focussed on getting a Labour Government returned. That didn’t happen but Khan masterminded the Labour campaign that saw them gain seven seats in the capital. He will hope that will count in his favour against his rivals. David Lammey is running, Tessa jowell is likely to declare. As is Diane Abbott. The challenge in London is to get people in the outer London boroughs to vote Labour, that’s where Ken fell down last time. I was brought up in Harrow, I believe I am the one to appeal to the inner city and suburbia. I don’t think you have ever heard you describe yourself as Miss suburbia. Labour has agreed to put back mayoral election dates. We will know who the candidate is in the second week of September. Should London be turned into a National Park? Yeah, I thought it was a joke too when I first heard it, but the idea has been seriously suggested by someone who believes it will make the city a better place for us all to live. How would something like that work? Tom Edwards has been finding out. For its size it’s one of the greenest cities in the world, including parks, gardens, Commons and nature reserves, nearly half of the capital is green space. Now a campaign wants to make London a National Park city, to emphasise those open spaces. National Park are special places where people care more for nature and enjoy nature more, making ita more for nature and enjoy nature more, making it a National Park city I think will inspire people to think about how they can care and enjoy nature more, as well, whether you are a child planting a wild flower in the garden or an architect designing a new housing estate and thinking about how you can make it truly green and affordable. It’s an idea we can take inspiration from. There are 15 National Parks in the UK. All are rural like There are 15 National Parks in the UK. Allare rural like here in the Lake District. They conserve natural beauty and wildlife and heritage. Those parks have control over planning which wouldn’t happen here in the capital. And this has been welcomed in some quarters. The greens on the London Assembly say it has the potential to galvanise ideas which try and improve the environment in London. I know that it sounds like a bonkers idea, but I asked a few people and they said it’s brilliant, clearly by making London a National Park city it could improve health, increase biodiversity improve health, increase biodiversity and the quality of wildlife. This is early days in the campaign but it’s high hopes that by becoming a National Park the capital’s green spaces will get the recognition and further protection they deserve. A reminderthere in they deserve. A reminder there in that report of what a beautiful day it’s been. You have umbrellas behind you. Sadly, so. The news I was fearing to talk about, wet and colder tomorrow. Clearer skies further north. That translates to brightness first thing. It will be a dry commute for many, that’s an important message but don’t be caught out by that, from mid-morning here comes the rain. Some places will get an inch or so of rain. Some places really need it. Temperatures ten to 13 will cover it. It will feel raw given we have a strong Easterly, as well. Once you keep the rain for many it will set in for the greater part of the day. Tending to fizzle away through the evening as we bring in this high pressure settling things down nicely. What a contrast. Don’t dismiss the prospects of seeing the sun again, it will be become on Friday. After a cloudy start on Saturday I suspect we are going to see something fairly dry for the greater part of of the weekend. Here is the national picture for you. Good evening. Sunglasses today, umbrellas tomorrow. Don’t leave home without one. Here we will see a dramatic change in the weather in the south, it’s going to turn wet. Further north we will have a lovely sunny day. The dividing line is still a little bit uncertain as we will see. The rain will come with this band of cloud which is moving in off the Atlantic. Eventually later tonight it will bring some rain to the far south-west. Elsewhere, a dry start to the night. Areas of cloud further north but they’ll tend to thin out. With those clear skies across the Glens of Scotland and parts of northern England and eastern Counties temperatures close to or below freezing. Gardeners take note. Further south and west it will be milder, yes, but the catch is it will be a very wet start to the day across the south-west of England and South Wales. A lot of surface water and spray on the motorway network. Commuters take note of that. It could well be a dry, bright start across the London area. This rain slowly pushing in. By lunchtime it will be turning wet and once it starts raining it probably won’t stop. Somewhere within this zone temperatures will struggle to be higher than seven or eight through the afternoon. In complete contrast, at the other end it will be a glor yaus day. -- at the other end it will be a glor yaus day. -- glorious day. Now the dividing line, somewhere we think across North Wales, maybe the north Midlands, but that could well shift. Watch this space. It might brighten UP Watch this space. It might brighten up across the south-west of England for a time in the afternoon. That will help temperatures here. Through tomorrow evening it will stay damp across southern Counties, gradually that rain will ease away. Under clearing skies tomorrow night a frost again across some northern areas. But it means a bright crisp start to Friday for a few of us and it will be a much better day across south-east areas. Generally it will cloud over from the west on Friday with rain turning up across parts of Northern Ireland and western Scotland on a freshening breeze. That rain is coming with this weather front here. It will be weak. A few early showers across the south-east from that front but things will brighten up and for many of us on Saturday it will be bright and breezy, though there will be some sharp showers across the north-west. On Sunday more cloud and that cloud thickening, particularly across Northern OXYGEN MASK RASPS # I can feel the world is watching # I want you with me... # Wherever you are, they know you’re there, this summer on BBC Sport.

At least 36 people are dead and over1,000 injured, as a 7.3 tremor strikes east of the capital Kathmandu. Powerful tremors rock the country’s parliament and politicians are forced to flee to safety outside. This footage filmed by the Canadian Red Cross shows the moment the quake triggered a landslide in the Himalayas. We’ll be bringing you the latest on this new crisis to hit Nepal. Also this lunchtime: David Cameron tells his first all-Conservative Cabinet they are the "" real party of working people"". Rail workers vote to go on strike over pay and job security. A big rise in younger people suffering strokes, obesity and lazy lifestyles are blamed. And ""no trust"" in Kevin Pietersen, he won’t be back in the Test team, despite his triple century. Let’s not run away from the fact, thatis Let’s not run away from the fact, that is the issue, that is the problem and that is the one we need to address if there is any future for Kevin in English cricket. At the moment, we are miles apart. Later on BBC London: A first look at the plans for the gardens designed for the capital’s controversial new river crossing. Will the sun stick around? And Kate will have the full forecast. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. A second powerful earthquake has hit Nepal. The tremor happened in a remote part of the country, so reports are still sketchy, but so far at least 36 people are known to have died, and over1,000 injured. Today’s tremor struckjust west of Namche Bazar, close to Mount Everest. Last month, 8,000 people died when a more powerful tremor hit the country. We’ll be live in Nepal injust a moment, first our World Affairs correspondent, Paul Adams, with the latest on this morning’s new earthquake. Kathmandu, this morning, a city familiar with after-shocks but he sensed that this is something different, people pouring into the streets, wondering if their homes are safe. This was not a repeat of last month was a massive earthquake, but it was big enough to stir the deepest fears. I’m trying to call to mY deepest fears. I’m trying to call to my home. But it is busy. I’m worried for my family. ~ I think it is a really big hit of an earthquake. This has flaunted. Boulders are moving, they might fall again. Nepal’s parliament was in session when the earth started to move, a camera capturing the quake’s rapid crescendo. After a moment of uncertainty, MPs scramble for the exits. People need to get outside right away. Cars were shaking and the buildings were swaying. One of the most shocking things was how long the earthquake went on for. Critically for our Nepalese staff here it was very traumatic -- Nepalese staff here it was very traumatic -- particularly. A lot of them have families and friends living in buildings that may have been damaged in the first earthquake. Some survivors of that quake found themselves evacuated for a second time, fresh trauma for people who have already experienced far too much. Today’s quake was felt as far afield as Delhi and Dakar. But the epicentre was east of Kathmandu, close to Everest. This video from the Canadian Red Cross shows a terrifying avalanche, north of the capital. The latest pictures on Nepalese TV: Rescue workers digging in fresh piles of rubble, one of the world’s poorest countries now grappling with yet more misery. We can speak to Simon Cox in Kathmandu and who experienced the tremor while he was there. It was a very dramatic experience for anyone who was here. When the moment the quake struck, 7.3 on the Richter scale it was very strange. I was in a building under a variety that immediately the Nepalese people pulled me outside. -- that immediately the Nepalese people pulled me outside. -- under a Veranda. We waited whilst the tremor went on for about 25-30 seconds. The building next to us was shaking. There were birds squawking around us. There was a lot of fear and anxiety but not panic. Thank you. Simon Cox. The BBC’s Yogita Limaye is travelling with earthquake, Baluwa, west of Kathmandu. She described what happened to her. I am in a valley. I was en route to the epicentre of the earthquake that occurred on the 25th of April, when we felt that big earthquake today. It started shaking, all around us. From some of the mountains I could see dust flying off, stones coming down. What was striking about it, in the past two and a half weeks I felt several tremors but what was very striking about this one was how long it went on for. To point out the difficulty of even reaching there, we had to drive three hours on a bumpy road. And from here it is on foot for about five hours. If the new earthquake has caused more devastation, destruction and loss of life, the challenge for Nepal is just going to get extremely hard. There will be much more on that earthquake throughout the afternoon on the BBC News Channel. The first all-Conservative Cabinet meeting for 18 years took place in Downing Street this morning, with David Cameron telling his new team they were the "" real party of working people."" Downing Street said Mr Cameron spoke about the government delivering on ""bread and butter issues"" such as home ownership, and reforming education and welfare. Our Political Correspondent Eleanor Garnier reports. Is this the new face of the Conservative Party? Good morning and welcome. The son of a milkman, now community Secretary Greg Clark, state educated Business Secretary Sajid javid, whose dad was a bus driver and Priti Patel, whose parents are from Uganda is the new employment minister. It is what is being called blue-collar conservatism. I call that being the real party of working people, giving more and more working people the dignity of work, the dignity of having a paycheque, being able to keep more of their own money as they choose, a home of their own. The piece and mind of security of being able to raise a family and having a decent and secure retirement. The focus will be fast tracking new laws and the Prime Minister wants to lower the maximum amount that a household and claiming benefits each year from £26,000, to £23,000. The families of three and four-year-olds in England will be given double the amount of free childcare they are currently entitled to, a rise from 15, 230 hours a week. It currently entitled to, a rise from 15,230 hours a week. It might not have been a major reshuffle, but with this new cabinet, David Cameron is trying to portray a new image, one that challenges the Conservatives as elitist and the party of the affluent and rebrand it as the party forwarding people. Already, the pressure is on. With the prospect of tougher rules on strike ballots, the trades union Congress claimed the government is not so much on the side of hard-working people, but Britain’s worst bosses. Our voters in Morley, where Labour’s Ed Balls lost out to the Tories, feeling optimistic? Nothing seems to change. We go to work and we don’t get any richer. You are hoping, you put your trust in them but whether that comes to fruition is another thing. I have seen it myself, people getting jobs and improving themselves. For now, it is smiles all round. Remember, it’s early days in this brand-new all Conservative government. Let’s speak to our Assistant Political Editor, Norman Smith. What does that tell us about the new government’s priorities? It tells us about the story Mr Cameron wants to define his second term in government, which is centred on this phrase blue-collar conservatism. If you haven’t heard it before, you will hear it again and again in the months and years to come. It means trying to focus on bread-and-butter issues that actually matter to ordinary folk. Issues like pay, jobs, owning your own home, childcare. Significantly today Mr Cameron flagged up two policies which are to be fast tracked in his Queen ‘s speech. One will create around 3 million new apprenticeships. The other is another crackdown on benefits, reducing the amount you can claiming benefits from £26,000 per year to £23,000 per year. That is meant to say this: If you want to get on and you want to get a job, the government will help you. If you want to remain on benefits, things will get sticky. The point is not merely to just recast the image of the Tories, to wrong-foot the Labour Party, who traditionally see themselves as the party of working people, it is born of necessity in part. This will be a government which will face a lot of very inch get constitutional issues. What we do about English votes, Scotland, the Human Rights Act. Distant issues from ordinary people. He wants to insure his cabinet remained grounded and focused on issues that matter to real people. Thanks. The Shadow Business Secretary, Chuka Umunna, has confirmed he’s going to stand for the Labour leadership. He made the announcement in a video on his Facebook page, saying Labour under Ed Miliband had failed to appeal to enough voters in England. He’s the second candidate to put his name forward, following Liz Kendall, the Shadow Care minister. Here’s our Political Correspondent, Iain Watson. Labour isa Labour is a long way from the heady days of big election victories, the boom and bust and frankly being fashionable. Ed Miliband said he wanted to move beyond new Labour but some say the next debt is back to the future. Building on and not demolishing Tony Blair’s legacy. Chuka Umunna says labour should be the party of aspiration and he aspires to be its next leader. To emphasise that he is the Next Generation, not the one lost in 2010, you announced his candidacy not on television but on Facebook. -- he announced. I am not on television but on Facebook. -- he announced. Iam pleased -- he announced. I am pleased to announce I will be standing for the leadership of the party. I think we can and should be winning in seats like in Swindon. North South East West, we can do it as a party. You backed Ed Miliband for Labour leadership, what did he and you get wrong? It was a collective failure on the part of the France team, so to speak. The result last week. -- front team. Going forward, we need to be clear that we want to help to address the security, the insecurities, if you like, but also the aspirations of people all the way up the income chain. Labour failed to regain either seat in Swindon, constituencies which they had won under Tony Blair in 1997. Swindon North was Labour until 2010. But this time round the Conservative candidate got half of all votes cast. Doing even better then at the last general election. That is the Shadow Business Secretary the right person to win back Labour’s lost legion of voters? We are asking people in Swindon if they recognise this man? No, I don’t. That’s the labour bloke, isn’t it? Do you know his name? Chuka somebody? The possible leader of the Labour Party? That is the Labour guy. What is good about him? Does he come across better? He has good answers. Rebuilding the majority of Labour from a low base will be a hard task for the weather becomes the next Labour leader and Chuka Umunna is likely to face competition from the Shadow Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, Andy Burnham, the Shadow Health Secretary amongst others but all of them have a long road to travel if Labour is going to win in 2020. The Chancellor George Osborne has arrived in Brussels for talks with European finance ministers on the economic stability of EU member countries. The new Conservative government is committed to trying to renegotiate Britain’s relationship with the EU before holding an in-out referendum on membership. Our Political Correspondent, Alex Forsyth is in Brussels. Britain’s relationship with the European Union wasn’t on the formal agenda of George Osborne’s meeting this morning but no doubt it would have, over Coffey, during conversations on the sidelines. The Chancellor is the first senior member of the British governor to come to Brussels since the Conservatives won the election -- over some coffee. They promised to hold the election in 2017. They need to renegotiate terms of Britain’s membership. The Chancellor will play a key role but it will not be easy. He needs to come up with a package of measures which is accessed 22 EU leaders but also acts that will to Eurosceptic Tory backbenchers back home in the UK. Into the meeting the Chancellor sounded pretty determined. We come here with a clear mandate to improve Britain’s relationship with the rest of the EU. And to reform the EU. So that it createsjobs and EU. And to reform the EU. So that it creates jobs and increase createsjobs and increase of living standards for all of its citizens. I don’t think anybody is now in any doubt we will hold a referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union, having conducted these negotiations. We go into the negotiations aiming to be constructive and engaged, but also resolute and firm. And no one should underestimate our determination to succeed for the working people of Britain, indeed the working people of the whole of the European Union. One man who thinks perhaps the government will not succeed is Nigel Farage, back in Brussels today following the election. He was back as Ukip’s leader. On Friday he said as promised, he would quit thatjob after he failed to win a seat in Westminster but the party refused to accept his resignation. I spoke to him this morning and he told me he didn’t think taking back the job of Ukip leader dented his credibility because he had a vital role to play in his words, now those discussions over the EU referendum are underway. I was persuaded by the NEC. And by the candidates and the party at large that the best thing, not just for the party but also for the ongoing debate that is now happening about Europe, was for me to stay. It undermines your credibility as a man who keeps his word. I did keep my word. For three days! I said publicly I was going. I certainly had not expected it. I hadn’t expected the warmth of feeling. Quite frankly, the emotion that was expressed from that meeting. This is undoubtedly a crucial time when it comes to Britain’s relationship with Europe now the referendum is fixed firmly on the horizon. Be assured when you get any seen area figures here in Brussels, those meetings will take on a whole new significance. Network Rail workers have voted overwhelmingly in favour of going on strike in a row over pay. The union said it showed the anger of staff over what it called ""attacks on their standards of living and theirjob security"". Let’s speak to our Transport Correspondent, Richard Westcott, who’s at London’s Waterloo station. Could we be looking at big disruption over the next few weeks? We haven’t had a national rail strike for 20 years. What I would say is we are a step closer today. It is really significant that it is the RMT doing this. Why? It is 5,500 signallers they have as members. If you lose the signallers, you lose the railways. You cannot run a railway. You would be talking about chunky disruption if it happened. On the positive side for commuters anyway, my understanding is these two sides are not a million miles apart. They thought they had a deal a few weeks ago. That broke down. Here is a row over money a four-year Here is S I’oW oVâI’ TT’IOIâ1ây S foUI""yâ3I’ PGY Here is a row over money a four-year pay deal, but it is only a row over this year’s money and job security as well. I think there is a good chance these two sides will get together. The RMT have not called strikes yet, they don’t know what they are going to do and even if there are strikes threatened there could be a deal over the next few weeks. So not time to worry yet if you are a commuter. Interestingly the Government is calling for a change in the laws to make it harder to go on strike, a 50% turnout on ballot. 1+0% of everyone eligible to vote, not the people who do vote but everyone eligible, in this case with the RMT, the strike would have still gone ahead. The new laws would make it tougher to strike but in this case the strike would still have gone ahead. Thank you very much. A powerful new earthquake has hit Nepal. At least 32 people are known to have died and over 1,000 injured. And still to come: The return of El Nino - forecasters warn of a ""substantial weather event"". In the sport-- Kath reignia johnson Thomson will not compete in Austria this month. A recent knee injury has disrupted representation. -- her preparations This was the scene back in 2011, when they were team-mates in England’s winning Ashes team down under. But now England’s new director of cricket, Andrew Strauss, has confirmed there’ll be no place for Kevin Pietersen in this And that’s despite the Surrey batsman scoring his first-ever triple century in a match this week. Strauss spoek to us about his decision to our Sports Correspondent, joe Wilson, who’s at Lord’s. StI’SUSS BSSUFES TTIE Strauss assures me there is nothing personal in this decision not to bring Kevin Pietersen back. You may remember the his last days of his captaincy was filled with storives texts and the book last year, highly critical of colleagues. Basically, Pietersen has burned a lot of bridges, but as you said, today’s decision not based on runs, it was a question of trust. The a Lords, England’s new directedor, Andrew Strauss had come to set out his vision for cricket’s future, the past was behind him. Elsewhere in London, at the Oval Kevin Pietersen was resuming for Surrey on 326 not out, history was against him. On TV commentary, Strauss, accidentally when commentary, Strauss, accidentally when he had no idea when he was being broadcast used a word to describe Pietersen which would end mY describe Pietersen which would end my career if he repeats that. He regrets that but is adamant his former team-mate, regrets that but is adamant his formerteam-mate, is former team-mate, is not for England right now You can see there is no trust. Between Kevin and the board. Let’s not get away from the fact that that is the issue. That is the problem and that is what we need to address, if there is any future for Kevin in English cricket. At the moment we are miles apart. Everybody connected with cricket would agree that the English team needs some heroes, entertainers, people to bring in non-cricket fans. Why on earth would England use his star quality to generate attention on the team? Absolutely, I totally agree. I told you his capabilities as a batsman has never been in doubt. But if you have no trust, how do you start, how do you build a team environment? How do you build a team culture? Trust is the foundation for everything you do in any team environment. We don’t have that at the moment, we have got to be honest. Pietersen finished on 355, not out, at the Oval. He is apparently incredibly upset. He is an outstanding individual. Cricket remains, as it always has been, a team sport. No-one generates interest amongst cricketers than Kevin Pietersen, Michael Vaughn saying, why doesn’t England just pick the best players. I suppose they have the opportunity to show they can win without Pietersen. It will be the ash ashes later this summer, Rita and Andrew Strauss told me today he thinks England can beat Australia. Thank you very much. Doctors say there’s been an ""alarming"" rise in the number of strokes among men and women aged between 1+0 and 51+. The Stroke Association analysed national hospital admissions in England from 2000 to 2011+ and found that growing obesity levels, sedentary lives and unhealthy diets play a big part in explaining the rise. Here’s our Health Correspondent, Dominic Hughes. OpEIâ1 yoUI’ EYES. Squeeze my fingers. Last Monday, Tony O’Driscoll’s life changed forever. At the age ofjust 51+, he suffered a stroke that left him paralysed down one side. Swift treatment saved his life and now he’s making good progress. How are you on your feet? I couldn’t move my arm or my leg when I first came in. Each day I have had physio. I never thought it would happen to me. You always think it is someone older it is going to happen to. But as new figures reveal, that’s no longer necessarily the case. Traditionally we thought of stroke as something that happens to older people, but as Tony’s case illustrates, more and more younger people are now being affected. A new picture is emerging. Over the course of 15 years, hospital admissions in England for stroke among men aged 1+0 to 51+ increased by nearly 50%. It was a similar story for women in the same age group, where the figure was up by almost one-third. We think the main reason are changes in lifestyles, people having food with too much sugar and salt and fat and people moving around less and being less physically active than they need to be. Experts say the health service needs to think about how to treat this growing number of younger stroke patients. Certainly when we are designing our stroke services to future-proof them, these are the things we are looking at, support to get people back to work and doing more rehabilitation in people’s homes rather than hospital and getting people back to the life they had beforehand and not just being physically healthy. An increasing number of people having strokes in their 1+os and early 50s will carry a huge cost for patients and their families but the health and social care system as well. The American Secretary of State, john Kerry, is due to meet President Putin of Russia later this afternoon, with the situation in Ukraine top of their agenda. It’s the first time the US Secretary of State has been in Russia since the Ukraine crisis began 18 months ago. Our Diplomatic Correspondent, Bridget Kendall, is in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, where the meeting is taking place. The first time the US Secretary of State has set foot in Russia for two years at a time when US Russian relations are at their chilliest for decades. But this looks like an attempt to reach out. First stop - to acknowledge Russia’s role in World War II, a ceremony at Sochi’s war memorial with the Russian Foreign Minister. Wanted recognition of Russia’s part in the Second World War, even if the Americas, like other Western leaders, did shun the big military parade last Saturday in Moscow. This visit is highly significant given the low-ebb of the US Russian relations and the fact that john Kerry has agreed to come here, the Sochi to see President Putin, is also important, the Russians are seeing it as a gesture of respect, something they say they don’t get enough of from the Americans. Both sides say there is a broad agenda, in areas where the already cooperate. The ceasefire in eastern Ukraine is barely holding, and Nato this week has already complained of reports of more Russian hardware coming into the area. For his part, President Putin has a long list of grievances against the Americans, whom he accuses of provoking the conflict. At the victory parade last Saturday, Russia flaunted its military might and President Putin criticised the Americans for trying to dominate the world. But he also told Angela Merkel that he wants to normalise relations with the West. The Americans to our emphasising the positive. No promise of any dramatic breakthrough at these talks, but any hint of progress to break the ice in relations would be a real achievement. Sussex Police have been criticised for missing an opportunity in 2008 to investigate jimmy Savile, over an allegation of serious sexual assault. The Independent Police Complaints Commission says two officers who interviewed the alleged victim failed to EFICOUFBQE i’IEIâ to pUI’SUE ti’IE CBSE. Let’s speak to our Home Affairs Correspondent, june Kelly. Tell us more. A number of forces have been investigated over their failings in relation tojimmy Savile and this isjust failings in relation tojimmy Savile and this is just another example of how he was able to slip through the net N 2008 this woman went to the Sussex force and said that Savile had sexually assaulted her in a caravan in Worthing in 1970 and that afterwards she said he gave her a small wooden crucifix. Now this, report by the police watchdog said the woman showed considerable forward by coming forward but her complaint wasn’t dealt with properly. She said the officers tried to frighten her off. She said they said to her, ""He is a very powerful man, he will make mincemeat of you."" So the complaint didn’t actually proceed. Now, obviously this happened four years before the Savile scandal blew up and since then there has been a lot of soul-searching by police forces across the country N this case the Sussex force says it has changed its practises. -- in this case. A former detective, who was part of the team investigating the Bradford City Fire in 1985, has told the BBC that the police have always known the identity of the person who may have accidentally started the fire. A dropped cigarette was identified as the likely cause of the disaster which killed 56 people. Retired Detective Inspector Raymond Falconer was speaking on the 30th anniversary of the tragedy. Robert Hall reports. Remembrance and reflection, three decades on. This city has never forgotten those who died at Valley Parade, never stopped wondering what caused the tragedy. The official inquiry concluded a dropped cigarette butt had ignited rubbish under the stand and photos taken by an off-duty police officer appeared to pinpoint what might have happened. But who had been sitting there. By reconstructing the scenes, detectives isolated two men who were visiting from Australia. When they were finally tracked down, one of them confirmed the accident theory. He said that he had been at the match, he had been sat in the stand, right where we knew the seat of the fire had taken place. He said he smoked a cigarette, dropped the cigarette on to the floor in front of him, went to put his foot on it but it had unfortunately dropped through, he said a nuthole. That man was Eric Bennett, who has since died. Mr Bennett told officers that he had tried to put the fire out by pouring coffee on to it but within minutes, the smoke and flames had returned. So they rushed to the back of the stand and got hold of some policeman, told them what was happening. The policeman very quickly started to evacuate the stand but the rest, well, we know the tragic results of what happened. The truth is that he dropped a cigarette and he was quite unequivocal about it, he dropped the cigarette that started the fire. 30 years on, even with the benefit of those recollections from a former investigator, are we any closer to finding the answer? Perhaps the truth is that we’ll never be 100% certain as to who or what started the chain of events that ended in tragedy on that day in May. Viewers in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire can see more on that in 10.25pm. Viewers in the rest of the UK can see the documentary on BBC Two tomorrow. You are watching the BBC News at One: Our top story today - a powerful new earthquake has hit Nepal. At least 1+2 people are known to have died and over a thousand injured. In a moment, we will have the weather and the news where you are. First, the sport from the BBC Sports Centre. More news of Kevin Pietersen and the rest of the day’s sport. Let’s get more on Kevin Pietersen and his failed attempt to return to the England side. The ECB’s new director of cricket Andrew Strauss has confirmed this morning that Pietersen will not be recalled this summer and he says there is a massive trust issue and the return would not be in term interest of the team. He insists it is nothing personal. Kevin and I have never got nearly as badly as people have made out. We have had times when we have drifted apart for a number of reasons. I come into this role that there is only one thing I can do in this bowl of that is say what is in the best interest of English cricket. -- the best interest of English cricket. -- this role. It is not about me or Kevin, it is about English cricket going forward. Providing this clarity is the best way for us to move forward, both as an England cricket team and as an organisation. In their meeting last night Strauss also said Pietersen did not react well when he was told he would not be recalled at Pietersen was apparently offered an advisory role with the England one-day squad that he turned it down. Today Pietersen’s best innings came to an end when he was run out in Surrey’s County Championship match against Leicestershire finishing on 355 not out, just two runs short of the Surrey record. Our reporter was there. As storms range around him and other parts of London, Kevin Pietersen has enjoyed a pleasant morning in the Sunni surrounds of the Oval. -- a pleasant morning in the Sunni surrounds of the Oval. -- Sunshine surrounds. He called it the best of his career but it was not over. He turned up this morning and he made no comment about the meeting he had with Andrew Strauss, as we now know he has no place in England’s short-term rounds. He relaxed as he played football before the cricket. He even refereed. He thrives on pressure. He resumed on in no time he moved to 355, two runs short of Surrey’s all-time record. The man at the other end, Matt Dunne lost his wicked leading Pietersen agonisingly short. He got a rousing reception from the members in the pavilion behind me and one man even said Kevin, you are a genius. Surrey will try to bowl out Leicestershire this afternoon, no more batting for Pietersen, time perhaps, to think. Katarina johnson-Thompson habitat it has pulled out of a meeting this month, suffering a knee injury after winning gold in Prague this March. A match restricted training schedule and preparations. She competed in the 200 meter hurdles in Manchester last weekend, finishing second but she’s not ready to take on a heptathlon. The Aston Villa midfielderjack greenish has still not made up his mind whether to play international football for England or the Republic of Ireland. He was due to be named in Martin O’Neill’s squad for next month’s friendly against England but after speaking to him and his father, O’Neill has left him out. The New England Patriot star quarterback, Tom Brady, has been banned forfour games in his part in a scandal. The NFL concluded that the Super Bowl’s most valuable player was aware that footballs had been tampered with to make it easier for footballs had been tampered with to make it easierfor him to footballs had been tampered with to make it easier for him to throw and catch in a key play-off game. He plans to appeal. The Patriots were fined $1 million and stripped of two draft picks. It is about integrity. If someone is breaking rules, I understand that you need to get punished for it. Any time you lose a starting quarterback for four games and draft picks it is a big statement. Obviously, the NFL is serious about not messing with the integrity of the game, numbers -- serious about not messing with the integrity of the game, numbers -- no matter how big the issue is. Forecasters say the weather pattern known as El Nino has been forming during the spring and could cause what they’ve described as a ""substantial weather event"". It’s caused when the temperature of the Pacific rises, with a domino effect that can lead to droughts in some parts of the world and floods in others, as happened in 2009. jon Brain has more. It was labelled ""the big freeze."" The winter of 2010 hit the UK hard and the country shivered. Long periods of ice and heavy snow caused the inevitable chaos and disruption to transport. The severity was largely blamed on the El Nino effect and El Nino might be about to show its colours again. Since the start of this year we have seen temperatures in the Pacific warm up and now you can see the red colours, which shows the temperatures are above normal. Some parts of the Pacific are two degrees above normal. This is the beginning of an El Nino weather pattern. That overrides normal conditions. As the area of unusually warm water moves, so does an area of wet and unsettled weather, leading to changes in temperatures and rainfall around the world. For example, Peru and Ecuador are prone to flooding. In contrast, Australia is one of a number of countries that can be hit by drought. But El Nino is never the same twice. And experts say it is too early to know the impact it’ll have this time around. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Nick Miller. From the intricacies of global weather to our more familiar sunshine and showers. ~ I will talk about Frost. Although it looks lush, some parts of the UK are dry and may be about to get some proper rain, keep watching. This area of cloud gave a splash of rain this morning but it is gone.

A woman’s been taken to hospital after an advertising billboard fell on to her as she walked along a street in Tooting. The emergency services were called to the junction of Mitcham Road and Mellison Road this morning and police say the woman’s injuries are not life-threatening. Police say they are now treating the death of a woman who’s body was discovered in a suitcase in the Grand Union Canal as murder. Detectives are continuing house-to-house inquiries and looking through CCTV. The body was found on Sunday afternoon near Maida Vale. Police believe they know the identity of the woman, but she hasn’t been formally identified. The online retailer Amazon has announced it will create hundreds of newjobs in Dunstable.

We got more details today of how the controversial Garden Bridge will look as the design for its gardens was revealed. The Bridge will span the Thames between Temple and the South Bank. Critics say it’s in the wrong place, but the designers say it’ll be inspirational. Here’s our Transport Correspondent Tom Edwards. In the Thames, river surveys have started to see what the Garden Bridge will be built on. Today, more progress, plans revealing the gardens. This image shows what they will look like with marshland, woodland and ornamental gardens.

For it to be somewhere that really is unique, something that we can be proud of as a nation, right in the very heart of our city. The bridge will cost £170 million. £125 million has already been pledged, including £30 million each from the Treasury and Transport for London. The Garden Bridge trust has said it has listened to those who have concerns about this project. There will be 300 trees, now, on the bridge. The views will not be as badly obscured ",,

Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. Another powerful earthquake has struck Nepal killing dozens and injuring over 1,000 people. Killing at least A1 people. In Kathmandu, the quake sent residents fleeing onto the streets and in remote areas communities were cut off by landslides. Today’s quake came less than three weeks after the earthquake that killed at least 8,000 people. It struck north east of Katmandu, close to Mount Everest and registered a magnitude of 7.3, that’s slightly smaller than the previous disaster which was 7.8. From Nepal, Yogita Limaye sent this report. Their worst fears came true. Nepal was struck a second time. People who were already on edge with scores of tremors since the first earthquake last month poured into Kathmandu’s streets as the earth began to shake again. I’m trying to call to my home. But it is busy. I am worried for my family. I think it is a really big hit of an earthquake. This is slanted. Everything is moving, they might fall again. Hospital patients were taken outside and laid on the pavement for their own safety. Nepal’s Parliament was in session. Disaster relief has been top priority for ministers and politicians here. But before they knew it, they were caught in the middle of another one. This time, the epicentre was in the east of the country, close to Mount Everest. This time the quake triggered an avalanche, caught on camera by the Canadian Red Cross, north of Kathmandu. Some survivors of the earlier earthquake had to be rescued again. Those who had been injured had to be carried to safety. More trauma, before their scars had healed. People knew to get outside right away. Cars were shaking, the buildings were swaying. One of the most shocking things was how long the earthquake went on for. Today’s earthquake has also taken lives. This small village near the Chinese border, at least four people have died here. The area had already been badly hit by the disaster, last month. This fresh earthquake struck Nepal at a time when people hadn’t even begun to think about recovering from the devastation that the first one left behind. This is a remote village in Nepal, very hard to access. So many homes have been destroyed here and so far they have been left just as they are. The families who live in them have been in tents and temporary shelters for more than two weeks now. Fear continues to haunt the people of one of the poorest countries in the world. Paul Adams is with me, terrible for the people of Nepal, how much of a setback will this be? Particularly after relative calm. As people look at that the new cracks at the buildings in Kathmandu, they will wonder about whether it is safe to go indoors, more tents and time outside and food and water relief supplies. Silver lining, the country is awash with relief teams. If there are people to be rescued, there are plenty of people there, to rescue them. That is one thing to raise spirits. On the other side, you have the UN warning that it has only raised around 13% of the $1+23 million it says is needed in the initial phases of Nepal’s recovery. Other aid agencies are warning that donors are already getting weary. Particularly in remote communities. We saw that landslide at Dunche. There have been landslides in those remote mountainous areas where the worst damage was done. People are taking belief in donkeys and using tractors, that will become harder. One last element, what they call the mental quake. People are spending a lot of time reassuring children in Nepal that theirfears lot of time reassuring children in Nepal that their fears are no longer necessary. Although that what is an done, which means people have to stay longer, spend more time on the ground and that costs money. Thank you. The first all-Conservative Cabinet for 18 years met at Downing Street today. The Prime Minister, David Cameron, said his new government would focus on ""bread and butter"" ways of improving people’s lives. He’s been completing his reshuffle with a host of ministerial appointments. Our deputy political editor james Landale, has more details. To the victors, the smiles, this is the first fully Conservative cabinet in almost two decades. Many faces may be familiar, but today the cameras were allowed in, to show there are now a few more women around the table, some more ministers from modest backgrounds. The message was clear, this cabinet may be led by in old Etonian, that he is promising to govern for ordinary people. Some pundits might call this blue-collar conservatism or being on the side of hard-working taxpayers. I would call that being the real party of working people. Giving more and more people the dignity of work. He and they are going to spend much of the next five years cutting spending and arguing about Europe and the union. But today he tries to set a different agenda, promising compassion, social justice and... The down-to-earth bread-and-butter issues that we were elected to deliver on. That is what we have to do in this Parliament. The body Madonna blue-collar conservativism is Robert Halfon, the new Tory deputy chairmen, a campaigning MP from Harlow in exes. We would get his constituency to find workers to see what they thought of the Tories. They promised to cut the amount families can claiming benefits from £26,000, £223,000 a year to pay for printer ships. To give working parents three to four-year-olds more childcare. There is also a promise to make it harder for workers to go on strike -- to £23,000 a week. Do you think David Cameron understands working class people? Nope. Ido think he has personally been there. He has been fed with a spoon since he was little. Working class have had to work their way up, earn a living to PGY work their way up, earn a living to pay our bills and pay for everything. Do you think the Tories or any politicians can represent working people? I don’t think so, they never get their hands dirty. Do the Tories represent working people? As long as they stay true to their word and do what they’ve promised, they could do. Even in Harlow, where the Tories increased their majority, the party may find it takes time to change their image. David Cameron has onlyjust been returned to office and is already thinking about the next election. He once the Conservatives to try to shed their image as a party of the rich by appealing to blue-collar workers in places like Harlow and elsewhere. People who, in the past, have voted Labour and People who, in the past, have voted Labourand Ukip. Labour’s People who, in the past, have voted Labour and Ukip. Labour’s newly elected MPs are still looking for a leader. Today another his hat into the ring. But he wants the party to appeal to the middle classes, not just its traditional supporters. We need to talk to people’s desire to get on and do well, their aspirations. By the way, it is often talked about in terms of... Middle England, so to speak. I think that aspiration goes all the way down the salary spectrum. In Essex and elsewhere, the battle for voters hearts and minds is on. Five years before the next election. Thousands of Network Rail workers have voted to go on strike over pay and conditions. Members of the RMT union voted by 1+-1 to walk out, on a turnout of 60%. The union said the result reflected the anger of staff at attacks on their living standards and job security. The government condemned any action that would disrupt the travelling public. Our transport correspondent, Richard Westcott, is London’s Waterloo station. Do we know when the strike will place and how disruptive it could be? The key questions for these people behind me are those. When it might happen? We are still waiting to hear what the RMT plan to do. In the next day or two they could named strike dates, there is a bank holiday coming up, they might aim at that. -- they could name. In terms of level of destruction, this is the RMT. They cover all of the people who work the signals. Without signals, our railway network, the whole thing, freezes up. Places like this would have no trains coming in or out. It could potentially cause massive disruption. Having said all of that, I understand there is still half decent chances that these two sides will be able to thrash out a deal. They are both still willing to talk. They are not so far part in what they want that there is definitely going to be a strike no matter what. definitely going to be a strike no matterwhat. It matter what. It is not inevitable. You heard in our report that there was new, rules, they will make it tougher to go on strike. -- was new, rules, they will make it tougher to go on strike. -- new government. Even if they applied that new law, it would still go ahead because enough people voted. Thank you. The number of men and women in their 1+os and 50s suffering strokes has soared in recent years, according to a medical charity. The Stroke Association described the findings as ""alarming"" and blamed obesity and sedentary lifestyles. Our Health Correspondent Dominic Hughes has been to meet one stroke survivor, john Mcllroy, in St Helens. john, yourfood is ready. Cheers, love. john Mcllroy is a very lucky man. One day after work years ago, he suffered a devastating stroke, which changed his life for ever. It was this incredible pain. Everything was just spinning 100 miles an hour. I was on the side of the bed. I was actually clinging to my radiator, thinking I was going to fall off. This incredible pain and dizziness was unbelievable. And you were how old at this time? I was 1+2. Had it ever occurred to you that at the age of 1+2 something like this might happen to you? Not in a million years. john is one of a growing number of younger stroke victims. A study of stroke hospital admissions in England over the course of 15 years found that among men aged 1+0-51+ there was an increase of nearly 50%. A similar story for women in the same age group, up by a third. The increase can’t be accounted for by population growth and changes to the way strokes are treated. Experts say obesity and sedentary lifestyles are to blame. Do you remember that? Yeah. I was a different person, then. Before I had my stroke. That’s how the girls remember you. For a while, john couldn’t speak, he was partially paralysed and lost his sight in one eye. The stroke had a profound impact on him, physically and mentally. I was an entirely different person. Flying off the handle and not understanding why. And then having to apologise to my wife, who I could see, quite clearly, that I had upset again. It’s the first I’ve seen it in this frame. john’s stroke cost him hisjob, but as he recovered he also retrained, eventually getting a degree in nursing and now he works with people with brain injuries, including stroke victims. It can be devastating for some people. A bit of determination, well, a lot of determination and itjust shows that, you know, life can go on. Experts say stroke is no longer something that just affects the elderly. john’s story shows survival is possible. I’m going to work, now. It’s a lesson more and more young people are having to learn. A brief look at some of the day’s other other news stories. Sussex Police have been criticised for missing an opportunity in 2008 to investigate jimmy Savile over an allegation of serious sexual assault. The woman said she was abused by Savile in Worthing in 1970. The Independent Police Complaints Commission says the officers who interviewed her, failed to encourage her to pursue the case. The US Secretary of State, john Kerry, has been meeting President Putin in the Black sea resort of Sochi. It’s Mr Kerry’s first visit to Russia since the start of the Ukraine crisis. The West has accused Russia of arming rebels in eastern Ukraine and sending troops there, charges that Moscow denies. Bank officials in Greece say the government has been able to make a repayment due on a bailout loan, using a reserve account held at the at the International Monetary Fund. There had been some doubts about how the Greek government would manage to find the seven hundred and fifty million euros. The cricketer Kevin Pietersen will not return to play for England this summer, despite scoring an unbeaten triple century for Surrey yesterday. After months of speculation about his future, the team’s new boss Andrew Strauss has ruled out Pietersen’s return saying there was a ""massive trust issue"" between them. Here’sjoe Wilson. At Lord’s, England’s new director, Andrew Strauss, had come to set out his vision for the future. Well, the past wasjust behind him. Elsewhere in London Kevin Pietersen was heading to 355 for Surrey, extraordinary. But perhaps unlike any British sportsman before him, when it comes to KP, it’s never simply about those sorts of scores. It’s trust. You can see there is no trust, everyone would probably agree that is the case. With the players or yourself? Between Kevin and the board. The England Cricket Board. Let’s not run away from the fact that that is the issue, that is the problem and that is the one we need to address if there is any future for Kevin in English cricket. At the moment, we are miles apart. Strauss and Pietersen’s relationship was strained by text messages sent by Pietersen to South African opponents. Pietersen was dropped, re-integrated and at the last Ashes, Pietersen was ""disengaged"", said England, dismissed. He wrote a book which ridiculed some former team-mates, bridges burned. On TV commentary, Strauss to his great regret when he had no idea he was being broadcast, used a word to describe Pietersen which would end my career, if I repeated it. But he knows Pietersen is an exceptional cricketer. Why on earth wouldn’t England use his star quality to generate attention in the team? Absolutely. .. I totally agree with you. I told you his capabilities as a batsman have never been in doubt. But if you have no trust in each other, I don’t know how you start. At the Oval, Surrey were soon fielding, Kevin Pietersen standing around, whilst everybody spoke about him. And of course, he does have supporters. You’ve got to give people what they want to see, you have got to play a brand of cricket that gets people excited. Gets kids excited, gets kids wanting to play the game. For that reason, Ijust think Kevin Pietersen is a tragic loss. Today brought the final confirmation. When Pietersen walks out to bat, he carries baggage with him, which is just too much for England to bear. Our top story this evening. Nepal has been hit by another massive earthquake, at least 1+1 people have been killed and more than 1,000 injured. Still to come: Later on BBC London. The London Firefighters whojoined the rescue mission in Nepal on how they prepare for search operations And The former drummer of the jam on the prospect of the Surrey band reforming. And, claims that artifical pitches don’t belong at the highest level of Scottish football £103 million, that’s how much this painting by Pablo Picasso sold for last night. It’s called the ""women of Algiers"". And it’s sold for a record price. Not surprisingly, who bought it is a mystery. Art experts say it’s a masterpiece, but some are asking CBFI any painting be worth that much? Our Arts editor, Will Gompertz, has been taking a look. Picasso’s Women of Algiers is on the verge of becoming the most expensive... at $160 million. Work of art. At $160 million, ladies and gentlemen, fair warning. To have ever been sold at auction. Selling it here. It’s yours. Sold. APPLAUSE. He produced it in 1955 in response to the work of his friend and rival Henri Matisse who’d recently died and as an homage to Eugene Delacroix’s 19 Century painting of the same name. There’s no doubt that Picasso’s painting is a high quality work of art. What’s special about it, from the point of view of the market, is that it is a last chance saloon. This is a fantastic painting. It shows that the owner is able to buy something exceptional which will show his wealth, his taste. It’s a trophy picture. That’s what makes it so compelling for the market. The market for first-class modern art is red hot. These pictures sold for an 18 months ago. This painting ways said to have sold for more than £190. The sale would I a pear to be a straight-forward affair. There was a buyer, sellerand straight-forward affair. There was a buyer, seller and an auctioneer to facilitate. The opaque nature of the or world means things are rarely that simple, particularly when big money is at stake. In order to win the real masterpieces, is a huge amount of competition and quite often the auction houses will offer guarantees to the Sellers. By guarantees we mean that the seller will be guaranteed a certain level of payment at the auction. Whether or not the artwork is bought, the seller will get paid. It’s a perfectly legal and increasingly common practice. It is risky and can leave the auction house financially exposed. That was not the case yesterday evening. Picasso’s painting was one of 31+lotts that sold, generating a total of £1+50 approximately million - not a bad night’s work. Will Gompertz, BBC News. The Chancellor, George Osborne, has been in Brussels today where he underlined the Government’s determination to push for reform in the European Union. The Conservatives, in their manifesto, said they wanted to tighten welfare rules for EU migrants, expand the single market, breaking down barriers to trade, and return powers from Brussels to Westminster. This morning, Osborne said Britain would stand firm in talks with EU leaders. We go into the negotiations aiming to be constructive and engaged, but also resolute and firm and no-one should under estimate our determination to succeed for the working people of Britain, indeed the working people of the whole of the UK. ~ -- European Union. Our Europe editor, Katya Adler, is in Brussels. So the Chancellor underlining Britain’s determination to get reform, what’s the reaction from other member states? George Osborne was here for a meeting of finance ministers not to start EU renegotiations. The UK referendum is coming. The unofficial focus of the meeting was George Osborne himself. He was sounding determined. He also had an inclusive message, saying Britain wanted to improve its relationship with the EU and reform would benefit all of its citizens. It needs European allies. George Osborne was not at the very first Cabinet meeting today. He choose to come here instead. Germany will be key as the EU’s most powerful nation. The German Finance Minister said he had a good chat with George Osborne and that the two men agreed to try to make progress on what the UK wants. David Cameron is in a strong starting position after his decisive election victory and for now there is a certain openness and enthusiasm for reform. I couldn’t promise you how long that will last. Thank you. He quit as party leaderjust hours after failing to win a seat in Westminster in the election but, just thee days later, Nigel Farage was already back in hisjob as leader of Ukip. So what happened? He’s been explaining his decision to our political correspondent, Alex Forsyth. Last Friday, and Nigel Farage had found out he’d failed to win a seat in Westminster at the election and, true to his word, he said he’d quit as Ukip’s leader. I am standing down as leader of Ukip. But fast forwarded a few days and in Brussels he’s back to work, and Nigel Farage’s back in the top Ukip job after his party refused his resignation. Didn’t you just engineer this? Didn’t the minute you realised that you might not take Thanet, you started to plot a course which meant you could come back because you know Ukip needs you? No. I walked out of that meeting yesterday having torn up the letter, scratching my head thinking - how on earth did that happen? I hadn’t planned it for one moment. I genuinely intended to take the summer off completely and to rethink my life. It undermines your credibility as a man who keeps his word? Well, I did keep my word. I did keep my word. For three days? I said publicly I was going, and I was a bit surprised. I certainly hadn’t expected it and I hadn’t expected the warmth of feeling and, quite frankly, emotion that was expressed from that meeting to me. Douglas Carswell refused to spend parliamentary funds the party is allowed on recruiting extra staff at Ukip’s request. The party says at no point did they tell him what to do. For Nigel Farage doing his dayjob in Brussels it’s the fist test of his newly reinstated leadership. Alex Forsyth, BBC News, Brussels. The coroner at an inquest into the deaths of two children during a family holiday in Corfu has told jurors they must return a verdict of unlawful killing. Bobby and Christi Shepherd were six and seven when they died from carbon monoxide poisoning in 2006. The inquest has heard a faulty boiler at their holiday bungalow was to blame. The El Nino weather pattern - which makes extreme weather events more likely - has sprung into life again for the first time in five years, according to scientists in Australia. It happens when the temperature of the Pacific rises and it can lead to droughts in some parts of the world and floods in others. jon Hammond, from BBC Weather, has the details: The big freeze in the winter of 2010 hit the UK hard. The country shivered as long periods of ice and heavy snow caused chaos. It’s severity was partly blamed on the El Nino effect and now, for the first time in five years, El Nino might be about to show its colours again. El Nino is a warming of the Pacific Ocean. Usually trade winds blow warm waters west across the Pacific towards Asia and Australasia with cold water welling up towards the Pacific Coast of South America. But when ocean temperatures in the east and central Pacific are consistently higher than usual, a burst of westerly winds occur, creating a large, slow moving current effectively pushing this warm water back towards South America, and so El Nino is born and can last as long as a year. Drier in Australia. Weaker monsoon in India. Heavier rain in South America. Fewer hurricanes in the States, but stronger, bigger typhoons in the Far East and, yes, colder winters in Europe. It releases an enormous amount of heat from the tropical Pacific Ocean into the atmosphere and has global consequences. The Indian monsoon is likely to be weaker than normal if El Nino wraps up as predicted and, similarly, other regions, remote regions, such as West Africa are also at risk of increased drought. El Nino never behaves in the same way twice, so trying to predict exactly where it might hit and how severe it might be is a tricky business, but itjust goes to make our weather even more interesting. Time for a look at the weather, here’sjon Hammond. That could be the long-term, what about this week? The sheep were enjoying the sunshine. Run-of-the-mill weather outside at the moment. Bright and breezy end to the day for many. There are blustery showers to the north-west. There is a hole in the cloud to the west of us. Optimistic for a a hole in the cloud to the west of us. Optimistic fora nice us. Optimistic for a nice day tomorrow. Furtherwest us. Optimistic for a nice day tomorrow. Further west in the Pacific a lot of cloud. A shock to the system for a lot of us on Thursday. The showers will continue across the north-west of Scotland into the night. Forthe across the north-west of Scotland into the night. For the rest of us a story of clearing skies and light winds. Temperatures will fall low indeed. Gardeners take note. We could see a touch of frost here in rural areas. could see a touch of frost here in ruralareas. It rural areas. It will affect those tender plants. A chilly start to the day tomorrow. Tomorrow will be a fantastic day for the vast majority of us. Sunshine from dawn to dusk. There will be cloud building up, virtually all of us will stay dry. Temperatures not spectacularly high around 11, 12, 13 degrees across Scotland and Northern Ireland. It will feel pleasant. Isolated showers to the north Pennines. 99% of us, more than that, will avoid the showers entirely and stay dry. Sunshine to southern parts of England and Wales it will cloud up across the far south-west. Thursday will turn wet indeed across central and southern parts of England and Wales. Some place cos catch an inch or more of rain. Northern and eastern parts of England, parts of Northern Ireland and particularly Scotland will miss out on the rain, fine weather here. Bleak further south with the wind and rain temperatures will be suppressed. Nowhere will it feel warm on Thursday. Hopefully for most of us Friday will be dryer.

Heathrow anti-expansion campaigners see him as the inside man -- anti-expansion campaigners see him as the inside man -- inside man. He could be the decisive factor. David Cameron fears him, he is a big beast in the party and his views will carry weight. Much will ride on the recommendations of the Davis commission which will report in the summer. There are three options. Zac Goldsmith promised in 2008 that he would stand down if his government backed Heathrow expansion but he said today he supported Boris in remaining as an MP. Ido not see any point in the hen leaving as an MP. I am thrilled to have him in Parliament and I would not want him to resign. That is more fighting to be done. The consultation was reopened on Friday to consider air pollution, a key -- reopened on Friday to consider air pollution, a key -- a key area which marks Heathrow down. They will also push for a new congestion zone around the airport if it got the go ahead to extent that back to expand. Not only can he kick up a stink about what could be a hugely unpopular policy U-turn but he can do it here from his new seat at the top table. In political terms it is a rare thing, a win-win situation. It is an issue which will only go up the political agenda. What does happen next? Everyone is eagerly awaiting the result of the commission. Nobody really can comment or knows which way it will go. Howard Davies will recommend expanding Heathrow or Gatwick. One thing said today was that he would not fight it, he does not want a report which will be shelved and gather dust or 20 years. Once he does make a recommendation, the real politics begins. Some of the public back it, some are against it. Big business are all for it. There is a trick here for the ambitious politician, lots of friends to be made but you could make a lot of enemies as well. Borisjohnson says he will fight for his principles and stand against expansion but he will remain in the Cabinet. He may well throw himself a bulldozer but not his political career. Thank you very much indeed. Lots more to come Thank you very much indeed. including: The London firefighters whojoined the search and rescue mission in Nepal on how they train for such disasters. A woman has been seriously injured after she was crushed under an advertising billboard which fell on her in a street in south London. It happened during rush hour this morning in Tooting.

She was taken to hospital but they are not life-threatening. We do not know how the billboard came down but the Health and Safety Executive have been informed. Local people say they are alarmed and they want to know how this could happen here. Thank you very much indeed. He’s been tipped by some to become Britain’s first black prime minister, and has drawn comparisons to Barak Obama. Now the MP for Streatham, Chuka Umunna, has made a significant move to try and enter Downing street by confirming he’s to stand for the Labour leadership. He made the announcement in a video on his Facebook page. So, is the Shadow Business Secretary the right man to bring Labour back to power? He was a key player in the former Labour team. He was a key player in the former Labourteam. No Ed He was a key player in the former Labour team. No Ed Miliband has resigned, Chuka Umunna said he is the one to take over. He announced his candidacy not on television but on Facebook. I am pleased to announce I will be standing for the leadership of the party. I think we can and should be winning in seats like Swindon. There are number of things we need to get right, it wasn’tjust relative to things we need to get right, it wasn’t just relative to the actual general election campaign but if you look at our five years in opposition, we need to talk to people who desire to get on and do well. Chuka Umunna grew up in south London and went to private school before attending Manchester University. He had a career in employment law before being elected. He rose quickly in the Labour Party and is being compared to the American president. The similarities go beyond skin colour. While Barack Obama has famous friends, Chuka Umunna managed to sheer stage with Will Smith at a school in London. It seems he is still a man of simple tastes. He is a regular customer. He comes every Sunday for an English breakfast. What do people in Streatham make of his plans? Even though I am not a Labour supporter, his plans? Even though I am not a Laboursupporter, I Labour supporter, I am quite happy for him to be the Labour leader, yes, definitely I feel he will do a betterjob than Ed Miliband. Do you think it is good he is a black guy running for the leadership? Everyone can have their chance. It is not about colour or race, it is about who is good. He voted for Ed Miliband to be leader last time, does that worry you? Now, he has resign now. It is done and dusted. He increased his majority at the election. People seem to like him in the area will stop but outside Streatham and London, do people even know who years? I’m asking people in Swindon if they recognise this man? Now, I do not. Swindon if they recognise this man? Now, Ido not. That is the Labour blog. Do you know his name? Chukka somebody. He is the possible leader of the Labour Party? At is correct. Does he come across better? He comes across and he has better answers. The full line-up of candidates is still to be confirmed but you can be certain you will see more of Chuka Umunna in the weeks to come. Three men have been arrested on suspicion of murder after the body of a woman was found inside a suitcase in a canal in West London. The body was found on Sunday in the Grand Union canal in Maida Vale. It’s thought the suitcase was dumped in the water at some point in the last two weeks. So far it is not known how the woman died. Police say they know the woman’s identity but won’t name her until next of kin are informed. The three men arrested remain in custody. The online retailer Amazon has announced it will create hundreds of newjobs in Dunstable. The company is opening a centre at Prologis Park this autumn and says it expects to create 500 jobs. Members of the RMT union who work on the Docklands Light Railway have voted to go on strike in a row over pay and conditions. Workers backed the decision to take industrial action by over four to one. The result will now be considered by the union’s executive. But the Rail Delivery Group, who represent the rail operators, say they are working to ensure contingency plans are in place to manage potential disruption to passengers. A group of london firefighters who’ve just returned from Nepal say they’re ready and prepared to return to the crisis hit country in light of today’s earthquake. The team were involved in the search and rescue mission when the disaster hit last month. We’ve been shown the extensive training they’re given in order to deal with such extreme conditions. Here’s Emilia Papadopoulos. Searching for survivors among the rubble last week, these London firefighters were sent to some of the most remote villages in Nepal after the earthquake. They are now back in the capital. It was absolutely astounding to see the amount of devastation we saw. All the training and multiple exercises we have known but to see what it is like in real life is overwhelming. All that training happens here in a warehouse in east London. He is getting the highest point. It is at training facilities this one that members of the London Fire Brigade are trained to deal with real-life situations such as the disaster in Nepal. This equipment looks underneath the ground and the camera looks through vloids in rubble to find people underneath. This is as close as you will get to the real thing. We proved that this week. It was pretty much what we expected to see. They were in Kathmandu for two weeks and did everything from search and rescue to handing out aid. One of the biggest jobs was repairing a hospital roof. Hospital staff did not want to go anywhere near it obviously. It was shutting down the hospital. The capacity of 800 beds down to about 80. We tried to make the hospital open again. Following news of the earthquake today, the team here say they would go back in a heartbeat. I would go back now. Because I have the skills to help people out there. If I can do that, that is great for them. Despite the rigorous training and experience like working on the bombings and Paddington crash, the group say nothing could prepare them for the sheer devastation they saw in Nepal. Dozens of parents have been protesting in Essex against a plan to change the rules on school transport. From September children will only get free travel if they are going to the nearest school. The county council says the new system will be clearer and fairer. And early morning walk to catch the bash to school in a village near Braintree at four their parents, the school bus could be about to become expensive. It will cost me between 100 and £150 a month which will release strictures. You could send them to the new school? We could do but this is a feeder school with establish links to a secondary school. The children are comfortable with that school. This morning, once the children were safely on-board, their parents protested at County Hall over changes they say are unfair. Pupils will only be eligible for free transport to their nearest school but their nearest school is not necessarily the one that generations of pupils have gone to. It is part of the problem, siblings may have to go to different schools from their brothers and sisters and friends. To head teachersjoined the protesters. We are not able to carry through the existing relationships of feeder schools that we have had for many years. Parents urged the County Council to think again but one councillor explained why the changes are needed. It means in future years, given that we spend millions of pounds a year on school transport, we will not have a situation where be completely lose control of that budget because of the shifting nature of catchment areas and school admissions policies. But parents set the protests will continue. Still to come. The London children who received gifts from America during World War Two - how a charity now wants to find them. Plus - The story of the jam told in the first autobiography by a member of the Surrey band. We got more details today of how the controversial Garden Bridge will look as the design for its gardens was revealed. Critics say it’s in the wrong place, but the designers say it’ll be inspirational. Our Transport Correspondent Tom Edwards is where it’ll be now by the Thames. We’re on the north bank of the Thames. This is where the bridge will go from, from the roof of Temple station across the river Thames and land on the South bank, just next to ITV Studios. Today we got more detail about what it will look like. River Soar views have started to see what the bridge will be built on. Plans revealing the gardens were shown today. Marshlands, woodlands and ornamental gardens. We want this to be a garden which is a centre of horticultural excellence where plants are used in a naturalistic we with a range of fine she may not see in an everyday garden. We wanted to be somewhere unique that we can be proud of right in the heart of the city. The bridge will cost £170 million. 125 of that has already been pledged. The Garden Bridge trust says there has listened to those who have concerns about the project. There will be 300 trees now on the bridge and reviews will not be as badly obscured as they would have been initially but that is still of -- have been initially but that is still of -- still opposition to the scheme and it will end up in court. It will face a judicial review. Opponents have concerns about overcrowding, maintenance costs and damage to protected views. The biggest concerns are the impact on what is there now. That is a gorgeous space and we have one of the best walking places along the South bank. 26 million people enjoy that space. That will be trashed if people come and cute across this page. If they start charging people to cross the bridge it will be worse. We think it will create a precedent for other parts and gardens in this country, somewhere which will be a real focus along the river and something which is not anywhere else, it will be unique. Do you think it is in the right place? I think it is for this particular experience. The Church insists it will not charge for entry and operating costs will be met through fundraising. The case is expected to be heard in the High Court injune. The trust remain confident they will be able to finish this garden bridge by summer 2018. Thank you. As part of the 70th anniversary of VE day, an American charity is trying to trace Londoners who benefited from the aid packages they delivered during World War Two. Care international provided gifts of food and supplies from the American people. Many were given to children and the vulnerable who had to survive under strict rationing. Ayshea Buksh has the story. The war may have been all over but across the UK families continued to suffer after VE day because of rationing. Someone who remembers it well isjohn who rationing. Someone who remembers it well is john who grew up rationing. Someone who remembers it well isjohn who grew up in Kennington, south London. I remember powdered eggs in particular. I did not know eggs had shells on them. I do not remember having fruit as a child. I saw an orange at Christmas time, that was it. This is a gesture of goodwill, rice, but are included. The diet was supplemented by aid packages sent by American families. These shipments were organised by the charity. This care package is tailored to British tastes and includes steak and kidney pudding, coffee, evaporated milk, baked beans. 70 years on they want to trace people who receive those parcels as part of their anniversary. We want to remind the public that it is within living memory, we in the UK where the recipients of food aid, we were starting within living memory. With help from people across the Atlantic, we were able to get back on feet as a society. The charity now works in 74 developing countries and delivers aid to those in need, such as the victims of the Nepal earthquake. It is a wonderful thing to happen at any time. It should be encouraged all the time, we have plenty now, we are very rich and we should be willing to give the way the Americans gave to us. As the search begins for the original recipients of the aid, the rule of such charities internationally appears to be more important than ever. -- thejob appears to be more important than ever. -- the job of such charities. Now they were the Surrey band who had 18 consecutive hits including four number ones. During the 70’s and 80’s the jam rose from the punk rock scene to musical and commercial success. The story of the band and its singer Paul Weller’s decision to split has now been documented in a new book by drummer Rick Buckler. Sarah Harris has been to meet him. More than 30 years on from the height of his fame as the drummer with the jam, Rick Buckler is back at his old stomping ground in Soho, a famous meeting point for Mods in the 70s and where things took off for three young men who met at school in Woking. We used to hang around at school and a teacher let us use the music room at lunch times. We would get together with people who played guitar, drummers. Schoolmate Paul Weller was of course the singer and leader of the band. Rick describes how they signed their first record deal. MUSIC: Eton Rifles. The jam had 18 consecutive hits and four number one singles together but when it ended, Rick says it was Paul’s decision. We did not have the wherewithal to take control of this ourselves and slow down and take a break or whatever. So Pauljust said he wanted to leave. We tried to persuade him but he had made his mind up and that was that. What about the future, after so much success does he dream about the jam being preformed? Well, it is down to Paul and he is never going to reform the jam. In some ways it might not be the best thing to do but on the other hand, there is a sneaky feeling that if we could, we would. You will not find fans disagreeing with that. Time for the weather now. It is pleasantly warm for this time of year as well. We have a satellite picture here showing the rain that we have this morning. We have these clouds. Some decent sunny spells. Even at Cloud has melted away so we go into the night with clear skies. Suburbs are down to 5 degrees. There will be one too cold spots in the countryside. So that process is happening as we speak. The skies are clearing and the wind is easing back. We have dry air out there as well which is why we will get the lower temperatures. You will notice that chilly feel when you wake up. The winds will be a lot lighter than they were today. Some high cloud in the afternoon but the sun will be shining throughout. We’re looking at UP shining throughout. We’re looking at up to 17 degrees across the Home Counties. Perhaps reaching 19 degrees across London itself. Look away now if that is weather you like because he is Thursday, it could rain all day. It will feel chilly. You can see the knock-on effect on the temperature which is caused by the behind it. You can see this cold fronts. That will settle down as we go through the weekends. Thursday is the blip and then it is a return to fine conditions. Thank you. The main headlines. A powerful earthquake has struck Nepal, less than three weeks after 8,000 people were killed by a previous tremor. The earthquake brought down buildings in Kathmandu with dozens of people confirmed dead and over a thousand injured. The first Conservative cabinet for 18 years met in Downing Street today as David Cameron completed his government reshuffle. The Prime Minister said the Conservatives must be ""the real party of working people"". And the Streatham MP, Chuka Ummuna, has confirmed he willjoin the contest to become Labour’s new leader.

Panic returns to the streets of Kathmandu - dozens more people have died and over 1,000 have been injured. The powerful tremors rock Nepal’s parliament as politicians are forced to flee to safety. The problem is, there are lots of buildings here that are damaged, that they’re worried may collapse. There’s a building here to my right. There’s a big gouge down the left-hand side of it. Six American Marines involved in the relief operation are missing after their helicopter disappeared. We’ll have the latest. Also tonight: The first all Conservative Cabinet for 18 years - it’s the real party of working people says David Cameron. The prospect of the first national rail strike for more than 20 years after thousands of workers vote to strike over pay. Kevin Pietersen says he’s absolutely devastated to be told there’s no return to the England team because of a lack of trust. Look, who cares if they all get on like happy campers in the dressing room. They’re not here to sing love songs to each another- they’re here to try and win back the Ashes. And a new world record as this Picasso goes under the hammer for £103 million. Later: Borisjohnson says he won’t resign as an MP if Heathrow expansion gets the go-ahead. The Streatham MP confirms he will join the contest to become Labour’s new leader. Good evening. Another powerful earthquake has struck Nepal killing dozens more people and bringing fresh terror to a traumatised country. In Kathmandu the quake sent residents fleeing onto the streets - and in remote areas communities were cut off by landslides. More than 1,000 people were injured. Simon Cox was in Kathmandu when the quake struck and has sent this report. They thought the terror had gone, but today it returned. Within moments of the first tremor, people poured on to the streets. Their first priority - to make sure loved ones were safe. I’m trying to call my home, but it’s busy. I’m worried for my family. For now, safety means being outside, even if you’re sick. These patients were evacuated from a hospital in Kathmandu. Others hurt in the previous quake were having to be rescued again. I think it’s a really big earthquake. Every wall is moving like that. There have been at least 1,000 people injured, some as already weakened buildings gave way. This is the clearest sign of the damage from today’s earthquake. This was a five-storey house that’s collapsed. No-one was inside. But the problem is, that there are lots of buildings here that are damaged, that they are worried may collapse. There is a big gouge down the left-hand side of this building. Nowhere was immune. Nepal’s Parliament was meeting to figure out how to rebuild their shattered country when politicians were caught in the middle of another quake. People knew to get outside right away and the cars were shaking, the buildings were swaying, and one of the most shocking things was how long the earthquake went on for. The worst damage was near the epicentre in the east of Nepal, the shockwaves triggering this landslide north of Kathmandu. And from the air, the devastation is clear, in towns near the Chinese border, where at least four people have died. The grim task has begun of recovering bodies. An aid worker capturing the moments as the wounded were taken away. Tonight, in the capital, people are shunning their homes, bedding down for the evening outdoors hoping the worst is over, but fearing there may be more shocks ahead. Simon Cox, BBC News, Nepal. With me now is Paul Adams. Terrible for the people of Nepal. How much more of a setback is this going to prove to be? It is an enormous setback. More people on the streets. They need looking after. And with every crack like those in his report, the cost of reconstruction simply multiplies. It is already in the billions. It is bound to be going up after this. That means that Nepal will need more aid. The UN is saying they have only managed to raise a fraction of what is needed, even before today. Relief workers are still there in numbers. That is a good thing. As always, with the last quake and this one, it is those remote mountain communities that are the real challenge. Even before today, Save the Children was saying it was going to take months, if not years, for some of those places to get back to normal. Then there’s the mental quake, the psychological damage, which may be as bad as the physical damage in this case. People have been working very hard, particularly with children, to try and allay their fears and all of that swept away in a few seconds. Thank you. The first all Conservative Cabinet for 18 years met at Downing Street today. David Cameron said his new Government would focus on ""bread and butter"" ways of improving people’s lives - concentrating on jobs and childcare. He said the new Government would be different from the Coalition in that it wouldn’t have to ""trade away"" policies and would therefore be more accountable. Our Deputy Political Editor, james Landale, reports on the new Government’s first Cabinet meeting. To the victors, the smiles. This is the first fully Conservative Cabinet in almost two decades. Many faces may be familiar, but today the cameras were allowed in to show there are a few more women around the table, a few more ministers from modest backgrounds. The message was clear: This Cabinet may be led by an old Etonian, but it is promising to govern for ordinary people. Some pundits might call it blue-collar conservatism, or being on the side of hard-working taxpayers. I would call it the real party of working people, giving more people the dignity of work... He and they are going to spend much of the next five years cutting spending and arguing about Europe and the Union. Today, he tried to set a different agenda, promising compassion, social justice and. .. The down to earth bread and butter issues we were elected to deliver on and that is what we have to do in this Parliament. The embodiment of blue-collar conservatism is Robert Halfon, the new Tory Deputy Chairman, a campaigning MP from Harlow in Essex. So we went to his constituency to find some workers and see what they thought of what the Tories are offering them. A promise to cut the amount a family can claim in benefits from £26,000 to £23,000 to pay for more apprenticeships, to give working parents with three to four-year-olds 30 hours of free childcare a week, twice as much as now. There is also a promise to make it harder for workers to go on strike, by raising ballot thresholds. Do you think David Cameron understands working-class people? No. Because he’s - I don’t think he’s personally been there. He’s been fed with a spoon since he was little and those of working-class have had to work their way up, earn a living to pay our bills. Do you think the Tories, or any politicians, can represent working people? I don’t think so. They never get their hands dirty. Do the Tories represent working people, do you think? I think as long as they stay true to their word, and do what they have promised, they could do, yes. So, even in Harlow, where the Tories increased their majority, the party may find it takes time to change their image. David Cameron has onlyjust been returned to office and already he is thinking about the next election. He wants the Conservatives to try to shed their image as a party of the rich by appealing to blue-collar workers in places like here in Harlow and elsewhere, people who, in the past, have voted Labour and Ukip. Labour’s newly-elected MPs are still looking for a leader. Today, another hopeful put his hat into the ring. But he wants the party to appeal to the middle-classes, notjust its traditional supporters. We need to talk to people’s desire to get on and do well, their aspirations, and that, by the way, it’s often talked about in terms of Middle England. I think that aspiration goes all the way down the salary spectrum. So in Essex and elsewhere, the battle for voters’ hearts and minds is on, five years before the next election. james Landale, BBC News, in Harlow. The prospect of the first national rail strike in more than 20 years is looming after thousands of rail workers voted overwhelmingly in favour of strike action over pay. It comes on the day that the Government outlined plans to press ahead with tightening the laws on industrial action. Our Business Editor, Kamal Ahmed, reports on the Government’s planned new strike laws. It could see the first clash between union power and the new Conservative Government. Today, the major rail union, the RMT, announced its members had voted for strike action on the same day the Government announced it wanted to make it harder for workers to go on strike in the first place. The Business Secretary told the BBC the public needed more protection. What people are fed up of is strike action that hasn’t been properly supported by the members of the relevant union. Especially when it comes to essential public services. Think of the impact it has - transport, Health Service, on ordinary people going about their dailyjobs. Commuters at Waterloo Station had mixed views on the plans to curtail strikes. There needs to be a greater proportion of the union members who need to vote in a particular direction for striking. It causes me personal annoyance. I still will defend their right to strike. It is hard enough already. I don’t think it needs to be harder. People have a right to withdraw their labour if they are not getting rewarded properly. What are the plans for new strike laws? There will need to be a 50% turnout for all strike ballots. For essential services all strike ballots. For essential services like health and transport, 40% of those eligible to vote will have to be in favour of the strike. Union leaders said the new rules were an attack on democracy. This will not help ordinary people get fair pay. No other Western democracy applies the rules that the Government is planning to impose on unions here. The Business Secretary wants a more muscular approach to industrial relations. Here at the Department for Business, there has been a change of tone. It’s got its first Conservative head for 18 years. The new Business Secretary has certainly made no secret of what he describes as his relentlessly pro-business, pro-enterprise credentials. On the wall of his office at his previous job, a picture of Margaret Thatcher. 1994, the last time Britain faced a national rail strike. These are precisely the pictures the Government doesn’t want to see ever again. Whilst the Prime Minister was hosting his new Cabinet in Downing Street, the Chancellor, George Osborne, was at an EU finance meeting in Brussels. He’s been tasked with leading talks on reform of the EU, ahead of a referendum on UK membership. Our Europe Editor, Katya Adler, reports on the landscape in which the negotiations on Europe will take place. This was supposed to be a scheduled meeting of EU Finance Ministers. When the Chancellor came today to the heart of Europe his Government wants to change, he became the focus of attention. We come here with a very clear mandate to improve Britain’s relationship with the rest of the EU and to reform the EU so it creates jobs and increases living standards for all its citizens. Britain needs allies in Europe to achieve significant change. Germany will be key. George Osborne missed the first Cabinet meeting to be here, it paid off, though it is early days. It is not up to George Osborne and me to decide on reform of the EU. What we did talk about and what we agreed on is that we would both do our best to make progress on these issues. The European Union has 24 official languages, you hear most of them around here in an afternoon. At the moment people are talking about the new Deal Britain wants from the EU. George Osborne said that will benefit all of Europe’s citizens and it is true there is a huge appetite for change but it is also true there are about as many opinions on how it should be changed as there are European languages. The UK is opening the door on the debate and the EU could get pulled in all sorts of directions. Britain is not alone in wanting less Brussels in daily life, but there are Europeans who want a whole lot more. A number of countries want to go further in negotiation. At the same time countries like Britain who want to not participate in all policies, give them a special membership. So, the two track European Union? Effectively. Others worry that the British debate could lead to the unravelling of the EU. It is unavailable, in a country like Spain people feel like these negotiations are taking place and the question would be why not us? The question of what kind of Europe is best for Britain has torn apart previous Tory government. David Cameron has resolved to sort out the issue. A brief look at some of the day’s other news stories: Nearly 30 letters sent by Prince Charles to Government ministers between 2004 and 2005 are to be published tomorrow. It follows a ruling by the Supreme Court, and a ten-year battle by the Guardian newspaper to get them released. The letters have been called the ""black spider memos"" because of the Prince’s scrawled handwriting. The coroner at an inquest into the deaths of two children during a family holiday in Corfu has told jurors they must return a verdict of unlawful killing. Bobby and Christi Shepherd died from carbon monoxide poisoning in 2006. The inquest has heard a faulty boiler at their holiday bungalow was to blame. Kevin Pietersen says he’s absolutely devastated after being told he will not return to play for England this summer, despite scoring an unbeaten triple century for Surrey. After months of speculation about his future, the team’s new boss, Andrew Strauss, has ruled out Pietersen’s return, saying there was a massive trust issue between them. Here’sjoe Wilson. At Lord’s, England’s new director, Andrew Strauss, had come to set out his vision for English cricket’s future, while the past wasjust behind him. Elsewhere in London, Kevin Pietersen was heading to 355 for Surrey, extraordinary. But there are always other scores with Pietersen. It is a question of trust. You can see there is no trust. I think everybody would probably agree that is the case. With the players? Between Kevin and the board. But let’s not run away from the fact that that is the issue, that is the problem and that is the one we need to address if there is any future for Kevin in English cricket. At the moment we are miles apart. Strauss and Pietersen’s relationship was strained by text messages sent by Pietersen to South African opponents. Pietersen has been dropped, reintegrated, accused of being disengaged. He wrote a book which ridiculed some former team-mates. On TV commentary, Strauss, to his great regret and without realising it, described Pietersen with a word that would end my career if I repeated it. He also knows that Pietersen is exceptional. Why wouldn’t England use his star quality to generate attention in the team? I totally agree. His capability as a batsman has never been in doubt but if you have no trust in each other I don’t know how you start. In a comment for the Telegraph Kevin Pietersen has attacked the ECB with venom. He was promised he had an England future if he made runs for Surrey. He said: And Pietersen has supporters. His most recent score 355 not out. If thatis most recent score 355 not out. If that is not good enough to get into this team after the disastrous 15 months we have, I should be the Archbishop of Canterbury. Kevin Pietersen declined my invitation for comment. Read his mood. England’s all-time leading run scorer had reached the end. The Government says it will opt out of controversial plans for European countries to adopt a quota system for migrants. The European Commission’s proposals are being sent to all EU countries tomorrow. The number of people who have tried to cross the Mediterranean so far this year is estimated to be almost 63,500. More than 1,800 are thought to have died. Our correspondent Damian Grammaticas has been following one Syrian who survived when his boat sank off the coast of Rhodes. He’s now made it to Germany where he’s seeking asylum, from where Damian sent this report. This is Furth, with its quiet alleyways and centuries-old inns. All peace and prosperity, exactly what is drawing thousands to risk their lives to get to Europe every week now. Among the newest arrivals, Mohammed. We first met him just after he filmed himself being smuggled from Turkey to Greece three weeks ago. The boat smashed to pieces on the island of Rhodes. Mohammed was one of 90 saved from the waves, then allowed into Greece. At the time he told us he was delighted to have made it to Europe. Finally I get free. It’s OK now, I want to take my breakfast, go out, take a shower. Today he is in Germany. He says while in Greece he paid 3500 euros for an air ticket and documents, but he was stopped by immigration officers at Athens airport. They think it’s a fake passport, you know? They took the passport off you? Yes. And said try again? Yes. So you tried again? Yes, I tried again and they said ""not today"". OK, then I tried a third time. No one talked with me. Third time lucky. Yes. Europe’s problem is who should house all the new arrivals. The reception centre in this one small town, Furth, has seen 1000 asylum seekers this year, five times more than the UK as a whole took in from Syria last year. I think it is necessary that all European countries help. We need a quota for all European countries because only then you have a good solution for this theme. Getting other countries to share the burden though won’t be easy. The UK today said it will oppose any European scheme to force nations to take quotas of asylum seekers, but there are thousands more waiting on the shores of the Mediterranean to take the same journey Mohammed did. And he says those Syrians, faced with a choice of returning to a country in conflict or risking the sea, will take to their boats whatever leaders decide. We have the war here and the sea here. They can go back to the war or go to the sea, they will go to the sea. It is a chance. The chance Mohammed wants is to study and be a banker. He knows Germany takes all Syrians like him in, but what is not yet clear is where his own journey still has to take him. The Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, and the US Secretary of State john Kerry have urged all sides in Ukraine to stop breaching the ceasefire, and pledged to work together to try to bring about a peace settlement. john Kerry visited the Russian leader in the Black Sea resort of Sochi. It’s Mr Kerry’s first visit to Russia since the start of the Ukraine crisis. The two agreed that the Minsk ceasefire agreement should be fully implemented to establish peace in Ukraine. Bank officials in Greece say the government has been able to make a repayment due on a bailout loan using a reserve account held at the International Monetary Fund. It was supposed to be acting as a buffer for Greece but it’s now depleted. He quit as party leaderjust hours after failing to win a seat in Westminster in the election, butjust three days later Nigel Farage was already back in hisjob as leader of Ukip. So, what happened? He’s been explaining his decision to our Political Correspondent Alex Forsyth. Last Friday, Nigel Farage true to his word said he would quit as Ukip leader. But fast forward a few days and in Brussels he is back to work. Nigel Farage is back in the top Ukip job after his party refused his resignation at a meeting yesterday. Didn’t you just engineered this? Didn’t you do -- Didn’t you just engineered this? Didn’t you do -- plot a course to come back because you knew Ukip would need you? No, Iwas come back because you knew Ukip would need you? No, I was scratching mY would need you? No, I was scratching my head thinking how would that happen. I genuinely intended to take the summer off and rethink my life. And it undermined your credibility as a man who keeps his word. I did keep my word. I said publicly I was going and I was a bit surprised. I didn’t expect it, and quite frankly the emotion that was expressed from that meeting to me. Nigel Farage was always due to be back here in Brussels as an MEP even if he didn’t expect to be at the helm of Ukip and now as leader he faces another challenge. There is a major stand-off brewing between senior Ukip figures over public money they are entitled to receive. In Westminster opposition parties get public funds to help with Parliamentary business. Ukip is due over £600,000 because it got nearly 4 million votes. Douglas Carswell says party officials told him to spend this on 15 new Ukip staff but he thinks that is improper. Others in Ukip denied telling him what to do but say it is for the party to decide how to spend the money. For Nigel Farage doing his dayjob in Brussels, such tussles at senior levels represent the first serious row he will have to resolve. £103 million, that’s how much this painting by Pablo Picasso sold for last night. The title is the Women Of Algiers, the price is a world record, and the buyer is a mystery. Art experts say it’s a masterpiece, but some are asking- can any painting be worth that much? Our Arts Editor Will Gompertz has been taking a look. Go a long way. 59,500,000. Would you give me one I60? Picasso’s Women Of Algiers is on the verge... 160 million. ...of becoming the most expensive... At $160 million. ...work ofart. At $160 million, ladies and gentlemen. Fairwarning. ...to have ever been sold at auction. Selling it here. It’s yours. Sold. APPLAUSE. He produced it in 1955, in response to the work of his friend and rival, Henri Matisse, who’d recently died, and as an homage to Eugene Delacroix’s 19th Century painting of the same name. There’s no doubt that Picasso’s painting is a high quality work of art. What’s special about it, from the point of view of the market, is that it is a last chance saloon. This is a fantastic painting. It shows that the owner is able to buy something exceptional which will show his wealth, his taste. It’s a trophy picture and that’s what makes it so compelling for the market. The market for first-class modern art is red hot. Last night’s sale also saw this work by Giacometti break the auction record for a sculpture. Three studies of Lucian Freud by Francis Bacon sold for a then record sum 18 months ago. Then there are the works that are not auctioned, but are sold privately, such as this painting by Paul Gogan, which is said to have sold for more than £190 million. Last night’s sale would appear to be a fairly straight-forward affair. There was a buyer, a seller and an auctioneer to facilitate, but the opaque nature of the art world means that things are rarely that simple, particularly when big money is at stake. In order to win the real masterpieces, there’s a huge amount of competition and quite often the auction houses will offer guarantees to the sellers. By guarantees we mean that the seller will be guaranteed a certain level of payment at the auction. So whether or not the artwork is bought, the seller will get paid. It’s a perfectly legal and increasingly common practice, but it is risky and can leave the auction house financially exposed. But that was not the case yesterday evening. Picasso’s painting was one of 34 lots that sold, generating a total of £450 million - not a bad night’s work. Will Gompertz, BBC News. Newsnight is on BBC Two. Here is Evan Davis. Tonight the great Europe debate, what the EU says about our new government. And the great Kevin Pietersen debate as well. join me for that on BBC Two. Now it is time for the news where you are. Tonight on BBC London News: Borisjohnson says he won’t resign as an MP if Heathrow expansion gets the go ahead - but vows to fight the plan. Boris could be the decisive factor in whether this Government can build a third runway or cannot. Also tonight: the Streatham MP Chuka Umunna confirms he’lljoin the contest to be Labour leader. We’ll be asking if he’s got what it takes? And we take a first look at the plans for the gardens designed for the capital’s controversial new river crossing. Plus, your local and national weather’s coming up. Welcome to BBC London News with me, Victoria Hollins. Boris johnson has vowed to fight any move to expand Heathrow airport. But says he won’t resign from Parliament if the Government backs a third runway. A decision on aviation expansion is expected this summer after the Airport Commission makes its recommendations. The newly-elected MP for Uxbridge said this morning rather than standing down it was best for him to remain in Parliament and fight Heathrow expansion plans. Some campaigners say he’s now become the decisive factor. Marc Ashdown reports. just how far will Boris johnson go to fight against expansion at Heathrow? On Friday, it seemed quite far. I will lie down with you in front of those bulldozers and stop the building - stop the construction of that third runway. Asked today if he would make a stand and give us his newjob as MP in protest, maybe not. Would it be a resigning issue for you? I don’t have a position to resign from, I’m the Member... Would you force a by-election or something? Well, I think I would be better off staying in Parliament to fight the case, frankly. So does it matter? Heathrow anti-expansion campaigners see him as their inside man. Boris could be the decisive factor in whether this Government can build a third runway or cannot. David Cameron - fearsome, he’s a big beast in the party - and he’s his views will carry weight. Much is riding on the recommendations made in the Davis Commission, which is consulting on airport expansion and will report in the summer. There are three options - a third runway at Heathrow, extending one of Heathrow’s existing runways, or adding a second runway at Gatwick. Zac Goldsmith promised in 2008 he would stand down if his Government backed Heathrow expansion, but today said he supports Boris staying. I wouldn’t see any advantage in Borisjohnson stepping down as an MP and forfeiting his ability to campaign on this issue. He is one of the most formidable campaigners in Parliament. I’m thrilled to have him there. I wouldn’t want him to resign over Heathrow. I want him to hang around and fight. There is more fighting to be done. On Friday the consultation was re-opened to consider the impact of air pollution - a key area and one which heavily marks Heathrow down. Boris johnson also said today he’d push for a new congestion zone around the airport if it got the go-ahead to expand. Some will see this as a very canny political move by Boris johnson. Not only can he kick up a merry stink about what may well become a hugely unpopular policy U-turn, but he can do it from here at his new seat at the top table.

49,BBC1 London,12-may-2015,BBC London News,22:30,15 mins,True,"Welcome to BBC London News with me, Victoria Hollins. Boris johnson has vowed to fight any move to expand Heathrow airport. But says he won’t resign from Parliament if the Government backs a third runway. A decision on aviation expansion is expected this summer after the Airport Commission makes its recommendations. The newly-elected MP for Uxbridge said this morning rather than standing down it was best for him to remain in Parliament and fight Heathrow expansion plans. Some campaigners say he’s now become the decisive factor. Marc Ashdown reports. just how far will Boris johnson go to fight against expansion at Heathrow? On Friday, it seemed quite far. I will lie down with you in front of those bulldozers and stop the building - stop the construction of that third runway. Asked today if he would make a stand and give us his newjob as MP in protest, maybe not. Would it be a resigning issue for you? I don’t have a position to resign from, I’m the Member... Would you force a by-election or something? Well, I think I would be better off staying in Parliament to fight the case, frankly. So does it matter? Heathrow anti-expansion campaigners see him as their inside man. Boris could be the decisive factor in whether this Government can build a third runway or cannot. David Cameron - fearsome, he’s a big beast in the party - and he’s his views will carry weight. Much is riding on the recommendations made in the Davis Commission, which is consulting on airport expansion and will report in the summer. There are three options - a third runway at Heathrow, extending one of Heathrow’s existing runways, or adding a second runway at Gatwick. Zac Goldsmith promised in 2008 he would stand down if his Government backed Heathrow expansion, but today said he supports Boris staying. I wouldn’t see any advantage in Borisjohnson stepping down as an MP and forfeiting his ability to campaign on this issue. He is one of the most formidable campaigners in Parliament. I’m thrilled to have him there. I wouldn’t want him to resign over Heathrow. I want him to hang around and fight. There is more fighting to be done. On Friday the consultation was re-opened to consider the impact of air pollution - a key area and one which heavily marks Heathrow down. Boris johnson also said today he’d push for a new congestion zone around the airport if it got the go-ahead to expand. Some will see this as a very canny political move by Boris johnson. Not only can he kick up a merry stink about what may well become a hugely unpopular policy U-turn, but he can do it from here at his new seat at the top table. In political terms, it is a rare thing, a win-win situation. Well, Marcjoins me now. What does happen next? Everyone’s eagerly awaiting the results of this commission. It could be as early as next month. Howard Davis will recommend expanding Heathrow or Gatwick. It is really hard to call. No-one knows which way lit go. Zac Goldsmith did say he doesn’t think he will fudge it, this is the kind of guy who doesn’t want a report that will be left on the shelves of the Department for Transport for the next 20 years, so he won’t sit on the fence.

A woman’s been seriously injured after she was crushed under an advertising billboard which fell on her in a South London street. It happened during rush hour this morning in Tooting, she was rushed to hospital with leg and hip injuries. It’s thought the billboard, which was next to a block of flats, was only put up recently. Three men have been arrested on suspicion of murder after the body of a woman was found inside a suitcase in a canal in West London. The body was found on Sunday in the Grand Union Canal in Maida Vale. It’s thought the suitcase was dumped in the water at some point in the last two weeks. So far it is not known how the woman died. Police say they know the woman’s identity but won’t name her until next of kin are informed. The three men arrested remain in custody. He’s been tipped by some to become Britain’s first black Prime Minister, and has drawn comparisons to Barack Obama. Now the MP for Streatham, Chuka Umunna, has made a significant move to try and enter Downing Street by confirming he’s to stand for the Labour leadership. He made the announcement in a video on his Facebook page. Here’s Tarah Welsh. He was close to the former Labour Leader and a key player in the election campaign. But now that Ed Miliband’s resigned, Chuka Umunna says he’s the man to take over. And to emphasise that he’s of the next generation, he announced his candidacy, not on television, but on Facebook. I’m pleased today to be announcing that I will be standing for the leadership of the party. There are undoubtedly a number of things that we need to get right, which wasn’tjust relative to the actual General Election campaign itself, but if you look at our five years in opposition, which is we need to talk to people’s desire to get on and do well, their aspirations. Chuka Umunna grew up in South London and went to private school there, before going to the University of Manchester. He had a career in employment law before being elected as the MP for Streatham in 2010. He rose quickly within the Labour Party and has even been compared to the American President- and it seems the similarities go beyond skin colour. While Barack Obama campaigns with celebrity friends like jay-Z, Chuka managed to share a stage with Will Smith at this school in South London. And despite his aspirations, it seems he’s still a man of simple tastes. He is my regular customer. He comes in every Sunday, has a full English breakfast. He is a well-known person in this area. What do people in Streatham make of his plans? Even though I’m not a Labour supporter, I am quite happy for him to be the Labour Leader, yes. Definitely, I feel, he’ll do a betterjob than Ed. Do you think it is good that he’s a black guy that is running for the Labour Leadership? Is it good to have a black person leading a party? Everyone can have their chance, so it is not about colour, it is not about race, it is about who is good. He voted for Ed Miliband to be leader last time, does that worry you? No, Ed has resigned now. It’s going to be - it’s done and dusted. The full line-up of candidates is yet to be confirmed but you can be certain you’ll be seeing more of Chuka Umunna in the weeks and months to come. Tarah Welsh, BBC London News. Members of the RMT Union who work on the Docklands Light Railway have voted to go on strike in a row over pay and conditions. Workers backed the decision to take industrial action by over four to one. The result will now be considered by the union’s executive. But the Rail Delivery Group, who represent the rail operators, say they will put plans in place to minimise potential disruption to passengers. The online retailer Amazon has announced it will create hundreds of newjobs in Dunstable. The company is opening a centre at Prologis Park this autumn and says it expects to create 500 jobs. School children in Essex will no longer be able to ride on school buses for free, if they live three miles or more from school. Today parents have been protesting outside the County Hall in Chelmsford. They claim the new fares, which start in September, will be too expensive and could lead to siblings attending separate schools. But the council say the new rules will help save money. We got more details today of how the controversial Garden Bridge will look as the design for its gardens was revealed. The Bridge will span the Thames between Temple and the South Bank. Critics say it’s in the wrong place, but the designers say it’ll be inspirational. Here’s our Transport Correspondent, Tom Edwards. In the Thames, river surveys have started to see what the Garden Bridge will be built on. Today, more progress, plans revealing the gardens. This image shows what they will look like with marshland, woodland and ornamental gardens. We want this to be a garden that is a centre of horticultural excellence, with plants that are used in a naturalistic way. Where there are plants that you might not see in an everyday garden. For it to be somewhere that really is unique, something that we can be proud of as a nation, right in the very heart of our city. The bridge will cost £170 million. £125 million has already been pledged, including £30 million each from the Treasury and Transport for London. The Garden Bridge trust has said it has listened to those who have concerns about this project. There will be 300 trees, now, on the bridge. The views will not be as badly obscured as they were going to be, initially. But there is still opposition to this scheme. It will end up in court. The scheme will face a judicial review. Opponents have concerns about overcrowding, maintenance costs and damage to protected views. The biggest concerns are the impact on what is there now. is B QOFQEOUS, QOFQEOUS SPBCE. We have one of the great walking spaces of Britain along the South Bank. 26 million people enjoy that space. That will be trashed if 7 million more people have to come and queue to get on this bridge. If they can’t afford to run it and they have to start charging people to get on this bridge, it will get worse. We feel we will be able to create something that will be a precedent for other parks and gardens in this country. Something that becomes a real focus along that particular part of the river and something which isn’t anywhere else, it will be completely unique. Is it in the right place? I think it is in the right place, the only place for that particular experience. The trust insists it won’t charge for entry and operating costs will be met through fundraising. The case is expected to be heard in the High Court injune. That’s it for now from me, but let’s find out what the weather’s up to with Wendy Hurrell. Thank you. This is how the day ended across London. Beautiful, clear skies as we go into the night, leading us into a sunny and warm midweek. It will be cold tonight. That cloud cleared away quickly and left us with some decent sunny spells. The rest of that cloud has all cleared now and so through the night, temperatures will fall back, seven degrees in Central London. The countryside might be at three degrees for a time. Those prone spots, you might be dangerously close to freezing. So, it will be a bit of a chilly commute first thing. Apart from a bit of high cloud, as the day goes on, it is going to be a fine and sunny day with light winds and temperatures peaking at 19 or 20 degrees. Look away now if that is the kind of weather you like because this is what we will get on Thursday. It might rain all day and feel chilly. The outlook: The sunshine returns into the weekend. Good evening. It is chilly out there. There is not much sign of heat on my weather charts. If it is hot weather you are after, I will have to take you down to southern parts of Europe and, particularly, to Iberia. These umbrellas were not to protect against the rain! If anything, tomorrow is going to be hotter, temperatures getting up into the 40s in and around Seville - hotter, temperatures getting up into the 40s in and around Seville - too hot for me! Back home, a nip in the air. There could be a frost in some rural parts, even across southern parts of England. Gardeners take note, we could see a touch of frost. A chilly start tomorrow. Plenty of sunshine to look forward to. It won’t be sunny everywhere. There will be some areas of cloud floating around. That will break up. A few showers for a time across the north-east of Scotland. Even these will tend to fade away and we are more or less set fair through the afternoon. 4.00pm, not spectacularly warm, but with strong sunshine and light winds, it should feel very nice. The odd isolated shower perhaps up over the north Pennines. 99% of us will stay dry. Across central and southern areas, it will warm up into the mid to high teens. What a difference on Thursday. A complete transformation. It is going to be cold and bleak and wet for much of the day. Temperatures in some spots will struggle to get into double figures and we could see an inch of rain across this zone. Watch this space. It may brighten up across the far South West. The best of the sunshine on Thursday will be across parts of Northern England, Northern Ireland, particularly Scotland. Nowhere will it be warm. Now, the low pressure responsible won’t hang around, it will die down into the near continent. After a chilly start, a ridge of high pressure will build in again on Friday, so a fine end to the week for many. It does look as if Saturday is going to be fine. Changes again on Sunday. DRAMATIC MUSIC BUILDS It’s a game, innit? And the buzz you get. It’s better than sex, I tell you. All over Britain, a unique breed of entrepreneur is on the make. It’sjust become 100 years old, so it hasjust become an antique. HORN HONKS The flames are beautiful. This will be so easy to sell. For these real life Del Boys, everything and anything is for sale.

51,BBC1 London,15-may-2015,BBC News at One,13:00,40 mins,True,"Face to face, David Cameron and Nicola Sturgeon hold talks in Edinburgh, dominated by demands for further powers for the Scottish Parliament. Their meeting is described as constructive and helpful, on the agenda more powers over business tax, the minimum wage, welfare, and employment law. The Prime Minister agreed he will look at the proposals that we will now send to suggest how we now go and the extent to which and the areas we can go beyond Smith. There was no agreement in terms of the substance. Of course, people want to make further proposals I will get them but I am a great believer that in our United Kingdom we want a strong Scottish Parliament and the solidarity between the different parts of our United Kingdom and I don’t want to lose that. We’ll be live in Edinburgh for the latest. Also this lunchtime. Shock exit, just three days after entering the race to be Labour leader, Chuka Umunna pulls out, blaming the ""sheer pressure"" of the contest. ""I still have phenomenal support"", a defiant Nigel Farage on the bitter row over his leadership of Ukip. Olive Cooke at 92 one of the country’s longest-serving poppy sellers is found dead, apparantly ""exhausted"" by requests for money from different charities. I found that when the people asked me to sing a gospel song they would always praise me. But when someone asked me to sing a blues song they would give me a tip and sometimes a beer. Tributes to the ""King of the Blues"" guitarist and singer BB King, has died at the age of 89. Later on BBC London. A father is jailed for life for murdering his four-year-old daughter at their house in Hatfield. Plus, how’s the weather looking for the weekend ahead? Your local and national forecast is coming up. Good afternoon, and welcome to the BBC News at One. It had the making of a difficult meeting, but in the end the first post-election talks between Prime Minister David Cameron and Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon were described as ""helpful"" and ""constructive"". On the agenda, more powers for Scotland including control over business taxes, employment law, the minimum wage, and welfare. Ms Sturgeon said there was ""no agreement in terms of the substance"" of those plans but said Mr Cameron had agreed to look at them. There is flash photography in this report. Here’s our Scotland correspondent Laura Bicker. just a week after their victory. But when it comes to political standpoints, they could not be more different. Behind the banter for the cameras, can these two really do business? One believes in a United Kingdom, the other is fighting for more control over a nation which considered the question of independence. Yet the two have pledged to find some common ground. The Prime Minister send, to suggest how we go and the extent was no agreement in terms of the substance them and there will be a the first incident between the Getty First Minister and Secretary of State for Scotland, to look how we take that further forward -- State for Scotland, to look how we take that further forward -- between the First Minister. David Cameron has promised to make the Scottish bomb at one of the most powerful devolved parliaments in the world, responsible for 60% of Scottish spending including the power to vary tax rates and bands of tax and some control over welfare. Nicola Sturgeon says this is just a starting point. She wants more powers over welfare, business tax allowances and the minimum wage. This meeting is more than political posturing and photocalls, it is about setting the tone for the next five years and to avoid Westminster becoming two nations divided by one Parliament. Nicola Sturgeon says this is her mandate for change. And election victory unprecedented in Scotland, she has 56 out of 59 possible MPs -- Scotland, she has 56 out of 59 possible MPs -- and election. Of the Prime Minister has a majority at Westminster and for now he says his priority are the powers promised. Let’s get that done first because it does create a really strong Scottish parliament, notjust powers over health and education, those devolved matters but taxing and spending. Let’s get that done. If people want to make further proposals, I will look at them but I am a great believer that in our United Kingdom, we want a strong Scottish parliament but we also want the solidarity between the different parts of our United Kingdom and I don’t want to lose that. Scots were promised this election was never about independence. Nicola Sturgeon pledged it was about getting Scotland’s voice heard. But how keenly David Cameron lessons could ultimately determine whether or not Scots ask themselves once again if their nation should be independent. Let’s speak to our Scotland Political Editor, Brian Taylor. Lau ra Laura mentioned the question in her report, can these two do business together? ~ I think they can and they both face a conundrum. The SNP, the Scottish Government whose First Minister ‘s office quarters are behind me. The SNP has the voice as far as Scotland is concerned but David Cameron has the votes at Westminster neither of them want to pursue representations vigorously. David Cameron does not want to say a flat note for powers to Scotland, perhaps it would look as if he is ignoring the remarkable vote. 56 out of 59 seats going to the SNP -- vote. 56 out of 59 seats going to the SNP -- a flat no. Nicola Sturgeon needs an exit strategy if she pursues demands for further powers and the Prime Minister simply says no. Where does she go? The two will tiptoe forwards fairly cautiously. Trying to see if there is some common ground. To stress the Prime Minister is saying he will look at the possibility of further powers, but he is not saying at this stage with any overt enthusiasm. Thank you. just three days after launching his bid, the Shadow Business Secretary, Chuka Umunna, has pulled out of the race to become Labour leader. He blamed what he called ""the added level of pressure that came with being a leadership candidate"". Something, he said, he had ""not found to be a comfortable experience"". Here’s our political correspondent, Eleanor Garnier. Has says has driven him out of the Labour leadership race distressed at the degree of scrutiny he, his girlfriend and family have come under, since he declared his intention to stand. But as a front runner, his decision has come as a huge shock. I think it’s absolutely tragic. Chuka Umunna had the potential to be a great party leader and Prime Minister. He was the candidate the Conservatives feared the most and if it is as a result of press intrusion into his extended family, that is a very sad indictment on our political age. Announcing his resignation, Chuka Umunna ~ Chuka Umunna launched his leadership campaign with this video on social media. I’m pleased today to be announcing that I will be standing for the leadership of the party. But just three days later, he has pulled out, leaving four left in the race. The shadow international, Mary Craig and Liz Kendall, Labour’s shadow care minister. Yvette Cooper, the Shadow Home Secretary and Andy Burnham, the Shadow Health Secretary. Chuka Umunna had been tipped for the top by some. Seen as bright, young and the potential moderniser for the party. bright, young and the potential moderniserforthe party. Ithink bright, young and the potential moderniser for the party. I think he had a real chance of winning. Although people weren’t quite sure where in the Labour Party Chuka Umunna quite stood, they felt he had some indefinable star quality and he did handle a difficult brief at business very well. He leaves a gap. That will be exploited by somebody else. Already there are questions as to whether there is more behind his dramatic exit from the leadership campaign. Butjustifying his campaign. But justifying his decision, campaign. Butjustifying his decision, Chuka Umunna has told friends"" I’m human, the rest of my life is more important to me than politics"". Nigel Farage says he’s confident he has the full support of his party despite the bitter row over his leadership. He is Ukip’s only MP. He is sometimes talked of as the next party leader. But leaving his London home this morning, Douglas Carswell didn’t want to discuss the vicious infighting of the last 36 hours. I will not... But that wasn’t the case in Kent, where Nigel Farage survives as leader. He was pointing the finger, twice, in an interview. There is one seniorfigure in Ukip briefing, every single day, consistently and he has now moved onto, ""There must be a leadership election"". And that individual must make his mind up whether his future is with Ukip or not. There is one person within Ukip agitating for a change and for a leadership election. He hasn’t had the courage to break cover. He must make his mind up, is his future with Ukip or not? He didn’t name names, but it’s safe to say he was talking about Douglas Ca rswell. This was the two of them last year in seemingly happier times, after he quit the Tories and was on the road to becoming Ukip’s first elected MP. The two have been at odds over whether to accept hundreds of thousands of pounds in public money that Ukip is now due, after the election. There has also been a difference of opinion on personnel at the top of the party, advising Nigel Farage. On both of those issues, it seems Douglas Carswell has won the day. This is one of the senior advisers criticised as aggressive and inexperienced. In private, he has talked of a coup in Ukip and on camera he is still defending his ex-boss. What these people who are making these accusations are saying is that they doubt Nigel Farage’s leadership and I don’t doubt that at all. I fully back Nigel Farage as leader of Ukip, he is a fantastic leader of the party and I hope he continues to lead the party for now, through the European referendum campaign and furthermore. The Ukip leader’s decision to resign last week and then un-resign is at the centre of all of this turmoil. Even loyal party figures think he should have gone straight off on a summer break. The worst of the row appears to have passed. Nigel Farage remains at the top. But his style during the election being intentionally provocative has now been attacked by some of Ukip’s most senior figures. Tributes have been coming in for Britain’s oldest poppy seller, who was found dead at the bottom of the Avon Gorge near Bristol. Olive Cooke was just 16 when she started collecting for the Royal British Legion. Bristol’s Lord Mayor called the 92 year old ""a city treasure"". Well our correspondent’s in Bristol, jon Kay. Olive Cooke would sit in the cathedral with a Bronco over her lap and a beret, every winter selling those poppies. -- and a beret, every winter selling those poppies. -- with a blanket. As well as tributes there are questions surrounding the way in which she died. Every November she would come to Bristol Cathedral and set up her little store.

She did it party to remember her husband who was killed in the Second World War. -- remember her husband who was killed in the Second World War. -- partly to remember.

You shouldn’tjust be thinking in words all the time, about ourselves. -- thinking in words all the time, about ourselves. -- thinking inward. There is so much need in this world. We can at least offer some help. But there are now concerned that Olive’s eagerness to help others may have contributed to her death. Earlierthis help others may have contributed to her death. Earlier this month her body was found in the Avon Gorge, close to the Clifton suspension Bridge. It appears she has taken her own life. Family and friends say the 92-year-old had a number of worries in the months before she died, including health concerns. But she also complained to her local newspaper about the pressure she felt from charities, sending her letters, asking for money. It was getting too much for her, the letters were constant. Olive’s friend, Michael, told me one month she received more than 200 different charity appeals through the post and she couldn’t help but give to some of them. How many of these direct debits did she have? 27. That is a lot. £30, £50 pertime. She would give that much? Yes, they weren’t pennies. She would give all of her money to charity, sometimes, what she got from her pension, she would give that away. Olive’s devotion to the Royal British Legion has recently been recognised with a special reward. She was a lovely person. Whenever you saw her face or met her, she always had a smile. Her friends say the wider issues of charities sending out letters does need to be addressed. Charities need the money, we all need the money. But if you are not earning, you are elderly and on an old age pension, there is a limit to what you can give. Olive Cooke’s family are too upset to speak publicly, they have confirmed that charity letters may have contributed to her state of mind. But they stressed they were not the only factor. This lunchtime, her MP has said that she will speak with the Charity commission about letters that are received from charities, there will be an inquest to determine all of the facts surrounding her death and there will be a funeral, some of her friends have suggested to me that the cathedral here, where she would sell her poppies every year, in a dispute over pay. Who is this going to affect? It is going to affect millions of travellers, this will be for 21+ hours, from 5pm, bank on a day Monday, Network Rail say there is normally 3 million journeys taken on bank holiday Monday, 1+.5 million journeys taken the following day, when everyone returns to work. This strike will struggle both days, it will have a serious impact, it is going to affect maintenance work, there is a 1+8-hour overtime ban. Big disruption designed to have maximum impact, this is a dispute over pay. And also over the union wanting guarantees over redundancy. Some good news in the last few minutes, more talks. Both sides in this work claiming they wanted to talk, nothing was happening, in the last few minutes it has been confirmed there will be talks on Monday. Many people see this as the first big industrial relations challenge for this Tory government, and Steve Hadley, of the RMT union, speaking with the BBC, he believes that there has been political interference in all of this, he specifically said, ""maybe David Cameron feels he wants to take on the trade unions and make an example of the RMT."" We have put that Network Rail, they have denied there had been any political interference whatsoever, just to recapture talks at ACAS beginning on Monday morning. -- recapture talks at ACAS beginning on Monday morning. -- just to recap, talks at ACAS beginning on Monday morning.

In sport, denial about Kevin Pietersen being deceived about a possible return to international duty, that from Colin One of the world’s oldest and most important archaelogical cities is under threat from the so-called Islamic State. Palmyra in Syria was first inhabited four thousand years ago but IS fighters are now said to be about a mile or so from what is a World Heritage site. Archaeologists say they fear a ""cultural catastrophe"" because in the past IS has destroyed ancient sites claiming they’re ""idolatrous"". Here’s our world affairs correspondent, Richard Galpin. this ancient city has stood in the central Syria desert the thousands of years, lying on the ancient silk Route, it evolved from a trading town into a prosperous Roman city. Now, this archaeological treasure is under threat. Militants from the group calling itself Islamic State launched an offensive in the area this week, and are now reported to be within a few miles of the ancient city. Their initial target, thought to be important Syrian military bases nearby. A top United Nations cultural official currently visiting the Middle East has expressed her alarm. The news is alarming, I appealed yesterday to all parties concerned to protect Palmyra, and leave it outside of the military activity. Over the past year, the Islamic State militants have systematically looted and destroyed important archaeological sites, in areas where they have seized control, in both Syria and Iraq. Proudly filming the destruction, for its propaganda value, as they try to eliminate all traces of the region’s pre-Islamic history. And now, Palmyra could be next. Specialists like Diana, who has been to Palmyra many times, says the site is absolutely unique. It is a blend of cultures which I find particularly fascinating, the reason it is unique, because it is Rome lending with everything oriental, to the east of it, early Babylonian, Mesopotamian, Persian, and the Greek and Roman cultures mixing with that. So far, the Islamic State militants have not managed to reach Palmyra, Syrian troops, at least for now, keeping them away, from this, one of the world ‘s most important historical sites. STUDIO: The United Nations has urged Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysis not to push boats carrying migrants back out to sea describing the policy as ""appalling"". The comments came after about eight-hundred illegal migrants arrived in Indonesia -- many of them Muslims fleeing persecution in Myanmar. Some viewers may find images in jonathan Head’s report disturbing. The crisis was precipitated by the decision of the Thai authorities much demanded over many years, I should say, to move against the trafficking rings in Thailand, who basically operated the main route for all of these thousands of people fleeing the unmarked, some coming from Bangladesh, to get to Malaysia, which is where they want to go, they have always gone through Thailand, they have been horribly abused, that is how they get into Malaysia. That has been shut down, and so the smugglers running the boats did not want to wa nt to land drifted around for a few weeks, and in the case of the boat we found yesterday, they were simply abandoned. Others are trying to make their own way, as you heard this morning, down to who knows how to operate of them were clearly in need of inexperienced hands in the open sea.

Early in the year, when it came out, national savings website and phone service creaked a bit, no doubt they were worried and so they have brought more people in. Briefly, some people have complained pensioners are getting too much of a giveaway. Hangs and building societies have watched billions go out of accounts, others have said it is wrong for the taxpayer to subsidise this, but the Chancellor’s answer has been, borrowers, particularly mortgage borrowers, have the benefit of very low interest rates and this is something extra for savers. Dozens of British beaches and lakes including some of our most popular are at risk of failing to meet tougher European water quality standards this summer. The Environment Agency says the new European regulations are twice as hard to pass as our Environment Correspondent Claire Marshall now explains. There is only one person braving the sea at Teignmouth today, an Environment Agency official doing the first water quality test of the summer. New European standards have come into force, and this beach could well fail the much tougher tests. The main problems we have are agricultural run-off from the fields and cows in the streams, and the urban rubbish that comes off our streets and driveways. This will provide a snapshot that the tourist can’t get. What the water looks like at a microbiological level. The vast majority of English beaches are clean. Last year, more than 99% made the grade, but this is forecast to drop by 6%. The waters of 25 beaches may well be too polluted, for example, with E Coli. Much of the purifying has to be done by water companies. Will tougher standards mean higher bills? We have already invested a huge amount in the bathing waters, if you look at our previous investment. We are talking about another £20 million to achieve these standards. There is virtually no significant impact on the bill at all for these extra standards. The test results will be published online as they come in. One of the most influential guitarists in music history, BB King, has died at the age of 89. With his blues guitars, which he always called Lucille, he influenced generations of musicians including Eric Clapton and jimi Hendrix. Nick Higham looks back at the life and music of the ‘King of the Blues’. BB King was the genuine article, a real bluesman, straight from the Mississippi Delta. He first heard raw blues hollered from workers in the cotton fields around his home and at the age of 11+ he bought himself a guitar. He started singing gospel, but not for long. I found that when people asked me to sing gospel songs they would always praise me. But when they asked me to play the blues they would give me a tip and sometimes a beer! I don’t have to tell you where the motivation comes from(!) Wiley got a job on a Memphis radio station, began recording in 191+9 and set off on a tour which never really stopped, still playing digs into his 80s.

You are watching the BBC news at one, top story today: David Cameron and Nicola Sturgeon hold talks in Edinburgh, dominated by demands for further powers for the Scottish parliament. Ina moment In a moment we will have the weather forecast, but first, with all of the days sport, Hugh Colin rejected claims that Kevin Pietersen was deceived about claims of a possible international recall, our reporter is at Lord’s, this saga is refusing to go away. It does, and it does not seem like it is going to go away any time soon, this is a very short honeymoon period for Colin Graves, and was meant to start as the man responsible for transforming the English cricket, but he has to deal with this Kevin Pietersen issue that continues to linger. We were told by him that there was a statement due from the ECB, clarifying the matter, it is my understanding that Colin Graves strongly refuted Kevin Pietersen’s suggestion that the ECB had been deceitful in their reasons for not allowing him back into the frame. And that he offered no guarantees to Kevin Pietersen about a return to the England team. That statement was meant to come at 12pm, as you see, from Colin Graves himself. What is your reaction to what has been happening at the moment with the Kevin Pietersen issue and everything else? There is a statement coming out in the next ten minutes... You will see my reaction. Is the door closed on Kevin Pietersen? That is the question every blue monster no. You will see my statement. Thank you very much for your time. We we re We were told it would be a blog from Colin Graves, what was told to staff in a meeting at Lord’s but we have not received that. Confusion reigns of English cricket and the issue of Kevin Pietersen won’t go away. There have been suggestions that Captain Alastair Cook played a large part in the suggestion not to recall Pietersen, can you tell us about that? That is following a report in the Daily Telegraph that Alastair Cook was the main obstacle barring a return for Kevin Pietersen. If Alastair Cook fell out of form, lost the captaincy, could Kevin Pietersen could come back? That seems to be an issue for Andrew Strauss, the ECB’s director of cricket and Colin Graves. We are no closer to knowing and England play New Zealand next week on Thursday at Lord’s without Kevin Pietersen. Thanks. We will move on to football. For the first time ever in English manager has leg the Champions League, Colin Bell has led Frankfurt to victory in the women’s Champions League final, beating PSG 2-1. It was 1-1 after 90 minutes and seemed destined to go to extra time before the French side were stunned in Berlin. Really unbelievable, when you think about the top names at the top coaches that have worked and are working in professionalfootball. This unknown Colin Bell is the first English guy... To be in the Champions League final and to win it. I don’t know what to say, I am so grateful. That is all of the sport, back to you. It is meant to explore the special character and unique qualities of Essex but critics are calling at the gingerbread house. Grayson Perry built the holiday home in the a village, and he said he wanted it to resemble a jewel box that told the story of a mythical Essex woman called julie and today it opened its stores to the public. This is Grayson Perry’s house in Essex. It is more thanjust an architectural oddity. It also tells a story about a fictional character called julie. The story is told by all the objects and the house which Grayson Perry’s made. You can see a picture ofjulie here. Let me show you more inside. If you give Grayson Perry a Grand Design sort of brief, you are going to get a hands-on Gretel type of concept. -- you are going to get a Hanzel and Gretel type of concept. Here is julie’s kitchen. Here you can see her again with her name in these tiles. Nice views out the window, nice view of the kitchen, and a kind of secret door here. It goes into this vaulted living room, a bit like a schoolroom. Here is julie’s story written large. It is told through two tapestries. The first one showsjulie being born on the night of the great flood. In the 70s, she gets married to Dave, he is a bit of a rogue. It does not go down well. She picks herself up. And she remarries Rob, much steadier and a better union. But then tragedy strikes when she is hit by a motorbike and killed. The same motorbike that is above my head acting as a chandelier. Also Grayson Perry’s statue ofjulie. This is a wild and weird house. It is a house full of stories and narrative. Now thatjulie no longer lives here, it is available for anybody to rent. It begs the question, should more artists make houses? Not everybody is going to like it. It looks extremely strange on the landscape, but everybody I spoke to in the local community seems very enthusiastic. A positive outcome to a story yesterday. Two pet dogs belonging to the Hollywood actorjohnny Depp are on a flight to the United States, after the government threatened to have them put down for breaching quarantine regulations. Depp flew into Australia last month on his private jet and failed to put his two Yorkshire Terriers Pistol and Boo, in quarantine. He’s been accused by the Agriculture Minister of smuggling the dogs into the country. It’s said to be longer than a double decker bus and weighs over 130lbs. This massive 20 foot long eel was caught by fishermen off the coast of Devon. But despite the huge catch the fishjust missed out on a UK record for the largest ever, it fetched only £1+0 at today’s market in Plymouth. You should see the butterfly hiding behind Louise.

53,BBC News 24,15-may-2015,BBC News at Six,18:00,30 mins,True,"The first meeting between the Prime Minister and the SNP since the election, and more powers to Scotland are on the agenda. The Prime Minister says Scotland will be given greater control over spending- and he’s prepared to consider further proposals by the SNP. There will be a Scotland Bill in the first Queen’s Speech and let’s be clear about what this does, it gives massive tax and spending powers to the Scottish parliament. What was significant today and very welcome is that there is a willingness to look at the proposals we now make. But while new powers WILL be considered for Scotland, a fresh a fresh independence referendum was not up for discussion. Also tonight. The desperate situation on board the ships full of migrants abandoned and adrift off the coast of South-East Asia. Chuka Umunna pulls out of the contest to be the new Labour leader, blaming unwelcome scrutiny of those close to him. The Thrill is gone, tributes to the Blues legend BB King, who has died aged 89. And the house that Grayson built, the holiday home causing a stir Tonight on BBC London. The mayor’s plan to limit the number of minicabs to help ease congestion - critics say it’ll mean higher prices. And how commuters face bank holiday travel disruption as unions announce a 24 hour strike. more powers for the Scottish Parliament. And the former News of the World editor Andy Coulson goes on trial on perjury charges. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. The Prime Minister says he will consider giving more powers to Scotland over and above those already agreed before the general election. After talks today with the SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, David Cameron confirmed his pledge to introduce changes allowing the Scottish Government to take control of income and some welfare spending. Ms Sturgeon is calling for further powers over other areas. Mr Cameron says he is prepared to look at ""sensible suggestions"". It was the first meeting between the two leaders since the SNP swept the board in Scotland at last week’s election. Our Scotland correspondent james Cook reports. Another sunny day! The weather is 1 of the few things they agree on. These 2 politicians do not see eye to eye. 1 Unionist, the other nationalist, 1 Tory, 1 social Democrat, pushed together by an election in which both could claim victory. David Cameron and Nicola Sturgeon and talked for an hour, it was said to be businesslike, if not friendly. What was significant and very welcome was a willingness to look at the proposals we have made. The ball is in the Court of David Cameron. He can decide to ignore the voice of Scottish people and people can draw their own conclusions about Westminster ‘s ability to serve Scotland better all he can respond positively. In this very room last year a package of new powers for Scotland was agreed. The question todayis Scotland was agreed. The question today is whether David Cameron is prepared to go further. He says he will have a look but does not sound very keen. The choice is what sort of future for Scotland in the UK. My vision is of a strong Parliament, with increased powers, one of the strongest parliaments in the world but I would not want to seize cottage taxpayers loaded with extra cuts and extra taxes because of another agenda. cuts and extra taxes because of anotheragenda. So another agenda. So where is always heading? The powers already promised to the Scottish Parliament include control over the rates and bands of income tax, a slice of revenue from VAT, and air passenger duty. The powers now demanded go further. They include national insurance contributions the ability to vary the minimum wage, and to set a separate corporation tax rate in Scotland. There is now a thirst for more powers among both opponents and supporters of independence. In this cafe Mike voted no in the referendum, his son in law Scott said yes but like many voters now Pope want change. -- they change. We ways. We both and I think we can agree that more although I would like to see more than your! More powers, complete control of the fiscal budget, raising VAT, spending our money. I do think we have to respect that there was a referendum and there was a decision on that. Having said that, I do not a decision on that. Having said that, Ido not think things should stay as they are. I think a large majority of people in Scotland do want change. When any change might happen is not clear and four David Cameron, staying in control of this process will be delicate and difficult. Brian Taylor is our Scotland political editor. A very important meeting and two leaders coming at it with different motivations. Also coming at it both cautiously. David Cameron said he was willing to listen but I cannot see him peering at the prospect, to borrow another phrase! He could employ his House of Commons majority to legislate for Scotland as he chooses but he knows the sensible and moderate thing to do is to be aware of those vote sweeping gains with the NSP at the election. Nicola Sturgeon will equally proceed with caution. She has all those MPs behind her in her team, David Cameron is the UK majority, he has the votes while she perhaps has the voice of Scotland. She will not want to preserve the date and early crisis in these discussions because the exit would further will not be obviously discernible. She will exercise caution, and exercise, if you like coming in competing mandates. Labour’s Chuka Umunna has pulled out of the contest to be the next Labour leader, following Ed Miliband’s resignation. The Shadow Business Secretary was considered by the bookies to be a frontrunner for the job. But Mr Umunna said that since becoming a candidate for party leader, the pressure on him and the level of scrutiny of those close to him had prompted him to reconsider. Here’s our political correspondent, Ben Wright. On Tuesday, she was in. -- he was in. But today he’s out. A campaign launched on new media, scrapped committee claimed, after pressure from old media. Young, sharp, slick, Chuka Umunna was a top contender for the Labour Party ‘s top jobs Chuka Umunna was a top contender for the Labour Party ‘s topjobs in his statement today Westminster. In it, he said that since the might of their defeat last week he had been subject to the added level of pressure that came with being a leadership candidate and have not founded a comfortable experience. Friends of the Shadow Business Secretary say that his girlfriend and family have come under in tolerable scrutiny since he decided to stand, with reporters camped outside their homes. This committee thought, was not the future he wanted. It is absolutely tragic comic he had the potential to be a great leader, a great Prime Minister, the candidate the Conservatives feared most. If it is as a result of pressure in Trish and into his extended family it is a sad indictment of our age. He’s been in the public eye for years committee must have thought about what the contest would involve, Des ‘s explanation stack up? Ido not think that anyone not in public life appreciates the level of intrusion that happens if you put yourself forward for a job like this. The former City lawyer has been the MP for Streatham since 2010 and is seen a modernising candidate. One seasoned newspaper man says he should have expected the scrutiny. It is only when you are under fire as he has been in the last few days that use the watt metal people are made of and he has melted. Is it a loss? It might have been an early indication for Labour. A difficult, disorientating week at Labour headquarters, the scale of the election defeat greater than anyone expected and many in the party will be dismayed that Chuka Umunna has taken his hat out the ring, leaving at the moment four candidates facing a campaign and the the future of the party. No damaging story is about to appear in the papers say friends of Chuka Umunna, and he will still play a front-line role. Party leader come he thinks, is too soon, too much to lose, so for now, he’s walking away. After a week of vicious in-fighting inside the UK Independence Party, its leader Nigel Farage has called on one unnamed critic to put up, shut up or go. Mr Farage insists he has massive support within the party and claimsjust a handful of people are ""agitating for change"". The party got nearly A million votes in the general election last week but only managed to get one MP elected. The United Nations has accused countries in South East Asia of ""incomprehensible and inhumane"" treatment of around 6,000 migrants, who are stranded at sea. Most of them are ethnic Rohingya. There are more than a million of them in Myanamar, formerly known as Burma. The UN has described them as one of the world’s most persecuted peoples. Thousands have boarded smugglers’ boats, in search of a better life. Now many are stranded at sea in desperate conditions, with countries including Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia turning most of them away. Our correspondent jonathan Head has been following one overloaded boat for two days. His report contains some distressing images. A fishing boat crammed with migrants off the coast of Thailand. We found them yesterday, leading for water. They had been R. There are, they not even as citizens. -- R. There are, they not even as citizens. -- Myahnmar. They were given supplies by the Thai navy, setting off a frantic scene, but early this morning they vanished. Only one journalist witnessed the departure of the boat. He was allowed by the Thailand military to observe them as they boarded the boat and repaired its broken engine. Thai officials insist that the passengers wanted to move on, not stay in Thailand. The journalist got a very different impression. She filmed the appallingly cramped conditions in which they lived. Some of them were clearly in need of medical treatment. of them were clearly in need of medicaltreatment. Many appeared of them were clearly in need of medical treatment. Many appeared to be half starved. As the crew had abandoned the boat, Thai navy officers showed and trained men how to operate it. It seemed dangerously ill prepared for a long sea journey. But it was as she spent time with the women and children, more than half the passengers that the journalist realised that many on board did not want to leave. TRANSLATION: The women, children, and some men came to me, crying, holding my hand. Ifelt and some men came to me, crying, holding my hand. I felt strongly that they needed help. They did not want to go. They had no idea where they were going. I am certain that everyone wanted to move on again. The boat got underway at sunrise, heading not to nearby Malaysian but to Indonesia, a full day of sailing, and whether they made it, we do not know. Nor do we know if the Indonesians will accept them, or like the Thai people, send them out to sea again.

The family of one of Britain’s longest-serving poppy sellers, who was found dead in the Avon Gorge last week, say one of the factors in the suspected suicide of 92-year-old Olive Cooke may have been that she was overwhelmed by the hundreds of letters she received from charities asking for donations. Her local MP says she will be contacting the Charities Commission about the case. jon Kay reports. How long have you been doing this? Every November she set up a stall at Bristol Cathedral. Olive Cooke, a POPPY Bristol Cathedral. Olive Cooke, a poppy seller for more than 70 years. I was 18 and a half. She did it to remember her husband killed in the Second World War but also for live, charity was everything. It is important to care for others. We should notjust be thinking in woods all the time, of ourselves, because there is much need in this world -- thinking inwardly. There are no concerns that her eagerness to help others may have contributed to her death. Her body was found in the Avon Gorge, close to the Clifton suspension Bridge. It appears she had taken her own life. Family and friends say the 92-year-old had a number of worries in the months before she died including health concerns but she had also complained to her local newspaper about pressure she felt from charities sending her letters asking for money. It was getting too much for her. The letters were constant. Her friend Michael said that one month she received over 200 different charity appeals through the post. How many direct debits titchy have? 27. -- How many direct debits titchy have? 27. -- did she have. 30 or Âl+0. They were not pennies. She gave all her money to charities sometimes.

She was a lovely person. Her friends say people need more protection from fundraisers. When people send out something from a charity asking for help they don’t know if it is going to an old age pensioner or two a 22-year-old. Olive’s family say charity letters may have contributed to her state of mind, but stressed that there were other factors. Her friends say that this would be a fitting place for his funeral, the computer where she raised so much money through the poppies -- computer where she raised so much money through the poppies -- for the funeral, the Cathedral where she raised so much money. Our top story this evening. David Cameron and Nicola Sturgeon have held talks in Edinburgh over proposals to hand over extra powers to the Scottish Parliament. And how clean are Britain’s beaches? Why the rules over water quality are about to become much tougher. Later on BBC London. The plan to knock down these historic buildings to create a modern development - the proposal is blocked by the government. And London’s latest technology success story - we look at how the capital is leading the way in digital design. about doping in the Scottish game. And we meet the contestants at the Scottish Kennel Club Championships at Ingliston. Tributes from around the world have been paid to the guitarist BB King, who has died aged 89. Dubbed the King of the Blues, he worked as a cotton picker as a child. But the gift of a guitar changed his life and he went on to influence generations of musicians - including Eric Clapton and jimi Hendrix. Nick Higham looks back at his life. BB King was the real deal, almost the last of the authentic Mississippi Delta blues man. He was a sharecropper’s son who first heard raw blues hollered in the cotton fields around his home. He started out singing gospel music but not for long. Ifound that out singing gospel music but not for long. I found that when the people asked me to sing a gospel song usually, they would always praise me. That somebody would ask me to play and sing the blues and they would always give me a tip and sometimes a beer. I don’t have to tell you what the motivation was. He was a superb musician but also an entertainer. This concert was filmed in a New York prison and shows his rapport with an audience. # I gave you seven children # And now you want to give them back and # To start with, he played only to black audiences in segregated America but by 1969, he was supporting the Rolling Stones are the US tour. They remained devotees. He is a giant in the 20th century, like Ray Charles, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington and people like that. He stood out like that, in his own career. Massively high and really loved. I’m getting a bit emotional. He played with a distinctive vibrato, the notes shimmering, often wilfully bent. He influenced an entire generation of rock guitarists, Eric Clapton, playing here alongside him, was another admirer. His music is almost a thing of the past now. There are not many left that play in the pure way that BB King did. He was a beacon for all of us who love this kind of music. I thank him from the bottom of my heart. Three years ago, he played the White House and the president sang along. # Sweet home Chicago. # Today, President Obama said America had lost a legend and predicted one killer blues session in haven’t a night. -- killer blues session in haven’t a night. -- in heaven tonight. BB King brought down barriers and brought the blues to a wider audience and broughtjoy to the blues to a wider audience and brought joy to generations. BB King, whose death in Las Vegas was announced this morning. He was 89. Network Rail workers - that’s signalling and maintenance staff- are to stage a 2lI-hour strike on Bank Holiday Monday in a dispute over pay. Let’s speak to our industry correspondent, john Moylan who’s at Waterloo station for us now. This is not what rail passengers want to hear. Know, and they claim is it is going to bring places like this to a standstill. It would be the first national rail strike in 20 years. There are something like 3 millionjourneys on bank years. There are something like 3 million journeys on bank holiday Monday, 1+.5 million on the Tuesday when everyone returns to work. This 21+-hour strike is going to straddle both days and cause a lot of impact. Little wonder that today it was condemned by the Transport Secretary, described as deplorable by Network Rail. What is at issue is a four-year pay deal. The union is also seeking guarantees there will be no compulsory doesn’t cease in that period. If anything, the union’s and was strengthened when a second union confirmed its members had voted for strike action. The good news is that both sides in this dispute will meet at Acas on Monday morning to try to get a resolution. Dozens of British beaches - including some of our most popular - are at risk of failing tougher European water quality standards this summer. The Environment Agency says the new European regulations will be twice as hard to pass as before. Our environment correspondent Claire Marshall is in Weston-Super-Mare in Somerset for us. Yes, it is a nerve wracking time for businesses who depend on these beaches to bringing tourists when the sun comes out. This one at Weston-Super-Mare is at risk of being classified as polluted. The results will go up online. It is tested every week and you can check to see whether you fancy getting in for a dip. There’s only one person braving the sea at Teignmouth today, an Environment Agency official doing the first water quality test of the summer. New European standards have now come into force, and this speech could well fail the much tougher tests. The main problems we have got our agricultural run-off from fields and cows in streams, the sewers which sometimes overflow from combined storm overflows and from urban drainage which comes off the streets and driveways. So this sample will provide a snapshot but the tourist can’t get, just what the water looks like at a microbiological bevel. It comes here, to this lab near Exeter. The looking for is only be half of what 25 English beaches may now fail, Mike Teignmouth, where pigeon mess makes things worse. What do you think about the water quality? It is fine. I’ve never had any problems. I come down here, maybe once a fortnight, once a week. It looks a bit murky but it does not bother me. It would be nice to know it is safe to swim. Would you not come here? Oh, no, Ilove to swim. Would you not come here? Oh, no, I love it. It’s nice. to swim. Would you not come here? Oh, no, Ilove it. It’s nice. Seen from the air, English beaches look clean and they are cleaner than ever. Last year, more than 99% made the grade. The good news for holiday- makers is that the grade. The good news for holiday-makers is that now holiday- makers is that now they will need to be even better. Claire Marshall, BBC News, Teignmouth. He’s one of Britain’s most colourful artists. So when Turner Prize winner Grayson Perry was asked to design a holiday home, it was never going to be ordinary. The so-called Gingerbread House on the Essex Coast is, admits the artist, a little ""bonkers"". Some locals love it. Others have branded it an abomination. Our arts editor Will Gompertz went to have a look. Well, what did you expect? Race and Perry does not do shy and retiring. He does this come to Berlin and eccentric. Disney meets Salvador Dali with a bit of Russian bar rock thrown in. This is the Taj Mahal of the River Stour. Appropriate? That’s not a word I worry about! LAUGHTER Yes, it is kitsch but also, in its own way thoughtful. This is more thanjust a house of own way thoughtful. This is more than just a house of fun. thanjust a house of fun. It is a shrine to 1+0 female intelligence. Embodied byjulie, a mythical Essex Everywoman around his imagined story Grayson Perry has designed and decorated the house. The ceiling is six snapshots, one for each decade of her life. The tapestries are the first and second acts. And be first and second narratives. And then this is the second marriage. This is when she found true happiness, in the second marriage. But tragedy strikes. Here she is, lying dead with her social worker’s badge around her neck, having been struck by a career delivery mode bed in Colchester high Street. Which is? Hanging from the ceiling, the instrument of her demise as a chandelier. A central, Madonna like figuraljulie is embracing the world but also, her own mortality, perhaps. What do the real women of the county think? I would like to think that maybe Essex girls are interesting. It does not matter how many times you look at the house, you can see something different. I would like to think that every time you speak to us, you see something different, too. Not everyone is as enthusiastic. It is really not in keeping with this part of Essex. I know there is believed to be a story behind it but it bears no resemblance whatsoever to anything that has happened in this part of Essex. Is the artist bothered by those who object to his rural retreat? I would those who object to his rural retreat? Iwould be retreat? I would be worried if I did not have an element of Marmite about mY not have an element of Marmite about my work. If everybody liked it, if you want to be successful, be authentically bland. No one is going to accuse him of being that. Whether you think it is a blot on the landscape or a modern masterpiece, it is an unmissable work of art and architecture. Will Gompertz, BBC News. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Tomasz Schafernaker. Good evening, the weekend is looking pretty fresh for most of us with a bit of a wash in the air and a zing in Scotland with showers and sunshine. But for most across the southern two thirds of the country, it should not be too bad if we get some sunshine. We have got some clouds approaching from the west right now. They have given some rain in north-western parts of the country. You can see they are heading eastwards which means the sunshine we have got right now across the East will fade away and overnight, it turns cloudy and murky with bits and pieces of rain. It is not going to be a cold night in England and Wales, ten or 11 first thing in the morning on Saturday but for Scotland and Northern Ireland, with that fresh air coming out of the north Atlantic, it is going to be a chilly start. Quite fresh winds blowing in here, with some showers which could be wintry across the hills. But for England and Wales, it is looking quite sunny with the best temperatures traditionally in the south-east up to 18 Celsius. On Saturday evening, the theme continues. Showers in the north and for the South, sunny spells. As far as Sunday is concerned, a bit of a split with the north of the country with the weather fronts pushed in on quite a strong jet stream. Rain on the way, in fact, from the morning onwards, lots of showers and a strong wind. In the Scottish hills, for walkers it will be quite chilly but in the southern strip, we should keep dry weather with temperatures in the mid-to high teens in London. Things are set to change. I will show you a sneak peek of next week’s weather with the jet stream right over us and when you get this kind of setup, cool air comes in from the north and there will be plenty showers and the week ahead is looking changeable. But let’s enjoy it anyway. A reminder of our main story. David Cameron and Nicola Sturgeon have held talks in Edinburgh about proposals to hand over extra powers to the Scottish Parliament. That’s all from the BBC News at Six, so it’s goodbye from me. On BBC One, we nowjoin the BBC’s news teams where you are. Tonight on BBC London News.

Good evening and welcome to the programme with me, Alice Bhandhukravi. There’s a warning tonight that the Mayor’s plan to curb the number of minicabs in London will mean higher prices for passengers and fewerjobs for drivers.

The reality is beer is not the amount of work for all these drivers and many of them are convinced that certain apps are promising them thousands a week and many are earning minimum wage. While those in the Black Caps don’t mind the promise many in the target promise do not. This afternoon, Uber said the cap was a limit on choice and said it would mean... They are only 8000 buses in London and 25,000 caps but 75,000 private hire vehicles. That has a significant impact on congestion particularly in busy areas. But cabbies have the own description of transport for London and it is not exactly complementary. They remain a sceptical bunch. I have been saying this for years. Do you reckon it will happen this time? No. The Mayor says a lot, doesn’t he? Lots more to come including: Leading the way in digital design - we hear about London’s latest success story in mobile technology. Five Metropolitan police officers have been sacked after the misconduct hearing today. Our correspondentjoins us misconduct hearing today. Our correspondent joins us with more details. These were police officers working in Camden at the time and what the misconduct panel erred was that they had posted images which were taken corporately of colleagues and members of the public, and posted them on social media sites, and as part of these images they put comments which the misconduct panel described as disrespectful and in one case predatory. That behaviour was described by the Department for professionalism at Scotland Yard as disgraceful and she said it is only right and just that they have been dismissed. In addition, another officer resigned in December and a seventh has been given a final written warning. This all follows events last year where the officers from the diplomatic protection group, the guards at places like Buckingham Palace and Downing Street, three officers were sacked for sending extreme pornography on their mobile phones. More now on the rail strike set to affect services on Bank Holiday Monday. All rail routes in and out of the capital are expected to be disrupted by the industrial action. Services could also be hit on the first day back to work after the long weekend. Louisa Preston now who is in Guildford with more on this. Yes, if this strike goes ahead it will be the first of its kind in the more than 20 years. As you say, this was planned to start on bank holiday Monday at 5pm and will run for 24 hours. This will cause maximum disruption because of the Lafayette people coming back from being away and it will cause maximum disruption on the Tuesday morning for commuters trying to get into London. The RMT union are walking out, signallers and maintenance staff and station workers, overa and maintenance staff and station workers, over a dispute over pay. I have been here all day at Guildford talking to commuters and this is what they have been saying. It is disgusting because the charge enough as it is for us to get to work and are now causing more problems by going on strike. They have chosen those days to be most inconvenient to most people so I am upset they would take that attitude. It is not the fault of the people on the ground but the people on the top who are probably getting above inflation PHY are probably getting above inflation pay rises, shall we say? What are the unions saying? I have been speaking to them today and they told me they do not take this action lightly but they really do believe these members deserve better. They are trying to keep everybody safe and maintenance work is an important job. They are also working in all weather and deserve better. Network Rail said the offer they put forward is clear but the unions say it does not go far enough. We know there are going to be talks to try to avert the strike and we will have to see what happens but pressure is building. We know the London business leaders are saying that if the strike goes ahead it will have an impact on a global scale. More than half a million commuters going to London every day. The pressure is on and we will have to see what happens. Relentless and sadistic to a horrifying degree - that’s how a judge described the violence of a father who killed his four-year-old daughter. Carl Wheatley beat Alexa-Marie Quinn to death last year. He’d fought to get custody of the child as a way of claiming more benefits. But he subjected her to weeks of abuse, and she suffered more than 60 injuries, dying of internal injuries. Today, Wheatley was jailed for life. Sarah Harris was in court. She was described by her family as a wonderful, loving little girl, beautiful on the inside and out, but four-year-old Alexa spent the last days of her life being beaten to death by her own father. Carl Wheatley was given a life sentence today for her murder. In an interview with Hertfordshire police, he was unwilling to explain the 66 injuries visible all over her little body. Describe it to me, tell me when, tell me where, tell me how you did it. Carl Wheatley had put on a show of the caring father for social workers who trusted him with his daughter, after two happy years for Alexa living with a foster family where she had made good progress. It was a different story behind closed doors where they lived in Hartfield. The judge said there was no doubt this was a sadistic violence, relentless and sadistic to a horrifying degree. The man in charge of the police investigation said it was a fair sentence given the suffering he had caused. The last days and weeks of that little girl’s life must have been horrendous. He was relatively new to her and the one person who should have been protecting her was assaulting her to the point where she died. The last ten days of her life must have been filled with suffering and fear. In a statement, Hertfordshire County Council said children’s welfare was paramount. They said there would be a full independent review and they would welcome any findings and recommendations on how to improve the service. Alexa’s family said knowing Carl Wheatley would spend at least 21 years behind bars did serve some justice but nothing would ever bring back their precious angel. A teenager is in a critical condition after being attacked by a large group of men in Islington last night. Police were called to Hall Street just before 7pm to find the victim, believed to be 18, with serious head and stab injuries. It’s thought he was attacked in Hermit Street, while with his friend, who was unhurt in the attack. A woman has been arrested on suspicion of fundraising for terrorism. Terrorism Command detained the 42-year-old this morning at a home in West London. She’s been taken to a central London police station.

Blippar has linked up with some of the world’s leading brands. It’s now attracted millions of pounds of investment and is the latest digital success story to originate in London. Here’s Marc Ashdown.

And right now it’s hot, named 16th in the global list of small players making big waves in the tech world. It’s a major communications medium and it’s almost bringing us closer to be human. It’s just making something we have always wanted to do, look at stuff. And it’s another London app success. I think London has been a great city. It’s one of the greatest talent pools in the world and to really drive world changing ideas London is a great place to start these days. All this started with a joke over a £20 note in a pub in Surrey. Wouldn’t it be funny, he said, if the Queen came to life. It seems there are no limits. Blippar is amazing and we are talking about brands but we are making kids realise that when you blip things the engagement level 65% higher. But there’s a line that you shouldn’t be pushing too much, that it should be voluntary? In general, people shouldn’t be pushed to do anything. It should be their choice. And with a £45 million investment secured to expand, there will soon be many more choices out there to blip. Well, we can talk now to Russ Shaw, who’s the founder of Tech London Advocates, a group which campaigns on behalf of London’s technology industry. Russ, we’ve seen one London app success story, but there have been quite a few? There have been many successful stories. You look at City Mapper is another example of great apps created and developed and exported around the world. London has this fantastic talent pool with such great creative people and now we have excellent software developers and programmers, all coming together and we are creating new sectors. I think we will see more of this happening. London is quite a challenging city to live and operate in. What are the challenges? Property prices are challenged, transport is a challenge. We have many people coming from the UK and around the world to live and set up and it is not always easy but once they get settled, people absolutely love it. The diversity and culture and the people coming here to create these businesses bringing such enthusiasm and passion. So what can we expect next? I think we will see some more exciting apps on the hit I is in and different types of businesses being created. When you look at retail tech, the convergence of advertising and fashion and design, we will be talking about advertising and fashion tech all on the horizon. Lots of tech but this is financially significant. Can you put a price on how much of this is worth to the London economy? I think over the next decade it will be worth billions of pounds and many companies are securing great evaluations and investment, and as these grow in size and scale, this will have an impact on the markets. Thank you. A proposal to demolish four buildings in one of London’s most historic streets has been stalled. Kings College wants to knock down the Victorian buildings on the Strand as part of a new campus development. The government has delayed the scheme after heritage campaigners opposed the plan. Ayshea Buksh has the story. You may easily walk past them without noticing, four empty properties sandwiched between Somerset House and Kings College London on the Strand. At the moment, they are locked up and used as storage by the University. Kings College want to redevelop them, much to the dismay of conservationists. Even after the Great Fire of London, these buildings were built to the same narrow frontages, so it had that wonderfuljostling character. Also it means that at street level a different shop or place to go in to, a different front door every few yards rather than these monolithic blocks. And this is what is planned, a new academic space with a grey brick and stone facade to match the only listed building in the terrace. Westminster Council gave planning permission but now the inspectorate has put the plans on hold. London is a mix of old and new, that is part of its magic, surely that is what will happen here? We disagree. We accept that it is a mix and is a fantastic city for architecture but these buildings are particularly significant in context. As I mentioned, this is one of the most historic streets in London and these buildings should be preserved. Kings College would not be interviewed but instead sent us a statement saying. .. So many places are new and modern, you can make anything, but these have history. You just know that the character would be changed desperately were they knocked down. It is quite ordinary and there’s still quite a lot of this around and how many people look up anyway? The planning Inspectorate will have to weigh up the needs of a modern academic institution if it wants to maximise its own space against the aspirations of conservationists who want to keep this part of London as it is. Still to come, dans takes over Tate modern performed by professionals and the public. -- dance. It’s time for the sports news and along with the rugby and football, one cricketer is holding onto the headlines. Sara Orchard is here with the details. Thank you, Alice, yes, once again Surrey batsman Kevin Pietersen is the hot topic of conversation after the new chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board, Colin Graves said the player was not given any firm promises about resuming his England career. Pietersen alleges that he was deceived about a possible return to international cricket in discussions last March. Graves has rejected the player’s claims and says he backs the decision by selectors not to pick Pietersen. Well, away from the KP drama, the Twenty-20 cricket season is underway this evening with Middlesex away at Gloucestershire and Surrey playing at the oval against Glamorgan. There’s ball-by-ball commentary of both games right now on the BBC London and BBC Sport websites. Meanwhile on our radio station tonight, BBC London 94.9FM will have full commentary of Brentford, who will be trying to beat Middlesbrough for the first time since 1964 to keep alive their chances of becoming a Premier League club next season. They’re 2-1 down after the first leg of their Championship play-off semi-final. If the Bees lose or draw away tonight it will be manager Mark Warburton’s last match in charge with his contract finishing at the end of the season. Saracens rugby club are fighting for a place in the Aviva Premiership semi-finals tomorrow as they take on already relegated London Welsh in the last round of matches of the regular-season. Sarries have reached the Premiership play-offs in the last five seasons but even if they win with a bonus point they could miss out on a place in the top four if other results don’t go their way. Now, the all-action style of handball made it a real hit with spectators at the London 2012 Olympics. Since then the sport has had a tough time, with UK Sport removing all funding from the British team last October. But this weekend there’s a chance to win new-fans as handball’s National Cup final day takes place on the Olympic Park. Chris Slegg reports. At London 2012, the Olympic handball venuein At London 2012, the Olympic handball venue in the nickname, the box that rocks. And the copper box should be rocking again tomorrow because it is handball’s equivalent of the FA Cup final day, and it could be a very special occasion for London’s best club. It is called London GD. The women’s team will complete the double if they beat Coventry in the final. I hope there will be a lot of people so I cannot wait to play the game. It isjust people so I cannot wait to play the game. It is just volunteering and passion so we’re not used to having people watching us. In the men’s cup final, London GD take on Warrington Wolves who pipped them to the league title two weeks ago. All the guys are excited about the opportunity to bring the cup back home. Three years ago we were playing in a very small court with no lines and now it is very exciting. The GD stands for great Dane, the original name. It was founded by a group of Danish women in 1976 and now as well as having a men’s team, it has players from all over Europe. I think it is amazing because when you come to a new city you do not know many people and by playing a team sport you make friends and go out and there’s a lot of social stuff. They’ve is only one British player at the club. London GD hope to change that and raise the profile of a sport suffering in the wake of Olympic funding cuts. This is fantastic, it is fast and varied as aggression and physical contact, and to promote it you have to have venues to practice in and that is what we are lacking. One venue that is not lacking is the copper box and success for London GD tomorrow could see handball went over some new fans in the capital. The atmosphere at 2012 was incredible, so if you’re going along, have a brilliant time. That’s all the sport, Alice. It’s no stranger to holding unusual exhibitions, and tonight’s no different, as the Tate Modern is transformed in to a nightclub. It’s all part of a 48 hour exhibition where dance ""takes over"" the museum. Musee de la danse includes performances from almost 100 professionals. The public are also invited to take part, as Tarah Welsh reports. Is it art, a performance orjust plain fun? It didn’t seem to matter because when Musee de la danse opened this morning it didn’t take long before everyone was moving. This is the man behind the exhibition, a trained dancer who wants this museum to be accessible to all, 448 hours at least. I would like to think of this as a museum but for dance, so how would that look? And tomorrow, this is Musee de la danse, a counselling museum, where the artwork and visitors are dancing and even the directors. -- dancing museum. It is brilliant to bring the kids and engage and see how it is done. It is very funny. We had a really lovely time and the guy is quite quirky. What did you think? Did you feel happy when he was dancing? This is all a bit of a warm up before the big event which will be a disco. The exhibition continues into tomorrow until the company go and perform at Sadlers Wells on Sunday and into next week. The biggest shows are taking place in the turbine Hall but there are almost 100 professionals dancing in the galleries. People can take part, watch, or simply ignored it. How hard is it to put on performances in an art gallery? Logistically it is another ball game because it is not simply and putting them on a plinth, it is working with performers and there’s a different approach and we are learning about that. Some are learning new moves, others may want a debate about what dance should look like, and many are simply having a good time. Now the Weather with Louise Lear. Could be warmer for this time of year. Cloud and rain spelling and from the south-west and today a different story with the cloud breaking up and we have had quite a bit of sunshine. Cloud coming and going and the temperature is still not brilliant, 15 Celsius is quite disappointing, but at least it was dry with some sunshine. Let’s look at the far north and west with cloud and rain gathering. Overnight, it is going to be a weakening our fear saw no more significant rain, which may not keep some of you happy, but outbreaks of patchy and there rain through the night. The cloud building up and the rain coming dawdling and to the south and east. Around 11 Celsius. We start of potentially on Saturday, a little bit grey and disappointing, but things improve, fingers crossed, improving by the middle of the morning. Stillthe improving by the middle of the morning. Still the breeze from a north easterly direction so that will feeljust a little fresher work highs of 17 Celsius, a little cooler in the Home Counties. Through Saturday night we will continue to see the cloud thickening, but it will not be too bad a night. The odd spot of rain in the breeze with the temperature down around nine Celsius. Sunday generally dry with a little more cloud than we have seen on Saturday and again the breeze will be noticeable. The temperature around 13 Celsius, maybe higher. Plenty of rain to come into the weekend. Monday looks as though it will be pretty wet. Thank you. The main headlines. The Prime Minister says he’ll consider giving more powers to Scotland, over and above those already agreed before the general election. Today, David Cameron had a meeting with the SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon. The London MP Chuka Umunna has pulled out of the contest to be the next Labour leader. He says the pressure on him and the level of scrutiny of those close to him has prompted him to reconsider. Tributes have been paid to Britain’s oldest poppy seller, found dead in the Avon Gorge in Bristol. According to relatives, 92-year-old Olive Cooke may have taken her own life after being exhausted by appeals from charities. The mayor wants to curb the number of minicabs in London as a way of easing congestion - but critics say the move would mean higher prices for passengers and fewerjobs for drivers. All rail routes in and out of the capital are expected to be disrupted by a strike on Bank Holiday Monday. Services could also be hit on the first day back to work after the long weekend. That’s it. We will be back later during the ten o’clock news, but for now from everyone on the team, have a lovely evening. Goodbye. DRAMATIC MUSIC BUILDS Right, One Show - final stop, everybody. Off! Hello and welcome to a fruity and VEQQY Hello and welcome to a fruity and veggy One Show with Chris Evans. And jones here. This bus has been with jamie Oliver. Here isjamie. He has been driving around all day. It is part of the Food Revolution. It is here tonight. jamie Oliver! How has it gone? We had a procession through town. We have done interviews with channels from countries around the world. We have been at a bunch of schools doing lovely things and hanging out with the fruit and veg. I will talk about the revolution later. Have you driven this bus yourself? Definitely not. I have been concentrating on all the activities going on. This is the thing, isn’t it? We are shots, inexperienced, but enthusiastic drivers, we are your team. You are doing the test! We are saying that not sound like a yes. We’ll work on him. What is going on with restaurants? What is going on with restaurants, jamie, serving food on anything but plates! That is true. We have the story served up. I know how competitive the restaurant game can be. With people in this country spending over £40 billion every year on eating out, we all want a slice of that pie. It means thinking up more inventive ways of getting bums on seats and enhancing that dining experience. From outrageous themes, deck core and dishes, now we even have started to mess with the humble plate! I am with Ross who runs a Twitter feed that names and shames restaurants which serve food in weird ways. It is where people can serve meals of food they get served in restaurants where they think it is served in a weird manner. How about miniature beef Wellingtons on barbed wire! The potato on a shoe. Chicken in a basket it is not hygienic. And that tin tray is like it is out of a prison. I think in five years the waiter will shuffle UP five years the waiter will shuffle up to the table with the food cupped in his hands and we will eating it out of them. While it is fun to poke of fun at these examples, William Sittwell takes what we eat on very seriously. He is calling for more traditional values. seriously. He is calling for more traditionalvalues. Hello. How are you? I am a little bit overwhelmed. Fire extinguishers, the only good thing is to turn this upside down and find the bin where it belongs. I think that gimmicks do divert chefs from doing what they should do well - which is serving it simply. It is all part of this social media obsession, where people sit in a straupt and the first thing they do is take -- straupt and the first thing they do is take -- in a restaurant and the first thing they do is take photographs. They are more keen on taking photographs than talking to their neighbours. The reason we come together over food their neighbours. The reason we come together overfood is together over food is so we can talk. How would you have us serve this food? Well, do you know what- do you remember one of these things? Round, white, simple. Look how much... Look how pretty that looks on a plate. It tasted so much nicer on a plate like this. Is he being a tad overdramatic? This restaurant thinks so. They told me their novelty plates are a big hit with customers. What do the public really think? Roll up, roll up forthe dustbin lid verses the plate challenge. Would you prefer your food on something like this or on a plain white plate? This looks like I have more to eat. It is more presentable. A plain, white plate. That is more appealing. I would not like my dinner on a dustbin lid. It looks like there is more on a plate. Why a plate? It is sensible and of classer. Has this been on a dustbin? No. I will be fine with this then. So the verdict is in. Who would have thought the dustbin lid would have won over the classic white plate. Here is one for you, jamie, who what do you think of this - Here is one for you, jamie, who what do you think of this - I call it the builder’s breakfast. Ona On a brick! Not for me. Not big enough! It could be a breeze block! They serve food on hot stands. When you can cook fish or meat on it. That is kind of cool. If it is a good conversation though, it is all burnt. That is a primitive way to cook. Who’s fault is it? Do we arrest you? Do we arrest Heston? I like a plate, platter or a board. When it gets to dustbin lids or... The shovel!

The Boston marathon bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, has been sentenced to death by a court in the US. Three people died and more than 260 were injured in the bombings two years ago. Tsarnaev, who’s 21, was convicted last month of all 30 oK, Tsarnaev, which carried the possibility of the death penalty. Our North America Editor, jon Sopel, is in Boston for us tonight. The finishing line of the Boston marathon two years ago and the scene of joy turns to marathon two years ago and the scene ofjoy turns to one of horror. Two pressure cooker bombs have gone off within 12 seconds of each other, around 200 yards apart, killing three people, injured 261+ others. The clerk went through the various counts and the mitigating factors, but then, the conclusion: A unanimous agreement- death is the appropriate sentence, eachjury appropriate sentence, each jury memberaffirming appropriate sentence, eachjury member affirming yes that is our verdict. Outside the federal court house there was this reaction. The trial of this case has show cased an important American ideal that even the worst of the worst deserve a fair trial and due process of law. Today the jury has spoken and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev will pay with his life for his crimes. This was a trial which really wasn’t about Tsarnaev’s guilt or innocence. At the outset his defence lawyer said it was him in all the security videos and that he had been part of the crimes. In the three days of mayhem that started with the bombings on the course of the marathon and then the shootout that led to the death of his older brother, culminating in Tsarnaev Tsarnaev’s -- Dzhokhar Tsarnaev Tsarnaev’s - - Dzhokhar Tsarnaev arrest, Tsarnaev’s -- Dzhokhar Tsarnaev arrest, the defence case was that he was a kid led astray by his older, radicalised brother. When the jury was take ton see the bullet-ridden boat, they were shown the jihadi manifesto that he wrote on the hull before his capture. And CCTV images from his prison cell hardly showed a man consumed by regret. However, this nun who went to see Tsarnaev sent he was full of remorse. The pleas of mitigation did not sway the jury. jonjoins me now. You were inside the court. What was the atmosphere like? Well, the courtroom was almost crackling with tension and anticipation. The only person, I have to say, who looked relaxed in that setting was himself, now sentenced to death for the crimes he committed two years ago. jurors were openly weeping as he looked ahead impassive, his hands classed in front of him -- he looked ahead impassive, his hands classed in front of him -- clasped in front of him, shifting his weight from one foot to another. The legal process has not yet reached its end, because by passing a death sentence on him, in that dramatic moment when eachjuror had to on him, in that dramatic moment when each juror had to say, yes, that is mY each juror had to say, yes, that is my verdict, there will now be appeals. If it was a life sentence without parole, that would have been the end of the matter. Now there will be an appeals process that could go on for many years and that means, for the victims and their families, well, this process has not reached its end. But the Attorney-General of the United States tonight has said that the court reached the appropriate verdict. After meeting the SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, in Edinburgh, David Cameron says he will consider proposals for devolving more powers to the Scottish Parliament. Before the election, he agreed to allow the Scottish Government to take control of income tax and some welfare spending. Ms Sturgeon now wants further powers over other areas. Mr Cameron says he will look at sensible suggestions. Our Scotland correspondent, james Cook, reports. The weather is one of the few things they do agree on. These two politicians do not see eye to eye. One Unionist, the other Nationalist. One Conservative, the other Social Democrat, pushed together by an election in which both could claim victory. Inside, David Cameron and Nicola Sturgeon talked forjust under an hour. It was, we’re told, constructive and business-like, if not actually friendly. So what was agreed? What was significant today and very welcome is that there is awillingness to look at the proposals we now make. So the ball is in the court of David Cameron. He can decide to ignore the voice of the Scottish people. People will draw their conclusions about Westminster’s ability to serve Scotland better. Or he can listen to what people in Scotland said last week and respond positively. In this very room last year, a package of new powers for Scotland was agreed. The question today is whether David Cameron is prepared to go further. He says he’ll have a look, but he doesn’t sound very keen. The choice now is what sort of future for Scotland in the United Kingdom. My vision is a strong Parliament, with tax-raising powers, with spending powers, one of the strongest devolved parliaments anywhere in the world, but I wouldn’t want to see Scottish taxpayers loaded with extra cuts or extra taxes because of another agenda. So where is all this heading? The powers already promised to the Scottish Parliament include control over the rates and bands of income tax, a slice of revenue from VAT and Air Passenger Duty. The powers now being demanded go further, they include: National insurance contributions, the ability to vary the minimum wage and to set a separate corporation tax rate in Scotland. There is now a thirst for more powers, among both supporters and some opponents of independence. In this family-run cafe, Mike vote no in last year’s referendum. His son-in-law, Scott, says yes. But like many voters here, both now want change. We voted in different ways in the referendum. That’s true. But we are both proud to be Scottish. That’s right, yeah. We can probably both agree that more powers at Holyrood is a good thing. Though maybe I’d like to see more than you. Yeah, more powers, maybe in complete control of the fiscal budget, raising their own taxes, VAT, airport duty, whatever, then spending their own money. They might see who has it then, once they have to spend their own money or our money. We have to respect there was a referendum and there was a decision on that. Having said that, I don’t think things should stay as they are. I think there’s a large majority of people in Scotland do want change. When it might come and where it might lead is far from clear, but two politicians with opposing aims are now involved in a difficult and delicate dance. Only three days after putting himself forward to be the next Labour leader, Chuka Umunna has withdrawn from the race. Mr Umunna was considered one of the favourites to replace Ed Miliband but says he has found the scrutiny he has come under in the last few days ""uncomfortable."" Here’s our Political Correspondent, Ben Wright. On Tuesday he was in. I will be standing for the leadership of the party. But today he’s out, a campaign launched on new media scrapped, he claims, after pressure from old media. Young, sharp, slick, Chuka Umunna was a strong contender for Labour’s top job. So his statement today stunned Westminster. In it he said, ""Since the night of our defeat last week, I have been subject to the added level of pressure that comes with being a leadership candidate. I have not found it to be a comfortable experience."" Friends of the Shadow Business Secretary say Mr Umunna’s girlfriend and family have come under intolerable scrutiny since he decided to stand, with reporters camped outside their homes. This, he thought, was not the future he wanted. I think it’s absolutely tragic. I think Chuka had the potential to be a great party leader, a great Prime Minister. He was the candidate the Conservatives feared the most. If it’s as a result of press intrusion into his extended family, I think, that’s a sad indictment of our political age. Chuka Umunna has been in the public eye for a number of years. He must have thought about the scrutiny the leadership contest would involve. His explanation doesn’t stack up, does it? I don’t think anyone not in public life can appreciate the level of intrusion that happens if you put yourself forward for a job like this. The former City lawyer has been the MP for Streatham in south London since 2010 and was seen as a modernising candidate. One seasoned newspaper man said he should have expected the scrutiny. It’s only when you’re under fire, as he has aparently been in the last few days, that you realise what mettle people are made of. It seems that he’s melted. So, has it been a loss? I think it might have been an early indication of good luck for Labour. It’s been a difficult, disorienting week at Labour headquarters, the scale of election defeat far greater than anyone expected. Many in the party will be dismayed Chuka Umunna has taken his hat out of the ring, leaving four candidates facing a four-month campaign and a fight for Labour’s future. There is no damaging story about to appear in the papers insist Chuka Umunna’s friends. He will still play a frontline role. But party leader? He thinks too soon, too much to lose. So for now, he’s walking away. Extremists from the self-styled Islamic State in Iraq have seized key buildings in the city of Ramadi, just 70 miles from Baghdad. Fighters captured the police headquarters and the governor’s office, after suicide bombers breached the city’s defences.

But the fighting is close to Earlier today the party leader, Nigel Farage, called on his critics to put up or shut up. Our political correspondent, Ben Geoghan, has more. What does Douglas Carswell have to say? Nigel Farage has had to fend off attacks from several people in his party this week. The article by Douglas Carswell makes clear he has some doubts about the direction the party is going in. He says Nigel Farage is inspirational, but he says the toe the party is adopting is too angry. He suggests it ought to be more optimistic and Ukip should do more to build a positive coalition against Britain’s membership of the EU. He refers back to the election campaign and those comments made by Mr Farage about HIV patients, who came to this country for treatment. He said using those patients as an example was ill-advised. He accepts Mr Farage has the backing of his party, of the National Executive Committee but he says every party leader needs a break sometimes and he says Nigel Farage should have a break now. The United Nations has accused countries in South East Asia of the ""appalling and inhumane"" treatment of thousands of migrants who are stranded at sea. It says at least 6,000 people’s lives are at risk. Most of them are ethnic Rohingya - Muslims who face persecution in Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, where the UN says they face institutionalised discrimination. Thousands have boarded smugglers’ boats, in hope of a better life. Now, many are stranded in desperate conditions - with countries including Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia turning them away. jonathan Head has been following the fate of one boat of migrants. Here’s his latest report. A fishing boat crammed with migrants off the coast of Thailand. These are Rohingya Muslims, fleeing persecution in Myanmar, where they are not even recognised as citizens. The Thai Navy dropped supplies, setting off a frantic scramble in the water. We found them yesterday, pleading for food and water. They had been abandoned by the people smugglers transporting them and been at sea for two and a half months. But would they be allowed to stay? One localjournalist allowed to observe the Thai military as they boarded the boat and repaired the engine. Her video records the appallingly cramped conditions on the boat. Women and children, in visible distress. Some of these people are clearly in need of medical treatment. Many appear to be half starved. Thai officials insist the passengers wanted to move on and not stay in Thailand, but it was apparent to the journalist, who filmed this, that many on board wanted to be set ashore. TRANSLATION: The women, children and some men came to me, crying, holding my hand. I felt strongly they need help, they did not want to go. They had no idea where they were going. I’m certain not everyone wanted to move on again. Thai Navy officers had to show untrained men how to operate the boat before it could leave. It seemed dangerously ill prepared for another long sea journey. At sunrise the boat was under way again, on Thai military orders, but it headed not to nearby Malaysia but towards Indonesia, a full day’s sailing. Whether they made it, we don’t know. Nor do we know if the Indonesians will accept them or send them back to sea again. As we’ve heard, the Rohingya are regarded as one of the world’s most persecuted minorities. They are denied citizenship in Myanmar, and thousands have been forced into camps by the authorities. jonah Fisher is in Sittwe, and has sent this special report. Driven to take extraordinary risks by the misery of life back home. Rohingya Muslims have lived here in western Myanmar for generations. But they’re not welcome. Denied citizenship and with their movements tightly restricted. It’s no wonder tens of thousands of them have rolled the dice and headed out to sea. It’s a story we hear again and again. Young men leaving in search of a new life and ending up as hostages. What we’ve been hearing here is that people take relatively small boats from the Burmese coast and then head out into deeper waters, where they meet up with a much larger ship and it’s that ship which takes them across the Andaman Sea, to Thailand, where they get very firmly in the grip of the human traffickers. It’s those traffickers who then make the call, often back to here, to the families, demanding a ransom. People are endlessly coming up to us with telephone numbers, these are telephone numbers of the traffickers? Of the traffickers who they’re in touch with. This man’s17-year-old son left here seven months ago and the negotiations started soon after. So the ransom was paid to the brother of the trafficker, who is in Malaysia. these are telephone numbers of the traffickers?

Musicians and fans around the world have been paying emotional tributes to the blues legend BB King - who’s died at the age of 89. He was born into poverty in Mississippi, and began performing in the 191+os. He went on to influence a generation of musicians and to work with Eric Clapton and U2. Our correspondent Nick Higham looks back at his life. BB King was the real deal - almost the last of the authentic Mississippi Delta bluesman. He was a sharecropper’s son, who first heard raw blues hollered in the cotton fields around his home. He started out singing gospel music, but not for long. I found that when the people asked me to sing a gospel song usually they would always praise me, but somebody would ask me to play and sing a blues would always give me a tip and sometimes a beer. Well, I don’t have to tell you where the motivation came from. He was a superb musician, but also an entertainer. This concert, filmed in a New York prison, shows his rapport with an audience. # I gave you seven children and now you want to give ‘em back #. To start with he played only to black audiences in segregated America, but by 1969 he was supporting the Rolling Stones on a US tour. They remained devotees. He’s a giant in the 20th century, like Ray Charles, like Louis Armstrong, like Duke Ellington and people like that. He stood out like that, in his own career, massively high and really loved. I’m getting a bit emotional. He played with a distinctive vibrato, the notes shimmering, often wilfully bent. # The thrill is gone #. He influenced an entire generation of rock guitarists. Eric Clapton, saying here alongside King, was anotheradmirer. This music is almost a thing of the past now and there are not many left that play it in the pure way that BB did. He was a beacon for all of us who love this kind of music and I thank him from the bottom of my heart. # Baby, don’t you want to go #. Three years ago he played the White House - the president sang along. # Sweet home Chicago #. Today, Mr Obama said America had lost a legend and predicted one killer blues session in heaven tonight. BB King brought down barriers, brought the blues to a wider audience and brought joy to generations. BB King, whose death in Las Vegas was announced this morning. He was 89. He’s one of Britain’s most colourful artists, so when Turner Prize winner Grayson Perry was asked to design a holiday home, it was never going to be boring.

There’s a warning tonight that the Mayor’s plan to curb the number of minicabs in London will mean higher prices for passengers and fewerjobs. Currently, around a thousand minicab licences are granted each month, but Borisjohnson says it’s making the roads too crowded. Unsurprisingly, his plan has been backed by drivers of black taxis. More from our political correspondent, Karl Mercer. They weren’t going very far or fast at Paddington this afternoon, but it appears that London’s cabbies may soon have something to smile about. The Mayor has said he wants to bring in new laws to limit the number of mini cab drivers in the capital and also tackle the unlicensed rickshaw trade. You ca n’t move. They’re just parked up on the side of the road in front of you. You can’t do nothing. At the moment, Transport for London have no powers to cap the number of mini cab licenses, and the number of drivers has gone up dramatically in the last year, spurred by phone apps like Uber. In 2009, there were just over 59,000 mini cabs in London. That rose to 65,500 in 2014 and this year has hit more than 76,000. Up 11,000 in the last year alone. The reality is there isn’t the amount of work there for this number of mini cab drivers. Many of them are convinced that there are certain apps promising them £1200 a week. The reality is many are only earning minimum wage. London is suffering as a consequence. Those in the black cabs might like the promise, those who are the target of it don’t. This afternoon Uber issued a statement saying that the cap on the number of private hire licenses was a limit on choice. They said it would mean higher prices, fewerjobs and would actually result in more congestion, as people resort to using their own cars. There are only 8,000 buses 25,000 cabs, but now we have 75,000 private hire vehicles. Within two years that will be over 100,000 vehicles. That will have a significant impact on congestion. Cabbies have their own description of Transport for London and it’s not exactly complimentary. They remain a pretty sceptical bunch about the latest plans. He’s been saying that for years, but it ain’t happened. He says a lot of things, the Mayor. A man who beat his four-year-old daughter to death has been jailed for life. Carl Wheatley had fought to get custody of Alexa-Marie Quinn ,as a way of claiming more benefits. But he subjected her to weeks of abuse, and she suffered more than 60 injuries - dying of internal injuries. More now on the rail strike set to start on Bank Holiday Monday. All rail routes in and out of the capital are expected to be disrupted by the industrial action. Services could also be hit on the first day back to work after the long weekend. What more do we know? If the strike goes ahead, it will be the first of its kind in more than 20 years. The strike is set to start at 5pm on the bank holiday Monday and last for 21+ hours. Now it’s going to cause maximum disruption because anybody trying to get back into London after their holiday is going to find it extremely difficult by using the trains. The main disruption will be on the Tuesday morning with commuters trying to get into the capital to get back to work. Members of the RMT union, from signallers, maintenance staff and station workers are walking out in the dispute over pay. Earlier I was in Guildford and spoke to commuters there. Really it’s a bit disgusting because they charge enough as it is for us to get on the trains and then causing more problems by going on strike. Its not the fault of the people on the ground. It’s the fault of those probably getting abuff inflation pay rises. I spoke to the RMT union today and they said to me that their workers do deserve better. What Network Rail is offering is not good enough. There are going to be talks on Monday. We will see what happens then. Thanks very much. A proposal to demolish four buildings in one of London’s most historic streets has been stalled. Kings College want to knock down the Victorian buildings on the Strand, as part of a new campus development. The Government has delayed the scheme, after heritage campaigners opposed the plan. Ayshea Buksh has the story. You may easily walk past them without noticing, four empty properties sandwiched between Somerset House and Kings College London on the Strand. At the moment, they’re locked up and used as storage by the university. Kings College want to redevelop them, much to the dismay of conservationists. Even after the Great Fire of London, these buildings, many of them, were built with these same narrow frontages. It had the wonderful character. This is what’s planned, a new academic space with a grey brick and stone facade to match the only listed building in the terrace. Westminster Council gave it planning permission. Now the Government’s planning inspectorate has put the plans on hold. These buildings are particularly significant in their context. This is one of the most historic streets in London. These buildings should be preserved for that reason. Kings College would not be interviewed but sent us a statement: ""We’re extremely proud of our heritage and sensitive to the architecturally significant environment in which we operate. A thriving centre of excellence and education and research on the Strand brings considerable value and public benefit to London."" So many places are new and modern. You can make anything. These have got history. You just know that the character would be changed desperately if they were to be knocked down. They look quite ordinary. There’s still quite a lot of this around. How many people look up any way? The planning inspectorate will have to weigh up the needs of a modern academic institution that wants to maximise its own space against the aspirations of conservationists, who want to keep this part of London as it is. Well, it’s good night from me. I leave you now with Chris with the weekend weather. Things got better for London compared with yesterday. We had morning sunshine, some afternoon cloud. A lift in temperatures to around 16 degrees in the centre of town, five degrees warmer than yesterday. I suppose cloud will come and go a bit into the weekend. The good news is there will be a lot of dry weather on offer. Overnight cloud thickens from the north-west. We will see drizzle working through. Overall the rain will be very small. Given the cloudy skies, it will be a mild night. Temperatures no lower than 11 degrees in the centre of town. Morning drizzle clears away quickly with the sunshine coming out during the morning. Forthe middle part of the day, there will be a bit more cloud bubble up for a time. The best of the sunshine developing later in the afternoon into the evening time. A fine end to the day with not a cloud in the sky. It will be warmeragain with not a cloud in the sky. It will be warmer again with temperatures up to 19 degrees or so. A similar day on Sunday, but by Monday, looks like morning rain. Hello, let’s see what the weather has in store this weekend for most of us across the country. You know what, it’s to the looking too bad at all. Most of us will have bright weather. Scotland and Northern Ireland slightly different story. It will be quite fresh. Let’s look at the here and now. Cloud streaming off the Atlantic. It’s going to be quite overcast tonight. Little bits and pieces of rain around across England and Wales. Already raining in a few places. Quite mild actually. Temperatures no lower than 10 or 11 degrees in. Scotland and Northern Ireland, a lot fresher here. Around about five Celsius. That’s cool air coming from the North Atlantic.

The mayor says London could keep some of the cash raised from stamp duty. And a first look at the UK’s largest heart hospital which has opened in the City. Good afternoon, and welcome to the BBC News at One. The Chancellor will announce plans to devolve many more powers away from Westminster- arguing that the ""old model"" of running everything from London is ""broken"" and has unbalanced the economy. In his first speech after the election, George Osborne will set out plans to give English cities powers over housing, transport, planning and policing. Speaking in Manchester- which will elect a mayor in two years and take on such powers - he will say it’s that city that should become a blueprint for other large cities as he proceeds with his plans for a ""Northern powerhouse"". Here’s our correspondent judith Moritz. The old saying was that it is the streets of London which are paved with gold. But here in Manchester, they have never wanted to play second fiddle. Now there is a promise that this city and others in the North will get a huge boost, given greater powers to take charge of their own affairs. We have seen in our great cities are great Renaissance in recent years, a great resurgence of confidence there, more jobs being created than ever before. It seems to me that success breeds success. There is an ambition and an appetite for people to drive forward that success. Manchester will be held up as a blueprint for the rest of the country, given responsibility for its own transport, housing, planning and policing. It will all be run from here by a Metro mayor, due to be elected in 2017. It is a scheme the Chancellor has been championing. A particular passion of mine is to build the northern powerhouse here in the North of England. Manchester has been thought of as a northern powerhouse before. This Convention Centre was once Manchester Central station, built in the wake of the Industrial Revolution, when the city was known as cottonopolis. Those backing the new plans hope they will renew a sense of civic pride in northern cities like this as well as economic success. The government want other places to follow magister’s lead. What about the concerns that other northern towns and cities will have that Manchester is the focus that this again? Someone has to lead and go first because you cannot go at the pace of the slowest. -- go first because you cannot go at the pace of the slowest. -- and go first. There has to be a clear timetable over the next ten years for the other areas across the country as well as this. In cities around the North of England, people have a range of views about what is best for their communities. have a range of views about what is best fortheir communities. I best for their communities. I think many would definitely go to places like Leeds, Manchester, as it has done before, -- like Leeds, Manchester, as it has done before, -- money would. This part of the country always seems to get left out of everything. There is definitely too much power in Westminster. It would be a good thing to distribute it to the cities. If you get control of your money and budget, which will happen, we will tend to look after the money a lot better. The services that require it will get a benefit from that as well. The plans will be outlined by the Chancellor this afternoon. He is expected to say that this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to deliver radical devolution. judith Moritz, BBC News, Manchester. Well, let’s speak to Kamal Ahmed, our business editor. What does the North-South divide actually mean? It is about trying to rebalance Britain. There has always been a slight worry that basically, Britain is driven by London and the south-east, this is the economic powerhouse and the rest of the country is being slightly left behind. Oddly, there is evidence thatis behind. Oddly, there is evidence that is not quite true. If you look at some recent growth figures, the North West of England, for example, ad growth of 3.1+% for the last economic figures, the highest in Britain. It compares to London, for example, which is 2.6% growth. There is evidence there is already a bit of rebalancing. Looking at productivity per head, there is still quite a gap. It shows what a mountain there is still to climb. If you look at what is called Gross Value added figures, the amount of products and services produced in each region, let’s look at London and the figure is over £1+0,000. The jobs are better paid and they are in sectors like banking, for example, which are more profitable. That compares, for example, with Wales, where the figures are under £17,000 per head. Thejobsjust where the figures are under £17,000 per head. The jobs just are not as valuable and the products and services Wales has had a tough economic times many years and they are not as valuable. It shows there is still a huge gap in terms of the economy. But there is some evidence that the rebalancing is place. Thank you forjoining us. Ukip leader Nigel Farage is facing demands from within his party to face a leadership contest. The move follows a highly personal attack from his election campaign director, who was quoted in a newspaper calling him"" snarling, thin-skinned and aggressive"". Patrick O’Flynn, Ukip MEP, said Mr Farage was turning the party into a personality cult. Our political correspondent, Robin Brant reports. just days before the general election, this was Patrick O’Flynn, loyally drumming up support for his party leader. But that unity at the top of Ukip is now in tatters. The man who was a prominent face of the election campaign, the man he was brought in to sharpen up Ukip’s message, as turned on his leader. Patrick O’Flynn told The Times that Nigel Farage has become snarling, in skin and aggressive. He adds, what happened since Thursday night and Friday morning has certainly laid us open to the charge that this looks like an absolutist monarchy, or a personal cult. There are A million people out there who voted Ukip last week. And yetjust people out there who voted Ukip last week. And yet just days after the general election, the party finds itself in the midst of a very nasty internal row. It is about two things, the way Nigel Farage changed his mind and decided to stay on as leader, and some of the people working around him at the top of the party. The man behind Nigel Farage here it is his chief of staff, one of the figures attacked as inexperienced and aggressive. Another prominent Ukip official has told me he is dragging Nigel down. The resignation last week was the key moment. I am standing down. Nigel Farage Wenda Nel changed his mind three days later. Despite losing the election comedy was persuaded to stay. Some critics think that has damaged the party. Even loyal party officials agree. I would not call it a civil war. There is a robust conversation going on. What we need to do is look at the formerly of people who voted for us and our 50,000 are being used to describe people on either Arriving at the London HO, he knows the election may be the only way to resolve it now. Is the national executive committee backed me, it is not my faults. Norman Smith is at Westminster. The old robust conversations. just how big is this risk? My sense is that Ukip is on the cusp of descending into complete chaos and civil war, in part because of disenchantment and disappointment at their failure to achieve a breakthrough in the election, when they gotjust one MP, in part because of anger at Mr Farage’s U-turn over standing down. In part because of real hostility towards some of those around Mr Farage, who are accused of turning him into the angry man of the election campaign, attacking immigrants over HIV, attacking BBC audiences. Those close to Mr Farage insist he is going nowhere. They say this is not about Nigel. This lunchtime, some of those who have been critical the way the party has been run, like Patrick O’Flynn, have rallied around, saying that Nigel Farage is his political hero. I have spoken to one senior Ukip figure who says it is inconceivable that Mr Farage can remain, just as it was inconceivable that Nick Clegg or Ed Miliband should remain. One of their big donors, Stuart Wheeler, has come out and said that Mr Farage should go. I suspect the real key is how much appetite Mr Farage actually has two remain as leader. Could the party prosper without him, given so much of its success has been built on his shoulders? Thank you for joining us. The number of people detained for terrorism related offences across England, Wales and Scotland has reached record levels, up a third on the previous year. Scotland Yard says the number of people said to be of significant concern, who have left the UK to go to Syria, has exceeded 700. Let’s speak to our home affairs correspondent, june Kelly at Scotland Yard. What else have they been saying? These figures are a record high, 338 people have been arrested in relation to counterterrorism offences and more than half of those relate to Syria. just a couple of other statistics, 11% of the arrests are winning, and 17% are under 20. Obviously, this is creating a massive challenge for officers at Scotland Yard also more than half the arrests have taken place in London. But also for counterterrorism units across country. What the Commissioner, Sir Birgen home -- country. What the Commissioner, Sir Birgen home -- Bernard Hogan-Howe said this morning was that this is taking place in a policing landscape which is experiencing enormous cuts. He said they would have to look at where money is spent in the future. He spoke about the fact that we now have a new government. What he did say was that he welcomed the fact that the new government is proposing to bring in this Communications data Bill, which has been dubbed by critics as a snooper 's charter. Sir Bernard said it had been delayed too long by the coalition and was a vital piece of legislation for police, in their fight against terrorists. Thank you forjoining us. The pharmaceutical industry is being asked to pay for a £1.2 billion innovation fund to revitalise research into antibiotics. The proposals have been set out in a report by a government-appointed review team. It says drug-resistant strains of bacteria are threatening to make existing antibiotics useless, and the potential consequences for modern medicine are too catastrophic to ignore. Our medical correspondent Fergus Walsh reports. They are medicine’s magic bullets but the rise of drug-resistant bacteria is threatening to make antibiotics useless. That would be catastrophic for patients like Cathy, whose immune system is suppressed following transplant surgery. For me, antibiotics are life-saving. I can’t afford to catch an infection which could cause me to reject the kidney. Many big pharmaceutical companies have pulled out of antibiotic research because profits are uncertain. That is because new drugs are kept in reserve for years, so that bacteria can’t become resistant to them. There has not been a new class of antibiotics introduced for nearly 30 years. But now there is a radical plan to restart the drug pipeline. This leading economist wants industry to pay for an innovation fund to promote research. In return, you would guarantee profits for firms who created vital new antibiotics. -- firms who created vital new antibiotics. -- Leigh Wood. It is critical that pharmaceutical industry players take bigger initiatives on this. They are the ones that know how to produce these things. We have to come up with incentives or rewards to change their mindset. We have added an antibiotic resistant breaker to this old antibiotic. This British microbiologist has teamed up with an Indian pharmaceutical company to produce a compound known as an antibiotic resistant breaker. It is designed to weaken bacteria enough so that obsolete antibiotics will work again. At the moment, you have 200 antibiotics. If we could rejuvenate a quarter of them for even ten or 20 years with antibiotic resistance breakers, that gives the world, as it were, usable antibiotic combinations for another ten, 20, 30, Ao years. But it for new medicines to go through clinical trials and many fail the way. So the urgent need for more antibiotics remains, to safeguard the Fergus Walsh, BBC News. Our top story this lunchtime. More devolution and the creation of a Northern Powerhouse - the Chancellor unveils plans to reinvigorate the North of England. And still to come: The danger tojohnny The danger to johnny Depp’s down under. He has until the weekend to get is two Yorkshire Terriers out of Australia or they face being put down. Coming up in the sport, Cricket Australia say they will conduct an enquiry into the death of batsman Phillip Hughes. He died in November after being struck on the head by a delivery. The African Union is meeting in emergency session this afternoon to discuss the deteriorating situation in Burundi. The President- who’s reported to be in Tanzania - has appealed for calm, saying a coup has been foiled. But the coup leaders insist they remain in charge. There’s sporadic fighting reported in the capital Bujumbura today - after heavy overnight fighting. The East African nation was affected by the overspill of the Rwandan genocide in 1994 - but also had its own civil war in which more than 300,000 people were killed. Since then after a peace deal brokered by Nelson Mandela it’s has had a decade of relative calm. But the latest protests were sparked by the President’s decision to seek a third term in office. It triggered both violence and international condemnation. Our world affairs correspondent Richard Galpin has the latest. 24 hours after the coup began, the almost empty streets of the capital Bujumbura echoed to the sound of gunfire. just a few people daring to venture out, as rival factions of the security forces fight for control. We didn’t sleep that night because of fear. People get scared. We still don’t know the real situation here. We know there is a fight, but we don’t know what’s going on. We are still waiting. Appealing for calm in a statement posted online this morning, President Pierre currencies said the coup had been foiled and those who had announced it on radio stations were being hunted by security forces so they could be brought to justice. It’s believed the president is still in neighbouring Tanzania, where he’s been attending a summit. While unable to return to his country say he has at least received the backing of other African leaders here. We don’t accept the coup. We condemn it in the strongest terms possible. We call upon a return to constitutional order and in that country. Back in Burundi, the president’s forces say they’ve regained control of much of the capital but those behind the coup deny this. The attempt to overthrow the government, which started yesterday, was a combination of weeks of protests against the president, all sparked by his announcement that after a decade in power he now wanted another term in office. And if the violence continues the fear is the country could descend into ethnic conflict between the Hutus and Tutsis, similar to the civil war which erupted in the 1990s, in which 300,000 people died. A group of disabled people is taking the government to the High Court over huge delays in benefits. Thousands of people have been waiting more than a year for their personal independence payments - a new benefit being rolled out across Britain. Our disability correspondent Nikki Fox reports. Today, the High Court is hearing evidence from a group of disabled people. They argue that the stress and financial turmoil of waiting so long for a decision on benefit is unlawful. The outcome of this case impact millions. Two years ago, Penny was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Despite having this degenerative, incurable disease, she had to wait seven months for a decision. I got an eviction notice. I had no money. I had 22p. I couldn’t afford to get on the bus to go to the next town, to the people that help you fill in the forms for disabled people. Since April 2013, the Department for Work and Pensions started to replace disability living allowance with a new benefit called personal independence payments, or Pip for short. All new claimants, like Penny, have to be assessed, and those in receipt of the old benefit have to be reassessed. The idea of Pip is to help cover the extra hidden costs having a disability can incur, such as paying for mobility equipment and even extra heating. The latest figures show that over 78,000 people are still waiting for an assessment or a decision on whether they are eligible for Pip. Of those, more than 3000 have been waiting over a year. People are struggling financially. They are anxious. They are depressed. They’re worried about what the future holds for them and struggling to get by, day by day. The Department for Work and Pensions says the claims are now being processed at five times the rate they were last year but today, the court heard that those bringing the case had waited more than nine months for a decision. The judge was told their experiences were not unusual. A ruling as to whether such long delays are unlawful is expected in the next few weeks. There are now four candidates in the running for the Labour leadership. The Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has laid out her ambitions - joining Andy Burnham, Chuka Umunna and Liz Kendall. Well our political correspondent Iain Watson is in Sheldon in Birmingham. Yvette Cooper came here to announce her leadership bid, an outstanding school in Birmingham. She wanted to emphasise that as a mother of three she was in touch with people’s concerns. This is a feat which Labour won at the general election. I asked her about criticism made of her by Alan Milburn. He said the last five years has been a ghastly experiment with Labour moving to the left, while voters have moved to the right on some issues. Yvette Cooper acknowledged Labour had lost ground to all parties, including Ukip. We’ve got to win back those votes and I think that that is about making sure people have the confidence that we can match their ambitions for the future in order to drown out the Tory and the Ukip voices of fear. In the end, the only way to do that is to be listening to people’s concerns about the country, notjust looking inward at the Labour Party and certainly not looking back to the old remedies of the past, be it of Tony Blair or Gordon Brown or any of the remedies of the past. We’ve got to be about the future. ~ I asked her was the time really for a new generation of leaders, perhaps Chuka Umunna, Liz Kendall, people not associated with Labour government between 1997-2010. She answered Labour needed somebody with credibility and toughness to take on the Conservatives. That is her personal pitch, her political pictures people need to be -- Labour needs to be in touch with people’s ambitions. The Liberal Democrat MP Tim Farron has announced he’s putting him self forward in the contest to be the party’s new leader. He was one of the eight Lib Dems who held on to their seats when the parliamentary party was crushed in the general election and Nick Clegg swiftly resigned. Mr Farron says he wants to be a ""unifying force"" and has denied he has plans to rename the Lib Dems the Liberal Party. Nato has been carrying out its largest ever anti-submarine warfare exercise in the North Sea. It’s seen as a response to increasing activity in the region by Russian submarines. There have been recent reports of Russian activity off the coast of Scotland as well as Sweden and Finland. The exercise, though, has also highlighted a gaping hole in Britain’s defences as our defence correspondent jonathan Beale reports. They gathered in the North Sea, off the coast of Norway. Those that were hunting - and the hunted. For this exercise Nato warships will be tracking this German U-boat. But this is also the ocean under which Russia’s been stepping up its own submarine patrols. What it does is it focuses our mind on what we’re doing out here. For the guys that are down in combat, it’s not theoretical that we might have to do submarine warfare, so we should pay attention to it. For now, as this submarine dives, it’s the hunt for U33, not Red October. But over the past few months there have been reports of Russian submarines operating off the coast of Scotland, Sweden and Finland, under this very ocean, and when they dive often the first clue they’re there is the brief sight of a periscope. Back on the American warship the crew use sonar and sensors to detect the unseen enemy, but it’s not always easy to identify what lies beneath the waves. It’s probably easier for them than for us. There have been instances where we’ve spotted something. Russian submarines, potentially? I’m not at liberty to talk about that but. .. In general we’re always on the lookout. Tracking these submarines when they submerge in these vast stretches of ocean underneath the water can be like looking for a needle in a haystack, and it’s a task all the more difficult for Britain because of gaps in its defences. Britain no longer has any long-range maritime patrol aircraft that can scan below the sea for hundreds of miles. And over the past year the UK’s had to call on allies, including the French, to help search for suspected Russian submarines near or in its own waters. The UK has key vulnerabilities in anti-submarine warfare right now, so the UK should be pretty worried about this. The UK is now a soft touch. Where it has a weakness Russia has a strength and Russia will learn to exploit that. While many Nato allies have been cutting their defence budgets, President Putin has been heavily investing in his. It’s claimed the newest Russian submarines are the quietest in the world and Britain is now having to rely on others to meet that threat. Research suggests patients with advanced prostate cancer live nearly two years longer if given a chemotherapy drug, Docetaxel, at first diagnosis. The finding comes from the largest ever prostate cancer trial undertaken involving 6500 men. Patients are normally only given the drug after hormone treatments stop working, but it’s hoped the discovery could change the way people are treated. Our correspondent, Michele Paduano reports. Prostate cancer is one of the most deadly cancers. Around 11,000 men in the UK die every year and more than 40,000 men are diagnosed with the disease. Seven years ago 76-year-old john was told that he had just 3-5 years to live. Being selected for the largest prostate cancer trial ever undertaken changed that. Thanks to a new way of treating the disease he is still enjoying life. It’s given me a brilliant quality of life. I’m supposed to be dead now, according to what I was told and here I am enjoying life and feeling very healthy. Normally when patients are diagnosed with cancer they are given hormone therapy. If it fails, they are given chemotherapy. In the trial, patients were given six courses of the chemotherapy drug Doxetaxel when first diagnosed. Men who received the drug lived almost a year longer but in cases where the cancer had already spread life expectancy increased by almost two years. We’re having a meeting next week with representatives from the patients in the trial, because the drug is already licensed there is no particular reason why we can’t implement it straightaway. The drugs are well known, relatively cheap. The full results will be reported in America next week. Researchers are hopeful this will pave the way for changes in treatment and the perception of prostate cancer. The actorjohnny Depp has been told he has until Saturday to remove his dogs from Australia - or they will be put down. He’s accused of breaking import laws by not declaring his Yorkshire terriers - called Boo and Pistol- to customs when they flew into Queensland by private jet last month. Australia has strict quarantine laws to prevent the accidental import of animal disease and infections. Our correspondent David Sillito has more. This is the house on Australia’s Gold Coast currently being rented by Hollywood starjohnny Depp, and here inside two illegal aliens. Flaine -- Pistol and Boo, johnny Depp’s Yorkshire terriers, and if they stay this may be their final foreign holiday. He’s decided to bring into our nation two dogs without getting proper certification and permits required. It looks like he has snuck them in. We saw him taking them to a poodle groomer. Mr Depp as to either take his dogs back to California, or we’re going to have to euthanise them. The star is accused of having snuck the terriers into the country and bypassing the strict quarantine rules when he returned to Australia to continue filming the latest Pirates of the Cup parrot-- Caribbean film. Their cover was blown because of a haircut. They posed for this photo, then posted online. The threat of a terminal trip to the vet, the war on terrier as it has been called, has brought a reaction around the world, but it appears a resolution is emerging. The latest from Australia’s agriculture minister is that Mr Depp is preparing to send Pistol and Boo back home to safety. You’re watching the BBC News at One. Our top story today: More devolution and the creation of a Northern Powerhouse - the Chancellor unveils plans to reinvigorate the North of England. In a moment, we’ll have the weather - plus the news where you are. But first with the sport here’s Hugh Woozencroft. After another difficult week for English Cricket, new chief executive Tom Harrison says the game faces a challenge to generate interest. Without Kevin Pietersen, England acknowledge they need players to attract attention. joe Wilson reports. Bethnal Green Academy in East London is an outstanding school. It is also a school you may have heard of. Girls who came here were radicalised elsewhere and flew to Syria in February with huge media attention. But this is territory for cricket. Who are six presses British and Muslim identity like Moeen Ali? He found his direction with this sport. I know as a young kid, we needed cricket to take us off the streets in the areas I was brought up in an stuff. Cricket is such an influence on people’s lives. That is the hope. This school is where chance to shine was launched ten years ago. The charity started because cricket in state schools had almost stopped. It has reached 2.5 million children and English cricket hasjust lost its box office attraction, yes, Kevin Pietersen. That is a great pity. Kevin Pietersen. That is a great pity, Kevin Pietersen not playing for England and the drama that seems to be ongoing does nobody any favours. It is sad for Pietersen and it is sad for Pietersen and a desire for Andrew Strauss as it was the Paul Downton, sad for the game and that these kids operating and loving it behind me who don’t get to see play. One of the great challenges for dish cricket is awareness. If you want to see Moeen Ali play live for England on TV, it is only on a construction channel. It has been way for nearly a decade. -- subscription channel. English cricket’s new chief executive knows he needs to attract all sorts of media. It is new ideas and fresh ways of connecting with people. Those are the things we need to take time to do because at the moment, we don’t have the ability to talk to a broader orients -- broad audience with live content you to existing TV. Fondest cricket’s future, the crucial word is not Pietersen but participation. -- for English cricket’s future. Staying with cricket, former England captain Nasser Hussain believes the national team isn’t good enough to reject Kevin Pietersen. He hit a career-best innings this week of 355 not out for Surrey, but was told on Monday that he won’t be considered for selection this summer. Personally, I would have said to Kevin, as may be Colin Graves did, ""go away, play for a county, get some runs and we will consider you for is a election"". When he did that, I would have gone to him and said, ""you asked. At the moment, looking at the side, there handled the situation because we’re not good enough to be leaving at anyone. -- leaving out. After 17 years playing for his boyhood club, Steven Gerrard will make his final appearance at Anfield for Liverpool against Crystal Palace on Saturday. Gerrard will move to LA Galaxy at the end of the season without ever winning the Premier League. He told the BBC’s Football Focus programme it’s a regret. It is not the only regret. I think it is the biggest. I would love to be sitting here now, saying that I’ve got the full collection. It would have been the icing on the cake. But I also look at other FA Cup finals that I have missed out on, the second Champions League final, in 2007, that is another big regret. When you play football in the Premier League for that amount of time, you’re going to get highs and lows. You will always have incredible moments. You will have some cruel lows as well. It is part and parcel of being a footballer at the top. No one’s journey ever goes smoothly. Mine certainly hasn’t. But I’m certainly proud of it and I would not change it for anything. just a quick tennis line for you. Andy Murray has announced in the last hour he is pulling out of the Rome Masters due to ""fatigue"". Back to you. He says his wife has lost count of the number of spoilt meals which have ended up in the bin. But now, after nearly 50 years as a firefighter, Roger Smith will be spending more time at home - as he retires from the service - having become the UK’s longest-serving living firefighter. Phil Mackie has been to meet him. Roger Smith, 70 years young. The former town mayor and businessmen began his other career as a retained firefighter barely half a century ago. It is a far cry from how things were in 1967. Radio1 ago. It is a far cry from how things were in 1967. Radio 1 launched in the summer of love and Concorde was unveiled and Mohamed Ollie was stripped of his heavyweight title. Is that the oldest? In this quiet Shropshire town, Roger wasjust starting out and has stuck at it ever since. I wanted to do a service for the general public. Every time I came in, I knewl for the general public. Every time I came in, I knew I was helping somebody because somebody, somewhere was in need of our assistance what are your favourite memories of being a firefighter? I have rescued several people from burning properties. I have brought them out safely. Obviously, that is in itself an achievement, to be able to do that. In his long career, he has dealt with many serious incidents, major fires like these, and even an IRA attack. Is two sons are also firefighters and today, a former colleague also came to celebrate Roger’s achievements, despite his objections. I am Roger’s achievements, despite his objections. Iam -- Iam not one for, shall we say, fuss and bother, for want of a better word. But as someone said to me, after 48 years, we think you deserve it. There is still time for another drill but on Monday, Rogerwill wear still time for another drill but on Monday, Rogerwillwearthe still time for another drill but on Monday, Roger will wear the uniform for a final time. Phil Mackie, Monday, Roger will wear the uniform fora finaltime. Phil Mackie, BBC News, Shropshire. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Louise Lear. Very frustrating weather at the moment, no two days the same. Let’s cast our minds back to yesterday, hardly a cloud in the sky, someone, spring sunshine on offer. Temperatures across parts of England and Wales in the high teens and one or two places as high as 20 degrees, 68 Fahrenheit. Today, clouds filling in from the south-west, bringing rain, some of it heavy and it feels miserable in one or two spots, with temperatures are struggling to get into double figures. The cloud, wind and rain will be around for the rest of the afternoon, slowly easing the way through Cornwall and West Wales. But along the M4 corridor, some of the regular ten heavy emphasis on with surface water and spray. Rain as far north as the Midlands. If it is not too persistent across the south-east, we are expecting it to PEP UP south-east, we are expecting it to pep up into the afternoon. For the North of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, the further west you go, you will cling onto some sunshine, not a bad afternoon and temperatures will respond with highs of 13 or 14 and a bit more cloud of loss -- along North Sea facing coasts but predominantly dry. This evening and overnight, rain across England and Wales slowly slipping south and east. It will weaken into a band of light, drizzly rain. Further north, clearer skies and temperatures falling away quite sharply. Generally, we are looking at overnight lows of around 4-9 but gardeners and growers, take note, in Ross Botts, the cabbages could be down to freezing. That is low enough in places brought such of grass frost first thing through Scotland, Northern Ireland and parts of northern England. But all change again through tomorrow. Many areas starting off dry with sunshine and some fair weather cloud across North Sea facing coasts and down towards the south but it should continue to break up with central and eastern areas seeing the best of the sunshine. Cloud and rain gathering in the north and west, a contrast for you after today’s brightness. 12-14 in the rain and highs of 18 where we keep the sunshine in the south. As we move towards the weekend, that rain has to clearer way through Friday night into Saturday morning. A ridge of high pressure will build but still the isobars are squeezing together and the westerly wind will be a feature as we move into the weekend. It will be breezy but I suspect Saturday will be the best of the weekend days with some sunshine and a bit warmer, with highs of 17. We keep the westerly wind, driving in more cloud and a week where the front potentially bringing some rain into Northern Ireland on Sunday. That is how it is looking. Enjoy Now on BBC One, it’s time for the news where you are. Have a good afternoon. Welcome to BBC London news. I’m Katharine Carpenter. Borisjohnson has told BBC London the capital could get extra powers to spend stamp duty on large construction projects like Crossrail 2. The mayor says he’s met George Osborne this week to discuss And although the Treasury has some reservations, is confident a deal can be reached. What the Treasury would like to do, rather than giving us all of the stamp duty, which would be a huge transfer, they would like to do it project by project, idea by idea. So thatis project by project, idea by idea. So that is possibly realistic? That is the way forward. Surrey County Council has ordered a review of its adult social services after the closure of a care home in Banstead. Merock Park was shot by the Care Quality Commission last December because of concerns residents were admitted. -- at risk. An oil leak in north-west London has killed dozens of fish and birds in one of the capital’s largest canals. Residents say the slick began forming in the Grand Union Canal near Kensal Rise at the weekend. Birds have been taken to the Swan sanctuary for cleaning and The Canal and River Trust is trying to contain the oil. The UK’s largest heart hospital has opened in the capital. The purpose-built Bart’s Heart Centre aims to treat up to 80,000 ~ -- has brought specialist doctors and facilities together under one roof of the first time and expects to treat up to 80,000 patients per year. Caroline Davies has been to see it in action. This is what open heart surgery looks and sounds like in 2015. This isjust one of the operating theatres at Bart’s new Heart Centre, which hopes to help save more than a 1000 lives a year. The hospital will see more than 200 patients every day. People like 83-year-old Barbara Boswell. She’sjust had bypass surgery here, and is what you might call a fan. Marvellous, really. I’m surrounded by experts. It is quite an invasive surgery, apparently. But you could not have better. And the facilities are pretty sumptuous! Far more than I affected. The new centre has brought together the former London Heart and Chest hospitals. It will have more than 300 beds available to patients across north and east London and parts of Essex. ~ I was Iwas in and I had two stents put in. The staff there are marvellous. They have been put here now. But the hospital had seen its day. It was a marvellous old building but it was not fit for this day and age. It was time it went. The move comes as the hospital trust that runs Bart’s is facing deep financial problems. It had a deficit of more than £90 million last year and has also been put in special measures by the Care Quality Commission. They insist though, the new centre is the right way forward. What a centre of this scale does is allow us not only to have, for example, a cardiac surgeon on call, but several different types of cardiac surgeon, each doing specialist treatments, available round-the-clock. It is no longer good enough for the patientsjust have general services available round the clock. We need specialist surgical and cardiological services around the clock as well. The challenge for Bart’s will be providing those services at a time when it also has to balance its books. Caroline Davies, BBC London news. Now the weather with Elizabeth Rizzini. Good afternoon. What a difference a day makes. Yesterday, we were basking in warm sunshine and looking at highs of 20 degrees. Today it is very different indeed. There will be yet more rain spreading in from the West through the rest of the afternoon, some of it quite heavy at times. Many areas could see up to an inch of rainfall today and tonight. That will be more rain than we have seen over the last six weeks combined. We have got quite a cool easterly breeze as well. Highs of 11 or 12 Celsius. Overall, the picture is rather grim for the rest of the day. Look out for poor travelling conditions through the rush hour. The rain eventually fizzles out and it will be mostly dry by the time we get to the early hours of tomorrow morning. We will see some clear spells with temperatures towards northern and eastern areas forming the lowest, down to around six or 7 degrees. Fortomorrow, the the lowest, down to around six or 7 degrees. For tomorrow, the weather will pick up again, and it will be a nice day. A ridge of high pressure will begin so it will be dry and the wind will be nice and light with lots of sunny spells, so it will feel nice and pleasant in the sunshine with top temperatures up to 17 or 18 degrees, 64 Fahrenheit. That is around the average for the time of year. A pretty nice day tomorrow. Lots of dry weather on offer over the weekend. Perhaps some rain early-onset today morning but it will clear away and we will be left with some good spells of sunshine -- on Saturday morning. A bit breezy two with north-westerly ",,

And could the capital get to keep more of the stamp duty it generates to fund major projects? while in police custody in Fife. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. A rift has opened up at the heart of UKIP tonight. The party’s campaign chief, the MEP Patrick 0’Flynn, has launched a scathing attack on the leader Nigel Farage - calling him ‘snarling, thin-skinned’ and aggressive. And others within the party have urged Mr Farage to stand down - but his supporters insist he must remain leader. Our Political Correspondent Alex Forsyth reports. He’s at the helm of a party in turmoil, wrestling over which direction it should take. Is Ukip falling apart? Nigel Farage is once again facing questions over Ukip and his own future. If they unanimously backed me, that is not my fault, is it? As a week ago in a last push for votes Mr Farage was side-by-side with senior colleagues. ~ I will pass on your support to Nigel. Now this man, a key ally, although still loyal to Nigel Farage and his leadership claims he is surrounded by poisonous advisers who have made him snarling and somewhat hostile. Making complaints and to be showing an aggressive demeanour to the public, I don’t think it is Nigel’s natural way. I’d much prefer him as an ebullient, cheerful and optimistic politician. And I think that is the way he reaches out best. Ukip’s problems surfaced after the election. Nigel Farage failed to get a seat and even after A million votes they got just one MP. He quit as the Ukip leader but three days later was back in the job, which some thought was a mistake. Then there was around with the party’s only MP over public funding. This former Ukip donor thing is that the party needs more stability ahead of the upcoming debate over Britain’s role in Europe, so Nigel Farage should step down. He is very much Ukip but we need somebody new now. What he has done for the party is incredible, but I think in order to win the referendum we need a quieter approach. This split is about the party’s direction, whether it should continue with what some see as divisive rhetoric or take a calmer approach. For supporters in the strongholds it is his front man who is the focus. It has been going on throughout the election. Somebody has been having a go at Nigel. He was known locally as Nasty Nigel. I think he should stay and he should not have offered to resign in the first place. Nigel Farage today brushed off the criticism he has faced. I do not feel terribly aggressive, I have to say. This ugly public spat is undoubtedly damaging for him and his party. Tonight one of the advisers, thought to be the subject of the criticism, has tendered his resignation. Another one says that his contract is up at the end of the month. It might have been an argument about how the party is perceived, but when their leader is as well-known as Nigel Farage, someone who is credited largely with their success, there are undoubtedly questions about the future of its leader as well as the party. Thank you for joining us. The Chancellor George Osborne has been giving details of what he’s described as a radical devolution of power to cities in England. He’s offered power for Greater Manchester over housing, health and policing - and wants that to be a model for other cities. Our political correspondent Vicki Young sent this report from Manchester. Aim high, that is the message from the Chancellor to towns and cities in northern England. Manchester is preparing to lead the way with a new mayor and greater control over how money is spent across the region. George Osborne came to a Salford warehouse to tell a business audience that this was the way to revive former industrial heartlands. We know that the old model of trying to run everything from the centre of London is broken. It has led to an unbalanced economy, it has made people feel remote from the decisions that affect their lives, it is not good for our prosperity or democracy. In greater Manchester ten councils will come together under an elected mayor, control over transport means that a new ticketing system could be introduced across all buses, trams and trains and the region would control its own housing. Instead of developers having to apply to central government. And then there would have the responsibility of police commissioners. The head of this local IT firm says that one elected figure in charge would make a big difference to his business. Access ability is great, if we can short-circuit some of the decision-making. Priorities is a big thing, getting decisions made in a faster way and getting priorities lined up to assist businesses in the north-west. We all impact the economy but we want to be able to do it better. His first speech since the general election win is all about Manchester and it’s a very deliberate decision, not only is he making an economic point but cities like this should be making decisions about their futures, there is also politics with Scotland getting more powers, he is saying to English cities, you can have more of a say too. Forthat cities, you can have more of a say too. For that to happen Mr Osborne says that there must be an elected mayor, and just three years ago several places including Birmingham and Leeds voted against the idea, so did Newcastle. The City ‘s council leader today urged the Chancellor to think again. If he insists on this he will hold bank the things that he wants to achieve, letting us get on with the job of growing the economy and creating the jobs that we need. While Manchester is on the fast-track towards devolution, it is unclear how many will follow. Our Home Editor Mark Easton is in Manchester. That’s it, isn’t it? What is your sense of what other cities will make of this? I think there will be local council leaders across England who will be very interested in exactly what the Chancellor had to say today and what it means for them. I did a report showing 30 super councils where local authorities have banded together, using legislation to bid for new powers from George Osborne, very much the kinds of powers by greater Manchester was promised. For some greater Manchester was promised. For some of them they will say, hold on, we have formed ourselves into these super councils in the hope of getting power but we did not want an elected mayor. Now the Chancellor is saying, you have to have one and it requires a rethink. There is another issue about rural areas, quite a few of them have banded together hoping to form a super council, but these are very much centred around a metropolitan mayor. The Chancellor mentioned many devolution deals but for quite a few local authority leaders, they will be scratching their heads as to what all of this means for them. Thank you. Drug companies are being urged to set up a billion pound innovation fund to develop new antibiotics, to tackle the growing problem of so-called superbugs. A review commissioned by the government warns that drug resistant strains of bacteria are threatening to make existing antibiotics useless. Our Medical Correspondent Fergus Walsh has been to India and the United States to examine the problem. In the global war on superbugs, this hospital in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, marks the front-line. This is our intensive care unit. 60,000 newborns a year in India die from drug-resistant infections, as one antibiotic after another has failed. I would feel they will all die without antibiotics. Yes. It does scare us. It makes us feel frustrated because previously where drugs used to work, now they’ve stopped working. With a population of 1.25 billion, it’s here in India that more antibiotics are now used than anywhere else, but a combination of poor sanitation and widespread misuse of those drugs make it a perfect setting for the rise of superbugs. It’s notjust India, the world has overused antibiotics for decades and now the antibiotic pipeline is running dry, partly because many companies have pulled out of this area, as profits are uncertain. An independent review proposes an innovation fund to boost research and profit guarantees for those delivering vital new antibiotics. It’s critical that pharmaceutical industry players take bigger initiatives on this. They’re the ones that know how to produce these things. So we have to come up with incentives or rewards to change their mind-set. In the United States, researchers in Boston have made what some believe is a game changing discovery from a surprising source. They’ve identified 25 potential new antibiotics from soil microbes, including one called teixobactin which has proved highly effective in animal trials. Teixobactin is going to be potentially very useful to treat staph aureus MRSA infections, that’s one of the superbugs. Do you think there could be thousands more antibiotics out there, in the soil, waiting to be discovered? There’s no doubt in my mind that that is the case. Caution is needed. Human trials have yet to start and many promising drugs fail at that stage. But it could at least be part of the solution, helping to ensure the next generation of antibiotics will be there when needed. Fergus Walsh, BBC News. And you can see more about this in Panorama - Antibiotic Apocalypse. That’s on Monday evening on BBC One at 8.30. The Royal Navy flagship the HMS Bulwark has arrived in Sicily, after rescuing around 600 migrants in the Meditterranean Sea. The people were picked up trying to sail from Libya to Europe aboard inflatable dinghies. Our correspondent james Reynolds is in Catania, where HMS Bulwark docked this afternoon Explain what is happening. 617 migrants have been picked up by HMS Bulwark next to me, and the ship has been giving over passengers to the Italian authorities. Many of these migrants from Nigeria and Eritrea and are waiting to be given somewhere to stay. I spoke to one man who is 28 and from Nigeria saying that he was so glad to be rescued and I also met a 23-year-old woman who was pregnant and wanted her child to be born in freedom as she describes it. Britain is prepared to rescue these people but it does not want to settle them in the UK, there are worries that it will encourage more people to make the trip. Italy is looking after them and many of these people may decide to head out to the rest of Europe. Its history is littered with conflict in which hundreds of thousands of people have died. So there’s serious concern tonight about events unfolding in the central African state of Burundi. There’s been fighting on the streets for a second day, between people who say they want fair elections and supporters of the president, who doesn’t want to step down. Our Africa correspondent Andrew Harding reports. Civilians Civilia ns run for cover on Civilians run for cover on the streets today as the fate of one of Africa’s smallest and poorest nations hangs in apparent limbo. Rival elements in the security forces have been fighting for control of strategic buildings, particularly state television and radio. Troops loyal to the president insist that they hold the upper hand and his aides have dismissed the attempted coup as a joke. There is still confusion. Civilians are hiding in their homes. There are guns everywhere, we do not know what is happening. And I passed by their the other day and I found someone who was killed by a weapon, I found him in the road and I took him to hospital. Ido him in the road and I took him to hospital. I do not know who shot him. We are very afraid because we do not know what is going to happen. The radio is closed we cannot get any news. People are angry that the president was seeking a controversial third term in office. The leader is a former army chief and he says that he acted to prevent the president clinging to power illegally. For now the power struggle is more about politics than ethnicity but as in neighbouring Rwanda Burundi has a history of tension between Hutus and Tutsis. Swift action is needed to prevent civil war.

How should mental health patients - sometimes suicidal- be dealt with in emergency situations? In many parts of the country they’re arrested for their own safety, and put into a police cell. But now some senior police officers are calling for change. They say it’s wrong to criminalise patients, and that new schemes running in some forces in England are the way forward - where mental health specialists, often nurses, are deployed. Our correspondent Ed Thomas, has been given access to one team in Cheshire and sent this special report. How to cope with those who desperately need help. Suicidal and self-harm. Tonight, we see the pressure facing police in the struggle to protect lives in crisis. Her intention is to make her way towards the bridge and jump off. We spent three days with Cheshire Police. Here, an officer and mental health nurse work together and they’re getting more and more calls like this. She’s threatening to throw herself off the bridge. She’s already harmed herself. For nurse jane Unsworth and PCjenkins, it’s their first emergency of the night. A missing woman, she’s suicidal and has self-harmed. What have you done that with? So they need stitching up, don’t they? The officers are with her now, but what’s important is that a mental health nurse is now with her. In the past, Cheshire Police would have dealt with this alone. To protect, officers, without any other option, would arrest and section under the Mental Health Act. That could mean a vulnerable person being held in a cell. But not tonight. Instead of custody, the woman here is helped byjane and then taken to hospital to have her cuts treated. I felt like there wasn’t any hope in the world. An hour later, she’s calm and has agreed to talk. She asked us not to show her face. It’s absolutely terrifying being handcuffed and leg strained and all that sort of thing. Is it really worse when you’re sectioned? Yes, I’m definitely, definitely worse when I’m sectioned. What did this mean to you tonight, to speak with a mental health nurse? That was incredible because nice as the police often are, it’s quite intimidating with the uniform and with all that. We ended up going from me wanting tojump off a bridge, to having a joke, and I never thought that would happen. In the care of a nurse, she’s taken home. For tonight, she’s safe. A new day and a new crisis. She’s trying to set fire to the house while the officer is there. She’s got a long history of self- harming behaviours. This is high-risk. A young girl, known to mental health teams, and a mother desperate for support. The self-harming has become more extreme. Her emotions are more extreme. Both agreed to talk to us. I feel like self-harming all the time and Ijust want to die. Ijust don’t want to be here any more. To hear your daughter say that, what does that do to you? It kills me inside. Ijust want to take her pain away and put it inside me. So who do you turn to for help? The police. They’re the first people I ring each time, every time. Frustrating, been here many times. What she needs is full-time residential care. That’s what we’re waiting for. Until we get that, we’re just going to have this situation every few days. Where the police are called again and again. Every few days. jane, we’ve got to go. So, who should take responsibility for those with mental illness who ring 999? The demand is huge. I don’t think the police in isolation can do it and I don’t think mental health services in isolation at the moment can do it. We need to work together to deal with what’s happening currently. Into the night, more calls for help. Our emergency services keeping safe the most vulnerable of lives. Ed Thomas, BBC News, Warrington.

Police say terror arrests in England, Wales, and Scotland have reached their highest level since the September the eleventh attacks in 2001. The country’s most senior counter-terrorism officer warned that extremist groups such as Islamic State were trying to encourage people to carry out violent attacks here. With me now is is our home affairs correspondent june Kelly. It sounds like a worrying picture, june? That’s right. 330 terror arrests, and nearly half related to Syria. What is worrying is the number of teenagers being arrested. Laugh of those have been charged. It has been said that Islamic State, and other terrorist groups were trying to direct attacks in the UK. They are encouraging Britons to go out to Syria to train. More than 700 have done that, many have come back. They are using propaganda to encourage people history to carry out attacks and he says that the threat is coming from what the police call lone actors to sophisticated networks with ambitious plots. A brief look at some of the day’s other other news stories. The RAF has confirmed that two Typhoon fighterjets were scrambled, after a Russian aircraft appeared close to UK airspace. The Russian plane was escorted from what the RAF termed Britain’s ""area of interest."" The Liberal Democrat MP, Tim Farron, has announced he’s entering the contest to be the party’s new leader following the resignation of Nick Clegg. Mr Farron says he wants to be a ""unifying force"" in the party. And Mary Cray is to join the race to be the Labour leader. The fifth candidate to declare she is entering the race. The UK should hold an EU referendum ‘as soon as necessary’. That’s the message from the Governor of the Bank of England. Mark Carney warned today that businesses could delay making investments, as long as there is uncertainty about Britain’s future in the European Union. Our Business Editor Kamal Ahmed has more. Pressure out of the election, and a fresh uncertainty for the likes of this man who runs a software firm in Teesside. She says concerns about the timing of the referendum will worry her customers. WOI’I’y her customers. If worry her customers. If they are not sure this with what is going to happen with business with a UK country if we are no longer part of Europe, we could lose out on hundreds of thousands of pounds of business. Today, Mark Carney put a careful toe into the water on whether it would be better for business to hold a referendum early. Questioned been john Humphreys on the Today Programme, he said that the referendum was a priority. It is in the interests of everybody that there is clarity about the process and the question and the decision... And the speed? Sooner rather than later? With all deliberate speed. Indeed but can I take it that means sooner rather than later? Government made it clear it is a priority, I’m sure that they will act with appropriate speed. The governor will want to avoid the deep waters of this subject. Officials here at the Bank of England have said that the governor’s remarks should not be overinterpreted. Mark Carney will want to avoid a political row over the timing of a delicate issue. Other business leaders urged caution. It is going to take time to get a better deal. We have to work with all of our European partners in a way that could not be done before the general election. We are only just at the beginning of that journey. You have to go back a long way, Ao years, for the last time Britain voted on being a member of what was then the European economic community. After so many years, the government may not want to rush to a new vote this time. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard is playing his final match for Liverpool Football Club at Anfield on Saturday, against Crystal Palace. He is to join the American Major League Soccer side LA Galaxy in june. Andy Swiss looks back at his time with Liverpool. It seemed one of sports unbreakable bonds, from schoolboy to skipper, Liverpool for life. Steven Gerrard! He’s got it. But after all of the goals and the glory it is goodbye. As Steven Gerrard prepares for his Anfield swansong he told me it will be tough. Stephen, you are known as a strong character but how emotional will Saturday be for you? I’ve been dreading this moment in a strange way. I’m going to miss it so much. Playing at Anfield, playing in front of the fan, I’m going to miss playing with my team-mates. It is going to be emotional but the plan is to stay strong, keep it together and try to avoid the tears. It has been some journey, from his debut as a fresh-faced 18-year-old, to a footballing figurehead, who inspired Liverpool to the Champions League. Few players have defined a club quite like Steven Gerrard. He made more than 700 appearances for Liverpool, scored 185 goals and been captain here fora Liverpool, scored 185 goals and been captain here for a record 11 years, no surprise, then, that this will be the fondest of farewells. For the fans who have loved his loyalty, though, it is still hard to take... I am choking up... Is that how much he means to you, sir? Oh, yeah. A club man. Brilliant. Always has been. The Eruopean Cup final he got us into. Don’t forein-Taliban. He won us that one. There have been stumbles, most famously last year. That cost him his best chance of a league title. The only glaring gap in a glittering CV. Is he the best player to have not won a league title? I can’t think of anyone better. Probably across the board, I would have to say yes. For every regret there are dozens of moments like this. As he heads to LA, he will leave behind one of English footballers, most captivating careers. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Tomasz Schafernaker. What a day. Some of us have been wandering what is going on with the weather. It has not been so bad in the Western Isles, temperatures up to 17 Celsius. But for many people over the south, the Midlands, to the south, what a wash-out. It was a weather front that thought it was November! It is moving out of the scene now. Still a little bit of light rain over the south-east for this evening. But the weather is improving for tomorrow and for most of us tomorrow morning, the weather is looking better. Chilly in rural spots tonight. Temperatures dipping down to about freezing. That is because of light winds and clearer skies. In the south a little more cloud, the left over of the bad weather we had today. This is what it looks like in the morning. Lots of sunshine but to the north-west, another weather front coming in, this time it is Western Scotland and Northern Ireland that are getting the rain. About 11 Celsius in stoppowway. Improvement across the country. Up to 17 Celsius in London. In the or the, the east and the south-east staying dry through Friday evening. The important weekend, then. A breeze over Scotland and Northern Ireland. A few isobars, so showers blowing in off the Atlantic. But for most, Saturday is not looking so bad. Sunshine around and temperatures getting up to 17. Fresh in Newcastle. Sunday, probably the cloudier day out of the two. Some sun but for the north-western areas, a chance of catching the rain. For the south tomorrow a little better but Scotland and Northern Ireland, not so great. Tonight on BBC London News: Unlicensed and uninsured. jail for the lorry driver who killed a cyclist afterjumping a red light.

Lodged up his nose as a child - the toy dart which reappeared A3 years later. Welcome to BBC London News with me, Riz Lateef. A lorry driver who killed a cyclist in central London has been jailed for three and a half years. Barry Meyer was uninsured and driving without the correct licence when he collided with Alan Neve in july 2013. Black Friars Crown Court heard how the 53-year-old driver had a string of motoring offences and had been banned from driving five times before. Today, cycling campaigners said he should never been allowed on the road. Alan was heading to work on his bike but on this day, july 2013, he was hit by a lorry and killed. His bike in indication ofjust how powerful the impact. Behind the wheel was Barry Meyer. He had just run a red light moments before. It has also emerged that the 53-year-old had been bound for driving five times in the past including twice the past including twice for drink-driving. He was also unlicensed and uninsured. The wife of Allen did not want to appear on camera but she said in a letter to the court that she lost her husband with all her heart and it was hard to imagine someone so kind and sensitive dying such a horrible death. Charity say employers need to be more vigilant when hiring drivers. It is unbelievable. We will write to the traffic commissioner to see this company can have its operators’s license revoked. Questions remain over how this man was allowed to operate a lorry which led to such devastating consequences. Coming up later in the programme: We are 22 metres under Oxford Street, finding out how Bond Street station is being transformed. Borisjohnson has told BBC London that the capital could get to keep more of the stamp duty raised here. The Mayor, who met with the Chancellor this week, says it would be in the form of funding of large construction projects like Crossrail 2. So just what kind of devolution are we talking about? Marc Ashdown explains. Boris johnson today supporting a project to recycle unwanted food. And on a day when devolution was high on the agenda, he, too, made his latest pitch for London to keep more of its own money. He says he’s met George Osborne this week and the Chancellor is minded to allow London to have control over some of the stamp duty and business rates it generates. I think what the Treasury would like to do, rather than just saying, you can have all of stamp duty, which would be a huge transfer, I think they would like to do it project by project, idea by idea. That sounds like that’s possibly realistic. Have you spoken to him about that? I think that’s the sort of way forward. So how much money are we talking about? Well, in the last financial year, the government raised £9.3 billion in property stamp duty in the UK. If we lookjust at residential property, the figure was £6.5 billion. Nearly half of that, £2.7 billion, was raised in London alone. It means in future, projects like the Garden Bridge or Crossrail 2 could be funded using money from stamp duty. With the small matter of having to tunnel 36 kilometres under the city centre, Crossrail should cost £27 billion. Ideas being considered to funded hard-charging landowners or property developers near the line. Some say money would be better invested in much-needed housing instead. If London gets this money, somewhere has not get this chunk of money. Will it come out of health or education or defence? But big projects generate more jobs. And even a tiny loosening of the controls would be a bold step. It suggests that the government is willing to consider devolving extra tax raising powers to London, which would give the London government just a bit more freedom over the resources it generated in the city. The Treasury has not officially commented but even a small concession would be seen as significant. With me now is Ben Rogers, director of the Centre for London think tank. Is this more control over the money that London raises or is itjust a bit more money being given to London? It sounds like more money. Not nearly as radical as some of the other proposals for cities outside London. It is a small step but not as big as I would like. What would you like? Control in London overall ",,

If London gets this money, somewhere has not get this chunk of money. Will it come out of health or education or defence? But big projects generate more jobs. And even a tiny loosening of the controls would be a bold step. It suggests that the government is willing to consider devolving extra tax raising powers to London, which would give the London government just a bit more freedom over the resources it generated in the city. The Treasury has not officially commented but even a small concession would be seen as significant. With me now is Ben Rogers, director of the Centre for London think tank. Is this more control over the money that London raises or is itjust a bit more money being given to London? It sounds like more money. Not nearly as radical as some of the other proposals for cities outside London. It is a small step but not as big as I would like. What would you like? Control in London overall property taxes. We could then design a property tax regime that would work for London. So are you saying the best way for London to address some of the more acute problems that we have heard, like housing and health, is to have greater control of the tax raised here? Yes, but not just London. Britain remains an extremely centralised country. I do think that’s her holding us back. The Chancellor perhaps does not agree with you. I am hopeful that we have a good coalition of people committed to devolution now. Boris johnson will be a central figure. I think we will see a speeding up of the process of devolution. When we were looking in the run-up to the election, one of the issues came up was the gap between how much raised in London and that that we back. London has been doing very well and the rest of the country has struggled. London needs more spent on it. I want devolution for cities outside London. We will get growth in all of our cities. It is not an either or. But that will take time for those to become mini economies of their own but in the meantime, that burden on London or that gap is growing. Of course I want to see more money spent in London. Investment in London does pay handsome dividends for the country as a whole. We need Crossrail, continuing investment in the Chew, there is a huge list of projects. -- in the Chew. Clarke Carlisle has been bound for driving for three years. He was arrested in Islington two days later. Surrey County Council has ordered a review of its adult social services following the sudden closure of a nursing home. Merock Park in Banstead was shut last December after its elderly residents were found to be living in dirty and unsafe conditions. The council revealed 12 different officials had previously visited the home but the alarm was only raised when someone spotted financial irregularities. Housing campaigner Lindsey Garrett is planning to run for Mayor of London in next year’s election. She fought to prevent residents having to leave the New Era Estate in Hoxton and is now standing for a new political party called Something New. Key issues she is campaigning for include rent control and a tax on private sector landlords’ rental incomes. It claims to be one of the best equipped heart centres in the world and it’s opened right here in London. The specialist centre at Bart’s hospital aims to treat up to 80,000 patients a year. Karl Mercer looks at its vision and challenges. This is what open heart surgery looks and sounds like in 2015. This isjust one of the operating theatres, which hopes to save more than 1000 lives a year. The hospital will see more than 200 patients every day. People like Barbara. She hasjust had bypass surgery here and is a fan. Marvellous, really. I am surrounded by experts. It is invasive surgery but you could not have better. The facilities are pretty sumptuous. Far more than I expected. The new centre has brought together the former London heart and chest hospitals. It will have more than 300 beds available. I was in the London chest Hospital. The staff there were marvellous. The hospital had seen its day though. It was not for this day and age any more. It was time for it to go. The move comes as the hospital trust is facing deep financial problems. It has also been put in special measures by the Care Quality Commission. But the hospital insists the new centre is the right way forward. This centre allows us not just have a cardiac surgeon on call but several different types of surgeon, each specialist treatment. It is no longer good enough for our patients have general services available around the clock. We need specialists round the clock as well. The challenge will be providing those services at a time when also has to balance its books. An oil leak in north-west London has killed dozens of fish and birds in the Grand Union Canal. Residents say the slick began forming near Kensal Rise at the weekend with the clear-up continuing today. Let’s get more from Chris Rogers, who’s there for us now. Chris. We are showing you some of the patches of oil that still remain. This whole area of the canal was smothered in oil, about 900 metres square. It travelled for three and a quarter miles down the canal, pushed by the wind. It can only be described as a giant vacuum cleaner. They contained the oil behind floating circles, a bit like the operation to see out at sea when a tanker has leaked oil. They are confident they have managed to save the canal. Unfortunately, it seems the wildlife have paid the highest price. Volunteers, the RSPCA and local community were trying to rescue birds covered in oil. Fish and birds have died unfortunately. Sadly, there have been 25-30 different types of birds affected. They have ranged from swarms, Coutts and Canadian geese. It is cooking oil, dumped illegally on an industrial scale, presumably down the industrial scale, presumably down the drain and that drainage system is only meant to bring rainwater here but unfortunately, it also brought cooking oil. Why anybody had that much is anybody’s guests and investigations continue but there is a trend in London of people trying to convert cooking oil into petrol and maybe the culprit was unsuccessful and decided to dump it at the cost of wildlife. Fast forward to late 2018 and nearly 250,000 passengers will pass through Bond Street station every day. The arrival of Crossrail may be a few years away but work on increasing capacity at one of the two West End interchanges is well underway. Our transport correspondent, Tom Edwards, went to take a look. If you have been on Oxford Street, you will have seen the blue boardings. A new station is being created. Bond Street already copes with the Central and jubilee lines. Eventually, they will be joined by Crossrail. But hind you is the main construction tunnel. The working place is so delicate and close to other structures that these miners have to use their hands. These tunnels are threaded right next to the existing lines. These are passengers going to the jubilee line. At the moment, 155,000 people a day use this station and it will go a day use this station and it will 90 UP go up to 225,000. Tunnelling is in its final stages. The cost for this part of Bond Street is £320 million. Fair increases in part have paid for investments like this. We are going for a population of 10 million people. We have got the best city at the world but it is the city of yesterday. We need to build a city for the future. So far, this station is on-time and on budget. It is due to be operational by 2017. Still to come this evening: His work has been described as radical and brave and he is not afraid of Virginia Woolf. Talking to us about that sneeze. The man who had a toy dart lodged in his nose for more than Ao years. How do you get more British Asian players in to football? It’s a question that’s being asked notjust by aspiring players but the FA itself. It’s published its first ever plan on how it wants to address the issue after talking to people in London, Luton and across the country. Chethan Pathak reports. How do you get more British Asians involved in football? It’s a question the FA is hoping it is closer to answering. There has been a plea from different Asian people to say, we should be doing different things. Where we started in terms of developing this plan is to talk to the people participating in football, community groups, to say, from a grassroots perspective, what can we be FA be doing with you to make a difference? Part of the FA’s plan is to offer support and funding to become community development centres. It is somewhere Asian players and coaches will have access to training and were top talent can be identified and developed. This man started the football academy over 25 years ago and is hoping to be selected as one of the new centres. He has felt a lack of support in the past but believes things are changing. I have been supported with certain individuals but there are also good key players out there. I can’t remember that many Asians playing. This man advised the FA on its plans and believes it is a significant step forward. The good thing about the report is that it brings together a lot of projects. A lot of football clubs in the past have worked independently but now, they have the network and the FA will bind that network together. The plans also have the backing of the only footballer of Asian heritage laying regularly in the Premier League. It is a great big step for Asians in football. Let’s see where we can go from here. The FA hopes its grassroots work will lead to more success at the top. This isn’t perhaps how you’d imagine the works of Virginia Woolf to be interpreted. The writer’s life and tragic death inspired the Oscar-winning film The Hours. Now, however, three of her most famous novels have been turned into a full-length ballet by contemporary choreographer Wayne McGregor. Here’s our arts correspondent, Brenda Emmanus, whose report contains flashing images. Words, English words, were full of Echo and memory. The voice of Virginia Woolf. She is the inspiration for Wayne McGregor. The choreographer’s latest production is inspired by three of her novels. I read some of Virginia Woolf in university but I wanted to make a piece the car lodged some of the aspects. Wayne McGregor and his dance company have a reputation for pushing the potential for dancers and embracing technology and other art forms to challenge themselves and audiences. This is his first three act ballet for the Royal Opera house and his ambitions have remained the same, to break boundaries and challenge perceptions. It’s really important the Opera house ‘s push the envelope. They should make and encourage a broad range of work. This latest offering has seen Wayne and his dancers work with someone who helped them to unravel and contextualise Virginia Woolf’s work. Is there, and work between the work that Wayne dance and the work that Virginia created? -- is their common ground. She drew on cinema and music and even space science and that is something that Wayne loves to do. Would she be proud of this? I really hope so. We had some of herfamily on the first night with thrilled. And so are the critics to date. And finally tonight, the man who was reunited with part of a toy dart A3 years after it disappered up his left nostril! A sneezing fit led to Steve Easton’s surprise discovery and provided an instant cure to what he thought was a chronic case of hayfever. Wendy Hurrell has been to Camberley in Surrey to meet him. Sneezes. They will take you by surprise. Orfilled Sneezes. They will take you by surprise. Or filled the air with snarling germ monsters. But when Steve sneezed, something genuinely surprising did actually fly out. It was the rubber soccer of a toy dart! It must have somehow got stuck there and by Lark, a month ago, it became dislodged. Out of pocket. But Steve could not remember swallowing sticking it up his nose. A few days later, I phoned my mum and talked of the story. She said, when you were seven we took you were seven which Acute Hospital because we thought you had swallowed one. And it has been up there for how long? 1+3, maybe 1+1+ years. Steve’s viral-- story has gone viral. But dubious global fame is the only difference. You are not suddenly smelling differently are you? No. I could not feel it when it was their and it makes no difference now has gone. I will probablyjust be at the receiving end of a fewjokes. Really topsy-turvy weather conditions. Yesterday, blue skies, sunshine and warmth. Today, all change though. Temperatures in central London barely climbing above double digits and there has been rain around as well. That rain still yet to clear. Some of the heavy for the next hour or two. Some clearer skies in the north. Here, temperatures may fall away to 6 degrees but here, we could start off with some sunshine first thing. A much better day tomorrow. The cloud will break up, the sunshine continues to come through and it will be pleasant enough. Not as warm as Wednesday but nevertheless, temperatures should peak at 15-18 degrees. You will notice the difference but nevertheless, better than today. Then we do it all again to some degree. More cloud arrives through the night. It will be a mild start to Saturday morning with temperatures 9-11. start to Saturday morning with temperatures 9-11 . Early temperatures 9-11. Early birds on Saturday could start of cloudy. The isobars remain a feature but we have a nose of high-pressure. That means we start of dull on Saturday. Sunshine comes through and it would be relatively pleasant with highs of 17 degrees. More cloud to come, I suspect, as we move into Sunday and Monday but on the whole, better than today. The day’s headlines: The leader of Ukip, Nigel Farage, is facing demands from within the party to hold a leadership contest. He’s been criticised by senior Ukip officials and accused of becoming snarling, thin-skinned and aggressive.

REPORTER: Is Ukip falling apart? He insists he’ll carry on, after stinging criticism from the party’s campaign chief. Making complaints and showing an aggressive demeanour to the public, I don’t think it is Nigel’s natural way. I was disappointed that a member of ourteam said way.

Good evening. Nigel Farage has tonight defended his position as the leader of the UK Independence Party. It comes after the party’s campaign chief, the MEP Patrick O’Flynn, launched a scathing attack, calling him ""snarling, thin-skinned and aggressive."" Speaking tonight on the BBC’s Question Time programme, Mr Farage said he didn’t recognise the description and said he wouldn’t step down to face a leadership election. This report from our political correspondent Alex Forsyth contains flash photography. Tonight arriving at Question Time, questions over Nigel Farage’s future. Report report have you lost the confidence of your party? Big time. Are you going to resign again? Critics have called for Nigel Farage it step aside but a defiant Ukip leader insisted he was best-placed for the job. What people are looking for in politics are leaders that are assertive, leaders that are not afraid to tell the truth, even if they know it may not always be popular. Leaders who have actually had a job in the real world and have some experience of life. Whatever may faults are, and perhaps there are many, I’m in politics because I believe in what I say and I want this country to change. A week ago, Nigel Farage was firmly ensconced as Ukip’s frontman, side-by-side with senior colleagues in a last push for votes. I will pass on your support. But today this key ally, although still loyal to Nigel Farage and his leadership, criticised hisjudgment, leadership, criticised his judgment, blaming leadership, criticised hisjudgment, blaming some advisors for making him snarling and somewhat hostile. To be making and to be showing an aggressive demeanour to the public, I don’t think it is Nigel’s natural way. I much prefer him as an ebullient, cheerful, optimistic politician and I think that’s the way he reaches out best. Ukip’s problem surfaced after the election. Nigel Farage failed to get his seat and even after A million votes they gotjust his seat and even after A million votes they got just one MP. his seat and even after A million votes they gotjust one MP. Mr Farage quit as Ukip’s leader but three days later was back in the job, which some thought was a mistake. Then there was a row with the party’s only MP, own public funding. This former Ukip donor thinks the party needs more stability ahead of the upcoming debate over Britain’s role in Europe. So Nigel Farage should step down. He is very much Ukip but I think we need somebody new now. What he has done for the party is incredible. But I think in order to win the referendum, we need a slightly quieter approach. This man, inevitably becomes the focus of any argument over Ukip’s direction due to his influence on the party but he’s rejected calls for a leadership contest to clear the air. The level of support for me in the party is phenomenal. Frankly, to go through leadership contest, at and critics airing their views, this ughly public spat is Well, one of the advisors who was subject of that criticism has today tendered his resignation. Another flatly denies encouraging aggression but has left the party. Some will hope that puts this to bed. Nigel Farage has dismissed it as in-fighting but there is a bigger debate over the future of Ukip, with some suggesting it should move away from what they see as a divisive rhetoric, to something much calmer. That would be a much harder argument to dismiss. When, as a leader as familiar as Nigel Farage is, his future is inextricably linked to that of his party. Thank you. The Chancellor George Osborne has been giving details of what he’s described as a radical devolution of power to cities in England. He’s offered power for Greater Manchester over housing, health and policing and wants that to be a model for other cities. Our Home Editor Mark Easton reports from Manchester. Do the streets of Greater Manchester hold the answer to the question of how to devolve power in England? Ten local councils have got together, forming a super-council, and demanding far greater control over their region. And today, George Osborne was in the city for his first speech since the election, announcing what he called ""a revolution in how we govern England."" It is up to local people to decide whether they’re interested in their communities taking part in this new revolution in city government but, equally, Iam not interested in a half-way house. We will transfer major powers only to those cities who choose to have directly-elected Metro-wide mayors. Control over billions of pounds of spending will switch from Whitehall to Greater Manchester. Power over budgets for transport, for housing, for policing and, the biggest prize of all, over health and social care. Across the so-called northern powerhouse today, the idea got a cautious thumbs up. I think there is definitely too much power in Westminster and that it would be a good thing if it’s distributed to the cities, yes. This part of the country always seems to get left out of everything. If you’ve got control of your own money and budgets, which will happen, I think they will tend to look after that money a lot better. Local council leaders in Greater Manchester may be delighted to be cast as the trail blazers of English devolution, but council bosses elsewhere will be examining the small print in what the Chancellor had to say because, despite the rhetoric, it appears that the bar for English devolution, far from being lowered, has actually been raised. There are currently 30 potential or agreed supercouncils across England. All of them had been hoping to get new powers. So we’re bring forward a set of ambitious proposals for the north-east and combined authority area. The north-east combined authority, like other supercouncils, had decided against having an elected Mayor, but may now have to think again. If he does insist on it, then he’s in danger of holding back the things that he actually wants to achieve, which is letting us get on with the job of growing our economy and creating the much-needed jobs that our country and communities need. The other question posed by the Chancellor’s insistence on city-wide Metro Mayors is what about devolution to rural England? There are hints of county level deals, but this Manchester based revolution appears more city than united. Mark Easton, BBC News, Manchester. Drug companies are being urged to pay for a £1 billion innovation fund to develop new antibiotics to tackle the growing problem of so-called superbugs. Drug-resistant infections currently cause at least 700,000 deaths a year worldwide. It’s estimated that they could cause up to 10 million deaths a year by 2050. That’s because, as a review commissioned by the Government has found, the widespread use of antibiotics has now rendered many of them useless. Our medical correspondent, Fergus Walsh, has been to India and the United States to examine the problem. In the global war on superbugs, this hospital in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, marks the front-line. This is our intensive care unit. 60,000 newborns a year in India die from drug-resistant infections, as one antibiotic after another has failed. I would feel they will all die without antibiotics. Yes. It does scare us. It makes us feel frustrated because previously where drugs used to work, now they’ve stopped working. With a population of 1.25 billion, it’s here in India that more antibiotics are now used than anywhere else, but a combination of poor sanitation and widespread misuse of those drugs make it a perfect setting for the rise of superbugs. It’s notjust India, the world has overused antibiotics for decades and now the antibiotic pipeline is running dry, partly because many companies have pulled out of this area, as profits are uncertain. An independent review proposes an innovation fund to boost research and profit guarantees for those delivering vital new antibiotics. It’s critical that pharmaceutical industry players take bigger initiatives on this. They’re the ones that know how to produce these things. So we have to come up with incentives or rewards to change their mind-set. In the United States, researchers in Boston have made what some believe is a game changing discovery from a surprising source. They’ve identified 25 potential new antibiotics from soil microbes, including one called teixobactin which has proved highly effective in animal trials. Teixobactin is going to be potentially very useful to treat staph aureus MRSA infections, that’s one of the superbugs. Do you think there could be thousands more antibiotics out there, in the soil, waiting to be discovered? There’s no doubt in my mind that that is the case. Caution is needed. Human trials have yet to start and many promising drugs fail at that stage. But it could at least be part of the solution, helping to ensure the next generation of antibiotics will be there when needed. Fergus Walsh, BBC News. You can see more about this in Panorama - Antibiotic Apocalypse. That’s on Monday evening on BBC One at 8.30pm. Police say terrorism arrests in England, Wales, and Scotland have reached their highest level since the attacks of September 11th 2001. The country’s most senior counter-terrorism officer warned that extremist groups, such as Islamic State, are trying to encourage people to carry out violent attacks in this country. Our home affairs correspondent, june Kelly, is here with me now. That sounds like a very worrying picture that’s being painted. That’s right. Last year 338 terror arrests and nearly half of them related to Syria. And what police here say is a very worrying trend, is the increase in the number of teenagers being arrested. Now, overallabout half in the number of teenagers being arrested. Now, overall about half of the people arrested were charged. Today Assistant Commissioner, Mark Rowley, the most senior officer in the country when it comes to counter-terrorism, he says groups COUI’1tâI""tâI’I’oI’iSTT’I, i’1â SAYS gI’oUpS counter-terrorism, he says groups like Islamic State are encouraging people, when they go out to Syria, to train and we know more than 700 Britons have gone out there. About half have come back. He said the aim is to direct attacks in the UK. He also also, Isis is encouraging people in this country, through propaganda, to I launch attacks here. Now there are reports tonight, but I should stress they are unconfirmed, that the Isis leader hasissued unconfirmed, that the Isis leader has issued a new rallying call to his supporters, urging them tojoin the fight or take up arms wherever they live. Thank you. The United Nations has warned there could be a massive humanitarian disaster in Southeast Asia if nothing is done to stop the growing migrant crisis there. As many as 8,000 people, fleeing persecution in Bangladesh and Myanmar, are believed to be stranded in the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea because Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand have refused to allow migrants into their country. Our correspondent, jonathan Head, tracked down one of the boats. As we approach the stricken vessel, cries of desperation and distress carried across the water. We’d heard there were boats packed with migrants out here on the Andaman Sea, but finding them was a real challenge. Finally, we tracked one down. This is incredible. We’ve heard about this boat for the last five or six days. They’ve been cast adrift. They have told people on the phone they had no food and water and they are injust terrible shape at the moment. They are begging for help. They are now in Thai waters, but they’ve had absolutely no help, no supplies for close to a week. There are plenty of women and children on board. These are people who may have been at sea for close to three months. They’re begging for help. We think there are many more boats like this out in the sea at the moment. 15-year-old Mohammed shouted his story from the stern. They’d been abandoned by the crew six days ago, he told us. The engine no longer worked properly. These are Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar. Unwanted and persecuted in their own country, they’re not wanted anywhere else, either. The Thai Navy is offerring to help and to find other lost boats, but will they let the Rohingyas stay? In the past, they’ve simply pushed them back out to sea. A hardline approach that’s shared by neighbouring countries. So, we still have no idea what will become of these people. We threw them everything we had, but after so long at sea, they need a lot more. They need proper shelter, medical care, and they need somewhere they can call home. jonathan Head, BBC News, Southern Thailand. Meanwhile, a few hours ago, the Royal Navy flagship, the HMS Bulwark, arrived in Sicily after rescuing about 600 migrants in the Mediterranean Sea. The people were picked up trying to sail from Libya to Europe aboard inflatable dinghies. james Reynolds reports from Catania. HMS Bulwark carried its cargo of rescued migrants, hidden below deck, into the Sicilian port of Catania. These people, here making their way to shore, have been saved because Britain and Europe have been expelled to restart widespread search and rescue missions. ~ -- compelled. Which country did you come from? Somalia. How are you now? Are you OK? OK, yeah. OK. This woman is eight months pregnant. She left her 10-year-old daughter, Precious, behind in Nigeria. The boat trip was too risky for a child. What was it like when you saw the British people coming to save you? I was happy because I believe when they came I’m already in Italy. How does it feel now that you’re in Europe? You’re alive? I’m happy. Britain may now be prepared to rescue migrants at sea, but it doesn’t want to resettle them in the UK. The Government fears that allowing the people its rescued to move to Britain would only encourage more migrants to attempt the dangerous trip across the Mediterranean. For now, the migrants will have to fight for space in Italy. Here theyjostle for new pairs of shoes and socks to get ready for the next stage of theirjourney, to the rest of Europe. james Reynolds, BBC News, Sicily. A brief look at some of the day’s other other news stories. The RAF has confirmed that two Typhoon fighter jets were scrambled after a Russian aircraft appeared close to UK airspace. The Russian plane was escorted from what the RAF termed Britain’s ""area of interest."" The Liberal Democrat MP, Tim Farron, has announced he’s entering the contest to be the party’s leader, following the resignation of Nick Clegg. Mr Farron says he wants to be a ""unifying force"" in the party. The Shadow International Development Secretary, Mary Creagh, is tojoin the race to be the Labour leader, becoming the fifth person to declare candidacy. The UK should hold an EU referendum ""as soon as necessary."" That’s the message from the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, who warned today that businesses could delay making investments as long as there is uncertainty about Britain’s future. Our business editor, Kamal Ahmed, has more. Fresh out of the election and a fresh uncertainty for the likes of Lesley Moody, who run as software firm in Teesside. As a small business that trades with Europe, she says concerns about the timing of a referendum will worry her customers. If they’re not sure what’s going to happen in relation to business, with a UK company, if we’re no longer part of Europe, we might lose out on, you know, it could be hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of business. Today, the governor of the Bank of England put a rather careful toe into the water on whether it would be better for business to hold the referendum early. You talk to an awful lot of bosses. Questioned byjohn Humphrys, on the Today programme, he said the referendum was a Government priority. It’s in the interests of everybody that there is clarity about the process and the question and the decision - And the speed? Sooner rather than later? With all deliberate speed, I think, is the right - Well, indeed, but can I take it that that means sooner rather than later? I wouldn’t put a specific timetable on it. The Government’s made it clear that it’s a priority. I’m sure the Government will act with appropriate speed. The governor will certainly want to avoid the very deep waters on this subject and officials here, at the Bank of England, have said to me that the governor’s remarks should not be over interpreted. Mark Carney will certainly want to avoid a political row over the timing of so delicate an issue. Other business leaders did urge caution. It is going to take time to get a better deal. We do need to work with all of our European partners in a way that couldn’t be done before the general election, and we’re onlyjust at the beginning of thatjourney. Britain in Europe, good afternoon. You have to go back a long way, Ao years, for the last time Britain voted on being a member of what was then the European Economic Community. After so many years, the Government may not want to rush to a new vote this time. Kamal Ahmed, BBC News. Burundi’s President is said to have returned to the country following an attempted coup. It began after he announced he was running for a third term in office. There was more fighting today as rebel army units tried to seize key buildings in the capital. Tonight toe though the head of the army told the BBC that the rebellion has been crushed. Our correspondent Maud jullien is in the capital, Bujumbura, her report contains some images which you may find distressing. I found someone who has been killed much I found him in in the in the road. We are afraid, we don’t know what’s going to happen. The radio are closed. We can’t get any news. We made our way to the national Television Centre. We witnessed the ferocity of the fighting. At least five soldiers were killed. Supporters of the attempted coup. Loyalist troops told us 60 mutineers surrendered. There has been clashes during much of the day between soldiers loyal to Pierre Nkurunziza and soldiers who support the military coup. Loyalist soldiers tell us they are in control. Pierre Nkurunziza was attending a Head of State visit when the coup was staged. The General, a former head of intelligence, said he was acting to restore stability in the country and to protect its institutions. Today, the loyalist forces seem to have the upper hand. TRANSLATION: The loyalist returned to the capital and has thanked the army and the police for their patriotism. He is coming home to a very restive country. Maud jullien, BBC News, Burundi. How should mental health patients, who are sometimes suicidal, be dealt with in emergency situations? In many parts of the country they’re arrested for their own safety and put in a police cell. But now some senior police officers are calling for change. They say it’s wrong to criminalise patients and that new schemes, running in some forces in England, are the way forward - where mental health specialists, often nurses, are deployed. Our correspondent, Ed Thomas, has been given access to one team in Cheshire and sent this special report. How to cope with those who desperately need help. Suicidal and self-harm. Tonight, we see the pressure facing police in the struggle to protect lives in crisis. Her intention is to make her way towards the bridge and jump off. We spent three days with Cheshire Police. Here, an officer and mental health nurse work together and they’re getting more and more calls like this. She’s threatening to throw herself off the bridge. She’s already harmed herself. For nurse jane Unsworth and PCjenkins, it’s their first emergency of the night. A missing woman, she’s suicidal and has self-harmed. What have you done that with? So they need stitching up, don’t they? The officers are with her now, but what’s important is that a mental health nurse is now with her. In the past, Cheshire Police would have dealt with this alone. To protect, officers, without any other option, would arrest and section under the Mental Health Act. That could mean a vulnerable person being held in a cell. But not tonight. Instead of custody, the woman here is helped byjane and then taken to hospital to have her cuts treated. I felt like there wasn’t any hope in the world. An hour later, she’s calm and has agreed to talk. She asked us not to show her face. It’s absolutely terrifying being handcuffed and leg strained and all that sort of thing. Is it really worse when you’re sectioned? Yes, I’m definitely, definitely worse when I’m sectioned. What did this mean to you tonight, to speak with a mental health nurse? That was incredible because nice as the police often are, it’s quite intimidating with the uniform and with all that. We ended up going from me wanting tojump off a bridge, to having a joke, and I never thought that would happen. In the care of a nurse, she’s taken home. For tonight, she’s safe. A new day and a new crisis. She’s trying to set fire to the house while the officer is there. She’s got a long history of self- harming behaviours. This is high-risk. A young girl, known to mental health teams, and a mother desperate for support. The self-harming has become more extreme. Her emotions are more extreme. Both agreed to talk to us. I feel like self-harming all the time and Ijust want to die. Ijust don’t want to be here any more. To hear your daughter say that, what does that do to you? It kills me inside. Ijust want to take her pain away and put it inside me. So who do you turn to for help? The police. They’re the first people I ring each time, every time. Frustrating, been here many times. What she needs is full-time residential care. That’s what we’re waiting for. Until we get that, we’re just going to have this situation every few days. Where the police are called again and again. Every few days. jane, we’ve got to go. So, who should take responsibility for those with mental illness who ring 999? The demand is huge. I don’t think the police in isolation can do it and I don’t think mental health services in isolation at the moment can do it. We need to work together to deal with what’s happening currently. Into the night, more calls for help. Our emergency services keeping safe the most vulnerable of lives. Ed Thomas, BBC News, Warrington.

The Liverpool captain, Steven Gerrard, will make his final home appearance for the club this Saturday. He’s had a 17 year career there and moves to Los Angeles to play for LA Galaxy at the end of the season after playing for Liverpool more than 700 times. Today he’s been speaking to the press. He said it was likely to be an emotional farewell at Anfield. I’ve been dreading this moment, in a strange way. Because I’m going to miss it so much, playing at Anfield, playing in front of the fans. I’m going to miss playing with my team-mates. So it will be emotional, but the plan’s to try and keep it together, stay strong and try and avoid the tears. That’s all from us. Now, on BBC One, its time for the news where you are. Tonight on BBC London News. Unlicensed and uninsured, jail for the lorry driver who killed a cyclist afterjumping a red light. For It shouldn’t happen that an unlicensed driver is given a large vehicle to throw around the streets of London. We are 22 metres under Oxford Street finding out how bond Street station is being transformed. A very modern ballet, made from classic novels by Virginia Woolf. Plus, after a day of rain, is there more tomorrow? Good evening, I’m Asad Ahmad. A lorry driver whojumped a red light and killed a cyclist near Holborn Tube Station has beenjailed for three-and-a-half years. Barry Meyer from Walthamstow was described as a ""cavalier"" and ""lawless"" driver, but what’s shocked cycling campaigners the most is that he already had a string of motoring offences, he was uninsured and he’d been banned from driving five times before. Here’s Alpa Patel. Alan Neve had been heading to work on his bike. Ajourney he made regularly through the streets of central London but on this day in july 2013 he was hit by a lorry in High Holborn and killed. His mangled bike an indication of how powerful the impact. Behind the wheel was Barry Meyer. He had just run a red light moments before. Today he was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison and banned for driving for ten years. It’s also emerged that the 53-year-old had been banned for driving five times in the past, including twice for drink-driving. In this case, he was also unlicensed, and uninsured. The wife of Alan Neve didn’t want to appear on camera but she said in a letter to the court, that she loved her husband with all her heart and it was hard to imagine someone so kind and sensitive a man had such a horrible death. Charities say employers need to be more vigilant when hiring drivers. It is unbelievable. The judge said heaven knows why they allowed him to do it but they did and we at the London Cycling Campaign will be writing to traffic Commissioner to see if this company can have its operators’ licence revoked for allowing it to happen. It shouldn’t happen that an unlicensed driver should be given a large vehicle to throw around the streets of London. For now questions remain over how a man who had such a poor record for driving was allowed to operate a lorry which led to such devastating consequences. London could get to keep a larger share of the taxes which are generated here. The Mayor says he’s already spoken to the Chancellor about the idea and the possibility of it raising millions or even billions of pounds - to fund major projects in the city. But there are also concerns, as Marc Ashdown reports. Borisjohnson today Boris johnson today supporting a project to recycled unwanted food and on a day when devolution was high on the agenda, he made his latest pitch for London to keep more of its own money. He says he met George Osborne this week and the Chancellor is minded to allow London to have control over some of the stamp duty and business rates it generates. I think what the Treasury would like to do, rather than saying - you can have all of stamp duty, which would be a huge transfer, I think they would like to do it project by project, idea by idea. So is that possibly realistic? Have you spoken about that? That’s the sort of way forward. How much money are we talking about? Well in the last financial year the Government raised £9.3 billion in propoerty stamp duty on property in the UK. If we look at just at residential property, the figure was £6.5 billion. Nearly half, £2.7 billion was raised in London alone. It means in future, projects like the Garden Bridge or Crossrail 2 could be funded using money from stamp duty. With the small matter of having to tunnel 36 kilometres right under the city centre, Crossrail 2 could cost in the region of £27 billion. Ideas being considered to fund it are charging landowners and property developers near the line or raising council tax or putting up fares. This could be a popular alternative then, or maybe not. Some say money would be better invested in much-needed housing instead and there would be losers. If London gets these chunks of money, somewhere has to not get the chunks of money. It the doesn’t necessarily mean another part of the country. Is it going to come out of health or education or defence or international development? Where is Boris proposing this money gets taken from? But big projects generate more jobs, housing. In other words, income for the Government and even a tiny loosening of the controls would be a bold step. What’s really interesting about this is that it suggests that the Government is willing to consider, even if a rather limited way, devolving extra tax-raising powers to London or at least the yield in the growth from some taxes which would give the London Government a little bit more freedom over the resources generated in the City and it could decide how to use them in the future.

The Treasury hasn’t commented officially but even a small concession would be seen as significant, in the mayor’s push for more power for him to spend what London earns. The Former Premier League footballer Clarke Carlisle has been banned from driving for three years and ordered to do community work after pleading guilty to a drink-driving offence. He was arrested after a crash in Islington in December, before refusing a breath test. Two days later he tried to kill himself byjumping in front of a lorry. Surrey County Council has ordered a review of its adult social services following the sudden closure of a nursing home. Merock Park in Banstead was shut last December after its elderly residents were found to be living in dirty and unsafe conditions. The council said 12 different officials had previously visited the home but the alarm was only raised when someone spotted financial irregularities. Hundreds of litres of cooking oil, suspected to have been illegally dumped down a roadside drain has made its way into the Grand Union Canal. Dozens of fish and birds have been killed as a slick began forming near Kensal Rise at the weekend. Millions of people will be using Crossrail when it finally opens in a few years time, linking areas to the west of London, through to Essex. Some of the busiest stations will be in the heart of London. Bond Street being one of them. Taking a look to see how work’s going to transform the station itself, is Tom Edwards. If you have been on Oxford Street you will have seen the blue hoardings. Below, one of the busiest shopping streets in the world, and a new station is being created. Bond Street already copes with the Central and jubilee I lines. Eventually they will be joined by Crossrail. That’s the access through to the end of thejubilee Line. Behind you is our main construction tunnel. All the materials and spoilers coming in and out to make thisjob, this keyhole surgery spoilers coming in and out to make this job, this keyhole surgery is coming out through that construction tunnel. The work in places is so delicate and so close to other structures, these miners have to use their hands. These tunnels are being threaded right next to the existing lines. If Kevin opens the door here these are passengers going to the jubilee Line. At the moment 155,000 people a day use this station. It’ll go people a day use this station. It’ll 90 UP go up to 225,000. Tunnelling is now in its final stages. The cost for this part of bond Street is £320 million. Fare increases, in part, have paid for investments like this. We are going to a population of 10 million people. Really, we have the best city in the world at the moment but it is the city of yesterday. We need to build a city for the 2030s and beyond. That’s why we are making this investment for the future of London and the future of commerce in London and particularly bond Street in this case. So far it’s claimed this station is on time and on budget. It’s due to be operational by 2017. Virginia Woolf, one of the country’s foremost novelists from the last century has had some of her most famous work turned into a full-length ballet. And not just any ballet but one with a very contemporary interpretation. Here’s our Arts Correspondent, Brenda Emmanus, whose report contains flashing images. Words, English words were full of echos and memories. The voice of the writer, Virginia wolf. She is awe now the inspiration for the work of one of the dance world’s radical practitioners, Wayne McGregor. The choreographers latest production Wolf Works is inspired by three novels. Mrs Dalloway, the Waves and as is seen here, Orlando. I read some of them much earlier in university. I wanted to try to make a piece in some way collage some of the aspects of Woolf. Wayne McGregor and his dance company have a reputation of pushing the potential of dances and embracing technology and other artforms to challenge themselves and audiences. The latest work continues in this vain. Woolf Works is for the Royal Opera House. His ambitions here are to break boundaries and challenge perceptions. Think it is important that the Royal Opera House should push the envelope and encourage perhaps provocative work that maybe puts people out of their comfort zone. This latest offering has seen Wayne and his dancers workeded with a Dramaturge someone who help them contextualise the work in order to present it. Of is there common ground between the work that Wayne does and the work that Virginia Woolf created? As you know she drew on artforms and was a huge fan of visual art but she drew on cinema, music and even space science. It is something that Wayne likes to do. Do you think she would be proud? I have tried to imagine a little Virginia Woolf on my shoulder going -- tried to imagine a little Virginia Woolf on my shoulder going -- what are you doing? We had some of her family in on the first night who are thrilled. To date, so are the critics.

A sneezing fit led to Steve Easton’s surprise discovery and provided an instant cure to what he thought was a chronic case of hayfever. It must have somehow, you know, being a sucker, got stuck there and, you know, just by luck, a month ago it became dislodged. It started to become an irritant immediately it moved and brought on a sneezing fit. Out it popped. Definitely not a cure for all forms of hay fever. The rain today was.

It should be about 17 during this stage in May. Overnight the dregs of drizzle will be finally clear away. We will be left with a bit of cloud. Temperatures not really falling too far from where they have been all day. Looking at overnight lows of 8 or so. You don’t need me here to tell you it will be a better day tomorrow. At the present time couldn’t be much worse. Cloud will break up, sunny spells coming through. Particularly during the morning. Into the afternoon, more in the way of cloud bubbling up but staying dry with sunny spells and the temperatures back to where they should be this time of year, highs UP should be this time of year, highs up to 18 or so.

I said it was going to be warmer with sunshine at the beginning of the weather weather report. Look at this. Scotland not looking dry. Rain on the way from western parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland. Eventually that rain will reach eastern areas. Western parts of Wales and the south-west will turn cloudy. The best place to be is central England, East Anglia and the south-east. Here, I suspect temperatures will nudge up to 17 or 18. Compared to around about 10 in London.

Good evening, I’m Alice Bhandhukravi. Three people have been arrested after fighting broke out in King’s Cross between dozens of men, thought to be football fans. One eye-witness has told BBC London he’s never seen anything like it. Emma North has the story. There are still traces left of what happened here yesterday evening. In a backstreet behind King’s Cross station, this was no ordinary pub punch-up. The landlord says he saw 20 men aged about 30 charging down this street and when they got the pub one of them, and provoked, punched a drinker in the face in front of his two small children. And then the violence started. For at least ten minutes glasses and bottles were used as weapons. Pub managed to get some customers to safety indoors but one man is in hospital with head injuries and three people are being questioned by police, all on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. The pub is commonly seen as a stop off point for football supporters on their way to get a train but there has been little explanation for what caused the violence. The first time I’ve seen it. Huge. Train loads of people having a drink after the match but never any fights. Webb the pub captured most of what happened on CCTV which is now with the police, who will have to look within and outside of London to find those responsible. The Labour Party could be facing the greatest crisis in its history. That’s according to the London MP leading a review into Labour’s General Election defeat last week. jon Cruddas, the MP for Dagenham and Rainham who helped write Labour’s election manifesto, told the BBC that Labour lost because it focused on ""micro policies"" and that it now needed to rethink who it was for and what it represented. People do not know who we are. There is not that basic sentiment in and around Labour so our candidates will sometimes find it hard to to give it a sense of purpose and vision and we have to go back to fundamentally rethinking who and what we are. And candidates seeking Labour’s nomination to be the next mayor have until Wednesday to throw their hat in the ring. The field is already crowded - six candidates have already announced they’re standing. The winner will be announced in September, as our Political Editor Tim Donovan reports. candidate for City Hall has started on the front runners in is to be Tessa jan will. Not enough homes, too many Londoners who don’t have somewhere to come to every night and call it on. I want to do something about that. I would apply an Olympic type discipline to achieving that. In a field server containing four MPs Diane Abbott is the most senior with the highest profile. What I have that the other candidates don’t is that I am known to be a genuinely independent character. We know that Londoners, whether they vote Tory or Labour, want somebody who is a genuine independent and not a party apparatchiks. David Lambie looks set to but housing centre stage. London is rigged for ordinary people these days come you can’t get a house, card at a council house, we build 1+0 last year. We need new ideas for a new London. Another entrant to the race could focus on at a London. I want London to have more power and Londoners to have more probable we are the centre of wealth creation in the UK and we need to make sure that more of it is used to tackle London’s problems. We have the highest cost of living in London, the highest rents and our transport system needs investment. The only non-politician and first to declare is a journalist who knows his transport. What London to be more liberal, affordable and sustainable, that means a better deal on fares, more emphasis on cyclists a nd walkers, and things like pedestrianisation Oxford Street which is currently the most polluted street in London. The favoured candidate was Sadiq Khan, the favoured candidate was Sadiq Khan, defeat does that help him that looks inside and outside London, in the past two weeks we had activists knocking on doors listening to what Londoners want.

Sunshine eventually, with a risk of further heavy showers. A lot of that rain across England and Wales to start the day, heavy showers first thing in southern and eastern Scotland, the rain followed by a narrow band of heavy showers went clear the south-east until mid to late afternoon. In the morning, Scotland will have such an, later on heavy showers may be done to be with hail. There will be a spell of dry, sunnier weather for England and Wales after the rain. As you can see at this stage heavy showers appearing in the West, all pushing further east in the late afternoon and into evening. Temperatures mid to low teens. There could be a touch of rural frost in Scotland, gusty winds elsewhere with heavy showers, Tuesday, mid to low teens, by Wednesday it looks as if most of the showers will be in the East.

After days of intense fighting, Government forces retreat and IS declares victory. It’s a serious setback for the Iraqi Government and for their Western allies. We’ll be live in Washington. A frontrunner for the Labour leadership, Andy Burnham, urges the party to embrace an early vote on Britain’s membership of the EU. Fresh evidence of Asia’s migrant crisis - survivors from one boat finally make it to Indonesia after months at sea. We didn’t have food for two weeks. We were starving. I saw small innocent children slaughtered at sea. The parents of two children who died on a Thomas Cook holiday in Greece say they got a fraction of compensation won by the tour operator. And Rory Mcllroy looks on course for a second victory in America this month. Islamic State fighters are tonight said to be in full control of the Iraqi city of Ramadi - just 70 miles west of the capital Baghdad. The retreat of Iraqi Government forces came after days of intense fighting, leaving a key provincial capital in the hands of IS. It’s a serious blow to the effort, backed by US-led air strikes, to drive IS out of areas first seized last year. Our correspondent, jon Brain, reports. Retreat from Ramadi. These unverified pictures purport to show the Iraqi military fleeing the capital of Iraq’s biggest province. Apparently leaving it in the full control of Islamic State militants. The country’s Prime Minister had urged them to hold fast and await re-enforcements. But Government troops have ignored his entreaties. Some security officials and soldiers are also retreating from the city and they have taken their families with them. We’re doing everything we can now to try and find a way to support them by contacting the international coalition, to have some air support to protect them. Iraqi forces have been fighting Islamic State for control of Ramadi for months. Two days ago, the tide turned when militants overran the main Government compound. The city’s fall marks the biggest setback for Iraq since it began a nation-wide offensive to reclaim territory taken by IS last june. offensive to reclaim territory taken by IS lastjune. Why are you leaving, shouts this man? Stay and fight like men. This video, which we cannot verify appears to show Government soldiers abandoning their posts. The failure of Iraq’s official forces has prompted the Prime Minister to order the mobilisation of Shia militias. Their deployment in such a predominantly Sunni area will be seen by many as provocative. Questions for western Governments - what should their response be to this latest and extremely alarming advance by Islamic State? jon Brain BBC News. Live now to our North America editor, jon Sopel. A retreat by Iraqi forces - what does that mean for allies like the United States? Well, the Pentagon has put out a statement in the last hour or so and it doesn’t accept that Ramadi has fallen. They say it is still contested. But they said, we said two months ago Ramadi could fall. The lost of Ramadi would not be tactically significant to us. That is putting a brave face on it. Yesterday, we saw the White House and the Pentagon delighted at the news their Special Forces killed an ID leader overnight. -- news their Special Forces killed an ID leader overnight. -- IS leader overnight. This shows us the wider picture and that is there are severe limitations over what the Americans can achieve by air power alone and the odd operation by Special Forces. I think, secondly, the odd operation by Special Forces. Ithink, secondly, it I think, secondly, it shows the dependence on Iranian-backed Shia militia on the ground to get things done, as happened in tit ribbing. I think that be tickirit. Here a frontrunner for the Labour leadership, Andy Burnham has said the party should change its policy on a EU referendum. He’s also called himself the ‘change candidate’. Meanwhile the head of Britain’s biggest union, Unite, has warned it could cut ties with Labour unless it makes the ‘correct’ leadership choice. Here’s our political correspondent, Ben Wright. This was a top Labour target, but when Thurrock stayed blue on polling day, just, Labour’s election hopes were sunk. One big reason this Essex seat stayed was because of Labour. Having a clearer picture of what is going on with it. Labour don’t show that and Ukip do. They have to go back to support the working class person. They’ve got to really just... That’s, but that’s what lost them the votes as well. There are a lot of people in this country that want to get on. You know. Labour want to pull people that want to get on in life, Labour want to pull them back. So, where next? Labour is sifting through the causes of its defeat. One of the people hoping to lead the party now says Labour should have backed a referendum on Britain’s EU membership after all. backed a referendum on Britain’s EU membership afterall. Been membership after all. Been watching how Vy public opinion has been changing. I began to see there was clearly an appetite for a referendum. This is why I am the change candidate. I have said clearly and quickly that we need to bring forward that referendum. Labour is trying to work out why its pitch on Europe, on immigration, on the economy failed to win over voters in seats like this. And those in Scotland and wealthier parts of England. The party’s problems are huge, and as potential Labour leaders start to battle it out it is clear it is more thanjust needing a fresh face and the different parts of the Labour Party are already in a struggle to set its future direction. A society and an economy where the strong... And tensions between the party and trade unions erupted yesterday when the outgoing leader in Scotland, jim Murphy, branded the leader of unite the kiss of death. Today he said it had to reflect the voice of his members otherwise the afilliation with Labour might be broken. It is UP with Labour might be broken. It is up to them. If they don’t, if they inject more disillusionment in the party then the pressure will grow from our members to re-think it. He denied Andy Burnham was his preferred con di date. New rules -- candidate. This contest will be one member, one vote. Thurrock was Labour through the blair years. While trade unions want the party to go one way, others insist Labour must rediscover the appeal it had to voters then. It is a trade in human lives taking place close to some of south-east Asia’s best known tourist resorts. There is more evidence tonight of the bleak conditions on board migrant boats trying to reach Thailand and Malaysia. Survivors of one vessel, who reached Indonesia after months at sea, have spoken of violence and killings when the food on board ran out. But governments in the region remain reluctant to act- fearing that allowing the boats to land will encourage even greater numbers to make the journey from Myanmar and Bangladesh. Our correspondent Martin Patience has this report from the port of Langsa on the Indonesian island of Aceh. They are back onshore after the boat journey from hell. Exhausted, traumatised and starved. After months at sea. The cries for help only heard when their boat sank. Rescued by Indonesian fishermen, the tears cannot wipe away the horror. This woman’s daughter lies sick by her side. Finally receiving the care she needs. TRANSLATION: We didn’t have food for two weeks. We were sdarveing. I saw small, innocent-- starving, I saw small, innocent children slaughtered at sea. Tensions are still running high onshore. A fight for the last remaining food on board the boat sparked a blood bath. Survivors say UP sparked a blood bath. Survivors say up to 100 migrants were killed. TRANSLATION: Some were hacked to death, others were beaten. I saw people thrown overboard. You could see their bodies sinking in the sea. I lost three of my friends. People here thought they were leaving Myanmar and Bangladesh for a better life. Some were fleeing ethnic persecution, others were seeking economic opportunity. They wanted to reach Malaysia, but their boat wasn’t allowed to land. So instead they are all now in the hands of aid agencies. The men, women and children here can count themselves lucky. They may not have reached their preferred destination, Malaysia, but for every person here there are many more in crammed boats far out at sea. Some at the camp will be sent home. Others may get asylum. For those still at sea, their fate remains unknown. Martin Patience, BBC News, Indonesia. A British bodyguard has been killed in a Taliban suicide bombing in the Afghan capital Kabul. The attack targeted a convoy of vehicles belonging to the European Union Police Mission. Two teenage Afghan girls also died, and a number of people were injured. The parents The pa re nts of of carbon monoxide pi sonning while on holiday in Greece say they won only 10 % of the compensation won by the firm from the hotel. The figure emerged after an inquest ruled last week that seven-year-old Christi Shepherd, and her brother, Bobby, who was six, were unlawfully killed. Matthew Price reports. This is a story of two happy children, killed by the failings of a hotel owner and a tour company. Bobby and Christi Shepherd were just six and seven years old. They died here, in their beds, as carbon monoxide from a faulty boiler poisoned them in their sleep. Their father and his partner almost died. Today was reported that Thomas Cook had received £3.5 million from the hotel company, to compensate it for court costs and commercial damages following the deaths. That is far more than the parents received. The compensation is not unusual, but, say observers, that does not help Thomas Cook. It is perfectly normal for a company that has suffered a financial loss, to claim that back from another company that they feel is responsible for it. In this particular case, though, you have two parents who have lost their children and you have a company, Thomas Cook, which has stopped well short of issuing a complete apology, until now. Therefore, I’m afraid, its reputation looks tarnished. Today the parents issued a statement, in which they expressed anger that they hadn’t had a so-called letter of apology that Thomas Cook says it has sent. The letter has been shown to journalists. They added the firm has not apologised that their safety management systems failed, and they told the Mail on Sunday ""It seems our children’s lives are worth only a fraction of Thomas Cook’s reputation. Thomas Cook is at pains to point out how saddened it is at the deaths of the children. It says the health and safety of its customers is paramount, but the firm also says it was within its rights to seek compensation for the cost of the Greek court case. I understand that right now the firm is involved in crisis talks, as it seeks to deal with the fallout from this terrible story. Christi and Bobby would by now be in their mid-teens, but almost a decade on from their deaths there is still no European law requiring the fitting of carbon monoxide detectors. Something so simple, and yet which could have saved their lives. More schools in England are to be taken out of local council control and given new leadership as academies, under powers to be outlined in the Queen’s Speech. The Education Secretary, Nicky Morgan, said the Government would intervene if pupils were not making satisfactory progress. Where it is clear a school does not have the power to get themselves out of required improvement or helping their students to fulfil their potential, then yes, we will intervene, we will put in support. There are national leaders of education. Of course we will look at the academy model too. Our education editor, Branwenjeffreys, is here with me. This is a significant extension of the Government’s powers to intervene directly in a school run by a local council, notjust when it is failing, but when it has been under performing, less than good, for some time, being offered first of all, support. . It is clear if a school does not improve it will be forced to become an academy. Head teachers point out many of these schools are in more deprived areas where it is hard to recruit good teachers to work and pretty hard too to get good results thasmt are not convinced that becoming an academy is the only solution to making a school more successful and there’s one more thing which makes this quite radical, academies are very similar to free schools. We will get 500 more of those over this Parliament. So taken together, we will see a lot more schools being moved out of the control of local councils. Thank you very much. Zimbabwe is asking for direct aid from Western governments as its population faces more food shortages following a poor harvest. The country’s economy is also being hit as people leave to find work One and a half million Zimbabweans are now believed to be in South Africa alone. Stephen Sackur has been granted rare access to Zimbabwe, as the country thinks about its future and its leader after President Mugabe. A collectiontion of shanty shacks on the edge of Harare. This is the Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe does not want the outside world to see. Here, daily life is a struggle for survival. Many of the young adults are missing. They have fled Zimbabwe’s broken economy. You can see how difficult the jobs are they are doing and to make ends meet, it is very difficult. Is it easy to find a job around here? No. You cannot say it is easy to find a job. I want to thank you for voting for me once again. President Mugabe mug has ruled Zimbabwe for 35 years. He recently turned 91. His Government is again pleading for international aid to stave off economic disaster, but still he dominates his nation. Zimbabwe’s rulers remain defiant. I was granted a rare interview with one of the President’s most controversial Lieutenants. The controversial Lieutena nts. The British controversial Lieutenants. The British Government and its allies impose sanctions seeking to damage the economy in the hope of causing mass disaffection against the Government. They wanted a failed state in Zimbabwe. As we see it todayit state in Zimbabwe. As we see it today it is not a failed state. They wanted the President to fail. The President is not a failed leader. It is an economically failed state? You have been 21+ hours. Which is the problem with people like you. The evidence of economic misery is not hard to find. Unemployment is 80 %. Many eke out a living selling whatever they can on the streets T country’s currency has been abandoned. The only money people trust is the US dollar. At the bus station they pile on to buses, heading for South Africa. And the hope of something better. Why are you going? To look for a job. What kind ofjob do you want? Any. My generation cannot feed our family. We cannot do anything. Does it make you a little bit angry? Very, very angry that we can do nothing. Robert Mugabe cannot rule forever. Will a succession bring change? After bitter infighting in the ruling party this man, known as the crocodile for his ruthless record as a military chief, seems to be the heir apparent. record as a military chief, seems to be the heirapparent. Are be the heir apparent. Are you confident that the transition when it comes will be peaceful and stable? Look, it’s not like a monarchy like you. Getting into power here is not by inheritance, it is by election. It is by the people. It power in this country is acquired through a democratic election. Another bus heads to South Africa. Zimbabwe has been haemorrhaging people and confidence for years. Turning that around, when the Mugabe era ends, will be no easy task. Stephen Sackur, BBC News.

Three people have been arrested after fighting broke out in King’s Cross between dozens of men thought to be football fans. One eyewitness has told BBC London he’s never seen anything like it. There are still traces left of what happened here yesterday evening. In a backstreet behind King’s Cross station, this was no ordinary pub punch-up. The landlord says he saw 20 men aged about 30 charging down this street and when they got the pub one of them, unprovoked, punched a drinker in the face in front of his two small children. And then the violence started. For at least ten minutes glasses and bottles were used as weapons. Pub managed to get some customers to safety indoors but one man is in hospital with head injuries and three people are being questioned by police, all on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. The pub is commonly seen as a stop off point for football supporters on their way to get a train but there has been little explanation for what caused the violence. The first time I’ve seen it. Huge. Train loads of people having a drink after the match but never any fights. The pub captured most of what happened on CCTV which is now with the police, who will have to look within and outside of London to find those responsible.

The winner will be announced in September, as our political editor reports. The process of finding Labour’s next candidate for City Hall has started. There are not enough homes. There are too many Londoners who don’t have somewhere to come home to. I want to do something about that. I would apply a kind of Olympic-type discipline to achieving that. In a field so far containing four MPs, Diane Abbott is the most senior and with the highest profile. Whatvy that the others don’t, is I am known to be a genuinely independent character. We know that Londoners, whether they vote Tory or Labour, want someone who is a genuine independent, not a party. want someone who is a genuine independent, nota party.

We need to make sure it is used to tackle the problems. We have the highest rents and our transport system needs significant investment. The first non-politician is a journalist who knows his transport. I want to make London more affordable and sustainable.

On this afternoon’s BBC London. Police warnings over fake make-up containing poison and urine. And. If you think you’re good with a tablet, wait till you see a six year-old from Croydon who’s a real computer whizz. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. A nurse has been found guilty of murdering two patients and poisoning others - by deliberately tampering with their medical products at Stepping Hill Hospital, in Stockport. A jury at Manchester Crown Court heard that Victorino Chua, who’s A9, had contaminated saline bags and drips using insulin during the summer of 2011. Our Correspondent, Ed Thomas is at Manchester Crown Court. Ed. Victorino Chua told the BBC that patients loved him, he said one patient even wanted to marry him. The truth was that he was a bitter and angry man working inside a hospital poisoning and murdering his patients. He’s the nurse who murdered his patients. Victorino Chua, the Stepping Hill poisoner. In the summer of 2011 he began a poisoning spree, within days he had killed Tracey Arden, photographer Arnold Lancaster and Tracey Arden, photographer Arnold Lancaster and Derek Weaver. Many more were given say lines spiked with insulin. It is the realisation she must have felt. Linda McDonagh was one of the 21 victims, she died just weeks after he was caught. At the end she had, she had a lovely message to say stick together. Enjoy your life. Make the most of it. Mr Chua allow the BBC to film him in Stockport, off-camera he told me patients loved him, one he said even wanted to marry him. The truth was that the nurse was out of control, causing pain. Victorino Chua took out his anger and frustration on the people who needed him the most. His own patients. Quietly, unnoticed, he poisoned them, in full view of his colleagues. He watched them suffer. This was Mr Chua filmed on CCTV inside Stepping Hill, a nurse pretending to care while trying to kill. Whenever he was challenged by other members of staff who looked at his standard of nursing and said you cannot do that, it is not right, thatis cannot do that, it is not right, that is when he becomes angry, that is when he takes it out on the patients. He refused to tell the police why his patients were dying. You knew he was in distress? No comment. Detectives found this at his home, a letter called the bitter nurse confession. He wrote I am a nice person but there is a devil in me, inside mel nice person but there is a devil in me, inside me I can feelthe nice person but there is a devil in me, inside me I can feel the anger at any time which will explode if I am pushed, they will be sorry. This lady was poisoned by Victorino Chua, a survivor, but still terrified. I would say I have lost faith in the NHS, it is a nightmare, because inside hospital you think you are safe and I did not think to ask questions. Fouryears safe and I did not think to ask questions. Four years after the murders, cameras continue to watch over Stepping Hill. A hospital and lives changed forever, or because of the cruelty of Victorino Chua. This is the end of a four-year investigation for the police. The senior officer said it was like a jigsaw with a million pieces, the search for the truth to find the Stepping Hill poisoner. We’ve had reaction from the hospital, it has apologised for distress caused to patients that Victorino Chua. The l+9-year-old nurse will be back here tomorrow to be sentenced for poisoning and murdering his patients. Well, let’s speak to our health editor Hugh Pym. One of the issues to come out of this is the number of foreign nurses in this country, without qualifications and how many more people like this could there be out there? It is not entirely clear whether Victorino Chua had the right qualifications. The police have their suspicions he could have provided fake documentations. The system when he arrived in the UK in 2002 was more lax than it is now. If you come from outside the European Union you just needed a photocopy of a certificate showing you qualified. It was followed up by a call to a regulator. Since then the main regulator, the Nursing and Midwifery Council has tightened it up. Now you have to do an online exam in your country of origin if you come outside the European Union. When you arrive in the UK you have to do another test. They say it is more robust. Between 2012-13 for a short period of a suspended if you like all authentication of nurses coming from outside the EU. They looked back at a number of cases of Filipino nurses coming in deciding they were in order. They have conceded with other countries they have only done a sample so it is possible that some people may have slipped through the net. Thank you forjoining us. Britain’s biggest union, Unite, will debate severing its historic link with the Labour Party at its conference in july. Unite general secretary Len McCluskey has also suggested ending financial support for Labour - depending on the result of the party’s leadership election. But Labour’s acting leader, Harriet Harman, said the party’s leader would not be chosen by the unions. She said new rules would ensure ""the choice of the Labour Party"" wins. Our political correspondent Robin Brant reports. APPLAUSE She is the interim leader of a party in crisis. Still though some applaud Harriet Harman. Almost two weeks has passed and she says Labour is very raw and upset. We lost and we lost badly, there is no getting away from that and it came as a shock. We thought we had a fighting chance of forming the next government. And the ten o’clock exit poll was a body blow, none of us will ever forget. Herjob is to try to keep the party together as it works out what went wrong. She has got to steer it through to September when a new leader is chosen, the plan is to open up the process. As we conduct this debate and elect a leader and deputy leader we must have the public in the forefront of our mind. We must let the public in. Into our mind and the process as we make the decisions about our next leader and how we go forward. It means you could have a say in choosing from this lot, under the could have a say in choosing from this lot, underthe plan this lot, under the plan any member of the public could vote for four of these five who want to be the next leader. You will have to pay a small fee of £3 first. We are seeing an attempt to open up the Labour Party as it tries to recover from the disastrous electoral defeat. But at the party ‘s roots are the trade unions and they look reluctant to lose their influence. For the last few decades they held huge control with block votes and more influence than party members or MPs. Last year Ed Miliband change the way the lead is chosen, there was a special conference and they backed one member, one vote. But can Labour move away from being dependent on the unions? The Tories have plenty of money coming through business connections, tens of millions to rely on. The Labour Party has party members and affiliate and a handful of what you could call wealthy supporters. It is the People’s party. The figures paint a different picture, yes, affiliations from unions and other groups make up the biggest chunk. Members fees are 17%, but donors are not just a handful, they account for 16% of party money. Labour has a long way to go since he resigned last week, as it begins the process of choosing a new leader the country ‘s biggest trade union is considering a divorce. That threat from Unite is probablyjust that, the unions are asserting control as others in the party try to restrict it. Norman Smith is in Westminster. How serious of a rift is this? One of Labour’s key policy thinkers, jon Cruddas, says that Labour needs to go to the dark places. What he means, is to reinvent itself in must think the unthinkable and ask questions it has not dead to ask before. One of those centres on the ties with the trade unions that that it has not dared to ask. Frankly, the unions gave birth to the Labour Party, building it up over decades, they are critical still to the organisation and funding. But this question may now longer -- no longer be avoided. We have heard from Len McCluskey saying there is no question of ending an affiliation with the Labour Party but among grassroots members there could be a movement to change things. There could be a rethink. Particularly in Scotland where many union members support the SNP, questions are asked about why maintain the link with the Labour Party? The key question is this: Will any of Labour’s for declared leadership contenders dare to take part in the debate -- four leadership contenders. In his first major speech since the election, the Prime Minister has renewed his vow to boost NHS funding and create a ""seven-day"" health service. David Cameron said he would commit to a pre-election pledge to increase budgets by at least £8bn a year by 2020, recruit 5,000 new GPs, and guarantee faster access to new drugs and treatments. But doctors’ representatives are sceptical- saying without detail the announcement was ""empty headline-grabbing"". This report from our Health Correspondent Sophie Hutchinson. Extending NHS opening hours with evening and weekend appointments has been the aim of governments for around a decade. Most agree it is essential but the big question is how to achieve it. Today at a GP surgery in Birmingham the Prime Minister promised he would make it happen. There is nothing that embodies the spirit of one nation coming together, nothing that working people depend on more than the NHS. Our commitment to free health care for everybody wherever you are and when you need it. What might a seven day a week NHS look like, this is a Sunday afternoon at a GP surgery. This practice is linking up with 30 others to offer week end and evening appointments. From our experience it has been a resounding success, the patients are happy and it has eased the load for the GP work during the week. By next year the government says 18 million patients will have access to GPs running seven day week services and everybody will have that by 2020. It is promising an extra 5000 GPs to staff the new system and in hospitals at once to tackle the problem of death rates, 16% higher for patients admitted on Sundays. Nurses leaders are questioning whether the government ‘s plan is affordable. It needs to be properly funded because this is a paradigms shift in the way in which the NHS works. It is notjust about a few doctors working extra. It is a whole workforce change and it can only be achieved properly if it is properly funded. The government says it has put aside an extra £8 billion by 2020 to fund extended hours that doctors leaders insist the money is the bare minimum needed to pay for the current range of services. Plans to destroy boats used by people-smugglers operating in Libya are expected to be approved at a meeting of European Union ministers in Brussels. Britain is leading efforts to get the United Nations Security Council to back the mission - which is part of the EU’s response to the migrant crisis in the Mediterranean. Our Europe correspondent Chris Morris is in Brussels. We should probably make one thing clear from the outset, the European Union is not planning to invade Libya, there will be no conventional boots on the ground, ministers insist. If they want to reduce the power and influence of the smuggling gangs, they cannot do that from the middle of the Mediterranean, so they really do need the ability to operate right up to the Libyan coast. Scenes that have become all-too-familiar, migrants packed dangerously on two small boats trying to reach Europe, more than 1800 people have already drowned in Mediterranean this year. Now, the European Union is pressing ahead with plans for a military mission, primarily a naval one, to take on the gangs who charge a fortune to traffic people across the sea. EU foreign and defence ministers are meeting in Brussels, they are expected to agree to set up the mission with a headquarters in Italy, and contributions from key countries like Britain and France. The aim is to disrupt the business model, that makes people smuggling such a lucrative trade. The Royal Navy is already saving lives at sea but we have got to agree action to get rid of the criminal gangs and disrupt trafficking networks, that means gathering much more intelligence on how these networks are organised and doing more to help the countries where the migrants come from. The first phase, involving gathering Taligent is an the activities of people trafficking gangs, and then action will be taken to destroy smugglers boats, operating in international waters. -- gathering intelligence. The most controversial phase will be military incursions into Libyan territorial waters and on the coast itself. That will require a UN Security Council resolution to give the move legal backing, and Britain is leading efforts to get one, it could take some time. Libya is the kilo occasion because at the moment, that is where the majority of migrants heading for Europe take to the seas. From a shoreline dominated by a potentially hostile Islamist militia. -- potentially hostile Islamist militia. -- Libya is the key location. If they want to take on the traffickers, despite misgivings they need to take some action themselves. There is no start date yet agreed that the mission and it is full of risk, but most EU countries agree that doing nothing is no longer an option. That means there will be plenty of detail discussion on legal issues and about the exact military posture of this new mission, special forces will be involved probably, that is not the kind of thing that gets publicised in advance, this is the EU operating a little outside of its comfort zone, plenty of challenges ahead.

There’s more pressure on the Iraqi government after it was forced to ask Shia militias backed by Iran to help retake the capital of Anbar province, Ramadi, after it fell to the militant group, Islamic State. Iraqi forces abandoned their positions yesterday after days of heavy fighting. Our middle east correspondent jim Muir reports. The final push by the IS militants moving into streets and quarters of a city that has been a battle ground for months. Outgunned and without reinforcements, the Iraqi army finally had no choice but to flee while it could, abandoning even the command headquarters for the entire province. Tens of thousands of terrified civilians also fled the city since the battle began. TRANSLATION: There is chaos and violence everywhere, it is terrifying, shells and bombs have destroyed many houses. We have heard a lot of families have been killed. The flight of both army and people leaves the militants in control of a ghost city, another provincial capital has been added to their list of assets. Ramadi isjust 60 miles from Baghdad, though IS already controlled towns even closer to the capital. It has taken over large parts of the region, from the Turkish border in the north, through Syria, and across northern Iraq. These are basically sunny areas, with grievances, which IS has exploited.

An engineer from the Royal Navy has gone absent without leave after publishing claims that Britain’s nuclear submarine programme is, in his words, a disaster waiting to happen. Able Seaman William McNeilly released a report on the whistleblower website, Wikilea ks. The Royal Navy said it ""completely disagreed"" with his views. Our defence correspondent jonathan Beale is with me. What has he been saying? This document is 18 pages long, some of it is rambling, but there are allegations, some mundane, about food hygiene, but serious issues raised as well, for example about technical faults on board the submarine is that carry the nuclear deterrent, but, fires, the biggest concern, that he was able to photograph a top-secret document and he was also claiming that getting into Fars Lane, where a the submarines are based, was easier than getting into some nightclubs. Serious issues raised, the Royal Navy says that these are observations by a veryjunior Seaman. They say that the nuclear submarines are safe and also that this document in itself does not compromise national security. -- Faslane. I have heard from him commonly send an e-mail, he says that he is abroad, he says that he will come back and will hand himself to police commonly says that music baiting to go to prison. The Royal Navy say their first concern is his welfare. As per the motivation to do this, in the e-mail to me he said he wanted to show the world that peace can no longer be maintained by nuclear weapons. There does seem to be an ideological purpose behind him releasing this information. Thank you very much. Police in the US State of Texas say nine people have been killed and at least 200 arrested after a shootout between rival biker gangs in Waco. Eye witnesses say the scene was like a war zone. It happened at the Twin Peaks Sports Bar and Grill in a shopping centre. Diners and staff at the cafe locked themselves in a freezer room for safety. Our correspondent Alistair Leithead sent this report. The cameras CBITIEFBS WEFE distance, in the aftermath of a biker gang battle in the car park of a sports bar in Waco, Texas. Hundreds of bikers from up to five different gangs had met at noon, to settle their differences. What began as a fist fight soon turned to knives,, and ultimately, guns. -- knives, chains, clubs. We were fortunate to have our best well-trained officers here, that was the tactical unit. They were here for the specific reason, we knew that there was going to be trouble at this biker event. Some of those eating at the restaurant suddenly found themselves caught up in a gunfight. My son is in there, my husband is in there, these bandito Gang husband is in there, these bandito gang members think they can do whatever they want people. They began shooting people. Nobody was doing anything and they began shooting people. More than a dozen people were injured in the fight, police say it may have been sparked by a turf battle over a parking space. It was a very gruesome, violent scene, you could tell there were numerous rounds exchanged. I saw everything from pistol casings to rifle casings. I saw knives and a club, bubble be one of the most violent gruesome crime scenes I have seenin violent gruesome crime scenes I have seen in 35 years. All of those killed or injured were gang members, police warned people to stay away from the area, amid fears they could be further clashes between rival bikers. The Queen and Prince Harry have been visiting Chelsea Flower Show where Prince Harry has a garden promoting his charity. The Sentebale Garden is designed to draw attention to the work of helping children in Lesotho. Our royal correspondent Daniela Relph is there. This is based on the work of Prince Harry’s charity in South Africa, and he has been here to see this little bit of Africa which has been created in Chelsea. With the garden’s designer, Matt Keighley, to show them around, Prince Harry got his first view of the Sentebale Garden, he had seen the designs and talk through the ideas, but he had not actually seen the finished garden until this morning. It is fantastic, everything that I could have wished for. I think that from the first stage we sat down around the table all of those months ago, one year ago, whenever it was. Best part of a year. All of the sketches, well this is howl part of a year. All of the sketches, well this is how I imagined it. I think that Matt is over the moon, the way it has come out. It is kind of perfect, if my garden were big enough, I would try to move it into mY enough, I would try to move it into my garden! It celebrates the opening of a children’s centre in Lesotho, there are footprints, flowers, water features, all of them are designed to give a flavour of South Africa. The priority now for Prince Harry is meeting his knees, Princess Charlotte, and on life after leaving the Army next month. It has not yet sunk in, it will seek sink in inevitably. We will do one thing at a time. The concentration at the moment is on the garden, try to raise as much awareness as possible of Sentebale Garden. It has been a very soggy start at Chelsea, good for some gardens, maybe, very soggy start at Chelsea, good forsome gardens, maybe, not for some gardens, maybe, not so good the visitors. 550 exhibitors are taking part, from the eccentric and creative displays, to something a little more low-key.

He’s facing four charges, all relating to one girl who was 15 at the time of the alleged offences, three of those charges were for sexual activity with a girl under the age of 16 and one charge of grooming. His solicitor, Paul Morris, indicated thatjohnson will fight the charges against him. He has been bailed to appear at Durham Crown Court on the 3rd ofjune. It means he’s available to play for Sunderland, they have a match on Wednesday against Arsenal at the Emirates. It is there that they will hope to get the point they need to secure safety ahead of the final round of matches this weekend. Manchester United manager Louis Van Gaal has admitted he is unsure whether his goalkeeper David De Gea will stay at the club beyond the end of the season. The Spain international has one year left on his contract but with 10-time European Cup winners Real Madrid interested, Old Trafford could have seen the last of De Gea. Tim Hague has more. It isa It is a shirt he’s very much made his own, David de Gea, but is his number pad Manchester United? He has to choose and it is not so easy. To choose between two big clubs. We would be very happy when he says. You believe he will? You never know. Yesterday against Arsenal, they drew 1-1, but the Spaniard went off with a hamstring injury in what could be perhaps his last appearance at Old Trafford. Real Madrid are a club after all few can resist, even more so when you are from Madrid. He is Spanish, his girlfriend is Spanish, his father and mother, every week, every two weeks here. To watch. It is difficult for him. It is a big compliment for matches to United. The 24-year-old, who is expected to win the Player of the Season award for United looks like he will be needed at Real Madrid. Yesterday they lost the Spanish title to Barcelona and their goalkeeper had a moment to forget. All the signs suggest he is on his way but don’t discount the power of playing for Manchester United just yet. Rugby Union now and Harlequins have signed Wales centre jamie Roberts from French side Racing Metro. Roberts has won 69 caps for his country and has also represented the British & Irish Lions. Director of Rugby Conor O’Shea says he’ll be ""a role model"" to the club’s players. Roberts, who holds a medical doctorate, will also study at Cambridge University and is likely to play in the Varsity Match against rivals Oxford. Rory Mcllroy has won his 11th PGA Tour title, by claiming the Wells Fargo Championship by a massive 7 shots in North Carolina. Afteran 11 under par 61 on Saturday, Sunday was more sedate by his high standards but it was still sprinkled by moments of magic, like that approach on the 12th. The World Number One finished on 21 under par, a tournament record, so he’s in great shape ahead of next month’s US Open. ~ I was probably playing a little bit better last summer I guess. Ifiled like everything was really on, I putted well and I was chipping well -- Ifelt like. Istill feel there are areas I can sharpen up going into the US open. It is very close. That’s all sport for now. There have been thousands of reported cases of sexual abuse against people in England with disabilities, according to figures obtained by the BBC. A Freedom of Information request to councils found there have been nearly 5,000 reports of sexual abuse of adults with disabilities over the past two years and charities say the issue is vastly under-reported. Victoria Derbyshire has this special report which, to protect the identities of those involved, is told using animation. The first I heard about it, I got a phone call from a friend saying she took a phone off her daughter, and there was some images on it. I went around. Seeing these explicit photos. janet as we are calling her discovered her 15-year-old daughter, Charlotte, who had Asperger’s syndrome, had been groomed into sending explicit videos and photos to a man posing as a girl her own age. When she refused to send more images he threatened to send them to her family images he threatened to send them to herfamily and her family and friends. It was two weeks later, some of my friends said there was a fake account in my name. I searched my name, and this page would come up and it had the pictures on there. I was getting called names. We had to move house. I had to start at a new school. It was starting a new life really. One organisation aiming to help people like Charlotte is Beverly Lewis house, we gained rare access inside the refuge. This is the only refuge of its kind in the UK and this refuge is specifically for women with learning disabilities and physical disabilities who been the victim of sexual to or assault. Grooming and also financial fraud. Some of the women who stay here have had a lifetime of abuse. Maybe they have been in care. They have been victims of abuse. Also in families. A number of the women have been exploited by their boyfriends and forced into prostitution. A Freedom of information request to 152 councils in England found that there have been nearly 5000 reports of sexual abuse against adults with disabilities over the last two years. Extra 2% of those reports related to those with learning disabilities -- 63%. It is concerning figure, unfortunately we think it is the visible peak of a large the problem. Because we know with sexual abuse that many children and young people and victims find it difficult to speak out anyway. Charlotte ‘s mother agrees more needs to be done. People with disabilities, Ido not think there is much out there, I have not heard much about it. If she goes out, I take are in the car to where ever, andl take are in the car to where ever, and I pick her up afterwards. Sad that I take her out. The Victoria Derbyshire programme reporting there. Now, it is time for the weather. It is a bit of a journey this week, we started miserable on Monday morning, thick cloud with rain. This scene typical. Over the next few days we will have sunshine and some beautiful skies with images like this, heavy showers and thunderstorms in the F. At a bit of sunshine, too. -- in the air. By the end of the week things will calm down as we go towards the bank holiday, drierand down as we go towards the bank holiday, drier and brighter. holiday, drierand brighter. Before we get there we need to get rid of this rain. This bright band you can see on the radar, vicious thunderstorms across South Wales going through the Midlands towards East Anglia. Brilliant tense rain. More showers following behind. -- really intense rain. Parts of the UK could see Sunny spells this afternoon and it should be a fine end to the day across the Midlands. Some showers going across East Anglia this afternoon. More showers over the West of England and Northern Ireland. Thunderstorms possible here as with Scotland. More persistent over Aberdeenshire. These showers do not stop there, they keep coming overnight continuing to get blown across all areas on a brisk wind. The wind is lighter through central Scotland, here we could get close to freezing. Most towns and cities staying above but it is chilly enough tomorrow. Tomorrow is another day of sunshine and showers but notjust simple rain showers, we will have big beasts with hail and thunder. Some sunshine between showers. After some sunshine, the next shower will follow behind. CooL next shower will follow behind. Cool, 11-12. We might get into the teens in central London but it won’t be pretty at Chelsea with the likelihood of heavy showers. It will calm down, some showers on Wednesday but drier and brighter on Thursday. This is the general theme across the UK, not as many showers on Wednesday, more sunshine and the wind is lighter. Temperatures are bit higher. As the showers fade on Wednesday, we start to see some high pressure moving in from the south-west. Calming things down. There is a weather front in north-west Scotland and there will be rain on Thursday but elsewhere, fine pressure promising fine conditions into the bank holiday weekend. Thank you very much.

Rats droppings, urine and toxic chemicals are just some of the substances found in fake beauty products by City of London police.

Tara Welsh has been speaking to an officer about how dangerous the products can be. In Perkins we have found human your ring and cyanide, these are luxury brand perfumes -- in perfumes. Even the counterfeit products are quite expensive to buy but you don’t get what you think you are getting. With the make-up you have other things, mercury, lead. With suncream, it is not so much in them, it is what is out of them, they don’t have UV protection. You think you have got something cheaper and you put it on your body, maybe your children, and they are not protecting you. Tell me how big a problem this is? It is widespread, which is why we are not naming any luxury brand product. If you think you are getting a bit cheaper and it looks too good to be true it probably is.

And the pub chain fined thousands of pounds for discriminating against travellers. largest companies pay staff a living wage. Good evening. A nurse has been found guilty of murdering two patients and poisoning twenty others at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport. A jury at Manchester Crown Court heard that Victorino Chua had contaminated saline bags and drips using insulin - while working on two acute wards in 2011. Stockport NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the Hospital, said it was unimaginable that any nurse would want to harm their patients, and has described the crimes as ""utterly shocking"". Our correspondent, Ed Thomas, is inside the hospital. This is the place where Victorino Chua worked. He had a duty to care. On these corridors, inside these walls, he could not care less about how much pain he caused. He is the nurse who wanted to kill. No comment. Victorino Chua, the Stepping Hill poisoner. For the first time we hear from the grieving families and the patients who survived. In the summer of 2011, he began a poisoning spree, he murdered Tracy Arden, a mother with two children, and 83-year-old widower, Derek Weaver, many more were given saline spiked with insulin. Amanda and Rebecca’s mother was poisoned at random by Victorino Chua. She survived but died just weeks after he was caught. That realisation of what she must have felt. Leaving us. Even at the end she had a lovely message to just say, you know, us. Even at the end she had a lovely message tojust say, you know, stick together and enjoy your life, make the most of it. Victorino Chua allowed us to film him in Stockport. Off-camera he told me the claims were lies. His patients loved him. One woman, he said, even wanted to marry him. The truth was revealed in his own words in this letter found hidden in his home. He called it the bitter nurse confession. He wrote that he was a nice person but there is a devil inside Victorino Chua took out his anger and frustration on the people who needed him most, his own patients. Quietly, unnoticed, he poisoned them. And in full view of his colleagues watched them suffer. How did you not notice in moaning and groaning... This was him after his arrest. Is that because you knew he was in distress, because you poisoned him? No comment. Refusing to explain why his patients were dying. Whenever he has been challenged by other members of staff he has always said -- challenged by other members of staff he has always said -- whenever he has been challenged by other members of staff, when they have said that you cannot do that, he would get angry. This is him filmed on CCTV inside Stepping Hill Hospital, a nurse pretending to care while trying to kill. I didn’t think I would make it. She is a survivor but still terrified. I have lost faith in the NHS. It is a nightmare. When you are in hospital you think you are safe. I did not think that ask questions, you do as you are told. The BBC is given special access inside Stepping Hill Hospital. Nurses now work in pairs. They check each other’s work while the cameras check them. Where staff and patients are watched over like never before. I feel really angry, actually. Angry that a nurse could do this to patients. I know this organisation is full of fantastic, caring, compassionate nurses. He chose to use his qualification to do harm. It has taken four years to get to the truth, to find Victorino Chua, the nurse who did not care if his patients lived or died. We are told by the hospital that these cameras are not going anywhere. Neitherare these cameras are not going anywhere. Neither are the security teams that patrol the corridors. An unwanted legacy of Victorino Chua, the nurse who will be sentenced tomorrow for murdering and poisoning his own patients. Thank you very much. Greater Manchester Police say the investigation which led to Chua’s arrest and conviction was one of the the biggest and most complex it’s ever carried out. Officers flew to Chua’s native Philippines, where their investigations cast serious doubt over his medical qualifications. Our Health Correspondent Sophie Hutchinson reports. Is this certificate real, and is this photo actually Victorino Chua? When British detectives arrived in the Philippines these were their concerns. On the streets there is clear evidence of an illicit trade in fake documents as the BBC discovered. Around 35 people asking for a certificate. For a diploma, you can buy that. It costs about £20. Police suspect that he used fake nursing documents. This now ominous photo suggests he may have enrolled to study nursing, but did he complete the qualification? The BBC tracked down the former registrar of a local medical college. Who confirmed he has been a student, but could not say whether the final paperwork had been falsified. I can remember that he requested for United Kingdom. I don’t know if there were some changes made by somebody else. Since Victorino Chua came to work in the UK, checks on foreign nurses have become far stricter. But before 2005, all that was needed was a photocopy of a certificate and confirmation from a foreign regulator the applicant was a registered nurse. The man who oversaw the investigation says serious questions need to be asked. Nobody wants to question the nursing industry, they are fantastic at what they do. But if there are people who are not nurses, people who are not qualified to be nurses, or people who have been disciplined in their Mac and culture, we need to question this. Checks have been made on all Filipino nurses who arrived before 2005, and some nurses from Australia, India, and Pakistan. Some unqualified staff could still be working in our hospitals, however. -- in their own country. We cannot rule it out. You would suspect that if somebody was not a nurse it would be detected. Many questions remain unanswered. Did he train as a nurse, did he use forged documents, and why did he come to kill in the UK? Viewers in the north-west of England can see more on that story after this programme. The Prime Minister says Britain must become the first country in the world to have a ""truly seven-day a week National Health Service."" In his first major speech since the Conservatives won the election, David Cameron said that by 2020 he wanted everyone in England to have access to a GP in the evenings and at weekends. But doctors’ representatives said without detail the announcement was ""empty headline-grabbing. "" Here’s our Health Editor Hugh Pym. Good afternoon. The new face of general practice, a call centre covering 70,000 people in Birmingham connects patients with a GP, or gets them in on the day appointment at their surgery. And it was here David Cameron came to flesh out his plan for a seven-day week NHS in England. It is a new deal for GPs, with for a seven-day week NHS in England. It is a new dealfor GPs, with new investment... He wants hospitals and surgeries to provide more services at weekends, but how will that be achieved? GP practices are already saying there are major recruitment problems, where are you going to find the extra doctors to fill this seven-day week access? We have more GPs than when I became Prime Minister. We are training and hiring more people. We have practice nurses at health centres, people who can help with dental problems, physios who can help with that kind of problem, you are going to find far better services there than in your GP practice. Patients here like Carol appreciate the way the service works. My doctor, as iPhone him, he will tell me to come down in an hour, or can you make it in half an hour? -- hour, or can you make it in half an hour? --I hour, or can you make it in half an hour? -- I phoned him. I’m seen immediately, I’m not hanging about. Some questioned whether all GPs were ready for change. I think it will be difficult to implement. It means longer hours for those working in the GP practices. The old GP practice, it was difficult to get through, but the new one is so much easier to access. One GP in North London said the Prime Minister was making unrealistic promises. It is UP making unrealistic promises. It is up to two weeks in many practices to see a GP. What we need to do is get the basics right, and not be making promises that, in fact, do not bear any reality. NHS chiefs in England have suggested that a minimum of £8 billion will be needed above inflation in the year 2020 from Government on top of the extremely ambitious efficiency savings just maintain the same sort of level of care as now. Offering a broader range of services on top of that will be far from easy. David Cameron says he will find the £8 billion, but health chiefs say more will be needed to give patients all of the services which have been promised. EU defence and foreign ministers have approved plans to destroy boats used by people-smugglers operating in Libya, where there’s a civil war. It’s part of an international response to tackle the increasing numbers of illegal migrants from Africa and the Middle East crossing the Mediterranean Sea to reach Europe. More than 1,800 migrants have died in the Mediterranean so far this year. Iranian backed Shia militias have combined forces with the Iraqi army in the fight against extremists from so-called Islamic State, who’ve seized the Iraqi city of Ramadi. The provincial capital was overrun in the biggest gain for IS since last summer. The Iraqi government hopes the militiamen can help retake the city which is only 70 miles west of Baghdad. Police in Texas say nearly 200 people are to face organised crime charges after a shootout between rival motorbike gangs which left nine people dead. The violence erupted at a restaurant in the city of Waco. As Alistair Leithead reports, at least 18 people were also taken to hospital with bullet and stab wounds. Hundreds of bikers from as many as five different gangs arrived here at noon to settle their differences. Within minutes, a brawl had broken out in the bathrooms. It spilled out into the car park. Fistfight soon turned to knives, clubs, chains, and guns, and that is when the police stepped in. In 31+ years of law enforcement, this is the worst crime scene, the most violent crime scene that I have ever been involved in. We have recovered numerous weapons. We will probably approach nearly 100 weapons that were recovered from individuals at this writer fight, if you will. All of those killed and injured were biker members. But some other people found themselves caught UP other people found themselves caught up in the chaos. -- other people found themselves caught up in the chaos.-- biker other people found themselves caught up in the chaos. -- biker fight.

Police knew that the gangs were meeting there and were on stand-by, but the staff were terrified. I crawled towards the freezers with a lot of waitresses and other people. It was really scary. We didn’t know if somebody was going to come back. People said that people outside had guns, it was really scary. The police in Waco are on high alert, worried that the gangs will come back to settle scores.

And the pipes ring out for a World War I soldier. A BBC TV crew has been arrested and detained in Qatar while on an official visit to report on the conditions of migrant workers building the stadiums and infrastructure for the 2022 World Cup. The team were stopped by security services as they gathered material, interrogated and imprisoned. Among them was the BBC’s Middle East Correspondent Mark Lobel. Here’s his report. Since the tiny Gulf state of Qatar stunned the world by winning the chance to host football’s most dazzling tournament, it’s attracted worldwide attention, but that has come at a price. A focus on the housing and working conditions of low skilled migrant workers. There are no complaints at this brand-new accommodation complex we were shown by the government. A luxury swimming pool, a well-equipped gym. Workers on World Cup projects are the lucky ones. TRANSLATION: Everything is good here, my lifestyle has changed. It’s a better and more hygienic place to live. On the other side of town, and away from our PR minders, we joined a bus-load of labourers to see where the majority of migrants live now. Many have been here years and endured the long hours and lack of holiday in order to send money back home. We had heard conditions were a far cry from what we had seen earlier. What we didn’t know was that we were being followed by the State security service. Our arrest was dramatic. Eight cars drove us off the road as we left the centre of Doha. The cameraman, translator and I were treated like spies and interrogated separately by security officers. Our camera and footage were seized. In handcuffs, we were hauled in front of a prosecutor. He accused us of disrespecting Qatar, and threatened us with a spell behind bars to teach us a lesson. After two nights in a filthy prison, just as suddenly as we were arrested, they let us go. Fifa say they are investigating what happened to us. They say any restriction to press freedom will be looked into with the seriousness it deserves. The BBC and foreign media have uncovered horrible living conditions here before. It has become a constant irritation for the government. Hours after leaving prison, I met the Labour minister who had invited us to the country. I asked him whether the security services were being overly paranoid. I am more paranoid than they are. I am facing it day in and day out, morning and evening. Sometimes I wake up at night, open up one of the national TV channels, and there they are executing workers in the street. The figures we have, whatever small it is, it is too much. But it is, by far, less than what has been reported in the international press. As Qatar’s World Cup approaches, the focus on migrant labour is only likely to increase. Unexpectedly, how this country handles the media, is also becoming a concern. Thomas Cook is donating to charity half of the £3 million it received in compensation for lost bookings after two children died while on holiday at a hotel in Corfu. The company has been strongly criticised by the parents of Bobby and Christi Shepherd, who were overcome by carbon monoxide from a faulty boiler. Danny Savage, who covered the inquests into the deaths, is in Central London for us now. This is quite a turnaround from Thomas Cook today. It is. After days of bad headlines, Thomas Cook has tried to write what many people perceive as a wrong. The issue was, after the court case in Greece following the children’s deaths, two Thomas Cook representatives were cleared. The company went after damages and were paid out £3 million, half of the money went to the insurers, the other half has been with the company ever since. Thomas Cook say today they were donating the money to the children’s charity Unicef in an effort to put down some of the criticism that has been aimed at it over the last few days. One other significant development today, during the inquest Thomas Cook executives would not apologise to the family of the children about what happened in Corfu, but that changed today. They say they felt very sorry for them during the inquest, but today the Chief Executive of Thomas Cook has said he apologises to the family for all they have gone through. There has now been an apology from Thomas Cook to the parents of Bobby and Christi Shepherd. Those parents are yet to respond today. They are still thinking about today’s developments, but it has been a U-turn by Thomas Cook over this whole affair. The England and Sunderland footballer, Adam johnson, has appeared before magistrates after being charged with sexually assaulting a 15 year old girl, and one offence of grooming. He was released on conditional bail by Peterlee magistrates in County Durham, and will appear at Durham Crown Court next month. Dean Potter, one of America’s best known extreme athletes, has been killed during a stunt in Yosemite National Park in California. The 1+3 year old was renowned for his high-line walks and high-risk parachute jumps, some of which he carried out with his dog. Last year he released a 22-minute long film called When Dogs Fly which chronicled their extreme adventures, and which became a viral sensation. It’s the first day of term for MPs in the House of Commons since the General Election, and the first Parliament to contain a majority of Tory MPs for 18 years. The day came with a number of Commons traditions, as our Deputy Political Editor james Landale reports. It’s a new parliament with old traditions. MPs may be elected by the people, but they can’t start work until the Lords and Ladies in hats and gowns have asked them to elect a speaker. Politely, of course. We are commanded by Her Majesty to let you know that, it not being convenient for her to be present here this day... With the queen busy elsewhere, not everybody paying full attention, MPs wasted no time in heading back to the Commons to choose their speaker. A democratic election withjust one choose their speaker.

First the Prime Minister on Labour’s acting leader. There seems to be a common pattern, a man comes along and makes a terrible mess of it and she comes along to tidy it up. The Right Honourable Lady might wonder why she’s not given the job on a permanent basis. She might not be in charge for long but before she is replaced in the autumn she said Labour had a job to do. I congratulate the Right Honourable member for Whitney on returning to the house. We have a very important job of being the official opposition, and we will be fearless and effective in doing that. With 56 newly I could MPs, the SNP hope that they also provide opposition, revelling in their status as the third party of Parliament. -- revelling in their status as the third party of Parliament. -- newly elected. We still support the fair treatment of the smaller parties, smaller parties like the Liberal Democrats! Parliament is back with more women, more ethnic minorities than before, and also with more Conservatives. Work starts formally next week when the Queen pops round for the state opening. It’s the highlight of the horticultural year and today Prince Harry was one of the first to visit the gardens on display at the Chelsea Flower Show. The prince revealed he has yet to meet his new niece, Princess Charlotte, as he toured a garden designed for his charity. Daniela Relph is there. She is a regular visitor. Every year the Queen comes to Chelsea. This year they will be an element of keeping it in the family. This is one of the central gardens based around Prince Harry’s charity in the Lesotho in South Africa. He is yet to meet his new niece, Prince Princess Charlotte, it’s everything I could have wished for. Perfect. There is always a touch of glamour at Chelsea. 550 exhibitors are taking part, from the eccentric and creative displays, to something a little more low-key, here a garden that reflects Arabic and Islamic culture. The nine-year-old George Hassell, Young School Gardner of the year, there was work to be done. With the help of the florist, Simon, he has been making the bouquet of flowers he will present to the Queen. It’s really exciting. I was at camping when my mum told mel would give a bouquet of flowers to the Queen. I nearly fell in the fire. It’s good to have an explosion of colour in it, like a firework. I have a theory that plans like fireworks, because they come up, then the bud explodes at the top. This was George’s big moment with the Queen. Handing over his bouquet. It included flowers from his own garden at home. George’s first visit here has been a memorable one. Chelsea is now a real mix of the extravagant, and some good old-fashioned gardening. Around 165,000 people are expected to visit the flower show this week. Looked lovely and sunny there, what’s the outlook? Challenging conditions, as there will be for all of us over the next few days. There might be sunshine at times, but some very heavy downpours in a forecast with rumbles of thunder and gusty winds. That win tonight will drive showers in western areas further east. Few spots will remain dry, particularly in central Scotland and not too many showers in the far south-east. Showers keep going elsewhere.

Thunder can’t be ruled out. Not as bad a start tomorrow, most was they dry on the morning commute. On the drive home showers will become heavy and frequent. Showers across north-west England, permanent showers across Northern Ireland with sunny spells in between. In the south-east, the one area where there will be fewer showers, more dry. If you completely missed the showers as they rattled through in that strong breeze, you will be one of the few. They could become heavy in the afternoon with hail and thunder.

Carmel Bloom died following a routine operation at a private hospital in Essex in 2002. For the past 13 years her family have been trying to discover the circumstances surrounding her death.

Why this dyslexic, former alcoholic, gay businessman thinks he’s got what it takes to be London’s next Tory Mayor. And in London to promote his latest film and An Evening With Al Pacino - we hear from the Holywood A-lister. Welcome to BBC London News with me, Riz Lateef. Carmel Bloom died following a routine operation at a private hospital in Essex in 2002. For the past 13 years her family have been trying to discover the circumstances surrounding her death. Two inquests have already been held - both were quashed - and today an unprecedented third got underway at west London Coroners Court. From there Alpa Patel sent this report. It isa It is a fight that has cost him over £2 million, he says, and over a decade of work. Bernard Bloom and his wife have won a third inquest into his sister’s death, a landmark decision awarded by the High Court. It has taken in-- and emotional toll on the family. It has been very expensive and it has also cost the local authorities money. We want closure, we want local authorities money. We want closure, we wa nt to move local authorities money. We want closure, we want to move on, and I have not grieved for my sister because I have continuously been fighting forjustice. Carmel Bloom, seen here on her wedding day, died in 2002, aftera seen here on her wedding day, died in 2002, after a routine kidney stone operation here at this hospital in Ilford. The first inquest in 2003 found she died of natural causes, but that verdict was quashed a year later. A second inquest in 2005 found a lack of care after surgery played a part in her death, but that finding was also quashed. A third inquest is unprecedented and will hear fresh evidence including, it is believed, this emergency call. Hello. I am at the hospital in Ilford. Init, you can hear a noise describing the seriousness of her condition-- a nurse. She has got oedema and she is coughing up blood and she is very unstable. A recent inspection by the Care Quality Commission found that the hospital met all of the key standards. In a statement, it was said that it was not appropriate for Bupa to comment. A third inquest will finally give her family the answers they have been fighting for. Coming up later in the programme: Eau de Toilette - a warning from police as human urine and rats droppings are discovered in counterfeit perfume and make-up. The budget pub chain Wetherspoons has been ordered to pay tens of thousands of pounds in compensation for racially discriminating against travellers. In a landmark case, a judge said the company was guilty of ""racial stereotyping"" after refusing a group of travellers entry to a pub in Holloway in 2011. Marc Ashdown is outside the pub with more details. Backin Back in 2011, the Irish travellers held an annual conference next door to this barbecue in Holloway. Afterwards, a group of them tried to go for a drink here, as they said they had done for many years. This time, the bouncers told they were not allowed in. They felt this was discrimination, so they took a case to the High Court, and today, a judge agreed with them. The judge said it can be reduced to this crude proposition, whenever Irish travellers and English gypsies go into public houses, violent disorder is inevitable because that is how they behave. He ordered Wetherspoon to pay each of the eight people £3000. After the case today, I spoke to one of them, who says he feels it could be a landmark. There is a general attitude - and thejudge in this case has recognised it is a general attitude out there - that travellers or gypsies mean trouble. This judge has looked at it and he has said that that is a racially ethnic discriminatory attitude and assumption that has no place in 21st-century Britain. What about the company, what has Wetherspoon had to say? They have apologised for any distress and upset caused to the eight people. The chairman said they have always been fully committed to operating their presences at premises in a non-discriminatory way. They did say that ten other claimants failed in their case and all other claims were dismissed for racial harassment and aggravated damages. Staff were found not to have acted in a hostile and aggressive manner. Then there was a matter of cost, which has still to be argued out. The battle could well run to over £1 million on both sides, so it has been an expensive case, but the hope among the travelling community is that this will send a message to owners of PÂP$Â will send a message to owners of pops, bars, and restaurants but if you discriminate, you could face the courts. -- pops. A man who falsely claimed to have been disabled has been fined. He was captured loading boxes, and driving. He will serve 18 months in prison and will pay back £5,000. Meanwhile, more than 70 firefighters have been tackling a blaze An elderly man has died in a fire in Croydon this morning. London Fire Brigade were called to a block of flats on Addiscombe Road at around 10 o’clock. The man was found dead on the ground floor. An investigation is underway into the cause of the fire, but is not believed to be suspicious. Meanwhile, more than 70 firefighters have been tackling a blaze at a warehouse in Greenwich. It happened just after Apm at a food distribution warehouse on Lombard Wall in Charlton. It’s estimated about 10% of the property and six lorries were on fire. Rats’ droppings, human urine and even arsenic are some of the shocking substances found in counterfeit beauty products. The warning comes from City of London police who say it is putting people’s lives at risk and internet shopping has helped fuel a rise in fake products. They’re now urging consumers to be more aware of what they’re buying online. Here’s Tarah Welsh. Would you expect your favourite perfume to be made in a factory like this? Or your best lipstick created in conditions like these? No? Well, gangs are using these filthy laboratories to make fake goods. Then they’re being sold online to unsuspecting Londoners. Well, in perfumes, we have actually found human urine and also cyanide. And these are sort of luxury brand perfumes, perfumes that you probably think most of the time you can trust, and they are expensive to buy, and even the counterfeit products are usually quite expensive to buy, but you certainly don’t get what you think you are getting. It is electrical products too, which look genuine until they blow up. I could hear a funny buzzing sound coming from the straightener. Then all of a sudden a few sparks started to fly out, just come out from where the cable connected with the straightener, so quite close to my face. Then a loud bang and a flame just burst out from the strainer, and that is when Ijust dropped them on the ground and ran to the wall and switched them off at the wall. Thousands of websites promising the sort of products you’d find on the beauty counter have been shut down by police. They have confiscated £3.5 million worth of goods in over the past year and a half. Fake make up accounts for 6% of sales in the beauty sector and costs the UK industry £201 million per year. Also several thousand jobs that are not created. The news is that the UK is actually doing better than the EU average, which has a rate of counterfeit of about 8%. Of course, it is not all about the impact on the industry. Counterfeit goods are often rip-offs of designer brands. When people buy them, they often think they are putting the best stuff on their face or hair, when actually it is quite the opposite. The poisonous chemicals in these goods can be scary, but so can what is missing. Fake sun cream often contains no protection, so some brands may be expensive, but cheap fakes can prove even more costly. And Tarah’s here now. Consumers are constantly being told to be aware of what they’re buying, especialy online. Are fraudsters finding cleverer ways of conning people? The problem is that some of these items look so real, and often the images have been stolen from the genuine websites, so it is really hard for people to tell what is real and what is not, but there are some things you can do to avoid buying fakes. Ask yourself, is this suspiciously cheap? Is good to be true? Does it use words such as genuine, or real, orauthentic? And also really simple things such as whether the spelling and grammar is correct, because if not, it is probably not a luxury brand. Some people do do all of those things such as Phoebe who bought the here straighteners and she still ended up with fakes, and obviously a lot of the reason people are buying online is that they haven’t got the time to go into the shops, but if people are worried, they can check if websites officially recognise-- the website is officially recognised. Thank you for the advice. The least punctual train service in the country arrived early today, but only after changes were made to the timetable. The 07.29 from Brighton to Victoria didn’t arrive on time once last year. But today it arrived two minutes early, as the journey time was extended by three minutes. The company said it made the changes to the timetable to make it more reliable. One of Berkshire’s busiest river crossings closed. Travellers have been warned to make extra time furtherjourneys while the closure is in place. Next: ""Gay, dyslexic, and an ex-alcoholic"" - an unusual pitch in politics, but would it get your vote? The man who wants to be the Conservative candidate for Mayor is hoping so. Ivan Masso launched his campaign today. It comes as the former mayor of London Ken Livingstone endorsed Tooting MP Sadiq Khan to be Labour’s candidate. Our Political Correspondent Karl Mercer reports. This is the traditional way to do your political campaigns. Can you put your shoulder on to... Line up your supporters, get some big-name backers, and throw in a dog called Coco for good measure. I’m gay. I’m an ex-alcoholic. And a dyslexic. This is perhaps less traditional, to put it mildly, but these were the two offers in town today from people who want to be London’s next mayor. I’m a businessman. The millionaire Conservative Ivan Massow’s campaign is right up there for strangest political video. The Conservatives haven’t yet announced how they will select a candidate, the deputy mayor for policing, Steven Greenhouse and the Tory’s leader on the London assembly have also said they want the capital’s top job. He admits he is an outsider in the race. He once left the party and joined Labour, but says he is serious about becoming mayor. I think it is going to be about housing, primarily. It is also going to be about inequality and bridging the gap between the rich and the poor. The London living wage and things like that. But for me it is also about keeping London important on the world stage. We are a torch bearer for best practice. A decade ago, Ken Livingstone was a torch bearer for the Olympics, alongside Tessa jowell. She is expected to launch her campaign to be mayor tomorrow. But today Ken joined former Bethnal Green MP oona King, saying he is backing Sidiq Khan for the topjob. Sadiq’s politics are closer than mine and Tessa’s are but frankly none of the Labour candidates are somebody that shouldn’t be mayor. I mean, we have got a really rich field to choose from and so far no one has emerged from the Tory side. It is a very clear sign of what is coming next year. They have both known me for many years and I’m really, really proud and humbled that they are backing me to be Labour’s candidate for Mayor of London. In many ways, they are two losers. Bethnal Green went spectacularly wrong for oona King, and Ken lost a Labour city. What is really important is that I have the ability to take advice from people who have done the job before. In the coming weeks, his Labour rivals and those from other parties will no doubt be rolling out big-name supporters of their own. Still to come tonight: From Chelsea to Poplar- why a show garden from the flower show is being relocated to this corner of East London. And find out how many showers you will have to dodge. I will have the weather forecast later on. Could the man who led England’s rugby union team to victory in the 2003 World Cup take over the national squad? Reports in France claim Sir Clive Woodward is on a shortlist. Let’s get more from our sports reporter Sara Orchard. What do you make of this? It is splashed all over the French press. Claims that Sir Clive Woodward could be taking over as head coach of France. That would be after the World Cup this year. The claims are met with eight other candidates. We were told they would not disclose who is in consideration for the role just yet. This will break Welsh hearts, because it has been confirmed that the British and Irish line and Wales centre Daley Roberts will be joining harlequins after the World Cup later this year. And do something completely different. Some kite surfing news. When we say kite surfing, a lot of people will think of these kind of pictures, sun and surf. However, a team of four adventurers have taken us to a very different place. They have broken the record for the fastest crossing of Greenland by kite surfing. They travelled 350 miles, coast to coast, knocking more than eight hours of the previous record and spent 17 hours going straight across to complete the distance. You have got this the enormous 11+ square metre kite that is blowing wildly around in the sky. You have to be concentrating 110%, because just the slightest edge on the ski against one of these ridges of rock art snow could send you on the most enormous tumble. They reached speeds of 25 mph. There are the few frostbitten toes and they said when they come back they are planning a big party and then planning-- but they are not planning another expedition any time soon. Within the past hour, Her Majesty the Queen has been visiting this year’s Chelsea Flower Show ahead of its opening to the public tomorrow. Among the exhibits, a garden celebrating the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta and a show garden reflecting the capital’s diverse communities. Let’sjoin Katharine Carpenter, who’s there for us this evening. Welcome to Chelsea, and this is the healthy cities garden. While most of the gardens get operated at the end of the show and dug up and the plants taken away, this one will have a lasting legacy. We can speak to its designer, Chris Beard shot. Chris, what does it mean to you to design a garden that you knew would have a future? Right from the outset, we knew that the healthy cities initiative wanted to relocate this garden to the heart of the east of London and soul that immediately gives a wonderful narrative for us to feast on in the creation of the garden and one of those references, for instance, is to be very trees which punctuate this space and in the east of London where we are going to put the garden, the trees would initially have grown in wetland and would have had their heads cut off. The timber would then be harvested and used in the travel industry. This would then be used in the burgeoning City of London, so we knew we wanted the garden to be punctuated with these wonderful trees. Firstly, let’s have a look at where this garden is going to end up. Surrounded by flats, these garden boxes might seem a world away from the short suppers at Chelsea, but to the community which tends them, they are just as valuable. Really nice. We’re really happy to have it, because we can do our own fruits and vegetables and there is space for ourselves. This passion for plants has not gone unnoticed by their neighbours in Canary Wharf. Now banking giant Morgan Stanley will be upgrading its celebrity designed Chelsea garden and transporting it to this estate. We can’t wait for it to start. This is what is heading their way, the healthy cities garden. Among the blooms, tiles painted by schoolchildren. Another London garden which will have life beyond Chelsea is this celebration of the 800th celebration of the signing of the Magna Carta. This is the apothecary rules. It is an example of a typical medieval rules that would have been seen in those times. These are some beautifully scented honeysuckles, and a bench which is rapidly saved to sit on. On the bench, we placed a medieval chess set to represent the power struggle between King john, the church, and the barons. As it took shape last week, specially commissioned pennants were put into place, the work of an embroiderer who had worked on Kate Middleton’s wedding dress. It was absolutely amazing when they rang me up and asked me to do this, and to be at Chelsea, it is amazing. This garden will find a fitting permanent home at a hotel, and even the rain this morning could not dampen the spirits of Chelsea enthusiasts, orthose not dampen the spirits of Chelsea enthusiasts, or those promoting this your’s gardens and there lasting legacy. Of course, what you do not get on the television is the sense of smell it here. It is amazing. These flowers here representing diversity of the area. Yes, absolutely. We are trying to demonstrate that colours which wouldn’t necessarily go together if you looked at them as a colour swatch, they could be antagonistic, they can be used very effectively and very positively, and in a way thatis and very positively, and in a way that is a metaphor for the urban society. That in the right context and with the right infrastructure in place, it is possible to have tremendous diversity in our society and also sustainability. just briefly, as a professional gardener, have you feel about these residents taking over your work and looking after it in future. It is wonderful. That is what the garden has designed for. Morgan Stanley are going to provide the help and training for those gardeners, and this is part of a much wider project of growing spaces and medals and vegetable beds. Thank you very much. An amazing thing for these residents, but quite a responsibility to. It looks amazing. I wish I was there with you. Thank you very much. The Godfather is in London this week. Tonight sees the premiere of Al Pacino’s latest film in which he plays an ageing rock star who decides to change his life when he discovers a Ao-year-old letter sent to him byjohn Lennon. And later this week, the 75-year-old Hollywood star will be hosting an evening with Londoners talking about his career. Our Entertainment Correspondent Brenda Emmanus caught up with him on the red carpet. It isa It is a charming story inspired by a true story. What attracted you to the role? It is usually the script, and it was a good script, I thought. It was interesting and it is a true story in part. The writer took the truth of what happened and elaborated on it, and it is full of heart. It is funny too. Will you marry? Do it. Dinner. You are asking me to dinner? Yes, I think so. I’m sorry. Are you on drugs? Currently, or in general? In general. Not currently. You will be spending some time with your London fans who will share an audience with you. What did about that experience that you enjoy? This is my connecting city. From London to New York and from New York to London. I love it here. You did the Palladium before, now he will do the Apollo in Hammersmith. I won’t quit. Ijust keep coming. I love it. As well as film, theatre is a great passion for you. There is a rumour you might be back on the West End stage. I am always hoping I can come back. Itry End stage. I am always hoping I can come back. I try to get back. I think I will be coming back maybe in a year or two back, because I have young children also. I think I should be in one place at this point. Does London inspire you as a city? Yes, it always inspires me. It certainly inspires me because of the great theatre here and writers and also just the life, great theatre here and writers and alsojust the life, the people who live here. And he is most welcome. Right, time for a check on the weather, Wendy. Should we be thinking about taking our wellies to Chelsea? I think that mightjust be the ticket, at least for the next couple of days. It started all fully this week, didn’t it? We will still have some showers into the start of this week and we should also see some sunny spells. The other feature is the wind gusting at A7 mph. For this time of year, it is quite lonely. It continues to be breezy through the evening at the night and there could be some showers before the sun sets, but mostly it is dry out there by now. just one or two going across the country brought in by that westerly breeze. It does mean that even with the clear sky it is not going to be too cold. No lower than five Celsius. From the outset tomorrow, there could be some showers around. Grab an umbrella. The drierand showers around. Grab an umbrella. The drier and brighter weather will be first thing. As the day goes on, those showers will be swept towards London and the Home Counties and in some places, they will be very heavy with some thunder and some lightning and hail. A cold day. So if you’re heading to Chelsea, this is how it is looking. The best chance of some sunny weather will be first thing in the morning. More showers in the afternoon. It will be breezy for the first day of the show as well. After that, high pressure starts to build in. That is going to kill of the showers at least, so it is looking slightly brighter and more settled as we go through the second part of the week. Here is the outlook for that. Some sunny spells, largely dry conditions. Temperatures will pick up. 19 Celsius and 20 Celsius. A nurse has been found guilty of murdering two patients and poisoning twenty others at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport in 2011. A jury heard that Victorino Chua had contaminated saline bags and drips using insulin. David Cameron has outlined his vision of improved NHS services at weekends, calling on hospitals in England to introduce new shift patterns and ensure that senior staff are available on Saturdays and Sundays. An unprecedented third inquest started today into the death of Carmel Bloom. That is all. Thanks forjoining us. Goodbye. Have you got what it takes to get those red chairs spinning? To enter, go to... Applications close midnight, May 29th. The clock is ticking. Hello and welcome to The One Show with Alexjones. And Matt Baker. Tonight we are talking twins with our twins.

You saw more of us than you would like to, yes. We had more than we bargained for but it was lovely. Now, this time you are doing a show called, Is Binge Drinking Really That Bad? It’s been a hot topic in the office today, hasn’t it? It has. Everybody’s got an opinion? Yes. We are going to look at that in-depth later on and hopefully get some answers. First, another set of twins whose genes could well teach science a thing or two. At 101, identical twins Doris and Freda from Devon along with two sisters are the oldest siblings in the world. Angelica Bell went to meet them. The key to a long and happy life is a good diet, regular exercise and lots of laughter. So I’m here in ban Stamle North Devon to talk to four sisters to find out if that is true. Phyllis is 93, Gladys is 96 and twins Freda and Doris recently turned 101. Between them, they have a combined age of 391 and are now thought to be the world’s oldest siblings. It must be incredibly exciting to know that you are going to be in the record books? Oh, yes. Never thought about it. It’s marvellous really. We’ve all got to this age. I don’t know what our parents would think about it. When mum was 70, we gave her a party and ",,
75,BBC1 London,18-may-2015,BBC News at Ten,22:00,25 mins,True,"A nurse is found guilty of murdering two people and poisoning 20 in a hospital in Greater Manchester. Victorino Chua put insulin into saline bags and drips. He described himself as ""an angel turned evil."" His victims came from two wards at Stepping Hill Hospital. When you’re in a hospital you think you’re safe. So, I didn’t think to ask questions. You know, you do as you’re told because they’re the experts. With questions over whether Chua was even qualified to work as a nurse, we’ll be asking why no concerns were raised about his training.

Later on BBC London: A third inquest opens into how a woman died following an operation at a private hospital. And the pub chain fined thousands of pounds for discriminating against travellers. Good evening. A nurse has been found guilty of murdering two patients and poisoning 20 others at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport. A jury at Manchester Crown Court heard that Victorino Chua had contaminated saline bags and drips using insulin while working on two acute wards in 2011. Stockport NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the Hospital, said it was unimaginable that any nurse would want to harm their patients, and has described the crimes as ""utterly shocking"". Our correspondent, Ed Thomas, is at Stepping Hill Hospital tonight. Inside this hospital Victorino Chua was trusted by his colleagues and his patients. But the reality was a nurse out of control. Wanting to cause harm and suffering to the very people he was meant to protect. He is the nurse who wanted to kill. No comment. Victorino Chua, the Stepping Hill poisoner. For the first time, we hear from the families left grieving and the patients who survived. In the summer of 2011, Chua began a poisoning spree. He murdered 83-year-old widower Derek Weaver and Tracey Arden, a mother with two children. Many more were given saline, spiked with insulin. It is a nightmare to leave them... Their mother was poisoned by Chua. She survived by died weeks after he was caught. It is reel liceation of what she must -- caught. It is reel liceation of what she must-- realisation of what she must have felt. At the end she had a lovely message just to say, stick together and enjoy your life. Make the most of it. Chua allowed us to film him here in Stockport. Off camera, he told me the claims were lies. His patients loved him. One woman, he said, even wanted to marry him. The truth was revealed in his own words in this letter found hidden at his home. He called it the bitter nurse confession. He wrote: I am a nice person, but there is a devil in me. Inside of mel am a nice person, but there is a devil in me. Inside of me I can feel the anger that any time it will explode. If I will be pushed, they are going to be sorry. Victorino Chua took out his anger and frustration on the people who needed him most. His own patients. Quietly, unnoticed, he poisoned them. In full view of his colleagues watched them suffer. How did you not notice him... This was Chua after his arrest. Is because you knew why he was in distress because you poisoned him. No comment. With ensue line. Refusing to ex-- insulin. When he was questioned by other staff who said, you cannot do that, that is not right, that is when he’s become very angry and that’s when he’s taken it out on the patients who he’s been charged to nurse and make better. This was chew filmed on -- better. This was chew filmed on -- this was Chua filmed on CCTV, pretending to care, while trying to kill. This woman was poisoned by Chua. I have lost faith in the NHS. It is a nightmare. When you are in a hospital you think you are safe. I didn’t think to ask questions. You know, you do as you are told. The BBC was given special access inside Stepping Hill. Nurses who administer insulin now work in pairs. They check each other’s work while the cameras check them. A hospital where staff and patients are now watched over like never before. Ifeel really are now watched over like never before. I feel really angry, actually, angry that a nurse could do this to patients when I know that this organisation is full of fantastic, caring, compassionate nurses and he choose to use his qualification to do harm. It has taken four years to get to the truth. To find Victorino Chua, the nurse who didn’t care if his patients lived or died. Greater Manchester Police say the investigation which led to Chua’s arrest and conviction was one of the biggest and most complex it’s ever carried out. Officers flew to Chua’s native Philippines, where their investigations cast serious doubt over his medical qualifications. Our health correspondent, Sophie Hutchinson, reports. Is this certificate real? This is photo actually Victorino Chua? When British detectives arrived in Manila, these were their concerns. On the streets here there’s clear evidence of an illicit trade in fake documents, as the BBC discovered. Around 35 people asking for that certificate. Fora Around 35 people asking for that certificate. For a diploma it is around 1500. That is around £20. Police suspect Chua had used fake nursing documents. This now ominous photo suggests he enrolled to study nursing, but police think he may never have completed training. The BBC tracked down the former registrar of a local medical college. A copy of his diploma. Who confirmed he had been a student, but couldn’t say whether the final paperwork was falsefied I can remember he requested for the United Kingdom. I don’t know if there were some changes made by somebody else. When Chua arrived in the UK, in 2002, all the nurses regulator here required was a photocopy of a certificate and confirmation from a foreign regulator that the person had been registered to work as a nurse abroad. The system was so lax that just over two years ago, when concerns were raised, all applications from outside the EU had to be suspended. Since then, the rules have been significantly tightened. The chief investigator of Chua’s case still has concerns. If there are a small number of nurses amongst that group who are either not nurses, or who are not qualified enough to be nurses, or who have been disciplined in their own country, then those are matters which should be of concern to all of us. And despite additional checks now having been made on Filipino nurses the regulator admits some unqualified staff could still be working in our hospitals. It is always possible. It cannot be absolutely ruled out. What I would say is, you would expect, if someone is not a nurse, that would be detected. Tonight, many questions remain unanswered. Did Chua ever complete the nurse training? Did he use forged documents? And why did he come to kill in the UK? The Prime Minister says he wants the NHS in England to be the first in the world that is ""truly a seven-day a week"" service. In his first major speech since the Conservatives won the election, David Cameron said that by 2020 he wanted everyone in England to have access to a GP in the evenings and at weekends. But doctors’ representatives said without detail the announcement was ""empty headline-grabbing"". Our health editor Hugh Pym’s report contains flash photography. The NHS was one of the main battle grounds during the election. Today, the Prime Minister wanted to show how he could deliver on his pledges. Good afternoon. .. This call-centre covering 70,000 people in Birmingham connects patients with a GP or gets them an on-the-day appointment at their local surgery, 8:00am-8:00pm. And it was here David Cameron came to flesh out his plan for a seven-day-a-week NHS in England. So a new deal for GPs with more investment... He wants hospitals and surgeries to provide more services at weekends, but how will that be achieved? REPORTER: Prime Minister, GP practices are already saying there are major recruitment problems. Where are you going to find the extra doctors to provide full seven-day-a-week access? We have about 1,000 more GPs in the NHS than when I became Prime Minister. We are training and hiring many more right now. You will go in increasingly to health centres where you have practice nurses. You’ve got people that can help with mental health problems. You’ve got physios who can help with physical problems. You will find far better services there available in your GP surgeries. If it is an emergency and I need to see somebody... Patients like Carol appreciate the way the service works. It will soon be seven days a week. My doctor, as I phone him, he will say, ""Come down in an hour.""' Or, ""Can you make it in half an hour?""' I can see him immediately. I am not left hanging about. One GP in north London argues the Prime Minister is making unrealistic promises. It’s up to two weeks in many practices to see a GP. So, what we need to do is get the basics right and not be making promises that in fact don’t bear any reality. NHS chiefs in England have suggested that a minimum of £8 billion will be needed above inflation in the year 2020 from Government, on top of extremely ambitious efficiency savings just to maintain the same sort of level of care as now. Offering a broader range of services on top of that will be far from easy. Mr Cameron says he will find the £8 billion, but there are warnings it’s not enough for his new plans. That will cover some of the existing pressures in the service. It won’t be enough to fulfil the commitments the Conservative Party made during the election campaign to do even better than the NHS is doing today. So, the money will be very tight. Delivering on the promises to patients will certainly be a major test of this Government. The Shadow Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, who is standing in the contest to be the next leader of the Labour Party, has strongly criticised Ed Miliband. Yvette Cooper said in a newspaper interview tonight that under its former leader the party sounded ""anti-business, anti-growth and ultimately anti-worker. "" Let’sjoin our political correspondent in Westminster tonight. And this is a marked change in direction from Yvette Cooper. It was days ago Yvette Cooper was standing side by side with Ed Miliband as they fought the election campaign together. Now, she’s going back on all that, saying that under Ed Miliband, the party alienated business and it needs to re-set its relationship with business. She even distances herself from policies that her husband, the former Shadow Chancellor, helped to put in place. And, as Yvette Cooper tries to position herself as the candidate of the centre, her main rival, Andy Burnham has won the backing of Dan jarvis and before he ruled himself out of the race Mrjarvis was the man many pinned their hopes on as the new Labour leader. All the candidates need to win the backing of Labour MPs here in Westminster. That is the start of it. After that, in the weeks and months to come, they need to win over the hundreds of thousands of people across the country who will have their say in a one-member, one vote ballot for the new leader and that is where the hard work really starts. Thank you very much. Shia militia fighters are gathering east of the Iraqi city of Ramadi to prepare for a counter-attack against so-called Islamic State militants. The Iraqi government hopes the militiamen can help re-take the city and reverse what’s been describe as IS’s most significant gain for nearly a year. But there are concerns that sending Iranian-backed Shia forces into Ramadi, which is predominantly Sunni Muslim Anbar Province, could further stir sectarian tensions, as our World Affairs Editor, john Simpson reports. Ramadi under Islamic State - shocked, silent, fearful. The only people on the streets are IS volunteers. The most important town in this whole part of Iraq, 60 miles west of Baghdad, is entirely in their hands. Ramadi has been surrounded by IS for a year now, but it’s always held out. At the end, the fighting was bitter, 500 people died. But the Iraqi army’s will to resist collapsed and the soldiers fled, terrified they’d be caught and butchered. This used to be a city of 500,000, but large numbers have fled - 25,000 in the last few days alone. They have taken refuge outside the city, where Islamic State can’t reach them. TRANSLATION: There’s chaos and violence everywhere, it’s terrifying, shells and bombs have destroyed many houses and we’ve heard that a lot of families have been killed. It’s always been a serious shock to the Iraqi government, which had thought it was pushing IS back everywhere. It’s also a defeat for American policy. In one way, the loss of Ramadi actually solves a problem for the Iraqi government. In pushing back Islamic State from those areas it controls now, it couldn’t decide whether to try to recapture Mosul up in the north first, and then liberate Anbar Province in the west, or start with Anbar and finish up with Mosul. Now, Ramadi and Anbar will have to come first. Sorting out Mosul will be months away. As ever in Iraq, the big underlying problem is a sectarian divide between Sunnis and Shias. Ramadi is a Sunni city. If Shia militiamen like these are sent there, there could be bloodshed. But some analysts are optimistic. What is significant about this recent campaign in Ramadi is that the local Sunnis themselves have called on the Shia fighters to come into the city and help them defeat ISIS. This Sunni-Shia co-operation is crucial and will pave the way for more successful campaigns in Iraq. In the city of Mosul, crowds of delighted Islamic State supporters greet the news that Ramadi has fallen. But the Iraqi government and the Americans are confident they will recapture Ramadi soon. The only thing is, they will probably need help from Iran-backed Shia militias to do it. john Simpson, BBC News. A BBC TV crew has been arrested and detained in Qatar while on an official visit to report on the conditions of migrant workers building the stadiums and infrastructure for the 2022 World Cup. The team were stopped by security services as they gathered material. Our Middle East correspondent, Mark Lobel, along with his cameraman and translator, were interrogated, put in prison for two nights and accused of being spies. Here’s his report. Since the tiny Gulf State of Qatar stunned the world by winning the chance to host football’s most dazzling tournament, it’s attracted worldwide attention, but that has come at a price. A focus on the housing and working conditions of low-skilled migrant workers. There are no complaints at this brand-new accommodation complex we were shown by the government. A luxury swimming pool, a well-equipped gym - workers on the main World Cup projects housed here are the lucky ones. TRANSLATION: Everything is good here. My lifestyle has changed. It’s a better, more hygienic place to live. On the other side of town, and away from our PR minders, we joined a bus-load of labourers to see where the majority of migrants live now. Many have been here for years and endure the long hours and lack of holiday in order to send money back home. We’d heard conditions were a far cry from what we had seen earlier. What we didn’t know is that we were being followed by the state security service. Our arrest was dramatic. Eight cars drove us off the road as we left the centre of Doha. The cameraman, driver, translator and I were treated like spies and interrogated separately by security officers. Our camera and footage were seized. In handcuffs, were we hauled in front of a prosecutor. He accused us of disrespecting Qatar and threatened us with a spell behind bars to teach us a lesson. Then, after two nights in a filthy prison, just as suddenly as we had been arrested, they let us go. Fifa say they are investigating what happened to us. They say any restriction to press freedom will be looked into with the seriousness it deserves. The BBC and foreign media have uncovered horrible living conditions here before. It has become a constant irritation for the government. No proper explanation for why we had been detained was given and, within hours of us being set free, the government was behaving as if nothing had happened. So, I asked the labour minister if the security services were being overly paranoid about the media. I’m more paranoid than they are. I’m facing it day in, day out, morning and evening. Sometimes I wake up at night and I open up one of the national TV channels, there is Qatar executing workers in the street. The figures that we have, whatever small it is, it is too much. But it is by far less what has been reported in international press. As Qatar’s World Cup approaches, the focus on migrant labour is only likely to increase. Unexpectedly, how this country handles the media is also becoming a concern. Mark Lobel, BBC News. EU defence and foreign ministers meeting in Brussels have approved plans to establish a naval force to combat people-smugglers operating from Libya. The EU’s foreign affairs head, Federica Mogherini, said the aim of the operation was to disrupt the business model of traffickers who smuggle people across the Mediterranean to Europe. Our Europe Editor, Katya Adler, is in Berlin tonight and, Katya, the EU is expected to seek United Nations support for the mission will that happen? Well, today was about launching that naval operation in the Mediterranean. All the EU countries have come under huge public pressure to take action against those people smugglers dubbed the most ruthless travel agents in the world! The military component was not unexpected. It is significant, but there are still huge questions. We have seen those tiny dinghies packed with desperate people at sea. If the EU starts a bombing campaign, the risk of innocent people losing their lives will be considerable. The EU is seeking the UN’s blessing, the UK is drawing up a draft UN Security Council Resolution proposal. The UN Secretary-General says he is not keen and Libya has outright rejected the plan. There is another important aspect to today’s news as the UK re-examines its relationship with the EU ahead of a referendum. This is where the UK can play a huge role. I am is where the UK can play a huge role. Iam in Germany. It is where the UK can play a huge role. I am in Germany. It is seen as the key EU nation. When it comes to military action, it prefers to take a back-seat because of its past. The UK has the largest military in the EU, alongside France. The EU can benefit from the UK’s expertise and the British Government can take action on an issue it sees as very important but as part of that larger collective, the EU. Thank you. Thomas Cook is to donate £1.5 million to charity that it received in compensation for lost bookings after two children died while on holiday at a hotel in Corfu. The company has been strongly criticised by the parents of Bobby and Christi Shepherd, who were overcome by carbon monoxide from a faulty boiler. The new-look House of Commons convened for the first time since the General Election today. The Conservatives - with their first overall majority for 18 years - took their places opposite the diminished Labour Party benches and the swelled ranks of the SNP. The day came with a number of Commons traditions, as our Deputy Political Editor, james Landale, reports. It’s a new Parliament with old traditions. MPs may be elected by the people, but they can’t start work until the Lords and Ladies in hats and gowns have asked them to elect a Speaker, politely of course. We are commanded by Her Majesty to let you know that it not being convenient for her to be present here this day... So, with the Queen busy elsewhere, and not everyone paying full attention, MPs wasted no time to head back to the Commons to choose their Speaker, a democratic election with one candidate. I call Mrjohn Bercow... Who began with a joke at the expense of Labour and their stone-carved election promises. If there are five words that I would like carved on my political tombstone. .. LAUGHTER They are, ""He was the backbenchers’ champion."" Elected unchallenged, the Speaker was ceremonially dragged to his chair- he’s supposed to not want the job - and the politicians got down to the serious business of cracking jokes about each other. First up, the Prime Minister on Labour’s acting leader. There seems to be a common pattern - a man comes along and does the job and makes a terrible mess of it and she comes along and sorts it all out. The right honourable lady might be wondering, like me, why she’s not given the job on a permanent basis. She may not be in charge for long, but before she’s replaced in the autumn, she said Labour still had a job to do. I congratulate the right honourable member for Witney on returning to the House as Prime Minister. We applied for thatjob, but we didn’t get it, he got the job, but we have got a very important job of being the official opposition and we will be fearless and effective in doing that. With their 56 newly-elected MPs, the SNP hoped they’d too provide some opposition, revelling in their new status as the third party of Parliament. We still support the fair treatment of smaller parties, smaller parties like the Liberal Democrats... LAUGHTER So Parliament’s back, with more women, more ethnic minorities than before, but also with more Conservatives. Work starts formally next week when the Queen pops around for the State Opening. james Landale, BBC News, Westminster. He wrote some of our most famous choral music, hymns like jerusalem, as well as the Coronation anthem I Was Glad. Now, 70 of Sir Hubert Parry’s unpublished works have come to light - after decades hidden away in a family archive.

By Sir Charles Hubert Hastings Parry. 70 original manuscripts, written when Parry was studying at Eton and Oxford. After decades hidden away in a family archive, this week, they will be sold at auction. What I love about this, he obviously thought that’s not quite good enough, or I want to change it, so he cut out the original manuscript and then set in another piece of manuscript. And taped it in. Taped it in. Early forming of cutting and pasting. MUSIC: jerusalem The Golden And this is what they sound like. One of Parry’s newly-found anthems, now performed for the first time by the Choir of Gloucester Cathedral. CHOIR SING It was a really good feeling to have a great big pile of manuscripts that nobody had seen, not for at least 100 years. So, I hunted through them and sorted out some pieces which I thought were good. These works may not be as exceptional as jerusalem, but critics say they do show us how Parry, the music scholar, developed his style. It was a tingling factor up the spine in my back, the earliest part of Parry’s musical life coming to life. It’s fitting that these works are being performed here at Gloucester Cathedral. Tucked away in the gift shop you can see a memorial to Hubert Parry, who lived nearby and learnt to play the organ here.

Two inquests have already been held, both were quashed, and today an unprecedented third got underway at west London Coroners’ Court. Alpa Patel sent this report. It is a fight that has cost him over £2 million, he says, and over a decade of work. Bernard Bloom and his wife have won a third inquest into his sister’s death, a landmark decision awarded by the High Court. It has taken an emotional toll on the family. It has been very expensive and it has also cost the local authorities a lot of money. We want closure, we want to move on, and I have not had time to grieve for my sister because I have continuously been fighting forjustice here. Carmel Bloom, seen here on her wedding day, died in 2002, aftera routine kidney stone operation here at this Bupa-run hospital in Ilford. The first inquest, in 2003, found she died of natural causes, but that verdict was quashed a year later. A second inquest in 2005 found a lack of care after surgery played a part in her death, but that finding was also quashed. A third inquest is unprecedented and will hear fresh evidence, including, it is believed, this 999 call. Hello. I am the night sister at the hospital in Ilford.

Init, you can heara nurse describing the seriousness of her condition to the emergency services. She has got oedema and she is coughing up a lot of blood and she is very unstable. At the time Roding Hospital was run by Bupa, but is it now run by Spire Healthcare. A recent inspection by the Care Quality Commission found that the hospital met all of the key standards. In a statement, Bupa said that as a new legal hearing was beginning, we no longer own the hospital and it was not appropriate for us to comment any further. This August, it will be 13 years since Carmel Bloom died. Her family hope the third inquest will finally give answers they have been fighting for. Rats’ droppings, human urine and even arsenic are some of the shocking substances found in counterfeit beauty products. The warning comes from City of London Police, who say it’s putting people’s lives at risk and internet shopping has helped fuel a rise in fake products. They’re now urging consumers to be more aware of what they’re buying online. Here’s Tarah Welsh. Would you expect your favourite perfume to be made in a factory like this? Or your best lipstick created in conditions like these? No? Well, gangs are using these filthy laboratories to make fake goods. Then they’re being sold online to unsuspecting Londoners. Well, in perfumes, we have actually found human urine and also cyanide. And these are sort of luxury brand perfumes, perfumes that you probably think most of the time you can trust, and they are expensive to buy, and even the counterfeit products are usually quite expensive to buy, but you certainly don’t get what you think you are getting. It is electrical products too, which look genuine until they blow up. I could hear a funny buzzing sound coming from the straightener. Then all of a sudden a few sparks started to fly out, just come out from where the cable connected with the straightener, so quite close to my face. Then a loud bang and a flame just burst out from the strainer, and that is when Ijust dropped them on the ground and ran to the wall and switched them off at the wall. Thousands of websites promising the sort of products you’d find on the beauty counter have been shut down by police. They have confiscated £3.5 million worth of goods in over the past year and a half. Fake make-up accounts for 6% of sales in the beauty sector and costs the UK industry £201 million per year. Also several thousand jobs that are not created. The news is that the UK is actually doing better than the EU average, which has a rate of counterfeit of about 8%. Of course, it is not all about the impact on the industry. Counterfeit goods are often rip-offs of designer brands. When people buy them, they often think they are putting the best stuff on their face or hair, when actually it is quite the opposite. The poisonous chemicals in these goods can be scary, but so can what is missing. Fake sun cream often contains no protection, so some brands may be expensive, but cheap fakes can prove even more costly. A pub chain has been ordered to pay tens of thousands of pounds in compensation for racially discriminating against travellers. In a landmark case, a judge said the company was guilty of ""racial stereotyping’ after refusing a group of travellers entry to a Wetherspoon pub in Holloway in 2011. Marc Ashdown is outside the pub with more details. Four years FOUI’ yâ3I’S SQO movement in Britain had their annual conference, right next door to this pub in Holloway. A small group went for a drip income the pub, as they said they did every year. This time they were met by two bouncers who said no travellers were allowed in this year. This group contained a Catholic priest, a retired police officer and a human rights lawyer. They said it amounted to discrimination. They took a case to the whourt. Today, a judge agreed with them -- the whourt. Today, a judge agreed with them -- to the High Court. Today, thejudge agreed with them -- to the High Court. Today, the judge agreed with them. Thejudge said: He ordered the pub to pay each of the three £3,000 in damages. I spoke to one of them this afternoon after the judgments. to one of them this afternoon after thejudgments. He said it to one of them this afternoon after the judgments. He said it could well well be a landmark case. There’s a general attitude out there that travellers are Gypsies, mean trouble. Thisjudge has looked travellers are Gypsies, mean trouble. This judge has looked at it and he seas said that is a racially, ethnic, discriminatory attitude and has no place in 21st century Britain. What about the company itself? What has Weatherspoon had to say? Well, they have apologised for any distress or upset caused to the eight claimants. And in a statement this afternoon, Tim Martin says, ""we have been fully committed to operating our premises in a nondiscriminatory way."" They did say that ten other claimants failed in their case and thejudge dismissed claimants failed in their case and the judge dismissed other claims of harassment and aggravated damages, so staff did not behave in a hostile manner. Now we turn to costs, that is to be argued out. This has been a lengthy court battle. Costs likely to amount to £1 million. The hope of the traveller community is this will send out a message to owners of restaurants, shops, bars, venues, if you discriminate against them, you too could well end up in court. A businessman who wants to become the Conservative’s mayoral candidate next year has launched his campaign with a cartoon in which he introduces himself very candidly. ~ Iam I am gay. I am an ex-alcoholic. Entrepreneur Ivan Masso says he’s spending ""significant"" amounts of money using social media to boost his bid to replace Borisjohnson. Her Majesty the Queen has been visiting this year’s Chelsea Flower Show ahead of its opening to the public tomorrow. She’s been every year for the last half century. Among the exhibits in SW3 is a Show Garden reflecting the capital’s diverse communities that will be then relocated to Poplar in east London. As Katharine Carpenter reports. Surrounded by flats on a Poplar estate, these garden boxes might seem a world away from the show-stoppers at Chelsea, but to the community that tends them, they are just as valuable. Really nice. It is really wicked. We are really happy about it. It is like we can do our own fruits. We can do our own vegetables. We’ve got this space for ourselves. This passion for plants has not gone unnoticed by their neighbours in Canary Wharf. Now banking giant Morgan Stanley will uproot its designed Chelsea garden and transplant it, plants and all to this estate. It looks amazing. I cannot wait for it to start and make the most out of it. This is what is heading their way - the Healthy Cities Garden. Tiles painted by Poplar school children. Another London garden, which will have life beyond Chelsea is this celebration of the 800th anniversary of the signing of the Magna Carta. This is a rose and we wanted to incorporate it in the planting as an example of a typical medieval rose which would have been seen in those times. We have beautifully scented honeysuckle, a camomile bench which is safe to sit on. They would have sat on it? On the bench we place a medieval-style chess set to represent the power struggle between King john and the barons, obviously key to Magna Carta. As it took shape last week, specially commissioned pieces were put in place, the needlework of an embroider who worked on Kate Middleton’s wedding dress. It was amazing when I was asked to do this embroidery, and to be at Chelsea it is so prestigious. It is amazing. This garden will find a fitting permanent home at the Runnymede hotel. Even the rain could not dampen the spirits of Chelsea enthusiasts or those promoting this year’s gardens and their lasting legacy. Well, on that note let’s see how this week’s weather is shaping up. I’ll say goodnight and hand you over to Wendy Hurrell. So far, better for plants than the people. The weather has started unsettled. We begin with the showers and they are blown in on a stiff breeze. It will settle as the week goes on. Even out there at the moment, just west of London, there are a few showers pushed in on that continuing breeze. We could see a few through the night. From the outset you could do with a brolly first thing tomorrow morning. The drier, brighterweatherwill first thing tomorrow morning. The drier, brighter weather will come first tomorrow. As we go through the day, the breeze continues to blow and the showers will become more frequent and probably heavier as well into the afternoon and evening. I wouldn’t be surprised to hear a rumble of thunder and some hail. The temperature will struggle. 15 Celsius the best n the brighter spells. If you are going to Chelsea, the best of the brighter weather will be first thing. We have showers into the afternoon. It will be breezy and cool. As for Wednesday; well fewer showers about. The breeze will be easing back as we go through the day. The temperatures will pick UP the day. The temperatures will pick up a little bit. We should reach 18 Celsius. That process continues through Thursday and Friday. We have largely dry conditions. Some sunshine and temperatures up to 20 Celsius. As for the bank holiday, well at the moment, mostly dry. Some sunshine. Temperatures about average. It looks like it could buck the trend for May. The weather prospects more promising than May has been so far. It has been a month which has been wet for this time of year. Wetter than we would expect. More especially over western areas. Take Blackpool, we are only halfway through the morvent and we are getting close to -- are only halfway through the morvent and we are getting close to -- month and we are getting close to double the rain for the whole of There is still a good way for the rainfall totals to catch up. Not only has May been wet, but it has been colder than we would normally expect, especially by day. That trend continues for the next 24 hours. High pressure out to the Atlantic. With low pressure close by, we are keeping the showers going overnight. Heaviest around the western coasts. There could be the odd rumble of thunder. Winds strong enough to drive some further eastwards. Some will stay dry over the east. A drier end to the night over central and south-eastern Scotland. A cool start to Tuesday morning for all of you. At least drier through these eastern areas compared to this morning. The heaviest more frequent over the west. The strong winds will drive them further eastwards. Heavy with hail and thunder, over the Midlands, eastern England. Take note of that if you are off to the Chelsea Flower Show. Wherever you are it will be cool. Not as chilly on Wednesday. The winds strongest across eastern areas. Morning showers in the west starting to ease off later. That is because at last we start to see high pressure dominating, pushing in from the south-west to take us into a cool start for Thursday. Thursday andindeed cool start for Thursday. Thursday and indeed Friday, some cloud to western coasts and hills, most will be dry. Note the temperatures - starting to lift again, back to levels they should be at this stage of the month. A promising lead-up to the bank holiday. High pressure will build in again. It should be a fair day, with pleasant sunny spells. Into Sunday, the high recedes. Perhaps the wetter day of the weekend to the west, with more cloud and patchy rain. Into Bank Holiday Monday - ",,
79,BBC1 London,23-may-2015,BBC Weekend News,18:45,10 mins,True,"Good evening. Ireland has voted in favour of gay marriage. In doing so, it’s become the first country in the world to approve the change in a national referendum. The overall result has yet to be declared, but with counting completed in most constituencies, the yes campaign has won almost two thirds of the vote. From Dublin, Chris Buckler reports. Many C8f’I’Ip8igi’lâI’S Many campaigners saw this vote about same-sex marriage as a test of equality and acceptance in modern Ireland. In the centre of Dublin it was obvious what a Yes vote meant to them. Throughout the afternoon campaigners watched as the results came in from around the country. In front of the countless rainbow flags the map of Ireland turned green of a colour matching each of the areas voting yes, and representing change for gay and lesbian couples. It’s going to be the first time I’ve ever been able to walk down the street and not be afraid to hold her hand because everybody says it’s OK now. Everybody says it. What does it mean to you to even hear that? It means the world. I’m not less than anyone else. Far from this orations in Dublin the No vote was strongest in rural areas. The Catholic Church had campaigned against any change to the definition of marriage and in a place where it debates of morality tend to be rooted in religion and they are still a big influence. I think it goes against everything that I’ve been brought up with. Everything that I’ve learned in my church, anyway. And I think there will be repercussions. Deeply divided beliefs inspired a large turnout and this referendum engaged young voters in a way that few elections do. The yes campaigners even encouraged Irish people living abroad to come home and vote. Many did. I love it for the young people, I love seeing the young people happy and relaxed and not scarred the way the people of my generation were. Arguments about children and equality dominated the referendum campaign, and for no voters they still haven’t been answered. The Irish government will introduce surrogacy so we will be there to defend the rights of children, this is not the end for us. Today’s vote is important because it will give 9aY is important because it will give gay and lesbian couples in Ireland the same constitutional protections as any other family, if they marry. For many that is a watershed moment. In a country which only legalised homosexuality two decades ago. And Chris is in Dublin now. It’s an emphatic win for the Yes campaign. Absolutely and there have been extraordinary and very emotional scenes in a Berlin court yard this evening, because they are still waiting for the final result. But it’s clear this is a Yes vote. This has been set up in some ways as some kind of battle between church and state because Ireland’s main political parties have been on one side and the Catholic Church on the other. However, howeveryou look side and the Catholic Church on the other. However, however you look at this it’s worth reflecting on the language of the Catholic Church surrounding this. They have softened somewhat Investec Mensa and talked about acknowledging the love of same-sex couples. That says as much about change as anything else. As for the politicians it’s an overwhelming victory and some have been on the stage with their names being chanted by the crowd, including Ireland’s by Minister and that in itself is pretty extraordinary. Chris Buckler, thank you very much. The Bank of England has confirmed it has begun examining the financial impact of Britain leaving the EU - after it inadvertently emailed details of the confidential project to a national newspaper. Prime Minister David Cameron has promised an in/out referendum on the UK’s EU membership by the end of 2017. Our business correspondentjoe Lynam reports. The independent Bank of England suddenly finds itself at the centre of the next crucial question for the UK: Should it remain a member of the EU? The Bank itself has no opinion, but thanks to a leak to a newspaper we now know it is actively looking at what might happen if Britain left. One senior official e-mailed a handful of staff within the bank to say that no e-mail should be sent around the bank about the project code-named Bookend. It said that ifjournalists asked they should be informed that there is a lot going on in Europe but the investigation had nothing to do with the referendum. Given the fact that we expect the Bank of England officials to be thinking about every single eventuality, including a UK exit from the European Union, should we really be surprised that they are doing exactly that? It’s clearly unfortunate that it’s come out in this way via a leak, but I don’t think we should take it that seriously. It’s not as if they were doing a piece of work they shouldn’t be doing at all, or a piece of work that surprises us. Perhaps the surprise is that they wanted to be quite so secretive about it in the first place. When it became clear that the bank had accidentally e-mailed the Guardian it acknowledged its unfortunate mistake, and it added that it was not sensible to talk about its work publicly. As the date for the referendum gets closer voters will want as much information from trusted sources - like the Bank of England - as possible. Keeping crucial investigations a secret may become increasingly difficult. joe Lynam, BBC News. The bungalow at a Corfu hotel complex where two British children died of carbon monoxide poisoning is to be demolished. Christi and Bobby Shepherd from Wakefield died while on a Thomas Cook holiday in 2006. The hotel says the decision to destroy the bungalow was made following the inquest into the deaths ended last week. It ruled the children had been unlawfully killed. Forces loyal to the Iraqi government have begun a counter offensive against the so-called Islamic State. Shia fighters launched an operation to recapture the city of Ramadi - which fell almost a week ago - and are also battling IS militants around the northern town of Baiji, which is home to the country’s largest oil refinery. From Baghdad, our world affairs editor john Simpson sent this report. Ramadi fell to Islamic State last weekend. After a week of dreadful headlines the Iraqi government is hoping things may be starting to improve. Outside Baiji, Shia volunteers fighting alongside the Iraqi army, have made real progress in rescuing the town from the Islamic State fighters who have been besieging it for a year now. It’s all very different from what happened at Ramadi, which fell to Islamic State last weekend. That was a serious humiliation for the Iraqi government. And it gave the impression around the world that Islamic State was becoming unbeatable. It is men like these, volunteers for the so-called Popular Mobilisation Unit, who are now trying to take Ramadi back. Islamic State’s strength is the religious fanaticism of its fighters. These volunteer groups can match that with their own drive and enthusiasm. The Iraqi army, by contrast, simply doesn’t have the same motivation. The majority of the volunteers are Shia Muslims, who have answered the call of their religious leaders to join UP and defend the Iraqi government. There has been a lot of anxiety about the use of Shia troops in a place like Ramadi, which is overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim. Still, the volunteer groups do contain Sunni fighters as well, and the Government insists that the groups are under strict control. For now, anyway, the overwhelming priority is to force Islamic State out of Ramadi again. The entire credibility of the Iraqi government is at stake in this. But getting IS out of the whole of the surrounding Anbar Province may not turn out to be either quick or easy. john Simpson, BBC News, Baghdad.

A look at tomorrow’s weather: And after some rain overnight, it will become drier- but not for long. Showers will reappear in the afternoon, although it will feel a little warmer than today. Highs ofaround Highs of around 20 Celsius. That’s it. On behalf of the BBC London team for now, I wish you a very good evening. Good evening. A sunny start to the bank holiday weekend for many of you but I’m sure a few of you will disagree. There was an outline of stubborn cloud from the Peak District down to the south-east which produced one or two showers over the London area. Elsewhere a fine end to the day but we now turn our attention to western Scotland and Northern Ireland, heavy bursts of rain this evening working southwards sporadically, one or two will avoid the weather but by the end of the night it turns damp across northern England, Wales, Devon and Cornwall. Clear conditions follow in its wake and stays dry bits and clear skies at times towards the south and east. Temperatures around 11 degrees as we start Sunday morning. More grey skies tomorrow and a bit more rain as well. The rain chiefly across northern England, Wales, and the south-west to begin. Foggy around the coast and hills but brightening UP the coast and hills but brightening up as the rain pushes towards East Anglia and the South East. A few heavy bursts, one or two will avoid it altogether, lots of dry weather further north but cooler conditions too and a few showers in parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland. What if you are making plans for bank holiday Monday? Well, something a bit drier and brighter, holiday Monday? Well, something a bit drierand brighter, if ",,

The weekend brought us a bit of a mixed weather story, but many places saw some fine spring sunshine either on Saturday or on Sunday. We’re going to start this Week Ahead on a fairly dry and bright note, particularly across some Southeastern parts of the country, fairly mild here. We’ve got a weather front pushing South, but it fizzles out by the afternoon, so just a band of cloud across parts of England. Further North and West, scattered showers, and temperatures here in the mid to the high teens, whereas with the warmer air in the Southeast, we could well see 22 or 23 degrees come Monday afternoon. Some fine weather. Doesn’t last too long. The milder air gets squeezed away and what we’re going to see Monday night into Tuesday is the winds coming in from a westerly direction, blowing scattered showers around low pressure in the North. We’ll start off Tuesday morning certainly on a frost-free note with quite a bit of cloud, some showers, and the breeze from the word go. Most places in double figures first thing in the morning. We will continue to see some showery weather, but the warm air that will have been in charge to start the week gets squeezed away towards the near continent, and through the day on Tuesday, cooler air filtering in from the Northwest. That stays in place, in fact, for much of this week ahead. Through the day on Tuesday, you can see the winds blowing in from the West. Scattered showers almost anywhere first thing. By the afternoon, high pressure builds in from the West, so a gradually improving weather story. Some sunny spells across the country. A few showers continue in the far Northwest. Temperatures a little bit fresher compared to Monday. Around 11 to 19 degrees by Tuesday afternoon. Then through the latter part of Tuesday and overnight into Wednesday, what we’re going to see is that high pressure building in further from the South. You can see the isobars are well spaced. We’re going to have light winds, and it could be a chilly night. First thing Wednesday morning, around 6 degrees in the towns and cities. In the countryside, one or two places, particularly in the North, just dipping a little below freezing, so there could be a touch of frost. After that chilly start to Wednesday, it’s going to be a dry and fine day for many places, sunny spells. Small chance that we could see one or two showersjust cropping up across some Southern counties. But at the moment, that looks fairly unlikely. In the sunnier spells, temperatures around about 10 to 18 degrees, so a little bit fresher, again, compared to Tuesday. The high pressure doesn’t last too long. It moves away towards the East. What we see into Thursday is low pressure coming in from the Atlantic and associated weather fronts, too. So, I think Thursday is the next significant spell of wet and fairly windy weather moving across much of the country. It tends to put its way East, then pivot and head away towards the South. Northern parts of Scotland avoiding the wet weather through much of the day. Scattered showers following in behind. As we look towards the end of the week, on into Friday, a bit of a window in the weather here, low pressure easing away. We are tending to be between weather systems through the course of Friday. Fairly light winds, still some showers around first thing. It’s likely that they’ll ease away, but temperatures on Friday a little bit cooler once again. Highs around about 10 to 16 degrees. Gradually cooling down, I think, throughout much of this week. And things remaining reasonably unsettled looking towards next weekend and beyond, too. We’re likely to establish a predominantly northwesterly flow of air, perhaps at times coming in more from the westerly direction. But with those northwesterly winds, it’ll tend to be Northern parts of the country that’ll tend to see more in the way of showery rain. Further South and East, still a chance of some spells of rain, but we are looking at some drier weather and things a little bit brighter and warmer across some Southern counties of England in particular. So, fairly unsettled through the course of next weekend and beyond. Things turning a bit cooler. There’ll be some showers or some longer spells of rain. But the driest of the weather likely towards the South. So, it’s looking like a bit of a mixed bag for the next week and beyond, too. Have a good week, whatever you’re up to. Bye from me.

That’s all the headlines for you on BBC News. Now time for the business news with Rico and Asia Business Report. China’s Central Bank cut interest rates again, will it help to kickstart the country ‘s economy? As migrant workers flee fighting in Yemen, we look at the impact back home. Thanks forjoining us for this Monday edition of Asia Business Report Hyon BBC One. China has cut interest rates for the third time in six months, in a bid to rekindle the country ‘s economy which is heading for its lowest growth rate in nearly a quarter century. The People’s Bank of China lowered its one-year lending rate by .25%. Would it have an impact? Earlier, I spoke to the head of trading for Asia. Hopefully, over time, these cuts will have an impact. The focus is on growth and keeping it at 7%. They are struggling a little at the moment. Inflation is coming up, this is catching up with inflation, and as the market is expected, another cut here. More to come as well. More to come? Inflation is in the highest %. How many more can we expect from the People’s Bank of China? Like in the US, it is dependent. As I say, the greatest number of 7% is important, but like other economies, other central banks, they third-largest economy, japan, interest rates are also heading in that direction, if growth continues to slow down? The IMF says we could see it at 6% by 2017? I think they will fall, there will be more cuts. I don’t think we are hitting that territory. With a growth rate down at 6%, there should still be inflation pressures in the economy. Of course, official rates will catch up with inflation. We will have a stable environment, with a natural and real interest. Could this lead to other central banks in the region, to follow the lead of the Chinese, and cut interest rates again? You have the likes of Indonesia, South Korea, Australia, cutting rates of the last six months? Well, maybe, but let’s not forget a lot of these economies are dependent on the US, and they are going in the other direction. What we are discussing now is whether it is September, December, that is imported. Already there is talk this morning. People are forecasting in New Zealand to go out over summer. It is interesting to see the direction of these economies at the moment. A five-day truce begins tomorrow in Yemen where Saudi lead early -- Everett have killed at least 400 people in recent weeks. The conflict means migrant workers, many from India, are heading home, cutting off a major source of income for families back home. India received about $70 billion in remittances last year, more than anywhere else in the world, including China and more than doubled the amount of other countries like the Philippines, Mexico and Nigeria. Remittance comes from Indians working in places like Australia, Canada and the US. More than half the money is sent back from the Gulf states. A flight with a difference. Thousands of people, mainly Indian citizens, evacuate from Yemen last month, after the government there was out -- month, after the government there was out-- ousted and month, after the government there was out -- ousted and violence spread across the country. This woman was one of them. Now back in her village in southern India. She had only moved to Yemen in September last year. Her nurses salary of $700 a month was three times the amount she was earning here. And, the family she left back in India, including her parents, Sun and sister, were depending on her financially. Now, of course, she is worried. -- financially. Now, of course, she is worried. -- son. TRANSLATION: I borrowed money to get a Visa to go to Yemen. I hope to improve my financial situation. Now I don’t have money to buy another Visa to go abroad, I have to look for a job somewhere in India. It is a big relief to be out of Yemen, and the back somewhere safer and more peaceful. But it has also left those rescued with an uncertain future. They went to Yemen to own more money. Often because they have struggled to find work back at home, orto struggled to find work back at home, or to earn far more. The question for many is, what next? And, the answer, for some, is to return as soon as it is safe to do so. Living in another country... Francis Xavier is one of them. He had been living in the Gulf nation with his wife for about 20 years, working in a travel and tourism company. Now, the family is in limbo. Francis says he cannot imagine his future anywhere other than Yemen. He hopes he can return soon. I got everything from Yemen. I have nothing here. Yemen is my country, I hope it turns good. The people are good. Very nice people. They are very good people. So, I enjoy Yemen. I have good contacts, more in Yemen. For now, there is no clarity over when Yemen ‘s conflict will end, and when people like Francis can return. That means uncertainty for thousands of India’s migrant workers. In other business news making headlines, Greece ‘s Prime Minister says he is hopeful an upcoming eurozone meeting could pave the way for a deal with the country ‘s creditors. Athens hopes for a portion of the $8.1 billion in remaining bailout loans to be released. One of the Greek senior negotiators says that the two sides were very close to an agreement. Chinese President Xi jinping is on a three-day trip to Belarus where he is expected to sign a $15.7 billion deal. China has already agreed to a five-year memorandum, and extended loans totalling one -- five-year memorandum, and extended loans totalling one -- $1 billion to Belarus banks. Prices have been on a rollercoaster after hitting highs last week, they have finished lower. This is how they are trading. The focus today will be on the China rate cut and the USjobs report, what is the outlook? Earlier, I spoke to an oil expert. It is the environment of low interest rates that will continue to contribute to the storage of crude oil. One of the key elements in rebounding demand has been the lower prices. And also large crude cargo would cost you $130 million. the course of the year. That is less than half of what it would cost you backin than half of what it would cost you back in 2009, when we had a very similar oversupply environment. If there is a storage of more crude, this would add to the global inventory is, and bring prices down from their current levels? That really depends on whether the crude is being consumed -- really depends on whether the crude is being consumed -- in centuries. We see remarkable demand growth in Asian consumption, in South Korea it is up in 9%, in China it is the same, despite slowing economic growth in that country. In places like India as well, despite the removal of subsidies, we continue to see strong demand for growth across south-east Asian economies as well. So, it is that demand growth, coupled with the ability of countries to put it into storage, thatis countries to put it into storage, that is providing support to prices. What about the OPEC? Are they content with the current price levels? Does Saudi Arabia want to cut oil production to boost prices? Actually, it’s the opposite. Now we see that Saudi Arabia is producing record levels, 10.3 million barrels daily. Or10.15, record levels, 10.3 million barrels daily. Or 10.15, just according to most recent April figures. This strengthening production is meant to keep oversupply in the market, and to the degree that it is possible capping prices, so that you see more of the shale output coming from the US. We have already seen stabilisation of US production, but with these higher prices, some producers have been able to hedge. And hedge out further into the future. They might be able to maintain that output. That would go against OPEC macro strategy of increasing production to reduce prices. -- OPEC’s strategy. Before we leave, let’s have a quick look at the markets... A positive day so far in Asia. The China rate cut, and more US jobs, they have boosted market sentiment in mid-morning trade. Investors injapan, Australia and South Korea are excited with these developments. On Wall Street... The US stock market had the best day in two months. That was on Friday following good news from the job market. Those are the markets at this hour, thank you for investing your time with us on Asia Business Report. See you next hour.

It’s been a key evening in the British showbusiness calendar with the BAFTA television awards taking place in London. The awards celebrated performances in front of the camera and the very best behind-the-scenes talent. Our entertainment correspondent Lizo Mzimba was on the red carpet. Some of the biggest stars of the small screen were out on the red carpet, for a night honouring the very best TV. Tonight isn’t necessarily about which shows or performers are the most popular. It is about which are judged to be of the highest quality by the industry, and such recognition from their peers is of huge importance to the nominees, and particularly to the winners. Anything that I have said, I have said to the police... The Lost Honour of Christopher jefferies, the true story of how a retired teacher became engulfed in a news frenzy, after being arrested for a murder he hadn’t committed, won two awards - Best Miniseries and Best Actor, forjason Watkins. It is a brilliant script and it’s about real events and real people, and things that happened that are relevant. And it tells a story beyond just a thrilling tale, or a particular genre, it tells of real events. Also winning two awards - Marvellous, another true story, about the extraordinary life of a man called Neil Baldwin. It won Best Single Drama and Best Supporting Actress for Gemma jones. jessica Hynes won her first BAFTA, taking Best Female Comedy Performance for her role in BBC satire W1A. Veteran broadcaster Clive james couldn’t attend the ceremony, but received a special award recognising his huge contribution to television. I will be back Hello, I’m Nick Marshall-McCormack and this is Sport Today from the BBC Sport Centre. Coming up: Champion of the clay in Madrid - Andy Murray beats Rafael Nadal, two weeks away from the French Open. Champions Chelsea put an end to Liverpool’s slim hopes of Champions League football. And pole to chequered flag - Nico Rossberg wins his first grand prix of the season in Barcelona. Here is a message for all you guys and girls out there wondering whether to tie the knot. Andy Murray has declared ""marriage works,"" after winning the Madrid Open by beating Rafael Nadal. The Spaniard will drop to world number seven now, putting him outside the top five for the first time in a decade. And that could give him a tougher draw at the French Open. Rafael Nadal’s Kingdom is built on clay. So, on his home surface, in his home country, his authority is absolute. Six times Andy Murray has played him on clay, six times he has lost. And yet Murray looked dominant in the first set, taking it 6-3. The world number three played on Spanish clay as a teenager, playing in Barcelona. But this is the servers that Nadal normally excels on, and at the start of the second set, this. But not for long. This simply doesn’t happen for Nadal, who has won the tournament four times. Nadal, who has won the tournament fourtimes. He four times. He was swept away in straight sets. Since his wedding last month, Murray’s form has surged. Traditionally he has struggled on clay. What has changed? Well, in his own words, marriage works. ~ I wasn’t expecting this a couple of weeks ago. So when things are unexpected, it tends to... It feels nicer. I didn’t feel like I put too much pressure on myself in the last couple of weeks, which is a good thing. But yes, obviously to win a Masters series on clay is a step in the right direction. It is something I have never done before. So that is good progress there. And obviously to win against Rafa on clay in a final in Spain is an extremely difficult thing to do, and I am proud that I have managed to do that. You cannot win against a player like Andy playing the way I played today. That’s it. That simple. I said that to date was not the right day. For me. And I congratulate Andy because he is playing great, winning last week in Munich, and I think the first time in his career clay here is playing well in the most important tournament of the year. Barring a monumental mess-up from Manchester United, Liverpool can no longer qualify for the Champions League next season. They missed their last realistic chance to finish in the English Premier League top four, after drawing 1-1 with Chelsea. A john Terry header put the Blues ahead, before captain Steven Gerrard equalised in his penultimate match. The Liverpool captain was given an ovation from Chelsea fans at Stamford Bridge, as a gesture of goodwill. It was a nice touch. You know, they have absolutely murdered me for years. Which is fair enough, it is part of the football banter, if you like. So it was a nice touch, but I am well aware, you know, it was only a moment. I have had great support from the Liverpool fans, that is all that really matters to me and I can’t thank them enough for all the support over the years. ~ Iamso I am so happy for that. Because the negative song the Chelsea fans sing to him isjust respect, it is respect for an old, dear enemy who fought so well against us in so many competitions, Champions League, FA Cup, fantastic, and after that the standing applause I think is amazing. To get it at Anfield, you get that week Wolfsburg have bolstered their forward line for the next Bundesliga They have made sure of a top-three finish with two matches to spare, after beating Paderborn 3-1. Timm Klose opened the scoring, heading in from Ricardo Rodriguez’s COI’I’IâIâ. Here is their second - a terrific switch to the right side, where Bas Dost was lurking on the post. And Dost got his double when he was in the right place to kick in a sloppy save from Lukas Kruse. So that is 16 goals in the league this season for the Dutchman. Manchester United-bound Memphis Depay is bidding farewell to the Eredivisie in style. He scored a stunning free kick as Dutch champions PSV Eindhoven beat Heracles 2-0. The 21-year-old received a great send-off from the PSV faithful, who will miss his goal-scoring ability when he moves to the English Premier League next season. And how about this for his 22nd league goal of the season. That is why Louis van Gaal had to act fast or lose him. Manchester United forked out a reported $35 million for the striker. Then there were two - Kevin Kisner and Rickie Fowlerare in a sudden-death play-off to win the Players Championship at Sawgrass. Both of them finished on 12-under after the final round. Sergio Garcia dropped out of a three-way play-off. The Spaniard missed birdie earlier on the 17th. Kisner went into a play-off. The other tee didn’t mess, so Kisner and Rickie Fowler went to sudden death and Rickie Fowler won his second PGA Tour title. The American players were voted the most overrated players by their peers in Sports Illustrated. Who is overrated now? Nico Rosberg won Formula One’s Spanish Grand Prix, with Lewis Hamilton completing another Mercedes one-two finish. Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel was third. So Hamilton’s lead has been cut to 20 points ahead of Rosberg in the championship. Nick Parrott reports. You will get short odds on Lewis Hamilton to retain his world title, at a worse that in Nico Rosberg’s favour for victory in Barcelona. 18 of the last 30 winners had started from pole and the German was destined to continue that trend. Usually Hamilton was slow off the mark and could only watch as his Mercedes team-mate surged away, and then Sebastian Vettel roared past. That forced him to change strategy and make an earlier pit stop. It wasn’t the smoothest but a brief delay did not hold Hamilton back. He eventually found himself in the lead after Vettel and Nico Rosberg made their final tyre change but the Britain still had one to make. It this time it went like clockwork. His margin of victory was greater than any Hamilton has enjoyed this season. Yes! It was a virtuoso performance that could see him conduct a comeback in the championship. It was the perfect weekend. Great to be on pole and to win the race like this. Very, very happy. Next to the team. The car all weekend has been perfect. So yes, really good. Italian Elia Viviani said it is incredible to win his first stage in the Giro d’Italia. It came down to the sprint finish in Genoa. Viviani got the better of Moreno Hofland and Andre Greipel on the line. Australia’s Michael Matthews finished just behind them, to take the race leader’s pinkjersey. A LeBronjames buzzer-beater won the game for the Cleveland Cavaliers against the Chicago Bulls. King james’s shot from the corner made it 86-84 to the Cavs. So it levels the Eastern Conference semi-final series at 2-2. Houston Rockets and LA Clippers play later on Sunday in their Western Conference semi. LA lead the series 2-1. ~ I wanted to get a good look. I faked like I was going to go for the low, bounced it into the left corner and just took a shot that I am very comfortable with taking. I was able to knock it down. -- lob. Like I said it was a huge win for our group. It means more thanjust a win for a young group. For us to come through, like tonight, it was huge. One of the greatest distance runners of alltime, Haile Gebrselassie, has retired from competitive running. But the Ethiopian will keep running for fun, because running is his life. Gebrselassie came 16th in the Great Manchester Run on Sunday. During his 25-year career, he claimed two Olympic gold medals, eight World Championship victories, and set 27 world records. See you soon, goodbye. Hello. It looks as though our week ahead will have something for everyone. If you want the quiet weather, we start our week like that, and it will be quite warm as well, with some sunny spells. However, if you are a gardener or a grower and you want more rain for the gardens, plenty of that by Thursday. We have some rain around at the moment stretching out of Scotland and Northern Ireland, that will be drifting south-east. A relatively mild start to Monday morning as well, temperatures widely into double figures. Our weather front continues to push south and east, weakening all the time but always an area of low pressure to the north-west keeps the winds a feature into Scotland and Northern Ireland, and it will bring with it further showers as the day continues. It will be a relatively quiet, bright start across Northern Ireland and Scotland. Some sunshine coming through. Showers should be fairly isolated first thing in the morning. The winds will continue to strengthen and the showers more of a feature into the afternoon. There is our weather front, then, just moving out of the Scottish Borders into the north of England and Wales. Still a little bit of rain still on it but conditions here will improve Behind it, sharp showers and stronger winds developing in the far north, some showers could be heavy and thundery. Still relatively warm, though, 15-18. Highest values are likely across the Midlands, eastern England and south-east England. 22 or 23 not out the question. The exception along the Channel coast where we keep the cloud. Into Tuesday, the most straightforward description for Tuesday, sunny spells and scattered showers, particularly first thing. Those showers should become fairly isolated in the afternoon, flaring up in the north-west, where the winds will remain a feature, highs of 11-19, so a bit fresher. Then as we move into Tuesday night with those clearer skies to Wednesday morning, things will turn a bit chilly, particularly in rural spots. Worth bearing in mind if you have put some tender plants in the garden, the potential for a frost. But Wednesday again will be bright with decent sunshine before the rain arrives on Thursday and some of it will turn heavy particularly into the south-east corner. That’s it. Enjoy your week. ~ Welcome to BBC News broadcasting at home and around the globe. I’m Daniela Ritorto. Our top stories: Commemorating the victory that freed Europe. Britain pays tribute to the generation that defeated Nazi Germany 70 years ago. Thousands flee as Typhoon Noul hits the northern Philippines.

Commemorations for the 70th anniversary of Victory in Europe at the end of the Second World War have culminated with a parade in London and a service of thanksgiving. The Queen led the congregation at Westminster Abbey, where the Archbishop of Canterbury spoke of victory over the greatest darkness of the 20th century. Hundreds of surviving veterans were involved in the parade, as Nicholas Witchell reports, on a day of remembrance. A day of national thanksgiving for a victory, receding a little into history now but undiminished in significance. Without this victory, there would have been no freedom. The commemoration was led within the ancient walls of Westminster Abbey by a monarch who remembers VE Day and knows only too well the scale of her generation’s sacrifice. The Queen placed her wreath at the grave of the Unknown Warrior. 70 years ago she appeared on VE Day on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with her father, King George VI, as the crowd celebrated victory in Europe. Today in Westminster Abbey, the Queen listened as words from her father’s VE Day speech giving thanks for Britain’s deliverance were recalled. Speaking from our empire’s oldest capital city, war battered but never... Never for one moment daunted or dismayed, speaking from London, I asked you tojoin with me in that act of thanksgiving. (LAST POST SOUNDS). 70 years after the war in Europe ended, a single guardsmen sounded the Last Post. At the west door of Westminster Abbey, the Queen met some of the veterans, members of a generation bonded by memories of when the United Kingdom and its allies stood against tyranny. And then, in the spring sunshine, the veterans marched, to the acclamation of the crowds, through Parliament Square and up Whitehall, pausing to pay their respects at the Cenotaph at those many friends who were lost. In the skies above, two Hurricaines and a Spitfire from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight adding their tribute to an indefatigable generation which has now grown old, but which 70 years ago would not be beaten. The German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, says relations between Russia and the West have suffered a serious setback because of the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Mrs Merkel had earlier attended a wreath-laying ceremony in Moscow to commemorate soldiers killed during World War II. She and other Western leaders declined invitations to a military parade in Red Square on Saturday. Sarah Rainsford reports from Moscow. A moment’s sombre reflection at the tomb of the unknown soldier. Angela Merkel came here to pay her respects to the millions of Soviet citizens killed in the war with Nazi Germany. A war in which Vladimir Putin’s own father fought. A war in which Vladimir Putin’s own fatherfought. But, like many Western leaders, the German Chancellor Shand Vladimir Putin’s victory Day parade. All of this was to mark 70 years since Hitler’s surrender but it was a display of modern-day military might, too, as Russia deploys troops in the Ukraine. Angela Merkel expressed her deep gratitude here in Moscow to those who paid such a high price in defeating Hitler, but in her position on the Ukraine she remains firm. She says the peace deal she helped to negotiate must be implemented, and the integrity of Ukraine must be restored. So current politics, not history, dominated this encounter, but there seemed to be little meeting of minds. Angela Merkel talks of returning Crimea to Ukraine. Vladimir Putin blames Kiev for violating the ceasefire and denies any Russian troops are involved. After their meeting, blood Amir Putin did pledge to get the rebels to endorse the peace deal, but behind him Angela Merkel ensured her message was strong. her message was slI’oI’Ig. TRANSLATION: her message was strong. TRANSLATION: The criminal annexation of Crimea, which is a violation of international order, and the military conflict in eastern UK have been a serious setback in our relations. -- Ukraine. We see it as violating the peaceful order of Europe. Today’s visit, though, took a lesson from history about the need to resolve conflicts through dialogue, however difficult. Germany’s leader admitted the peace deal for Ukraine may not succeed but she said it’s the only deal they’ve got. Typhoon Noul has crashed into the north of the Philippines with gusts of up to 220 kilometres per hour. The category five storm caused thousands of people to leave their homes fearing the threat of flash floods and landslides. The typhoon is now moving away from the Philippines towards Taiwan where nearly 1,000 tourists have been evacuated off the south-east coast. Ben Bland reports. This is what the Philippines have been bracing itself for. Typhoon Noul, said to be the strongest storm to hit the country so far this year. Winds of more than 220 kilometres an hour battered Cagayan province in the north-east. Ferries and flights were cancelled, leaving thousands of passengers stranded. There were fears of landslides and waves two metres high. Entire villages along the coast were evacuated, and people taken to higher ground. TRANSLATION: They came and told us to evacuate, because we are living on the coastline. The waves could destroy our homes. Forecasters expect the storm will weaken before moving towards on Tuesday. The very strongest winds concentrated around the edge of that eye. It was a near miss for other parts of the largest islands in the Philippines. Over the next couple of days, we will see the storm pushing northwards, pulled apart by strong upper-level winds, and the energy reduced as it moves over cold waters. It is likely to take heavy rain across central and southern parts ofjapan later on Monday and Wednesday into Tuesday. Electricity supplies were cut in parts of the Philippines. For many people now, an anxious wait. Not knowing when they can return home, and what they would find when they do. Ben Bland, BBC News. MY My guestjoins me on My guest joins me on the has passed the Philippines now, hasn’t it? right. So what’s the situation now? The situation now is that it passed over the Northern Ireland ‘s of the Philippines, and, when it passed, right now, we are still waiting for the reports from local government units on what the effects were of Typhoon Noul. -- Northern Islands. So far we haven’t had any major reports of casualties in those areas that were hit by Typhoon Noul. We heard, though, of one person who died because, as he was preparing his house while he was on the roof, there was electricity, and he died from electrocution. OK, so that one casualty that we know of so far. How severe was this typhoon compared with Typhoon Haiyan, which devastated the Philippines about 18 months ago? That’s right. It’s very severe. Infact it’s the strongest typhoon to hit the Philippines this year. There were winds of about 200 kilometres per hour, and it made landfall at the Northern tip. Forecasts were very low because of the imagery of that area, the depth of the water is there, and, although there were worrying research, it was significantly lower than the warnings that were made before Typhoon Haiyan made landfall. Before that time, the predicted storm surge heights were five or six metres. This time it was less than two metres. But we are still waiting for the reports coming from the provinces. Hopefully there is not much damage in the coastal area. And also the rainfall was not too heavy. It was moderate -heavy, and only in specific places near the eye of the storm. Thank you very much for speaking to us here. Let’s hope that those casualties stay very low, as you were saying. Thanks very much.

In Australia, a teenager is appearing in Melbourne’s Children’s Court charged over an alleged terror plot. The 17-year-old was arrested in a raid on Friday. Police will allege they found bombs at the boy’s home and that they’d prevented an imminent attack. Our correspondent Phil Mercer is in Sydney. What happened in that court hearing? Well, it was a very brief appearance by this 17-year-old boy. He was flanked by security guards. He didn’t apply for bail and has been remanded into custody, facing terrorism related offences, and the boy is due back in court in a few weeks’ time. He was arrested on Friday evening when heavily armed police officers raided a house in Melbourne’s northern suburbs, and we understand that the boy is the son of a respected doctor, and the police allege that they were thwarting an imminent threat to the community. And investigators say that, at that address, they found three improvised explosive devices that were made safe in a nearby park, so some very serious offences that this boy is being charged with, and, as we say, making a very brief appearance at a children’s Court in Melbourne. Obviously being a children’s Court, there are restrictions on reporting and identifying this boy. What are the chances of him, though, being tried as an adult? Well, that’s up to prosecutors and the courts. A senior police officer in Melbourne did say that there was scope within the legislation for the boy to appear in an adult’s court, but that of course is a decision to be made further down the track. Over the weekend we did hearfrom the down the track. Over the weekend we did hear from the Australian did hearfrom the Australian Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, talking about the broader security challenges for Australia, Mr Abbott saying that this country faced a very serious threat from home-grown extremism, and although Mr Abbott urged Australians to be vigilant, he did say that it was a very small number of people who were intent on doing Australia harm.

The latest headlines: Veterans of World War II have joined the Queen for a service of remembrance to mark the 70th anniversary of VE Day. A powerful typhoon has hit the north-east Philippines, forcing thousands to find shelter from flash floods and landslides. As if the people of Nepal haven’t had enough to deal with in the days after the earthquake, Mother Nature is again having a disastrous impact - with more landslides and avalanches in one of the worst-affected areas. The search and rescue effort in the devastated Langtang Valley is suspended because of the bad weather. Police in the area say at least 300 people are missing, and hundreds of others are desperate for help - and all aid workers can do is to wait the weather out. Well, in the capital, heritage and restoration experts are trying to figure out how to salvage the city’s damaged temples, some of them are hundreds of years old. But as Yogita Limaye explains, parts of Kathmandu culture may be lost forever. Towering over the Kathmandu Valley, one of Nepal’s most prominent landmarks. This temple is among one of the most revered religious sites in the country. Today, the main building is surrounded by a pile of rubble, where temples used to stand. Priests here have onlyjust begun morning prayers again. Their families have lived here for centuries. The earthquake destroyed their homes too. TRANSLATION: For us, this is like a mother and father. My parents told me that people who save money on their food and donate, that is the kind of devotion people have towards the temple. I cannot express what has been lost. But they are trying to save whatever remains of the ancient structures. Even as there are fears the whole complex may have been left unstable. They are still to check whether this golden tower faced structural damage, but right here, this area has to be completely rebuilt. The earthquake has taken away a big piece of Nepal’s heritage. Across the city of Kathmandu, some of the historical and religious sites have been worst affected. The terrifying moment captured by tourists in this square. Two temples, built 300 years ago, crumbled in a matter of seconds. Today, what would have been full of tourists is partly in ruins. The royal complex was famous for its intricate carvings and beautiful architecture. Some parts are lost. We need to phase it out in two years. You know, it is no use trying to do everything immediately. We need to make sure that it is done immediately, and as much of the material is safeguarded and structures are demolished just because they might have certain cracks. It is going to be a long road to recovery. The earthquake took with it so many of Nepal’s people, and also a part of Nepal’s soul. Cuban President Raul Castro has thanked Pope Francis for brokering the thaw between Havana and Washington. He said the Pope’s modesty and wisdom so impressed him that he might return to the Catholic Church, despite being a communist. David Willey reports from Rome. This was not a state visit. Simply along private chat in Spanish, without interpreters. It enabled Then there was an exchange of gifts. United States in September. He seems to have enchanted the Cuban leader, who like his brother Fidel Castro was baptised Catholic. Later, President Castro met the Italian Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi, who made it clear that he was deeply impressed by his talk with the first Pope of Latin America. TRANSLATION: If the Pope keeps on talking this way, sooner or later I’ll start praying again and I’ll return to the Catholic Church. And I’m not kidding, a Communist, and the Cuban Communist Party has never accepted religion. But now, by allowing it, we are taking a step forward. Relations between Havana in the Vatican have improved in recent years, after visits to Cuba both by late Pope john Paul and by Pope Emeritus Benedict. Many church activities were suppressed after the Communist revolution. But Raul Castro attended a gesture would run school in Cuba, and he joked that in a certain sense he felt he was a jesuit, just like the Pope. For Pope Francis, the brokering of restored relations between US and Cuba, conducted in secret from inside the Vatican last year, has been a major diplomatic triumph. A new Bollywood musical has launched in London, after a successful run in Mumbai. Beyond Bollywood is the brainchild of two of its most creative talents - director Rajeev Goswami and lyricist Irfan Siddiqui.

India is a loud country and we celebrate loudly. This show, it is like... I say it is a one-stop shop. I will make sure that you feel that you’re in India. Today we are at the Dance Attic Studio. And it is great. The moment we entered the studio we felt like, oh my god, this is for real. We are rehearsing today, we are doing a couple of songs and runthroughs. We are aiming for perfection everyday, so this is one of those days. I am playing the lead role of Shaily Shergill in the musical. I am actually playing this dancer who really wants to follow her mother’s footsteps and make it big, for her mother and for her legacy. I am playing Raghav’s character in the play. And he’s a folk dancer, but somehow things did not work out for him because dancing in India is not that respected or whatever. Then he meets Shaily and he takes her around and shows her what folk dancing and India is all about in the play. Our show is taking you through the cultures of India, so that, you know, you feel like you have travelled through India and feel part of the culture. It is such a big country, India, there are so many dance styles and so many regions. It was an eye opener for me and the audience who said, we are Indians but we don’t know these dance styles. When people in London come, trust me, they will take India back with them. The Indian instruments like tabla, sitar with some live classical dancing, it’s going to be fun. It’s a lot of dancing. It’s got a variety of... Like, when you go back after the show, you will go back with a part of India with you. It’s a dream come true. It’s a dream turned into reality. I hope everybody likes it.

Now on BBC News, all the latest business news live from Singapore. China’s Central Bank cuts interest rates again. Will it help to kickstart the country’s economy? As migrant workers flee fighting in Yemen, we look at the impact back home. Thanks forjoining us for this Monday edition of Asia Business Report here on the BBC. China has cut interest rates for the third time in six months, in a bid to rekindle the country’s economy which is heading for its lowest growth rate in nearly a quarter century. The People’s Bank of China lowered its one-year lending rate by 0.25%. Rates have slowed to its lowest growth for nearly 25 years. Will this new card has an impact? Earlier I spoke to the head of trading for Asia at Modeo. Hopefully, overtime, these cuts will have an impact. The focus is on growth and keeping it at 7%. They are struggling a little at the moment. Inflation is coming up, this is catching up with inflation, and as the market is expected, another cut here. More to come as well. More to come? Inflation is in the highest percent. How many more can we expect from the People’s Bank of China? Like in the US, it is dependent. As I say, the greatest number of 7% is important, but unlike other economies, other central banks, they aren’t so focused on weakening the currency, the kind of dismissed it for political reasons. This is a focus on growth. If you look at the world’s largest economy, Could we see the Chinese also I think they will fall, there will be more cuts. I don’t think we are hitting that territory. With a growth rate down at 6%, there should still be inflation pressures in the economy. Of course, official rates will catch up with inflation. We will have a stable environment, with a natural and real interest. Could this lead to other central banks in the region, to follow the lead of the Chinese, and cut interest rates again? You have the likes of Indonesia, South Korea, Australia, cutting rates over the last six months. Well, maybe, but let’s not forget a lot of these economies are dependent on the US, and they are going in the other direction. What we are discussing now is whether it is September, December, that is important. Already there is talk this morning. People forecasting New Zealand to go out over summer. It is interesting to see the direction of these economies at the moment. This Monday investors injapan, Australia and South Korea are cheering these developments with the Nick Hayes soaring by 263 points and the ASX All Ordinaries higher.

A five-day truce begins tomorrow in Yemen where Saudi lead rebels have killed at least 400 people in recent weeks. The conflict means migrant workers, many from India, are heading home, cutting off a major source of income for families back home. India received about $70 billion in remittances last year, more than anywhere else in the world, including China and more than double the amount of other countries like the Philippines, Mexico and Nigeria. Remittance comes from Indians working in places like Australia, Canada and the US. More than half the money is sent back from the Gulf states. A flight with a difference. Thousands of people, mainly Indian citizens, evacuate from Yemen last month, after the government there was ousted and violence spread across the country. This woman was one of them. Now she is back in her village in southern India. She had only moved to Yemen in September last year. Her nurse’s salary of $700 a month was three times the amount she was earning here. And the family she left back in India, including her parents, son and sister, were depending on her financially. Now, of course, she is worried. TRANSLATION: I borrowed money to get a visa to go to Yemen. I hope to improve my financial situation. Now I don’t have money to buy another visa to go abroad, I have to look for a job somewhere in India. It is a big relief to be out of Yemen, and back somewhere safer and more peaceful.

He had been living in the Gulf nation with his wife for about 20 years, working in a travel and tourism company. Now, the family is in limbo. Francis says he cannot imagine his future anywhere other than Yemen. He hopes he can return soon. I got everything from Yemen. I have nothing here. Yemen is my country, I hope it turns good. The people are good. Very nice people. They are very good people. So, I enjoy Yemen. I have good contacts, more in Yemen. For now, there is no clarity over when Yemen’s conflict will end, and when people like Francis can return. That means uncertainty for thousands of India’s migrant workers. Oil prices have been on a rollercoaster after hitting highs last week, now they have finished lower. The focus today will be on the China rate cut and the USjobs report, so what is the outlook? Earlier, I spoke to an oil expert. It’s just the environment of low interest rates that will continue to contribute to the storage of crude. One of the key elements in rebounding demand has been the lower price, but also the fact that this environment of low interest rates is encouraging people to store more crude. just to give you an example, according to Argos estimates, we believe that a large crude cargo that would cost you about $130 million would again cost you about $2 million to store over the course of the year, which is less than half of what it would have cost you back in 2009, when we had a very similar oversupply environment. So if there’s a storage of more crude, this will add to the global inventory is and bring prices down from their current levels? That really depends on whether that crude is actually being consumed as well. And what we see is a remarkable demand growth from Asian economies in terms of actual consumption. Gasoline consumption in South Korea of 9%. The same in the case of China, despite the slowing economic growth in that country, and in places like India as well, despite the removal of subsidies, we continue to see very strong demand for growth, across also south-east Asian economies. So it is that demand growth coupled with the ability of countries to put crude into storage that is providing support to prices. What about the OPEC? Are they contented with the current price levels? Do Saudi Arabia want to cut oil production to boost prices? Actually it’s quite the opposite. We are seeing Saudi Arabia producing at record levels, 10.3 million barrels per day, or 10.15, according to the most recent Aprilfigures. But this 10.15, according to the most recent April figures. But this strength in production isjust meant April figures. But this strength in production is just meant to production isjust meant to keep oversupply in the market, and to the degree that it’s possible, capping prices, so that actually you see more of the shale output coming off from the United States. We’ve already seen a stabilisation of US production, but with these high prices these producers have been able to hedge further into the future maintaining that output. That would go against OPEC strategy to decrease production, to reduce prices. Thank you so much for investing your time with us. Goodbye for now. The top stories this hour. Veterans of World War Two have joined the Queen for a service of remembrance to mark the 70th anniversary of VE Day. A powerful typhoon has hit the north-east Philippines, forcing thousands to find shelter from flash floods and landslides. It’s being reported that a man recently arrested after a woman’s parachute failed to open during a sky dive in Wiltshire is her husband. Victoria Cilliers, seen here with her husband Emile, suffered multiple injuries when both her main and reserve parachutes malfunctioned during a solojump on Salisbury Plain. It’s now emerged that her husband, who is an instructor, was questioned by police after they were alerted to the possibility that the parachutes were sabotaged. Respect leader George Galloway says he has begun legal proceedings to challenge his election defeat in Bradford West. Mr Galloway lost his seat to the Labour candidate, Naz Shah. In a statement, the Labour Party said ""George Galloway should accept he was booted out by the people of Bradford West’. Naz Shah won with a majority of more than 11,000. It’s been a key evening in the British showbusiness calendar with the BAFTA television awards taking place in London. The awards celebrated performances in front of the camera and the very best behind-the-scenes talent. Our entertainment correspondent Lizo Mzimba was on the red carpet. Some of the biggest stars of the small screen were out on the red carpet, for a night honouring the very best TV. Tonight isn’t necessarily about which shows or performers are the most popular. It is about which are judged to be of the highest quality by the industry, and such recognition from their peers is of huge importance to the nominees, and particularly to the winners. Anything that I have said, I have said to the police... The Lost Honour of Christopher jefferies, the true story of how a retired teacher became engulfed in a news frenzy, after being arrested for a murder he hadn’t committed, won two awards - Best Miniseries and Best Actor, forjason Watkins. It is a brilliant script and it’s about real events and real people, and things that happened that are relevant. And it tells a story beyond just a thrilling tale, or a particular genre, it tells of real events. Also winning two awards - Marvellous, another true story, about the extraordinary life of a man called Neil Baldwin. It won Best Single Drama and Best Supporting Actress for Gemma jones. jessica Hynes won her first BAFTA, taking Best Female Comedy Performance for her role in BBC satire W1A. received a special award recognising Don’t forget to catch up with all of us here on Twitter: Hello, I’m Nick Marshall-McCormack, and this is Sport Today from the BBC Sport Centre. Coming up: Andy Murray says his marriage has helped him do the business. The Scot wins the Madrid Masters. Rickie Fowler wins the Players Championship, after a dramatic play-off at Sawgrass. And walking in Memphis - this is why Manchester United spent big on Memphis Depay. Hi there. Wherever you are around the world, welcome to Sport Today. Andy Murray has a message for all you guys and girls out there wondering whether to tie the knot. The British number one tennis star claims marriage works, after winning the Madrid Open by beating Rafael Nadal. The Spaniard will drop to world number seven now, putting him outside the top five for the first time in a decade. And that could give him a tougher draw at the French Open. Rafael Nadal’s kingdom is built on clay. So, on his home surface, in his home country, his authority is absolute. Six times Andy Murray has played him on clay, six times he has lost. And yet, Murray looked dominant in the first set, taking it 6-3. The world number three played on Spanish clay as a teenager, training in Barcelona. But this is the surface that Nadal normally excels on, and at the start of the second set, it saw him back on form. But not for long. This simply doesn’t happen to Nadal, who has won the tournament four times. He was swept away in straight sets. Since his wedding last month, Murray’s form has surged. Traditionally he has struggled on clay. What has changed? Well, in his own words, ""marriage works"". I wasn’t expecting this a couple of weeks ago. So, you know, when things are unexpected, it tends to... You know, it feels nicer. I didn’t have - I didn’t feel like I put too much pressure on myself in the last couple of weeks, which is a good thing. But yes, obviously to win a Masters series on clay is a step in the right direction. It is something I have never done before, so that is good progress there. And yeah, obviously to win against Rafa on clay in a final in Spain is an extremely difficult thing to do, and I am proud that I have managed to do that. Andy is playing well, and you cannot pretend to win against a player like Andy playing the way I played today. That’s it, that simple. I accept that, I accept that today was not the right day, for me. And I congratulate Andy because he is playing great, winning last week in Munich, and I think the first time in his career on clay. He is playing well in the most important tournament of the year. Barring a monumental mess-up from Manchester United, Liverpool can no longer qualify for the Champions League next season. They missed their last realistic chance to finish in the English Premier League top four after drawing 1-1 with Chelsea. A john Terry header put the Blues ahead, before captain Steven Gerrard equalised in his penultimate match. The Liverpool Captain was given an ovation from Chelsea fans at Stamford Bridge as a gesture of goodwill. Yeah, it was a nice touch. You know, they have absolutely murdered me for years. Which is fair enough, it is part of the football banter, if you like. So it was a nice touch, but I’m well aware, you know, it was only a moment. I’ve had great support from the Liverpool fans, that is all that really matters to me. And I can’t thank them enough for all the support over the years. I am so happy with that, because the negative song the Chelsea fans sing to him is just respect, it is respect for an old, dear enemy, that fought so much against us in so many competitions. Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup - fantastic, and after that the standing applause I think is amazing. To get it at Anfield, you get that week in, week out, year after year, but away, at home - I think shows a lot. So I’m happy for him, and I’m happy for my people at Stamford Bridge. Wolfsburg have bolstered their forward line for the next Bundesliga season by signing Max Kruse, from Borussia Moenchengladbach, on a four-year contract. And what a Sunday for the Wolves, because they have also secured a spot in the Champions League next season. ~ I think we played very well. As I said before, it is not only important to win, that is the most important thing. Also scoring the most amount of goals and continue with our philosophy and our style of football. Wolfsburg have bolstered their forward line for the next Bundesliga season by signing Max Kruse, from Borussia Moenchengladbach, on a four-year contract. And what a Sunday for the Wolves, because they have also secured a spot in the Champions League next season. They have made sure of a top-three finish with two matches to spare, after beating Paderborn 3-1. Timm Klose opened the scoring, heading in from Ricardo Rodriguez’s COI’I’IEIâ. Here is their second - a terrific switch to the right side, where Bas Dost was lurking on the post. And Dost got his double, when he was in the right place to kick in a sloppy save from Lukas Kruse. So that is 16 goals in the League this season for the Dutchman. The 19th league goal for the Serie A season, held his team to a 2-2 draw. Two goal lead was allowed to slip for Cesena. Naples have failed a little bit in their quest for Champions League football. They didn’t get all the points against the bottom of the table Parma. Atletico Madrid have a four point buffer between them and 4th place in Spain’s Gomera division. -- Primera division. Manchester United-bound Memphis Depay is bidding farewell to the Eredivisie in style. He scored a stunning free kick, as Dutch champions PSV Eindhoven beat Heracles 2-0. The 21-year-old received a great send-off from the PSV faithful, who will miss his goal-scoring ability when he moves to the English Premier League next season. And how about this for his 22nd League goal of the season. That is why Louis van Gaal had to act fast, or lose him. Manchester United forked out a reported $35 million for the striker. Days after being labelled overrated by his fellow players, Rickie Fowler produced the perfect response, by winning the Players Championship in sensational style on Sunday. Kevin Kisner could have won the tournament on the 18th with a birdie. But he missed, so he went into a three-way playoff against Fowler and Sergio Garcia. Garcia dropped out after missing a birdie on the second playoff hole, while the other two didn’t. So Kisner and Fowler went to sudden death, and Fowler won his second PGA Tour title. The American and Ian Poulter were voted the most overrated players by their peers, in an anonymous survey conducted by Sports Illustrated. Nico Rosberg won Formula One’s Spanish Grand Prix, with Lewis Hamilton completing another Mercedes one-two finish. Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel was third. So Hamilton’s lead has been cut to 20 points ahead of Rosberg in the championship. Nick Parrott reports. Italian Elia Viviani said it is incredible to win his first stage in the Giro d’Italia. It came down to the sprint finish in Genoa. Viviani got the better of Moreno Hofland and Andre Greipel on the line. Australia’s Michael Matthews finished just behind them, to take the race leader’s pinkjersey. A LeBronjames buzzer-beater won the game for the Cleveland Cavaliers against the Chicago Bulls. King james’s shot from the corner made it 86-84 to the Cavs. So it levels the Eastern Conference semi-final series at 2-2. One of the greatest distance runners of all-time, Haile Gebrselassie, has retired from competitive running. But the Ethiopian will keep running for fun, because running is his life. Gebrselassie came 16th in the Great Manchester Run on Sunday. During his 25-year career, he claimed two Olympic gold medals, eight World Championship victories, and set 27 world records.

See you soon, goodbye. Hello there. It looks as though our week ahead will have something for everyone. If you want the quiet weather, we start our week like that, and it will be quite warm as well, with some sunny spells. However, if you are a gardener or a grower and you want further rain for the gardens, well, there will be plenty of that by Thursday. We have got some rain around at the moment, stretching out of Scotland and Northern Ireland, and that will be drifting south-east. It will be a relatively mild start to Monday morning as well, temperatures widely into double figures. Our weather front continues to push south and east, weakening all the time, but always an area of low pressure to the north-west keeps the winds a feature into Scotland and Northern Ireland, and it will bring with it further showers as the day continues. But it will be a relatively quiet, bright start across Northern Ireland and Scotland. Some sunshine coming through. Showers should be fairly isolated first thing in the morning. The winds will continue to strengthen, and the showers more of a feature into the afternoon. The odd spot or two of rain into the south-west too. a pleasant enough start to the day. Now as the day continues, our weather front sinks south and east, weakening. just a band of cloud as it pushes into the Midlands, turning the sunshine somewhat hazy, and maybe along the south coast we could see a little bit of mist clinging here. Behind it, sharp showers and stronger winds developing in the far north, some of those showers heavy and possibly thundery. But it will still be relatively warm, though, 15-18. Highest values are likely across the Midlands, eastern England and south-east England. 22,23 degrees not out the question. The exception perhaps along the Channel coast where we keep that cloud here. Now as we go into Tuesday, the most straightforward description for Tuesday, sunny spells and scattered showers, particularly first thing in the morning. Those showers should become fairly isolated in the afternoon, flaring up into the north-west, where the winds will remain a feature, highs of 11-19, so just that little bit fresher. Then as we move through Tuesday night with those clearer skies into Wednesday morning, things will turn a bit chilly, particularly in rural spots. And certainly worth bearing in mind if you have put some tender plants in the garden, there is the potential for a frost. But Wednesday again will be bright with decent sunshine before the rain arrives on Thursday and some of it will turn quite heavy, particularly into the south-east corner. That’s it. Enjoy your week. Welcome to BBC News broadcasting at home and around the globe. I’m Daniela Ritorto. Our top stories: Commemorating the victory that freed Europe. Britain pays tribute to the generation that defeated Nazi Germany 70 years ago. Thousands flee as Typhoon Noul hits the northern Philippines. The strongest storm of the year threatens to bring flash floods and landslides. And the long road to rebuild Nepal’s heritage. Hopes and prayers in a country devastated by the earthquake. Papal Attraction: Cuba’s President Raul Castro says he’s Commemorations for the 70th anniversary of Victory in Europe at the end of the Second World War have culminated with a parade in London and a service of thanksgiving. The Queen led the congregation at Westminster Abbey, where the Archbishop of Canterbury spoke of victory over the greatest darkness of the 20th century. Hundreds of surviving veterans were involved in the parade, as Nicholas Witchell reports, on a day of remembrance. A day of national thanksgiving for a victory, receding a little into history now but undiminished in significance. Without this victory, there would have been no freedom. The commemoration was led within the ancient walls of Westminster Abbey by a monarch who remembers VE Day and knows only too well the scale of her generation’s sacrifice. The Queen placed her wreath at the grave of the Unknown Warrior. 70 years ago she appeared on VE Day on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with her father, King George VI, as the crowd celebrated victory in Europe. Today in Westminster Abbey, the Queen listened as words from her father’s VE Day speech giving thanks for Britain’s deliverance were recalled. Speaking from our empire’s oldest capital city, war battered but never... Never for one moment daunted or dismayed, speaking from London, I ask you to join with me in that act of thanksgiving. (LAST POST SOUNDS). of when the United Kingdom and its allies stood against tyranny. And then, in the spring sunshine, the veterans marched, to the acclamation of the crowds, through Parliament Square and up Whitehall, pausing to pay their respects at the Cenotaph at those many friends who were lost. In the skies above, two Hurricanes and a Spitfire from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight adding their tribute to an indefatigable generation which has now grown old, but which 70 years ago would not be beaten. The German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, says relations between Russia and the West have suffered a serious setback because of the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Mrs Merkel had earlier attended a wreath-laying ceremony in Moscow to commemorate soldiers killed during World War II. She and other Western leaders declined invitations to a military parade in Red Square on Saturday. Sarah Rainsford reports from Moscow. A moment’s sombre reflection at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Angela Merkel came here to pay her respects to the millions of Soviet citizens killed in the war with Nazi Germany. A war in which Vladimir Putin’s own father fought. But, like many Western leaders, the German Chancellor shunned Putin’s Victory Day parade. All this was to mark 70 years since Hitler’s surrender, but it was a display of modern-day military might too, as Russia deploys troops in the Ukraine. Angela Merkel expressed her deep gratitude here in Moscow to those who paid such a high price in defeating Hitler, but in her position on the Ukraine she remains firm. She says the deal she helped to negotiate must be implemented, and the integrity of Ukraine must be restored. So current politics, not history, dominated this encounter, but there seemed to be little meeting of minds. Angela Merkel talks of returning Crimea to Ukraine. Vladimir Putin blames Kiev for violating the ceasefire and denies any Russian troops are involved. After their meeting, Mr Putin did pledge to get the rebels to enforse the peace deal, but behind him Angela Merkel EI’ISUIâEd i’IEIâ ITIESSBQE WGS StI’oI’Ig. TRANSLATION: The criminal annexation of Crimea, which is a violation of international order, and the military conflict in eastern Ukraine have been a serious setback in our relations. We see it as violating the peaceful order of Europe. Today’s visit, though, took a lesson from history about the need to resolve conflicts through dialogue, however difficult. Germany’s leader admitted the peace deal for Ukraine may not succeed but she said it’s the only deal they’ve got. Typhoon Noul has crashed into the north of the Philippines with gusts of up to 220 kilometres per hour. The category five storm caused thousands of people to leave their homes fearing the threat of flash floods and landslides. The typhoon is now moving away from the Philippines towards Taiwan where nearly 1,000 tourists have been evacuated off the south-east coast. Ben Bland reports. This is what the Philippines have been bracing itself for. Typhoon Noul, said to be the strongest storm to hit the country so far this year. Winds of more than 220 kilometres an hour battered Cagayan province in the north-east. Ferries and flights were cancelled, leaving thousands of passengers stranded. There were fears of landslides and waves two metres high. Entire villages along the coast were evacuated, and people taken to higher ground. TRANSLATION: They came and told us to evacuate, because we are living on the coastline. The waves could destroy our homes. Forecasters expect the storm will weaken before moving towards on Tuesday. The very strongest winds concentrated around the edge of that eye. It was a near miss for other parts of the largest islands in the Philippines. Over the next couple of days, we will see the storm pushing northwards, pulled apart by strong upper-level winds, and the energy reduced as it moves over cold waters. It is likely to take heavy rain across central and southern parts ofjapan later on Monday and Wednesday into Tuesday. Electricity supplies were cut in parts of the Philippines. For many people now, an anxious wait. Not knowing when they can return home, and what they would find when they do. Ben Bland, BBC News. A short while ago, I spoke to Dr Mahar Lagmay. The director of the Philippine Nationwide Operational Assessment of Hazards in Manila. And asked his opinion of the situation in the Philippines now. The situation now is that it passed over the Northern islands of the Philippines, and, when it passed, right now, So far we haven’t had any major reports of casualties in those areas We heard, though, of one person who died because, as he was preparing his house while he was on the roof, there was electricity, and he died from electrocution. OK, so that one casualty that we know of so far. How severe was this typhoon compared with Haiyan, which devastated the Philippines about 18 months ago? That’s right. It’s very severe. Infact it’s the strongest typhoon to hit the Philippines this year. There were winds of about 200 kilometres per hour, and it made landfall at the northern tip. Simulations were very low because of the imagery of that area, the depth of the water is there, and, although there were worrying research, it was significantly lower than the warnings that were made before Haiyan made la ndfall. During that time, the predicted storm surge heights were five or six metres. This time it was less than two metres. But we are still waiting for the reports coming from the provinces. Hopefully there is not much damage in the coastal area. And also the rainfall was not too heavy. It was moderate to heavy, and only in specific places near the eye of the storm. In other news: The president of Macedonia has accused a group of gunmen involved in deadly clashes with police of planning to carry out terror attacks. The Macedonian authorities say they found a huge arsenal of weapons belonging to the group of more than 40 men. They identified several of their leaders as ethnic Albanians from Kosovo. More than 20 people were killed in the violence. A Moroccan F16 warplane taking part in the coalition fighting in Yemen has gone missing. According to a statement, one of the aircraft using the bombing campaign against the Houthi rebels went missing. A second pilot said he could not see if the pilot had ejected from the jet. The South African government has warned that rhinoceros poaching is reaching record levels. The country’s environment minister said 393 rhinos had been killed so far this year.

In Australia, a teenager is appearing in Melbourne’s Children’s Court charged over an alleged terror plot. The 17-year-old was arrested in a raid on Friday. Police will allege they found bombs at the boy’s home and that they’d prevented an imminent attack. Our correspondent Phil Mercer is in Sydney. Well, it was a very brief appearance by this 17-year-old boy. He was flanked by security guards. He didn’t apply for bail and has been remanded into custody, facing terrorism related offences, and the boy is due back in court in a few weeks’ time. He was arrested on Friday evening when heavily armed police officers raided a house in Melbourne’s northern suburbs, and we understand that the boy is the son of a respected doctor, and the allege that they were thwarting an imminent threat to the community. And investigators say that, at that address, they found three improvised explosive devices that were made safe in a nearby park, so some very serious offences that this boy is being charged with, and, as we say, making a very brief appearance at a children’s Court in Melbourne. Obviously being a Children’s Court, there are restrictions on reporting and identifying this boy. What are the chances of him, though, being tried as an adult? Well, that’s up to prosecutors and the courts. A senior police officer in Melbourne did say that there was scope within the legislation for the boy to appear in an adults’ court, but that of course is a decision to be made further down the track. Over the weekend we did hear from the Australian Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, talking about the broader security challenges for Australia, Mr Abbott saying that this country faced a very serious threat from home-grown extremism, and although Mr Abbott urged Australians to be vigilant, he did say that it was a very small number of people who were intent on doing Australia harm. Worth noting, too, that, in September of last year, the government here raised the domestic security threat level from medium to high for the first time. Stay with us on BBC News. Still to come: Beyond Bollywood - we take you behind the scenes of a show that aims to bring the many cultures of India to a stage near you. Let’s round up the stories making headlines in the newspapers around the world. The Times leads with the European Union’s plans to force Britain to take in tens of thousands of refugees pulled from the Mediterranean. The paper says it is the first test of David Cameron’s new government. The Wall Street journal quotes a senior official who claims China’s central bank has slashed That is in South China Morning Post. China Daily has comments from formerjapanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, who says japan should apologise again for its wartime behaviour, to ensure history doesn’t repeat itself. Apologies there the papers. -- apologies therefore the papers. This is BBC News. The latest headlines: Veterans of World War II have joined the Queen for a service of remembrance to mark the 70th anniversary of VE Day. A powerful typhoon has hit the north-east Philippines, forcing thousands to find shelter from flash floods and landslides. As if the people of Nepal haven’t had enough to deal with in the days after the earthquake, Mother Nature is again having a disastrous impact, with more landslides and avalanches in one of the worst-affected areas. The search and rescue effort in the devastated Langtang Valley is suspended because of the bad weather. Police in the area say at least 300 people are missing, and hundreds of others are desperate for help - and all aid workers can do is to wait the weather out. Well, in the capital, heritage and restoration experts are trying to figure out how to salvage the city’s damaged temples. Some of them are hundreds of years old. But as Yogita Limaye explains, parts of Kathmandu culture may be lost forever. Towering over the Kathmandu Valley, one of Nepal’s most prominent landmarks. This temple is among one of the most revered religious sites in the country. Today, the main building is surrounded by a pile of rubble, where temples used to stand. Priests here have onlyjust begun morning prayers again. Their families have lived here for centuries. The earthquake destroyed their homes too. TRANSLATION: For us, this is like a mother and father. My parents told me that people would save money on their food and donate it to get it built. That is the kind of devotion people have towards the temple. I cannot express in words what has been lost. But they are trying to save whatever remains of the ancient structures, even as there are fears the whole complex may have been left unstable. They are still to check whether this golden tower faced structural damage, but right here, this area has to be completely rebuilt. The earthquake has taken away a big piece of Nepal’s heritage. Across the city of Kathmandu, some of the historical and religious sites have been worst affected. The terrifying moment captured by tourists in this square. Two temples, built 300 years ago, crumbled in a matter of seconds. Today, what would have been full of tourists is partly in ruins. The royal complex was famous for its intricate carvings and beautiful architecture. Some parts are lost. We need to phase it out in two years. You know, it is no use trying to do everything immediately. What we have to make sure is done immediately, is make sure much of the material is safeguarded, and structures aren’t demolished just because they might have certain cracks. It is going to be a long road to recovery. The earthquake took with it so many of Nepal’s people, and also a part of Nepal’s soul. Extreme weather conditions across the central US have left parts of Texas flooded. The National Guard was brought in to aid workers as flash floods trapped people in their cars and homes. Tornadoes ripped through the north of the state yesterday followed by the heavy rainfall. This severe weather followed into the Central Plains, destroying houses and injuring nine people in South Dakota as well. Cuban President Raul Castro has thanked Pope Francis for brokering the thaw between Havana and Washington. He said the Pope’s modesty and wisdom so impressed him that he might return to the Catholic Church, despite being a communist. David Willey reports from Rome. This was not a state visit. Simply a long, private chat in Spanish, without interpreters. It enabled Raul Castro to thank Pope Francis in person for his role in breaking more than half a century of antagonism between Cuba and the United States. Then there was an exchange of gifts. Pope Francis will spend two days in Cuba, on his way to the United States in September. He seems to have enchanted the Cuban leader who, like his brother Fidel Castro, was baptised Catholic. Later, President Castro met the Italian Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi, who made it clear that he was deeply impressed by his talk with the first Pope of Latin America. TRANSLATION: If the Pope keeps on talking this way, sooner or later I’ll start praying again, and I’ll return to the Catholic Church. Party has never accepted religion. Relations between Havana in the Vatican have improved in recent years, after visits to Cuba both by late Pope john Paul and by Pope Emeritus Benedict. Many church activities were suppressed after the Communist revolution. But Raul Castro attended a jesuit-run school in Cuba, and he joked that in a certain sense he felt he was a jesuit, just like the Pope. For Pope Francis, the brokering of the restoration of relations between the US and Cuba, conducted in secret inside the Vatican last year, has been a major diplomatic triumph. A new Bollywood musical has launched in London, after a successful run in Mumbai. Beyond Bollywood is the brainchild of two of its most creative talents - director Rajeev Goswami and lyricist Irfan Siddiqui. It is billed as an explosion of colour and movement, with dance and drama. So where better to stage it than the historic London Palladium? BBC News got a sneak preview of what to expect. India is a loud country, and we celebrate loud, you know. This show, it is like... I say it is a one-stop shop. I will make sure that you feel that you’re in India. Today we are at the Dance Attic Studio. And it is great. The moment we entered the studio we felt like, oh my god, this is for real. We are rehearsing today, we are doing a couple of songs and runthroughs. We are aiming for perfection every day, so this is one of those days. I am playing the lead role of Shaily Shergill in the musical. I am actually playing this dancer who really wants to follow her mother’s footsteps and make it big, for her mother and for her legacy. I am playing Raghav’s character in the play. And he’s a folk dancer, but somehow things did not work out for him because dancing in India is not that respected, or whatever. So then he meets Shaily and he takes her around India and shows her what folk dancing and India is all about in the play. Our show is taking you through the cultures of India, so that, you know, you have travelled through India, and you feel like you are part of the the journey. It is such a big country, India, there are so many dance styles and so many regions. It was an eye opener for me and the audience who said, we are Indians but we don’t know these dance styles. So trust me, When people in London come, they will take India back with them. The Indian instruments like tabla, sitar with some live classical dancing, it’s going to be fun. It’s a lot of dancing. It’s got a variety of... Like, when you go back after the show, you will go back with a part of India with you. It’s a dream come true. It’s a dream turned into reality. I hope everybody likes it. Prince Harry is continuing his tour of New Zealand. He has arrived in Invercargill, where he was greeted by dozens of screaming girls and a 100-year-old reptile.

Those showers should become fairly isolated into the afternoon, staying up into the north-west, where the winds will remain a feature, highs of 11-19, so just that little bit fresher. Then as we move through Tuesday night with those clearer skies into Wednesday morning, things will turn a little chilly, particularly in rural spots. And certainly worth bearing in mind if you have put some tender plants into the garden, there is the potential for a frost. But Wednesday again will be bright with decent sunshine before the rain arrives on Thursday and some of it will turn quite heavy, particularly into the south-east corner. That’s it, enjoy your week. ~ The latest headlines from BBC News. Queen Elizabeth and hundreds of war veterans have attended a service of thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey to mark the 70th anniversary of VE Day. The Queen laid a wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier at Westminster Abbey before The Red Arrows provided the finale for the three days of commemorations.

Now on BBC News all the latest business news live from Singapore. China’s Central Bank cuts interest rates again, will it help to kickstart the country’s economy? As migrant workers flee fighting in Yemen, we look at the impact back home. Thanks forjoining us for this Monday edition of Asia Business Report here on the BBC. China has cut interest rates for the third time in six months, in a bid to rekindle the country’s economy which is heading for its lowest growth rate in nearly a quarter of a century. The People’s Bank of China lowered its one-year lending rate by .25%. To 5.1%. Would it have an impact? Earlier, I spoke to the head of trading for Asia. Hopefully, overtime, these cuts will have an impact. The focus is on growth and keeping it at 7%. They are struggling a little at the moment. Inflation is coming up, this is catching up with inflation, and as the market is expected, another cut here. More to come as well. More to come? Inflation is in the highest percent. How many more can we expect from the People’s Bank of China? Like in the US, it is dependent. As I say, the growth number of 7% is important, but like other economies, other central banks, they aren’t so focused on weakening the currency, they kind of dismissed it for political reasons. This is a focus on growth. If you look at the world’s largest economy, the US, and the third-largest economy, japan, interest rates are virtually close to zero. Could we see the Chinese also heading in that direction, if growth continues to slow down? The IMF says we could see it at 6% by 2017? I think rates will fall, there will be more cuts. With a growth rate down at 6%, there should still be inflation We will have a stable environment, with a natural and real interest. Could this lead to other central banks in the region, to follow the lead of the Chinese, and cut interest rates again? You have the likes of Indonesia, South Korea, Australia, cutting rates of the last six months? Well, maybe, but let’s not forget a lot of these economies are dependent on the US, and they are going in the other direction. What we are discussing now is whether it is September, December, that is important. Already there is talk this morning. People forecasting the RBNZ in New Zealand to go out over summer. It is interesting to see the direction of these economies at the moment. Letters look at the markets. -- letters. -- let’s have a look at the markets. Chinese President Xi jinping is on a three-day trip to Belarus where he is expected to sign a $15.7 billion deal. China has already agreed to a five-year memorandum, and extended loans totalling $1 billion to Belarus banks. A five-day truce begins tomorrow in Yemen where Saudi lead rebels have killed at least 1400 people in recent weeks. The conflict means migrant workers, many from India, are heading home, cutting off a major source of income for families back home. India received about $70 billion in remittances last year, more than anywhere else in the world, including China and more than double the amount of other countries like the Philippines, Mexico and Nigeria. Remittance comes from Indians working in places like Australia, Canada and the US. More than half the money is sent back from the Gulf states. A flight with a difference. Thousands of people, mainly Indian citizens, evacuate from Yemen last month, after the government there was ousted and violence spread across the country. This woman was one of them. Now she is back in her village in southern India. She had only moved to Yemen in September last year. Her nurses salary of $700 a month was three times the amount she was earning here. And, the family she left back in India, including her parents, son and sister, were depending on her financially. Now, of course, she is worried. TRANSLATION: I borrowed money to get a Visa to go to Yemen. I hope to improve my financial situation. Now I don’t have money to buy another Visa to go abroad, I have to look for a job somewhere in India. It is a big relief to be out of Yemen, and the back somewhere safer and more peaceful. -- to be back. But it has also left those rescued with an uncertain future. They went to Yemen to earn more money. Often because they have struggled to find work back at home, OI’ to £8I’I’I ‘f8I’ ITIOI’E. The question for many is, what next? And, the answer, for some, is to return as soon as it is safe to do so. Living in another country. .. Francis Xavier is one of them. He had been living in the Gulf nation with his wife for about 20 years, working in a travel and tourism company. Now, the family is in limbo. Francis says he cannot imagine his future anywhere other than Yemen. He hopes he can return soon. I got everything from Yemen. I have nothing here. Yemen is my country, I hope it turns good. The people are good. Very nice people. They are very good people. So, I enjoy Yemen. I have good contacts, more in Yemen. For now, there is no clarity over when Yemen’s conflict will end, and when people like Francis can return. That means uncertainty for thousands of India’s migrant workers. Oil prices have been on a rollercoaster ride lately after hitting highs last week, and now they have finished lower. This is how they are trading. The focus today will be on the China rate cut and the USjobs report, what is the outlook? Earlier, I spoke to an oil expert. It is the environment of low interest rates that will continue to contribute to the storage of crude oil. One of the key elements in rebounding demand has been the lower prices. And also this environment of low interest rates is encouraging people to store more crude oil, to give you an example, according to Argus estimates, we believe that a large crude cargo would cost you $130 million. It would again cost you about $2 million to store over the course of the year. That is less than half of what it would cost you back in 2009, when we had a very similar oversupply environment. inventories, and bring prices down from their current levels? That really depends on whether We see remarkable demand growth in Asian consumption, in South Korea gas is up in 9%, in China it is the same, despite slowing economic growth in that country. In places like India as well, despite the removal of subsidies, we continue to see strong demand for growth across south-east Asian economies as well. So, it is that demand growth, coupled with the ability of countries to put it into storage, that is providing support to prices. What about the OPEC? Are they content with the current price levels? Does Saudi Arabia want to cut oil production to boost prices? Actually, it’s the opposite. Now we see that Saudi Arabia is producing record levels, 10.3 million barrels daily. Or 10.15, just according to most recent April figures. This strengthening production is meant to keep oversupply in the market, and to the degree that it is possible capping prices, so that you see more of the shale output coming from the US. We have already seen stabilisation of US production, but with these higher prices, some producers have been able to hedge. And hedge out further into the future. They might be able to maintain that output. That would go against OPEC’s strategy of increasing production to reduce prices. Before we leave, let’s have a quick look at the markets... A positive day so far in Asia. The China rate cut, and more US jobs, they have boosted market sentiment in mid-morning trade. It is the second interest rate reduction in six months, the third since last year. Those are the markets at this hour, thank you for investing your time with us on Asia Business Report. SEE yOU I’IEXl i’IOUI’. Welcome back to London. The top stories: veterans of the Second World War have joined the Queen for a service of remembrance to mark the 70th anniversary of VE Day. A powerful typhoon has hit the north-east of the Philippines, forcing thousands of people to find shelter from flash flooding and landslides. It’s being reported that a man recently arrested after a woman’s parachute failed to open during a sky dive in Wiltshire is her husband. Victoria Cilliers, seen here with her husband Emile, suffered multiple injuries when both her main and reserve parachutes malfunctioned during a solojump on Salisbury Plain.

Some of the biggest stars of the small screen were out on the red carpet, for a night honouring the very best TV. Tonight isn’t necessarily about which shows or performers are the most popular. It is about which are judged to be of the highest quality by the industry, and such recognition from their peers is of huge importance to the nominees, and particularly to the winners.

I’m Nick Marshall-McCormack and this is Sport Today Coming up: of his brain to win the Madrid Masters. Rickie Fowler wins the Players Championship after a dramatic play-off at Sawgrass. And walking in Memphis, this is why Manchester United spent big on Memphis Depay. Hi there. Wherever you are around the world, welcome to Sport Today. Andy Murray has a message for all you guys and girls out there wondering whether to tie the knot. The British number one tennis star claims marriage works, after winning the Madrid Open by beating Rafael Nadal. The Spaniard will drop to world number seven now, putting him outside the top five for the first time in a decade. And that could give him a tougher draw at the French Open. Rafael Nadal’s kingdom is built on clay. So, on his home surface, in his home country, his authority is absolute. Six times Andy Murray has played him on clay, and six times he has lost. And yet, Murray looked dominant in the first set, taking it 6-3. The world number three played on Spanish clay as a teenager, training in Barcelona. But this is the surface that Nadal normally excels on, and at the start of the second set, it saw him back on form. But not for long. This simply doesn’t happen to Nadal, who has won the tournament four times. He was swept away in straight sets. Since his wedding last month, Murray’s form has surged. Traditionally he has struggled on clay. What has changed? Well, in his own words, ""marriage works"". I wasn’t expecting this a couple of weeks ago. So, you know, when things are unexpected, it tends to... You know, it feels nicer. I didn’t have... I didn’t feel like I put too much pressure on myself in the last couple of weeks, which is a good thing. But yeah, I mean, obviously to win a Masters series on clay is a step in the right direction. It is something I have never done before, so that is good progress there. And yeah, obviously to win against Rafa on clay in a final in Spain is an extremely difficult thing to do, and I am proud that I have managed to do that. Andy is playing well, and you cannot pretend to win against a player like Andy playing the way I played today. That’s it, that simple. I accept that, I accept that today was not the right day, for me. And I congratulate Andy because he is playing great, winning last week in Munich, and I think the first time in his career on clay. He is playing well in the most important tournament of the year. Days after being labelled overrated by his fellow players, Rickie Fowler produced the perfect response, by winning the Players Championship in sensational style on Sunday. This is Rickie Fowler’s approach on the iconic 17th at TPC Sawgrass on the way to becoming the clubhouse leader at 12 under par. Sergio Garcia’s long birdie putt and 17 as well put him at 12 under and into a 3-way play-off with Kevin Kisner -- at 17. Kevin Kisnerjoined the trio and he was part of the final two as Garcia dropped out. Faldo won the second PGA tour title. The American and Ian Poulter were voted the most overrated players by their peers, in an anonymous survey conducted by Sports Illustrated. To be able to put myself in that position over the last few, the way I was playing on Saturday, and into the first part of today’s round, did everything I could to fight and hang around. Finally everything clicked. To play the last six holes that way and to step up and continue that in the play-off, big thanks to 17. It has been a big help this week. Barring a monumental mess-up from Manchester United, Liverpool can no longer qualify for the Champions League next season. They missed their last realistic chance to finish in the English Premier League top four after drawing 1-1 with Chelsea. at Stamford Bridge as a gesture of goodwill. You know, they have absolutely murdered me for years. It was because I never signed here. Which is fair enough, it is part of the football banter, if you like. So it was a nice touch, but I’m well aware, you know, it was only a moment. I’ve had great support from the Liverpool fans, that’s all that really matters to me. And I can’t thank them enough for all the support over the years. Wolfsburg have bolstered their forward line for the next Bundesliga season by signing Max Kruse, from Borussia Moenchengladbach, on a four-year contract. And what a Sunday for the Wolves, because they have also secured a spot in the Champions League next season. They have made sure of my top three finish with two matches to spare. They beat Paderborn 3-1. Timm Klose opened the scoring, heading in from Ricardo Rodriguez’s corner. Here is their second, a terrific switch to the right side, where Bas Dost was lurking on the post. And Dost got his double, when he was in the right place to kick in a sloppy save from Lukas Kruse. So that is 16 goals in the League this season for the Dutchman. Manchester United-bound Memphis Depay is bidding farewell to the Eredivisie in style. He scored a stunning free kick, as Dutch champions PSV Eindhoven beat Heracles 2-0. The 21-year-old received a great send-off from the PSV faithful, who will miss his goal-scoring ability when he moves to the English Premier League next season. And how about this for his 22nd League goal of the season? his 22nd league goal of the season? That is why Louis van Gaal had to act fast, or lose him. Manchester United forked out a reported $35 million for the striker. Nico Rosberg won Formula One’s Spanish Grand Prix, with Lewis Hamilton completing another Mercedes one-two finish. Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel was third. So Hamilton’s lead has been cut to 20 points ahead of Rosberg in the championship. Nick Parrott reports. You will get short odds on Lewis Hamilton to retain his world title, but they were stacked in Nico Rosberg’s favour for victory in Barcelona. 18 of the last 30 winners had started from pole, and the German 18 of the last 24 winners had started from pole, and the German was destined to continue that trend. Unusually Hamilton was slow off the mark, and could only watch as his Mercedes team-mate surged away, and then Sebastian Vettel roared past. That forced him to change strategy and make an earlier pit stop. It wasn’t the smoothest, but a brief delay did not hold Hamilton back. He eventually found himself in the lead after Vettel and Rosberg made their final tyre change, but the Britain still had one to make. This time it went like clockwork. It returned him ahead of Vettel. But this time Rosberg was out of sight. His margin of victory was greater than any Hamilton has enjoyed this season. Yes! It was a virtuoso performance that could see him conduct a comeback in the championship. Italian Elia Viviani said it is incredible to win his first stage in the Giro d’Italia. It came down to the sprint finish in Genoa. Viviani got the better of Moreno Hofland and Andre Greipel on the line. A LeBronjames buzzer-beater won the game for the Cleveland Cavaliers against the Chicago Bulls. King james’s shot from the corner made it 86-84 to the Cavs. So it levels the Eastern Conference semi-final series at 2-2. ~ I wanted to get a good look. I faked like I was going to go for the lob. I bounced it back to the left corner and just took the shot that I’m very comfortable with taking. I was able to knock it down. Like I said, it is a huge win for our group. It means more thanjust a a huge win for our group. It means more than just a win for our young group, for us to come through like tonight was huge? . This is a sport. The fourth world paper plane Championships in Austria. 46,000 entrants were reduced to 200 contenders, contestants in Salzburg. The title for throwing the furthest went to Bulgaria’s Veselin Ivanov. He threw his plane over 53 metres. He was pretty happy. The most aerobatic flight and longest flight time titles were also up for grabs. Ryan Naccarato could only come third in the acrobatics, but he impressed with his hover technique. He is my best. I have tried to do mine here, we will see how it goes.

Let’s see if this takes off. I’ll see you soon. Goodbye. Hello there. It looks as though our week ahead will have something for everyone. If you want the quiet weather, we start our week like that, and it will be quite warm as well, with some sunny spells. However, if you are a gardener or a grower and you want further rain for the gardens, well, there will be plenty of that perhaps by Thursday. We have got some rain around at the moment, stretching out of Scotland and Northern Ireland, and that will be drifting south-east. It will be a relatively mild start to Monday morning as well, temperatures widely into double figures. Our weather front continues to push south and east, weakening all the time, but always an area of low pressure to the north-west keeps the winds a feature into Scotland and Northern Ireland, and it will bring with it further showers as the day continues. But it will be a relatively quiet, bright start across Northern Ireland and Scotland. Some sunshine coming through. Showers should be fairly isolated first thing in the morning. The winds will continue to strengthen, and the showers more of a feature into the afternoon. There is our weather front, then, just moving out of the Scottish borders into the north of England and Wales. Still a little bit of rain on it, but conditions here will improve as the day continues. The odd spot or two of rain into the south-west too. For the Midlands and the south-west corner, maybe starting off bright with some sunshine coming through, a pleasant enough start to the day. Now as the day continues, our weather front sinks south and east, weakening. just a band of cloud as it pushes into the Midlands, turning the sunshine somewhat hazy, and maybe along the south coast we could see a little bit of mist clinging here. Behind it, sharp showers and stronger winds developing in the far north, some of those showers heavy and possibly thundery. But it will still be relatively warm, 15-18. Highest values are likely across the Midlands, eastern England and south-east England. 22,23 degrees not out the question. The exception perhaps along the Channel coast, where we keep that cloud here. Now as we go into Tuesday, the most straightforward description into Wednesday morning, things will turn a little chilly, particularly in rural spots. And certainly worth bearing in mind if you have put some tender plants in the garden, there is the potential for a frost. But Wednesday again will be bright with decent sunshine before the rain arrives on Thursday and some of it will turn quite heavy, particularly into the south-east corner. That’s it, enjoy your week. ~ Welcome to BBC News - broadcasting at home and around the globe. I’m Daniela Ritorto.

Commemorations for the 70th anniversary of Victory in Europe at the end of the Second World War have culminated with a parade in London and a service of thanksgiving. The Queen led the congregation at Westminster Abbey, where the Archbishop of Canterbury spoke of victory ""over the greatest darkness of the 20th Century"". Hundreds of surviving veterans were involved in the parade, as Nicholas Witchell reports on a day of remembrance. A day of national thanksgiving for a victory, receding a little into history now but undiminished in significance. Without this victory, there would have been no freedom. The commemoration was led within the ancient walls of Westminster Abbey by a monarch who remembers VE Day and knows only too well the scale of her generation’s sacrifice. The Queen placed her wreath at the grave of the Unknown Warrior. 70 years ago she appeared on VE Day on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with her father, King George VI, as the crowd celebrated victory in Europe. Today in Westminster Abbey, the Queen listened as words from her father’s VE Day speech giving thanks for Britain’s deliverance were recalled. Speaking from our empire’s oldest capital city, war battered but never... Never for one moment daunted or dismayed, speaking from London, I asked you tojoin with me in that act of thanksgiving. (LAST POST SOUNDS). 70 years after the war in Europe ended, a single guardsmen sounded the Last Post. At the west door of Westminster Abbey, the Queen met some of the veterans, members of a generation bonded by memories of when the United Kingdom and its allies stood against tyranny. And then, in the spring sunshine, the veterans marched, to the acclamation of the crowds, through Parliament Square and up Whitehall, pausing to pay their respects at the Cenotaph at those many friends who were lost. In the skies above, two Hurricaines and a Spitfire from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight adding their tribute to an indefatigable generation which has now grown old, but which 70 years ago would not be beaten. The German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, says relations between Russia and the West have suffered a serious setback because of the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Mrs Merkel had earlier attended a wreath-laying ceremony in Moscow to commemorate soldiers killed during World War Two. She and other Western leaders declined invitations to a military parade in Red Square on Saturday. Sarah Rainsford reports from Moscow. A moment’s sombre reflection at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Angela Merkel came here to pay her respects to the millions of Soviet citizens killed in the war with Nazi Germany. A war in which Vladimir Putin’s own father fought. But, like many Western leaders, the German Chancellor shunned Mr Putin’s Victory Day parade. All this was to mark 70 years since Hitler’s surrender, but it was a display of modern-day military might too, as Russia deploys troops in the Ukraine. Angela Merkel expressed her deep gratitude here in Moscow to those who paid such a high price in defeating Hitler, but in her position on the Ukraine she remains firm. She says the deal she helped to negotiate must be implemented, and the integrity of Ukraine must be restored. So current politics, not history, dominated this encounter, but there seemed to be little meeting of minds. Angela Merkel talks of returning Crimea to Ukraine. Vladimir Putin blames Kiev for violating the ceasefire and denies any Russian troops are involved. After their meeting, Mr Putin did pledge to get the rebels to enforce the peace deal, but behind him Angela Merkel EI’ISUIâEd i’IEIâ ITIESSBQE WGS StI’oI’Ig. TRANSLATION: The criminal annexation of Crimea, which is a violation of international order, and the military conflict in eastern Ukraine have been a serious setback in our relations. We see it as violating the peaceful order of Europe. Today’s visit, though, took a lesson from history about the need to resolve conflicts through dialogue, however difficult. Germany’s leader admitted the peace deal for Ukraine may not succeed but she said it’s the only deal they’ve got. Typhoon Noul has crashed into the north of the Philippines with gusts of up to 220 kilometres per hour. The category-five storm caused thousands of people to leave their homes fearing the threat of flash floods and landslides. The typhoon is now moving away from the Philippines towards Taiwan where nearly 1000 tourists have been evacuated off the south-east coast. Ben Bland reports. This is what the Philippines have been bracing itself for. Typhoon Noul, said to be the strongest storm to hit the country so far this year. Winds of more than 220 kilometres an hour battered Cagayan province in the north-east. Ferries and flights were cancelled, leaving thousands of passengers stranded. There were fears of landslides and waves two metres high. Entire villages along the coast were evacuated, and people taken to higher ground. TRANSLATION: They came and told us to evacuate, because we are living on the coastline. The waves could destroy our homes. Forecasters expect the storm will weaken before moving towards on Tuesday. The very strongest winds concentrated around the edge of that eye. It was a near miss for other parts of the largest islands in the Philippines. Over the next couple of days, we will see the storm pushing northwards, pulled apart by strong upper-level winds, and the energy reduced as it moves over cold waters. It is likely to take heavy rain across central and southern parts ofjapan later on Monday and Wednesday into Tuesday. Electricity supplies were cut in parts of the Philippines. For many people now, an anxious wait. Not knowing when they can return home, and what they would find when they do. Ben Bland, BBC News. Well a short while ago, I spoke to Dr Mahar Lagmay. The director of the Philippine Nationwide Operational Assessment of Hazards. He spoke to me from Manila. The situation now is that it has passed over the northern islands of the Philippines. When it passed, now we are still waiting for the reports coming in from the local government units on what the effects were of the typhoon. So far, we have not had any major reports of house, he was on the roof. There was electricity and that we know of so far. House of so far. Compared to Typhoon Haiyan that devastated the Philippines about 18 months ago? That is right. It is very severe. Infact, it is the strongest typhoon to hit the Philippines this year. Sparking winds of 200 kilometres per hour. It made landfall at the northern tip. Estimations that were made were very low because of the depth of the water is Bair. -- there. Although the water levels are significantly lower than the warnings made two days before Typhoon Haiyan made landfall. Storm surge heights were about five or six metres, but this time it was less than two. But we are still waiting for reports coming from the provinces. Hopefully, there is not much damage in the coastal areas. And also, the rainfall wasn’t too heavy. It was moderate to heavy. Only in specific places near to the eye of the storm.

The 17-year-old was arrested in a raid on Friday. Police say they found bombs at the boy’s home and that they’d prevented an imminent attack. Phil Mercer, our correspondent in Sydney, gave me the latest. Well, it was a very brief appearance by this 17-year-old boy. He was flanked by security guards. He didn’t apply for bail and has been remanded into custody, facing terrorism related offences, and the boy is due back in court in a few weeks’ time. He was arrested on Friday evening when heavily armed police officers raided a house in Melbourne’s northern suburbs, and we understand that the boy is the son of a respected doctor, and the police allege that they were thwarting an imminent threat to the community. And investigators say that, at that address, they found three improvised explosive devices that were made safe in a nearby park, so some very serious offences that this boy is being charged with, and, as we say, making a very brief appearance at a children’s court in Melbourne. Obviously being a children’s court, there are restrictions on reporting and identifying this boy. What are the chances of him, though, being tried as an adult? Well, that’s up to prosecutors and the courts. A senior police officer in Melbourne did say that there was scope within the legislation for the boy to appear in an adults’ court, but that of course is a decision to be made further down the track. Over the weekend we did hear from the Australian Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, talking about the broader security challenges for Australia, Mr Abbott saying that this country faced a very serious threat from home-grown extremism, and although Mr Abbott urged Australians to be vigilant, he did say that it was a very small number of people who were intent on doing Australia harm. Worth noting, too, that, in September of last year, the government here raised the domestic security threat level from medium to high for the first time. Phil Mercer in Sydney.

A powerful typhoon has hit the north-east Philippines, forcing thousands to find shelter from flash floods and landslides. As if the people of Nepal haven’t had enough to deal with in the days after the earthquake, Mother Nature is again having a disastrous impact, with more landslides and avalanches in one of the worst-affected areas. The search and rescue effort in the devastated Langtang Valley is suspended because of the bad weather. Police in the area say at least 300 people are missing, and hundreds of others are desperate for help, and all aid workers can do is to wait the weather out. Well, in the capital, heritage and restoration experts are trying to figure out how to salvage the city’s damaged temples. Some of them are hundreds of years old. But as Yogita Limaye explains, parts of Kathmandu culture may be lost forever. Towering over the Kathmandu Valley, one of Nepal’s most prominent landmarks. This temple is among one of the most revered religious sites in the country. Today, the main building is surrounded by a pile of rubble, where temples used to stand. Priests here have onlyjust begun morning prayers again. Their families have lived here for centuries. The earthquake destroyed their homes too. TRANSLATION: For us, this is like a mother and father. My parents told me that people would save money on their food and donate it to get it built. That is the kind of devotion people have towards the temple. I can’t express in words what has been lost. But they are trying to save whatever remains of the ancient structures, even as there are fears the whole complex may have been left unstable. They are still to check whether this golden tower has faced any structural damage, but right here, this area has to be completely rebuilt. The earthquake has taken away a big piece of Nepal’s heritage. Across the city of Kathmandu, some of the historical and religious sites have been worst affected. The terrifying moment captured by tourists in this square. Two temples, built 300 years ago, crumbled in a matter of seconds. Today, what would have been full of tourists is partly in ruins. The royal complex was famous for its intricate carvings and beautiful architecture. Some parts are lost. We need to phase it out in two years. You know, it is no use trying to do everything immediately. What we have to make sure is done immediately, is make sure much of the material is safeguarded, and structures aren’t demolished just because they might have certain cracks. It is going to be a long road to recovery. The earthquake took with it so many of Nepal’s people, and also a part of Nepal’s soul. Extreme weather conditions across the central United States has left parts of Texas flooded. The national guard was called into to aid rescue workers The National Guard was called into to aid rescue workers near Denton as flash floods trapped people in their cars and homes. Tornados ripped through the north of the state yesterday followed by heavy rainfall. The severe weather continued up through the central plains with tornados destroying houses and injuring nine people in South Dakota. Pretty dramatic pictures there. Cuban President Raul Castro has thanked Pope Francis for brokering the thaw between Havana and Washington. He said the Pope’s modesty and wisdom so impressed him that he might return to the Catholic Church, despite being a communist. David Willey reports from Rome. This was not a state visit. Simply a long, private chat in Spanish, without interpreters. It enabled Raul Castro to thank Pope Francis in person for his role in breaking more than half a century of antagonism between Cuba and the United States. Then there was an exchange of gifts. Pope Francis will spend two days in Cuba, on his way to the United States in September. He seems to have enchanted the Cuban leader who, like his brother Fidel Castro, was baptised a Catholic. Later, President Castro met the Italian Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi, who made it clear that he was deeply impressed by his talk with the first Pope from Latin America. TRANSLATION: If the Pope keeps on talking this way, sooner or later I’ll start praying again, and I’ll return to the Catholic Church. And I’m not kidding, I’m a Communist, and the Cuban Communist Party has never accepted religion. But now, by allowing it, we are taking a step forward. and by Pope Emeritus Benedict. Many church activities were suppressed after the Communist revolution. But Raul Castro attended a jesuit-run school in Cuba, and he joked that in a certain sense he felt he was a jesuit, just like the Pope. For Pope Francis, the brokering of the restoration of relations between the US and Cuba, conducted in secret inside the Vatican last year, has been a major diplomatic triumph. A new Bollywood musical has launched in London after a successful run in Mumbai. Beyond Bollywood is the brainchild of two of its most creative talents, director Rajeev Goswami and lyricist Irfan Siddiqui. It is billed as an explosion of colour and movement, with dance and drama. So where better to stage it than the historic London Palladium? BBC News got a sneak preview of what to expect. India is a loud country, and we celebrate loud, you know. This show, it is like... I say it is a one-stop shop. I will make sure that you feel that you are in India. Today we are at the Dance Attic Studio. And it is great. The moment we entered the studio we felt like, oh my god, this is for real. We are rehearsing today, we are doing a couple of songs, run-throughs. We are aiming for perfection every day, so this is one of those days. I am playing the lead role of Shaily Shergill in the musical. I am actually playing this dancer who really wants to follow her mother’s footsteps and make it big, for her mother and for her legacy. I am playing Raghav’s character in the play. And he’s a folk dancer, but somehow things did not work out for him because dancing in India is not that respected, or whatever. So then he meets Shaily and he takes her around India and shows her what folk dancing and India is all about in the play. Our show is taking you through the cultures of India, so that, you know, you have travelled through India, and you feel like you are part of the the journey. It is such a big country, India, there are so many dance styles and so many regions. It was an eye opener for me and the audience who said, we are Indians but we don’t know these dance styles. So trust me, When people in London come, they will take India back with them. The Indian instruments like tabla, sitar with some live classical dancing, it’s going to be fun. It’s a lot of dancing. It’s got a variety of... Like, when you go back after the show, you will go back with a part of India with you. It’s a dream come true. It’s a dream turned into reality. I hope everybody likes it. Looks terrific, doesn’t it? Prince Harry’s latest stop on his New Zealand tour took him back to school on the remote Stewart Island. He took part in a German class with students of the Half Moon Bay school that services the islands 378 residents. He joked that he had failed to learn German and forgotten most of the French he’d learnt in school. Stay with us on BBC News. Much more to come. CUC and. ~ "" SEE yOU SOOFI. Hello there. It looks as though our week ahead will have something for everyone. If you want the quiet weather, we start our week like that, and it will be quite warm as well, with some sunny spells. However, if you are a gardener or a grower and you want further rain for the gardens, well, there will be plenty of that perhaps by Thursday. We have got some rain around at the moment, stretching its way out of Scotland and Northern Ireland, and that will be drifting south-east. It will be a relatively mild start to Monday morning as well, temperatures widely into double figures. Our weather front continues to push south and east, weakening all the time, but always an area of low pressure to the north-west keeps the winds a feature into Scotland and Northern Ireland, and it will bring with it further showers as the day continues. But it will be as the day continues. But it will be a relatively quiet, bright start across Northern Ireland and Scotland. Some sunshine coming through. Showers should be fairly isolated first thing in the morning. The winds will continue to strengthen, and the showers more of a feature into the afternoon. There is our weather front, then, just moving out of the Scottish borders into the north of England and Wales. Still a little bit of rain on it, but conditions here will improve as the day continues. The odd spot or two of rain into the south-west too. For the Midlands and the south-east corner, maybe starting off bright with some sunshine coming through, a pleasant enough start to the day. Now as the day continues, our weather front sinks south far north, some of those showers heavy and possibly thundery. But it will still be relatively warm, 15-18 degrees. Highest values are likely across the Midlands, eastern England and south-east England. 22,23 degrees not out the question. The exception perhaps along the Channel coast, where we keep that cloud here. Now as we go into Tuesday, the most straightforward description for Tuesday, sunny spells and scattered showers, particularly first thing in the morning. Those showers should become fairly isolated into the afternoon, staying up into the north-west, where the winds will remain a feature, highs of 11-19, so just that little bit fresher. Then as we move through Tuesday night with those clearer skies into Wednesday morning, things will turn a little chilly, particularly in rural spots. And certainly worth bearing in mind if you have put some tender plants into the garden, there is the potential for being a frost. But Wednesday again will be bright with decent sunshine before the rain arrives on Thursday and some of it will turn quite heavy, particularly into the south-east corner. That’s it, enjoy your week. ~ The latest headlines from BBC News. I’m Daniela Ritorto.

The Muslim Brotherhood was Fqvpts Montague. The Muslim Brotherhood was Egypt’s oldest and wants most successful political movement. It has offshoots and followers throughout the Middle East, but some say it is on the verge of extinction, a victim of its own failure in government. When Muhammad Mercy was deposed as Egypt’s President, the organisation was banned, and is now we can notjust in Egypt’s, that across the Middle East, my guest today is one of its political leaders, Amr Darrag. He is in self-imposed exile in Turkey, and says ""we will come back"". But how? Do Egyptians want them back, anyway? Amr Darrag, welcome to HARDtalk. Thank you very much. Given what has happened to the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt’s, how can it survive as an organisation? -- Egypt. The Muslim Brotherhood has been there for more than 80 years. It survived a lot of events, many, if you will, disasters at certain moments of history. And it survived. This is mainly because it is notjust a political group of people, but a social movement that is spread over the country, and it has supporters and believers and grassroots everywhere. But given that its leaders are a large part-- in large part locked up, it is banned, and described as a terrorist organisation, you yourself are in Turkey because you cannot operate there. How are you able... What are the practical at -- practicalities of operating a group like that? As a matter of fact, we are a large group, as I are locked up in prison or some are outside Egypt. ago countrywide. The leadership has almost become a new leadership everywhere in the country. Down from the grassroots up to the highest levels. We have leadership that is working. Of course it is working in difficult conditions, but it is working. Working underground, and are you able to communicate with it? Well, it is not underground. Actually, if you follow the protests that are going on everywhere, every day in Egypt, people are in the streets. I, for example, I’m talking to you right now. I’m not underground. We have a leadership for Egyptians outside of Egypt. We elected a new office for the Egyptians who left Egypt to support our friends Egyptians who left Egypt to support ourfriends inside doing what Egyptians who left Egypt to support our friends inside doing what they cannot do. Like speaking to the media, talking to international players, following up illegal cases, human rights violations cases. And so on. We aren’t underground. We are everywhere and working. Of course in difficult conditions, asl everywhere and working. Of course in difficult conditions, as I said, but we are working. We’ve been through hardships like this before. The trouble is, at the moment committee appear to have lost the trust most Egyptians. -- at the moment, you appear. The man who heads the Cairo bureau of a Egypt newspaper says that you have notjust bureau of a Egypt newspaper says that you have not just lost that you have notjust lost power politically but public trust. At ruling, they are a complete failure. Actually, I don’t know the basis of that statement. For example, if you follow the results of the poll that was conducted by the organisation in September 2014, and that organisation, by the way, is financed by the emirates, it shows the popularity of the Muslim Brotherhood is at 44%, that is almost the level of normal support that we normally get in elections. So, this is not true. Losing popularity is untrue. Actually, I might also add that we left the government, Morsi was ousted from his position as president, notjust because he failed but a military coup, that needs to be taken into account. You quote a poll that the market analysis Institute BMI research said in May this year that while there are numerous weaknesses with opinion polling in Egypt, the official and anecdotal information we have appears to support the regime of President al-Sisi. Well, actually, I’m not aware of this. But yes, there are... Do you think you are more popular than the current regime? The current regime is a regime that came out a dash of a military coup. That’s not what I ask you. I asked, military coup. That’s not what I ask you. Iasked, do you. I asked, do you think the Muslim Brotherhood is more popular than the regime, the government of President al-Sisi? Yes, Ido, Ido think so. Let me add, what we are talking about is notjust the Muslim Brotherhood, but all elements of Egypt rule. The Egyptians have been disappointed by losing the path of democracy, following the 2011 revolution. That was abandoned by the military coup of Muhammad -- of President al-Sisi and his gang. Forgive me for interrupting, but this was a government you were Ministerfor a few months this was a government you were Minister for a few months between May and july, the final months of the Morsi government, that was a government that had, as a result of what it had done in its year in power, millions ended up on the streets across Egypt’s protesting against it, and the polls showed again, that by the end, popularity had fallen to 32%. Even if it is 32%, this is not the way governments go. Normally, governments have their full opportunities to finish their terms, presidents finish their terms, and then go to elections. The ballot boxes. They chose whether it is true or not. If the government says that, it is highly possible, the people change the government, not the military. This is the main point. You know the mood in Egypt’s when that military coup happened. -- Egypt. You know in an election since then, although people will be critical of how the election was held, you secured 96% support? -- he secured. Well actually, I don’t know if you can call this an election, he had no competition and was administering the elections. Everybody knew it was a force. I can’t comment on that. It’s beyond the imagination. In modern history, in the beginning of the 21st century, somebody gets 97% of the poll. It was on turnout of 47.5%. President Morsi was elected on a turnout of 52%. Not that different? 47% is the figure that was given by the government. But estimates, fair estimates, by a lot of organisations, indicate the turnout was not more than ten or 11%. Amr Darrag, you will know that many people in Egypt or who you government made work let me tell you, let me remind our audience government made work let me tell you, let me remind ouraudience here that that was not the Muslim Brotherhood government. The Muslim Brotherhood element in the government was only 25%. That was mainly a technocrat government. The Prime Minister was independent. We participated by a small fraction. President Mohamed Morsi was a former member of the Muslim Brotherhood, and appointed other members of the Muslim Brotherhood, which is one of the things that infuriated people. It was not seen as an inclusive government. I don’t want to go through this argument. Really, if you tally the people who were appointed by the president, including the government, this statement would turn out not to be true. But anyway... statement would turn out not to be true. Butanyway... I’m true. But anyway... I’m curious, what do you think went wrong? What do you think the government of Morsi got wrong? You have to remember, the government and the presidency of Morsi came right after the revolution. That ended up more than 30 years of dictatorship. Everything was in a miserable condition. That is number one. Two, when Mia Barak was removed, his state did not allow us to work properly. That would have happened with any government. The rule of the media, that was mainly manipulated by the businessman who belonged to the Hosni Mubarak agenda, and the role of the military who were planning for a military coup, orthat who were planning for a military coup, or that resulted in a lot of problems -- Mubarak. Nevertheless, I’m not saying that did not make problems... Listen, it sounds almost as if you aren’t accepting or remembering what happened in Egypt’s during that time. It’s notjust that things were difficult. There were virtually daily strikes, power cuts, there was a rise in crime, living standards falling. That is why people ended up being very angry, and also this charge against the president who had, of course, tried to strip the judges of the right to challenge anything he did, he was seen as operating for the few? OK, if you want to compare that to the situation right now, what is the difference? As a matter of fact, as I said, the situation in Egypt was different as a result of years of bad governance and corruption. I would refer you to the second day the coup took place. Before the coup, yes, there were a lot of shortages of fuel. And in electricity. The next day, everything returned to normal. There was somebody controlling the supply of fuel, and that was part of the conspiracy. But anyway... of fuel, and that was part of the conspiracy. Butanyway... So conspiracy. But anyway... So it was all a conspiracy? You will know that there is a widespread feeling, perhaps, Ashraf al Sharif is a lecturer, and sums it up by saying it will take a long time to undo the negative perceptions of the brotherhood -- Muslim Brotherhood. The scale and scope of anti- brotherhood sentiments due to their failed government experiment must be reckoned with. Let me tell you, in any democratic regime, or system, when the government does not succeed, it is allowed to complete its terms, and then the people have the right to remove the government through elections. As if, you know, people are justifying that whenever a government does not respond to the aspirations of people, the military should intervene, and can have military coups. You have said the Muslim Brotherhood will be back. It has widespread support, and you talk about new leaders. It is a young leadership, as you described them as the new revolutionaries. New supporters have been quoted as using the slogan ""anything aside from bullets is peaceful"". What do you understand that to mean? There are many who see that as almost an incitement to violence in Egypt. Asa As a matter of fact, those who commit violence are the government and regime. They kill thousands of people because of the practices of the regime during the peaceful protests. I’m asking you about the Muslim Brotherhood and its intentions now. When you have supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood saying anything by side bullets is peaceful, what do they mean? What are the aims of the Muslim Brotherhood now? -- besides. The aims of the Muslim Brotherhood as part of the general protest of democracy lovers in Egypt is to regain the democratic path. And the methodology they are following is based on peaceful means. This has been going on for almost two years right now. And we know quite well that this is the only that we can get back our democracy. By the way, the protests that are going on in the streets of Egypt include not more than 30% Muslim Brotherhood, maybe more than 70% of the protests are others, other political factions, normal religious endowments under Mohamed Morsi said killing President CC or any of the criminal leaders brings one closer to God and if a person is killed while trying to defend Sisi is a martyr. Can you defend that? I am not aware of that statement but anyway this person is not representative of the Muslim Brotherhood. Do you disagree with that sentiment? Yes, definitely I disagree. I definitely disagree. We again insist as leadership of the Muslim Brotherhood to maintain the peaceful nature of the protest as much as we can. Of course we can control our people, but we don’t have means to control others. But you can control your Facebook page and there was an opinion piece put on the... Your website and there was an opinion piece put on the... Yourwebsite injanuary calling for everyone to get psychologically and physically ready forjihad. We’re about to start a new phase, mobilising all our powers, calling for relentless jihad in which we aim for the honourable status of martyrs. How do you explain that? As you say, it was an opinion piece and also this is not our official website. This is just opinion piece and also this is not our official website. This isjust a media outlet that opens the door for anybody who writes opinions. It is reflecting those who support the Muslim Brotherhood? As I said, as an opinion piece. If I go and publish anything in the Guardian or any UK journal, it doesn’t mean that Ira present the opinion of that newspaper. This is an opinion. Everybody knows this only represents the opinion of the person who wrote that piece. Many people you know will also think that it represents a large group of people within the Muslim Brotherhood, the people who you may be trying control or perhaps tamp downjust to you may be trying control or perhaps tamp down just to calm them you may be trying control or perhaps tamp downjust to calm them down, but that that sentiment is widely felt among young people within the Muslim Brotherhood? Sarah, our official statements and particularly after the article you are referring to was very clear, that this is not the path that we support. We support a peaceful path. And this is reflected in all our statements. We don’t have a statement that indicates otherwise, not one. As a matter of fact, right now this website is not currently operating as an open media outlet, it isjust reflecting the official statements of the Muslim Brotherhood. If you go to that website you see all of those statements that reflect our advice to people to remain peaceful. There is a former member of the Muslim Brotherhood, now an analyst, who says the approach of the organisation now, raising the slogan of overthrowing the regime, is an expression of complete separation from facts. The popular move doesn’t favour revolutions, Egyptians are tired and despondent. That’s the other charge levelled at you, you are not offering any practical solution, anything that actually Egyptians want, which is a positive vision of what the country might look like. Well, as I’ve said, we have been there for more than eight years. We have always responded to the aspirations of people. As a social movement, we have a full record of support of the people in all aspects of life at times where governments were not actually providing anything. But again, as I’m saying, theissue anything. But again, as I’m saying, the issue now in Egypt is not about the 2-2 any other political faction, it’s about regaining the democratic path, which has to be really supported by everybody that loves democracy all over the world -- Muslim Brotherhood. country after country. Yet here we are, you left which is why you are now in Turkey. This seems to be a problem for the Muslim Brotherhood across the region, that country after country, the UAE and Saudi Arabia have called you a terrorist organisation. You are being squeezed out of everywhere. Let me correct what you said. I was not asked to leave Qatar. As a matter of fact, at that time I was planning anyway to come to Turkey in order to have my think tank established there, which is operating. And we met some leaders of the Brotherhood at that time in Qatar, we met with officials and they clearly indicated that it is our decision whether or not to stay in Qatar. And only five people out of the Muslim Brotherhood ( R at that time, and hundreds of others are still there. Forgive me for interrupting, the Qatari government did not ask you to leave and they would be happy if the leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood went back, with a? I was already there about a month ago. Sure, but there are other leaders. -- would you. If they wanted to abiding by the rules of the country where he is welcome. in Qatar. Many people are in other countries and we are all working and practising our role as a group that is opting for going back to democracy in Egypt. If you’re interested in democracy in Egypt, you will know that President Sisi said in September last year that the opportunity to participate is there but on the condition there is no violence and strife and that theyjo genuine democratic practices and transfer of power. If you are committed peaceful democracy in Egypt, will you go back and respond to that offer? Will you even perhaps put up independent candidates in the election later this year? As a matter of fact, this offer is definitely not serious and it’s not applicable only to the Muslim Brotherhood. Look at the political environment in Egypt, there is no political power around. The elections were supposed to take place a year ago and it has been postponed month after month after month. Nobody knows when and where this election is will take place or whether they will take place. If it does happen this year as promised, would you put up candidates? We are not allowed to put up candidates because our party is banned. But the Muslim Brotherhood used to stand candidates under independent labels, you could do that again? This would be a farce. Right now what the regime is doing is actually aborting any chance of any democratic practice. Actually Qosi is not only about collections, you have to have access to people, access to media outlets, you have to explain your ideas and programmes and explain and co-operate and make alliances and all that political work. Nobody is allowed, notjust us, nobody in Egypt is allowed to do that freely right now. What is the alternative? The likes of Mustaffa Hashem, an Egyptianjournalist who specialises injihadi movements, specialises in jihadi movements, makes specialises injihadi movements, makes the point that if you forego the offer of reconciliation you risk becoming a violent organisation and in doing so in a road much of your support. Actually the Muslim Brotherhood has never been and will never be a violent organisation -- erode. We are a social movement that is deeply grass rooted in the society and we depend on the support of the people. Sometimes the support goes up, sometimes it goes down. But at the end of the day we are their. To the best of my knowledge there’s no other social or political movement in Egypt that has been there that long. That’s why I say we are going to come back. But my concern, my worries are not about the Muslim Brotherhood. My concerns are about the future of my country and the future of democracy in my country. That’s why we will be working with all our colleagues in other political and movements who really are interested in regaining the democratic path in Egypt in order to do that. Amr Darrag, thank you very much for coming on HARDtalk. Thank you. Hello there. It looks as though our week ahead will have something for everyone.

Our top story this hour: The Greek economy is back at the top of the agenda for eurozone finance ministers who will meet in a few hours. And it’s notjust them that the government has to win over. More protests kick off in Greece as the population grows restless. Welcome to the programme. Other stories that we are keeping across for you. Typhoon Noul batters the northern Philippines, forcing thousands to flee their homes. When is a mummy not mummified? In business: Deja vu. Plus China sees a cut in interest rates, the first drop for some time. We will have a look at what it means for the economy. First, Greece’s Syriza government is said to be hopeful that a meeting of Eurozone finance ministers on Monday will ease the way for a further injection of cash for the troubled country. However, ministers have ruled out a deal to unlock aid for Greece, saying that the country is yet to produce a credible plan for economic reform. Meanwhile, those in Greece who voted for Syriza are watching closely to make sure the party keeps its promises. Chris Morris reports from Athens. Dock workers on strike in Athens, anxious that the radical left wing Syriza government many of them helped elect may be forced to break a promise not to privatise their airport in order to raise much needed money. This is a gentle reminder that, needed money. This is a gentle reminderthat, as reminder that, as well as pressure from the EU and IMF, there is also pressure on Syriza from below, from the street, not to give up too easily on the things they promised to do. They have to be loyal to their declaration and to their promises before the elections as much as possible. We know that the pressure is huge, but there are certain points that they cannot go back. It’s a huge dilemma for the ministers negotiating with Greece’s international creditors. Other countries in the Eurozone want Greece to accept a deal that would look a lot like their old bailout agreement, that a government elected to bring austerity to an end says it has two be able to offer something different. Obviously that means we will have a compromise in other areas, and obviously the final agreement, no one will see their complete face in it, because, if you see your complete faith in it, you haven’t compromised, but that means compromise from both sides. If they get nothing back from Europe, they will be pressure to put these contracted negotiations to a referendum, and with some in Syriza calling for a default on Greek debt and the next it from the Euro, the result would not be a foregone conclusion -- exit. Obviously this is something Sally will be looking at in World Business Report. Good morning. As you’ve been hearing, it’s another critical week for Greece. While Eurozone finance ministers meet in Greece, the Greek government is facing another deadline tomorrow as it’s due to pay the International Monetary Fund 750 million euros. In World Business Report we’ll be getting the view of the head of China has cut interest rates for the 3rd time in six months in an attempt to rekindle the country’s economy. The People’s Bank of China has cut its one-year lending rate by a quarter of a point to 5.1%. Rates have fallen from 6% since November as China heads towards its slowest rate of growth in nearly a quarter of a century. So will it have an impact? We’ll look closer at that in World Business Report. We’ve got those stories and all the other business news you need to be across today. Amnesty International has released a new report looking into the horrific abuse faced faced by Libyan migrants that drives them to risk their lives to try to reach Europe. Based on dozens of interviews, it says migrants are systematically abused by employers and have no legal avenues to seek safety. Conditions in detention centres are described as often appalling. On Monday the European Union’s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, will attempt to secure a United Nations mandate for the use of military force against people traffickers operating in the region. Typhoon Noul has hit the north of the Philippines with gusts of up to 220 kilometres per hour. The category-five storm caused thousands of people to leave their homes fearing the threat of flash floods and landslides. At least two people are reported to have been killed. The typhoon is now moving away from the Philippines towards Taiwan where nearly 1,000 tourists have been evacuated off the south-east coast. Ben Bland reports. This is what the Philippines have been bracing itself for. Typhoon Noul, said to be the strongest storm to hit the country so far this year. Winds of more than 220 kilometres an hour battered Cagayan province in the north-east. Ferries and flights were cancelled, leaving thousands of passengers stranded. There were fears of landslides and waves two metres high. Entire villages along the coast were evacuated, and people taken to higher ground. TRANSLATION: They came and told us to evacuate, because we are living on the coastline. The waves could destroy our homes. Forecasters expect the storm will weaken before moving towards on Tuesday. The very strongest winds concentrated around the edge of that eye. It was a near miss for other parts of the largest islands in the Philippines. Over the next couple of days, we will see the storm pushing northwards, pulled apart by strong upper-level winds, and the energy reduced as it moves over cold waters. It is likely to take heavy rain across central and southern parts ofjapan later on Monday and Wednesday into Tuesday. Electricity supplies were cut in parts of the Philippines. For many people now, an anxious wait. Not knowing when they can return home, and what they would find when they do. Ben Bland, BBC News.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has attended a wreath-laying ceremony in Moscow to commemorate the Russians killed during World War II. Mrs Merkel and other Western leaders declined invitations to a military parade in Red Square on Saturday in protest over Russia’s support of separatists in Eastern Ukraine. President Putin said that a peace deal in Ukraine was progressing, but the German leader addressed the ongoing uncertainty in the country, saying Russia’s annexation of the Crimean peninsula had caused a serious setback in relations. Meanwhile, in Britain, there was applause for World War II veterans as they paraded through central London on the final day of events to commemorate the Allied victory over Nazi Germany. Earlier, the Queen was among members of the royal family attending a service at Westminster Abbey to give thanks for those who sacrificed their lives. Nicholas Witchell reports. A day of national thanksgiving for a victory, receding a little into history now but undiminished in significance. Without this victory, there would have been no freedom. The commemoration was led within the ancient walls of Westminster Abbey by a monarch who remembers VE Day and knows only too well the scale of her generation’s sacrifice. The Queen placed her wreath at the grave of the Unknown Warrior. with her father, King George VI, in Europe. Today in Westminster Abbey, the Queen listened as words from her father’s VE Day speech giving thanks for Britain’s deliverance were recalled. Speaking from our empire’s oldest capital city, war battered but never... Never for one moment daunted or dismayed, speaking from London, I ask you to join with me in that act of thanksgiving. (LAST POST SOUNDS). 70 years after the war in Europe ended, a single guardsmen sounded the Last Post. At the west door of Westminster Abbey, the Queen met some of the veterans, members of a generation bonded by memories of when the United Kingdom and its allies stood against tyranny. And then, in the spring sunshine, the veterans marched, to the acclamation of the crowds, through Parliament Square and up Whitehall, pausing to pay their respects at the Cenotaph at those many friends who were lost. In the skies above, two Hurricanes and a Spitfire from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight adding their tribute to an indefatigable generation which has now grown old, but which 70 years ago would not be beaten.

The latest headlines: Eurozone finance ministers will shortly meet to discuss Greece’s plans for economic reform. A powerful typhoon has hit the north-east Philippines, forcing thousands to find shelter from flash floods and landslides. In Australia, a teenager has appeared in Melbourne’s children’s court, charged with a terror plot. Police said they found bombs at the boy’s home and had prevented an imminent attack. Our correspondent is in Sydney. Many people are going to hear this and think, 17? Yes, we understand that he is the youngest person ever to be charged with this sort of offences. Certainly in the southern states of Victoria. This main, this boy, who can’t be named for legal reasons, appeared before a children’s court in Melbourne flanked by guards. He didn’t apply for bail. It wasn’t given. He was remanded into custody and will reappear in court in the next couple of weeks. He is charged with two terror related offences and police will allege they found improvised explosive devices at a home they raided on Friday in Melbourne’s suburban north, and they do say that, because of their actions, they did thwart an imminent terrorist attack. I know we are not identifying him, or he is not being identified, but do we know much about his background? There are media reports suggesting that this boy is the son of a respected doctor in Melbourne’s northern suburbs. Other reports saying that he was a very shy, studious type. There has been commentary in the media, however, detailing allegations of this teenager’s posts on social media that have become rambling and quite extreme, apparently, in recent weeks, and no doubt the investigation team will be trawling through this boy’s background to try to establish exactly who he was and what, if anything, to establish exactly who he was and what, ifanything, he what, if anything, he was motivated by. But at the moment we don’t know who he is. We certainly know where he lives, and we certainly know that he is charged with some very serious terrorism offences. I know you will be tracking this case and keeping us UP be tracking this case and keeping us up to date. Thank you. programme, has revealed that the contents of many of the bundles of Wrapped in layer upon layer of cloth. Offerings to ancient Egypt’s gods. These animal mummies are more than 2000 years old, and now their secrets are finally being revealed in the largest study of its kind. To study these animal mummies, archaeologists used to have to unripe than, a process that completely destroyed the fragile contents. Now though, scanning technology makes it easy to look inside but scientists have been surprised by what they have found. just move him back in there, that’s it. In Manchester, Egyptologists are using medical imaging to examine hundreds of mummies. Some hold a rich bounty. Inside is a two metre long nail crocodile, revealed in remarkable detail. Shall we move him in? He has a nice mottled face with the nose and two eyes. But others... Oh! Contain hardly any animal at all. Vertebra. And these empty mummies are common. There have been some surprises. We always knew that not all animal mummies contained what we might expect them to contain but we found that about a third contains no animal material at all, so no skill easel remains. The answer may lie here. In Egypt’s ancient catacombs -- skeletal remains. This place alone holds 2 million mother fight ibis birds. 30 similar tombs have been uncovered, containing an estimated 75 million animals -- mummified. There is evidence they were mass bread and then killed but even this might not have been enough. In that period demand really outstripped supply. There was a case that they want enough animals, but pilgrims, the people who were buying them, believed they were getting some sense of the divine, as a gift to the gods. The scans are giving us a chance to look at these animals up close and to probe a process that had become big business. One perhaps where shortcuts were sometimes made. We have been keeping you up-to-date with the typhoon in the Philippines, but also in the US, there has been flooding in Texas. The National Guard has been called to help rescue workers. Flash floods were trapping people in their cars and homes. Tornadoes ripped through the north of the state yesterday followed by heavy rainfall. Severe weather continued through the Central Plains with tornadoes destroying houses and injuring nine people in South Dakota. Onto sport now, and Andy Murray has a message for all you guys and girls out there wondering whether to tie the knot. The British number one tennis star claims that marriage works, after winning the Madrid Open by beating Rafael Nadal. The Spaniard will drop to world number seven now, putting him outside the top five for the first time in a decade. That means a tougher draw for him at the French Open. Rob Heath reports. Rafael Nadal’s kingdom is built on clay. So, on his home surface, in his home country, his authority is absolute. Six times Andy Murray has played him on clay, and six times he has lost. And yet, Murray looked dominant in the first set, taking it 6-3. The world number three played on Spanish clay as a teenager, training in Barcelona. But this is the surface that Nadal normally excels on, and at the start of the second set, it saw him back on form. But not for long. This simply doesn’t happen to Nadal, who has won the tournament four times. But he was swept away in straight sets. Since his wedding last month, Murray’s form has surged. Traditionally he has struggled on clay. What has changed? Well, in his own words, ""marriage works"". I wasn’t expecting this a couple of weeks ago. So, you know, when things are unexpected, it tends to... You know, it feels nicer. I didn’t have - I didn’t feel like I put too much pressure on myself in the last couple of weeks, which is a good thing. But yeah, I mean, obviously to win a Masters series on clay is a step in the right direction. It is something I have never done before, so that is good progress there. And yeah, obviously to win against Rafa on clay in a final in Spain is an extremely difficult thing to do, and I am proud that I have managed to do that. Days after being labelled overrated by his fellow players, Rickie Fowler produced the perfect response by winning golf’s Players Championship in sensational style. This is Rickie Fowler’s approach on the iconic 17th hole at TPC Sawgrass, on the way to becoming clubhouse leader at 12 under par. Sergio Garcia’s long birdie putt here at 17 put him at 12 under as well, and into a three-way playoff. Kevin Kisnerjoined the trio, and was then part of the final two, as Garcia dropped out and it went to sudden death. And Fowler won his second PGA Tour title in the same week as he and Ian Poulter were voted the most overrated players by their peers, in an anonymous survey for Sports Illustrated. In the English Premier League, champions Chelsea drew 1-1 with Liverpool- a result which means the Reds can no longer realistically qualify for the Champions League. A header from john Terry in the fifth minute put the Blues ahead, before Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard equalised just before half-time. It was a game. It was a proper game. It was not a preseason game, it was a game where both teams were trying to get a result. Was Chelsea at the top? No. But was Chelsea at the level where we showed that we want to compete, we want to win the game? I think clearly. I think we got off to an awful start, and that gives them a bit of confidence for the first 15 or 20 minutes. And then we showed the quality in that period and why they were probably champions. But I think after that, after the goal, there were some good movement and towards the end of the first half we started to create a little bit more. And after that it wasjust reinforce the mentality. We’ve started games slowly, too many season. But it took a great deal of responsibility to want the ball more in the second half and you can see that in the creativity in the team, which was much better. Queens Park Rangers were relegated back to the Championship, after just one season in the top flight. They needed a win, but lost 6-0 to Manchester City. Sergio Aguero has now scored 25 goals in the Premier League this season, to almost guarantee him self the Golden Boot. But a sad day for QPR, who sit rock bottom of the table. I think that we played very well. It’s very important, as I said before, it is not only important to win, that is the most important thing. But it is also important to win in this way, also scoring the most amount of goals, and continue with our philosophy and our style of football. There was plenty of glitz and glamour in London on Sunday night at BAFTA television awards. Amongst the winners was the BBC’s Sherlock. Our entertainment correspondent Lizo Mzimba was on the red carpet. Some of the biggest stars of the small screen were out on the red carpet, for a night honouring the very best TV. Tonight isn’t necessarily about which shows or performers are the most popular. It is about which are judged to be of the highest quality by the industry, and such recognition from their peers is of huge importance to the nominees, and particularly to the winners. Anything that I have said, I have said to the police... The Lost Honour of Christopher jefferies, the true story of how a retired teacher became engulfed in a news frenzy, after being arrested for a murder he hadn’t committed, won two awards - Best Miniseries and Best Actor, forjason Watkins. It is a brilliant script and it’s about real events and real people, and things that happened that are relevant. And it tells a story beyond just a thrilling tale, or a particular genre, it tells of real events. Also winning two awards - Marvellous, another true story, about the extraordinary life of a man called Neil Baldwin.

Don’t forget, you can get in touch with me and some of the team on Twitter. I’m @BBCNaga. Coming up injust a couple of minutes, Sally Bundock has all the latest business news in World Business Report. Good morning. Certainly no signs of any significant settled weather across the UK, but the next couple of days will be relatively quiet before we see the return of some heavy rain by Thursday. A warm start and some decent sunny spells, but the potential for that rain is there by the end of the week. That could keep the gardeners and growers happy. We have some rain around at the moment that has been drifting out of Northern Ireland and Scotland. We start our day with that rain sitting across the north of England and Wales. A relatively mild start with temperatures in double figures. As that weather front pushes south and east it will weaken substantially, so no significant rain for the Midlands and the south-east. Low pressure to the north and west, here we will keep a breezy theme. Maybe even gales on exposed north-west coasts. We start off relatively bright and sunny, a few isolated showers. Those will become more frequent into the afternoon, maybe with rumbles of thunder. If you can get out and about, make the most of the morning brightness. The cloud and rain from our dying weather front sitting across the north of England and north Wales, a few showery bits and pieces left on it but it is an improving situation here as the day continues. The Midlands and the south-east of England will start dry and sunny and it will stay like that for much of the day. Into the south-west, thicker cloud, some rain. As our weather front pushes south and east it will die off by then, as it moves into the Midlands, a band of cloud will turn the sunshine hazy. Along the south coast, Channel coasts, it will stay murky and disappointing but generally a pleasant feel. 15-18 across northern and western areas with the Midlands, into East Anglia and the south-east corner, where we have the best of the sunshine, the best of the heat with highs of 23. Sunny spells and scattered showers are the story as we go into Tuesday. the breeze will be noticeable in the Highs of 11-19. As we move into Wednesday, after a chilly start, maybe some localised frost in rural spots, we keep the sunshine. But by Thursday, it looks like the rain will arrive and some could be quite heavy, especially in the southern half of the country. That is how we start our week. Enjoy. This is BBC World News. The headlines: Eurozone finance ministers are meeting in Brussels today with Greece once again at the top of their agenda. Greece has to make a big debt repayment to the IMF tomorrow and it has had received no new loans from its international partners. Typhoon Noul has crashed ashore in the Philippines, triggering warnings of flash floods and landslides. So far, there have been no reports of casualties but officials have urged people on the northern coast to go to higher ground. Scientists studying animal mummies from ancient Egypt have discovered that many of them are little more than bundles of cloth. Researchers used X-rays to examine more than eight hundred mummies found that about a third contained no animals. A 17-year-old Melbourne teenager has appeared in a children’s court to face two terrorism-related charges. He was arrested on Friday night at his home where police allegedly found three homemade explosive devices. Those are the latest headlines from BBC World News. Now for the latest financial news with World Business Report. Deja vu. Eurogroup meets to discuss Greece. How long can the cash-strapped country go on paying its debts? And stimulating stuff. The Bank of China cuts interest rates for the third time in six months. Welcome to World Business Report. I’m Sally Bu ndock. Also in the programme we’ll hear how the victory for the UK’s Conservative Party will change economic policy. But first: Eurozone finance ministers will open another tortuous round of negotiations with Greece to try and keep it from bankruptcy and an exit from the euro. They’ve been trying to strong-arm Greece’s government into continuing with deep spending cuts and reforms to its economy. For months, the government has resisted. But its cash reserves are running dangerously low, while a series of huge debt repayments are looming, as jeremy Howell reports. Anti- austerity in action. The Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, welcomes back to work hundreds of state employed cleaning ladies laid off by the previous administration. The question is how the government can afford this given the scale of the debt repayments hanging over it. The first day of reckoning is an May the 12th when Greece’s government must repay $865 million to the International Monetary Fund. This could leave it unable to pay state salaries and pensions for the month. Greece’s European creditors are offering a lifeline. $8.1 billion of bailout money. In return, they want austerity measures, Greece has only tojune the 30th austerity measures, Greece has only to june the 30th to make austerity measures, Greece has only tojune the 30th to make a deal. After that the deal closes. Then, on July After that the deal closes. Then, on july the 20th, Greece must repay a massive $9.2 billion to the European Central bank, followed on August 20 by another $3.6 billion. Greece will only be able to pay these bills, say economists, if its political leaders can get another big bailout deal from they are imposing all sorts of antibusiness policies which are reality shock came. That’s what we’ve seen over the past three to four months. Now they have to give in, and that’s going to be extremely painful. Recently the Greek government restarted the privatisation of Athens’ port. It’s a key demand of its creditors, but shipyard workers responded with demonstrations, demanding it be kept in state hands. Every concession the government makes to the Euro group prompts fresh anger at home. joining me now is Constantine Michalos, Chairman of the Athens Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Thanks for being on the programme again. It’s important today’s negotiations go well for Greece. How do you feel Alexis Tsipras is handling these negotiations? Good morning, Sally. Well we do hope today, at the end of the Euro group meeting, there will be a positive signal, primarily to the ECB, so there can be some desperately needed funds coming into the economy. From what we’ve heard over the last few days, there have been positive signs in these discussions and these negotiations, simply because the evidence or the information that our European partners and lenders have been requesting, have now been coming through. However, if we don’t have this signal at the end of the day today, there are ministerial leaks from the Cabinet meeting that took place yesterday that they may refrain from making the payment of 718 million euros tomorrow to the IMF, which of course would change the situation altogether. It would change the situation altogether, and the losers would be probably those who look to you - the Chamber of Commerce and industry. Businesses in Greece must be really stifled by this situation. Alexis Tsipras is under mounting pressure to abandon election promises made just months ago by creditors in Europe. So how do you see displaying out? We are hoping for a political solution. There has to be a political solution to this issue that has arisen, simply because the market is completely stagnant. There is no liquidity whatsoever as a result of the exclusion of the banking system from the international money markets, and we need to restore liquidity as soon as possible. It’s the prime problem of the Greek economy at the moment. But of course, at the same time, the government needs to put forward a set of reforms that we will accept, whether it’s attached to an austerity package or a memorandum agreement. It needs to take place here in Greece. Primarily the National Insurance pension scheme, labour relations, and of course privatisation. We need to give the signal to our European partners that we mean business, and I think, with the privatisation schemes, and especially the 14 regional airports that have been tendered during the last days of the previous government, that we need to provide a positive signal to our European partners that we want to go forward. Always good to speak to you. Thank you for your time. The chairman of the Athens Chamber of Commerce and industry, a story we are keeping right across here on World Business Report. As soon as we get any news out of that meeting in Brussels, we will update you. But let’s talk about China. Rates have fallen from 6% since November as China heads towards its slowest rate of growth in nearly a quarter of a century. We have seen a chart of how things have been going for some time. How have people been responding to the news. We all want action. Is this it? You are right, a lot of people calling for exactly this kind of thing. I think many analysts will be cheered. The big picture, of course, is China’s slowing economy. We had more gloomy trade data for the month of April in the past few days showing both imports and exports falling by wider margins than many people had predicted. We have local governments, of course, still struggling with mountains of debt, and then of course we have inflation, still bumping along at stubbornly low levels, all of which gives the central bank here cause for concern, and, with people calling for aggressive action, more aggressive action, we now seem to have it. The third interest rate cut in six months. As of today, another 0.25% of the key lending rate, and many expecting we could see more, some people even suggesting we could see the interest rate fall by two or three percentage points over the next year or so, depending on how slow the economy begins to look. There are risks in all of this, of course, some people suggesting that you can have too much easing. We’ve seen the extraordinary performance of the Shanghai stock exchange over the last year or so, taking off like a rocket, and it looks as if, you know, as if China is entering a long-term period of quantitative easing of the type we have seen in Europe and America, that the authorities here will be attempting the same difficult balancing act, trying to make sure that money gets into the economy, but trying very hard to make sure it gets into the right places, the places that need it the most, the real economy, if you events that really boosted markets. A new trading week is of course a majority government elected in the United Kingdom. For British Prime Minister David Cameron it was a stunning victory and sterling strengthened and the FTSE 100 had its best day for weeks on Friday. But despite that unexpectedly decisive outcome the uncertainty is far from over. To talk us through the challenges facing David Cameron and his government I’m joined byjeremy Cook, Chief Economist at World First. Nice to see you. So there are big hurdles ahead, not least a referendum on membership of Europe. Yeah, the two main risks economists are looking at are the EU referendum, the fact that David Cameron has pledged to the electorate, and did soothe throughout the campaign, to have a referendum on membership by 2017 -- did so. Also the impact of what a newly strengthened Scottish Nationalist party will have on UK politics as a whole even the risks we had in the Scottish referendum last September. It is a majority government, which is good news from the point of business, and the real fear for markets was that we would have days of haggling between various parties to get some sort of government in place. That’s not happening, but it’s a wafer thin majority, isn’t it? It is, and speaking to businesses on Friday morning, they were saying, thank God the election is basically over now. We are not going to go through another two weeks of coalition building and squabbling, and we can get back to the UK as a whole, can get back to business. But the referendums - both referendums - are both quite existential risks for the UK economy moving forward. Certainly I saw reports over the weekend that, were the UK to leave the European Union, it would cost around 9.5% of GDP, so that’s a big risk, obviously. We saw 3000 businesses come in before the election backing the Tories. You’d expect to see 30,000 businesses backing staying within the European Union. Thank you so much for your time. There’s a lot more discussion on that subject coming up in the paper review. I will see you in a few minutes. An enquiry found the Bradford city fire was an accident probably started by a spectator dropping a cigarette into the rubbish that had accumulated in an old stand. But new claims by one man, Martin Fletcher, who lost his dad, brother and grandfather, have cast doubt on that verdict. It was a tragedy of such scale and sadness that it touched every corner of this city. 56 people were killed, 255 seriously injured. The images would not millions more. At 3:40pm on May the 11th 1985, a small fire started close to where I’m standing now. Four minutes later, all that was left of what was a wooden stand was steel and stone as the flames swept from this end to that. In these parts, they still talk about a blaze that moved more quickly than the man could walk. A new book written by a survivor who lost three generations of his family in the fire has questioned whether the blaze was indeed started by accident. But for now Martin Fletcher, who incredibly also found himself at the Hillsborough disaster, is still haunted by his memories. I’ll never have a dad again. I’ll never have a brother again, I’ll never have an uncle again. I’ll never have a grandfather again. That’s been my reality since the age of 12. That’s just the nature of what I am thousands of other people went through. Today the families of those who died willjoin former players, community leaders and survivors at a remembrance service in the city square. The passing of time may have helped to heal some of the city’s wounds but Bradford will never forget. Coming up at 6:00 on Breakfast- Bill Turnbull and Louise Minchin will have all the day’s news, business and sport. They’ll The top stories this hour. Eurozone finance ministers will shortly meet to discuss Greece’s plans for economic reform. A powerful typhoon has hit the north-east Philippines, forcing thousands to find shelter from flash floods and landslides. A Melbourne teenager has been remanded in custody after facing the children’s court charged over an alleged terrorism plot. Now it is time for our newspaper review. What is making headlines around the world? The Wall Street journal quotes a senior official who claims the International Monetary Fund is working on contingency plans with national authorities in south-eastern Europe, in case Greece fails to pay its debts, and defaults. Eastern Europe is warning the UK not to meddle with migration worker rights, as newly re-elected Prime Minister David Cameron prepares to renegotiate Britain’s EU membership. That is on the front of the Financial Times. And in the Companies and Markets section of the FT, foreign banks in London are reported to be plotting a managed retreat from operations that expose them to the UK bank levy. joining us is independent strategy adviser Kulveer Ranger. Good morning. Good morning. To you. We will not dwell on what is happening in Greece, because you have covered this a lot in World Business Report that there is a quote I find interesting. It would be foolish for anyone in the policy world not to be worried at this stage. This is the deputy director of the IMF’s Europe Department. We have been worried for a long, long time. We have, and we have been hearing a lot about this. Although the Greek story has been going off the news agenda with the election and things in Europe. This is a bit of brinkmanship. It is an unnamed source highlighting the dependency between some of the banks supporting Greece, Romania, Albania and Serbia. They are trying to just turn up the pressure as these negotiations have slowed down and are grinding along and you can see the IMF sort of trying to speed things up. It is interesting how the story has been position. I think there is a bit of pressure building up at the story needs to get moving again. It is interesting because the IMF is turning up the pressure at the same time as the government increase is saying they may not pay that bill tomorrow if today’s talks don’t go as well as hoped. It is 3-dimensional chess. Also being played through the press. For the sake of clarity and disclosure you worked with Boris johnson. sake of clarity and disclosure you worked with Borisjohnson. I did, yes. He is the Mayor of London, a Conservative, and you have been campaigning during the election with some Conservatives. Ijust want to put that out there before we start talking about this story in the Financial Times. And you are over the moon with the election result, a very narrow majority but majority nevertheless. The work begins. The biggest thing is it was an unexpected majority. All of us were discussing what might happen after the election and even as a staunch conservative we were hoping for the best and fearing the worst. Potentially negotiations, minority government, all kinds of formulas were being played out apart from a really clear majority for the Conservatives, a small but clear majority. And I think what is happening now is immediately there was an instinctive response from various parties, from various positions, especially in Europe because David Cameron has been clear that he is going to offer the British people and in our referendum in 2015. So the British people and in our referendum in 2015 that although western European leaders, and it shows Angela Merkel being very positive to this result -- in-out referendum. Italy and others, this is highlighting the slight concern in Eastern Europe, Poland, Hungary, and others, where one of the big issues is, and for David Cameron to deal with, is the free movement of people which has been an issue throughout the selection. When it comes to renegotiating EU membership, David Cameron always made very clear that this was going to be the basis for the referendum -- this election. He wants Britain to stay in the EU however when you hear from other leaders are at this term redline. Lines that will not be crossed. And Poland’s Europe Minister says when it comes to immigration our lines are well-known. Others say immigration our lines are well- known. Others say they will be no negotiation. I think, let’s be clear. The whole conversation about migration and free movement of people is a big issue, but if we just put that to one side, there are lots of various other issues and particularly about UK opt out, that David Cameron has space to discuss. The electorate has been concerned about immigration, that has been a massive campaign issue in from the Germans and others that they economic unity in Europe and fairness, in how people in their nationstates see their welfare systems being used. I think that has been the concern for the electorate, which David Cameron will look to find a path through as he sets out the framework for this renegotiation. One of the other issues that was quite topical last week, priorto issues that was quite topical last week, prior to the election, as well, was what banks are paying in terms of bank levies in the city of London. And the companies and markets section highlights this today. It is quoting senior figures within the industry who are saying that foreign banks now operating in the city are thinking about their retreat, as it were. What do you make of this story and the scenario? Well, I think this has already been highlighted in advance of the election in the UK where people like HSBC had been indicating that they had been looking at potentially moving their global head office out of the city of London. I think now that there is some clarity over the political landscape in the UK, we will see banks taking another look at theirs. And it was... It was David Cameron’s government, albeit a coalition, that put the bank levy up in the Budget. You know, in March. That cost HSBC and others quite a bit more money and that is why this whole issue is on perhaps. Does all impact of the credibility of London both as an economically vibrant base for the banks to work but also a safe and secure market. Briefly, I know you want to move on, but how do you when you are working with Borisjohnson in the Mayor’s offers, how do you marry the two? Keeping the banks happy because it brings in so much money to our economy, but also pleasing the rest of the electorate out there who are really cross with these banks? I think you have hit the nail on the head. That is the magic of having to walk that line, saying the golden goose... Because the City of London is a golden goose for the United Kingdom, the amount of revenue and tax it brings in for the Exchequer, and we want to make sure it is vibrant and it is an attractive market to play but we want to make sure they pay their fair way, there is regulation that stops certain unfair trading going on. But I think we need to look at this and we need to see this play out over the next six months. And the chief executive of the British banking Association is commenting about taking views and saying that they are looking at potential moves. But again, there is some brinkmanship here from banks. There is a lot of things that happen immediately after the election, our people putting their message out first and then seeing what negotiations will happen, I think that as a starting point on that. We will skip over the China Daily, interest rates will go down and will continue to go down. That is the prediction, isn’t it? There is, although there is a comment about how it might impact things in a couple of months, the real concern is GDP which could hit the real concern is GDP which could have VE Day celebrations, or commemorations I should say, remembering 70 years ago the declaration that the Allied war was over in Europe. There were fly past is, there were great parades and he spent the day in London as well. I did, I think after this country has been caught up and especially broadcasters and people like myself in the general election, in the bigger things than the sacrifices and VE Day was a great day to put everything into context and I actually had a lovely picnic yesterday afternoon, a moment to relax in St james’s yesterday afternoon, a moment to relax in Stjames’s Park, I sat there with a group of friends, there was an Italian, French, German, and as thoughts turn to this we thought well, this is what everyone fought for, this kind of unity and friendship that we can all sit there now and just the kind of peace and happiness between us and enjoy the quality of life and see a brighter future for Europe which is whatever body wants to see going forward. It is the legacy that those brave men and women left future generations. Thank you very much. Sally and I will see you very soon. Have a good day. Goodbye. Hello there. It looks as though our week ahead will have something for everyone. If you want the quiet weather, we start our week like that, and it will be quite warm as well, with some sunny spells. However, if you are a gardener or a grower and you want further rain for the gardens, well, there will be plenty of that perhaps by Thursday. We have got some rain around at the moment, stretching its way out of Scotland and Northern Ireland, and that will be drifting south-east. It will be a relatively mild start to Monday morning as well, temperatures widely into double figures. Our weather front continues to push south and east, weakening all the time, but always an area of low pressure to the north-west keeps the winds a feature into Scotland and Northern Ireland, and it will bring with it further showers as the day continues. But it will be a relatively quiet, bright start across Northern Ireland and Scotland. Some sunshine coming through. Showers should be fairly isolated first thing in the morning. The winds will continue to strengthen, and the showers more of a feature into the afternoon. There is our weather front, then, just moving out of the Scottish borders into the north of England and Wales. Still a little bit of rain on it, but conditions here will improve as the day continues. The odd spot or two of rain into the south-west too. For the Midlands and the south-east corner, maybe starting off bright with some sunshine coming through, a pleasant enough start to the day. Now, as the day continues, our weather front sinks south and east, weakening. just a band of cloud as it pushes into the Midlands, turning the sunshine somewhat hazy, and maybe along the south coast we could see a little bit of mist clinging here. Behind it, sharp showers and stronger winds developing into the far north, some of those showers heavy and possibly thundery. But it will still be relatively warm, 15-18 degrees. Highest values are likely across the Midlands, eastern England and south-east England. 22,23 degrees not out the question. The exception perhaps along the Channel coast, where we keep that cloud here. Now, as we go into Tuesday, the most straightforward description for Tuesday, sunny spells and scattered showers, particularly first thing in the morning. Those showers should become fairly isolated into the afternoon, staying up into the north-west, where the winds will remain a feature, highs of 11-19, so just that little bit fresher. Then as we move through Tuesday night with those clearer skies into Wednesday morning, things will turn a little chilly, particularly in rural spots. And certainly worth bearing in mind if you have put some tender plants into the garden, there is the potential for being a frost. But Wednesday again will be bright with decent sunshine before the rain arrives on Thursday and some of it will turn quite heavy, particularly into the south-east corner. That’s it, enjoy your week.

Later on BBC London: A woman’s body has been found in a suitcase in the Grand Union Canal. Plus, it’s been a warm couple of days, but is there more of the same to come? Your local and national forecast is coming up. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. David Cameron’s post election Cabinet has been taking shape this morning. Sajid javid is one of the biggest winners - he’s replaced the ousted Liberal Democrat Vince Cable as the new Business Secretary. Several women have also been promoted to the Cabinet- Amber Rudd is Energy and Climate Change Secretary and Priti Patel will attend Cabinet as Employment minister. The Mayor of London, Borisjohnson, who is back in the Commons, has not been given a ministerial post but he will be a member of Mr Cameron’s political cabinet. Our political correspondent, Robin Brant has been watching the comings and goings in Downing Street. This is what success looks like. The Prime Minister gathered with some of his MPs for a Tory team photo outside Parliament this morning. Most probably still pinching themselves to check the surprise victory was not a dream. The day started with new arrivals for some of the topjobs. He is in, just. Borisjohnson now London of the topjobs. He is in, just. Boris johnson now London Mayor and an MP will attend Cabinet every fortnight. But he does not get a paid post. The son of a bus driver, Sajid javid moves up. He paid post. The son of a bus driver, Sajidjavid moves up. He is Sajid javid moves up. He is now Business Secretary. Most significantly, there are more women at the top. Nicky Morgan stays on in education and get used to seeing and hearing more of these two, Priti Patel moves to the number two job at welfare and Amber Rudd is now in the Cabinet. The big jobs around the Cabinet table are not changing. From the weekend we know that Iain Duncan Smith stays as welfare secretary. Tina Stour will be leader in the Lords. Theresa May is still Home Secretary. Philip Hammond remains Foreign Secretary. Michael Fallon stays in charge of defence Chancellor and de facto Minister is George Osborne. So, David step. The focus will shift quickly to what goes on Remember, the Conservative majority is a pretty slim one and of the prime list wants to deliver on all of those promises, he will have to make sure all of his MPs stay onside. Few expected victory on this scale. Now comes the hard bit. David Cameron knows he have to deliver. His car ruled with -- Cameron knows he have to deliver. His car ruled with -- board with energy as he left Parliament. He met his backbench MPs and laid out his priorities. Reports say he was applauded even before he walked into the committee room. In the new era, one MP tweeted a picture from inside. There is no doubt this is the honeymoon period for now. It is great to welcome so many new colleagues. The sense of goodwill towards the Prime Minister and it felt really reciprocated as well, I think bodes very well for the coming years. Some will always remain loyal to the man inside NumberTen to the man inside Number Ten but with any referendum, more welfare cuts and keeping the EU together to come, David Cameron’s leadership will be tested. Someone once the Prime -- will be tested. Someone once the Prime -- celebrations to go on. Don’t expect the primers do to drink all of this champagne though. -- Prime Minister. The Labour party has also been making changes to its shadow cabinet. Among the appointments is Chris Leslie who is replacing Ed Balls as Shadow chancellor rand Hilary Benn who replaces Douglas Alexander, as shadow foreign secretary. The MP for Tottenham, David Lammy, has become the latest prominent Labour figure to rule out standing in the party’s leadership election. So far only one Labour MP - Liz Kendall- has confirmed that she will run in the leadership contest. Let’sjoin Christian Fraser now for more details. There will inevitably be a period of soul-searching within Labour and perhaps weeks of bitter arguments of the party within the next six weeks? Before be contest be held in September at the party conference? The National evicted committee will meet on Wednesday this week. The caretaker leader Harriet Harman seemed to be suggesting this morning that she favours the longer game. We know this is a very bad defeat. There is no getting away from that. There is no point everyonejumping to conclusions. Yes, we have to have a proper debate but it is my responsibility to make sure the facts are brought out. The rule to elect the leader have changed. It will be one member, one vote, as opposed to the electoral college system which was used to elect Ed Miliband. They will have a big say in the unions which plays to the advantage of the Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham, very popular with the unions and also the grass roots. Another favourite, Yvette Cooper, the Shadow Home Secretary. Some said in the past the only problems for her running worthy ambitions of her husband Ed Balls. That problem disappeared last week. Another front runner is Chuka Umunna. There was criticism for him this weekend, he said Labour had not appeal to business and aspirational voters. Among the others, Liz Kendall, the shadow Health Minister, seen as many as the flag carrier for the Blairites and a former adviser to Harriet Harman. The shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt who said this weekend it is time for a brutal postmortem. One man who will not be taking part is this man, Danjarvis,15 years in the Paras, the member now for Barnsley Central. He raised his own two children after the death of his wife from cancer. He says he’s not prepared to sacrifice his family’s interest at the altar of the Labour leadership, which perhaps tells you how difficult and demanding this will be. Apprentice star and peer Lord Sugar has announced that he is quitting the Labour party. He said his resignation was accepted after he said he had lost confidence in Labour during the last 12 months due to their ""negative business policies and the general anti-enterprise concepts."" He will continue in his role in the House of Lords. Let’s cross over to Westminster and our Assistant Political Editor Norman Smith. You have been casting your eye over this reshuffle. What has caught it? Well, many reshuffles involve little more than a light dusting of the Cabinet table, the repositioning of the odd plant pot. This is not one of those, it is a radical reshuffle designed to set out some key political messages. Message number one, the return of blue-collar conservatism, which had its heyday during Mrs T, and the attempts to forge a more grounded working-class conservatism. We have seen the appointment of an MP Robert Halfon as deputy chairman of the party. He is pretty much the embodiment of Essex Tory dumb. The hope is by making him deputy chairman of the party that will put rocket boosters under blue-collar conservatism. Message never two is we are listening. All of those appointed by and large good performers on the media. They are people who can sell a message, people who can engage with the public. Top of the list is Borisjohnson. The hope is he can inject some sunshine after the years of austerity. And many of those being promoted with men and the hope is to have a cabinet which more reflect the modern world than it does the playing fields of Eton. This is a reshuffle designed to recast the image of the Tory party and also to be set the course of Mr Cameron’s second administration. Postmortems in the Labour Party and several challenges facing them? several challenges facing them ? Striking several challenges facing them? Striking the contrast between this reshuffle and the Labour reshuffle. More awake than a new dawn. Labour know they are entering a long dark night of the soul. In that context, it was interesting to see one possible leadership contender Dan jarvis saying today, I cannot do it. I? Because of his family and the price they would pay. He knows this will be a huge long slow possibly painful task that could take not just five years but ten years. An enormous challenge now awaits who will take over the Labour Party. Thank you. The Liberal Democrat party have begun their search for a new leader. Nick Clegg’s resignation on Friday means there will now be a leadership election. But with the party reduced from 57 MPs tojust eight, there are fewer options. Former party president Tim Farron is among those expected to run, alongside Norman Lamb, who was a minister in the last government. Ukip are also looking for a new leader. The party will meet today to discuss the election result and the resignation of Nigel Farage, after he failed to gain the parliamentary seat of Thanet South. Anyone can put their name forward to become the party leader, as long as they have 50 signatures and pay a deposit. There will then be a ballot of all party members. The SNP’s 56 MPs have arrived in Westminster today, for the first time since the party’s sweeping election gains. Angus Robertson, who is expected to be reappointed as Westminster group leader, said they would be ""the strongest voice possible for Scotland"". Our Scotland correspondent Laura Bicker reports. They are famous to some, but to others, this group of Scottish MPs are unknown. A 20-year-old get a free pass at Westminster as they fight to control more of Scotland’s finances and they are facing a Conservative majority. I did think Scotland’s position can be reduced to pure arithmetic. We teetered on the brink of leaving the union last year. Now we are coming down here to become representatives. Hell hath no fury. They knew what they want to do but do they know how to get into their office? As with every Thursday, things do not always go smoothly. This is new territory for the SNP. Having achieved more seats than any other party in Scotland’s history, the MPs will take up places normally reserved for the Liberal Democrats. Having once fought to leave the UK, with the help of the youngest MPs in 1667, they will now officially become its third largest party. And you can get the latest on the continuing fallout from the general election, including David Cameron’s new Cabinet appointments at bbc.co.uk/news. Controversial proposals for dealing with the thousands of migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean from North Africa are due to be put forward by the European Commission this week. They include plans to set quotas for the number of refugees to be taken in by member states. More than 18,000 people have died already this year, attempting to get to Europe. The Home Office says the UK will oppose any non-voluntary quota. Gavin Lee reports. This is the uncomfortable reality that Europe faces. More than 60,000 people have tried to cross the Mediterranean from Africa this year, according to the UN. 1800 have died. After one single tragedy last month when migrants drowned, an emergency summit was called. It led to the search and rescue operation being increased and the plan to tackle the traffickers. I think is right for Britain to step forward, for the Royal Navy to play a role. They will be saving lives, not only offering asylum in the UK but taking them to Italy and other nearby countries. This week, the European Commission is proposing that each country takes in a set number of migrants, a quote that Italy and Greece say they are struggling to cope with. A number of Northern European countries like Britain are locked in to get involved. Britain has the legal right to opt out of decisions of this kind that concern asylum seekers. They can also opt in or make a voluntary contribution to be seen to be a fair layer or to show some sense of humanitarian solidarity with the rest. Another proposal being put forward by the EU is to lessen the need for traffickers. The UN is calling on the EU to resettle 20,000 migrants in the next five years. In next month’s EU summit, leaders will debate the plans. For David Cameron, it is another issue which could become a defining marker of his legacy. Private postal business Whistl, formerly known as TNT, has suspended its door-to-door delivery service in London, Liverpool and Manchester and is consulting 2,000 workers on redundancy. The move follows a decision last month by a potential investment partner NOT to fund its expansion plans. With me now is our Business Correspondent john Moylan. A lot of people will not have heard of Whistl, what is it? It was formerly known as TNT Post. It is a rival to Royal Mail. In recent years it has been delivering its own mail in places like London, Liverpool and Manchester, 2 million items a week. It has been expanding incredibly fast. Some people thought it was expanding so fast it would affect parts of Royal Mail. Royal Mail offers the so-called universal service. Today, the company out of nowhere has said it is expending its service and there is the risk of redundancies. What has gone wrong? It was in talks with a back to put a lot of money into the business and there was a view that it would lose money at the beginning and it needed to get to a certain scale to make a profit. That will not happen any time soon. The company is saying it is reviewing the viability of an end to end postal service. Crucially, many of these staff were not on the same conditions as Royal Mail staff. They were on zero hours contracts. Royal Mail is the big winner today. Their shares are up. Is this a setback or is it the end of the road for the whole idea of competition for delivery of mail. Thank you. Our top story this lunchtime: David Cameron unveils his new Cabinet- with some familiar - and not so familiar - names in key posts. And still to come, what’s really inside this ancient Egyptian mummy. Later on BBC London. A woman’s body has been found in a suitcase in the Grand Union Canal. Plus, it’s been a warm few days but is there more of the same to come? Your local and national forecast is coming up. It’s a year since pro-Russian separatists declared independence in the cities of Donetsk and Luhansk in the east of Ukraine. The war there has now been going on for 18 months. So far more than 6,000 people have died during the conflict despite two ceasefires. It’s thought that nearly a million people have been forced from their homes, nearly 120-thousand of them children. Many of them have fled to neighbouring countries, the majority to Russia. Our correspondent in Donetsk, Tom Burridge, has this special report on a fragile ceasefire and an uncertain future. The war on Europe’s eastern edge is now one-year-old. And Ukraine’s soldiers continue to accuse Russia of fuelling this conflict. In a region where people are bitterly divided. This war will finish when Russian troops will go away fI’oTT’I oUI’ COUI’1tI’y. For me, I think that I don’t have enemies in Donetsk, I have a lot of friends but now I can visit these friends and some friends shoot to me but now I have to shoot them. Months of bombing has driven countless families from their homes. For those who can’t leave, the horror of living next to a frontline drags on. The war has robbed 76-year-old Ivan of his pension, killed his wife and sister-in-law. He now lives on his own and food is scarce. There were bombs, bombs, bombs, he says. So many his wife had a heart attack. He explained how his sister-in-law was killed by shrapnel. We feel abandoned, we can’t go anywhere because of the checkpoints. His road leads to the front line which has not moved significantly in nearly three months. Ukraine is building up its Army after years of neglect. A country that’s lost a chunk of its territory to its Russian-backed enemy to the east. For now at least, this war seems to have reached a tit-for-tat deadlock. On this side Ukraine, with its economy in trouble, it seems to lack the money and the will to go on the offensive. But just down the road from here, pro-Russian fighters, they know if they attack and take more territory from Ukraine, Ukraine’s allies in America and Europe might become more deeply involved. In the meantime, in the suburbs of the region’s main city Donetsk, this is the sound mid-morning where even the roof of the local hospital has been hit. Shrapnel ripped through this operating theatre. Here in rebel territory, the health system is cut off from the rest of Ukraine. The hospital relies on aid agencies for its drugs. This woman was a nurse, now she’s a patient. A bus she was travelling on was bombed. Getting independence from Ukraine would have been worth all this if so many people and children had not died. Five-year-old Yarislav here for a scan asked us when the banging would stop. The truth is, no-one knows and more immediate questions are if or when this conflict will escalate again. The bells at Bradford City Hall tolled at 11 o’clock this morning, 56 times, one for each of the people who died when fire ripped through a stand during a match at Valley Parade 30 years ago today. The blaze broke out during the club’s 1985 match against Lincoln City, killing 54 Bradford City fans, two Lincoln fans and injuring many more. Hundreds of fans, and current and former players, paid tribute at a remembrance service in the city’s Centenary Square. Richard Conway is there for us. It may have been 30 years since that fire, but for the bereaved and for the proud people of this city, the healing process is still ongoing. Today, they gathered to reflect and crucially to remember. A toll of the Town Hall bell for every life lost on that fateful day in 1985. Forfamilies who every life lost on that fateful day in 1985. For families who watched loved ones go off to watch a football game, the memories of that fateful day are still raw. The pain doesn’t go away. 30 years on, the number of people here today speaks for itself. The fire only lasted for 270 seconds, but spread with such ferocity that many were simply unable to escape the inferno. The inquiry that followed attributed to the cause to a dropped cigarette or match. Those present determined the memory should live on. At times I think it’s been the forgotten disaster in sport and that upsets me as well because it should never ever be forgotten. A new book by Martin Fletcher who, at the age of 12 survived the fire, but who lost three generations of his family, has raised questions over the official cause. Like others, he too is still coming to terms with events. I’ll never have a dad, a brother again or an uncle again and, never have a grandfather again. That’s been the reality since the age of 12. That’s the nature of what I and thousands of others went through. Time may have passed but by standing together, a city and its people today renewed their motivation to never forget. today renewed their motivation to neverforget. People never forget. People have been coming along to the memorial to pay their own tributes, lay floi flowers and take a moment to remember the tragedy. As for the families and survivors, they have moved on to the staid yawn where they’ll have a private ceremony and a chance again to reflect on the events 30 years ago. Injust underan hour, Eurozone finance ministers meet in Brussels with Greece once again at the top of the agenda. The Greek government needs more cash to help pay off its debts, with the International Monetary Fund due to be paid 750 million euros tomorrow. Our Europe Correspondent Chris Morris is in Brussels. The rest of the eurozone has been saying for months that if the new Greek government led by the left coalition is to get the additional funds, it needs to implement further programmes of economic reform. The trouble is, the reforms will include the kind of austerity measures that Syriza was elected to overturn, so it’s stalemate. I’ve come back from Athens and, while life there goes on, everyone knows the clock is ticking. Dock workers on strike in Athens, anxious that the radical left-wing Syriza government many of them helped elect may be forced to break a promise not to privatise the port in order to raise much-needed money. This is a gentle reminder that as well as pressure from the EU and IMF, there’s pressure from the street not to give up too easily on the things they promised to do. They have to be loyal to the declaration and to their promises before the elections. As much as possible. We know that the pressure is huge, but there are certain points that they cannot go back. It’s a huge dilemma for ministers negotiating with Greece’s international creditors. Other countries in the eurozone want Greece to accept a deal that would look like the old bail out agreement. But a government elected to bring austerity to an end says it has to be able to offer something different. Obviously, that means we’ll have compromise in other areas and obviously the final agreement nobody will see their complete face in it, because if you can, you haven’t compromised. If they get nothing much from Europe, pressure will grow to put the results of the protracted negotiations to a referendum. With some calling openly for a default on Greek debt and exit from the euro, the result would not be a foregone conclusion. One Syriza MP told me Greece is being forced to negotiate with a knife held to its throat because it’s very close to running out of money. I’m told it will be able to make a debt repayment to the IMF tomorrow, but without further funding, it will struggle to pay the bills at the end of this month. Scientists have discovered that many animal mummies from ancient Egypt are actuallyjust bundles of cloth stuffed with sticks and mud. Researchers in Manchester believe there was a huge demand for the religious offerings, which may have outstripped supply. Our Science Correspondent Rebecca Morelle reports. Wrapped in layer upon layer of cloth. Offerings to ancient Egypt’s Gods. These animal mummies are more than 2,000 years old. And now their secrets are finally being revealed in the largest study of its kind. To study these animal mummies, archaeologists used to have to unwrap them, a process that completely destroyed the fragile contents. Now though, scanning technology makes it easy to look insideth side. Scientists have been surprised by what they have found. In Manchester, hundreds of mummies are being examined. Some hold a rich bounty. Inside is a two metre long Nile crocodile revealed in remarkable detail. It’s got the nice modelled face with a little role of linen for the nose and two eyes. Others. .. Ooh. Not an awful lot. That is the answer to that. Contain hardly any animal at all. Vertebrae. And these empty mummies are common. There have been some surprises, we knew not all contained what we’d expect them to, but we found around a third don’t contain any animal material at all so no skeletal remains. The answer may lie here in Egypt’s ancient tombs. This place alone holds two million mummified birds. 30 similar tombs have been uncovered, containing an estimated 75 million animals. There’s evidence they were mass bred then killed. But even this might not have been enough. In that period, demand really outstripped supply. There was a case of whether weren’t enough animals, but pilgrims, the people buying them, believed they were getting some sense of the gift of the Gods. The scans are Goving us a chance to look at the animals up close and to probe a process that had become big business. One perhaps where sometimes short cuts were made.

Andy Murray’s preparations for the French Open are going well. He’s won his second title on clay, and his second in a week beating Rafael Nadal in the final in Madrid. It’s his first victory over the Spaniard on clay. Nadal has now dropped down the World rankings to number7, his lowest position for 10 years. Alex Gulrajani has the details. As Andy Murray told the world marriage works for him, weeks after his wedding, he is now doing things he hasn’t managed before. Rafael Nadal, the king of clay had the better of Murray as a bachelor. But as a married man, Murray is a different proposition, taking the first set with surprising ease. The British number one, of course, is accustomed to Spanish clay. As a teenager he trained in Barcelona. Now with the extra bounce in his step, he moved across the red surface and produced the kind of performance more often seen from the Spaniard. Nadal on his favourite surface in his home country was beaten inside 90 minutes. Murray will travel to Rome. Then Paris and Roland Garros and the newly married Murray will be hoping the honeymoon continues in the city of romance. And finally, Scotland’s UN Murray announced his retirement from international rugby. He played in the 2009 British and Lions tour of South Africa and ended his career and against Ireland in the final game of the Six Nations. He is Scotland’s most capped prop. That is all the sport. Simon, Scotland’s most capped prop. That is allthe sport. Simon, back all the sport. Simon, back to you. Thank you.

It was also a successful night for Ant and Dec, who won two awards including best entertainment show. Lizo Mzimba reports. Many of entertainment’s most famous names gathered on the red carpet for the evening’s events. No wonder Grande dominated the ceremony. It was a strong night for BBC drama. Two awards for best single drama for Marvellous. The popular show followed the story of Neil Baldwin, Amman with learning difficulties who became Pittman with Stoke city football club. It has been great to be here tonight. I thank the Lord for what he has done for me. There were also two awards for The Lost Honour of Christopherjefferies, the true story of a retired teacher falsely accused of murder and engulfed in a press frenzy. It is very satisfying to be voted by your peers. It is a great thing. And two awards for Ant and Dec. We are really chuffed with this. The radio Times audience award went to one of the most popular shows, Sherlock. And a special award went to Clive james, honouring the huge creative contribution he has made to British TV. I will sign off by saying thank you so much for this award and I have at last realised who that is. They poured molten gold on a wax facemask of Benedict Cumberbatch. Time for a look at the weather now. Good afternoon. Today’s weather is the warmest of the week. There will be some decent weather to come. There will be some dry days. There will be some passing showers around. Somewhat weather on the way for Thursday. around. Somewhat weather on the way forThursday. If for Thursday. If you want some soaking rain on the garden you may get some of that. We have this area of low pressure Ivan in this weakening area of low pressure south through England and Wales. Showers for Scotland and Ireland. A band of cloud in the south-east. There are some showers running through eastern parts of Scotland. Catch a shower and it could be heavy or thundery. Remember the gusty winds. One or two showers for Northern Ireland and the North of England. For the south-west of England some spots of rain and temperatures into the high teens. Towards the mid-20s in parts of the South. Some misty niss along the south coast. Into tonight and eventually more cloud comes back to parts of southern England and Wales with some patchy, mostly light rain. We continue with the few showers running through the northern half of the UK. Some of us tomorrow morning, across southern areas will start cloudy and damp. Bear with it, it will brighten up. For North Wales, the Midlands and North Woods, there will be some showers around again, maybe heavy, possibly thundery. Gusty winds. Temperatures tomorrow down on what we are getting today by several degrees in places. As the winds eased tomorrow night, it will turn out to be chilly. Gardeners take note of that. There will be a touch of frost around. Wednesday looks to be a fine day, variable cloud, not clear blue sky, some occasional sunshine around. In this comes in for Thursday. A bit of uncertainty about the exact track but it looks like it is targeting England and Wales with most of the rail Thursday. A cold day for some of us to come. It looks like Northern Ireland and Scotland will miss most of that rain. By the time get to Friday it is looking mainly dry. You can find out more on the website. Thank you. A reminder of our top story: David Cameron has announced more appointments to his new cabinet. Women feature strongly in the team. Speculation is mounting over who will replace Ed Miliband as Labour leader. Now on BBC One time for the news where you are. Good afternoon. Welcome to BBC London News. I’m Victoria Hollins. The body of a woman has been found in a suitcase in the Grand Union canal in Maida Vale. Police don’t yet know how long the body had been there, but they are treating the death as suspicious. Alpa Patel has more. The suitcase was discovered yesterday afternoon along this stretch of the Grand Union Canal, about 40 metres along here. We understand local police, divers and firefighters were involved in the operation. When they pulled the suitcase out, they discovered a body inside. We don’t know the identity of the person or the age but we do understand it is that of a woman. We have been talking to local people who have spoken of their shock and anguish at the discovery. They say it is very, very unusual. It is quite surprising and a bit scary. We walk down here a lot at work and I find it a bit intimidating and scary. This path has been closed off for the last 24 hours and is not due to be reopened any time soon. Police say they will be able to give us more information when they have the results of a postmortem which is due to be given later. The Tottenham MP David Lammy has told the BBC that he will not be standing in the next Labour leadership contest. Mr Lammy had suggested yesterday that he would be keen to run for the Labour Party’s top job. But speaking on the Daily Politics a short time ago, he appeared to have backtracked. ~ Iam not I am not going to be standing for the Labour leadership. I think we need a leader who can win back the Midlands, that understands Scotland as well as the south. Actually, we need to do better in London. My strengths are in London and the South and therefore I want to be the Labour candidate for mayor. Meanwhile, the tooting MP and former shadowjustice Secretary, Sadiq Khan, has resigned from the shadow cabinet. He has written to the acting leader Harriet Harman. He said it would be an opportunity for others to take on a role. Most people living in urban areas think there should be stricter rules on flying drones, according to study by the British Airlines Pilots Association. Despite being used effectively to capture stunning images, many believe the misuse of drones should be more tightly controlled. ",,
84,BBC News 24,11-may-2015,BBC News at Six,18:00,30 mins,True,"A new-look and entirely Conservative Cabinet for David Cameron, with more women, and a role for Borisjohnson. Celebrations with the new crop of Tory MPs, as Mr Cameron makes new appointments to the top table. Secretary of State for energy and climate change. Amber Rudd is in, so is Priti Patel, a total of nine women will now attend Cabinet. No department for Boris johnson to run, but he will attend separate ""political"" cabinet meetings. David Miliband in an exclusive BBC interview criticises his brother Ed’s leadership and that of Gordon Brown. Gordon and then Ed allowed themselves to be portrayed as moving backwards from the principles of aspiration and inclusion. He’s back at the top, Nigel Farage stays Ukip leader after the party refuses to let him resign. We’ll be looking at the first day back at Westminster for intake, new and old. Also tonight: Talks over what should be done with migrants crossing the Med, EU leaders discuss a quota system for settling them. From number six in the world to champions, that’s the hope for the England women’s Football World Cup squad. Tonight on BBC London. Back to Westminster for the Mayor, but Boris johnson describes his new role in the political cabinet as a ‘non job’. And dumped in the Grand Union Canal police discover a woman’s body in a suitcase. in hospital, after a stock car racing accident. Good evening. Four days after his decisive election win, David Cameron has been completing his Cabinet reshuffle, with several new names joining the top table to replace those Liberal Democrats who lost their seats. Amber Rudd became energy Secretary, the most high-profile of women promoted to ministerial office. London Mayor and newly-elected MP Borisjohnson was not made a minister, but will attend separate Tory political cabinet meetings. Not all, but they are here, nonetheless. More than 70 freshly elected Conservative MPs with the man who led them to victory. Nervous, expectant. Their success in getting elected is why David Cameron is back in Downing Street. LAUGHTER That work for him and forming a new cabinet. More women to be appointed including Amber Rudd, former investment banker, journalist who was promoted to... Secretary of State for energy and climate change. Liz Truss might have had trouble getting into number ten but no trouble getting back into the Cabinet as Environment Secretary. This is all about renewal, making progress. Last time we had to recover the economy. We had to get things in place. We have made progress. This was a reshuffle designed to show the changing face of the Conservative Party. The son of a bus strike, Sajid javid the former banker, was permitted to Business Secretary. It is an importantjob. Where he will have to calm business fears about an EU referendum Robert Halfon, a campaigning from Essex becomes deputy Tory Chairman, leading vehicle to party workers. At ease on social media and mainstream media. Others also considered good TV performers include the former presenter Anna Seabury who becomes small-business minister and Priti small- business minister and Priti Patel, small-business minister and Priti Patel, who is made employment Minister, both of whom will be able to attend Cabinet without being full members. There were some surprises, john Whittingdale a former aide to Margaret Flack Chad becomes culture Secretary. A candid critic of the BBC at times and he can oversee the future of the corporation. Despite these moves, most of the cabinet remains unchanged, jeremy Hunt stays at health, giving the NHS some continuity. justine Greening stays at International development and Theresa Villiers remains at Northern Ireland. There was no extra job for this man, he still has a year as London mayor that he gets the right to attend Cabinet, when it discusses party matters. Are you happy with your new post, if I can call it that? Provided you don’t call it a job. What is it? It is a role. Some in Downing Street were savouring the victory with a glass or two, David Cameron celebrated with his party in the Commons. The Conservative MPs packed into a meeting room down there and they were euphoric, they are in powerand there and they were euphoric, they are in power and governing alone and when the Prime Minister walked in a bind the tables for almost a minute and he told them they had to govern as one nation Conservatives, bringing the union together. But with such a small majority, he wants to govern effectively, he will have to keep his party together. For now, they are new and loyal. Are you nervous? A bit, there is a huge amount to do and we have a lot to learn. Brilliant. What matters to him is that they keep up with him. As the Labour Party pours over the reasons for its resounding defeat, Ed Miliband’s brother David this evening made clear, in an exclusive interview with the BBC, that he will not go in for the party leadership. He criticised the leadership and described the result as devastating. The man who was narrowly beaten by his younger brother in 2010 criticised Ed Miliband’s leadership, saying that both he and former Prime Minister Gordon Brown had ""allowed themselves to be portrayed as moving backwards"" from the key principals of a successful political project. David Miliband says he remains in touch with his brother and also ruled himself out of standing for the leadership of the Labour Party. He was speaking to our North America correspondent Nick Bryant. Since arriving in New York City, David Miliband has kept what is called a Trappist vow of silence on British politics. But this morning he spoke for the first time with candour and criticism about the devastating election result for Labour. I think there’s absolutely no point in blaming the electorate. Any suggestion that they didn’t ""get it"" is wrong. They didn’t want what was being offered. I think that both in 2010 and in 2015 Gordon and then Ed allowed themselves to be portrayed as moving backwards from the principles of aspiration and inclusion that’s at the absolute heart of any successful progressive political project. The implication of what you’re saying is that, under the leadership of your brother, the Labour Party went too far to the left. The choice for us is very, very clear. Either we build on what Labour achieved in government after 1997, and we have a chance to succeed or we abandon it and we fail. That’s what happened in 2010 and 2015 and mustn’t happen again. So is he now the man to lead the party? I’m clearly not a candidate in this leadership election. I’m here in New York. I’m running a global charity that’s delivering aid to millions of people around the world. The commitment I have to the job I have got does not change as a result of the election. The two Miliband brothers embraced when Ed beat David to the Labour leadership in 2010. But they’ve had a chillier arm’s-length relationship since then. So how are brotherly relations now? I’m very happy to say we remain in touch. Obviously, I think that many of the attacks on him were unpleasant and unfair and I think he dealt with them with enormous dignity and with courage. I have always said that I will keep our private conversations private, but I’ve also also said you remain brothers for life and that’s something that has to be kept. Did Labour sow the seeds of its defeat back in 2010 when it decided to let Ed Miliband as leader, rather than David Miliband? To be utterly honest for my own sanity there’s no point trying to press the rewind button in life. You don’t get second chances at things. You don’t get to rewind the tape and I think it’s important not to fall into that trap. David Miliband claims he didn’t agonise over the decision not to seek the leadership. It was straightforward. But he hasn’t ruled out some future return to British politics. What he calls a soap opera may not be over yet. Our Political Editor Nick Robinson is in Westminster for us. Quite strong stuff, how significant is it that he waded in? Forfive years we have had to guess what David Miliband thought and not any more, even during the election he said the bare minimum to endorse his party and to endorse his brother. Now we know. He thinks his brother, Ed, took the Labour Party to far to the left and that his brother abandoned new Labour when he should have built on it and he thinks his brother, Ed, abandoned the aspiring people, those who want to get on in life rather than addressing them. We know one other thing from that interview with my colleague. He may not be running in this next leadership election, but he sure as hell wants a role in the future of the Labour Party. The make up of the cabinet, what does it say about the government David Cameron will lead? At first, it looked more like a reappointment than a reshuffle, didn’t it? Minister after minister was kept in their old jobs, more than half the Cabinet have kept their old post. Particularly those in the most important posts at the top of the government. Yet, it would be a mistake to the only continuity and not change. The dramatic change is this, no Liberal Democrats in that cabinet. There is no Deputy Prime Minister. There is no quad. David Cameron and George Osborne. Forfive years David Cameron and George Osborne. For five years they had to negotiate every policy and every announcement, every decision when Nick Clegg and Danny Alexander of the Lib Dems need to do that no longer -- Danny Alexander of the Lib Dems need to do that no longer -- with Nick Clegg. This is a Tory cabinet unbound. The early question we don’t know the answer to is how different will it be now they can do what they want? -- the only question. Nigel Farage has had his resignation as Ukip leader rejected by the party’s ruling committee. Mr Farage had announced he’d stand down on Friday when he failed to win a seat at the election. The party’s chairman, Steve Crowther, said he believed the election campaign had been a great success. Our Political Correspondent Carole Walker reports. Is this one of the shortest resignations in political history be? Nigel Farage has said it would not be credible for him to continue to lead his party without a seat at Westminster. The Conservative Party candidate, 18,838. On Friday morning, he was defeated by his Tory rival in his bid to become MP for Thanet South and tendered his resignation. I am a man of my word, I don’t break my word. I shall be writing to the Ukip national executive in a few minutes. Saying I am standing down as leader of Ukip. He said he would take a holiday, but this morning he was at Westminster, talking to the BBC. When his party 's executive decided to reject his resignation, he withdrew it and will remain Ukip leader. It is the democratic wish of the member state -- membership, they wanted him to stay. Nigel did not put this forward himself will stop leaders generally resign when there has been a failure in the campaign and we got 1+ million votes more than any other new political party since the Second World War. Over 200 councillors elected. Ukip is now on the map and we need Nigel Farage to lead us in the next few years. One senior figure in the party told me the decision will undermine Nigel Farage 's reputation for straight talking and all of the efforts to show that Ukip is bigger thanjust one man. He said he thought it was a mistake and Nigel Farage should take a break. Ukip won A million votes at the election although only one MP, Douglas Carswell, was re-elected in Clacton. Nigel Farage has taken his party from the margins of politics and turned it into a force to be reckoned with. But his swift about-face is a gamble, which could harm Ukip ‘s prospects in the future. Undoubtedly, many Ukip members will be absolutely delighted that Nigel Farage is staying on at the helm. Will voters see it like that? Many of them turned to Ukip because it was something different from the rest of the Westminster establishment. Now the party will be grappling with an issue familiar to politicians of all parties, how to win the trust of people. EU leaders are to discuss controversial proposals for a quota system for migrants to decide where those who have failed to Europe should be settled. More than 1,800 migrants have died already this year trying to cross the Mediterranean. The UK can decide not to opt-in to any such system and the Home Office said today the government would oppose a quota that wasn’t voluntary. Our Europe Editor Katya Adler has more from Brussels. You can’t harden your heart to seems like this. These are some of the latest migrants making the perilous journey across the Mediterranean. Many have lost their lives and public and political pressure has been building to do something effective this time. We have decided to step up our efforts to tackle the humanitarian tragedy in the Mediterranean. The EU ‘s foreign policy chief appeal for the United Nations ‘s backing to target cynical people smugglers profiting from the desperation of others, knowingly putting lives at risk. Here in Brussels, the European Commission is preparing to unveil a broader migration policy for Europe. Not only targeting the people traffickers, but formalising search and rescue missions at sea. Opening legal migration routes to the EU from Africa and the Middle East, so people don’t turn to traffickers in the first place. And most controversially, introducing migrant quotas, so newcomers to Europe are distributed more equally amongst EU countries. And this is why. Germany currently receive the lion share of asylum applicants in the new, followed by Sweden with a huge number considering the small size of the country. Britain houses fewer refugees, certainly not the smallest number in the U but it has rolled out being told to take more. In fact, with immigration a divisive topic in many European countries, David Cameron was not the only EU leader to reject a similar proposal on migrant quotas at a recent emergency summit on migration. The Netherlands, Denmark and others agreed. Following last week ‘s elections, Conservative MPs insist Mr Cameron stick to his guns. It can’t in the first week of its operation then suddenly accept a large expansion in its numbers. Europe’s leaders are in Brussels next month and they will properly end up Rowling again over migration policies but this is a fight with Brussels the new government is set to win -- Brussels the new government is set to win -- arguing. Britain has an opt out clause when it comes to EU legislation onjustice opt out clause when it comes to EU legislation on justice and legislation onjustice and home affairs, so David Cameron canjust say no. As he sets out to change Britain’s relationship with the EU, this could just prove to be an early and welcome opportunity for him to show Eurosceptics in and outside his party that he will not bow to Brussels. Our top story this evening. A new-look and entirely Conservative Cabinet for David Cameron, with more women and a role for Boris johnson. Can they be the next football world champions? England’s woman get ready to head to Canada. Later on BBC London. Pretending to be a barrister - the former Surrey councillor who lied about her qualifications and forged university letters to get jobs. And ahead of it’s 250th anniversary the Royal Academy unveils a £50 million redevelopment. The bells at Bradford City Hall tolled 56 times this morning, one for each of the people who died when fire ripped through a stand during a match at Valley Parade 30 years ago today. The blaze broke out during the club’s 1985 match against Lincoln City, killing 54 Bradford City fans and two Lincoln fans. Hundreds of people, including current and former players, paid tribute at a remembrance service in the city’s Centenary Square. Our Sports Editor Dan Roan was there. Peter Fletcher. They were the 56, one by one, those whose lives were lost in the fire honoured here today as the city stopped to reflect. 30 years on, hundreds gathered to pay their respects. For the families who watched loved ones go to a football match but never return home, the memories of that dreadful day still raw. The pain does not go away. 30 years on, the number of people here today speaks for itself. There’s a lot of families here today who will never forget that day and a lot of people in the ground as well, so it has affected lot of people in this city and today means a lot to them. May the 11th 1985, and Bradford where playing Lincoln city at Valley Parade, their last home game of the promotion winning season. A day of celebration soon turn to disaster, a fire in the wooden stand attributed to a discarded cigarette, spread with such ferocity, many were simply not able to escape the inferno. The tragedy vividly described on local radio. We have a fire here at Valley Parade. The whole site of the standard in flames. The game has stopped at Valley Parade. Before that there was a shaking of fists at the far end and they are running out of the ground now. Peterjackson was captain of Bradford City that fateful day. 56 people went to watch a game of football. They ended up on the pitch in a body bag, so it was very harrowing. I think it has been forgotten in sport. That upsets me, as well, because it should never ever be forgotten. Unlike the very different footballing disasters that followed in the 1980s, the fire that happened here at Valley Parade was seen as a tragic accident and didn’t bring about the same wide-ranging changes to the way the game was watched. 30 years on, it remains one of English football ‘s darkest days. A new book written by a survivor who lost three generations of his family in the fire, has questioned whether it was indeed started by accident. But for now, Martin Fletcher is haunted by his memories. I will never have a father again, a brother again, and uncle again. Never had a grandfather again and that has been mY grandfather again and that has been my reality since the age of 12. It is just the nature of what thousands of people at that game went through. Football has come a long way in the last 30 years. While the passing of time may have healed some wounds, this city and the sport will never forget. The body of a woman has been found inside a suitcase in London’s Grand Union Canal. Officers said it was too early to say how long the body had been in the water, and homicide detectives are trying to identify the woman. No arrests have been made and a post-mortem examination is due to take place later. Interest rates have been kept at 0.5%. The decision by the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee means that rates have been at their current level, a historic low for six years. The Bank of England’s quarterly inflation report is due on Wednesday along with a letter from its Governor explaining why inflation is more than 1% off its 2% target. Kevin Pietersen has given England’s new Director of cricket a timely reminder of his skills as a batsman. Appointed on Saturday, Andrew Strauss will talk to the press tomorrow for the first time since being appointed. Pietersen hit 251 not out for Surrey in the Division One County Championship match against Leicestershire at the Oval. Pietersen famously fell out with Strauss three years ago over accusations that he sent texts to the South African team while playing for England. The Women’s Football World Cup kicks off in Canada next month and today England unveiled their squad for the tournament. The side are due to face one of the favourites, France, in their opening match. With interest in the women’s game at an all-time high, and organisers preparing for the biggest tournament to date, the squad are full of optimism about their chances, as Katie Gornall reports. For this squad, the road to Canada began in the heart of London. It was here in the Canadian high commission intifada square that Mark Sampson revealed the 23 players who will go to the World Cup. We have a really good mix of characters. A good mix of technical qualities. It means we have a great chance of being successful this summer. The team have proven 18 months now, only three defeats, they will be a difficult team for anyone to beat so with that mentality, going to the tournament, we can definitely progress. There’s a lot of optimism in the squad but England are ranked sixth in the world, so unlikely to win the World Cup. What they have here is a group with a great blend of youth and experience. There are four players who have won over 100 caps while some will be playing in their first major tournament. Perhaps no one has risen through the ranks quite like one of the squad ‘s youngest players. Frank Kirby. A years ago, she quit football altogether as she struggled to deal with the death of her mother for that now she has rediscovered her love of the game. She’s always there when I’m about to step out for England and when I put my shirt on. She will always be proud of me. I think she wanted it more than me sometimes. I mean, I look back now and it’s absolutely amazing, the journey I have been on. It they are to exceed expectations they will need to close the gap on those above them. They were beaten by Germany in their Wembley warm them. They were beaten by Germany in theirWembley warm up, their Wembley warm up, despite being urged on by a record crowd. The growing popularity of women’s football means this team is in the spotlight like never before. Although England will hope they can capture more thanjust people’s attention and come home smiling. Back to our main story, the return of MPs to Westminster after the general election, among them 56 new SNP MPs who arrived in London to take up their seat House of Commons. We are the third largest party in They’re now the third largest party at Westminster and questions are being asked about how prominent they’ll be on the opposition benches, and how much more power they’ll gain for Scotland. james Cook reports. Westminster. This group of travellers would prefer a UK departure. But for now, they are arriving in London determined to make Scotland’s voice heard at Westminster. Good to see you. Welcome. On planes and trains, the SNP MPs descended on the capital. Demanding change. First of all, we will call for an end to austerity and fighting hard for that. Austerity is damaging the chances of many children. We teetered on the brink of leaving the union last january tell them we’re a family of nations to lead the union and right coming down here to be represented. And so off they went towards Big Ben. A warm welcome in the summer sunshine. APPLAUSE For the past five years, the SNP had just six MPs at Westminster. They have never had more than 11. That was four decades ago. But now, they have 56 from all over Scotland. And they are turning heads. David Cameron can’t simply act as if nothing happened in Scotland on Thursday last week. Everything changed and he has got to recognise that and respond to that. People in Scotland voted for a manifesto to end austerity, wanted more investment in a national health service and more power in the Scottish Parliament. The SNP is now the third biggest party in this Parliament. The new MPs will be sitting on the opposition benches of course, but even in opposition, this new status rings power. When they take their seats at Westminster, the Nationalists are likely to get two questions are likely to get two questions a week at on select committees and more than £6 million of public money to run their offices at Westminster. For now, though, it’s off to work. This woman was one of the MPs who swept away Labour in Glasgow. This is a standard office. You can see Big Ben through the window. How David Cameron deals with this is not yet clear. His government is promising more powers for Edinburgh, but some Tories want a radical redrawing of the UK constitution. To try to see off Scottish independence. A lovely day in Westminster. A beautiful photograph taken here. It was fairly typical for a good chunk of the UK. A band of cloud pushing into England and Wales. The thick cloud across north-western parts of the UK producing some really big showers across the North West of Scotland. A brisk wind continuing overnight. Rain developing from south-west England, the Bristol Channel, South Wales, the heart of the Midlands towards Lincolnshire and perhaps Norfolk and South Yorkshire. Not desperately cold overnight tonight. Watch out for a splash of rain first thing within this zone. Fading away, the action further north across the country will see further blustery showers. In the south of the UK, a nice afternoon. A snapshot for lipm. Plenty of sunshine out there. A bit of a breeze. Not as warm as today in the south-east but feeling comfortable. Across North Wales, and North West England, blustery showers. In Northern Ireland, western Scotland, buffeted by frequent showers. To the east of the high ground, gain, staying largely bright and breezy. Those showers continuing into tomorrow night across the far north. Low pressure for the rest of us. High-pressure building in. The skies clearing. Particularly cold tomorrow night and by Thursday night, don’t be at all surprised if you are in the countryside you wake up to a touch of frost across western areas. Gardeners, take note of that. A fine day on Wednesday for many of us. Enjoy it, but Italy across the South. It then goes pear shaped with heavy rain in southern areas. The best sunshine will be further north. Thank you. john. That’s all from the BBC News at Six so it’sjohn. goodbye from me, Tonight on BBC London News.

There was only one question for the mayor this morning. And for a change it wasn’t whether he wanted the keys to this place. Instead - what role would the Prime Minister offer him in the new government? ~ I have been offered an incredibly exciting job, Mayor of London. It turns out the mayor does have a new role. He will sit once a fortnight in the so called political cabinet. Not a formal government role. But certainly a seat at the top table. His critics say it’s a role too far. On top of his roles as mayor, MP for Uxbridge, and as a newspaper columnist. It isa It is a little price for him and maybe we will see something bigger come for him after he finishes as Mayor of London. I want to see him focus on London. The Mirror can talk about all things that affect London as the Mayor of London. He can talk to any government and I think he has compromised himself. Perhaps aware of the criticism the mayor wrote to all staff at City Hall today saying... He went on... This afternoon, he met London’s Police Commissioner. Hot on the heels of a meeting with Chancellor George Osborne. Will you beat-- pushing the case of London or Borisjohnson’s case? Extraordinary question. If you don’t mind, conversations between me and mY mind, conversations between me and my colleagues I will keep. But what of the criticism of his new role? Your critics will say you will not focus on London. That is totally unfair. It is a job, even as zero hours contract. When is a job not a job? It is a job that involves... And this is unknownjob? It is certainly not a job. To describe this as a job would be an impoverishment of the language, the maximum is as a rule. It is zero hours type role. The magazine says the voice for London... The mayor insisted today that was still him and his seat at the cabinet table would let him push the capital’s case further. Well, as Borisjohnson returns to Westminster, all eyes will turn to who will succeed him as Mayor next year. Karl’s here now. And no shortage of Labour names in the frame. You think politicians and the public would have enough of elections but now, Labourare would have enough of elections but now, Labour are forced out of the blocks. They are starting off their campaign quickly. -- blocks. They are starting off their campaign quickly. -- are first. David Lammy has already declared he was to be Mayor of London. There was one who said he may be going for the Labour leadership but he knocked that on the head today. I am not going to be standing for the Labour leadership. We need someone who will win back the Midlands and understand Scotland as well as the south. My strengths are the size sol Scotland as well as the south. My strengths are the size so I want to be the Labour candidate for Mayor of London. Siddique can is seen by many as the favourite of the party. He ran a campaign in London. We expect him to declare. We have people like Dylan Tessa jowell, Diane Abbott has already declared. And also Christian Wolmar, a transport expert. As for the Lib Dems, the kick off their campaign next week and three Tories have already declared, Andrew Boff and Ivan Massow. More elections round the corner. We cannot wait. Thank you very much indeed. Coming UP Thank you very much indeed. Coming up later. The Royal Academy reveals plans for a transformative redevelopment which they hope will make this one of the most vibrant cultural campuses in central London. An investigation’s been launched after a woman’s body was found in a suitcase, dumped in the Grand Union Canal in west London. The bag was pulled from the water in Little Venice yesterday afternoon. Alpa Patel has more on this story and is there for us tonight. What is the latest? At the moment the police are giving little away. They are saying that as it case was discovered in the canal, just near that point there yesterday afternoon at 2:30pm. We found the body of a woman inside the suitcase. We do not know her name or identity or how long she was in the waterfall. We are unlikely to know the details until a postmortem has taken place. That will not happen tomorrow at the earliest. Has there been any reaction from people in the area? Yes, there has. We have been here for a lot of the days and this is a busy stretch of the canal. There are lots of boats and dog walkers. I spoke to a boat owner who said this was unsettling and the community is very close here. Here are what some other people said. It is a bit scary, we walked down here a lot at work. I find this a bit intimidating and scary. Very shocking, you do not expect things like that in a nice area. We have also seen senior detectives making has said quietly. They are treating the death as suspicious but have made no arrests so far. Many thanks. The postal firm, Whistl, has suspended all its services. The company - formerly known as TNT which delivers to households in London - says it’s failed to attract the investment it needs. 2,000 jobs are under threat. Marc Ashdown has more. Beware the new kids on the blog and hoped for a bright future but no staff face losing theirjobs. All deliveries have been suspended after the bank pulled the plug on investment. We’re obviously very concerned and we want to work the company to ensure we can give employees work. Formerly known as TNT, the company wanted to expand its service rather than relying on Royal Mail for the so-called final mile, putting deliveries through your doors. Consumers gave this reaction... Of a Royal Mail has seen the company as a threat, it has only been responsible by 1% of the UK letter market. Some see today -- today’s development as a hugely significant. The company had spent five years trying to break into this market and have done so with limited success now they are suspending their operations and it is unlikely anyone else will come into this market. Effectively, that means the end of letter delivered a competition in the UK. The company said -- competition in the UK. The company said -- Royal Mail said it could handle the extra volume. Whistl Says it welcomes -- handle the extra volume. Whistl Says it welcomes -- continue handling some deliveries but will discuss potential redundancies with staff. BBC London has obtained dramatic footage of a 10-mile police chase through the capital- in which a disqualified driver, rammed another car, knocked over a cyclist and sent a pensioner scrambling for cover after mounting the pavement. A police helicopter captured the view from above, while officers on the ground filmed their pursuit. This exclusive report from our Home Affairs Correspondent Nick Beake. It isa It is a rainy morning in the City of London and the net police helicopter is being scrambled. A driver has failed to stop. He is a convicted rate this, released on licence. Howson has absconded and fears being sent back to prison. He hurtles through London’s Street at 100 miles an hour, going the wrong way down one-way streets. At one point he knocks a cyclist off his bike who narrowly avoids being run over by the car behind. Officers in her suit records how he was left lying in the road but not seriously injured. -- officers in person it. Howson heads into Hamstead and minds the pavement, sending an elderly women into cover. He does it again. More officersjoined her suit into cover. He does it again. More officers joined her suit which officersjoined her suit which has gone on for more in half an hour. They have reached high Barnet, police try to stop him to no avail. Eventually with his path stopped, he gives up and is arrested. It was here on Farringdon Road he first sped up after failing to stop for police. He embarked on a ten mile journey through London which would last for A5 minutes. The judge at the Old Bailey described his driving as despicable and beyond belief. He had a string of convictions going back to decades and has now been jailed for two years for dangerous driving and driving while disqualified. The man who embarked on the most reckless ofjourneys through the streets of the capital which so easily could have ended in tragedy. A former councillor in Surrey has pleaded guilty to pretending to be a barrister. 36 year-old Monika juneja lied about her qualifications, put false information on her CV and forged letters from the University of Greenwich to gain employment with several London councils. Tarah Welsh has more on this and joins us from the Old Bailey. Monika juneja was elected in 2011 and quickly became the deputy leader of a Conservative group on Guildford Borough Council. She was also in charge of planning. She had controversial ideas to build on the green belt and it was actually people opposed to that who exposed her lies. This goes back to 1997 when she studied at Greenwich University and got a third class degree. She lied in a letter and said she got to want to get into more studies. She created a document saying she had passed all those she had failed. She went on, using the fake qualifications, to get a job at Bromley Council and then Enfield Council and Tower Hamlets as a lawyer. I to thousands seven, she was describing herself as a barrister and invoicing £36 an hour. She also lied on her application form as a Conservative councillor. She pled guilty to pretending to be a barrister and pleaded guilty to fraud. There has been some support for the disgraced for a -- fraud. There has been some support for the disgraced for a -- former councillor? That is correct. The leader of guilt and Borough Council was called as a character witness. You can see him leaving the Old Bailey with Monika juneja is afternoon. He told the court nobody knew about the deception but said she was hard-working and very well liked. He even went as far as giving her thejob, liked. He even went as far as giving herthejob, not liked. He even went as far as giving her the job, not within the council, but in his private business which is a recruitment agency. He said she is still well respected in the area and she has been broken by this. The judge will sentence her next month. Thank you very much. Still to come tonight. It goes from bad to worse for Queens Park Rangers. Yesterday it was relegation from the Premier League, today it might be a multi-million pound fine. It’s a plan to help double its visitor numbers in time for its 250th anniversary. The Royal Academy of Arts has announced a 50-million pound redevelopment - to create new public areas and more gallery space for their historic collections. With the details here’s our Arts Correspondent Brenda Emmanus. A sculptured emanates -- dominates the forecourt. It is business as usual for the Royal Academy who announced a significant development plan today. I would like to think we will be doubled the scale. We will have two entrances, one on Piccadilly and one on Burlington Gardens. The entire site is as big as the site of the British Museum. That gives you a sense, we are right in the heart of Mayfair. The redevelopment will provide new exhibition and public spaces. A link bridge will connect the two sites allowing visitors to experience the inner parts of the Academy. It is going to be really wonderful in 2018 when we have a whole gallery to showcase the collection. This is Turner’s travelling water colour box which he made himself. He used a private view card which you see here. He stuck paints to it and covered it with kindness. He could cover it up when it was wet and put it in his satchel and off he went, sketching. This is a very special object which was given to Queen Victoria by her mother. It is like a travelling oral box. I suspect she did not mix the paints herself. -- travelling oral paint box. It gives the Academy the chance to make this the most animated canvas expert that -- exhibition in the country. By linking it together, we can have this sense of playground, a playground for art culture. The transformation will be completed by 2018. After facing relegation Queens Park Rangers now face a potential fine. They lost 6-nil to Manchester United which means they get relegated. They will be playing in the championship next year. The last time QPR boss in the championship, they broke the rules by spending too much money in -- on players. -- rules by spending too much money in -- on players. -- where in the championship. That means they are now and struggle to these rules in the championship. What are the implications? QPR released a statement today saying they will fight any attempt to have a fine imposed on them for fear play beaches. They submitted accounts of 9.7 million as a loss. That included a £60 million injection of income from the owners of the club. The football league say you cannot do that and the laws should have been closer to £70 million. This would result in a fine of £58 million. The club must await the outcome of legal proceedings but if the decision goes against them they will have the choice of paying the fine or being banned from playing in that league. All of this came the day after the fallout from yesterday. There are some players who could have been available for us and are now not. They have given everything. You just not happy -- They have given everything. You just not happy -- you just do not have that bit of quality to stay in the league. We apologise to their fans for the whole season and not staying up. We tried our best but we just were not good enough. And now to Arsenal, who look to close their season on a high? Yes, they will host Swansea tonight. They are making sure they will get Champions League football to more -- making sure they will get Champions League football to more -- next season. They have opened the last building in the Emirates site. I have been talking to them at the site. In 2011+, the Arsenal defender won the World Cup with Germany. He has since retired from international football, concentrating on life in London with Arsenal. I head of the clash tonight, he helped open the new Arsenal harbour. Although the stadium opened in 2006, this is the last piece in the puzzle. A community hub. The reason the defender is here is because he has a proven record in community events in London and in his hometown of Hanover in Germany. When I came here, different language and different culture but one thing is similar, the work in the community. Everyone is up for it and wants to take care of more people around the stadium. If a face could sum up the power of football, this is it. The defenderjoined it a game of bingo. The secret of learning is through football to get a connection with the children and try to fulfil their potential. A similar story for Arsenal tonight as they try to fulfil their potential, hosting Swansea fulfil their potential, hosting Swansea at the Emirates. The second spot is open and we are one contenderfor spot is open and we are one contender for that. Arsenal hopes to avoid our photo finish for the Premier League second spot continues tonight at eight o’clock. After a weekend commemorating the 70th anniversary of VE Day, tonight a special programme, presented by Twiggy, looks at the aftermath of World War Two in the capital. By VE Day thousands of Londoners found themselves homeless - and some families took extreme measures including squatting in some of the most unlikeliest of places. BY By VE Day, 53,000 London homes were uninhabitable because of the bombs. I was born after the war but my dad often told me that our family home just about survived. The bomb dropped but luckily my dad had built a garage in the garden which to most of the blast but is still blue when much of the back of the house. Others were not so lucky. I ran but I was blasted down the steps into the garden. When I turned round, the house was not there. Realising did not happen fast enough so people took matters into their own hands. These flats here were left empty after the war of the squatters moved in. Squatters are very much in the news, here they are in Kensington moving in. This man was there at the time. Ourfamily had been in the Army, they had no hole -- time. Ourfamily had been in the Army, they had no hole -- no hole. It was organised by the Communist Party and the daily worker at the time and they found places to live. To 5000 people are thought to have squatted, including those who took over as disused army camps. It makes me laugh to think of you as a squatter. It wasn’t all hardships. Not once it was done. It was hard to start with and winter was one of the worst on record. This was 191+7. It seems that the bombing of the capital led to rather rapid action from usually good law-abiding Londoners. You can see the full half hour special about a VE Day later this evening at 7:30pm. Time now for a look at the weather. It was lovely for the VE Day commemorations. Really beautiful conditions yesterday which continue this week as well. We will get rained on Thursday which will change things. Today we have probably be -- Thursday which will change things. Today we have probably be -- peaked in temperature, we got to 23 degrees at Gravesend but we will get a succession of cold fronts coming through. We might get a little bit of rain tonight. When we get to Thursday we will really feel the difference when there’s low-pressure system sweeps them and brings rain, good for the gardens but temperatures will be just 11+ degrees which is below average. Out there at the moment we finished the day with some increasingly hazy sunshine and medium level cloud. That will cap the temperature quite nicely. It will feel mild outside. Those of 90 degrees in the Home Counties. Many places in London and other urban areas will reach 12 degrees. You can see this cold front which will come through in the early hours. Rain will be most likely for Bucks, Hertfordshire and possibly Essex. The most of us it will be a dry commute to work. By the end of the morning, it will have reached the North Sea and we will have sunshine behind it. Tomorrow, not as warm as today. Tomorrow will be more like 17 degrees. Pleasant for the time of year. On Thursday things change. Not only will it be a wet day, it will also turn breezy as well. It could still be dabbed on Friday morning. Lovely sunshine in the afternoon. Some sunny spells over the weekend. Thank you very much. A reminderof the A reminder of the headlines. Now the main headlines....

The Prime Minister celebrates with the fresh crop of Tory MPs before making new appointments to the top team. No department for Boris johnson to run, but he will attend separate political Cabinet meetings. Amber Rudd is in, so is Priti Patel. A total of nine women will now attend Cabinet. David Miliband, in an exclusive BBC interview, criticises his brother Ed’s leadership and that of Gordon Brown. Gordon and then Ed allowed themselves to be portrayed as moving backwards from the principles of aspiration and inclusion which are at the absolute heart of any successful, progressive, political project. He’s back at the top - Nigel Farage stays Ukip leader after the party refuses to let him resign. We’ll be looking at the first day back at Westminster for the intake - new and old. Also tonight: Talks over what should be done with migrants crossing the Med. EU leaders discuss a quota system for settling them. 30 years to the day - the Bradford City fire which led to the deaths of 56 football fans. And an unbeaten triple century for Kevin Pietersen, but will it be On BBC London: Back to Westminster for the Mayor, but his City hall opponents claim it’s Londoners who’ll suffer. And dumped in the Grand Union Canal - police discover a woman’s body in a suitcase. Good evening. Four days after his decisive election win, David Cameron has been completing his Cabinet reshuffle, with several new names joining the top table to replace those Liberal Democrats who lost their seats. More women were appointed to the Government, including Amber Rudd who became Energy Secretary, and was the most high-profile of the female promotions. London Mayor and newly-elected MP Borisjohnson wasn’t made a minister, but he will attend separate political Cabinet meetings. Our deputy political editor, james Landale, reports on all of the days developments. Not all of them, but they are here, nonetheless. More than 70 freshly-elected Conservative MPs with the man who led them to victory. Their success in getting elected is why David Cameron is back in Downing Street. Right back to work. And that work for him meant forming a new Cabinet. More women to be appointed including Amber Rudd, the former investment banker and journalist who was promoted to... Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change. Liz Truss might have had trouble getting into Number Ten, but no trouble getting back into the Cabinet as Environment Secretary. This is all about renewal. This is all about making progress. Last term we had to recover the economy. We had to get things in place. Now we can really make progress. This was a reshuffle designed to show the changing face of the Conservative Party. The son of a bus driver, Sajid javid, the former banker, was promoted to Business Secretary. It is an importantjob. An important job where he will have to calm business fears about an EU referendum. Robert Halfon, a campaigning MP from Essex, becomes Deputy Tory Chairman, leading the party’s appeal to blue collar workers. At ease on social media as much as mainstream media. Others also considered good TV performers include the former presenter Anna Seabury who becomes Small Business Binister and Priti Patel, who is made Employment Minister, both of whom will be able to attend Cabinet without being full members. There were some surprises, john Whittingdale a former aide to Margaret Thatcher, becomes Culture Secretary. At times a candid critic of the BBC, with the job now of overseeing the future of the corporation. Despite these moves, most of the Cabinet remains unchanged, jeremy Hunt stays at health, giving the NHS some continuity. justine Greening stays at International Development and Theresa Villiers remains at Northern Ireland. Less good news for Grant Shapps and Eric Pickles who leaves after five years as Community Secretary. This man was first in to see the Prime Minister this morning. man was first in to see the Prime Ministerthis morning. No Minister this morning. No extra job for him, he is still London mayor. He can attend Cabinet when it discusses party matters. Are you happy with your new post? So long as you don’t call it a job. What it is? It is a role. While some in Downing Street were still toasting their victory with a glass or two, David Cameronjoined his MPs in the House of Commons to celebrate. MPs so excited they Tweeted photos from what was supposed to be a private meeting. The Conservative MPs packed into a meeting room down there, they were you forric. When the Prime Minister walked in they banged the tables for a minute. Minister walked in they banged the tables fora minute. He tables for a minute. He told them to govern as one-nation Conservatives. With such a small majority, if he wants to govern effectively, he’ll have to keep his party together too. For now, they are new and loyal. Are you nervous? A little bit. We have a huge amount to learn in our firsts few days. What matters to him is they keep up with him. As the Labour Party pours over the reasons for its resounding defeat, Ed Miliband’s brother David has criticised his leadership and described the result as ""devastating."" The man who was narrowly beaten by his younger brother in 2010 said both Ed Miliband and former Prime Minister Gordon Brown had ""allowed themselves to be portrayed as moving backwards"" from the key principles of a successful political project. David Miliband also ruled himself out of standing for the leadership. He was speaking exclusively to our North America correspondent Nick Bryant. For five years he’s kept his silence, unwilling to criticise the younger brother who beat him to the Labour leadership. Holding his tongue rather than voicing concerns over the direction the party was heading. This morning in New York, a notion away from Westminster, David Miliband broke what he called his vow and came in with candour and strong criticism about the devastating election defeat for Labour. I think there’s no point in blaming the electorate. Any suggestion they didn’t get it is wrong. They didn’t want what was being offered. I think that both in 2010 and in 2015, Gordon and then Ed allowed themselves to be portrayed as moving backwards from the principles of aspiration and inclusion that are at theness luted of the heart of any success -- inclusion that are at theness luted of the heart of any success -- at the absolute of heart of any successful political project. You are saying unther the leadership of your brother the Labour Party went too far to the left? The choice for us is clear - too far to the left? The choice for us is clear- either we build on what Labour achieved in Government after 1997 and we have a chance to succeed or we abandon it and we fail. That is what happened in 2010 and 2015. It must not happen again. Labour supporters are looking for new leadership. Will he return to Westminster and mount a comeback? I am not a candidate in this leadership election. I am here in New York. I am running a global charity which is delivering aid to millions around the world. The commitmentvy to thejob millions around the world. The commitmentvy to the job I’ve got does not change as a re-- the commitment to thejob does not change as a re-- the commitment to the job I have got does not change. The leadership contest led to a rift. What is the state of brotherly relations now? I am happy to say we remain in touch. Obviously I think that many of the attacks on him were unpleasant and unfair and I attacks on him were unpleasant and unfairand I think unfair and I think he dealt with them we nor mouse dignity and with courage. I have always said I will keep our private conversations private. I have said you remain brothers for life and that is something which has to be kept. Did Labour sew the seeds of defeat backin Did Labour sew the seeds of defeat back in 2010? When it decided to elect Ed as leader? It is important that we learn from both election defeats - that we learn from both election defeats - general election defeats. I think those lessons are about direction and purpose and/orienation of the party rather than about personalities. I think to be honest for my own seasonty there’s no point in pressing the rewind button in life. You don’t get second chances at things. You don’t get to rewind the tape. I think it is important not to fall into that trap. David Miliband has not ruled out a future return to British politics. What he himself calls a soap opera may not be over yet. Our political editor, Nick Robinson, is in Westminster for us. Nick, strong stuff from David Miliband. What’s the significance of him speaking out now? We no longer have to guess do we what David thinks of his brother’s leadership of the Labour Party. It couldn’t be clearer. He thinks he took it too far to the left. He thinks he abandoned new Labour instead of building on it. He thinks he abandoned the idea of aspiration as well. For those fascinated in the drama of the brothers there was plenty of that too. We stay in touch, he said. Hardly the warmest endorsement of your brother. There was a hint that, yes, he cannot run as leader now, but he could be back, in certain circumstances, at the heart of the British political debate. And looking at Cameron’s reshuffle, what does it tell us about the Government he will go on and lead? At times it looked less like a reshuffle than a re-appoint. More than half the Cabinet have kept their old jobs. More than half the Cabinet have kept their oldjobs. Many their old jobs. Many are in the same posts as before. I think it would be a mistake to focus on the continuity and not the change. The dramatic change is not what happened today, but the background to it. There are, of course, no Liberal Democrats in this Cabinet. That means there is also no Deputy Prime Minister. There is also no quad - also no Deputy Prime Minister. There is also no quad - that was the arrangement of the four people who had to agree, two Tories and two Lib Dems every policy. That means they are unbound. It remains to be seen what exactly they do now they can do it on their own. Thank you. Nigel Farage has had his resignation as Ukip leader rejected by the party’s ruling committee. Mr Farage announced on Friday that he’d stand down when he failed to win a seat at the election. The party’s chairman, Steve Crowther, said he believed the election campaign had been a great success. Our political correspondent Carole Walker reports on what it might mean for Ukip’s future. Nigel Farage, who was the leader of Ukip until he stood down on Friday. I still can’t get used to saying those words... This morning, three days after resigning as party leader, Nigel Farage was at Westminster, talking to the BBC. I can really, really speak my mind now! He’d always said he’d stand down if he failed to win a seat at Westminster. The Conservative Party candidate, 18,838... When he was defeated by his Tory rival in his bid to become MP for Thanet South, he duly tendered his resignation. I’m a man of my word, I don’t break my word. So I shall be writing to the UK, Ukip national executive in a few minutes, saying that I am standing down. But when his party’s executive decided to reject his resignation, he withdrew it and will remain Ukip leader. It is the democratic wish of the membership, they wanted him to stay, let’s not forget this. Nigel didn’t put this forward himself, and I would argue that leaders generally resign when there has been a failure in the campaign. We got four million votes more than any other new political party since the Second World War, over 200 councillors elected. Ukip is now on the map, and we need Nigel Farage to lead us in the next few years. But one senior figure in the party told me the decision would undermine Nigel Farage’s reputation for straight talking and all the efforts to show that Ukip is bigger thanjust one man. He said he thought it was a mistake and Nigel Farage should take a break. In Clacton, where Ukip won its only Parliamentary seat, voters had mixed reactions. Quite surprised. I thought he would actually have gone. But...I don’t know, this is politics for you, isn’t it? Obviously, he was never going to resign, so yeah. Hip-hip-hooray, good old Nige! Nigel Farage has turned Ukip into a force to be reckoned with and said he owed it to his party to resume the leadership. But it’s a gamble which could cost his party support if votersjudge him to have gone back on his word. Carole Walker, BBC News, Westminster. Many of the SNP’s 56 new MPs have arrived in London after the party’s sweeping gains in the general election. They were greeted at the Commons by Scotland’s First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, who said her party was determined to make Scotland’s voice heard in London. of the new MPs as they travelled south to take up their seats. This group of travellers would prefer a UK departure. But for now, they are arriving in London determined to make Scotland’s voice heard at Westminster. Good to see you. Welcome. On planes and trains, the Scottish National Party MPs descended on the capital, demanding change. We teetered on the brink of leaving the Union last year, we were told that we’re a family of nations, and we’re coming down here to be represented, so hell hath no fury. We believe it is next to a big clock! And so off they went towards Big Ben and a warm welcome in the summer sunshine. For the past five years, the SNP had just six MPs at Westminster. They have never had more than 11, and that was four decades ago. But now they have 56 from all over Scotland. And they are turning heads. David Cameron can’t simply act as if nothing happened in Scotland on Thursday last week. Everything changed, and he has got to recognise that and respond to that. People in Scotland voted for a manifesto to end austerity, that wanted more investment in the National Health Service and more and TT’IOI’â poWâI’ The SNP is now the third biggest party in this Parliament. The new MPs will be sitting on the opposition benches, but even in opposition, this new status brings power. When they take their seats at Westminster, the Nationalists are likely to get two questions a week at PMOs, places on select committees and more than £6 million of public money to run their offices at Westminster. Alison Thewliss was one of the MPs who swept away Labour in Glasgow. This is a standard office. You can see Big Ben through the window. In Downing Street they worry that the SNP surge means the union macro is at risk. One suggestion is for Edinburgh to take control of tax and spending, whatever the consequences. I was against the Scottish Parliament, I thought it would lead to the break-up of the United Kingdom. It is important that we make one last heave to save it. If that means full fiscal control, so be it? If that is what people want, but it will mean a huge reduction in the quality of our public services, and a big increase in tax. For the Scottish National Party, though, this is a time of excitement and optimism, and that makes people here nervous. james Cook, BBC News, Westminster. The former health minister Norman Lamb has confirmed he’ll stand for the leadership of the Liberal Democrats. He said he made the decision after an awful lot of soul searching, saying it was critical to have an effective Liberal voice in Parliament. EU leaders are to discuss controversial proposals by the European Commission for quota system for migrants to decide where those who have sailed to Europe should be settled. More than 1,800 migrants have died already this year trying to cross the Mediterranean. The UK can decide not to opt into any such system, and the Home Office said today the Government would oppose a quota that wasn’t voluntary. Our Europe editor, Katya Adler, has more from Brussels. You cannot harden your heart to scenes like this. These are some of the latest migrants making the perilous journey across the Mediterranean. Many have lost their lives. Public and political pressure has been building to do something effective - this time. We decided to step up our efforts to tackle the humanitarian tragedy in the Mediterranean... In New York today, the EU’s foreign policy chief appealed for United Nations backing to target cynical people smugglers profiting from the desperation of others, whereas here in Brussels, the European Commission is preparing to unveil a broader migration policy for Europe, formalising search-and-rescue missions at sea, and, most controversially, introducing quotas for all EU countries so that migrants applying for asylum can be distributed more evenly. Economic migrants are supposed to be sent home. Germany currently receives the lion’s share of asylum applicants in the EU, followed by Sweden, with a huge number relative to its population. Britain houses fewer asylum seekers, though certainly not the smallest number in the EU. But it refuses to be told to take more. Immigration is a divisive issue in many European countries. Along with David Cameron, a number of European leaders rejected similar quota proposals at a recent emergency summit on migration. Germany says this is unacceptable. Europe must be open, and we need a fair burden sharing on a European level to deal with this challenge. Nobody can say, ""Close the borders, we don’t accept them.""' We have to be helpful - as a Christian-based continent. But after last week’s election, Conservative MPs say Mr Cameron must stick to his guns. The current Conservative government made a very solemn pledge to the British people that it would control migration and reduce the numbers to tens of thousands. It can’t, in the first week of its operation, then suddenly accept a large expansion in the numbers. Europe’s leaders are here in Brussels again next month, and they’ll probably end up rowing again over migration policies. But this is a fight with Brussels that the new Cameron government is set to win. Britain has an opt-out clause when it comes to EU legislation onjustice and home affairs, so David Cameron canjust say no. As he sets out to change Britain’s relationship with the European Union, this could just to prove an early and welcome opportunity for him to show Eurosceptics in and outside his party that he will not bow to Brussels.

Hundreds of people have attended a service to remember the 56 football fans who died and the many more who were injured when a fire ripped through the main stand at Bradford City 30 years ago today. The stadium caught fire during a game against Lincoln City. Our sports editor, Dan Roan, was at the service. BELL TOLLS Peter Fletcher. Nellie Foster. They were the 56. One by one, those whose lives were lost in the Bradford fire honoured here today as the city stopped to reflect. 30 years on, hundreds gathered to pay their respects. For the families who watched loved ones go to a football match but never return home, the memories of that dreadful day still raw. The pain doesn’t go away. 30 years on, the number of people here today speaks for itself. There is a lot of families here today who will never forget that day, and a lot of people who were in the ground as well, so it has affected a lot of people in this city, and today means a lot to them. May 11th 1985 - Bradford were playing Lincoln City at Valley Parade, their last home game of a promotion-winning season. But a day of celebration soon turned to disaster. A fire in the wooden main stand attributed to a discarded cigarette spread with such ferocity that many were simply unable to escape the inferno, the tragedy vividly described on local radio. And we have fire here at Valley Parade, the whole end of the stand is actually in flames. I can see the orange of the flames, the game is actually stopped here at Valley Parade. Before that, there was a certain amount of shaking fists and a bit of a hoo-hah at that far end. And they are running out of the ground from that far end at this moment! Unlike the very different footballing disasters that followed in the 1980s - at Heysel and at Hillsborough - the fire that happened here at Valley Parade was seen as a tragic accident. It didn’t bring about the same wide-ranging changes to the way the game was watched. But 30 years on, it remains one of English football’s darkest days. Peterjackson was captain of Bradford City that fateful day. Them 56 people only came to watch a game of football, and end up on the pitch in a body bag, so it were a really harrowing thing to see. Football has come a long way in the last 30 years, but while the passing of time may have helped heal some wounds, this city, this sport, will never forget. Dan Roan, BBC News, Bradford. Greece might run out of money in as little as two weeks, its finance minister warned as a meeting was held in Brussels to discuss a resolution to the country’s financial crisis. The negotiations were said to have made important progress, but disagreement remains over key issues, Our economics editor, Robert Peston, reports. Greek dock workers opposing privatisation of their port demanded by other eurozone government and no longer confident their Syriza government will resist the pressure because Athens is increasingly desperate for 7.2 billion euros of additional bailout loans from them. They have to be loyal to their declaration and to their promises before the elections. As much as possible - we know that the pressure is huge, but there are certain points that they cannot go back. So why on earth does Greece need to borrow yet more? Well, it’s because of the massive repayments it faces on its existing debts, including 750 million euros due to the International Monetary Fund tomorrow. A further 2.1 billion euros in instalments to the IMF by the end of August, and a huge 6.7 billion euros to the European Central Bank injuly and August. And if all its liabilities are included, including the costs of pensions and wages, the Greek government has to find 35 billion euros within four months. And it won’t be easy. Back for yet another bailout negotiation, Yanis Varoufakis, Greece’s unconventional finance minister, who warns that the clock is ticking to make sure Greek banks don’t run out of money. I shall be frank with you, the liquidity issue is a terribly urgent issue. This is common knowledge, let’s not beat about the bush and pretend otherwise. So how long for Greece to reach agreement with creditors to persuade the European Central Bank to release funds for Greek banks? It seems to me that, in the perspective of the time frame that we are facing, we are talking about the next couple of weeks. But there has been progress. Some important issues have now been discussed in depth, but more time is needed to bridge the remaining gaps and to reject comments of agreement. Greece and its creditors are closer to making changes to the tax system but there are big gaps on pensions and work. Sunset over beautiful, historic Athens. Sunset for Greece’s ability to pay debts and stay in the euro? Well, not yet. Robert Peston, BBC News. Kevin Pietersen’s hoping a crunch meeting tonight could lead to an England test recall after months out in the cold. He confirmed he’d be meeting the new director of cricket, Andrew Strauss, after an unbeaten triple century in a county match today. Patrick Gearey reports from the Oval. 326 runs scored, one point made - Kevin Pietersen has argued his case for England selection in print, in interviews, and here it was in an innings. This was a man who hadn’t played for England since last winter’s Ashes, sacked apparently for being disruptive. He’s trying to force his way back by scoring runs for Surrey, and this was his reaction to making 100 of them. He knew what this meant. Andrew Strauss, the new director of cricket, would have to watch Pietersen smashing Lancashire around the park, knowing he’d impressed England fans and perhaps unnerved enemies. ~ -- Leicestershire. Well, I’m an Australian, and I think you’d be silly not to have him in your side for this upcoming Ashes. I don’t think Andrew Strauss gets on with him, but, to my way of thinking, any management that can’t manage a maverick shouldn’t be in management. While playing for England, Strauss and Pietersen had several public fallings-out. Tomorrow Strauss meets the media in his newjob in charge of the England team - Pietersen has set the questions. With mischievous timing, Kevin Pietersen has smashed his way to his highest ever first-class score. When he went to 200, the crowd here sung, ""Are you watching, Andrew Strauss?"" Tomorrow, the press will ask the same. Before that, Pietersen will meet Strauss tonight, his England future on the line. The previous coach, Peter Moores, has gone, and the batsman feels this was his moment. That’s probably one of the best innings that I’ve ever played. Notjust numbers, but because of how important the timing is, of what’s happening in English cricket at the moment, to how I’ve always said there is this burning desire to play for England again. Kevin Pietersen can provoke extreme reactions in people, but Leicestershire will tell you - facing him when he’s in this mood isn’t fun. Patrick Gearey, BBC News, at the Oval. Newsnight is on BBC Two, here’s Evan Davies with a quick preview. The opinion polls took one hell of a beating on election night.

Tonight on BBC London News. How will a place for the Mayor in the political Cabinet affect Londoners? Borisjohnson plays down the appointment. Maximum it is is a role. It is a supportive - it is a zero-hours contract type role. Dumped in the Grand Union Canal- police discover a woman’s body in a suitcase. Dramatic footage of a police chase through the capital- unbelievably no-one was injured. A redevelopment for the Royal Academy of Arts. Good evening. I’m Riz Lateef. It’s perhaps an unusual way to describe an appointment by the Prime Minister. A ‘non-job’ is how Borisjohnson, who’s now an MP, described his role in David Cameron’s political Cabinet. It comes as the Mayor’s City Hall opponents questioned the ability to do two jobs, claiming he’d compromised himself. But, in a letter to his staff, Mrjohnson hit back, saying, it would in no way diminish his appetite to get things done for London and for Londoners. Here’s our Political Correspondent Karl Mercer. Are you expecting a place in the Cabinet? As I said before, I have to fulfil my mandate in London. Whether it was leaving home or walking up Downing Street... There was only one question for the Mayor this morning and for a change it wasn’t whether he wanted the keys to this place. Instead, what role would the Prime Minister offer him in the new Government. Congratulations, sir. I have been offered an incredibly exciting job. Mayor of London. It turns out he has a new role. He will sit once a fortnight in the so-called political Cabinet, not a formal Government role, but certainly a seat at the top table. His critics say it is a role too far on top of his position as mayor, MP for Uxbridge and as a newspaper columnist. It is a little prize for him and maybe we’ll see something else bigger come after he finishes his term as mayor for London. I want him to focus on London. He is elected to deliver for the capital. The mayor can talk about all the things that really matter for London, as the Mayor of London and he can talk on a very strong ground to a Government of any colour. I think he’s compromised him self now. Perhaps aware of the criticism, the mayor wrote to all staff at City Hall today, He went on: This afternoon, he met London’s Police Commissioner, hot on the heels of a meeting with Chancellor, George Osborne. Is this true? Have you been pushing London’s case or Borisjohnson’s case? An extraordinary question. I’ve been advocating London, as you can imagine. What have you been saying to them? Well, do you know, if you don’t mind, conversations between me and my colleagues, I will keep... What of the criticism of his new role? You know your critics will say, he’s got anotherjob. That is the whole point. And that’s totally unfair because I have made it, I said - I cannot have a job, OK, job, even zero-hours contract, no, no, no. This is a non-job? Itisa... When is a job not a job? It is a job that involves... Hello. How are you? This is a non-job? It is certainly not a job, OK? I resist, to describe it as a job would be a impoverishment of the language. The maximum it is a role. It is a supportive... It is a zero-hours contract type role. The magazine says the Voice of London, the mayor insisted today that is still him and said his seat at the Cabinet table will let him push the capital’s case still further. An investigation’s been launched after a woman’s body was found in a suitcase, dumped in a canal in west London. It was discovered in the Grand Union Canal in Little Venice yesterday afternoon.

Alice Bhandhukravi is there tonight- what more do we know? Police have given out very little information so far. They say the suitcase was pulled out of the water after a passer-by found it and called them yesterday afternoon. When they opened the suitcase, they discovered the body of a woman inside. Now, we have no information about her identity or her age or indeed how long her body had been in the water for. We should have indeed how long her body had been in the waterfor. We should have more information after a postmortem examination takes place. The earliest that can happen is tomorrow. As you will see behind me, there are a number of houseboats along this stretch of water. It is a busy area. Lots of passers by and therefore very unsettling for people who life in this area, particularly people who live on this stretch of water. Now, we spoke to some local people earlier. Quite surprising and sort of a bit scary. We walk down here a lot at work and Ifind it sort of a bit intimidating and scary. Very shocking. It’s a nice area. You don’t expect it. Now, there is still a police presence here. There are officers further up the canal. There is an area of the towpath which is sealed off with police tape and they are treating this death as suspicious. No arrests have been made so far and the investigation continues. Thank you. BBC London has obtained dramatic footage of a 10-mile police chase through the capital- in which a disqualified driver rammed another car and knocked over a cyclist. A police helicopter captured the view from above, while City of London officers on the ground filmed their pursuit. This exclusive report from our Home Affairs Correspondent Nick Beake. It is a rainy morning in the City of London and the Met’s police helicopter is being scrambled. A driver has failed to stop. It turns out he’s a convicted rapist, released on license. lI1-year-old Chris Houson has absconded from his hostel and fears being sent back to prison. He hurtles through London streets at up to 50 miles per hour, going through no entry signs and the wrong way down one-way streets. At one point, turning left, he knocks a cyclist off his bike, who narrowly avoids being run over by the car behind. Officers in pursuit record how he’s left sprawling in the road, but not seriously injured. His race through the capital continues. He comes into Hampstead and increasingly frantic mounts the pavement, sending an elderly woman diving for cover. It does not stop him. A moment later, he does it again. More officersjoin the pursuit. It’s gone on for more than half an hour. the police try to stop him but with no avail. Eeventually, with his path blocked he gives up and is finally arrested. It was here on Faringdon Road that he first sped off after failing to stop for the police. He embarked on what would be a ten-mile journey through London streets and would last A5 minutes. A judge at the Old Bailey described his driving as ""despicable and beyond belief."" Chris Houson who had a string of driving convictions going back two decades what has now been has now been jailed for two years for dangerous driving and driving whilst disqualified. A man who embarked on the most reckless ofjourneys through the capital’s streets, which so easily could have ended in tragedy. A former Councillor in Surrey has pleaded guilty to pretending to be a barrister. 36-year-old Monika juneja was a Conservative councillor on Guildford Borough Council until last week. She lied about her qualifications, put false information on her CV and forged university letters to gain employment with several London councils. The Royal Academy of Arts has announced a £50 million redevelopment. It’s part of a plan to help double its visitor numbers in time for its 250th anniversary. New public areas and more gallery space will be created - as our Arts Correspondent Brenda Emmanus reports. A sculpture dominates the forecourt. It is business as usual for the Royal Academy of Arts, who today announced a significant redevelopment plan, set to increase their size and visitor numbers. I would like to think we will be double the scale, but four times as significant because we’ll have two entrances. One Bellington gardens, one on Piccadilly. The site, as a whole, from Piccadilly to the gardens is as big as the site of the British museum and that gives you a sense we are right in the heart of Mayfair. The £50 million redevelopment will provide new exhibition and public spaces. A link bridge will connect the sites allowing visitors to experience the inner workings of the academy and a chance to view the historic collection. More space must be a very exciting prospect. It will be wonderful in 2018 when we can have a whole gallery really showcase the collection. If you want to look here. This is Turner’s travelling water colour box, we call it. Actually he made it himself, we think. Really? Yes. So, he used a private view card, which is what you see here and he stuck some paints to it and covered it with canvass. So when it was wet he could cover it up and put it in his pocket or satchel and off he went sketching. This is a really special object. It belonged or was given to Queen Victoria by her mother. I suspect she did not mix the paints herself but somebody would have mixed them for her. It is hoped these plans will pump new life into this 2lI7-year-old institution. It gives the academy a chance to make this the make this the most animated cultural campus in London. We have a great location. We have a wonderful collection of building, spaces and by linking it together we can have a sense of a kind of playground for art and culture. This transformation will be completed in time for their 250th anniversary in 2018. OK, that is it from me.ly say good night and leave you with a look at weather. A nice start for the beginning of the week. The week for the weather has started warm. We got to 23 Celsius at graves end today. A fine, warm start. There’ll be rain on Thursday if you are hoping for some for the garden or the parks. At the moment it is largely dry. Through the night there is medium-level cloud. That will kept the warmth of the day in. Many places will be very comfortably in double figures. Then towards the end of tomorrow morning’s rush hour there’ll be some rain which comes through. I don’t think there’ll be very much around. It will be patchy and through quickly. So, towards the end of the morning the sunshine has returned, the dry conditions too. A breeze blowing as well. It will be fresher than today, but temperatures are respectable - than today, but temperatures are respectable -17-19 Celsius throughout the afternoon. In the middle of the week there is fine weather. Light winds on Wednesday. Lovely sunshine. Fair weather cloud here and there. As we get into Thursday, that is when we’ll have a low pressure system setting itself up. We know it will spin in. It will bring us some rain. Probably the best chance of rain through the week. There might be bits on and off throughout the day. Temperatures will be nearer 14 Celsius. We will feel the difference there. A fine day on Wednesday. We have some rain on Thursday. Then it will brighten UP on Thursday. Then it will brighten up a little bit on Friday. The temperature will start to lift a bit. As for the weekend, well, we’ve got generally a cloudy start to it. There might be some dampness to begin with. It will brighten up on Sunday. It will be cooler than we have got out there at the moment. Good evening. Sunshine over the next few days and rain as well. Hopefully nothing too severe. The same cannot be said of the USA. We’ve had tornadoes here. They have caused this sort of damage. We are not out of the woods yet. Some torrential downpours, I have lent storms, track from the plains -- violent storms, track from the plains. A lot of cloud from the south-west. It looks worse than it is. We will see rain over south-west England, south Wales, through parts of the England towards the Wash. Most of the blustery showers tomorrow over the north-west of the UK, whereas further south things will settle down after a damp place in places, the sun will shine through the afternoon. This is 4pm - it should be pleasant. A bit of a breeze, not too strong. Up into the high teens in places. Showers over north Wales. Some bright spells for Northern Ireland. The east of Scotland, but further frequent, heavy, Scotland, but further frequent, heavy, blustery showers over the west of Scotland. For the rest of us tomorrow night, as high pressure builds in, clearing skies, light winds and I know we are heading to the middle of May, potentially by the morning we will not be far of freezing. Gardeners take note. A chilly start to Wednesday. Wednesday looks like a fantastic day. Yes, the odd shower over the far north-east. Elsewhere, apart from fair weather cloud there’ll be a lot of sunshine. It will feel very nice. It does not last. The jet stream will start to wake up again and when the jet stream takes a dip like this, that is quite ominous, within that we tend to get areas of low pressure. That is what we will get on Thursday. Infact, this area of low pressure looks like slicing across the southern half of the UK on Thursday. Potentially some areas across central and southern England and Wales could see a very wet and chilly day. Some places not getting into double figures. The best of the brightness on Thursday across northern areas. As you king. Arabella! MUSIC: In The Hall Of The Mountain King We wish to know - why is there no more magic done in England?

Broadening its appeal- Rugby reaches out to find a new home in state schools. Plus, it’s getting warmer as we head to the weekend, we’ll have a local and national forecast coming up. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at one. The head of Thomas Cook says he is 'deeply sorry’ about the deaths of Bobbi and Christi Shepherd, the two children who died of carbon monoxide poisoning in a holiday chalet nine years ago. The company has been at the centre of a media storm after an inquest ruled that the company had breached its duty of care. Peter Fankhauser says the firm had not shown the compassion it should have done to the family and admitted that the company could have done better in the way it handled the deaths. Ed Thomas reports. This was Bobbi and Christi Shepherd, they were six and seven years old. This was their family holiday. They died in their beds, as carbon monoxide from a faulty boiler poisoned them in a sleep. Killed by the failings of a hotel and a tour company which breached its duty of care. For nine years, the children’s parents have waited for a full apology from Thomas Cook. Today in front of an audience of investors, the Chief Executive said this. I am deeply sorry as a father myself, about the tragic death of Bobbi and Christi Shepherd in 2006, on a Thomas Cook holiday. This apology comes days after bad headlines for Thomas Cook for its refusal to say sorry. Only last week the same Chief Executive who apologised on camera today came here to the coroner ‘s Court. At the inquest into Bobbi and Christi Shepherd, in front of their parents, Peter Fankhauser refuse to accept any blame. He said Thomas Cook had done nothing wrong. It has emerged Thomas Cook received £3.5 million in compensation after the children’s deaths. Much more than Bobby is -- children’s deaths. Much more than Bobby is -- than the parents got. It is clear there are things that we as a company could have done better during the last nine years. In particular how we have conducted our relationship with the family. It is unclear if Bobbi and Christy’s parents are aware of the apology but Thomas Cook says it will try to meet them to put right so much wrong. In the last few minutes, Sharon would’s husband Paul Wood has said they have not seen the video and they will meet Peter Fankhauser tomorrow. With me now is our Business Editor Kamal Ahmed. It isa It is a dreadful time for the family and the company has also been struggling? It is always a problem in these types of cases where a company reversed to legal speak when dealing with something which is a terrible human tragedy. Certainly Thomas Cook has been criticised on Facebook and Twitter and social media, people saying it should be boycotted for the way it responded. I spoke to Peter Fankhauser this morning, he went further in his phone call with me. He said when he said to the coroner ‘s inquiry that Thomas Cook had nothing to apologise for, he said he regretted the words. It was not appropriate. He said we should have shown more compassion to the family. In the Greek criminal is Thomas Cook were not found guilty directly of any fault in the deaths of these children. -- directly of any fault in the deaths of these children. -- in the criminal case. Clearly they believe they should have had a more human response. If there was a boycott of a travel company it can be very damaging, there are other travel companies on the high Street. This do Frank Hauser will hope this goes some way to making amends -- do Frank Hauser will hope this goes some way to making amends -- Peter Fankhauser will hope this goes some way. Police have revealed that more than 1,400 suspects have been investigated over historic child sex abuse allegations against VIPs - including politicians, celebrities and institutions. Our Home Affairs Correspondent Tom Symondsjoins us from Central London. What else have they been saying? This was a briefing from Simon Bailey, Chief Constable of Norfolk and leading the police nationally in the approach to historical child abuse. Child abuse in the past and also institutional child abuse in schools and hospitals. He said the rise in the number of reports of that sort of child abuse is absolutely unprecedented. 11+33 is the number of suspects that the police currently have on a national database, they are coordinating with the police forces investigating. One agent 65% increase over the last three years. --100 65%. Of those suspects, about a third have not yet been identified. Of those that remain, 261 were prominent people. Of which 76 were either local or national politicians. 1+3 in the music industry. Seven in sport. This is quite a big number, a large amount of work for the police. It is the first time that the police has said how many suspects they are investigating with regard to this sort of historical prominent child abuse. They have said they prioritise child protection. If they find children are at risk now this comes first. Marks and Spencer has announced its first rise in annual profits in four years. The retailer reported a 6.1% increase in pre-tax profits to just over £660 million. The chief executive, Marc Bolland, says clothing is one area which is now showing signs of significant improvement. Our Business Correspondent Emma Simpson reports. Is this the skirt that will deliver a revival in women’s fashion at Marks and Spencer? It only went on sale last week. It is not cheap, but thousands of women have already signed up for this, thanks to all of the bowlers. The fashion press loved it, and so did a few celebrities. -- thanks to the hype. Marx has spent a lot of time and money improving fashion credentials, women’s clothing is crucial to success. The first time in four years, the sales have started to rise. That is one reason why profits are up today. It has also been improving its supply chain. Buying for less and selling for more. The question now is, is Marks & Spencer finally turning the corner? In the last three months we haveis corner? In the last three months we have is in the first signs of positive sales. For me the question is whether it is flash in the pan or whether it can be sustained. Long-term it means getting more younger women through the doors, and thatis younger women through the doors, and that is not easy. I am not a regular Marks & Spencer shopper. Would you buy anything else? I saw and I stress in the video. I come here for lunch but that is about it. Here is another reason profits are up, the food business had a strong year. Outperforming the market. But the clothing Iles really count, for the year as a whole the sales were still below expectation, the boss says things are improving by the day but he refused to say the job of revitalising women’s fashion had been done. -- revitalising women’s fashion had been done. -- clothing sales really count. To the outside world he was one of our most distinguished statesman - Supreme Allied Commander of South East Asia Command in World War Two, the last Viceroy of India, a First Sea Lord and Chief of the Defence Staff. Lord Louis Mountbatten was all these things - but to Prince Charles he was ‘uncle Dickie’. In the last hour the Prince has described him as the grandfather he never had. Speaking in County Sligo before he visits the place where Lord Mountbatten was murdered in 1979, the prince said his death had helped him to understand the agonies borne by so many others in these islands. Our Royal Correspondent Nicholas Witchell reports. Yes, a remarkable couple of days, in Galway, the meeting with Gerry Adams, and in County Sligo today, a powerful and personal speech. Prince Charles powerful and personal speech. Prince Charles speaking about the death of Lord Mountbatten. And then hear later, thisjourney we Lord Mountbatten. And then hear later, this journey we we are Lord Mountbatten. And then hear later, thisjourney we we are going to witness reaching its most significant destination. Total Mullaghmore, the little seaside village in County Sligo, which became the scene of a tragedy for the Royal family 36 years ago, but today amid tight security is preparing to welcome Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall. It is still some hours before they will be in Mullaghmore, this morning they were in County Sligo city where Prince Charles spoke about the murder of his uncle Lord Mountbatten and what it had taught him. Through this experience I understand in a profound way the agonies borne by so many others in these islands. Of whatever faith, many others in these islands. Of whateverfaith, denomination or political tradition. whateverfaith, denomination or politicaltradition. It political tradition. It was notjust Charles’s family grieving after the IRA bomb which blew the boat to pieces. His 11+-year-old grandson and a 15-year-old local boy, Paul Maxwell, also died in the blast. Paul Maxwell’s mother has said she hopes that groups which still embraced violence will follow the lead Prince Charles and move on. I hope they concede that he’s stretching out the hand of friendship. -- stretching out the hand of friendship. -- that they can see. And being forgiving. And I hope that they can do the same. That they can stretch out the hand of friendship. And that they also can find it in their hearts to forgive. Many will not remember what happened in this seaside community nearly 1+0 years ago now. But the message from a mother who lost her son, from a prince who lost his great uncle is the same. That in the island of today, there is no place for those that believe in violence. It will be late this afternoon that Prince Charles gets here to Mullaghmore, he will have attended a service of peace and reconciliation at a church nearby. While he is here in Mullaghmore he’s expected to be accompanied by one of the grandson 's of Lord Mountbatten, one who was on board the boat and survived. Thank you forjoining us. Nine men are being questioned by police after being arrested on suspicion of involvement in the Hatton Garden jewellery heist. Scotland Yard revealed it has recovered a ""significant amount of high value property"" after raiding 12 addresses across London and Kent. The men being held range in age from 1+3 to 76. Sarah Campbelljoins us from Hatton Garden. elaborate planning and jewellery worth millions was something like out of a Hollywood plot but for the families and businesses involved this was a very real crime. The news that some arrests have been made has been welcomed here. It was supposed to be the safest possible place for priceless family heirlooms and preciousjewels to be stored but the pictures of empty deposit boxes littering the vault floor hold a different story. The investigation spread across London and Kent yesterday with 12 addresses raided by the flying squad including this one in Enfield North London. Hugh Doyle pictured here, is one of those believed to have been arrested. The police revealed a significant amount of property was recovered as a result of the raids and a total of nine men were arrested including two at this property in Dartford. 76 roll Brian Reader, and his 50 roll son, Paul, are believed to being questioned -- son, Paul, are believed to being questioned -- 76-year-old Brian Reader and his 50-year-old son. As I said, we would come up trumps... The raid occurred over the Easter weekend, 56 safety deposit boxes were emptied and millions of pounds ofjewellery were among to those thought to be lost. This had to be a carefully planned operation, they entered at street level and broke into a lift shaft and dropped down to the basement. There they prised open a shirt and used in industrial strength drilled to grind through the half metre deep wall. They spent the Easter weekend breaking open the safety deposit boxes setting off an alarm. A review is underway as to why the only response was from a private security card who saw nothing. -- private security card who saw nothing. -- security guard. The police are appealing for information about a white chanted fan, seen at the scene of the crime and they are asking people to stay patient as the investigations continue -- asking people to stay patient as the investigations continue -- white transit van. Despite families and businesses thinking they may have lost their items forever, news from police does seem to be that some items at least have been recovered. In the meantime those nine men aged between 1+3 and 76 continue to be questioned. Our top story this lunchtime. The boss of Thomas Cook apologises to the parents of the two children who died of carbon monoxide poisoning during a holiday in Corfu nine years ago. And still to come. In a rare interview, the South African athlete Caster Semenya talks about her humiliation after her gender was questioned and reveals her plans to return to the top of her sport. It’s sometimes compared with the first day at a new school- as the newest clutch of MPs try to get to grips with their first term at Westminster. Faces old - and new - are gathering for the start of the new Parliamentary session - and for many it’s been a long journey from local party politics to the historic seat of power. The Conservative Anne-Marie Trevelyan for Berwick upon Tweed is one of the new class of 2015 - here taking the oath of allegiance as she takes up her seat on the back benches. Our correspondent Danny Savage caught up with her as she travelled from the most northern constituency in England, to the Palace of Westminster. And journey’s end could hardly be more iconic. So how many years have you been working to get here? Well, it’s nine years. I was first selected nine years ago by my associations. Stood in 2010, didn’t quite make it, stood again this time and the electors have been kind enough to send me down here to be their voice, to stand up for them. How does it feel? Quite daunting. When you look at it, you think, wow. Hundreds and hundreds of years of extraordinary people fighting for Great Britain. The first official duty, take part in the election of the speaker. But not before mentioning a bit of local business. You can hear less than an hour and you’ve already hassled the Transport Secretary about the A1! Well, yes. You know, no point seeing the man and not reminding him that I’m here! He looked thrilled to see me, I thought! And that is the lot of a backbench constituency MP. Trying to make their voice heard above everybody else’s at the centre of government. Danny Savage, BBC News, Westminster. Tristram Hunt has ruled himself out of the Labour Leadership race and instead has given his backing to Liz Kendall. Mr Hunt said he could not be confident of enough support from fellow MPs to launch a bid. Let’s get more on this from our Assistant Political Editor Norman Smith. Where are we in this contest now that Mark another one bites the dust. Tristam Hunt has pulled out after Chuka Umunna pulled out and another MP said, no thanks. By the day the list of candidates is shrinking. What we heard today from Tristram Hunt was almost a cry of despair that the knife is being throttled out of this contest almost before it has got going with a list of candidates going through to the next round perhaps just three. But more than that Tristram Hunt sort to hold the bandwagon loading up behind Andy Burnham, the runaway favourite, dismissing his idea that the task ahead was to rediscover the beating heart of the Labour Party. He also implied that Andy Burnham had been preparing this campaign before the election and he suggested the union, mainly backing Andy Burnham or wielding disproportionate influence, and crucially he suggested a change to the party rules to enable the party to trigger another leadership election, midterm in this Parliament, although he did not like the present that was elected or thought he was a dud. So it seems to me that he chucked a grenade over his shoulder as he left the contest. An international meeting which included Malaysia and Indonesia has agreed that temporary shelter should now be offered to some 7,000 migrants stuck on boats. One boat that had been at sea for more than two months, has now arrived in the Indonesian province of Aceh. It had previously been refused entry to land. Our correspondent, Martin Patience, has been to see what conditions were like for the 1+00 migrants on board. Well this boat was packed with hundreds of migrants. And now hundreds of miles away off the coast of Indonesia we found it again. Hard to imagine the horror of what goes on board the ship. Hundreds of migrants packed on. And they left some of their items, plastic bags, a jacket. Most were living below decks so we can take a look down their to see what conditions were like. It is hard enough going down these rickety ladder stairs when the boat is stable. Imagine it rocking about in a rough sea. The first thing that strikes you when you come down here is the overwhelming stench, the stench of you’re in. It is sweltering me hot. And just imagine -- you’re right. Hundreds of migrants packed down in here. Children, women and men packed in this tight space. They were forced to eat and sleep here, to try to get some rest. It must’ve been a nightmare. And many thought they would not survive this journey. The Home Secretary has been warned that ""bobbies on the beat"" are an endangered species - because of cuts to police budgets. But Theresa May hit back - telling the Police Federation annual conference to stop ""crying wolf"" - and accusing the Federation of ""scare-mongering"". Theresa May said that in spite of police numbers having been cut, crime had fallen. Our Home Affairs Correspondent, june Kelly reports. She is back. The Police Federation might have been expecting that a new government would mean a change of Home Secretary. This annual encounter between rank-and-file officers and Theresa May has taken on the air of a grudge match. What would it be like this year? It soon became clear. I have some severe concerns about conditions at the moment. Pay has been frozen. The Home Secretary a bit surprised by the early ambush. And then on to the platform to listen to the Police Federation leader. He began by declaring thatjust Federation leader. He began by declaring that just because they were not friends, he did not have to be enemies. He then went on to list all the areas where they were on different sides. At the police have. Police numbers down. Resilience of the service, down. Police morale, down. But do not fret, some things are on the up. Cyber crime is up. Sexual offences up. Violent crime up. Terrorist threat, up. Well, Home Secretary, time is up. Last year Theresa May wasjaw-dropping in the time is up. Last year Theresa May was jaw-dropping in the ferocity free speech. Today she was on the attack again, accusing the Federation of scaremongering and dismissing their previous predictions. He warned that the police and public well-being put in danger in 2001, and 2007. The truth is that crime fell in each of those years. So please, for your sake, and for the thousands of police officers who work so hard every day, this crying wolf has got to stop. So another uncompromising speech from the Home Secretary. There is a gulf between Theresa May and the delegates here. They believe she simply is not listening to them when it comes to the consequences of those cuts. The Home Secretary said they could either work with her or shout from the sidelines. It’s the moment when one would hope patients are cared for best - the moment their lives are about to end. But, according to the health ombudsman, thousands of dying patients in England, are being let down, by poor end-of-life care. The report details ""tragic"" cases where people’s suffering could have been avoided or eased. The Dying Without Dignity report said it had found too many instances of poor communication - along with poor pain management- and inadequate out-of- hours services. Our Health Correspondent jane Dreaper reports. Susan SUSBFI i.8WIââ FICE her mother’s dying days in hospital very upsetting. It has affected the whole family. Margaret was taken to hospital with dehydration and deteriorated quickly. It was absolutely traumatising on every level. We watched her die in pain, we could see that she was not comfortable, which is what they promised she would be. Those images of her, which is very much the picture and crying out in pain, they will stay with me for the rest of my life. It is no way to remember your mother. There was no dignity involved, it was not a good death. Not a good and dignified death which aged 90 I think she was entitled to. The report today says many other families are suffering. It describes harrowing cases including an elderly cancer patient who suffered 11+ unnecessary attempt to have a drip reinserted during his final hours alive. And a woman who was not given enough pain relief because of faulty equipment. The ombudsman ‘s office says it often receives reports of poor care in the final hours of life. It has investigated 265 such complaints in the past four years. It found just over half of them were in some wayjustified. And there were consistent themes in the problems that families suffered. For pain control, people being in unnecessary pain at the end of their lives. A lack of recognition that someone is dying and so not having conversations about their wishes when their life is coming to an end. And poor communication between NHS staff and families and patients. Hospices like this in north London offer a peaceful and sensitive environment for those final days that are so important to family. But all too often people are not able to die in a place of their choice. The report today says in some cases hospitals and GPs they’ll to talk to each other about a dying person ‘s care. Doctors and hospices believe the system needs to work much better for patients with terminal illnesses. Hospices are good at recognising when someone is dying so they can change gear and offer appropriate controls. Hospitals need to focus on end of life care as a priority because it is the right thing for patients. And it is the right thing for the health care system. The government agrees that the case highlighted by the ombudsman are appalling. NHS England says that improving services around the clock to help all patients from cradle to grave. -- the clock to help all patients from cradle to grave. -- will help all patients. You’re watching the BBC News at one. Our top story today. The boss of Thomas Cook apologises to the parents of the two children who died of carbon monoxide poisoning during a holiday in Corfu nine years ago. In a moment, Chris Fawkes will be here with a full national weather forecast - plus the news where you are. But first with all of the day’s sport, here’s Hugh Woozencroft at the BBC Sports Centre. The former 800 metre World Champion Caster Semenya has been speaking about her humiliation following the very public questioning of her gender in 2009 when she won gold in Berlin. In a rare interview the 21+ year old South African says she is now aiming to return to the top of her sport. Ben Smith went to meet her in Potchestfroom. Standing tall in the South African sunshine, Caster Semenya, an athlete at peace, a woman rebuilding her life and moving on from the past. She has got the gold medal! Six years ago she was a teenage world champion. A title she was never able to celebrate. Her gender was being questioned by millions. She was front-page news, abandoned by her sport. Now in a rare interview she reflected onjust how difficult sport. Now in a rare interview she reflected on just how difficult that time had been. Probably if not for mY time had been. Probably if not for my family I could not have survived it. It was a joke for me. When I grew up like that. I liked to be around boys. It has an effect. I cannot change it. It would be understandable winding back to that time, you feel upset by the way you were treated? of course it was upsetting. You feel humiliated. After an 11 month suspension, upsetting. You feel humiliated. Afteran 11 month suspension, she was cleared to run as a woman and although the gender test results were not made public, it is understood she was found to be intersects, having both male and female characteristics. Her career resumed with Olympic silver at London 2012 although many felt that she was scared of the scrutiny that might have come with the gold medal. How can you be scared, you want to win. I am a dreamer and I dream of becoming Olympic and world champion when I was older. So if you have a problem you have to come straight to me and tell me. I cannot stop because people saying, she looks like a man, this and that. It is their own problem, not my problem. What is clear is that Caster Semenya has stopped running from the past. Here in South Africa she remained an idol. Now the world waits to see if she could just go to -- idol. Now the world waits to see if she could just go to -- if she can be discovered the form that made her a champion. England have named a provisional squad for the Under-21 European Championship this summer. Spur’s striker Harry Kane has been included, Manchester united’s Luke Shaw hasn’t. Let’s go live to England’s St Georges Park and speak to our reporter David Ornstein. The make-up of past under 21 squads has often been shaped by the influence of club managers, is this one of them? on the surface it would seem so, there was no place the Ross Barkley, the likes of Raheem Sterling, Alex oxlade-Chamberlain. Nor law should -- Sterling, Alex oxlade-Chamberlain. Nor law should -- and there is no Luke Shaw, Gareth Southgate saying it was because of injury. But he was keen to come despite the wishes of Louis Van Gaal. Harry Kane, what a season he has had. The riskier Pochettino did not want him to go to this tournament but he is, and this will be a huge boost to England -- Mauricio Pochettino. Roy Hodgson said Gareth Southgate could pick whoever he wanted. England, in the last two editions of this tournament have gone out at the group stage and they will be hoping to do better this time around. England have named a 50 man training squad for the Rugby Union World Cup that starts in September. Chris Ashton is back in the frame. The Saracens wing hasn’t been involved since last summer. The squad will assemble next month six months after converting from Rugby League, Sam Burgess is also included. One of six uncapped players in the 50. Formula One World Champion Lewis Hamilton has signed another three-year contract to stay at Mercedes. His current deal runs out at the end of this season. He joined from Mclaren in 2013 and won the title with them last year. The deal is believed to be worth up to £27 million a year. Back to you. One of the wonders of the medieval world is back on display in Paris following seven years of meticulous restoration. The stained glass windows of Sainte Chapelle date back to the thirteenth century, and have now been revealed in all their glory after being cleaned pane by pane. Our Paris correspondent, Hugh Schofield reports. It is one of the jewels of French Gothic architecture, the stained glass is so rich and liked that the walls around barely seem to exist. But 750 years take their toll which is why piece by piece, the thousands of coloured panels, first installed by medieval craftsmen, have been taken out and cleaned. They were dirty. Because of all the weather effects from outside and also inside. Before they used to use a lot of candles in churches and the candle leaves smoke and the smog will go on the glass. The accumulated dust of centuries. They have also refreshed the paint and have removed lead joints, replacing them with glue to let in more light. And now after seven years of work, the restored windows have been put back so the public can see them once again in their full glory and imagine the extraordinary effect these illuminated images must have had on the religious mind of the 13th century. It was Louis IX, Saint Louis, who built the chapel to hold a relic. Christ’s crown of thorns. The windows tell biblical stories telling the power of Christian king. Now they have been renovated, we will be able to see the story that Louis IX wanted to tell us about religion and the French kingdom. It is a chance to gaze again at the wonder of the medieval world, today more beautiful than ever. Now we can get the weather, with a less than pretty picture. Turbulence yesterday, this was the scene outside james Bennett’s window. Storm clouds looming over the capital. Those storms turned out to be heavy with hail and thunder. Those storms were widespread. Looking at the run, this was sent by Nick Hall, showing a hailstone coming through. We had lively downpours out and about yesterday. The downpours were caused by a lump of cold air, being heated vigorously making the showers. As the colder moves away we will see milder air from the Atlantic which will have the added benefit of boosting temperatures. Also settling things down. This scene was sent earlier, thank you very much for that. Over the next few days things will be quieter and warmer. Before we get there, some showers left. Particularly over Eastern counties of England and East Anglia and the south-east prone to heavy showers this afternoon. You can see the sunshine, England, Wales and eastern Scotland doing the best. In the sunshine temperatures not so bad, 17 degrees in London. Cloudy in Northern Ireland and western Scotland with a weak weather front bringing rain. Amounts pretty small this afternoon. Overnight the weather front will get more active and we will see heavy rain pushing into the North West of Scotland. Cloudy in Northern Ireland and in England and Wales it will be dry with clear spells. Not particularly cold in towns and cities but chilly in the countryside with 1 degrees across southern England and Wales. Moving into Thursday ‘s charts, we will see this front bringing heavy rain into the Highlands and Argyll. Some spots of rain going into Aberdeenshire. White cloudy in Northern Ireland with some showers in the north-west, England and Wales will be dry with sunshine and it is starting to warm up -- will be dry with sunshine and it is starting to warm up -- quite cloudy. 20 degrees in London which is above average for the time of year. This weather front will move south bringing the risk of showers but with some sunny spells to the north and south. Temperatures in the south could get to 21 degrees on Friday. The weekend, Saturdays and looking too bad, high-pressure bringing quiet weather with sunshine. By Sunday a weak weather front will be pushing across the British Isles bringing rain with some sunshine either side. We are seeing quite a lot of your weather pictures, if you want to send some of yours, send them here: Thank you forjoining us. Nowa reminder of our top story this lunchtime. The boss of Thomas Cook has apologised to the parents of the children who died of carbon monoxide poisoning during a holiday in Corfu nine years ago. Christie and Bobbi Shepherd. That’s all from us, now on BBC One it’s time for the news where you are. Have a good afternoon. ~ -- Christi. Good afternoon and welcome to BBC London news. I’m Louisa Preston. A Metropolitan police officer who knocked a man’s tooth out with his riot shield during the 2010 student protests has been jailed for eight months. 36 year old PC Andrew Ott struck Royal Holloway student William Horner as he tried to break free from a kettled area on Parliament Square. Ott was found guilty yesterday of one count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, but cleared of perverting the course ofjustice. The judge said he had abused his power as a police officer. Figures obtained by BBC London show that more than fpeople were mugged for their bikes in London in the last year. The crime has become known as bike-jacking - and often involves cyclists being attacked by a group of people. One charity, which is teaching children as young as 9 to avoid the jackings, say they’re sometimes used by gangs as a way to initiate members. The word is given, go and get the bike from that guy, from someone and they go and interrogate the person. They are not trying to get the bike, they are looking for conflict. That is where a situation where a knife could get drawn. Rugby is trying to broaden its appeal and find a new audience in state schools. At Twickenham earlier today, for the Rugby World Cup.When the tournament kicks off this autumn, organisers not only hope for a successful tournament on the pitch but also want to take the sport to a new audience. Chris Slegg has been at the national stadium this morning The England and Fiji teams will be coming down this tunnel for the opening game of the World Cup. The England team has been named today, but also what will be happening here is the all schools team. They are looking to take this game to a new audience. This Ofsted report revealed over half of rugby professionals went to private school, comparing to only one intentional gin in the UK who are privately educated. -- intentional gin in the UK who are privately educated. -- one in ten. Earlier I spoke to a former England international. What we are pleased about is that most of the venues have been sold out. We want England to do well but nonetheless, we once when sure all of the venues are full. The all schools rugby event going on here today, rugby has this perception of still being perhaps elitist, something which has been levelled at it for years. How much have you seen that over the years? I went to secondary school in north London, Salisbury secondary school and rugby was not popular. I liked football, that was my main thing. What got me into it was my PE teacher, she was a female and she played rugby union, she said it would be great because rugby demonstrates the characteristics which helps you, discipline and respect and sportsmanship which has made a difference to my life. We will be hearing more from the England World Cup squad and perhaps, meeting some stars of the future. On the 6:30pm programme tonight. Now let’s get a full check on the weather forecast. Good afternoon, we started the day with pleasant sunshine and then the cloud and showers have followed. Showers will persist this afternoon, hopefully seeing bright spells and sunny spells between them. Working south and east through the course of the morning, not as lively as yesterday. Showers are not as heavy and not as frequent but still there nonetheless. Between them we should get brightness. The wind is lighter. It will feel a little bit warmer. Looking at a maximum of 17-18 degrees. These showers will persist this evening. Quite quickly they will die away. We will get a clear spell with temperatures dropping down. Quite chilly tonight, not as cold as last night. Minimum temperature of 6-7 degrees. It will be a bright start on Thursday. Thursday is not looking too bad. Plenty of sunny spells. Variable amount of cloud around. Coming and going. The wind is light and the temperature will feel a little bit warmer. Looking at a maximum of 19 - 20 degrees by the end of tomorrow. Heading through to Friday, and beyond, the all-important bank holiday weekend. It isn’t looking too bad. On Friday there is more cloud. Temperature sneaking up a couple of degrees, reaching 21 degrees by the end of the day. Saturday, a disappointing start with rain overnight but it will clear for the afternoon. That’s it for now - we’ll be back with our programme at 6.30 until ",,

And a charity says a third of Londoners are now struggling to afford a decent standard of living. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. Some of the world’s biggest banks have been fined billions of pounds for manipulating foreign currency rates. Barclays faces the biggest payout, of £1.5 billion. UBS, jP Morgan, Citigroup and the Royal Bank of Scotland were also fined. Traders used electronic chatrooms to manipulate exchange rates, making large profits at the expense of pension funds and companies. Here’s our business editor Kamal Ahmed. For London’s global banks, another day and another set of multi-billion pound fines, this time for ridding the foreign exchange market. Barclays was the main offender this time, facing a penalty from US and British regulators of £1.5 billion for its role in the scandal. US Attorney General, Loretta Lynch said the behaviour was brazen. Starting as early as 2007, currency traders at several multinational banks formed a group that they dubbed the cartel. It is perhaps fitting that they chose that name, as it aptly describes the brazenly illegal behaviour that they were engaged in on a five-year basis. So why does the foreign exchange market matter? It is used by global companies like supermarkets and car firms to change around the world. -- supermarkets and car firms to change around the world. -- trade around the world. Therefore it governs the price of millions of goods we buy and sell each year. If it is rigged, the price of those goods could be affected. The Royal Bank of Scotland, which is still majority-owned by the taxpayer, faced a fine of Âli30 million. Three other banks from America and Switzerland were also penalised. Hunched over trip trading, -- hunched over trading screens, anchors conspired to fix the rates. Another trader was told that if he messed up the manipulation, he should sleep with one eye open. A lawyer involved in taking action over previous manipulation of interest rates, LIBOR, expressed his shock. The extraordinary thing here is that at the very time that these banks are being fined for libel and telling the regulators that they were going to be good boys, down the corridor, they were fixing One. just remarkable. The bankers here know they are not yet out of the woods. To gain a true perspective, it is worth remembering that so far banks have paid out more than ÂlIo billion in misconduct charges since 2011, and those fines are likely to get higher and higher. Both Barclays and RBS and still facing investigations in America and the UK overtheir facing investigations in America and the UK over their behaviour during the financial crisis. And criminal prosecutions could follow for foreign exchange manipulation. Kamal Ahmed is with me now. What other banks saying in response to these extraordinary finds? This is Groundhog Day again, the public must be getting sick of hearing finds the misconduct at banks. The chief executives have come out with a very similar comments, incompatible with the banks, says Barclays. RBS said they strongly condemned the behaviour of a few traders. I think what you are seeing here is a real disconnect in banking. At the top, the new Chief Executive is a Barclays, Anthony jenkins, of Royal Bank of Scotland, Ross McEwan, have said we want the culture to change, but that culture is not getting right down to what I would describe as the front line, the traders who depend on this kind of manipulation to make their money. And until Ross McEwan and Anthony jenkins can really get down to the weeds of how banks operate, we could see many more days like this ahead. , Ahmed, thank you. The chief executive of Thomas Cook has said he is ""deeply sorry"" about the death of two British children on holiday in Corfu nine years ago. Christi and Bobby Shepherd, from West Yorkshire, died from carbon monoxide poisoning. Peter Fankhauser said today it was clear the company could have handled the tragedy better, and will meet the family tomorrow. Ed Thomas reports. This was Bobby and Christi Shepherd. And this was their final family holiday. They died here as carbon monoxide from a faulty boiler poisoned them as they slept. For nine years, their parents have blamed Thomas Cook and demanded answers. Thomas Cook put Christi and Bobby in that bungalow, and I will always hold Thomas Cook responsible for their deaths. Pressure has been building on Thomas Cook. I want to talk about the tragedy nine years ago in Corfu. And today, in front of his shareholders, its chief executive apologised. I am deeply sorry, as a father myself, about the tragic deaths of Bobby and Christi Shepherd in 2006 on a Thomas Cook holiday. The parents of these young children had accused of Cook of appalling behaviour. Thomas Cook of appalling behaviour. Only last week, the same chief executive who apologised on camera today came here to Wakefield’s corner’s court. At the inquest into Bobby and Christi Shepherd, in front of their parents, Peter Fankhauser refused to accept any blame. He said Thomas Cook had done nothing wrong. Then came more controversy. It’s emerged Thomas Cook received £3.5 million in compensation, much more than the children’s family. Today, Thomas Cook’s Chief Executive admitted they had got it wrong. It is absolutely clear that there are things we as a company could have done better during the last nine years. In particular, how we have conducted our relationship with the family. Bobby and Christi’s parents will meet Thomas Cook’s chief executive tomorrow, and finally, for themselves, here his apology. for themselves, hear his apology. Ed Thomas, BBC News, Wakefield. Prince Charles has made an emotional visit to Mullaghmore in Ireland, where his great uncle Lord Mountbatten was murdered by the IRA in 1979. Earlier, in a very personal speech, the Prince described Louis Mountbatten as the grandfather he never had, but said his death had helped him to understand the agonies borne by so many others. Our royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell is in Mullaghmore. That speech that the Prince delivered was one of the most powerfull delivered was one of the most powerful I have heard him deliver, the message that the pain of the past must be left behind. He walked along the seafront a few minutes ago. It was a very public walk full of very private thoughts and memories. Prince Charles walked along the seafront at Mullaghmore, greeted by crowds, past where Lord Mountbatten had kept his boat. Lord Mountbatten’s grandson was aboard the boat and survived, his twin brother killed. It was a dark time more than a generation ago. Back then, the Troubles produced many painful images, and these were some of the most haunting. The fragments of a boat being brought ashore after it had been blown apart by a bomb. The full ceremonial funeral through the streets of London. The Queen and the Royal family in black, morning one of their own, and a young prince, reading a lesson in Westminster Abbey. They would go down to the sea in ships. Today, nearly 36 years later, Charles made a heartfelt speech describing what the death of Lord Mountbatten had meant to him. In August 1979, my uncle Lord Matt Batten was killed alongside his grandson. At the time, I could not imagine how we would come to terms with the anguish of such a deep loss, since, for me, Lord Mountbatten represented the grandfather I never had. he went on to explain what the death had taught him. Through this dreadful experience, I now understand in a profound way the agonies borne by so many others in these islands of whatever faith, denomination or political tradition. At a church near Mullaghmore, Charles attended a service committed to peace and reconciliation, and attended by others touched by the tragedy. Three others died in the bombing apart from Lord Matt-- Mountbatten. But the images that will be remembered are of Prince Charles in Mullaghmore, sending the message that the violence is part of the past, not the future. Police are continuing to question nine men arrested in connection with the Hatton Garden safety deposit raid. The men, aged between A3 and 76, were detained yesterday during a string of raids in London and Kent. The contents of 56 safety deposit boxes, worth millions of pounds in total, were stolen over the Easter weekend. Daniel Sandford reports. The huge police forensics operation went right through a second day, while nine men aged A3 to 76 were still in custody. This was Riverside Gardens in Enfield with police officers visible inside. The home of lI8-year-old plane enthusiast Hugh Doyle, a plumber with an interest in yachting. He has a good reputation as a plumber, but is now being questioned about his alleged role in the Hatton Garden diamond heist. I can’t believe something like that, you know. They seem such lovely people. In Dartford, to the east of London, forensics officers were paying particular attention to some new buildings at the back of a large house. This is the home of Brian Reader, the oldest of the men being held, seen here in a picture from the 1980s. His son, Brian Reader, is also under arrest. The burglary of the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit was one of the most extraordinary heists of recent years. The thieves drilled through a thick concrete wall and emptied 56 boxes in a vault in the heart of London’s diamond district. Police say they found a large number of bags of what they called high-value items during one of the raids, which they say they are confident were some of the items stolen during the burglary that Easter bank holiday weekend. What’s not clear is what proportion of the missing items have been recovered. Delighted, shocked, surprised. We had written the whole thing off because the police had had so little reaction towards us and we thought at best they would capture part of the gang, but certainly not recover any property. But despite the intense forensics work continuing tonight across London, as yet, nobody has been charged. Daniel Sandford, BBC News. The Home Secretary has told police officers to stop ""crying wolf"" about budget cuts. Speaking at the annual conference of the Police Federation in Bournemouth, Theresa May gave an uncompromising speech in which she told delegates that, despite cuts in police numbers, crime had continued to fall. She also warned officers to expect further cuts and reforms in the years ahead. Inquests into the deaths of ten people who died at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport are to be reopened. Those who died were patients at the hospital during the time that jailed nurse Victorino Chua worked there. The Manchester South coroner said there was no immediate evidence that their deaths were caused by insulin poisoning. Chua was sentenced to a minimum of 35 years in prison for two murders on Monday. A midwife who worked at a failing maternity unit where 11 babies and one mother died has been struck off the profession’s register. Marie Ratcliffe is the first of six midwives from the Morecambe Bay NHS Trust to appear before a Nursing and Midwifery Council disciplinary panel. Our health correspondent Dominic Hughes has been speaking to one mother who lost her daughter. For Lesley Bennett, memories of her daughter, Elleanor, who died after being delivered at her local hospital, Furness General, are still strong more than a decade on. The bizarre thing is you can still smell her, well I can still smell her. Lesley’s midwife was Marie Ratcliffe. A disciplinary panel has now found her failures contributed to Elleanor’s death and, four years later, the death of another baby, Alex Brady. She’s only human, people make mistakes, but the error in her mistakes was my daughter’s life and another baby’s life. That’s unforgiva ble. She didn’t even say - hold her hands up and say, ""I’ve made a mistake, I’m sorry."" Marie Ratcliffe had already admitted all the charges she faced at the Nursing and Midwifery Council hearing. But a panel concluded she had shown unlimited evidence of remorse, she had an uncaring and unsympathetic approach, and her poor care not only put patients at risk, but caused actual harm to patients in her care. Marie Ratcliffe was dismissed from this hospital more than a year ago and the Trust that runs Furness General has undergone significant changes. And yet the bigger question remains - could the failures of care that occurred here with such devastating consequences happen somewhere else? Earlier this year, the Kirkup Report into Furness General found it was a lethal mix of failure that cost lives, from managers at the Trust, to regulators and the Department of Health itself. The Kirkup Inquiry has done a lot to lay all this out, to make people sit up and look and think it’s notjust a handful of parents that are very bitter because they lost a child, it’s not that, it’s because something really big was happening and mistakes were being covered over. I’d like to speak to Marie Ratcliffe about the NMC hearing... Marie Ratcliffe declined to be interviewed. She didn’t attend the disciplinary hearing but in a note said that she will regret what happened for the rest of her life. Dominic Hughes, BBC News, Barrow-in-Furness. Our top story this evening: Barclays fined £1.5 billion for their part in fixing exchange rates. And still to come: The cricket trophy at stake as England prepares to take on New Zealand tomorrow. Later on BBC London. An inquest hears how a British student made a ""terrified"" call to his mother shortly before being found dead on a German motorway. And broadening its appeal, rugby reaches out to find a new home in more state schools. Hundreds of migrants found by the BBC last week in a boat drifting off the coast of Thailand have been rescued by Indonesian fishermen. It’s believed about 6,000 people in total are adrift in the seas off Thailand and Malaysia. The boat we found set off several months ago from Myanmar and headed south, but failed to reach land. The migrants say their vessel was towed out to sea three times by the Thai and Malaysian navies, and that they then made their way to the island of Aceh in Indonesia. Our Asia correspondent, Martin Patience, has been meeting some of them after their rescue. This report contains some distressing images. They took to the sea to flee persecution and poverty. Most were in shock, hungry and exhausted. Women and children traumatised by months at sea. Fresh on shore, they finally found sanctuary. Their boat was first filmed off the coast of Thailand last week, but their cries for help went unanswered. Trapped on board, turned back by countries fearing a tide of refugees. But now migrants thanking the Indonesian fishermen who saved their lives. TRANSLATION: They looked half dead when we rescued them. They were so weak. There was no food, no water. We had to save them. The boat is now lying abandoned off the Indonesian coast. We boarded and discovered the awful conditions in the bowels of the ship. The migrants were forced to live below deck. The thing that strikes you here is the overwhelming stench, the stench of urine, it is sweltering hot and hundreds of migrants, men, women and children were crammed into these tight quarters, just imagine how horrific that must have been. Many of them thought they weren’t going to survive the journey. One of those was this man seen here shouting from the boat. Like many others, he was fleeing persecution. He is among the migrants to make it to Indonesia. He says he’s happy to be here after being rejected by Thailand and Malaysia. The migrants may now be safe, but they are still packed in together. They will be allowed to stay in Indonesia whilst seeking asylum in another country. Theirjourney is another country. Their journey is far from another country. Theirjourney is far from over. Martin Patience, BBC News, Indonesia. Fighters from the so-called Islamic State are reported to be closing in on the ancient city of Palmyra, one of the Middle East’s greatest archaeological sites. They’re understood to have taken control of parts of the neighbouring modern city, and many residents have fled. 4,000 years old, Palmyra is a world heritage site, and Syrian authorities have been trying to rescue artefacts from the city’s museums. Police investigating historic sexual abuse allegations have revealed that more than 1,400 suspects have been investigated, including 76 politicians and nearly 200 other well-known people. Many of the victims claim they were attacked in schools, hospitals or children’s homes. Our correspondent Tom Symonds is in central London. Explain what the police have been saying. These figures are from a team based in this non-descript office here, that is coordinating the police response to child abuse. 1,433 suspects is the number of men who they say they have on their computer database. It is the number for prominent individuals which will get the most attention - for prominent individuals which will get the most attention - 261 prominent individuals, including 76 politicians, local and national, more than 140 people from the TV, radio and film industries, 43 from music industries and 7 from the world of sport. The police say these are quite often allegations that are fairly new about offences that may have taken place in the past. They are taking them seriously, they say, but they say it is also putting forces under a great deal of pressure because there is a lot of work that goes into doing these investigations. Thank you. Marks & Spencer has announced its first rise in annual profits for four years. It reported a 6.1% increase in pre-tax profits, to just over £660 million. The chief executive, Marc Bolland, says clothing is one area which is now showing signs of significant improvement. Our business correspondent Emma Simpson has more. Is this the skirt that will deliver a revival in women’s fashion at Marks & Spencer? It only went on sale last week. Cheap it ain’t, but thousands of women have already signed up for this, thanks to all the buzz. The fashion press loved it and so did a few celebrities. Marks has spent a lot of time and money improving its fashion credentials. Women’s clothing is crucial to its success. For the first time in four years, these sales have started to rise. But what’s really driven profits today is better deals with its suppliers. So, are investors convinced? We’ve seen in the last three months the first signs of positive sales growth. For me, the question is whether that’s a flash in the pan, or whether that can be sustained into the future. For that to be a sunny one, there’s a fundamental challenge to overcome. Over a third of the customers are over 65, so they need to start getting young customers through the door. Now, they are going to do that by still having the clothes for their loyal customers, but they need to have young, exciting collections for younger people and they will have to deliver that season after season. So, what about the latest collection? One suede skirt carefully folded. The skirt has brought me back to M&S. I’m not a regular M&S shopper! Would you buy anything else in there? I did see a really nice dress in the video. I come here for lunch, but apart from that, that is as far as my M&S shopping goes. Getting customers through the door for its food has never been a problem. Strong sales boosted profits. But it’s the clothing aisles that really count. For the year as a whole, these sales were still below expectations. But the boss believes Marks is heading in the right direction. Emma Simpson, BBC News. English cricket has, in the words of the captain, taken a hammering in recent months. Tomorrow - on the field - the season begins with a Test match against New Zealand. Alastair Cook today denied he was behind the decision to block the return of Kevin Pietersen. joe Wilson reports from Lord’s. The sign at Lord’s is aimed at spectators, not England’s cricketers. The team starts the summer without those perceived to hinder, so no Kevin Pietersen, who is not trusted, no Peter Moores, the coach, sacked, and not yet replaced. What’s left is this team. As captain, Alastair Cook knows he takes responsibility for almost everything, so did he insist it’s either Pietersen or me? There was no ultimatum. I can deny that. I don’t know where that came from. But to be honest with you, over the last 15 months, the story has not gone away. Are you content with the fact that you weren’t consulted or did you want it to be that way? I want it to be that way. Here at Lord’s, England are playing against a team on the rise, a nation of four million which reached cricket’s World Cup Final. Take a look at New Zealand. A team which has rebuilt its values. When you can dare to start a new... An advertising campaign this year in New Zealand tried to remind people of the romance of cricket. How we were viewed two years ago is we were overpaid and undelivering. England will talk to an Australian coach aboutjoining them to beat will talk to an Australian coach about joining them to beat Australia later this summer. For now, New Zealand. Before the Ashes, isn’t there always fire? joe Wilson, BBC News, Lord’s. Time for a look at the weather with Matt Taylor. It is looking good for the Test. A fine night tonight, but we still have a few heavy showers at the moment across parts of Lincolnshire and East Anglia. We do have more cloud in the north-west of the UK, particularly for Scotland. Here, we will see some rain and drizzle turning persistent later in the night. It won’t be as chilly as recent nights. The coldest conditions will be towards the South East tomorrow morning. It will soon warm up. A fine start for much of England and Wales. More cloud for Scotland and Northern Ireland. The most persistent of the rain will be in the north-west Highlands. A bit more cloud across England and Wales into the afternoon. The vast majority of you will stay dry through Thursday. It will feel warmer than recent days, highs of 20 degrees is possible in the South East corner. The rain in the north-west is due to this weather front which will edge southwards. The rain around it decays, the best of the brightest weather will be towards the east of the country. In any sunshine, it will feel again quite warm, if not humid. That takes us into the start of the bank holiday weekend. Saturday is looking like the sunniest and warmest day of the weekend. Temperatures around 15 to 20 Celsius. Sunday, expect more cloud and rain. But the rain will be fairly short-lived for the weekend. Any showers on Monday will be few and far between. Most will have a dry and fine bank holiday weekend. That’s all from the BBC News at Six, so it’s goodbye from me, and on BBC One we nowjoin the BBC’s news teams where you are. On the programme tonight.

Coming up later in the programme. London museums get nearly £30 million to help preserve Britain’s scientific history. The mother of a man whose body was found an adjournment motorway in an apparent suicide 12 years ago has told an inquest that he sounded terrified during that last phone call. Erica Duggan’s sonjeremiah was in Golders Green for a conference in Germany. The police recorded his death as a suicide but his mother has always believed there was foul play. At 22 years old, jeremiah was studying in Paris. He had a girlfriend and was in love. He was such a happy young man, and so lively, so cheerful. In March 2003, he travelled to Germany to a conference organised by the movement. In the early hours of the 27th, he was found dead on a motorway. He was apparently hit by two cars and police said it was suicide. His parents were never convinced and in 2010, the High Court ordered a fresh UK inquest. Over the last two days, two separate witnesses have told the inquest that a sandy substance was found on jeremiah’s body and both vehicles. This morning, forensic scientists said it was possible that he was killed at a quarry or in a builder 's yard, then his body moved to a road and accident staged. He went on to say there was no chase of tissues on the car that hitjerry to say there was no chase of tissues on the car that hit jerry and on the car that hitjerry and he might have been chased and beaten to death before his body had been moved. His motheralso death before his body had been moved. His mother also told the coroner about a phone call he received before he was found dead. It is a terrible phone call, he sounded as if his life was in danger, he sounded like that, I had no doubt. I rang 909 immediately because I could sense and hear that. And I still hear him. Andrew Walker asked Erica Duggan, what you happened? Whether he was killed by the cars or not, if he had not left Paris or not been with the people, he would be alive today. The coroner’s verdict is expected this week. jeremiah’s family say they have waited 12 years and still do not know the truth. One in three Londoners are struggling to afford a decent standard of living. That’s according to the charity Trust for London, which says it costs up to 50% more to reach a decent living standard in London compared to the rest of the UK, mainly due to the high cost of transport, housing and childcare. With more details, here’s Katharine Carpenter. How much money do you need to live a decent life here in the capital? 25 grand a year, probably, something like that, I would say. About 40,000. About 60 grand a year, maybe more, just depends. To have a decent life here, to actually be able to afford to have a social life and eat and drink and whatever else, I would say about 60k. The charity Trust for London has funded some proper research onthis. It’s looked at what it costs Londoners to meet their basic needs and to engage in social activities such as a cheap meal out twice a month, or being able to buy a child’s birthday present. The research found that a single person in inner London needsjust over £21,000 per year. That’s 47% more than someone outside the capital. A couple with two children need £46,748, that’s 25% more than elsewhere. And a couple who are pensioners have to budget for £23,660 a year. That’s nearly a third more than those in other parts of the country. Even if you work 40 hours a week on the so-called London living wage, you won’t get close to that. The researchers say any increase in earnings simply haven’t kept pace with the increase in the cost of child care, housing and transport. They say it means that one in three Londoners is falling short. Families with children are the hardest hit. Nearly half of them are struggling to make ends meet. Rosie Walker says the cost of living is one of the reasons she has delayed starting a family. You never know, sort of, if you can cover the next bill. And you don’t know what you’re going to be earning in six months’ time or a year’s time. So I think that affects your relationships a lot, it affects the way you relate to your neighbourhood and the community. City Hall told us the mayor has already introduced policies to boost wages, employment and the number of low-cost homes. Trust for London says that’s not enough. We need action by employers, in terms of playing better wages. We need action by government to ensure that benefit and tax credits to supplement wages are adequate, and we also need action by government in terms of bringing down costs. Of course, there are plenty of people across the rest of the country who also fall below this minimum income standard. But there is a higher price to pay for life in the capital. A Metropolitan police officer who knocked a man’s tooth out with his riot shield during the 2010 student protests has been jailed for eight months. 36 year-old Andrew Ott struck student William Horner as he tried to break free from a kettled area on Parliament Square. The officer was found guilty yesterday of assault but cleared of perverting the course ofjustice. Health bosses in west London has said that the maternity unit in Ealing Hospital will close on the 1st ofjuly. The announcement comes despite a long local campaign, with protesters claiming care would suffer. The NHS says mothers and babies would get better treatment at other hospitals in the area and said it would write to all women affected. Applications to be Labour’s candidate for the next mayor of London have closed today. A total of eight people have applied for the role including former Olympics minister Tessa jowell, Tooting MP Sadiq Khan, Tottenham MP David Lammy and Hackney MP Diane Abbott. Harrow MP Gareth Thomas and Transport writer Christian Wolmar have also applied. London museums are to get nearly £30 million to help preserve Britain scientific history. It’s part of a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund, and one of the venues that will benefit is the Science Museum where we canjoin Alice Bhandhukravi who can tell us more. That’s right, I’m in the heart of London’s Museum Quarter in South Kensington. One of its star attractions, the science Museum behind me. It is the number one destination for school groups in the whole country. Last year, they had 3.3 million visitors and now they are getting £8 million worth of lottery funding which they are going to be specifically investing in their medical collection. I visited it earlier. This is the actual medical kit used by the explorer Dr Livingstone, just one of the precious artefacts housed in the medical galleries. They chart the history of pioneering innovation, from the crudest tools of the 18th century to the sophisticated and sanitised of the late 20th. In essence, they tell the story of pain and cure, of birth and death. But the way they tell those stories, with their darkened dioramas and stilted models, now look dated. This is indeed a state of the art museum display from the 1980s. And it was absolutely right in its day. This was the state-of-the-art operating theatre of its day. There is an opportunity now to make a new generation of medicine galleries that should be internationally renowned, because our medicine galleries are amongst the largest and most significant in the world. As is typical of many museums, the Science Museum only has 8% of its collection actually on display. So a new injection of cash will mean the medical galleries can OCCUpy f8I’ ITIOFE SPBCE. Most of the first floor here, meaning lots more will go on show when they open in four years’ time. The renovation project will cost £24 million and so far, they’ve only secured 18 million. But the hope is other donors will come forward, so that the medical galleries can continue to illustrate just how far we’ve come. The Science Museum isjust one beneficiary from this lottery funding. There are other scientific institutions in London benefiting as well. The lesser-known Geffrye Museum in East London is going to get £11 million of funding and the British library is being given £9.5 million, which it will spend on digitising the night-- macro nation’s sound recordings. Overall a good day for the science profession. Still to come tonight. The homeless book critic who’s become the subject of his own plot twist. And broadening its appeal, rugby reaches out to find a new home in state schools. Train operators are warning passengers to avoid travelling next Monday and Tuesday if the rail strike goes ahead. Train companies say most services will be severely affected with some trains not running at all. Our correspondent Tom Edwards is at Kings Cross for us now. So some indication of the scale of the disruption? Yes, we havejust been given a glimpse of the level of services that operators are going to be able to run on Monday and Tuesday next week if this strike goes ahead and I have to say, it is not pretty at all. Virgin West Coast say they are going to run no service, virgin east coast say only a limited number of trains, Southwest trains, no services on Tuesday, the list goes on. South Eastern, severely impacted. First Great Western, a reduced service. Chilton, probably no service on Tuesday, and C2C, passengers should avoid travel on Monday. Probably we will get the full details of what trains they will be able to run on Saturday. In terms of resolving the issue, however talks going? We have been getting some positive noises from the talks that are still going on at the moment. The chair of Network Rail has put out a statement saying, we believe there is a settlement to be had. Positive noises there. The RMT have said they are pushing for a negotiated settlement. Both sides have said that they will be willing to continue these talks might sue the weekend. So perhaps there are some grounds for optimism still for commuters. You never know. He’s known as the homeless book critic and can be found sleeping rough outside a tube station in south west London. Over the past few weeks commuters have been giving him books so he can blog his own literary reviews. But today there’s been a dramatic twist to the story after he got into a spot of trouble with the police. Alex Bushill reports from Parsons Green. This is a tale with a twist. Meet Mark Burns, the homeless books critic. He has become a bit of a local hero, camped outside Parsons Green tube station, commuters donating books to read and review. Handwritten, a local student then post them online for him. He lost his partner, three children, job and home after becoming a heroin addict. Now he is addicted to the written word. The name of the book was the woods and the author was Harlan Colburn. I said it was an eight. I give this ten out of ten. Chris Ryan was seven out of ten. People come up to me say, I have seen your blog, taking pictures of me. I have had people ask for my autograph. Butjust after we stopped filming yesterday, dramatic twist in the plot. Mark Burns said he was then arrested for vagrancy and spent the afternoon in the cells. In a statement, the police deny that Mark Burns was ever arrested. They say he was merely asked to move on. Because he chose to leave his books where he was found, they were then handed into a local charity shop by the officers involved. No one knows why the police acted when they did but today, he was gone. There are those who have been complaining for weeks about his pop up library, lead up to get their back garden wall. On the other side lives Audrey, and here is her unabridged version. I don’t think anybody would be happy with someone of their back door that can climb over the wall get into their home. It is very insecure. Outside the station, the other side of the story, this lunchtime a modest demo from his supporters and what story would be without a celebrity endorsement. If they are not have the community, and he was not, he was friendly, why keep him out? There is no need. Mark made a brief appearance for his epilogue. I think it is a joke, Ido nothing wrong, I sit here and read a book, Ido not cause problems, I keep the alleyway clean, everyone likes me. He says if he stays any longer than four hours for now on he will be arrested, reading his days of long leisurely read baby over. -- reading his days of long leisurely read baby over. -- reads may be over. London is continuing to attract a record number of foreign visitors since the 2012 Olympics. New figures show that more 17 million tourists came to London last year and they’re spending more than ever before. What London 2012 showcased to the world is what a beautiful, amazing capital London is. It’s one of the capitals of culture in the world, last year was a bumper year, so you had the Matisse Cut-outs at the Tate, where hundreds of thousands of people flocked. You had the poppies at the Tower of London where 5 million people went. So those blockbuster exhibitions are really driving tourism as well. Next, the question of how to get more pupils from state schools into top flight rugby. The sport, which is still seen by many as elitist, is trying to broaden its appeal. Today, 12 state schools were invited to play on the very pitch where the Rugby World Cup kicks off in 121 days time. From Twickenham, Chris Slegg reports. Come this autumn’s World Cup, Twickenham should feel like an imposing place for visiting teams. Today, though, it threw down the welcome mat to pupils from state schools as part of All Schools day. Around one in ten children in this country are privately educated, but this report published by Ofsted last summer revealed that more than half of premiership Rugby players went to private school. It’s hoped that events like this one at Twickenham today and the Rugby World Cup here this autumn will help take the game to a new audience. In a career which saw him win 114 caps and the World Cup for England, jason Leonard broke down opponents and notions of elitism. I come from a state school background, we had a Welsh PE teacher turn up and basically said to all of us as kids, we were all in our football kit, he said, I can see by the school curriculum you don’t play rugby. We said, that’s right. He said, you will be next year. Inside Twickenham, head coach Stuart Lancaster was busy naming the players whose performances for England it is hoped will inspire a generation. The 50 man World Cup training squad will of course be whittled down, but it now contains a notable pair from Saracens. Wing Chris Ashton, recalled at the age of 28 after missing out on the last 2 6 Nations, and 20-year-old forward merit Maro Itjoe is included after impressing in his debut season. I think it’s great, Stuart Lancaster has gone for a mix of young versus very experienced and some people that we haven’t seen for a while. As for rugby’s potential future stars, well, Twickenham was an instant hit. This, Iam just, wow. I haven’t had a chance to play in a big arena like this. Whatever England achieve this autumn, rugby won over some new fans today. They may have inspired great poems and paintings but our waterways have long been ignored as platforms for art. Over the last decade this has changed dramatically with rivers and canals playing host to a broad range of Canals and rivers have long been a source of inspiration for artists and there is a rich tradition of great art associated with the waterways. Tide, Londoner Simon Tarrant’s latest exhibition at the London Canal Museum, reflects this. I had an idea to do an exhibition for the last couple of years and a lot of the paintings I do are about the sea and the water around us. So I wanted to find a place to reflect that. So I came up with the idea of a water related venue and looked across London, I couldn’t find anything suitable until I came to the London Canal Museum which is actually on the Regents Canal. The canal is very much a getaway place, a place of leisure, a green corridor through London. So you can see why it inspires artists. This summer, the Canal and River trust have expanded their art on the waterways programme with more commissions and events than ever before. Using the waterways as cultural capillaries. Ambitions include a world-class sculpture hall by the River Lee, a theatre project with the Royal Shakespeare Company and teenagers from Stratford, and a floating cinema travelling from London to Bristol. We have been blown away by the number and range of different artists that have been inspired by this programme and want to do things on the water. So we have had comedians, writers, poets, we have had theatre, we have had sculptures, sculptors. And film producers as well, so this year has been our best year on record on the waterways with everything from TV programmes and advertising but also big budget shoots like james Bond and Mission Impossible. Our historic canals, rivers and docks provide extraordinary public and cultural spaces. These projects are about working with artists to engage communities in new ways to appreciate the wonder and importance of our waterways while creating great art in the process. Now, not sure what is going on with the weather at the moment. Chris is the man to tell us. Hopefully some good news? |t’ll It’ll quiet down, keep the Faith! Lets look at this class which -- classic shot of the thundercloud yesterday, it has been a cold day today, but look at this, we get a iump up today, but look at this, we get a jump up in temperatures as we get to the next few days. Temperatures back UP the next few days. Temperatures back up into the 20s so it’ll start to feel warmer. up into the 20s so it’ll start to feelwarmer. One feel warmer. One or two showers around today but the Lions share of the showers were in East Anglia and Essex. Some thunderstorms here, missing London. It will be a fine evening with plenty of sunshine for the next hour or so. The winds are staying light, it will not be put to cold in the centre of town. Into the countryside, a few spots get to 2 degrees. Cold enough for a little bit of frost on the grass. Tomorrow, better prospects weather-wise, another dry day for most of us with sunny spells and it is set to get warmer. For most of us after the chilly starch to the day we will keep sunny spells through the morning and afternoon, with small amounts of cloud coming and going. The winds. Light, and the temperatures will climb to 20 degrees in the centre of town. -- the winds will stay light. On Friday, a carbon copy repeat, another dry day with some sunshine as well. A little bit more cloud but temperatures doing pretty well. Highs of 21, and that is above average for the time of year. Looking ahead to the all-important weekend, the fine and dry spell of weather looks set to continue. Sunny spells and mainly dry through the weekend, there is a risk of some rain right at the end of the day on Sunday. Essentially a pretty good weekend to look forward to. The main headlines before we go. Five of the world’s largest banks have been fined more than three and a half billion pounds for manipulating exchange markets. Barclays is paying the biggest LP, £1.5 billion. The Chief Executive of Thomas Cook has said he was deeply sorry about the carbon monoxide poisoning of two children who died nine years ago while on holiday in Corfu. He said it was clear the company could have handled the tragedy better. Police are continuing to question nine men in connection with the Hatton Garden rain. The men aged between 43 and 76 were detained yesterday in a string of raids in London and Kent. And more than 500 people were mugged for their bikes in the last year in London.

Those of us who love Game of Thrones will know all about Brienne of Tarth played by actress Gwendoline Christie. She is the fearsome female knight who is the match for any of the male ordersmen in the show. This is unbelievable what you will see. Tonight we meet a real-life Brienne as she prepares to take on all comers whilst looking after her rather noisy baby, of course. Ah! Oooh, what have we here? Mr Bump and the Knight. Mr Bump was thoroughly fed up. It did not seem to matter what he did he always ended up getting bumped and bruised and scraped and scratched. You want to get to the good bit, do you? Mr Bump rushed to the black Smiths to buy himself a suit of armour. Is that like daddy’s and mummy’s helmet. Yeah?

When you are in full armour, you have everything on, ready to fight I go into a different zone. I’m nota mummy, I’m a fighter. To get into that head space is relaxing, in a strange way! Now, said Mr Bump opening the book, what do knights do? In full contact medieval fighting you can kick, punch, headbutt. The weapons may be blunt, but they are very real and they hurt. To win you must use speed and stamina to strike your opponent, or use brute force to knock them to the ground. It’s been a challenge for myself, obviously getting back to fitness after having a baby. She doesn’t leave a lot of time for getting fit. It’s important that your cardio is up to scratch. You need to be able to breathe properly when you are in armour for quite ",,
93,BBC1 London,20-may-2015,BBC News at Ten,22:00,25 mins,True,"Tonight at ten, six of the world’s largest banks are fined billions of pounds for manipulating foreign exchange rates. Barclays must pay the biggest sum, £1.5 billion. The US attorney general says the bankers’ behaviour created many victims. Their actions inflated the banks’ profits while harming countless consumers, investors and institutions around the globe. We’ll be examining the impact of this latest banking scandal. Also tonight, the little boy among hundreds of migrants rescued after two months on boat off Thailand. He’s now safe, but so many like him are not. For the thousands of people still stranded out there at sea, living in cramped, filthy and dangerous boats exactly like this, there is still no active plan to either find them or rescue them. Nine years after the holiday death of Christi and Bobby Shepherd, a first full apology from Thomas Cook.

Good evening. Some of the world’s biggest banks have been fined billions of pounds for manipulating foreign currency rates. Barclays faces the biggest payout of £1.5 billion. UBS, jP Morgan, Citigroup, Bank of America and the Royal Bank of Scotland were also fined. Traders used electronic chatrooms to manipulate exchange rates, making large profits at the expense of pension funds and companies. Here’s our Business Editor Kamal Ahmed. For London’s global banks, another day and another set of multi-billion pound fines, this time for rigging the foreign exchange market. Barclays was the main offender this time, facing a penalty from US and British regulators of £1.5 billion for its role in the scandal. The US Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, said the behaviour was ""brazen."" Starting as early as 2007, currency traders, at several multinational banks, formed a group that they dubbed ‘The Cartel’. It’s perhaps fitting that they choose that name, as it aptly describes the brazenly illegal behaviour that they were engaged in on a near five-year basis. So why does the foreign exchange market matter? It is used by global companies, like supermarkets and car firms, to trade around the world. It, therefore, governs the price of millions of goods we buy and sell each year. If it is rigged, the price of those goods could be affected. The Royal Bank of Scotland, which is still majority owned by the taxpayer, faced a fine of EABO million. Four other banks from America and Switzerland were also penalised. Hunched over trading screens, bankers colluded to make more money for themselves and their banks. One group of traders were known as ‘The Three Musketeers’ another 'The Cartel’. In internet chatrooms, one banker said, ""if you ain’t cheating, you ain’t trying."" Another trader was told that if he messed up the manipulation, he should, ""sleep with one eye open."" A lawyer who’s involved in taking action over previous manipulation of interest rates, LIBOR, expressed his shock. The extraordinary thing here is, at the very time that these banks were being fined for LIBOR and telling the regulators that they were going to be good boys, down the corridor they were fixing forex. just remarkable. Despite the huge fines today, banks here in the City of London and down the river at Canary Wharf know they are not yet out of the woods. To gain a true perspective, it’s worth remembering that so far banks have paid out more than EAO billion in misconduct charges since 2011 and those fines are likely to get higher and higher. The chief executives of both Barclays and RBS strongly condemned the traders’ behaviour and criminal charges could follow, but with more investigations ahead, we have not seen the last of multi-billion pound fines for what, in the end, is corruption. Kamal Ahmed, BBC News. Hundreds of migrants found by the BBC last week in a boat drifting off the coast of Thailand have been rescued by Indonesian fishermen. It’s believed a total of about 6,000 people are adrift in the seas off Thailand and Malaysia. The boat set off several months ago from Myanmar and headed south but failed to reach land. The migrants say their vessel was towed out to sea three times by the Thai and Malaysian navies and that they then made their way to Aceh in Indonesia. Our Asia correspondent, Ian Pannell, has been meeting some of them, after their rescue. Lost in the Andaman Sea, thousands of migrants from Myanmar, abandoned by the countries of the region and stranded at sea for weeks. We knew they would come down in this direction, they would hit the coastline in Thailand. Some of them have come across to Indonesia but there is such a vast body of water out there, it is almost impossible to find out where they are. Somewhere down below was one boat with hundreds of people on board last seen by the BBC off the coast of Thailand. But in the end it was the kindness of strangers that saved them. They were rescued by local fishermen and brought ashore. Exhausted, malnourished and dehydrated. This was the last time they had been seen, almost a week ago. They pleaded for help, without food, water or the compassion of their fellow man. In the end they were given some supplies, their boat was fixed and they were ordered back to sea. Amongst them was this boy, he had been on the water for two months with his mother and baby brother, an eight-year-old boy desperately crying out to be fed. This was him today, safe, clean and fed. He looked at the photo of him last week and described how he felt. I’m sad, he said, I want to cry. This was where he lived for two months. Cramped in the filth and squalor of a boat built for dead fish. Packed in with hundreds of others. Malaysia and Indonesia have now said they will offer temporary shelter to the migrants but only on the condition that the international community also agrees to repatriate or resettle them within one year. For the thousands of people still stranded out there at sea, living in cramped, filthy and dangerous boats exactly like this one, there is still no active plan to either find them or rescue them. Now, forecasters predict the start of the monsoon season and the chance of a cyclone heading this way. Unless someone helps the other migrants to shore, hundreds of people may die. The UN calls the Rohingya Muslims one of the most persecuted minorities in the world. Victims of communal violence with the Buddhist neighbours. It is desperation that reads children like this lying on the floor in a foreign land. Her mother says her husband was killed by Buddhists and without jobs or money, she took the risk to come here. Tonight, her children are without a father, a country or a home. The chief executive of Thomas Cook, Peter Fankhauser, has said he is ""deeply sorry"" about the death of two British children on holiday in Corfu in 2006. Christi and Bobby Shepherd from West Yorkshire died from carbon monoxide poisoning. Mr Fankhauser also told the BBC that the company should have shown the family more compassion over the last nine years. He will meet the children’s parents tomorrow. Ed Thomas reports. This was Bobby and Christi Shepherd, and this was their final family holiday. They died here as carbon monoxide from a faulty boiler poisoned them as they slept. For nine years, their parents have blamed Thomas Cook and demanded answers. Thomas Cook put Christi and Bobby in that bungalow, and I will always hold Thomas Cook responsible for their deaths. Pressure has been building on Thomas Cook. I want to talk about the tragedy nine years ago in Corfu. Today, in front of his shareholders, its chief executive apologised. I’m deeply sorry, as a father myself, about the tragic deaths of Bobby and Christi Shepherd in 2006 on a Thomas Cook holiday. The parents of these young children had accused Thomas Cook of appalling behaviour. Only last week, the same chief executive, who apologised on camera today, came here to Wakefield’s coroners court. At the inquest into Bobby and Christi Shepherd, in front of their parents, Peter Fankhauser refused to accept any blame. He said Thomas Cook had done nothing wrong. Then came more controversy. It emerged Thomas Cook received £3.5 million in compensation, much more than the children’s family. Today, Thomas Cook’s chief executive admitted they got it wrong. It is absolutely clear that there are things we, as a company, could have done better during the last nine years. In particular, how we have conducted our relationship with the family. Bobby and Christi’s parents will meet Thomas Cook’s chief executive tomorrow and finally, for themselves, hear his apology. Ed Thomas, BBC News, Wakefield. Police say more than 250 men, who’ve played a prominent role in public life are under investigation by police looking at historical allegations of child sex abuse. Among the suspects are more than 70 politicians and twice as many men working in TV, film, radio and music. In all, the inquiry has, so far, identified more than 1,430 suspects. The Home Secretary has told police officers to stop ""crying wolf"" about budget cuts. Speaking at the annual conference of the Police Federation in Bournemouth, Theresa May gave an uncompromising speech in which she told delegates that despite cuts in police numbers, crime had continued to fall. She also warned officers to expect further cuts and reforms in the years ahead. Prince Charles has made an emotional visit to Mullaghmore in Ireland, where his great uncle, Lord Mountbatten, was murdered by the IRA in 1979. Earlier, in a very personal speech, the Prince described Louis Mountbatten as the grandfather he never had, but said his death had helped him to understand the agonies borne by so many others. Our Royal correspondent, Nicholas Witchell, reports from Mullaghmore. APPLAUSE. It was a very public walk, full of very private thoughts and memories. Prince Charles walked along the seafront at Mullaghmore greeted by the crowds, past the harbour where Lord Mountbatten had boarded his boat on that final, fatefuljourney. With him was Timothy Knatchbull, Lord Mountbatten’s grandson. He was aboard the boat. He survived, his twin brother, Nicholas, was killed. I’m so pleased to meet you, today of all days. For so many, the visit will have re-kindled memories of a dark time, more than a generation ago. Back then, the Troubles produced many painful images, these were some of the most haunting. The fragments of a boat being brought ashore after it been blown apart by a bomb. The pomp of a full ceremonial funeral through the streets of London. The Queen and the Royal Family in black, mourning one of their own, and a young Prince reading a lesson in Westminster Abbey. They that go down to the sea in ships... Today, nearly 36 years after those events, Charles made a heartfelt speech describing what the death of Lord Mountbatten had meant to him. At the time, I could not imagine how we would come to terms with the anguish of such a deep loss since, for me, Lord Mountbatten represented the grandfather I never had. He went on to explain what the death had taught him. Through this dreadful experience though I now understand, in a profound way, the agonies borne by so many others in these islands. The bomb on Lord Mountbatten’s boat killed him and two other members of his family. There was a fourth victim, a 15-year-old local boy, Paul Maxwell. His mother says she hopes anyone who is still ambivalent about violence will heed Prince Charles’ words and move on. I hope that they can see that he is stretching out the hand of friendship and being forgiving, and I hope that they also can do the same. That they can stretch out the hand of friendship and that they also can find it in their hearts to forgive. It can sometimes be difficult to read the message of a Royal visit, but not this time. The speech he gave earlier, like his visit to this little village, have both conveyed the same very clear message - that it is time to leave behind the pain and the enmity of the past. Or, put another way, the men of violence have no place in Ireland’s future. Nicholas Witchell, BBC News, Mullaghmore. Fighters from so-called Islamic State have taken control of the Syrian city of Palmyra, home to one of the Middle East’s greatest archaeological sites. Within the past hour, Syrian state television has reported that government forces have withdrawn, after getting most civlia ns out safely. But there are fears that the nearby ancient city could be destroyed by IS forces. Our world affairs correspondent, Caroline Hawley, is with us. What’s the latest? This is a desperate situation. What is happening? IS swept in from the east. There has been fighting for several days. They have taken the city. We spoke to a resident inside Palmyra saying IS had been handing out food and water in an attempt to win hearts and minds. It’s a strategically important city. It’s home to a big military base. The reason the outside world heard of it is because of the amazing ruins you just saw. 2,000 years old. A World Heritage Site of immense cultural significance to the world. Now, statures have been removed from the ancient city, according to Syrian officials. There are still very, very big fierce because of what IS fighters have done to the archaeological sites in Iraq they have taken over. There is the wider alarm that despite all the efforts being put into containing IS into fighting IS, that they were able to take first Ramadi in Iraq in the past few days and now Palmyra. Caroline. Thank you. Caroline Hawley. The Chancellor, George osborne, has told business leaders that Europe is sleepwalking into a future where it’s priced itself out of the global economy. Speaking to the CBI business group, Mr osborne said this was why the EU had to change. Tonight, one of Europe’s biggest companies warned of the risk to investment if Britain were to leave the EU after a referendum. Our deputy political editor, james Landale, reports. From the moment we watched Ted Heath sign us up, Britain’s had an uneasy relationship with the European Union. More than Ao years on, and many new members later, it’s a relationship that’s under scrutiny as never before. Tonight, at a business dinner in London, the man who will negotiate that new relationship, before a referendum in the next two years, explained why Europe had to change. The continent is sleepwalking towards a future where it has priced itself out of the global economy with its rules and its regulations, financial services legislation and red tape. Any referendum may be 18-months away, but already the pro-EU business group, the CBI, is urging firms to speak out in favour of staying in. Tonight, the aerospace giant, Airbus, warned of the risks if Britain left. What we are talking about is the future and future investment. We need that competitive economic environment between all of our home nations, all of our operations, and therefore, if the UK were not part of the EU, would we have to reconsider future investment? The answer is, yes, we would. So what are the reforms the Government’s looking for? Well, it wants Britain to opt-out of the EU’s promise of an ever closer union. It wants to protect the single market from decisions made by Eurozone countries. It wants to make it harder for EU migrants to claim benefits. It wants national parliament’s to have greater powers to block EU legislation. All this could require changes to the EU treaties. Today, there were mixed messages about whether this might be possible. Germany more optimistic, France less so. Ukip’s leader told MEPs he wasn’t hopeful. When it comes to renegotiation nothing substantial can be achieved because already all the big bosses in Europe have said that freedom of movement rules are not up for negotiation. THE SPEAKER: Will members wishing to take their seats, please, come to the table. Today, many Conservative MPs were being sworn in. The big question is what they might think of any EU reforms. Conservative sources say that a significant minority of Tory MPs would vote to leave the EU come what may, but most would probably follow the lead of the Prime Minister. The pro-EU lobby group, British Influence, tells me that the 70-odd new Tory MPs may sound eurosceptic, but most haven’t actually said how they would vote on this. Eurosceptics who want to get out though are optimistic. There’s very broad support for a very wide-ranging renegotiation, getting us back to the market and getting away from the political and judicial arrangements as currently constituted by the EU. In the end, much will depend on what concessions Europe’s leaders are willing to make. Ao years ago, Britain voted to stay in. Yes, even her. Now it’s time for the next generation to choose. james Landale, BBC News, Westminster. Police are continuing to question nine men arrested in connection with the Hatton Garden Safety Deposit raid. The men were detained yesterday during raids in London and Kent. The contents of 56 safety deposit boxes, worth millions of pounds in total, were stolen over the Easter weekend. Daniel Sandford reports. The huge police forensics operation went right through a second day while nine men, aged A3 to 76, were still in custody. This was Riverside Gardens in Enfield with police officers visible inside. The home of lI8-year-old plane enthusiast, Hugh Doyle, a plumber with an interest in yachting. Seen in this video, posted by his company on Facebook, he has a good reputation as a plumber, but is now being questioned about his alleged role in the Hatton Garden diamond heist. I can’t believe something like that, you know, because they seem such lovely people. In Dartford, to the east of London, forensic officers were pouring over new buildings at the back of a large house. This is the home of Brian Reader, the oldest of the men being held. He’s seen here in a picture from the 1980s. His son, also Brian Reader, is under arrest as well. The burglary of the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit was one of the most extraordinary heists of recent years. The thieves drilled through a thick concrete wall and emptied 56 boxes in a vault in the heart of London’s diamond district. Police say they found a large number of bags of what they called ""high value items"" during one the raids, which they say they are confident were some of the items stolen during the burglary that Easter Bank Holiday weekend. What’s not clear is what proportion of the missing items have been recovered. All the same, the diamond dealers of Hatton Garden are toasting the Flying Squad tonight. Delighted, shocked, surprised. We thought, at best, they would capture part of the gang, but certainly not recover any property. But despite the intense forensics work, continuing tonight across London, as yet nobody has been charged. There isjust one fly in the ointment for the die manned traders. Those who had insurance were hoping the companies would pay out soon. Now a large number of gems have been recovered and it will take a while to work out which belonged to home and the insurance companies won’t be paying out until that bit of work has been done. jane. Daniel thank you, Daniel Sandford. The Labour MP, Tristram Hunt, has decided not to stand for the leadership of the party. He says he will instead support Liz Kendall. Mr Hunt said the party’s election defeat has been ""devastating"", and attacked Ed Miliband’s leadership as ""timid."" He’s the latest to turn his back on Labour’s campaign strategy. In the first of a series looking behind the election result, our special correspondent, Lucy Manning, examines Labour’s loss. Ed Miliband has flown back from Ibiza, but it will take Labour much longer to return. The Edstone, a symbol of what its MPs are calling, the party’s greatest crisis. The man whose company carved it told the BBC it was foolish. History is written by the winners and the Labour Party, I think, will rue the day they ordered the headstone to be made. If you read what he’s written there closely, they’re all so vague, they’re not worth what they’re written on. So why didn’t Labour persuade him? I think the Conservatives generally are more pro-business and I was a little bit worried about some of Labour’s policies with regard to business. The leadership contenders don’t agree why the party lost, but come to Warrington South and they have an idea. Nick Bent fought and lost the seat, number 22 on Labour’s target list. People just didn’t trust us enough on the economy. Two, people didn’t believe that they’ll be better off under a Labour government rather than five more years of the Conservatives. Three, I’m afraid, Ed Miliband never came across to most undecided voters in Warrington South as a strong potential Prime Minister. But the man alongside Mr Miliband during the campaign thinks one thing got in the way of a Labour win. His former aide still insists Labour’s problem, not policies or leadership. The big change in Scotland. The big rise in nationalism was what really hurt us. They perhaps needed to do more on economic reassurance, but I think, in the end, it was what is a huge structural shift, a tidal wave in Scotland, which we got caught up in. And, a warning for this leadership battle about mistakes from the previous one. Perhaps, we could have been speaking more to the public during that leadership contest than had been. leadership contest than we had been. One of the problems we faced was allowing that narrative to develop, the narrative that we crashed the car. It was simply untrue, but we left it too long to challenge it. The brutal truth is that even if Labour had held on to all its Scottish seats, it still would have lost this election. In seats like here in Warrington South, Tories won more of the disappearing Liberal Democrat vote. In the battle of the Tories Labour marginals across the UK, Labour made a net gain ofjust two seats. With Ukip also eating into Labour’s vote across the country, Labour’s journey back to power will be a hard one. Lucy Manning, BBC News, Warrington. The South African athlete, Caster Semenya, has told the BBC that she was humiliated by the public questioning of her gender, following her victory at the 2009 World Championships. The 2lI-year-old said she might not have survived the controversy had it not been for the support of her family, but adds she has no fear about returning to the global spotlight. Our sports reporter, Ben Smith, has been to meet her. Standing tall in the South African sunshine, Caster Semenya, an athlete at peace, a woman rebuilding her life, moving on from the past. COMMENTATOR: Semenya is away and got the gold medal sewn up in the bag. Six years ago, she was a teenage World Champion. It was a title she was never able to celebrate. Within hours, her genderwas being questioned by millions. She was front page news, abandoned by her sport. Now, in a rare interview, she reflected onjust how difficult that time had been. Probably, if it wasn’t for my family, I don’t think I could have survived it. How hard was it? I mean, you say you couldn’t have survived it? To be honest, it was a joke for me. When I grew up, I grew up like that. After an 11-month suspension, Semenya was cleared to run as a woman and although the gender test results were never made public, it’s understood she was found to be intersex, having both male and female characteristics. These days she has a new hairstyle and a new coach. He explained her importance to South Africa. I think we need Caster badly. I think it’s important that we see her return now, if I could call it that, in the bigger picture and also in the long-term. I don’t think we must put so pressure on her that it’s all-or- nothing this year. It definitely isn’t. With the olympics on the horizon, Semenya is out to better the silver medal she won at London 2012 where many felt she held back, scared of the scrutiny that would have come with gold. How can you be scared? You want to be a winner. So I’m a dreamer. What I dream of is to become an Olympic Champion, World Champion, World Record holder. So I can’t stop running because of people. If you have a problem with it, you have to come straight to me and tell me. So I cannot stop because of people saying, ah, she looks like a man, this and that, you understand. So it’s their own problem, not mine. ",,
96,BBC1 London,19-may-2015,BBC News at One,13:00,40 mins,True,"# I want you with me... # Wherever you are, they know you’re there. This summer on BBC Sport. A very personal pilgrimage, as the Prince of Wales goes to Ireland 35 years after the murder of his great-Uncle Lord Mountbatten. A historic moment as Prince Charles becomes the first Royal to meet Sinn Fein’s Gerry Adams, both urging reconciliation. It’s important enough on its own but it’s important to bejudged on our contributions to the ongoing need to build reconciliation. We’ll be live in the Irish Republic with our Royal Correspondent. Also this lunchtime. The UK enters its first period of deflation in more than half a century; the Government says it’s only temporary. British people should enjoy the period of low energy and food prices, enjoy it while it lasts. Whenever going to bring inflation back to that 2% target. A Christian baker is found guilty of discrimination for refusing to bake a cake with a slogan supporting same-sex marriage. Tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians flee Ramadi as Islamic State consolidate their grip on the city. Shall I compare thee - the lIoO-year-old picture of Shakespeare that experts say was him. Rocket science; astronauts ask school children for help with a scientific experiment. We need to grow our own food in space. That is where you come in. Later on BBC London: Guilty of actual bodily harm - the policeman who knocked out the front teeth of a student protestor with his riot shield. Plus, the global bank which employs thousands and why it’s reviewing whether to stay based in London. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. It’s a moment that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. The moment the heir to the British throne whose favourite Uncle was murdered by the IRA is introduced to the President of Sinn Fein. Prince Charles is with Gerry Adams in Galway right now at the start of a four day visit which includes a trip to Mullaghmore in County Sligo where his Great Uncle, Lord Louis Mountbatten, was murdered in 1979. Three years ago the Queen shook hands with Martin McGuinness in Northern Ireland. Today’s meeting on the west coast of Ireland is another milestone in the peace process. Our Royal Correspondent Nicholas Witchell is in Galway. This is a visit he’s long wanted to make, not his first to the republic but his most significant. Charles felt the impact of Northern Ireland’s troubles very keenly. His colonel in Chief of the Parachute Regiment which suffered and caused casualties. But it was the murder by the IRA of his much-loved great uncle Lord Mountbatten, killed off the coast of county slow Gobi an IRA bomb aboard his boat that hit Charles the hardest. This was Charles speaking about the Mountbatten murder in a BBC documentary. The awful thing was, he’d been warned not to go to Ireland. He always thought everybody was very friendly. It was one of those desperate things. 36 years after the IRA’s murder of Lord Mountbatten, the man who’s directed the provisional Republican move. For decades, Gerry Adams, arrived at Galway university to meet Prince Charles. He explained why he’d sought the meeting. I’m very mindful just reflecting, as we come to meet Charles’s family and the Maxwell family, also because I’m from a small place in Belfast and people were killed in Ballymurphy, including a mother of eight. Tomorrow, Charles will visit the area and meet local people touched by the tragedy. He’ll gaze out at the ocean where his great uncle became a victim of the troubles. It will be a public commitment by Britain’s future King to peace and reconciliation in Ireland. We can speak now to Nick. Two aspects to this visit, as you say, one the historic nature in terms of the peace process, but then have very personal pilgrimage? That is right. Let me just explain what is happening first of all. Prince Charles arrived a little more than ten minutes ago. He’s now inside the university building, there are various displays, he will see the work of the university and then he will meet the political leaders here in the Republic of Ireland among whom will be Gerry Adams. I was struck how reflective Gerry Adams was. You heard him going into the meeting a few minutes ago wanting to reach out, recognising the hurt felt by the Royal Family, recognising also the hurt felt within his own, the Republican and nationalist community in Northern Ireland and indeed across the communities. It’s not without risk for Gerry Adams. And a moment of great symbolism, taking part forward the symbolism of the Queen’s first state visit to the republic four years ago when she bowed at the Republican monument and spoke at Dublin Castle, the first meeting she had with Martin McGuinness in Northern Ireland, the Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland three years ago. Now, the symbolism of this, the member of the Royal Family, Prince Charles, who perhaps most keenly felt the effects of the troubles, losing his reveered great uncle Lord Mountbatten and within 21+ hours of meeting the leader of the Republican movement in Ireland, Gerry Adams, then going to Mullochmore. He will go, a visit he’s long wanted to make, to see the place where Lord Mountbatten was killed. Thank you. The UK has entered its first period of deflation for some time. It fell to minus percent. It can lead to people delaying making purchase, as Andy Verity explains. Harold Macmillan was Prime Minister last time deflation was cut. This may be the first time in 55 years that the average price of all goods and services has fallen, but actually, if you strip out services, the price of goods has been falling for six months and the price of good has been falling for a year. Supermarket price wars have helped to slash the cost of food by 3% in the year to April, but the biggest factor was cheaper fuel driving down air and factor was cheaper fuel driving down airand seafares, air and seafares, flights were 5.3% cheaper. This strong combination of rising wages and falling prices is good news forefamilies and it shows the been fit of an economic plan that’s working. It’s not damaging deflation. Of course, we remain vigilant to risks that might arise, and we have a system well equipped to deal with them if they do. Have you noticed prices falling? Not really. They have steadied but haven’t noticed a fall. Yes, we are finding you are getting more value for money on the high street. Have you noticed prices falling? No. Both the Government and the Bank of England have been at pains to say this is temporary. If prices kept falling for years and wages followed them, that could drag the economy into a lasting slowdown, but so far, wages are going in the opposite direction. The British people should enjoy this period of very low energy prices, very low food prices, enjoy it while it lasts. We are going to bring inflation back to that 2% target to keep this economy well functioning and to keep the job market growing and also to bring income growth up. Inflation below 0 is way out of line with Mr Carney’s 2% target, but he’s expecting workers to continue demanding high wages, forcing companies to raise prices again. Strange that after finally getting rid of inflation, the hope now is thatit rid of inflation, the hope now is that it will soon come back. Andy is here with me now. Why is everyone hoping deflation is a short-term thing? It’s partly because the fear of a deflationary spiral there. You mentioned people putting off purchases in the expectation that prices will fall. The other thing about deflation that is potentially harmful is the effect it has on debt. We have big debts on a Government level and personal level and actually, inflation is quite good for your debts. People forget about this. But to illustrate the point. Think back to someone you knew who took out a mortgage of £5,000 in 1970, knew who took out a mortgage of £5,000 in 1970, the average house price at the time, it probably seemed like a huge debt. But you had wages growing by double digits. By 1980, that mortgage didn’t seem huge at all, the repayments were more manageable. If you don’t have inflation, that goes into reverse, your debts hang around, they don’t shrink and get harder and harder to service and that’s the risk if we have a lasting period of falling prices. Thank you very much. A court has ruled that a Christian baking company in Northern Ireland was guilty of discrimination after it refused to bake a cake with a slogan supporting same-sex marriage. Ashers Baking company said that being asked to make the cake went against their religious beliefs. But the man who brought the case, Gareth Lee, had argued that decision had made him feel unworthy and a lesser person. Let’s cross to Belfast and our Ireland correspondent, Chris Buckler. There is been a lot of public discussion about this case, heated discussion. Many of the arguments were played out in court today. Asher Baking Company have made clear they are a family-owned basis and they felt they had the right to turn down this order for the cake. Today, the Districtjudge was down this order for the cake. Today, the District judge was very clear. She said what they did was against the law and the man had been discriminated against on the grounds of his sexual orientation. What started as a request for a cake has ended up in a legal battle and a very public debate about when someone has the right to refuse service and what is discrimination. Asher’s Bakery in Belfast turned down an order to make a cake with this slogan because they said it conflicted with their owner’s beliefs. The court found Gareth Lee had been discriminated against by Asher’s Baking Company on the grounds of his sexual orientation. He was awarded £500 of damages, taken with the support of Northern Ireland’s equality commission. The cake and the money isn’t important, it’s whether someone like Gareth can walk into a shop, hotel or restaurant and wonder, can I be served because they may have a different religious opinion of me. The Christian Institute helped fund the McCarthy’s legal defence, they own the company and strongly felt their beliefs should have allowed them to turn down the order. The judgment hasn’t changed that view. Like so many others, we just want to live and work in accordance with our religious beliefs and we know we’ve done the right decision before God and we have no regrets about what we’ve done. What started as a private disagreement has become a public issue in Northern Ireland where same sex marriage is not legal, with Christian groups on one side. It’s not pro-Christian, it’s antigay... And gay rights campaigners on the other. It’s become a political battle with Northern Ireland’s biggest party backing Asher’s. It’s the equality commission that should apologise for using taxpayers’ money to drag this case through the court. Today’sjudgment will to drag this case through the court. Today’s judgment will not quell that wider debate about religious rights and when people need to be protected. The Democratic Unionist party have put forward proposals for a so-called conscience clause in Northern Ireland which would give organisations and people a chance to refuse goods or services if it conflicted with their religious beliefs. Outside court, they made clear they continued to push for that law and there may also be an appeal in this case. It’s clear this battle for rights is far from over. Victor Chua, the nurse convicted of murdering two of his patients at Stepping Hill hospital, has been jailed for a minimum of 35 years. The judge told him he had a committed a dreadful crime and now had to pay the price. Let’s speak to our correspondent, Ed Thomas, who was in court. Strong words from the judge, Ed? Yes, inside courtroom two, thejudge told Victorino Chua what he did was truly wicked, dangerous and devious. Chua in the summer of 2011 contaminated saline products with insulin, then sat back and did absolutely nothing as his patients suffered. He was convicted of murdering mother of two Tracey Arden, an 83-year-old widower Derek Weaver. He poisoned others. Seven patients had their charts altered by Chua and sitting in the dock, Chua showed absolutely no emotion as 25 life sentences were handed down. The judge said that he could be only considered for parole after serving 35 years in jail. considered for parole after serving 35 years injail. Many 35 years in jail. Many of the people who survived his poisoning, some of the family members of the people he killed were in the public gallery here to watch Chua as he was sentenced. As Chua was led away from the dock, you could hear crying in the public gallery and outside police say that Chua has not even shown a flicker of emotion or any reforce for what he did on the wards of Stepping Hill. I spoke to one family before, they described Chua simply as evil. Thank you very much. Thousands of Iraqi civilians are fleeing the Iraqi city of Ramadi as Islamic State fighters try to consolidate their hold there. The UN says 25,000 have escaped in the past few days, most heading east to Baghdad. Meanwhile, forces of the Shia militias which backs the government in Baghdad are said to be preparing to enter the city in an effort to win it back from Islamic State. Here’s our Middle East correspondent, jim Muir. Devastation in Ramadi before the militants moving. When the Iraqi army collapsed, the militants consolidated their grip. These people were fleeing for their lives, some lifted out by military helicopters. Around 25,000 civilians also fled in terror of Islamic State but also getting caught up in an counterattack. Theyjoined 130,000 cou nterattack. They joined 130,000 others counterattack. Theyjoined 130,000 others who were already flooding out in recent weeks causing an humanitarian crisis. That leaves the capital of Iraq’s biggest province virtually deserted, apart from the Islamic State fighters waiting to see who might challenge their latest gain. The most likely contenders are the Iranian backed Shia militia. They have been held back for fear of sectarian consequences if they are sent to Ramadi deep in the Sunni heartland. That doesn’t mean that over Isis will take Baghdad or control the country, and I still think over time Isis will be defeated but this is fairly bad news and sets back the clock on what we had hoped by now would be a counterattack against the taking of Mosul. That now seems to be even further in the future. Prince Charles has met the president of Sinn Fein, Gerry Adams, during an historic visit to the Irish Republic. And still to come - looking for a noteworthy successor to Adam Smith. Who will be the new face of the £20 note? In sport, jason Gillespie says he would take some persuading to become the England cricket coach and leave his dream job at Yorkshire. He may be the most famous playwright the world has ever known, but there is one great mystery surrounding William Shakespeare - just what did he look like? There are a number of portraits, like these, that claim to be of Shakespeare. But the magazine Country Life is publishing what it claims is an authentic picture of him as a young man. Nick Higham reports. He is handsome, bearded and wearing a laurel wreath, and it is claimed he is Shakespeare at the age of 33. The images on the front of this pioneering excite Kapadia of plants is crammed with the coded visual references that Elizabethans loved. Now one man says he has deciphered the code. A botanist and historian who designed this garden in London. He says he thinks others have solved the clues in the book before. On first page the first owner has written. This is almost as significant as discovering what the young Shakespeare would have looked like. It is no surprise Shakespeare knew about plants and flowers, they crop up in lots of his plays, but what is a surprise is how close he was to Lord Burleigh, the most powerful man in England at the time of Queen Elizabeth, it puts him right at the heart of Elizabethan power politics. But what do the experts think? The boss of the Royal Shakespeare Company is intrigued because the figure is holding a newly discovered flower which featured in his Venus and Adonis. I can see that Shakespeare sexy. He looks like a self-satisfied pork butcher! It is a very appealing image with a kind of dynamism to it but the idea you would have a right of being depicted from life, which is one of the claims being made, on the title page of the printed book in quite this way would be pretty much unprecedented and so it seems unlikely. Newly discovered portrait that might be Shakespeare are nothing new but this one may tell us more than most. At the moment, if you have a twenty pound note, this is the face you’ll see on the reverse side of it - the economist, Adam Smith. But the search has already begun to find out who will replace him. Members of the public are being asked to come up with the names of artists, as Emma Simpson reports. The £20 banknote. It is in need of a refresh so who is going to be the new historic character on the back? The Governor of the Bank of England came to London’s Victoria and Albert Museum to announce that this time the face would come from the world of visual arts and he wants the help of the public. These are their notes. They are in everybody’s wallet, everybody’s purse. The £20 note is the most commonly used note and we want to radically change the process by which the character on the notes is elected so we have chosen field. We have been given external advice on which field, the visual arts, and now we want to hear from the public who they want on notes. From film-makers and furniture designers to architects and painters, it is a rich heritage to celebrate. This is the first time that the public has been formally asked to choose the face of a British banknote, so whose names could be in the frame? There is Lucien Freud, the artist, Alfred Hitchcock from film, Alexander McQueen from the world of fashion, and Barbra Hepburn, the sculptor. There is a huge choice out there. I think Alfred Hitchcock because he is probably the most famous of all in the gilded age of the movie history. In my opinion why change something that doesn’t need changing? It is a lovely note but it needs Turner, definitely. The Governor has the final say on who is it will be rolling off these presses. You can expect them to see them in your wallet in around three years time. More now on our main story, the historic visit of Prince Charles to the Irish Republic, where he’s been meeting the president of Sinn Fein, Gerry Adams. Let’s return to our royal correspondent, Nick Witchell, who is in Galway. It will be a hugely symbolic moment when it happens. It is running behind schedule but the formal meeting hasn’t happened yet, but will happen shortly. At the moment Charles is outside the moment Charles is outside the University of Galway. Gerry Adams has come out and he is standing behind them. He has been peering over the top of these people at the Prince of Wales. The formal meeting will take place in doors with other party leaders from the Republic of Ireland and that is where Prince Charles will meet Gerry Adams. We don’t know what form that meeting will take, meeting will ta ke, if brush past, in other words a handshake and a perfunctory greeting, orsomething handshake and a perfunctory greeting, or something more substantive than that. Laurence house has said it was Gerry Adams who sought this meeting, Prince Charles agreed to it. He may have consulted his mother about it, he may also have consulted the Government because very much of this is done on the advice of the Government. Thank you. An engineer from the Royal Navy who criticised safety and security procedures on Britain’s Trident nuclear submarines has returned to the UK and handed himself in to police. Able Seaman William McNeilly went absent without leave after making the claims online. The Royal Navy has denied there are any safety issues with its submarines. President Obama has set himself a new challenge - communicating in 11+0 characters or less. He’sjoined Twitter, and already has more than one and a half million followers. There we go, that looks good. It is out there, baby, all the tweets. He describes himself as ""Dad, husband, and 1+1+th President of the United States"". His first tweet from account @POTUS - ""Hello, Twitter! It’s Barack. Really! Six years in, they’re finally giving me my own account."" The trial of the former News Of The World editor, Andy Coulson, has been played a recording of the evidence he gave during a trial at which he’s accused of lying. In 2010 he was a witness in the court case of the former MSP, Tommy Sheridan, who was accused of perjury. Let’s speak to our Scotland Correspondent, james Cook, who was in court this morning. What has the court been hearing? Here at the High Court in Edinburgh thejury of nine men Here at the High Court in Edinburgh the jury of nine men and six women listened to this recording of the evidence which Andy Coulson gave during the trial in 2010 for perjury of Tommy Sheridan. They heard Andy has been called phone hacking at the News of the World when he was editor there. He said on the tape he had not known who Glenn Mulcaire was and furthermore denied knowing about payments which had allegedly been made by the News of the World two corrupt police officers. The charge against Andy Coulson is that he was lying during that trial in 2010, it is a charge which Andy Coulson himself denies, and the trial at the High Court in Edinburgh is expected to last four weeks. Thank you. The payday lender Wonga is re-launching itself with a new TV advert today in an effort to improve its image. The company has come in for fierce criticism recently over the treatment of its customers and advertising campaigns which it’s claimed were run at times of day when more children would be watching, ads it later took off the air. Wonga said it wanted to show it was lending responsibly and putting customers first. Simon Gompertz reports. The original Wonga ads, axed last year because of the risk that they’d appeal to children who’d pester parents to borrow. What are you responsible for... And here is the replacement. Borrowers described as hard-working and responsible for something. I’m responsible for doing the school run twice daily. Along with Wonga, punished only months ago for irresponsible lending saying it’s now responsible too. Its plan is to branch out. The high interest payday loan business had a potential market of three million borrowers, adding new sorts of loans, Wonga plans to target 13 million who can’t borrow from a bank or on a credit card. I asked non-Wonga users if they were persuaded, given that payday lenders’ charges have been capped. Wonga’s APR down to a mere 1500%. There are lots of images that we are all everyday people. Do you trust that? Not at all. If this was the first time you ever came across the Wonga product, maybe you would see this as a way of getting some money, but knowing their past history, I don’t think it would change my opinion of it. This is the payday lenders fighting back. Wonga, like the rest of them, now banned from charging too much. So trying to appeal to a wider range of customers who need cash. Wonga will give borrowers three days’ grace if they miss a repayment and they’ll freeze interest after seven days. But is all this enough to rescue the brand? It’s going to be hard. There is a big trust issue to overcome. You don’t do that by simply having a new advert that says you will be responsible. You have to deliver over the course of the next few years and the media will be watching them like hawks. The new advert airs tonight after 9 on Channel 1+ and tomorrow at 7.1+5 on ITV, times when Wonga claims it can minimise the number of children watching. You’re watching the BBC News at One. Our top story today: Prince Charles is meeting the president of Sinn Fein, Gerry Adams, during an historic visit to the Irish Republic. In a moment we’ll have the weather, plus the news where you are, but first the sport. jason Gillespie says he is humble to be linked with a vacant coach role of England. He says he would take some persuading to swap Headingley for Lord’s and replace Peter Moores. England are preparing for the first test of the summer series against New Zealand and joe Wilson has been there. Lord’s, just checked, Kevin Pietersen is not here anywhere. Gary Ballance plays the role of light amongst the shade. It could almost be insulting for you GUYS It could almost be insulting for you guys that people are talking about 31+-year-old not in your team when you have been doing so well? That is how it is. I try not to worry about that and just concentrate on scoring runs. The Yorkshire influence on the team only grows, as well as Gary Ballance and joe Root, Adam lives will be opening the batting. The next step might well be for Yorkshire’s coach to join England, thatis Yorkshire’s coach to join England, that isjason Gillespie. Here is the latest from him. Very humbling, very flattering. The Yorkshire boys have been me enough grief about it which is quite funny, but I haven’t had any contact. Until that happens I can’t really say anything. Right now England must concentrate on New Zealand, and bad news for them is that Brendon McCullum has arrived safely. These early-season conditions suit New Zealand nicely. Trent Boult was steaming in at 15 Celsius this morning, with a hat to match the occasion. Raheem Sterling is expected to formally ask for a move away from Liverpool this week. It’s understood the England player has already told manager Brendan Rodgers he wants to leave, and he’s due to meet Rodgers and chief executive Ian Ayre on Friday. I’m joined now by our Sports News Reporter Ben Smith. What is the term as defiant in their position, they won’t sell Raheem Sterling, they see him as a player for the future at Anfield but it is a difficult situation. Manchester City are definitely interested, Arsenal are keen and there are a host of clubs in Europe so if Liverpool want to cling onto him they will face a real fight this summer. To rugby union, and England’s World Cup winning coach Sir Clive Woodward is a surprise inclusion on a shortlist to become the new coach of France. It’s believed he’s one of eight in the running to take up the post after the World Cup later this year. Woodward left hisjob as England head coach 11 years ago, but reportedly has a burning desire to return to coaching a test side. That is all the sport for now. The British astronaut Tim Peake has come up with a novel way of letting people here on Earth share in the adventure of space rockets. Well, when I say rocket, I’m actually talking about the leafy kind. He’s asked children to plant rocket seeds that have been in space to see how they grow compared to normal plants. It’s hoped that one day it could help space explorers to grow food on distant planets, as our science correspondent Pallab Ghosh now explains. The children at the Phoenix School in West London will soon be planting seeds that have been in outer space. They’ll be looking to see how they grow compared with normal seeds. The aim of the experiment is to find out whether one day astronauts are ever going to be able to grow food in space. Now, that’s going to be important if humans in the future are going to live and work on other worlds. I think it’s a very good idea to grow food on the moon because you can see the differences between food that we grow on Earth and see, like, how the outcomes are, like, of the fruits. If the world was to come to an end, and other planets we were living and we could plant plants on other worlds and grow crops, then it would be easier for human life to live on other planets. So, could space-grown rocket growjust as well as plants on the ground? The experiment will be run by the Royal Horticultural Society, who plan to distribute seeds to 10,000 schools. It gets the children thinking about, boy, you know, how important are plants to us and, if we were to leave this planet, what plants do we need to use? The Rocket Science project was launched by Britain’s astronaut Tim Peake. We need to make sure we can grow our own food in space. That’s where you come in. We’re sending some rocket seeds up to the International Space Station to stay on board for six months with me during the mission and then we’re going to send them back down to Earth and we need you to help our research by planting them and telling us your findings. We’re calling this special mission Rocket Science, and we can’t do it without you. Eating on the International Space Station is a little different. The food is freeze dried, bland and has a life of its own. So the plan is for astronauts to grow and eat their own food. So far, they’ve been able to grow seedlings but it has not been easy. There are already a few experiments that have been carried out on the International Space Station to grow food in order to be sure that we can send people away for long duration missions. We need to be able to make sure that we’ve got the right foods and that means a variety of different foods and rocket is just one of the possibilities. With so many children taking part, the results really will be useful to scientists, hoping to find new ways to grow the gardens we see on Earth on other worlds. Let’s catch up with the weather. The weather is calming down and warming UP weather is calming down and warming up as we move towards the weekend. There will be showers up and down the land. These are the showers and recent thunderstorms we have had, and they will continue through the afternoon with intense downpours, hail, lightning and thunder. Not gloomy everywhere though. There won’t be too many showers through central and eastern Scotland, but even here in the sunshine temperatures are struggling, feeling colder because of the breeze and because of those downpours that keep going through the evening rush hour. Through the night, slowly but surely, the showers fade, the winds for lighter and that allows it to turn a touch cold, probably colder than last night. Across northern England, parts of central and southern Scotland, easily a touch of frost. A cold but Sonny started tomorrow with a few showers over north-west England and Wales, they should fade. We shall see showers in the east of England in the afternoon. Foremost, tomorrow is a much drier and brighter day and it will be quite a bit warmer. That warm trend will continue through the rest of the, temperatures climbing, turning drier on Thursday and Friday. Not completely dry on Thursday, a weather front will bring rain into the north-west of Scotland but for many, a dry but for many it will be a lot drier with temperatures climbing further. We are talking about temperatures in the shade, we measure temperatures in the shade for consistency reasons. 18 Celsius will be about average for the time of year, but the sunshine is very strong at this time of year, we are only one months away from the longest day of the year when the sun is at its peak strength. High pressure is the dominant feature, there will be some showery rain around but for most at the moment the weekend looks OK. A reminder of ourtop the moment the weekend looks OK. A reminder of our top story: Prince Charles is about to meet the leader of Sinn Fein, Gerry Adams. That is all from us, now it is time for the news where you are. Welcome to BBC London news. I’m Alex Bushill. A Metropolitan Police Officer has been found guilty of actual bodily harm. PC Andrew Ott was on trial for knocking out a man’s tooth with his riot shield at a protest in Parliament Square against tuition fees in 2010. Ott and another two officers were cleared of perverting the course ofjustice. The former Olympics Minister, Tessa jowell, has today formally launched her bid to become London Mayor. She promised to make building more affordable homes her top priority. She’s just stood down as an MP but announced her intention to stand in her former constituency. From Brixton Tim Donovan reports. The organisers of a local soup kitchen, this was a launch designed to underline that she can reach all sections of the community. She’s just stood down as MP for the area covering Brixton, but that’s not where she wants all this to end. So my ambition, our ambition, is to make London greater still. To build one London where every Londoner has the opportunity and the security to succeed, where Londoners have a quality of life to rival anywhere in the world and where no-one gets left behind. As part of her one London mantra, she talked of giving birth to her daughter 30 years ago, of three other babies in the same hospital ward, one was being taken into care, one’s mother was homeless and one’s father had just lost hisjob. Not a week goes by that I don’t wonder how all those babies are faring as adults. Tessa jowell is best known for her role in London 2012, in Cabinet she helped persuade Tony Blair and Gordon Brown to back the original Olympic bid. But the former Labour Mayor who worked aloneside her then is backing someone else now, Sadiq Khan. What do you feel when you hear people like Ken Livingstone saying we need to go for the younger generation, if you like, that generation, a new generation? We’ll probably hear a bit of that and I think it’s a ridiculous argument and it wasn’t one I think deterred Ken when he was going to stand and he’s a bit older than me actually. She’d launch a new home for Londoners agency on the lines of Transport for London and she says she could build build 2,000 new homes a year on TfL land alone. More detailed policies will follow. An inquest into the death of a London student whose body was found on a German motorway in March 2003 has begun today after a lengthy campaign by his family. jeremiah Duggan from Golders Green had been studying at the British Institute and the Sorbonne in Paris. Shortly before his death, he called his mother and said he wished to be rescued from danger. At the time, German police had recorded his death as suicide. Flights have resumed after thousands of passengers have had their travel plans thrown into chaos when London City Airport closed this morning. An early morning inspection found problems with the surface of the runway but a spokesman denied suggestions there was a hole and apologised to passengers for the inconvenience caused. The runway has now been repaired but flights are still subject to delays and cancellations, with passengers advised to check with their airlines before travel. Now let’s take a look at the weather with Kate Kinsella. Good afternoon. We have seen plenty of sunshine this morning but things are changing. We are seeing the cloud arrive, the wind is picking up and one or two heavy showers are starting to arrive. Between those, we should still get some sunny spells. This is the progress of showers. We could get one or two heavy ones, maybe a rumble or two of thunder. They won’t last long and will blow through quickly on the breeze. It will feel cool with the breeze at around 15. Overnight, the showers will continue, at least for the evening. The second part of the night, they begin to die out and the wind starts to fall lighter as well. That is when the temperatures drop. A chilly second half of the night. Minimum temperature down to five or six in towns and cities, perhaps cooler in the countryside. A bright start tomorrow morning. Quite a nice start to the day. That sunshine is warming up a little further. The wind is a lot less tomorrow and that sunshine could spark off one or two showers tomorrow afternoon. Still the temperature rises slightly. 17, maybe 18 by the end of the day being the maximum. As we head through the rest of the week, it is looking a little more settled. We are going to have a chilly night on Wednesday. Temperatures could reach 19 or 20 on Thursday. Another clear night Thursday into Friday and we are looking at temperatures perhaps by the end of the week up to 21. That’s it from me. Alice Bhandhukravi will be here with our 6.30 programme.

Face to face - there’s a handshake, and there are smiles, on a visit to the Irish Republic. 35 years since his uncle was murdered by the IRA - Charles prepares to visit the site of Lord Mountbatten’s death. We’ll be looking at the significance of today’s meeting for Anglo-Irish reconciliation. Also on the programme.

Tonight on BBC London: The student protester assaulted by an officer- a Met policeman is found guilty of actual bodily harm. And the family of a soldier killed at Surrey’s Deepcut Barracks urge a coroner to allow her body to be exhumed. Good evening, and welcome to the BBC News at Six. Prince Charles has shaken hands with Gerry Adams. It’s the first meeting in the Irish Republic between a member of the Royal Family and a Sinn Fein representative - and it’s being hailed as a historic milestone in the process of reconciliation. Tomorrow, Prince Charles will visit the village of Mullaghmore, where his uncle, Lord Mountbatten, was murdered by the IRA in 1979. Our royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell is following the visit, and is in Galway tonight. The Royal Family as we know does not involve itself directly in politics, thatis involve itself directly in politics, that is the theory. There are occasions when its members can convey a similar blich which few politicians can muster. Ireland is one such case. I happened four years ago when the Queen went to Dublin. It has happened again here today. I should warn you there is some flash photography in this report. It was another of those moments where you have to pinch yourself. A handshake between Britain’s future king, and a man who, for so many years, was deeply committed to what Irish Republicans called the Armed Struggle. And it was more thanjust a handshake, because after the cameras withdrew, Gerry Adams and Sinn Fein’s Martin McGuinness had a 15 minute private meeting with Prince Charles. The purpose - to try to heal old wounds. Both he and we expressed our regret for what had happened from 1968 onwards. INAUDIBLE QUESTION. It’s not for me to speak about anything other than our side of the meeting, but we were of a common mind, and the fact that the meeting took place, that obviously was a big thing for him to do. It was also a big thing for us to do. For the Royal family, one death during the Troubles caused particular pain. Lord Mountbatten was part of the Royal Family, a cousin of the Queen. On the 27th of August 1979, he was killed by an IRA bomb placed on his boat off the County Sligo port of Mullaghmore. Prince Charles was deeply affected by the death of his revered great uncle. He spoke about it in a BBC documentary. The awful thing was he had been warned not to go to Ireland. But he always thought everybody around was very friendly. It was one of those desperate things. Prince Charles is to visit Lord Mountbatten’s home in Mullaghmore. He will be there tomorrow, and the townspeople will welcome him. I think it’s a kind of absolution for Mullaghmore. It’s as if Prince Charles is saying that he knows Mullaghmore was not involved, the people here were not involved, but I’m coming after this time to say to you, we are friends, we are neighbours. It’s four years now since the Queen made her ground-breaking first visit to the Irish Republic. She bowed her head at the memorial to those who fought for Ireland’s freedom. It was a visit which is said to have done much to lay the ghosts of the past. In Galway this afternoon, a handshake over a cup of tea. How very matter of fact it all looked. Yet it signified another moment of closure on the pain of Ireland’s past and represented a note of hope for the future. Nicholas Witchell, BBC News, Galway. Well it will be late tomorrow afternoon when Charles gets to mug more. He will attend a church service nearby and pray for peace. He will go to his uncle’s former home. Meet rescue we ares and walk by the harbour. 21+ hours after meeting Gerry Adams it will be a powerful message of reconciliation. Detectives hunting the gang behind the Hatton Garden jewellery raid have arrested seven men - two of them in their 70s. The contents of 56 safety deposit boxes, worth millions of pounds in total, were stolen during a well-planned raid over the Easter weekend. Our home affairs correspondent, Tom Symonds, has more. A hole in the wall. Millions of pounds worth of values gone, leaving dozens of worried owner, this morning the Flying Squad raided addresses in north London and Kent, include morgue than 20 officers at this house in Dartford. Neighbour’s reaction? Computer or and shock, really, because you know, from nothing, you have this sudden invasion of police officer, without knowing what it is all about. It was prearguing ranged, well planned operation. I am prearguing ranged, well planned operation. Iam pleased operation. I am pleased to say this morning, 12 addresses have been raided across London and Kent area. As a result of those raids I can turn round and say that seven white British males have been arrested. The investigation into who broke in to Hatton Garden’s safe deposit limited continues with the question of those arrested. They range in age from 1+8, to 76. But police are clear about how the burglars did it. They entered at street level, got into the lift shaft via the second floor and lowered themselves to the basement there, they prized over some shutters and ground through the half metre wall with an industrial strength drill as they spent the Easter weekend breaking open deposit boxes an alarm went off but police say proper processes weren’t followed. The only response was from a private security guard who saw nothing. A review has begun. Six weeks after the heist that resembled a movie plot police are satisfied. At tiles be from been portrayed as if we acted like key stone cop, I want to reassure you in the finest tradition of Scotland Yard these detectives have done their utmost to bring justice for the victims of the crime. Including the Met, belief, recovering some of the valuable so painstakingly stolen. Inflation has turned negative for the first time since 1960. Figures out today show it dipped to minus 0.1% in the year to April- mainly driven by lower oil costs and cheaper food. The Chancellor has denied this is the beginning of a period of dangerous deflation, calling it good news for family budgets. Here’s our economics editor Robert Peston. This skiffle classic was top of the charts in March 1960, the last time prices fell in Britain. And more than 70% of us weren’t even born. For most of the post-war year, inflation was the British disease, but today, the pressure on prices, especially for food, is downward. We see the forces in the market continuing to stay, and as such it will continue to be more and more competitive. Meaning that we will have to continue to offer great prices, every day. Here is the history of British prices. A little bit of deflation 55 years ago, then decades of inflation, which was rampant in the '70s, till today’s big chill. Price rises on ice, the advent of deflation, what is the risk of the economy catching a cold? Well, it could happen if we decided to defer our spend manager the home of picking up bargains later if employers decided to pay us less, the economy slowed down and our big debts became harder to service, right now, the danger of that looks reasonably slim. So these things are going a bit further than they did. On the day that the Bank of England asked all of us for or nominations forartist to be the face on the next issue of notes the Governor warn us not to assume falling prices are the new norm. We expect inflation to be low for the next several months but over the course of the year, as we get towards the end, inflation should start to pick up, towards our 2% target. The British people should enjoy this period of very low energy price, very low food prices, enjoy it while it lasts. Much of the initial spur to deflation came from a collapse in the oil and fuel price, which has been partially reversed in crept week, and another source of lower prices was fall in the price of imports from the eurozone. That came from a drop in the value of the euro, which also may have ended. Operation bargain hunters. General price falls, deflation, lastedjust three months, in 1960. And maybe even shorter lived today. A Ukip MEP who launched a personal attack on Nigel Farage in the aftermath of the election has stood down from his front bench role in the party. Patrick O’Flynn has resigned as economics spokesman and apologised to Mr Farage for calling him ""snarling, thin-skinned and aggressive"". Our political correspondent Alex Forsyth is in Strasbourg, where Ukip MEPs have been meeting. Patrick O’Flynn was a key ally of Nigel Farage and a big player in Ukip, both here at the European Parliament, and in the UK, and that is what made his comments of last week so surprising. He accused Nigel Farage of taking advice from inexperienced aides and becoming too aggressive, that caused a rift in the party and it led to questions over Nigel Farage’s leadership. But today Patrick O’Flynn has apologised for what he called unkind and unfair comments, and the Ukip leader Nigel Farage said that draws a line under the matter. It takes a big man to apologise. It takes a big man to say, I’m sorry, I got this wrong, I hold my hands up, I’m standing down from my position. But, as he says, he remains utterly loyal to me, to the party, and to the cause. We have a referendum coming up and, yes, we had a pressure-cooker environment in our London office during that election campaign and afterwards some unwise things were said by some people. Well Patrick O’Flynn remains a member of Ukip and he remains an MEP, but his apot Egyptians was humbling. We have spoken to other members of Ukip here today, who say they respect him for making it, and the relationship will mend. This has allowed Nigel Farage to assert his authority. For now the party hopes this will put an end to an unedifying matter. A nurse who murdered two patients at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport has beenjailed for life. Victorino Chua, who injected insulin into bags of saline which were then administered to patients, was told he will serve a minimum of 35 years. Ed Thomas has more. He add a guetty to care but Victorino Chua wanted to cause pain. Today, a judge told the Stepping Hill nurse he was a dangerous and devious man, who made his patients suffer. In the summer of 2011, Chua began a poisoning spree. He spiked saline bags and ampules with inlnce line. He kaled Tracey Arden. An 83-year-old widower Derek Weaver. Today his family were in court, to see Chua jailed I think he is so evil. So evil. Yes. Diabolical acts, enjoyed seeing people suffer. This CCTV showed is Chua inside Stepping Hill. The judge described him as cunning. A nurse who committed dreadful crime, in court he stared straight ahead as he received 25 life sentences. The judge looked directly atjeremy Clarkson -- The judge looked directly atjeremy Clarkson -- Victorino Chua and told him he was wicked. The judge said he poisoned saline bags at random and left his victims to fate. In the dock Chua showed no emotion as he was told he would serve a minimum of 35 years. No comment. Police said Chua took out his anger and frustration on the people he buzz meant to care for. This letter was found hidden in his home. In frustration on the people he buzz meant to care for. This letter was found hidden in his home. In it, he wrote ""I letter was found hidden in his home. Init, he wrote ""I am evil, at the same time angel. I am a nice person. But there is a devil in me. He has failed to show any form of motion during this process, and any form of remorse for what he has done. Chua will be in his 80s before he can be considered for parole. Our top story this evening: History is made, as Prince Charles meets the Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams. And still to come: ROCK MUSIC Could this punk band, living with disability, Later on BBC London: The former Olympics Minister now wanting to be the next Mayor of London - Tessa jowell throws her hat into the ring. And to thine own self be true - but is this drawing by a London botanist a true depiction of William Shakespeare? He’s golf’s world number one, and atjust 26, he’s at the peak of his powers. Rory Mcllroy lifted his latest trophy at the weekend, at the PGA Tour event in North Carolina, to bring his career total of tournament victories to 18. That includes four Major championships, which have helped push his total winnings to more than £36 million. Our Sports Editor Dan Roan has been talking to him about ambition, his private life, and the future of golf. He may have onlyjust turned 26, but Rory Mcllroy has won almost everything his sport has to offer. The Northern Irishman is the best golfer on the planet, and at the peak of his powers. And, fresh from his third tournament victory of the year, he told me what motivates him. I want to be the best of this generation. I want to win a lot of golf tournaments. Ifeel like I can win a lot more Majors. I haven’t put a number on it because I don’t want to put that burden on myself, but the motivation isjust being better than everyone else. McIlroy’s form is all the more extraordinary after a difficult 12 months. A very public break-up with fiance and tennis star Caroline Wozniacki, and then a costly legal battle with his former management company. But now, all that is behind him. Personally you are in a good place, or does that not really matter, is it irrelevant when it comes to how you play golf? No, I think it is relevant. If you are happy off the golf course, you will play better on it, so obviously, I’m playing well on it, so it must mean everything is going well off it as well. Tiger Woods, the man Rory has replaced as the face of the game, continues to recover from a public fall from grace. So what has Mcllroy learned from his friend about life in the limelight? I would never be able to do what golf what Tiger did. He was a phenomenon and brought so many more people into the game. It’s just about balancing life. I think he’s becoming better at that with kids, and he really takes being a father very seriously. He has got better at it, and that is something I will have to figure out in the next few years as well. McIlroy’s appeal has helped him become one of the highest-paid sportsmen in the world, but at a time when golf’s popularity is on decline, he insists the game that’s sometimes seen as old-fashioned must be seen to change. People don’t have five or six hours a day to go and play golf now. A shortened format, something that can get somebody out on the golf course for a couple of hours, even if it’s just playing nine holes, 12 holes, whatever it is, something that can get people out playing golf but it doesn’t feel like they are there all day. Those who run the sport could do worse than listen to a man who appears every bit the modern sporting superstar. And if McIlroy’s phenomenal form continues, he could dominate golf for years to come. A brief look at some of the day’s other other news stories: The jury in the perjury trial of Andy Coulson, the former editor of the News of the World, has heard a recording of evidence he gave during the trial of the former MSP Tommy Sheridan. Andy Coulson, whose case is being heard at Edinburgh High Court, is accused of lying during that trial, five years ago. He denies the charges. A Royal Navy submariner, who described the UK’s Trident nuclear submarines as ""a disaster waiting to happen"" has handed himself in to police. Able Seaman William McNeilly went on the run, after criticising safety and security procedures in a report published online. He was arrested after arriving at Edinburgh Airport last night. The high street retailer Next has been ordered to pay more than £22 million in tax. HMRC challenged Next Brand Ltd, which is part of the Next group, over its use of a tax avoidance structure known as a rate-booster. The group was found to have artificially moved money around so they could try and claim tax relief on overseas profits. A bakery which refused to make a cake iced with a slogan that promoted same sex marriage has been found guilty of discrimination. Ashers Baking Company, in Belfast, turned down the order because the owners said it went against their Christian faith. Our Ireland Correspondent Chris Buckler has more details. What started as a request for a cake has ended up in a legal battle and a very public debate about when someone has the right to refuse service and what is discrimination. Ashers Bakery in Belfast turned down an order to bake a cake with this slogan in support of gay marriage, because they said it conflicted with their owners’ Christian beliefs. Today, a court found that Gareth Lee had been discriminated against by Ashers Baking Company on the grounds of his sexual orientation. He was awarded £500 in damages in the case, which was taken with the support of Northern Ireland’s Equality Commission. Taking the money isn’t important. It’s whether or not somebody like Gareth can walk into a shop or hotel or restaurant, and wonder, can I be served here because they may have a different religious opinion than me. This is not about the cake. The Christian Institute helped fund Ashers’ legal defence. The family that owns the bakery insist that they were right to hold true to their beliefs despite the decision of the court. Like so many others, we just want to live and work in accordance with our religious beliefs. And we know we have done the right decision before God, and we have no regrets about what we have done. It is not pro-Christian, it is anti-gay. Gay-rights groups have been campaigning for same-sex marriage to be legalised in Northern Ireland, but this case has exposed a marked divide, and angered some Christians and Unionist politicians. It’s the Equality Commission that should apologise for using taxpayers’ money to drag this family through the courts. Thank you very much. Today’s judgement will not quell that wider debate about religious rights and when people deserve to be protected. The drink driving limit in England and Wales should be cut to match the one in Scotland. That’s the view of the Police Federation, representing officers south of the border. It’s pointing to a sharp fall in the number of drink driving prosecutions in Scotland, as our correspondent Robert Hall reports: The pubs in this pretty corner of South Hampshire attract locals and visitors alike. Everybody who comes here by car knows the drink-drive laws and many people will know somebody who ignores them. Now the Police Federation say more action is needed and the rest of the UK should seriously consider following Scotland’s example. The risks are crystal clear, but too many of us are still drinking and driving. Last year, pub goers in Hampshire watched Scotland take a more radical approach. I visited this blog to share today’s recommendations with a lunchtime clientele. The current drink-drive limit in England and Wales is 80 mg of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. Based on the Scottish experience, the Police Federation want that figure cut to 50 mg of alcohol, roughly half the present level. We are all different, but on average that means a man would be able to drink less than a pint of beer or large glass of wine . A woman, half a pint of beer or large glass of wine . A woman, halfa pint . A woman, half a pint of beer or a small glass of wine. The opinions are divided in the bar. It should be no alcohol if you are driving at all. I think it’s OK today, I think it works. If you reduce it any more, pubs in the countryside who are struggling might go out of business. The Police Federation have also expressed concern that the warnings are not getting through to female drinkers. just to play you this clip from somebody who has been an alcoholic and is now campaigns against drink-driving. This is something she suggests ought to happen. Advertising could play a big part in making women more aware of what they are doing when theyjust have those few drinks. It’s something we don’t really think about, we just take for granted. I know a lot of women who drink at home a lot. We say, get up in the morning, take the children to school and think nothing of it. Advertising has a limited effect I think. If we are to take more responsible to everybody has to be clear on what that responsibility is, so we should look to the government to know what we should and should not be drinking. Whatever the method is to tackle drink-driving, in the end, this is where the life and death decisions are made. They’re called PKN, they’re from Finland, and they’re hoping to become the first punk band to perform at the Eurovision Song Contest. The four members are already signed to a major record label, and all of them have learning disabilities. Our correspondent Nikki Fox has been to meet them. PUNK ROCK MUSIC. Finland have a history of unapologetically sending the more memorable acts to your revision. memorable acts to Eurovision. And PKN is no exception. You’re taking punk rock to Eurovision, it’s the first time, isn’t it? So how did the band come to represent their country? An overwhelming majority of the public here in Finland chose PKN and their song, Aina Mun Pitaa, with fans saying they have captured the true essence of punk. This 90 second head-banger is about having to do the things in life you might not enjoy. And this isn’t a gimmick. PKN are signed to a major record label. Are you proud of Finland for having chosen them? I’m really proud. It’s something that, more or less, will change the world. The band met at this centre for people with disabilities back in 2009. They are one of the workshop’s many success stories. While others have forged careers in the arts, PKN might be the first to have fans fly from Braziljust to meet them. But are there any who think they’re back story is stronger than their music? I think it’s a great punk band, even if they didn’t have learning disability. Everybody thinks they will only get votes because they are handicapped, not for music. The music, that’s the most important thing. Not that we are four mentally handicapped guys. That’s not important. We are four guys who love rock and roll. Yeah. Four guys who love punk rock. Forever. The boys are in Vienna rehearsing for tonight’s semifinal. And there is pressure. They have been tipped to win. If they make it to Saturday, nearly 200 million viewers will see just what those with learning disabilities can do. And the band, they certainly won’t mind the fame. Nikki Fox, BBC News, Helsinki. Good luck to them. Let’s take a look at the weather. Very dramatic skies across the UK today firing at a few thousand flashes of lightning across the country. And producing quite a bit of rain and hail as well as you can see from this shop from Durham earlier. The storm clouds have had a silver lining with sunshine following. After a cool and blustery start to the week the rest of the week will be drier and start to feel warmer. Still heavy showers around at the moment in the East especially. The gaps between the showers are getting bigger and that will continue overnight. Showers later will be mainly confined to Western Coast and hills. A cold night than last night. The haves temperatures of six or seven in the city, and in the countryside, just a few degrees above freezing, maybe even below. Chilly start to Wednesday, mostly warm and sunny. Morning showers in the south and east. Potentially a rumble of thunder but maybe not. A few showers in eastern areas later with dry and sunny weather later. See afternoon cloud, patchy rain in Northern Ireland and Scotland after the sun shine. It will certainly feel warmer. Warm again on Thursday where we have sunshine but more thick cloud across the West of Scotland bringing outbreaks of rain and the odd splash later in the day. A dry and find a foremost. Quite cloudy across western parts on Friday, the threat of light rain and drizzle around the hills and coasts. Some showers. Still sticking with eight largely dry story and that will be the case at the start of the bank holiday weekend. This weather front. Will it take little bit for some of you on Sunday. Certainly drier than the week so far. That’s all Tonight on BBC London News: The student protester assaulted by an officer- a Met policeman is found guilty of actual bodily harm. It is always stressful for police officers but it is never an excuse to assault anybody. Ajury heard a recording of his colleagues immediately after the incident- but cleared them of perverting the course ofjustice. Also tonight: A growth in the number of construction sites in the capital- so is this a vote of confidence for London’s economy? The family of a soldier killed at Surrey’s Deepcut Barracks urge a coroner to allow her body to be exhumed. And the battle over the fighting cocks - why animal rights activists want one of the oldest pubs in the country to change its name. If you think about cockfighting, it conjures up the idea of an incredibly cruel and violent sport that has been relegated to the pages of history for a very long time now. Good evening and welcome to the programme. I’m Alice Bhandhukravi. A Metropolitan Police officer has been found guilty of injuring a man with his riot shield - after he was taped on his own recording device threatening violence towards the crowds. PC Andrew Ott knocked the tooth out of 20-year-old William Horner at a student demonstration in Parliament Square in 2010. But a jury cleared PC Ott and two other colleagues of perverting the course ofjustice. Rebecca Williams reports. This was a moment William Horner had his tooth knocked out by a policeman’s riot shield, it was December 2010 and students were protesting in central London over tuition fees. Today, Andrew Ott has been found guilty of actual bodily harm but along with his two colleagues, he was cleared of making UP colleagues, he was cleared of making up a reason to arrest William Horner. It has been very difficult for William, Horner. It has been very difficult forWilliam, he for William, he was a student at the time, he faced the prospect of a criminal conviction which would have followed him around for the rest of his life. That they Andrew Ott wor recording equipment which picked up his comments after he assaulted William Horner. PC Calvin Lindsay responded, saying this... The audio recordings also heard Andrew Ott make several the rugged terry comments about the protesters, including, Iwant terry comments about the protesters, including, I want to kill this little lot but in court he put that down to bravado, frustration and banter. PC Lindsay and PC bands were cleared of perverting the course ofjustice and he insisted that they heard this didn’t say he was going to trash a church. -- didn’t say he was going to trash a church. -- insisted that they heard the student say. In response to the audio recording, Andrew Ott said he had seen major disorder and believed that William Horner should be arrested. All public order situations whether there is potentially trouble, intentionally air I possible in London or anywhere else, it is always stressful for police officers but it is not an excuse to assault anybody. Independent police and commission says all three officers will now face further action. Lots more to come, including... is this what Shakespeare really looked like? Why some believe a drawing by a London botanist is the true depiction of the playwright. ~ -- Independent Police Complaints Commission. Now, the number of cranes visible on London’s skyline is considered by some to indicate the strength of our economy. Well, today new figures suggest the capital is showing strong signs of economic growth, with office construction back to pre-recession levels for the first time. But there are warnings that small businesses are still being hit by rising rents and a lack of affordable space. As Marc Ashdown reports. City analysts often look to the skies for a sense of which way the economic winds are blowing, and right now appetite for construction in the city is stronger than ever. The London Office Crane Survey is a sort of barometer for London’s economy, its latest report shows that in the past six months 31 new office construction projects have got under way, that means currently 9.5 million square foot of office space is in the pipeline. That is up 21+ percent since November. This is a huge vote of confidence for London. London is seen as being a global city if not the global city and I think what this report shows is both the breadth of demand and development going on, but also that we are seeing new types of businesses, businesses already located in London but importantly businesses are choosing London to move their businesses to, to headquarter here.

Ajury heard a recording of his colleagues immediately after the incident- but cleared them of perverting the course ofjustice. Also tonight: A growth in the number of construction sites in the capital- so is this a vote of confidence for London’s economy? The family of a soldier killed at Surrey’s Deepcut Barracks urge a coroner to allow her body to be exhumed. And the battle over the fighting cocks - why animal rights activists want one of the oldest pubs in the country to change its name. If you think about cockfighting, it conjures up the idea of an incredibly cruel and violent sport that has been relegated to the pages of history for a very long time now. Good evening and welcome to the programme. I’m Alice Bhandhukravi. A Metropolitan Police officer has been found guilty of injuring a man with his riot shield - after he was taped on his own recording device threatening violence towards the crowds. PC Andrew Ott knocked the tooth out of 20-year-old William Horner at a student demonstration in Parliament Square in 2010. But a jury cleared PC Ott and two other colleagues of perverting the course ofjustice. Rebecca Williams reports. This was a moment William Horner had his tooth knocked out by a policeman’s riot shield, it was December 2010 and students were protesting in central London over tuition fees. Today, Andrew Ott has been found guilty of actual bodily harm but along with his two colleagues, he was cleared of making UP colleagues, he was cleared of making up a reason to arrest William Horner. It has been very difficult for William, Horner. It has been very difficult forWilliam, he for William, he was a student at the time, he faced the prospect of a criminal conviction which would have followed him around for the rest of his life. That they Andrew Ott wor recording equipment which picked up his comments after he assaulted William Horner. PC Calvin Lindsay responded, saying this... The audio recordings also heard Andrew Ott make several the rugged terry comments about the protesters, including, Iwant terry comments about the protesters, including, I want to kill this little lot but in court he put that down to bravado, frustration and banter. PC Lindsay and PC bands were cleared of perverting the course ofjustice and he insisted that they heard this didn’t say he was going to trash a church. -- didn’t say he was going to trash a church. -- insisted that they heard the student say. In response to the audio recording, Andrew Ott said he had seen major disorder and believed that William Horner should be arrested. All public order situations whether there is potentially trouble, intentionally air I possible in London or anywhere else, it is always stressful for police officers but it is not an excuse to assault anybody. Independent police and commission says all three officers will now face further action. Lots more to come, including... is this what Shakespeare really looked like? Why some believe a drawing by a London botanist is the true depiction of the playwright. ~ -- Independent Police Complaints Commission. Now, the number of cranes visible on London’s skyline is considered by some to indicate the strength of our economy. Well, today new figures suggest the capital is showing strong signs of economic growth, with office construction back to pre-recession levels for the first time. But there are warnings that small businesses are still being hit by rising rents and a lack of affordable space. As Marc Ashdown reports. City analysts often look to the skies for a sense of which way the economic winds are blowing, and right now appetite for construction in the city is stronger than ever. The London Office Crane Survey is a sort of barometer for London’s economy, its latest report shows that in the past six months 31 new office construction projects have got under way, that means currently 9.5 million square foot of office space is in the pipeline. That is up 24 percent since November. This is a huge vote of confidence for London. London is seen as being a global city if not the global city and I think what this report shows is both the breadth of demand and development going on, but also that we are seeing new types of businesses, businesses already located in London but importantly businesses are choosing London to move their businesses to, to headquarter here. So what is driving it? Another report today suggests foreign companies, for one, a record 270 set up or grew here last year, creating 5000 jobs, many in the tech sector. A decade ago, just 26 tech companies came to London, last year it attracted 108. Having a mayor pushing London’s global image is also seen as a big factor but there are warnings that for smaller businesses, there is still more demand than supply which pushes rents up. To some extent London has been the victim of its own success and real estate investment is obviously vital for the capital but it is also vital that we encourage smaller firms to be able to incubate and grow in affordable office space, so one of the things that the council and the GLA need to do is ensure that we have continually got a supply of that stuff as well as all of the shiny, expensive, high profile new buildings that clearly permeate the skyline.

Experts say we are back to prerecession levels but everyone is aware of the delicate balance to guard against another bust, now the boom is back. So a vote of confidence for London - but in the square mile there’s nervousness after one of the world’s biggest banks said it would review its future in the City of London. Deutsche Bank says it’s reviewing its UK operation in the event of an exit from Europe. Mark Boleat is Policy Chairman for the City of London. Deutsche Bank is a major employer - this must be a worry? What Deutsche Bank have done is absolutely correct, they must consider all possible eventualities, it is a small possibility that Britain might leave the European Union and like other big financial institutions and big companies generally they need to consider what would they do if that happens. It is a pretty normal precaution for big business to take. Is it inevitable that others will follow suit? ~ Iam sure I am sure that big institutions are reviewing everything, all of the time, they have got to look at what might happen, however small the possibility, and be prepared to take action. It does not mean that they believe that Britain will leave the EU, most city institutions believe that will not happen but they have to have plans in case of thing does happen, just in case Britain should vote to leave. What we are seeing is really not a very significant development, it is good common sense planning by a big institution. What do you think the repercussions will be for the City of London? We do not expect Britain to leave the European Union, the message from city institutions is very clear, that Britain needs to be in the European Union, to be fully engaged, to help the government developed a reform programme which will meet the EU work more effectively for everyone. -- which will make the EU. Are you at the City of London at least considering the consequences of leaving the EU? Asl As I said, at the moment we are concentrating on helping the government developed a reform programme so that Britain will not be a the EU. Clearly if that happened it would have consequences, those consequences need to be understood and they will influence the public debate on whether or not Britain should remain in the European Union. Thanks very much for talking to us. The apparent suicide of a London student on a German motorway is likely to have been ""setup"", an inquest has heard. jeremiah Duggan from Golders Green died twelve years ago. At the time, German police had recorded his death as suicide. But his family have fought for the case to be reopened. Today, Barnet Coroner’s Court heard from a forensic expert, who said the road traffic accident looked as if it had been constructed. Southern Railway has defended giving fines to passengers who were standing in first class in a crowded train headed into London Bridge from Surrey. The operator said it was up to ticket inspectors to decide whether to fine customers for standing in first class on busy trains. Southern has been heavily criticised recently over its poor punctuality, Latest figures show that one in five of the operated trains do not time in part due to works at London Bridge. London City Airport was closed for nearly SIX hours to carry out unexpected repairs to the runway. Thousands of passengers were left stranded after an early-morning inspection found an uneven surface. Around 50 flights had to be cancelled. Others were diverted Stansted and Southend. The family of a soldier who died at Deepcut Barracks in Surrey say they’re ""dismayed"" that a coroner has delayed the decision on whether to exhume her body. Private Cheryljames was found with a gunshot wound to her head nearly 20 years ago. Katharine Carpenter has more on this and joins me now. Katharine. Cheryljames wasjust 18 Cheryl james was just 18 when Cheryljames was just 18 when she died. Herappearance do Cheryljames was just 18 when she died. Her appearance do not feel they have got to the truth about what happened at Deepcut Barracks. She was one of four soldiers to die there during their initial training between 1995 and 2002. The Ministry of Defence has always claimed that they committed suicide but their families believe there is evidence to suggest otherwise. That has led to a long fight forjustice for her family, they want her body to be exhumed so there can be a French search for ballistic evidence. Cheryl died in November 1995. Her body was found on the outskirts of the barracks with a single gunshot to the head. Her lawyers believe she was the victim of bullying and sexual harassment, even violence before she died. The first inquest into Cheryl’s death was held a few weeks later behind closed doors - it took less than an hour, the coroner recorded an open verdict. Seven years later in April 2002, Surrey Police launched an investigation into all four soldiers’ deaths, an inquiry which subsequently came in for criticism. Then last year the original coroner’s verdict into Cheryljames’ death was quashed and a new inquest was ordered. That brings us to today, nearly two decades on, when the new coroner finally laid out the terms of his inquest. What will the coroner be looking at? Firstly, he delayed the decision on whether to examine her body, he says he wants to wait for a doctor ‘s report, that will be a huge blow to her family who feel that these proceedings have been held up for too long already. He did say he was going to look at what happened the night before Cheryl Biden and whether there was any third party involvement, what her state of mind was. -- involvement, what her state of mind was. -- the night before Cheryl james died. He said he was going to look at shortcomings that might have played a role, such as drugs and alcohol. Outside the Coroner’s Court the father of Cheryl said he was glad they’re finally seems to be some momentum. We are faced with a serious injustice here and I believe there is another three at Deepcut Barracks, they must all come to court. For me, it isjust Barracks, they must all come to court. For me, it is just closure, it is drawing a line underneath it, it is not waking up every day thinking about the injustice and how we are going to fight on. For now, his weight goes on, there will be another hearing in September and the inquest proper will not start until February next year. -- inquest proper will not start until February next year. -- his wait goes on. The former Olympics Minister, Tessa jowell, has today formally launched her bid to become London Mayor. She’s promised to make building more affordable homes a priority. Though she’s just stood down as an MP, she announced her intention to stand in her former constituency. Our Political Editor Tim Donovan reports from Brixton. CHEERING Endorsed by the organisers of a local soup kitchen, this was a launch designed to underline that she can reach all sections of the community. She hasjust stood down as MP for the area covering Brixton but that is not where she wants all this to end. So my ambition, our ambition, is to make London greater still. To build one London where every Londoner has the opportunity and the security to succeed. Where Londoners have a quality of life to rival anywhere in the world. And where no-one gets left behind. As part of her one London mantra, she talked of giving birth to her daughter 30 years ago, of the other babies in the same hospital ward one was being taken into care, one’s mother was homeless and one’s father had just lost hisjob. Not a week goes by that I don’t wonder how all those babies are faring as adults. Tessa jowell is best known for her role in London 2012, in cabinet she helped persuade Tony Blair and Gordon Brown to back the original Olympic bid, but the former Labour Mayor who worked alongside her then is backing someone else now, Sadiq Khan. What do you feel when you hear people like Ken Livingstone saying that we need to go for the younger generation, if you like, that generation or a new generation? We will probably hear quite a bit of that and I think it is a pretty ridiculous argument and it wasn’t an argument that deterred Ken when he was going to stand and he is a bit older than me actually. She says she would launch a new Home for Londoners agency on the lines of Transport for London and she says she could build 2000 new homes per year on TFL land alone. More detailed policy will follow. Still to come... How reference to ‘fighting cocks’ in a name of a historic pub has drawn criticism from animal rights campaigners. And from blue skies to angry skies, and back again today, but which will win for the bank holiday? I will have the forecast later. Talks to avert a national rail strike next Monday have been overshadowed by threats of legal action by Network Rail. The company has criticised the ballot held by one of the unions involved - calling it ‘absurd’. Our Transport Correspondent Tom Edwards is here. Tom. This doesn’t seem to bode well? It is not great, usually there is a lot of brinkmanship around these negotiations but the language today from Network Rail has been extremely direct, in a letter to the union they called details in a strike ballot genuine nonsense, heavily criticised in accurate spellings of job descriptions and said workplace is listed in this document is absurd which means it will be legally challenging, I spoke to the union, they are equally clear, they are saying rather than waste everyone’s time about complaining about spelling abilities, we would like Network Rail to devote a similar amount of time and concentration to resolving the dispute, so this legal row is all going on while the peace talks are also going on to try to resolve this dispute which could start on Monday. And what would the impact be if it goes ahead? You have to remember that London and the south-east would bear the brunt of these real strikes, the latest figures I havejust got of these real strikes, the latest figures I have just got from the Department for Transport show that 51+5,000 commuters come into London using the trains at rush hour, it is about 1 using the trains at rush hour, it is about1 million over the whole of the day, the next largest city for a real commuters is Birmingham, with 1+0,000, so that is one tenth of the number and there is bound to be severe disruption if this goes ahead. We shall see. Thank you very much. It claims to be Britain’s oldest pub. But Ye Olde Fighting Cocks has drawn criticism from animal rights campaigners. One group wants it to change its name, saying it lacks compassion for animals. Chris Rogers has more on this and joins us from the pub. Chris. It is ina It is in a slightly tongue in cheek letter sent by the animal rights group Mhairi Black to the landlord of this pub, there was a serious message requesting that the name of the pub, Ye Olde Fighting Cocks, is changed to Ye Olde Clever Cocks to try to promote a more positive image of an animal they say is sociable and intelligent and still subjected to factory farming and cockfighting abroad. Let me take you inside the country’s oldest pub where Saxons once drank in the eighth century, Oliver Cromwell once stayed here during the Civil War, cockfighting took place here until it was bad 150 years ago. I will speak to Christo, the landlord. They want you to go vegetarian on the menu. We were quite surprised to say the least. It is something we considered for about one second. Mhairi Black do some great work around antifur campaigning, -- great work around antifur campaigning, -- Peta do some great work. But we cannot change one of the oldest pubs in the country to suit their gains. Many thanks, a lot of the local than the tourists that come here from all over the world feel that the pub has been demonised by Peta. I put that to a spokesperson for Peta. It is certainly not our intention to demonise the pub, I think the pub is fantastic. It is the name that is not fantastic, if you think about cockfighting, it conjures up the idea of an incredibly cruel and violent sport that has been relegated to the pages of history for a very long time now. So there is an opportunity for us to think about chickens and reflect on the way that we treat them and what better way than to celebrate these wonderful birds with a name that is more in keeping with today’s cultural values? Well, it has closed the caused a buzz on social media, a lot of people debating whether the country’s oldest public to catch up with modern culture, other people saying that animal-rights groups are demonising this publ saying that animal-rights groups are demonising this pub I need to let it go. Some people feel they have a point, we always welcome your views and you can continue that conversation and debate on the BBC London Facebook page. And chicken will certainly stay on the menu here for some time, I can tell you that. Well, that’s a relief. Thank you very much. In football, Queens Park Rangers have appointed Chris Ramsey as their permanent manager on a three-year contract. Ramsey took over as caretaker boss in February after Harry Redknapp resigned and has been kept on by the club despite failing to prevent the team being relegated from the Premier League. He may be the most famous playwright the world has ever known but there is one great mystery surrounding William Shakespeare - just what did he look like? But the magazine Country Life is claiming this portrait drawn by a London botanist is the true depiction of the Bard BS B yoUI’Ig ITIBFI. Nick Higham reports. He is handsome, bearded, wearing a poet’s laurels on his brow and it is claimed he is Shakespeare at the age of 33. The image is on the front of this pioneering encyclopaedia of plants published in 1597, it is crammed with the coded visual references that Elizabethans loved. One man says he has deciphered it. He is a botanist and historian who designed this garden in London. He was writing a biography of the encyclopaedia’s authorjohn Gerard when the penny dropped that he had found an image of Shakespeare. It was three or four in the morning, it was a midsummer night, I felt, oh, damn, that has torn it. The Gerard thing had been coming along so beautifully, I found so much new material and the story was absolutely magnificent. And he was my star. And suddenly he was outshone. The encyclopedia was commissioned by Lord Burleigh, Mark Griffiths says this is him and that is almost as significant as discovering what the young Shakespeare may have looked like. It is no surprise that Shakespeare knew about plants and flowers, they crop up in lots of his plays. But what is a surprise, if this new research is correct, is how close he was to Lord Burleigh, the most powerful man in England at the time of Queen Elizabeth, her chief minister and spymaster. It puts him right at the heart of Elizabethan power politics. But what do the experts think? The boss at the Royal Shakespeare Company is intrigued because the figure is holding a newly discovered flower, a snake’s head fritillary which features in Shakespeare’s Venus and Adonis. I can see that Shakespeare may be holding a flower that represents his great poem, does it look like Shakespeare? He is looking, you know, he is quite sexy. That is nice. Because some of the other portraits of Shakespeare aren’t very sexy, he looks like a self-satisfied pork butcher, at the Holy Trinity Church. Newly discovered portraits that might be Shakespeare are nothing new. Here is one that caused a stir a few years ago. One academic is sceptical about this latest. It is a very appealing image. It has got a kind of dynamism to it. But the idea that you would have a writer being depicted from life, which is one of the claims that is being made, on the title page of a printed book in quite this way would be pretty much unprecedented. And so it seems to me unlikely. But if this really is Shakespeare, it may tell us new things about the Bard. It has been a disappointing day weather-wise. That is an ominous cloud. We saw a bit of that today, it gives you a warning before the rain comes but not much, I don’t know how you did with your shower dodging today but it was a little tricky in places once that Reid got going. This picture was taken across London today and the skies darkened from time to time, this is how the radar picture looked, we started off all right, we had some sunshine to begin this morning and sporadically through the afternoon also but it was not long before the radar started to look like a jackson Pollock painting. These yellow flashes showing the heaviest of the rain. We had some thunder and hail also. They were pretty sporadic. While that meant that most places got them, they did not hang around for too long. If you did not have much luck dodging the showers you might be pleased to hear you have got more tomorrow, there will be fewer showers and the winds will be lighter. Into this evening, we will continue seeing showers trickling through and in places there could still be some heavy rain, they will be fizzling out as we get towards midnight with much more clear sky and the wind dropping back so it will turn into quite a chilly night with lows of four or 5 degrees widely but that means... I would not rule out a frost and that is quite late in the season, gardeners, so a bit chilly to start with tomorrow morning and there may be one or two showers from the word gold really but they will be fewer, they will not be as heavy, you should be able to dodge them easier as we go through the afternoon, especially, and there will be sunny spells in between. Temperatures will get up to 17 degrees in central London and even 11+ or 15 degrees, recovering across the Home Counties as well. If you are heading off to the Chelsea flower show over the next few days, you might not have so much use of the umbrellas and wellies because it will be drying out, especially in Thursday and Friday and across the rest of London, this is the sort of whether we will be looking at, on Friday we did get a high of 21 degrees which will be very pleasant indeed, find conditions towards the end of the week and the winds will be lighter as well. As for the bank holiday weekend, I can’t promise it will be absolutely perfect but this is the first sign of things to come, dry weather predominately, some spells of cloud, nothing too much to worry about. I shall not complain. Thanks very much, windy. -- windy. Now the main headlines... Canl Can I urge victims to stay patient, police officers will be in contact with them in order that we can restore this property back to their rightful owners. The Prince of Wales has shaken hands with Gerry Adams in the first meeting between a member of the Royal Family and Sinn Fein in the Irish Republic. The UK economy has entered a period of deflation for the first time since 1960. Last month prices fell to minus 0.1 per cent in the year to April. The Chancellor says the fall is good news for families. A Met Police officer has been found guilty of injuring a man by knocking out his tooth with a riot shield. But PC Andrew Ott and two colleagues were cleared of trying to pervert the course ofjustice. And new figures suggest building activity in London is back to pre-recession levels. Although there are concerns that small firms continue to face a lack of affordable space. That’s it. I’ll be back later during the ten o’clock news, but for now from everyone on the team, have a lovely evening. Goodbye. Hello and welcome to the One Show with Matt Baker. with Matt Ba ker. And with Matt Baker. And Alexjones. We’re celebrating two birthdays tonight, from two extremes on the musical spectrum. At one end the high camp glitter-fest that is the Eurovision Song Contest is 60! We will be finding out who will be turning heads later this year. Have you got that dress, the moustache is not in the right place, try it again. Have you still got the dress? I auctioned it for charity. LAUGHTER And at the other end, and twice as old, this year is the Proms 120th birthday. Please welcome, live in Vienna. There she is. Lifelong Eurovision obsessive, Mel. It is good to see you. Live in the studio, the Proms Queen, Katie Derham. APPLAUSE I will have a quick word with Mel, stand-by, because we will be coming to you in Vienna shortly. DRAMATIC MUSIC LAUGHTER Amazing. Katie, as you can see, we have Henry Wood with this. The founder of the Proms, 120 years ago, he is normally at the Royal Academy of music. We stole him, no, we haven’t. He is here to make sure you get your facts right as far as the Proms are concerned. No pressure. Interesting to see if he will turn in his because you are having a Ibiza-themed club nights thing? We have different collaborations every year, this year we are teaming up with every radio network that the BBC has. One of them is BBC One. Celebrating 20 years of electronic dance music, with an orchestra. Different sorts of musical worlds colliding which is what the Proms is good at. I am sensing a smile from Henry Wood. It is a wry smile. Don’t take this the wrong way. Do you use mouthwash after brushing your teeth? I have to be prepared for anything on the One Show but yes of course. Well, we might be able to save you a few quid there - here’s our consumer champion, Dom Littlewood on why you don’t need to buy expensive mouthwash to keep your pearly whites, pearly white. Call me old-fashioned but they used to be a time when cleaning your teeth meantjust that. Nowadays it is all about maintaining your all hygiene. Brushing is no longer enough, and us Brits shell out a whopping £200 million every year on this stuff, mouthwash. What I want to know is, do they really keep our teeth any cleaner than a good old-fashioned toothbrush? We’re testing three from the UK’s biggest selling brands. We are testing them against a trio of cheap alternatives from the UK’s top supermarkets. I have come to the School of dental sciences in Newcastle University. We have enlisted the help of these university students. Hello. They have agreed not to brush their teeth for three days. It does sound disgusting, but they are students after all! disgusting, but they are students afterall! Instead after all! Instead they will use mouthwash twice a day. First, the amount of bacteria or their plaque on their pearly whites is measured so we can record how the mouthwash is performing. Our students teeth have less than 20% plaque, which is pretty normal. But why is it such a problem? Dental plaque is a cause of dental diseases, decay, or will disease, implant problems. Time to get testing. jamie David Anthony Deane ditched their toothbrushes in favour of the market leading mouthwashes. Each with a recommended retail price of between £3 and £5. While three others are using the supermarket own brands, costing less than £1. As they are almost ten times cheaper, do they really have the same plaque busting power? I have come to the laboratory to brush UP have come to the laboratory to brush up on the science. You have a set of the same mouthwashes that the students are trying out, how will you test them? We grow dental plaque in a lab. We stain it with a special stain. It goes red if the plaque has been killed, red is dead. Or it stays green if it is still alive. So, let’s see how our mouthwashes have performed in the laboratory. There is no clear winner, they will all control plaque, they have similar ingredients. Where they differ is that some of the more expensive mouthwashes will have new things designed to try to do a little bit more than controlling plaque. Controlling bad breath, stopping the white deposits building UP stopping the white deposits building up on your teeth which will not be in the cheaper mouthwash. All six ",,
100,BBC1 London,19-may-2015,BBC News at Ten,22:00,25 mins,True,"History is made, as Prince Charles meets the Sinn Fein President, Gerry Adams. Face to face - the heir to the British throne and one of the most prominent Irish Republicans shook hands and held private talks. It’s the first meeting between a member of the Royal Family and Sinn Fein in the Irish Republic. The fact that the meeting took place - it obviously was a big thing for him to do and it was also a big thing for us to do. We’ll be asking what this means for Anglo-Irish reconciliation. Also tonight: Police investigating the Hatton Gardenjewellery raid arrest nine men - two of them in their 70s. Prices fall for the first time in 50 years, but the Bank of England Governor says don’t worry about deflation. Enjoy it while it lasts. We are going to bring inflation back to that 2% target to keep this economy well-functioning. Ukraine’s President tells the BBC his country doesn’t have the military strength to win its fight with Russia. And golf’s world number one, Rory Mcllroy, on ambition, his private life, and the future of his sport. Later on BBC London: The student protester assaulted by an officer- a Met policeman is convicted. And a vote of confidence in London’s economy as building activity shows a sharp rise. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Ten. Prince Charles has shaken hands with Gerry Adams. It’s the first meeting in the Irish Republic between a member of the Royal Family and a Sinn Fein representative - and it’s being hailed as a historic milestone in the process of reconciliation. Tomorrow Prince Charles will visit the village of Mullaghmore where his great uncle, Lord Mountbatten, was murdered by the IRA in 1979. Our Royal correspondent, Nicholas Witchell, is following the visit- his report from Galway contains flash photography. A familiar face in the crowd, looking on as he prepared for a most unfamiliar meeting. Gerry Adams seemed curious. For many years, the man he was observing represented everything he hated. And then they were together, shaking each other by the hand, Britain’s future King and an Irish Republican who believed for so long in the armed struggle - and it was more than a handshake. Because after the cameras withdrew, Gerry Adams and Sinn Fein’s Martin McGuinness had a 15-minute private meeting with Prince Charles. Both he and we expressed our regret for what had happened from 1968 onwards. REPORTER: Can you express... It is not for me to speak about anything other than our side of the meeting, but we were of a common mind and the fact that the meeting took place, it obviously was a big thing for him to do, it was also a big thing for us to do. Charles’ officials said nothing to say about the meeting with the Sinn Fein Leaders. He went off to visit the Burren National Park. He spoke of his fondness for Ireland. I have been so overwhelmed and so deeply touched by the extraordinary kindness, the welcome, the enthusiasm, indeed the fun of being in Ireland. 36 years ago, of course, it was a very different story. Charles was deeply affected by the murder of his much-loved great uncle Lord Mountbatten. He was killed by an IRA bomb placed on his boat in the harbour at Mullaghmore in County Sligo. Charles is to visit Lord Mountbatten’s home in Mullaghmore, he’ll be there tomorrow, and the townspeople will welcome him. It’s a kind of absolution for Mullaghmore. It’s as if Prince Charles is saying I know that Mullaghmore was not involved, the people of Mullaghmore were not involved but I’m coming after this time to say to you we are friends, we are neighbours. It’s four years now since the Queen made her ground-breaking first visit to the Irish Republic. It was a visit that is said to have done much to lay the ghosts of the past. In Galway this afternoon, there was a handshake over a cup of tea, how matter-of-fact it all seemed. Yet it signified another moment of closure in the pain of Ireland’s past. Ireland is one issue where the Royal Family has brought a powerful symbolism to bear in recent years. The Queen in Dublin and now Prince Charles meeting Gerry Adams and travelling to Mullaghmore. Nicholas Witchell, BBC News, in Galway. Our Ireland correspondent, Chris Buckler, is in Belfast for us now. Chris, how significant was this handshake? ~ I think it is significant, jane. The peace process is exactly that, it’s a process. You don’t bridge divides in one step, it takes time, it takes a lot of work. Sometimes big gestures really do matter. Moments that don’t just symbolise gestures really do matter. Moments that don’tjust symbolise progress, but actually show it. I think both the Prince of Wales and the President of Sinn Fein, despite their different backgrounds, they understand that. For Charles, this visit to Ireland is going to bring back some painful memories, a time whenever it was hurt and not handshakes that made the headlines. He knows dissident republicans still pose a threat and a lot of work is needed to be done to ensure the peace process is cemented. As far as Gerry Adams, he was, during the worst years of the Troubles, the face of Republicanism, but times have changed. His party has a political presence in Belfast, Dublin and London, even if they don’t take their seats in Westminster. It is worth noting that Mr Adams requested this meeting with the Prince. There will be some that suggest that it doesn’t hurt him to look like a statesman ahead of a crucial election in the months ahead. However, there were some sincere words and actions today. None the less, there will be Republicans and Royalists who feel very strongly they are angered by the images they saw today. I spoke to some Republicans who felt that way today. It is worth taking a step back and remembering and reflecting on how much change has taken place to allow this meeting, this coming together today. Detectives investigating the Hatton Garden jewellery raid have arrested nine men - two of them in their 70s. The contents of 56 safety deposit boxes, worth millions of pounds in total, were stolen during a well planned raid over the Easter weekend. Our home affairs correspondent, Tom Symonds, is in Hatton Garden for us now. Tom. Yes, this was an audacious and almost old-fashioned sort of crime here in London’s diamond district. It put police under considerable pressure, not least because of their failure to respond when an alarm went off here during the burglary. So, senior officers seemed relieved today to announce that the Flying Squad had moved in to addresses in North London and in Kent. A hole in the wall. Millions of pounds worth of valuables gone, leaving dozens of worried owners. But this morning, 12 addresses were raided, including this one filmed by a passing bus passenger. The neighbour’s reaction? Terror and shock, really. From nothing, you had this sudden invasion of police officers. It was a pre-arranged, well-planned operation. I can turn round and say that seven white British males have been arrested. Two more men were arrested later. The suspects are mostly middle-aged but three are pensioners. One is 76. Police still have to prove who did this, but they have a clear idea of how it was done. They entered at street level, got into the lift shaft via the second-floor and lowered themselves to the basement. There, they prised open some shutters and ground through the half-metre vault wall with an industrial-strength drill. As they spent the Easter weekend breaking open deposit boxes, an alarm went off. Police said today proper processes weren’t followed. The only response was from a private security guard who saw nothing, a review has begun. Six weeks after the heist that resembled a movie plot, police are satisfied. At times, we have been portrayed as if we have acted like Keystone Cops. I want to reassure you that in the finest traditions of Scotland Yard, these detectives have done their utmost to bring justice for the victims of this callous crime. Including the Met believes recovering some of the valuables so painstakingly stolen. Tom Symonds, BBC News. Prices have fallen for the first time in more than 50 years. Figures out today show the Consumer Prices Index dipped to minus 0.1% in the year to April. The Chancellor has denied this is the beginning of a period of ""dangerous deflation"", calling it good news for family budgets. Here’s our Economics Editor, Robert Peston. # Oh my old man’s a dustman, he wears a dustman’s hat... # This skiffle classic was top of the charts in March 1960, the last time prices fell in Britain and more than 70% of us weren’t even born. For most of the post-war years, inflation was the British disease, but today the pressure on prices, especially for food, is downward. We see the forces in the market continuing to stay and, as such, it will continue to be more and more competitive meaning that we will have to continue to offer great prices every day. So, going to the supermarket is no longer as painful as being hit around the head with a dead fish! And here is the history of British prices. A little bit of deflation 55 years ago, then decades of inflation, which was rampant in the 1970s, until today’s big chill. Price rises on ice, the advent of deflation, what’s the risk of the economy catching a cold? Well, it could happen if we decided to defer our spending in the hope of picking up bargains later, if our employers decided to pay us less, the economy slowed down and our big debts became harder to service, but right now, the danger of that looks reasonably slim. So, these things are going a bit further than they did and, on the day the Bank of England asked all of us for our nominations for an artist to be the face on the next issue of notes, the Governor warned us not to assume falling prices are the new norm. To be clear, we expect inflation to be very low for the next several months, but, over the course of the year, as we get towards the end, inflation should start to pick up towards our 2% target. The British people should enjoy this period of very low energy prices, very low food prices, and enjoy it while it lasts. Much of the initial spur to deflation came from a collapse in the oil and fuel price, which has been partially reversed in recent weeks. And another source of lower prices was a fall in the price of imports from the eurozone. That came from a drop in the value of the euro, which also may have ended. NEWSREEL: Operation bargain-hunters... General price falls - deflation - lasted just three months, in 1960. And may be even shorter lived today. Robert Peston, BBC News. The conflict in Ukraine can’t be won militarily, according to the country’s President. In an exclusive interview with the BBC, Petro Poroshenko says he will need to negotiate with Russia’s President Putin in order to find a resolution. More than 6,000 people have been killed since the crisis began more than a year ago. Moscow denies that any of its soldiers are taking part in the fighting, between Kiev’s government troops and pro-Russia rebels. But as Fergal Keane now reports, Ukraine is preparing itself for a summer offensive. The country is defined by the suffering of war. Lives destroyed and a national territory lost. The man the West hopes will lead Ukraine out of disaster is President Petro Poroshenko, but he told me this summer could bring an upsurge in violence. Do you think another offensive is coming? Ido not hear anything. I think that we should be ready for the offensive. We do not give them any tiny chance for provocation. Do you trust Vladimir Putin? Trust? Do you trust him? No. No. How do you negotiate with someone you don’t trust? ~ I don’t have any option. I don’t think that the results or the reason of my territory would be happy about military means. You’re not going to get it back? No. Before interviewing the president, Iwent get it back? No. Before interviewing the president, I went to meet some ordinary Ukrainians affected by the conflict. At this former collective farm, I spoke to a woman whose son was drafted into the army and killed last january. TRANSLATION: We, the poor, have to go and fight and what are the rich doing? Even our leadership especially the ones who sit-in Parliament, I don’t think they really care about us. They don’t live like us with their cars and apartments and mansions. What do you say to somebody like that? This is a disaster. A disaster not only for the mother. A disasterfor the disaster. A disaster not only for the mother. A disaster for the whole country. A disaster for every family who lost 1800 soldiers. For every family who lost almost 7,000 civilians and this is not about the relationship between the poor and the oligarch. This is the result of the aggression. Aggression against mY the aggression. Aggression against my country. The protests which brought the president to power were a cry of rage against corruption. Scores of protesters were killed. But a year on, with the economy on the verge of bankruptcy, there is deep disillusionment. This man was wounded by a sniper while protesting for freedom. wounded by a sniper while protesting forfreedom. Have for freedom. Have you achieved that freedom, do you believe? No. Why? There are new faces in our Government, but I think nothing has changed. The corruption is so deep, it is such a mess. It is at the core of things? I try to be as transparent as possible because I urgently need the trust for the investor, the trust for the panners that we can fight not on the war on the east, but one of the most important war ins my country, the war against corruption. When you have finished your term, what do you hope you will have achieved? I really dream that I will be a member of the European Parliament and Ukraine would be a member of the European Union and I will do my best. The president offers the appearance of calm, but the forces ranged against him at home and abroad offer little certainty for his plans or future. A court has ruled that a bakery in Northern Ireland unlawfully discriminated against one of its customers, after it refused to make a cake with a slogan supporting same-sex marriage. Ashers Baking Company said the message went against their Christian beliefs. Andy Martin reports. What started as a request for a cake has ended up in a legal battle and a very public debate about when someone has the right to refuse service and when refusal becomes discrimination. Ashers bakery in Belfast turned down an order to bake a cake with this slogan in support of gay marriage because they said it conflicted with their owner’s Christian beliefs. Today a court found that Gareth Lee had been discriminated against by Ashers Baking Company on the grounds of his sexual orientation. He was awarded £500 in damages in a case that was taken with the support of Northern Ireland’s Equality Commission. The cake and the money isn’t important. It is whether or not someone like Gareth can walk into a shop or a hotel or a restaurant and wonder, ""Can I be served here because they may have a different religious opinion than me?""' It is not about the cake. The family bakers at the centre of this case may not be the last to come before the courts. Like so many others, we just want to live and work in accordance with our religious beliefs and we know we’ve done the right decision before God and we have no regrets about what we’ve done. Gay rights groups have been campaigning for same-sex marriage to be legalised in Northern Ireland, but this case has exposed a marked divide and angered Christians and Unionist politicians. As a result of what happened here, Northern Ireland’s largest political party wants to introduce a conscience clause into law which would allow people of faith to refuse business on moral grounds. This is an attack and an assault on people’s deeply held, sincere convictions. Ajudge recognised A judge recognised this family had sincerely held religious beliefs. This case has focussed a debate on just where the line lies between protecting the right to hold religious objections and the requirement in law to protect the individual. A nurse who murdered two of his patients at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport has beenjailed for life. Victorino Chua injected insulin into bags of saline that were later unwittingly used by other nurses. 20 other patients were poisoned. The judge at Manchester Crown Court said he will serve a minimum of 35 years. A Ukip MEP who launched a personal attack on Nigel Farage has stood down from his front bench role in the party. Patrick O’Flynn has resigned as economics spokesman and apologised to Mr Farage for calling him ""snarling, thin-skinned and aggressive"". Alex Forsyth reports from Strasbourg. They worked side by side at the heart of Ukip, but last week this key ally turned on Nigel Farage. Patrick O’Flynn said the Ukip leader ran a snarling and aggressive election campaign, but today he apologised for his unhelpful, unfair and unkind remarks stepping down from Ukip’s frontbench and expressing sincere regret at going public with his frustrations. Nigel Farage in Strasbourg today welcomed the apology for criticism which had prompted some to question his leadership. It takes a big man to apologise. It takes a big man to say, ""Look, I’m sorry. I got this wrong. I hold my hands up. I’m standing down from my But he remains utterly loyal to me, to the party, to the cause. We’ve got a referendum coming up and yes, we had a pressure cooker environment in our London office during the election campaign and afterwards, some unwise things were said by some people. That’s over now. In Westminster yesterday, the Ukip leader was determined to draw a line under recent infighting appearing alongside his only MP and together rebutting rumours of recent conflict. I’m delighted to be supporting, standing shoulder-to-shoulder next to Nigel. Well, not quite. I’m not tall enough. Also there was Ukip’s deputy chairman. In Strasbourg today the party’s MEPs were keen to focus on policy, not party politics. Are you all unified behind Nigel Farage now? Oh absolutely. We’re just waiting for the next battle. We know the next battle will be the referendum campaign. Accepting this apology has allowed Nigel Farage to assert his authority as Ukip’s leader. He sees the party as having a crucial role in the debate over Britain’s future in Europe and wants to be at the helm. But despite the public show of unity, some suggest privately there is still some division within the party. With the key battle over Europe looming, Nigel Farage needs party cohesion and discipline. As he prepares to reshuffle Ukip’s top team, he claims to have total support. The test will be whether he can keep it. The Europe Minister has indicated that a referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU could come sooner than the deadline of 2017. David Liddington also said he’s optimistic that Britain can achieve reform of the EU. One of the key players in that debate is Germany whose Chancellor Angela Merkel has been hosting her French counterpart in Berlin today, for wide-ranging talks. Katya Adler is in Berlin tonight. Well, Germany and France side by side have always run the EU show and there was another demonstration of that unity today, but nobody wants the UK to leave. David Cameron will find that Germany in particular, although there will be limits, is ready to hear what he wants. Welcome to the British-German yacht club in the leafy outskirts of Berlin. A positive nostalgic leftover from Britain’s post-war presence here. Most of the hobby sailors are German. Keen enthusiasts, notjust of British culinary culture, but of Britain itself as many Germans are. Like Angela Merkel. The EU’s most powerful leader, not a bad friend for the UK to have. She held a press conference today with the French President. They discussed Europe’s most pressing issues, she said. Including the UK, post election meaning Britain’s desire to reform the EU and to hold a referendum. It’s a necessary partner. For me, it is not imaginable that Britain is going to leave the EU. How much will Angela Merkel give to keep David Cameron and the UK in? Well, it’s part of any negotiation. I will not give you the answer in public at the moment. No red lines? Well, certain red lines we are not cross. But flexibility? We have the utmost flexibility to keep the UK in the EU. There are very practical reasons why Germany wants to keep Britain in. German businesses like the UK’s free-market, free trade, anti red tape push, a counterweight against the EU’s more protectionist, interventionist countries, but there are fundamental differences too. Most Britons tend to see the EU as an economic issue whereas here and in France for example, it is political. Viewed through the prism of history and seeped in a deep desire for cross-border peace. Many Germans feel the UK doesn’t appreciate that. They resent more calls for EU reform and Angela Merkel listens carefully to public opinion. I think Germans feel as if they have made concessions already to the UK. So it is almost as if they are trying to test the boundaries even more. We grew up with the European Union and it is normal to be Europeans. I would also feel strongly disappointed if they would leave, but I don’t care if they want to, actually. But the appetite for EU reform pushed by Britain is growing across the Continent. I think Germany is our greatest ally and our biggest friend in this renegotiation. We do have powerful allies who are ready to help us in this renegotiation because these allies themselves recognise that the EU as currently configured is not working. This is an EU that is not meeting the aspirations of many of its citizens. David Cameron travels to an EU leaders summit this Friday. He will find the winds of change are blowing. Though perhaps not in the direction he wants. He’s golf’s number one and at just 26, he already has the world at his feet. Rory Mcllroy lifted his latest trophy at the weekend at the PGA Tour event in North Carolina to bring his career total of tournament victories to 18. That includes four major championships which have helped push his total winnings to more than £36 million. Dan Roan has been talking to him about ambition, his private life and the future of golf. He may have just turned 26 but Rory Mcllroy has won almost everything his sport has to offer. The Northern Irishman is the best golfer on the planet and at the peak of his powers. Fresh from his third tournament victory of the year he told me what motivates him. I want to be the best of this generation. I want to win a lot of golf tournaments. I feel I can win a lot more Majors. I have not put a number on it because I do not want that burden on myself, but the motivation is just being driven by everyone else. This form is all the more extraordinary after a difficult 12 months. A public break up with his fiancee and tennis star Caroline Wozniacki and then a costly legal battle with his former management company. But that is now all behind him. You’re in a good place, or is that not relevant when it comes to playing? No, I think it is relevant. If you’re happy off the golf course I think you play better on it. So I’m playing well on it and it must mean everything is going well off the course as well. Tiger Woods continues to recover from a public fall from grace. So what is Rory Mcllroy learning about life in the limelight? I will never be able to do for golf what Tiger Woods did. He brought so many people into the game. It is about balancing life and he is becoming better at that with his kids, he takes being a father seriously. He has got better at it and that is something I will have to figure out in the next few years. The appeal of Rory Mcllroy has helped him become one of the highest-paid sportsmen in the world.

Here on BBC One, it’s time for the news where you are. Tonight on BBC London News: The protester assaulted by a policeman - the officer is found guilty of knocking out his tooth with his riot shield. It is always stressful for police officers, but it is never an excuse to assault anybody. A vote of confidence in London’s economy - new figures show building activity hits pre-recession levels. What this report shows is both the breadth of demand and development going on, but also that we are seeing new types of businesses. And is this what Shakespeare really looked like? A new drawing is discovered. Plus, more showers tomorrow? And will there be some for the bank holiday? Your local and national weather’s coming up. Welcome to BBC London News with me, Alice Bhandhukravi. A Metropolitan Police officer has been found guilty of injuring a man with his riot shield. Earlier that day, PC Andrew Ott had been taped on his own recording device threatening violence towards the crowds. Today he was convicted of knocking the student protestor’s tooth out. But a jury cleared both him and two other police officers of perverting the course ofjustice. Rebecca Williams reports. This was the moment William Horner had his tooth knocked out by a policeman’s riot shield. It was December 2010 and students were protesting in central London over tuition fees. Today, PC Andrew Ott has been found guilty of actual bodily harm but along with his two colleagues, Calvin Lindsay and Thomas Barnes, he was cleared of making up a reason to arrest William Horner. It has been very difficult for Will, he was a student at the time, he has a clean record and he faced the prospect of a criminal conviction which would have followed him around for the rest of his life. That day Ott had been wearing recording equipment which picked up his comments after he assaulted William Horner. PC Calvin Lindsay responded, saying this: The audio recordings also heard Ott make several derogatory comments about the protesters, including, ""I want to kill this little lot"" but in court he put that down to bravado, frustration and banter. PC Lindsay and PC Barnes were cleared of perverting the course ofjustice, insisting they heard the student say he was going to trash a church. The scenes in Central London on the day of the protests were described as ""mayhem"" and ""chaos"". In response to the audio recording, Ott said he had seen major disorder and believed that William Horner should be arrested. All public order situations where there is potentially trouble, especially riot potential in London, or anywhere else in the country, it is always stressful for police officers but it is never an excuse to assault anybody. The Independent Police Complaints Commission say all three officers will now face disciplinary hearings. Rebecca Williams, BBC News. Now, the number of cranes visible on London’s skyline is considered by some to indicate the strength of our economy. Well today new figures suggest the capital is showing strong signs of economic growth, with office construction back to pre-recession levels for the first time. Marc Ashdown is in the city for us tonight, Marc. Yes, London’s skyline this evening is lit up, dominated by high-rise buildings and lots of those red dots - they are cranes! That is good news. When the builders are busy, everyone else is, too. All this high-end office space being constructed isn’t necessarily easing the pressure on small businesses. City analysts often look to the skies for a sense of which way the economic winds are blowing and right now, appetite for construction in the city is stronger than ever. The London Office Crane Survey’s a barometer for London’s economy. Its latest report shows in the past six months, 31 new office construction projects have got under way. That means currently 9.5 million square foot of office space is in the pipeline. That’s up 24% since November. This is a huge vote in confidence for London. London is seen as being a global city, if not the global city. What this report shows is both the breadth of demand and development going on, but also that we are seeing new types of businesses, businesses already located in London, but importantly businesses are choosing London to move their businesses to to headquarter here. So what’s driving it? Another report today suggests foreign companies for one. A record 270 set up or grew here last year creating 5,000 jobs, many in the tech sector. A decade ago, 26 tech companies came to London. Last year, it attracted 108. Having a Mayor pushing London’s global image is also seen as a big factor. There are warnings that for smaller businesses there is still more demand than supply which pushes rents up. London has been a victim of its own success. Real estate investment is vital for the capital and it is vital we encourage smaller firms to incubate and grow with affordable office space, so one of the things that councils and the GLA need to do, is ensure we have continually have a supply of that stuff as well as all of the shiny expensive high-profile new buildings that clearly permeate the skyline. It is hoped pressure will ease as projects are completed and a post-General Election period often fuels the confidence to build even more. Experts say we are now back to pre-recession levels, but everyone is aware of the delicate balance to guard against another bust now the boom is back. So a vote of confidence for London, Marc, but also signs today that the impending referendum on Britain’s future and the EU has made at least one global bank a little nervous about its future in the capital? That’s right. Deutsche Bank has announced today it is reviewing its UK operations in the event of Britain pulling out of the EU. David Cameron has promised that in-out referendum by 2017. Deutsche Bank have set up a Working Group to look at the options. It’s got 9,000 staff at 16 locations around the country. It is a big player, so it’s sent ripples around the City. Some are very concerned at the knock-on effect. Others feel it could be a pragmatic approach. What Deutsche Bank have done is right. They need to consider all possible eventualities. There is a possibility - I think it’s a small one - that Britain might leave the European Union and like other big financial institutions, and indeed big companies generally, they need to consider what would they do if that happens. It is a pretty normal precaution for a big business to take. If Deutsche Bank were to go, they would leave a big gap. They have beenin would leave a big gap. They have been in the UK since 1873. The bank stressed these are early days. It does echo warnings from HSBC in April, that they too were looking at their operation. Some good news today with all this construction but also some worrying rumbles from some quarters. Tessa jowell has today formally launched her bid to become the Mayor of London. The former Olympics Minister made the announcement in her old Brixton constituency, which she stood down from this year. She’s pledged to make building more affordable homes a priority. Our ambition is to make London greater still, to build one London where every Londoner has the opportunity and the security to succeed, where Londoners have a quality of life to rival anywhere in the world. Talks to avert a national rail strike next Monday have been overshadowed by threats of legal action by Network Rail. The company has criticised the ballot held by one of the unions involved, claiming there are numerous defects. The TSSA Union say they want to settle this around the negotiating table, not in court. He may be the most famous playwright the world has ever known - and there’s no shortage of mysteries surrounding William Shakespeare, not least what he actually looked like. Now the magazine Country Life is claiming this portrait drawn by a London botanist is the true depiction of the Bard BS B yoUI’Ig ITIBFI. Nick Higham reports. He is handsome, bearded, wearing a poet’s laurels on his brow and it is claimed he is Shakespeare at the age of 33. The image is on the front of this pioneering encyclopaedia of plants published in 1597, it is crammed with the coded visual references that Elizabethans loved. Now one man says he has deciphered the code. He is a botanist and historian who designed this garden in London. He was writing a biography of the encyclopaedia’s author, john Gerard, when the penny dropped that he had found an image of Shakespeare. It was three or four in the morning, it was a midsummer night. I felt, oh, damn, that’s torn it. The Gerard thing had been coming along so beautifully, I found so much new material and the story was absolutely magnificent. And he was my star. And suddenly he was outshone. The encyclopedia was commissioned by Lord Burleigh - Mark Griffiths says this is him - and that is almost as significant as discovering what the young Shakespeare may have looked like. It is no surprise that Shakespeare knew about plants and flowers, they crop up in lots of his plays. But what is a surprise, if this new research is correct, is how close he was to Lord Burleigh, the most powerful man in England at the time of Oueen Elizabeth, her chief minister and spymaster. It puts him right at the heart of Elizabethan power politics. But what do the experts think? The boss of the Royal Shakespeare Company is intrigued because the figure is holding a newly discovered flower, a snake’s head fritillary which featured in Shakespeare’s Venus and Adonis. I can see that Shakespeare might be holding a flower that represents his great poem. Does it look like Shakespeare? He is looking, you know, he is quite sexy. That is nice. Because some of the other portraits of Shakespeare aren’t very sexy, he looks like a self-satisfied pork butcher at the Holy Trinity Church. Newly discovered portraits that might be Shakespeare are nothing new. Here is one that caused a stir a few years ago. One academic is sceptical about this latest. It is a very appealing image. It has got a kind of dynamism to it. But the idea that you would have a writer being depicted from life, which is one of the claims that is being made, on the title page of a printed book in quite this way would be pretty much unprecedented. And so it seems to me unlikely. But if this really is Shakespeare, it may tell us new things about the Bard. Nick Higham, BBC London News. Well, it’s time for me to wish you good night and I’ll leave you now with Wendy Hurrell, who has the weather. Is the worst over? I think so. Apart from one or two showers crossing Surrey right now, they are fading away and for many, it was quite a nice evening. This is how it looks. Fewer showers tomorrow, slightly warmer as well. Not so for tonight. The skies will clear as the showers fade away. Temperatures will fall and we could be at 2 or 3 Celsius. It will be a cool start to the day tomorrow. Hopefully, there will be some sunshine. Again, there will be a smattering of showers through the day. They will be lighter. There should be more opportunity to dodge around them as well. Some sunshine in between. A quick look ahead to the bank holiday weekend, it looks like there will be mostly dry conditions and some sunshine as well. Good evening. It is fair to say the atmosphere was in a very excitable state through today. Big, looming storm clouds formed across many parts of the country. There was plenty of rain and hail. Afairamount of plenty of rain and hail. A fair amount of lightning flashes as well. Well over 2,000 lightning flashes recorded this afternoon. They are now fading away and every storm cloud has a silver lining, sometimes with the odd rainbow as well! The silver lining is that things will be much drier than they have been so far and feeling a lot warmer as well. At least by day. By night, stilla bit on warmer as well. At least by day. By night, still a bit on the chilly side. That will be the case tonight. A few showers still around. Not too many, though. The odd one clipping down North East England. It will be a chilly night, temperatures around 6 or 7 Celsius. In ruralareas, it temperatures around 6 or 7 Celsius. In rural areas, it is that familiar risk of frost for some of you. So, a chilly start to Wednesday. Mostly dry and bright. We will see some sunshine in many areas. Some showers will run from North West England to the South East, heaviest around lunch time, and showers across Eastern Counties to end the day. Cloud and patchy rain will push into Northern Ireland and western Scotland. Things are improving at Chelsea, as it will for most of England and Wales into Thursday. Some good spells of sunshine. More cloud for Scotland and Northern Ireland. The cloud will break, some sunshine coming through. There will be some rain for the Highlands, coming through. There will be some rain forthe Highlands, but temperatures in the cloudier spots could get to 15 or 16. In the sunshine, centraland could get to 15 or 16.

And England face a battle to stay in the First Test against New Zealand at Lords. Good evening. Ireland has voted overwhelmingly in favour of gay marriage. In doing so, it’s become the first country in the world to approve the change in a national referendum. 62% voted in favour of amending the country’s constitution to allow gay and lesbian couples to marry. Our Ireland correspondent, Chris Buckler, reports now from Dublin Castle, where thousands of people gathered to watch the results being announced. Many campaigners saw this vote about same-sex marriage as a test of equality and acceptance in modern Ireland. They celebrated even before the initial announcement. The majority of votes in favour of the proposal, 1+67,307. There was applause inside Tupling Kassel. -- There was applause inside Tupling Kassel. -- Dublin Castle. But it was nothing compared to the reaction in the courtyard just outside were many hundreds had gathered. It’s going to be the first time that I’ve ever been able to walk down the street and not be afraid to hold her hand, because everybody says it’s oK now. Everybody says it. What does it mean to you to even hear that? It means the world. I’m not less than anyone else. Far from the celebrations in Dublin, the No vote was strongest in rural areas. Ina In a country where debates about morale tea tends to be debate -- tends to be rooted in religion, the Church’s opposition to change did have an effect. I think it goes against everything that I’ve been brought up with. Everything that I’ve learned in my Church, anyway. And I think there will be repercussions from this. There were emotional arguments about children throughout the referendum campaign and for No voters, the questions about family still have not been settled. We will not walk away from the issues, we have raised the issue of the right of a child to a mother and father and his or her identity and thoseissues father and his or her identity and those issues will continue to be debated in Ireland. Ireland’s main political parties supported changed and theyjoined the celebrations in Dublin, and for the country’s Prime Minister, this was a moment of history. This is a global first. A small country with a big message about equality and equality of opportunity. On the streets of Dublin, rainbow flags were displayed as a symbol of modern Ireland, ratherthan flags were displayed as a symbol of modern Ireland, rather than the country’s traditional tricolour. Today’s vote because -- country’s traditional tricolour. Today’s vote because -- is because Ireland’s Constitution offers specific protection for the family.

It means we are equal and valued by the people in Ireland. And people have been determined to show how much that means in a country which only legalised homosexuality two decades ago. The Bank of England has confirmed it has begun examining the financial impact of Britain leaving the EU, after it inadvertently emailed details of the confidential project to a national newspaper. Prime Minister David Cameron has promised an in-out referendum on the UK’s EU membership by the end of 2017. Our Business correspondent, joe Lynam, reports. The independent Bank of England suddenly finds itself at the centre of the next crucial question for the UK, should it remain a member of the EU? The bank itself has no opinion, but thanks to an accidental leak to a newspaper, we now know it is actively looking at what might happen if Britain left. One senior official e-mailed a handful of staff within the bank to say that no e-mail should be sent around the bank about the secret project, codenamed Bookend. They said that ifjournalists asked, they should be told that there is a lot going on in Europe, but given no details about the plans. Given the fact that we expect Bank of England officials to be thinking about every single eventuality, including a UK exit from the European Union, should we really be surprised that they are doing exactly that? It’s clearly unfortunate that it’s come out in this way, via a leak, but I don’t think we should take that seriously. It’s not as though they were doing a piece of work that they shouldn’t be doing at all, or a piece of work that surprises us. Perhaps the surprise is that they wanted to be quite so secretive about it in the first place. When it became clear that the bank had accidentally e-mailed the Guardian, it acknowledged its ‘unfortunate mistake’ and it added that it was ‘not sensible’ to talk about its work publicly. This all comes as David Cameron begins sensitive talks about Britain’s future relationship with the EU, ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. On Monday, the EU Commission President, jean-Claude juncker, will be here as part of that, and the Bank of England will gladly move back out of the limelight once that political process gets under way. Forces loyal to the Iraqi government have begun a counter offensive against the so-called Islamic State. Shia fighters launched an operation to recapture the city of Ramadi, which fell almost a week ago, and are also battling IS militants around the northern town of Baiji, which is home to the country’s largest oil refinery. From Baghdad, our World Affairs Editor, john Simpson, sent this report. After a week of dreadful headlines, the Iraqi government is hoping things may now be starting to improve. Outside Baiji, Shia volunteers, fighting alongside the Iraqi Army, have made real progress in rescuing the town from the Islamic State fighters who have been besieging it for a year now. It’s all very different from what happened at Ramadi, which fell to Islamic State last weekend. That was a serious humiliation for the Iraqi government, and gave the impression around the world that Islamic State was becoming unbeatable. It’s men like these, volunteers for the so-called Popular Mobilisation Unit, who are now trying to take Ramadi back. Islamic State’s strength is the religious fanaticism of its fighters. These volunteer groups can match that with their own drive and enthusiasm. The Iraqi Army, by contrast, simply doesn’t have the same motivation. The majority of the volunteers are Shia Muslims, who have answered the call of their religious leaders tojoin up and defend the Iraqi government. There has been a lot of anxiety about the use of Shia troops in a place like Ramadi, which is overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim. Still, the volunteer groups do contain Sunni fighters as well, and the government insists that the groups are under strict control. The Iraqi government knows it has got to change the perception that Islamic State is somehow winning this war, and it is hoping now that its efforts to recapture Ramadi and lift the siege of Baiji will do just that. john Simpson, BBC News, Baghdad. The owners of a hotel in Corfu have pledged to demolish the holiday bungalow in which two British children died. Christi and Bobby Shepherd were overcome by carbon-monoxide fumes during a family break in 2006. Earlier this month, an inquestjury ruled the children had been unlawfully killed and that the tour operator, Thomas Cook, had ""breached its duty of care"". Anna Holligan sent this report from Corfu. The former fishing village of Gouvia is popular with British tourists. Steph came here with her husband and daughters, Izzy and Leila. She didn’t realise she’d opted to stay in the same complex where the children died. I did read it a week before we came and I was disheartened and I texted him straightaway and I said, we’re going to that hotel. I did hear buzzing. I did have to turn my light off. I was kind of thinking, what’s that noise? But I think because we were in one of the refurbished rooms, Ijust thought everything was all right. Christi, aged seven, and her six-year-old brother Bobby were on a half-term break. Their bungalow had a faulty boiler. Their room was filled with carbon monoxide. The children were poisoned to death. The electrician was one of three people found guilty of negligent manslaughter and yet, remarkably, untiljust a few days ago, he was still working at the same hotel. Christos Louvros, the electrician, lives here with his two children. Neighbours tell us they are 11+ and 16 years old, which means they would have been around the same age as Christi and Bobby when they died. We tried to speak to the hotel, but no-one wanted to appear on camera. The family had pleaded for bungalow number 112, which lies just the other side of this bay, to be torn down and a playground erected in its place. Now the whole of the proceedings, including the inquest, are over, the owners say that it will be demolished, but it won’t happen immediately. They said they’re waiting until the end of the season.

104,BBC1 London,24-may-2015,BBC Weekend News,13:00,15 mins,True,"Good afternoon. Police are hunting a man after three people were found murdered in a house in Oxfordshire. The victims were a man and woman in their 40s and a girl aged six. Officers want to question 21-year-old jed Allen. Live now to Didcot, and our correspondent there, Ben Moore. Ben? Yes, it is still a lot of activity down Vicarage Road. It has been busy since about 8.30 when a concerned is member of the public raised the alarm. Shortly after, that grim discovery was made, three people, all of the same family, killed. Now a manhunt is taking place across Oxfordshire. Police were called to this leafy quiet suburb at about 8.30 last night, to find three people including a child, dead. And this is the man police are looking for. 21-year-old jed Allen, six foot tall, well built with a distinctive spider tattoo on his than. It is very important we locate him as quickly as we can. I don’t believe that there are any dangers to the wider community of Oxford, however, given the nature of what we are dealing with, it is important we find him as quickly and safely adds possible. Those who died were a lili-year-old man, a li8-year-old woman, and a girl, ofjust six. Police sayjed Allen was related to them. It shocked neighbours waking UP them. It shocked neighbours waking up to this terrible news on a bank holiday Sunday. Horrendous. I can’t just believe it is happening on our doorstep. It not very far, I can see the house from my window, actually. Yes, shocking, actually. You hear about it but you don’t expect it to happen on your doorstep. And I have got young children of my own, and it is, it is an sunsetling for them. Vicarage Road remains closed. The only people allowed in are residents if they are escorted by the police. That is because crime scene investigators are still at the house. Postmortem examinations are due to be carried out later as the search for this family’s killer continues. This lunchtime we are hearing that search now forjed Allen is ten enxxxx centring on oed for, an area called the park, we know he was a grounds keeper there, the police are saying if the public doent counter him not to approach him but to call 999. Labour has dropped its opposition to Britain holding an EU referendum. The acting leader, Harriet Harman, said Labour would campaign to stay in the European Union. The Conservatives are promising to hold a vote by the end of 2017. The business secretary said the rights of EU migrants to claim tax credits would be a key part of the renegotiating of Britain’s relationship with the EU. Here’s our political correspondent, Carole Walker. DWHITE It is quite a change. This was Ed Miliband before the election, campaigning against the Conservatives plans for a referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU. It is a clear and present danger to Britishjob, British business, British families and British prosperity. Today after the party’s resounding defeat, its acting leader confirmed Labour will support the. U Referendum Bill. There does not seem to be the public apt to wait for us to man the barricades against a referendum which appears to be going to happen, so we are saying right, we will vote for the Referendum Bill, and then get into the big questions of for and against Europe. All the candidates for the Labour leadership have said they would not oppose the referendum. The party will back some changes to our relationship with the EU, but look set to campaign for Britain to remaina member. set to campaign for Britain to remain a member. David Cameron’s begun negotiating with other EU leaders to win back powers from boroughses. One of his colleagues said the Conservatives election victory had concentrated minds across Europe. The Business Secretary said restricting tax credits was a key part of Britain’s demands. If you have someone from the EU coming to Britain, working full-time, someone with a couple of kids they will get round £700 Ea month. That is almost 8,00 pounds a yearin month. That is almost 8,00 pounds a year in tax credit. That is three times more than France would give. So you can see the pull that generates and that is the kind of thing we need to change. That is like will I to prompt some strong opposition from other E EU leaders. David Cameron has admitted he found a wall of love among his European counter pars so far, but he is stepping up the pace of negotiations, touring European capital, and meeting Europe’s most powerful figures in the coming week. At least 400 people have been killed by so-called Islamic State fighters in the ancient city of Palmyra, according to reports. Many of them are said to be women and children, according to residents inside the city. Palmyra was seized by the extremists last week. Police have been attacked at an illegal rave in Lincolnshire, leading to three women being arrested. One police officer was hit by a car and three others were hurt when they were called to the rave in Twyford Woods last night. They were responding to a complaint about loud music and came under attack from a large group of people. 500 people are said to be still there. One of Ireland’s most senior Catholic clerics has called for the Church to take a ""reality check"", following the country’s overwhelming vote in favour of same-sex marriage. Diarmuid Martin, the Archbishop of Dublin, said the Church has a ""huge task"" of reconnecting with young people. Nearly two-thirds of voters in yesterday’s referendum were in favour of changing the constitution. Andy West reports. Attending mass this morning and contemplating last night’s yes vote for same-sex marriage. Many at Dublin Cathedral voted no. I think people should keep their private life to themselves. That is my thought. We all have something to hide under the carpet. It is not how it has been said in the scripture. It is one man, one woman. Not one man to one man. The Catholic Church was the main thrust behind the no campaign, so last night’s victory for same-sex marriage reflects not only a shift in attitude towards homosexuality in the Republic of Ireland, but also a loosening of the church’s grip on people’s values. It’s very clear that if this referendum is an affirmation of the views of young people, that the church has a huge task in front of it to find the language to be able to talk to and get its message across. While 1.2 million people voted yes for same-sex marriage, it is important to remember that 743,000 people voted no. Not a small number by any means, and for many of them attending mass this morning, it is an opportunity to contemplate the fact their views on marriage might no longer be in step with the majority. I would not like to think that anybody would say to me that I was homophobic. I would absolutely hate that, because as a practising Catholic, as a Christian I love everybody. And equality, after all, is the word of the moment here. It will take a few weeks to pass the referendum result into the Republic of Ireland’s constitution. The first gay marriages are expected by the autumn. Cricket, and New Zealand have continued to pile the pressure on England on day four of the first test. After England’s slow start, the partnership of Alastair Cook and joe Root has given them much needed stability. At lunch England have a slender lead of A1 run, with seven wickets remaining. Lord’s is a Palace of the past. They were reminders everywhere of former glory, the value of experience. Plenty of that in these two batsmen, 16 thousand thrones worth, but for all the no how, you have to show how. This from Ian Bell is not how. Gone, straight way. Three balls in and a new plan needed. joe Root has seen much in the two half years since his debut and he would know how close this was. His innings saved by a blade of grass. No wonder he ajested his bat. Tape could make the difference. Here Alastair Cook survived by a layer of leather. Captain Cook is a 30-year-old who has lived a lifetime in the past few year, here was his 50. Every run valuable. Despite the tension England pushed into the lead but the nature of the match means they must balance attack with defence So England once again find themselves under pressure. At the moment it is sunny but the forecasters do predict rain. England mightjust need that. You can see more on all of today’s stories on the BBC News Channel. The next news on BBC One is at 6.35. Bye for now. Good afternoon. It has been a pretty changeable day across most parts of the UK today. We started with rain, you will probably end with sunshine. If you started with sunshine you will probably end with rain. We will seen the cold front slip across, the rain has been fragmented. We have brighter skies but equally some sharp showers developing in the north and west of Scotland. The everyone side of Scotland will be quite well. Northern England brightens up. There will be a fresher feel compared with yesterday as that north-westerly winds coming down, but still a much brighter afternoon, quite the contrary in the south-east of enland after a sunny start, with that cloud and outbreaks of rain. Light and patchy. Any rain should clear away from the south-west of England, still fair bit of cloud in the afternoon, most of Wales is brightening up, particularly in the knot and west, that fresher feel to things here. In Northern Ireland, again, most places enjoying a accident afternoon but there is the chance of one or two showers on the north coast in particular. In the evening we will lose the rain from the south-east corner. We keep the showers going, but in between there is a lot of fine and dry weather to be had it it may turn cloudy. Still, temperatures in major towns and cities getting into single figures, so a a chillish start to Bank Holiday Monday. There is a good deal of dry weather on offer. We are in between to weather fronts, a nose of high pressure should help keep things dry. A bit of drizzle in the north-west, that tends to ease away. Showers possible, through the afternoon, but many places having a decent Bank Holiday Monday. 17 or so degrees in London but for many it is only the low teens. Then the rest of this week. It is fine at first. Most of Monday, Tuesday,s we, most places doing well. It turns a bit wetter and windy later this week. So, Bank Holiday Monday into Tuesday, we have this weak weather front in the UK, don’t expect to see much rain on that, but we can expect a bit of cloud, so a cloudy but dry start to Tuesday. The cloud lifting and breaking for, some brighter spells developing. Stilla breaking for, some brighter spells developing. Still a few showers in the far north and west. By Wednesday it looks like like we have this area of high pressure. A bit more of a breeze in the far north-west. That is where we will see a few showers but the rest the UK doing well on Wednesday, a lot of drier weather. A bit cloudy in place, maybe the best of the breaks on Wednesday. Then it goes down hill Wednesday night into Thursday. There are question marks about shape and depth of this low. At the moment the general consensus there will be some rain across the UK. Gusts could get up to 15mph, maybe 60mph in a few place, so a pel is spell wet windy weather followed by potentially thundery showers, then cool air comes down on the north-westerly breeze. I will spread across all parts so a chilly start to the end of the week. It won’t last for too long. We lose that wind, pick up more of a westerly, that will allow this next low to come in, later on the day on Friday. Not as windy as Wednesday night into Thursday, but still a breeze and rain. It looks like further north and east you are it is Today, there’s a special buzz in the air here in Oswestry, and it’s not because we’ve got a fair simply stuffed with treasures. BUZZING Oh! That’s better. It’s because we’ve got a one-hour-long special edition that’s sure to fly by. Who writes this stuff? Let’s go bargain hunting! Yeah! Unlike the proverbial leopard, who never changes his spots, today, we are changing the rules...slightly. I’m asking the experts to find not one, but two bonus buys, which they’ll then show me, I’ll give them an opinion, but will the teams decide to take one, or the other, or none, and who will be right and who will be wrong?

Thank you. The American Defence Secretary has criticised the Iraqi Army, saying it lacks the ""will to fight"" Islamic State militants. Ashton Carter accused troops of abandoning their positions in the strategic city of Ramadi, despite outnumbering IS fighters. The fall of Ramadi, just 70 miles west of Baghdad, is seen as an embarrassment for the Iraqi government. Our World Affairs Editor, john Simpson, reports now from Baghdad. The Bzebiz bridge over the Euphrates, a choke point on the road between Ramadi and Baghdad. Tens of thousands of people have come across this bridge in the last week, desperate to get away from the Islamic State fighters who have captured the town. All these people feel they have been badly let down by the Iraqi government and especially by the Iraqi Army. Back here in Baghdad, the loss of Ramadi was a really serious blow, even though it was just the result of the one man, the Brigadier in command in Ramadi, losing his nerve. It was a serious shock to Iraq’s friends and allies too. The Iraqi forces just showed no will to fight. They were not outnumbered. Infact, they vastly outnumbered the opposing force. Understandably, the Brigadier General who speaks for the Iraqi forces doesn’t accept that. Our army and our guys have the will to fight. But sometimes, it is a battle and there is a circumstance and this circumstance has forced units back, or to be in another way. But it doesn’t mean that we don’t have the will or we cannot tackle it. But if, against the outside world’s expectations, Iraq can fight off Islamic State, it certainly isn’t happening in neighbouring Syria. The capture of Palmyra and reported loss of life there are further signs that in Syria, Islamic State is winning the war. The President of the European Commission will meet David Cameron at the Prime Minister’s country residence at Chequers tomorrow, and they’re expected to discuss Britain’s renegotiations with the European Union. Today, the Business Secretary, Sajid javid, said the rights of EU migrants to claim tax credits would be a key part of any new deal. The Conservatives are promising to hold an in-out referendum on the UK’s membership of the EU, by the end of 2017. Our Political Correspondent, Chris Mason, has more. Plenty attempted to visit a stately home on a bank holiday weekend. When the European Commission President rolls up here tomorrow at Chequers, we are told he will receive a friendly welcome and dinner, even though not long ago, David Cameron was trying to stop him getting hisjob. Are you certain you will be Commission President? I don’t give interviews now. Do you mind that Britain are trying to stop you becoming President? just last year, David Cameron was doing his best to block Mr juncker’s appointment. We hear a lot about you, but we don’t hear from you. Mr Cameron failed in that mission, so is now working with him, as the Prime Minister renegotiates the terms of Britain’s EU membership. Those around the Prime Minister emphasise this is the beginning of the process of renegotiation, the equivalent of the opening overs in a five-day cricket match. So what is achievable and what isn’t? There is likely to be a red light for capping the number of immigrants from the EU, that is widely seen as incompatible with the idea of the European Union. Plenty of other issues do appear negotiable, such as reducing migrants’ access to benefits. And there are some ideas that should be fairly easy to get the green light for, such as cutting red tape and securing trade deals. This morning, the new Business Secretary said shaking up the rules on benefits was important. If you have someone from the EU coming to Britain, working full-time, with a couple of kids, they will get around £700 a month, that is almost £8,000 a year, in tax credits. That is twice as much as Germany, three times more than France, so you can see the pull that generates, and that is the kind of thing we need to change. So the Prime Minister is on the lookout for deals and will spend much of the week hopping from one European capital to another, shaking hands and twisting arms. Three police officers have been injured, one of them seriously, after coming under attack at an illegal rave in Lincolnshire.

In 1959, he had paranoid allusions and the rest of his career was lost to mental illness, even though he started to recover in the 1990s. So he made incredibly deep results with a career that was short, only about ten years, and for that, he was a giant of mathematics.

Hull City have been relegated on the last day of the Premier League season. They drew nil-nil with Manchester United, while Newcastle survived after beating West Ham 2-0. Our reporter Ben Smith is at St james Park in Newcastle for us. Where I imagine they’re all pretty relieved, Ben? That is right. The overwhelming emotion at Stjames’s Park is relief. Total, simple relief. Newcastle came into this game knowing they needed a victory to make sure of another season in the Premier League and that is what they delivered. It was good to errors who has overcome testicular cancer recently to make it safe for Newcastle -- it was down to good to errors.

There’s more throughout the evening on the BBC News Channel, we are back Goodbye. Good evening, I’m Asad Ahmad. An innocent woman who was injured after being caught-up in a shoot-out between drug dealers in Kilburn, and whose best friend was shot dead, says she’s been let down by those who promised to move her to safety. Two years on, Sabrina Gachette is afraid to go out of her home in Camden, where the families of those who attacked her, are living nearby. She’s been speaking to Sarah Harris. It is -- it is not yet two years since 26-year-old Sabrina witnessed the murder of her best friend and she was shot in the back after they sheltered in the rain after a night out in North London. It had been Sabrina’s birthday but I ended up in the wrong place, at the wrong time, in the crossfire of rival drug gangs -- they ended up. It is clear she is still suffering. I am always compared to somebody who died, so in comparison to her, I should just get over it because I survived. What about comparing me to somebody who did not go through it? People do not look at it that way. This CCTV footage shows the men before they opened fire. They are in jail but that is how Sabrina feels about how she is living, a prisoner, afraid to go out. The family asked to move but they say the fear is still there. I am so exposed. Every person that comes into this area, Ido not know who is looking to me -- comes into this area, Ido not know who is looking to me -- at me and who is behind me. I am by myself at a easyjunction and it is always busy here. Her mother says the trauma is felt by the whole family, she believes they should be rehoused and amply supported. Our lives have been taken away. We had a good life where we were before. But living here, it isjust, everybody is angry with each other. In a statement, Camden Council said it is looking to swap this property with another tenant but that there is a chronic shortage of housing in the area. What is clear is that for a family trying to cope with the consequences of such a violent crime, the scars still run deep. Police say they’re concerned for the safety of a 16-year-old girl from Bexley, who’s thought to have run away with a man aged in his fifties. They’re describing the disappearance of Kaylie Hatton And officers fear for their safety. Kaylie is 15 and macro to is 51 and a family friend, since last Sunday, the pair have been missing-- Fred Finch. She was reported missing on the 15th, extremely concerned for her safety. She is 16 and we have had no contact from Kaylie since the 17th since repeated requests. We made contact with friends and family, and to this day, no contact. It is understood Kaylie argued with her grandmother last Friday night and then ran away, climbing out of the window at her grandmother’s house. She was last seen at a friend’s how symbolic at 8pm last Sunday. It is thought the two will store be in the area -- Sunday. It is thought the two will store be in the area -- friend’s house. Two have been spotted in the area and they have been seen on the number 96 nearby. And it is thought they have been going to local leisure centres and using the showers. People across South East London and Kent are being as to help. She has blonde hair we believe she may have died black. Last seen wearing a white T-shirt with a Gold chain, she does wear glasses but has been known not to wear them. Although she is 16, she does look a lot older. Police say they deal with missing people every day but this case is out of the ordinary because the two are high risk. West Ham have announced manager Sam Allardyce is to leave the Hammers after four years at the Premier League club. The 60-year-old oversaw the Hammers’ promotion from the Championship in 2012, but was never universally popular with the East London side’s fans. West Ham say they have a shortlist of possible replacements, and will make ""significant transfer funds"" available. Let’s take a look at the Bank Holiday weather now with Sara. Good evening, the rain this afternoon is clearing towards the South. Behind it, we have clearer skies and you might see bright weather in the North and clearer skies filtering to London tomorrow morning. Coolair underthe skies filtering to London tomorrow morning. Cool air under the clear skies, temperatures could fall as low as six, seven Celsius. At. But right tomorrow. We will see cloud through the middle part of the afternoon. A touch of drizzle possible, mostly dry. Cool, 14, 15 Celsius. 17 degrees in Central London. Dry on Tuesday and through the middle part of the week. Some cloud and bright spells. Temperatures to 19, 20. On Thursday, we will see a period of rain and it will be windy. That’s it for now. I hope you canjoin me again for our next news at 10:20 on BBC one. Until then, enjoy your evening. Good evening. If the prospect of an extra day off tomorrow has put a smile on your face, hopefully the bmmu smile on your face, hopefully the forecast will not stand that. Bank holiday Monday should be dry for most of you, cloud in places but leaving blue skies at at times. Blue skies should finish Sunday. This cloud has been producing rain and drizzle today. That will soon disappear and through the night, most of us will be dry, clear skies, some showers will continue in Scotland. A rather cool night, temperatures into the start of bank holiday Monday up to 9 degrees, so not a scorcher. But a reasonably pleasant day. Morning showers in Northern Ireland, Scotland and North West England, scattered, and most of us will be dry. The best of the sunshine during the morning away from the showers, before cloud built through the afternoon at at times, so not a completely blue sky day but sunshine will rain through every now and again through Wales, the Midlands, Southern England. 16, 17 Celsius was able in North West winds. Cooler in North West England and the potential for isolated showers to the East of the Pennines, and a brighter afternoon for parts of Northern Ireland and western Scotland with sunny spells and showers few and far between.

After the Iraqi’s Army retreat from Islamic State fighters in a key battle, the US Defence Secretary says they have ""no will to fight."" But with refugees continuing to flee IS control, the Iraqi Prime Minister tells the BBC his forces will retake the city of Ramadi within days. It makes my heart bleed, because we lost Ramadi, but I can assure you we can ringgit back soon. The Nobel Prize-winning mathematicianjohn Nash, whose life inspired a Hollywood film, has died in a car crash. And Lewis Hamilton misses out on a near-certain win at Monaco, because of a tactical error by his own team. Good evening. Armed police in Oxfordshire are searching for a man wanted in connection with the murder of three people, found dead at their home in Didcot. jed Allen, who’s 21, is the son of one of the victims, and tonight police have sealed off the Oxford University parks area, where he worked as a groundsman. The bodies of Philip Howard, janetjordon and her daughter Derrin were discovered last night. They’d all suffered stab wounds. Sarah Campbell reports. Murdered in the family home, janet jordon and her six-year-old daughter Derrinjordon, along with Philip Howard. The messages left by friends and neighbours alongside flowers and soft toys reflect a sense of shock. For more postmortem will not take place until tomorrow. We are able to say that the likely cause of each of their deaths is stab wounds. This man, janetjordon’s their deaths is stab wounds. This man, janet jordon’s 21-year-old son, jed Allen, is the prime suspect according to police. Prolific on social media, in some photographs he’s shown holding knives. 6-foot tall, he has a large tattoo of a spider on his left hand. The owner of the studio who drew the design remembers him well. I think it was the beginning of this year when he came in with friends. Seemed like a nice enough chap, was really polite and everything. The search quickly moved to the University Parks in Oxford. The 70 acre site was sealed off to the public and it became clear as the afternoon will warn that this was an area of particular interest to police. jed Allen used to be a groundsman, and as helicopters and police combed the area, Moore was becoming known about the police’s main suspect. The police have warned not to approach jed Allen. Anyone with information should call them. Vicarage Road has been cordoned off to the public, with those living nearby struggling to take in that three murders could take place so close to home. And there is a heavy police presence here this evening at vicarage Road with forensics team is expected back here in the morning. The search of the large area of parkland in Oxford continues. Police are asking for anyone who may have seen or heard anything here yesterday afternoon or anyone who knows anything about the rarer whereabouts ofjed Allen rarer whereabouts of jed Allen should rarer whereabouts ofjed Allen should contact them. The American Defence Secretary has criticised the Iraqi army, saying it lacks the ""will to fight"" Islamic State militants. Speaking to CNN’s State of the Union Program Ashton Carter accused troops of abandoning their positions in the strategic city of Ramadi, despite ""vastly outnumbering"" IS fighters. Today there’s been heavy fighting around Ramadi as Iraqi forces and their allies attempt to take the city back. Across the border in Syria, there have been mass executions by IS in the historic city of Palmyra. ~ -- reports of "" I’âpOIâtS of ITIBSS Our World Affairs Editorjohn Simpson has this report from Baghdad. It has been a week when Islamic State seemed to be winning hands down. Capturing Palmyra in Syria and Ramadi in Iraq. In Palmyra in particular the Iraqi army did not seem to put up a fight, theyjust ran for it. In America, the Defence Secretary Ashton Carter went on one of the chat shows today and was scathing about the Iraqis. The Iraqi soldiers showed no will to fight. They were not outnumbered. Infact they vastly outnumbered the opposing force. His remarks clearly annoyed the Iraqi Prime Minister, asl force. His remarks clearly annoyed the Iraqi Prime Minister, as I found when I went to see him. It’s positively insulting, isn’t it? I’m surprised that he said that. He was very supportive of Iraq. I’m sure he was fed with the wrong information. Nevertheless Ramadi was a disaster, wasn’t it? It makes my heart bleed because we lost Ramadi, but I can assure you we can bring it back soon. You say soon, what are we talking about? Months? No, I’m talking about days. If the Iraqi government does recapture Ramadi, it can’t come soon enough for these people. Some of the tens of thousands who have been escaping across the bridge over the River Euphrates, desperate to get away from Islamic State fighters who are holding Ramadi now. It’s boiling hot, well over Ao Celsius. This little boy has been here three days now. Ijust want to go home, he says. These people are Sunnis, and they have not had cause to love much of the Shias part of the occupation. But a group of Shias have shown up to see if they can help and they have brought food and water to help the refugees on their way. All these people think they have been badly let down by their government and army. We will soon see whether the Prime Minister is right when he says he will get Ramadi back within days. Our World Affairs Editorjohn Simpson is in Baghdad for us now - We wonder what happens now, is the Army really capable of taking Ramadi back within a few days? Perhaps it does sound a little bit surprisingly. Certainly Western diplomats here, Western military observers all agree that it is possible. I think one of the problems is that Islamic State is so fantastically good at promoting itself, and the Iraqi government is pretty useless at telling people of its achievements. It has won back the important oil town in the last couple of days. But you would scarcely know about it. They have to to push on, pick up other places in the province that Islamic State has captured. And also the third most important city in Iraq, Mosul is also held by IS. Today the Prime Minister said to me he thought they could do that before the end of the year. Earlier he was talking to me, a few months ago, saying that they would be able to do it in the spring. So that has fallen back. But it is a possibility. And observers here think it’s a realistic possibility. Greece’s interior minister has said the country can’t make a debt repayment of more than a billion pounds to the International Monetary Fund next month, because it doesn’t have the money. But Nikos Voutsis, said he was still cautiously optimistic a deal could be done to relax further loans. And the President of the European Commission will meet David Cameron at his country residence at Chequers tomorrow, and they’re expected to discuss Britain’s renegotiations with the European Union.

This morning the new Business Secretary shaking UP the new Business Secretary shaking up the deals on benefits was important. If you have somebody coming to the UK from Europe, with a couple of kids, working full-time, they will get almost £8,000 per year in tax credits, twice as much as Germany, three times as much as France would give. You can see the poll that generates and that’s the kind of thing we need to change. Some say that Britain is often seen in Europe as the grumpy uncle at the Christmas party and needs to get the tone right. We need to look at how France behaves in negotiations with Europe. They always present the needs important to their own national country as being in the European interests. Britain needs to be just as good at playing the European game as its European partners. Tonight the Prime Minister announced that lots of migrants from elsewhere in Europe now living here will not get a vote in the referendum. His focus now is on looking out for deals, shaking hands and twisting arms. john Nash, the mathematician whose remarkable life inspired the film A Beautiful Mind, has been killed in a car crash in America.

Police in Malaysia say they’ve discovered a number mass graves discovered a number of mass graves near the Thai border. It’s thought more than 100 bodies could be buried close to abandoned camps near Perlis used by people smugglers. Many of the victims are thought to be Rohingya Muslims fleeing persecution in Myanmar. Well, the publicity surrounding the plight of the Rohingya has led to a crackdown on trafficking networks, and that’s resulted in many ships being forced back to Myanmar. But even then their ordeal isn’t over. Often the traffickers hold them hostage, until their families pay ransoms. Our correspondent jonah Fisher reports from Rakhine state in Myanmar. They are emptying the boats of mine ma’s West Coast, but the traffickers have not given up on making money. This Rohingya Maslin was ransomed and freed last weekend after two and a half months stuck on a boat that never set out across the sea. -- this Rohingya Moslem. The traffickers heard their people in Thailand were on the run and being hunted by police, so they decided to send us back to the land. She took us to the spot where the traffickers had brought her back on shore. So, three nights agojust by had brought her back on shore. So, three nights ago just by those coconut trees over there by the sea, thatis coconut trees over there by the sea, that is where you were brought on shore by the traffickers, with about 50 other people. Looking 100 metres across to the left, that building there is a police checkpoint. Hello. We went to ask the police if they had seen anything. We heard a trafficking boat landed here on Sunday night, we wondered if you had any information. They told us they had heard nothing. That Sunday night, her mother was contacted and immediately paid a ransom. But her close friend was not released. TRANSLATION: My friend is owned by another traffic from Malaysia, so when we were brought back on shore they asked for $300 for her. When the money could not be found they took her away. We went to see the missing girl’s mother. She told me she was desperately looking for her daughter and was so worried she was founding it hard to eat. That evening she called us back, she had found the woman, but the traffickers were refusing to give her up. We took her to the police, who said they doubted the story and suggested that the woman might have in fact married her trafficker. You really think this girl might have fallen in love with this guy who is keeping her? If two people are confined together then romance can blossom, he said. Very much on their own, the Rohingya have had to make their own arrangements. Last Saturday this woman was distraught as a ransom was negotiated for her husband. A small piece of good news for the persecuted and exploited Rohingya. Now, with all the sport we go to the BBC sports Centre. The Premier League and Scottish Premiership seasons drew to a close today. If you want to wait to watch Match of the Day or Sportscene to find out what happened, it’s time to turn down the sound and look away. Newcastle United will remain in the top flight after beating West Ham 2-0 at St james’ Park. They needed to win to guarantee survival. Their victory relegated Hull who could only manage a 0-0 draw against Manchester United. They dropped down just 12 months after reaching the FA Cup final.

Earlier police have released CCTV images ofjed Allen, spotted at Oxford railway station on Saturday night. His mother, daughterand her partnerwere night. His mother, daughterand her partner were found stabbed to death in their house on Saturday. Police said they have recovered a weapon from the crime scene. We will have the latest. David Cameron begins talks with the head of the European Commission about plans for an EU referendum. The First Minister of Northern Ireland, Peter Robinson, is in hospital, after suffering a suspected heart attack. And Norwich City celebrate their return to the Premier League. Good evening. In the last 30 minutes detect is looking forjed Allen, suspected of killing three members of his family, have discovered his body. Officers say it was found in a wooded area in Oxford. He had been sought after his young sister, his mother and her partner were found stabbed to death at their home in Didcot on Saturday. Our Correspondentjon Brain is in Didcot. Well it was that eight 30 on Saturday night that police discovered three bodies at a house here on Vicarage Road. Since then the focus of the investigation has been on one and only suspect. 23-year-old jed Allen. Within the past few minutes the police said they have discovered what they believe is his body. It was found in woodland by a couple of members of the public. The last recorded sighting ofjed Allen. Seen on CCTV in a store at Oxford rail station at around six o’clock on Saturday evening. Two and a half hours later, the bodies of his sister, Derrinjordan, and motherjanet and her partner Philip Howard were discovered. They’d been stabbed to death at this house in Didcot. Today, investigators retrieved what they believed was the weapon used to kill them. 23-year-old Mr Allen worked as a groundsman at Oxford University. This afternoon, search teams went back to parkland where they had been yesterday. It appears new information prompted their return. Within the past few minutes they announced they found the body, believed to be his. No formal identification has taken place but I’m satisfied that this is the body ofjed Allen who was previously named as a suspect in this investigation. While the police were looking for her brother, classmates of Derrinjordan came to her school. They came in on the bank holiday to help come to terms with what had happened. They knew the kids were going to find things out, we didn’t want to tell the kids what had happened, we were trying to hide it. Today has been a way of bringing them all together and helping each other. It is better than adults crying. Do you think the children understand what has happened? No, not really. They can’t process it in that sense. They know that she is not coming back to school, we’ve discussed that. They haven’t got the details. You can’t. They can’t understand that. They shouldn’t have to. The headteacher says the school and the community as a whole is heartbroken. Absolute devastation, when it comes to shock, we are stunned. How can you begin to comprehend what has happened. Such an awful tragedy to such a beautiful little girl. And she was a very sweet, happy, precious little child. Inside the school now, a temporary memorial for a little girl who won’t be coming back. Some additional information. We are told the body was in woodland adjacent to Marston Road in Oxford. That was an area that had not previously been searched by police. The families of the victims have been informed of this latest development. David Cameron is to host the European Commission president jean-Claude juncker at Chequers this evening - in the first of a series of one-to-one meetings with European leaders this week. The Prime Minister will be setting out his plans to bring power back from Brussels. The meeting with Mrjuncker comes as Downing Street laid out the terms of who will be eligible to vote in the EU referendum. Ross Hawkins is at Chequers. jean-Claude juncker was set to arrive for dinner around now. We have just seen a motorcade turn-up. He said he wants a fair deal for Britain but in all-- but until recently he was publicly at odds with David Cameron and he isjust one of many European leaders of the Prime Minister will have to convince. Can dinner at an English country house on a summer’s evening charm jean-Claude juncker? Mrjunker, are you certain you will be Commission president? David Cameron will hope so, because this is what the Prime Minister said about him last summer. jean-Claudejuncker has been at the heart of the project to increase the power of Brussels and reduce the power of nation states for his entire working life. He is not the right person to take his organisation forward. But jean-Claude juncker got the job as commission president and now the UK needs allies. So on Thursday David Cameron will have breakfast in Denmark with the Prime Minister there. Then a trip to the Netherlands for talks with the Dutch Prime Minister. Before dinner with President Hollande in France. Then on Friday a meeting with the Polish Prime Minister in Warsaw. Before talks with Angela Merkel in Germany. And a crucial European Council meeting injune. All that will help decide what EU reform deal the Prime Minister can get to put to the people in the first vote on Britain’s place in Europe since 1975. Today’s Conservatives have already decided that most EU citizens won’t get a say. British, Irish, and Commonwealth adults in the country will be able to vote in the EU referendum, so will Britons who have lived abroad for less than 15 years. And Maltese and Cypriot citizens because they are Commonwealth countries. But voters from the other EU nations living here will not. I think it’s perfectly sensible. I mean, that’s the basis on which we have general elections. That’s the franchise for a general election and I think it’s appropriate you have the same franchise. So I don’t think any great surprises there. Both the SNP and Labour say 16 and 17-year-olds should get a vote on Europe. This is about extending the franchise. And this particular group of voters, they’re going to be hugely affected, as will everybody else, by the referendum and the outcome of it. I hope Britain will vote to stay in. But I think it’s important that everyone can play their part, including 16 and 17-year-olds. Plenty of mixing with European leaders ahead, then, but how many of his demands will they accept before voters decide whether they want Britain to stay in this club? So do not expect David Cameron to emerge this evening with any kind of breakthrough. Norfor his emerge this evening with any kind of breakthrough. Nor for his tour of European capitals in the coming week. A crush time will come for the negotiations, but notjust yet. And even then the job will only be partly done. Once he has some kind of deal David Cameron will have to sell the idea to his Conservative colleagues and then ultimately to the British people at large for a referendum on Britain’s future in the European Union. Northern Ireland’s First Minister Peter Robinson has been admitted to hospital with a suspected heart attack. Mr Robinson, who is 66, has been First Minister since 2008. He’s being treated at Belfast’s Royal Victoria Hospital- our Ireland correspondent Chris Buckler is in Belfast. What is the latest? Mr Robinson was taken ill earlier this morning and is still a patient at the cardiac ward in the Royal Victoria Hospital this evening. They released a short statement and said he underwent the procedure this morning. They would not be any more specific and his family have requested privacy at this time. Party colleagues and political rivals have been wishing him a speedy recovery and showing their support. Amongst them the deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness who made clear that his thoughts were with the Robinson family. But he did notjust talk about the personal but also the political because Mr Robinson has been taken ill on the evening of another crucial vote at Stormont over the issue of welfare reform. An issue with threatens the future of the assembly itself. Benefit changes that have been introduced in other parts of the UK have not been introduced in Northern Ireland, they have been blocked by nationalist politicians. The DUP finance minister says that threatens their ability to put together a budget and even threatens the future of the assembly itself. It is not clear what Mr Robinson’s illness will have in terms of an effect, crisis. A jury has been told that the former editor of the News of the World, Andy Coulson, knew that Milly Dowler’s phone had been intercepted. Andy Coulson is on trial at the High Court in Edinburgh, accused of lying under oath in a 2010 perjury trial. Neville Thurlbeck, who was the paper’s chief reporter, told the court that Mr Coulson had seen transcripts of voicemail messages left on the missing schoolgirl’s phone.

The confiscation order is one of the largest seen in Scotland The Chancellor George Osborne has made it clear that English towns and counties can’t expect the same powers as those being offered to big cities, as part of what he’s called a ""devolution revolution"". Some rural council leaders fear being left behind, as the government redraws the power structures of England in urban areas. The local government association is urging ministers to extend their plans to every corner of the country. Our Home Editor Mark Easton reports from the Derbyshire Dales. The Prime Minister has promised a fairer deal for England, the Chancellor has offered new powers to English cities, but no one has yet come up with an answer to what might be called the Hathersage question. Hathersage sits on the edge of the Peak District. One way and there is the rural beauty of the Derbyshire Dales, the other and it is just a few miles to the urban metropolis around Sheffield. For the village and the Dales, there is a choice to be made. join the South Yorkshire metropolitan super council, hoping to take control of billions from Whitehall, or ally itself with rural Derbyshire that may see far less in terms of local autonomy. As power is carved up, which option would the local butchers choose? I would say Sheffield with its closeness of proximity. Definitely. Same here. In the old stables of Hathersage Hall is a new business park. The owner’s family has roots in the village going back centuries. Our heart is in Derbyshire and we want Derbyshire’s identity to be maintained. We do not want to be subsumed into some great metropolitan organisation but if there is money there, we want to be part of it. England’s towns and rural counties are being offered ""devo-lite"" compared to big cities. In Hathersage, the local council leader explains the Dales have joined two separate super councils. One camp is Sheffield City region which we are right next door to here and obviously we are in the county of Derbyshire which is a totally different area, mainly rural. Would you like to see a lot more power devolved to this area? Absolutely we would welcome it. The local government association is urging ministers to extend major devolution to non-urban England as well as cities. That, it says, would deliver savings of £20 billion, growth of £80 billion, 700,000 new jobs and 500,000 new homes. 56% of England’s growth comes from non-metropolitan areas, places like this new business park in North East Derbyshire. The county’s council leader fears rural English communities are being treated as second-class citizens. I’m not going to sit back as the leader of Derbyshire and say I’m happy for us to be the empty space between the south-east and the northern powerhouse. We are a strong place in our own right, we can contribute so much more and surely that is what the Chancellor wants. Hathersage supposedly features in the noveljane Eyre and like the title character of Charlotte Bronte’s masterpiece, the village must decide how best to achieve the independence it yearns. Police in Malaysia have confirmed that nearly 140 graves linked to human trafficking have been found near the border with Thailand.

Cricket, and in the last hour England have won the first test against New Zealand. The visitors were left chasing an England lead of 344 but the day started well for the hosts - and they never looked back. joe Wilson is at Lord’s. The floodlights were on for a fuel hours and it feels like English cricket has been battering against gloom for months. A hard fight over five days against New Zealand. On Thursday morning, afterjust an hour it seemed like England were sunk. They have proved a great deal to a lot of people. How far did interest in English cricket stretch? All the way down one side of Lourdes and around the corner, and right back to Saintjohn ‘s Wood tube station where the queue £20 tickets were tempted by the scent of victory. The team responded. New Zealand needed 345 to win. They lost two wickets without a run on the broad. Stuart Broad on a hot streak. England only stopped for lunch. Behind the scenes, activity. Director Andrew Strauss scenes, activity. Director Andrew Strauss settled on an Australian Trevor Bayliss as first choice for coach. Today, the job was done by Paul Farbrace. A breakthrough from Ben Stokes. You can see how significant his team-mates thought it was. It got better next ball. Brendon McCullum old. Anderson’s logic was I can’t get off if I am working the ball to the boundary. But he couldn’t avoid a fierce delivery from Mark Ward. Why was joe Root given the ball? Maybe for this. Anderson LBW. Back came Stokes. Say no more. The only bowler who hadn’t contributed was Moeen Ali. Until now. That was a good catch. No, this is a good catch. 220 loud. It took England had to take this victory. They reached discovered themselves at the home of cricket. Alastair Cook showed strong and calm leadership and a big century for him in this Test match in the second innings. Then Stokes was the man of the match and he has that Ian Botham, Andrew Flintoff quality for English fans to get behind. Remember, five more tests against Australia to come in the Ashes. Right now, England will be talking about this test being a victory for a team, indeed, for mutual trust. Thank you, joe Wilson at Lord’s.

She says she’s determined to make the hospital change the way it works, as Emma North reports. Allan Hawdon and his partner had been a couple for more than a quarter of a century. We were together all of the time. We weren’t insulated but we were together all the time. He was admitted to hospital after covering up blood. When she came to see him come his bed was empty. -- When she came to see him come his bed was empty. -- coughing up blood. He bled to death in the toilet. I rushed in and he was sidewise -- sideways and it was obvious that he was dead but I didn’t think of that at the time. I tried to breathe into his mouth and talk to him. That was probably only a few seconds but it seemed a long time. The hospital said the death was inevitable but denied they hadn’t taken his case seriously enough. They did admit the search could have been more thorough. I don’t know how long how -- how long he was dead in there. I don’t know if he died in pain. All I know is he died in that toilet on his own. Report shows the hospital had failed in its care. Homerton Hospital says since Alan’s depth of it has introduced a rapid response system and from july, it will record conditions electronically, which it says should speed up staff response times. They have said they are happy to meet Susan to talk about their action plan. If I knew they would improve and it wouldn’t happen to anyone else, I would also like more people to complain because so many people don’t because it is so hard.

Northern Ireland’s First Minister Peter Robinson has been admitted to hospital after a suspected heart attack. Mr Robinson, who’s 66, has been First Minister since 2008. He’s being treated at Belfast’s Royal Victoria Hospital. His illness means he will miss a major debate about welfare reform, due to take place at Stormont tomorrow. Earlier this month, militants from Islamic State seized the Iraqi city of Ramadi. Its fall was seen as a major capitulation on the part of the Iraqi Army in the strategically important Anbar Province. Since then, Iraqi government forces, backed by Shia militias, have been mobilising there in a bid to take the fight to IS. Our World Affairs Editor, john Simpson, travelled with a group of Shia militias to the town of Garma in Anbar, and sent this report. Anbar province, vast, empty, basically desert, and natural territory for Islamic State. It has been a battle ground for years. America’s built the fortifications when they were here. Now, as then, the enemy’s weapon of choice is the roadside bomb. We reach Garma. IS has been forced out of the rest of the town. We are with the Popular Mobilisation Unit. Commanded by a dapper character in a uniform of his own devising. The militias are the only government troops who seem able to resist Islamic State’s Pharos fatigue. But, Anbar province is Sunni Muslim. -- fatigue. But, Anbar province is Sunni Muslim. -- ferocity. TRANSLATION: I carry the flag of Iraq because I represent the whole of Iraq.

A court in Edinburgh has been told that the former editor of the News of the World, Andy Coulson, knew that Milly Dowler’s phone had been intercepted. Andy Coulson is accused of lying under oath in a 2010 perjury trial. Chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck told jurors that Mr Coulson had seen transcripts of voicemail messages left on the missing schoolgirl’s phone. The mobile phone provider O2 says it’s looking into problems with its network. The company says it is aware of what it called ""isolated instances"" across the UK, where customers are experiencing intermittent service. The Business Secretary Sajid javid told the phone operator via Twitter to sort it out. It’s nearly four years since the militant group Al-Shabab was driven out of the Somali capital, Mogadishu. It’s lost much of the territory it once controlled but retains the ability to carry out high-profile attacks there, and in Kenya. However, Somalia’s government says it is weakening the leadership of Al-Shabab, through a combination of American drone strikes, and an amnesty programme for high-level defectors. Our Africa correspondent, Andrew Harding, has been to Mogadishu, where he had exclusive access to one former Al-Shabab commander. A crowded beach in, of all places, Mogadishu. A sign perhaps that Somalia is finally on the mend, or another false dawn. A suicide attack in the city by Al-Shabab. The militants remain a big threat here. The Government insists it is turning the tide. To back up that claim we are escorted to a secret location, to meet one of Al-Shabab’s most senior commanders. Zakariya was the head of military intelligence for the terrorist group. America put a $3 million price on his head. Now he is the defector, sickened, he claims, by the group’s shift for attacking civilian targets. I asked Zakariya for his reaction to Al-Shabab’s massacre of 148 students in Garissa, Kenya. Really shocked. Really shocked? You knew the organisation, you must have known this was likely. This is what they do. This is not the right things. What would you say to the parents of those students who died in Garissa? I really am very sorry. I am sending my condolences to them - to their families and parents and colleagues who are elsewhere. What would you say to your former colleagues in Al-Shabab who are plotting and planning and carrying out more? I would say to them to stop such things. Targeting civilians is not a legitimate thing. Al-Shabab remains a dangerous force in Somalia. It is losing territory fast and it is under huge military pressure. The Somali government believes now is the moment to use the carrot, as well as the stick, to try to lure in more top-level defectors. It is notjust Al-Shabab’s leaders being targeted. We head inland. The militants once controlled all of this. Now the balance is shifting. A government camp for fighters who have surrendered, including one woman, who was kidnapped by Al-Shabab as a schoolgirl. They beat you, they starved you and they raped you because you were refusing to join them. Is that right? TRANSLATION: Yes. I spent three years with Al-Shabab. I bore them three children. I was taken into battle with them. I escaped when I was wounded in an ambush. She is safe here now but not outside. Al-Shabab may not control much territory but it still has the power to push this fragile nation off course. Andrew Harding, BBC News, Somalia. Cricket And in a gripping finish at Lord’s, England beat New Zealand in the first Test of the series. The visitors were left chasing an England lead of 344 but were bowled out with fewer than ten overs remaining. joe Wilson was there. Thank you very much. So how far did interest in English cricket stretch? Well, all the way down one side of Lord’s, round the corner and right back to St john’s Wood tube station went the queue for £20 tickets, tempted by the scent of English victory. Well if this was people’s Monday, the team responded. New Zealand needed 345 to win. They lost two wickets without a run on the board. Stuart Broad on a hot streak. Another LBW, 12-3, England stopped but only for lunch. Behind the scenes, activity. Director Andrew Strauss settled on an Australian called Trevor Bayliss as first choice for new coach. Here the job has been done by Paul Farbre. His tactic is clear. just unleash Ben Stokes. Stokes got rid of danger man Kane Williamson. You’ll see how significant his teammates thought that was. It got better. Very next ball. New Zealand captain McCullum bowled. Well, stunning from Stokes but then New Zealand resisited and England emerged from the pavilion after the tea interval still needing five wickets. lI.lI5pm, debutant fast bowler Mark Wood, Watling could not get out of the way. 24 overs left, why was the captain giving joe Root the ball? Well, maybe for this? Anderson, LBW. Three more to take. Back came Stokes. Say no more. The bowler who hadn’t contributed was Moeen Ali. His turn now. Southey, gone for 20. That was a good catch. No, this is a good catch. 220 all out. Earlier this month, the talk of Lords was all Peterson. Now it could be team. One to 11, the guys have done well this week. It’s been a rocky road for us. I’ve never heard Lords sounding like that and when Ben got two wickets, at Lord’s, we said this was just amazing and it was. An incredible day. If it can possibly match this one, the second test starts on Friday. Football, and Chelsea have celebrated winning the Premier League with a victory parade. They finished the season eight points clear at the top of the table. Thousands of fans turned out to cheer the team as they travelled on Meanwhile, Norwich City have returned to the Premier League afterjust one season away. They beat Middlesbrough 2-0 in the Championship play-off final at Wembley this afternoon to win one of the most lucrative games in football, as David Ornstein reports. Wembley is well accustomed to big occasions. But they rarely carry such financial implications. The fans arrived in their thousands, hoping to see their team leave with the millions. £120 million in fact - the prize for reaching the Premier League. That is before a massive new TV deal kicks in next year. It made for a buzz in the stands and on the pitch. Norwich were first to take aim, Middlesbrough responding in kind. Anything you can do... Boro’s defence, so reliable all season, malfunctioned when it mattered most. Cameronjerome the grateful recipient. When Nathan Redmond made it two, Norwich had one foot in the top flight. Delia knew it and Middlesbrough too. A couple of half chances came and went and, with it, Boro’s hopes of hitting the jackpot. The footballing and financial riches belonged to Norwich, their relegation this time last year a distant memory. Norwich bounced back at the first time of asking and what a time to do it! They can look forward to facing the likes of Chelsea and Manchester United once again, not to mention that cash windfall. Finally, thousands of people gathered on the banks of the River Mersey in Liverpool this morning to watch three cruise liners mark the 175th anniversary of the founding of the Cunard shipping line. The Queen Mary II, the Queen Victoria and the Queen Elizabeth sailed into port together and were joined by the RAF’s Red Arrows flight team streaming their trademark red, white and blue smoke.

I’m Alice Bhandhukravi. An investigation at Homerton Hospital in east London has found that nurses lost track of a patient who subsequently died in the bathroom. Allan Hawdon was found in the lavatory three hours after he went missing and only after his partner forced staff to open the door. She says she’s determined to make the hospital change the way it works as Emma North reports. Allan Hawdon and his partner had been a couple for more than a quarter of a century. We were together all of the time. We weren’t insulated but we were together all the time. He was admitted to hospital after covering up blood. When she came to see him come his bed was empty. He bled to death in the toilet. I rushed in and he was sideways and it was obvious that he was dead but I didn’t think of that at the time. I tried to breathe into his mouth and talk to him. That was probably only a few seconds but it seemed a long time. The hospital said the death was inevitable but denied they hadn’t taken his case seriously enough. They did admit the search could have been more thorough. I don’t know how long he was dead in there. I don’t know if he died in pain. All I know is he died in that toilet on his own. A report shows the hospital had failed in its care. Homerton Hospital says since Alan’s death it has introduced a rapid response system and from july, it will record conditions electronically, which it says should speed up staff response times. They have said they are happy to meet Susan to talk about their action plan. If I knew they would improve and it wouldn’t happen to anyone else, I would also like more people to complain because so many people don’t because it is so hard. Until things improve, Susan says her life can’t move on. Nearly 10,000 people have signed a petition against the demolition of a row of Victorian buildings on the Strand. King’s College wants to modernise the properties that there is concern over the plans, and the couege is concern over the plans, and the college says it is in discussion with Westminster council. Chelsea fans have been celebrating their team finishing top of the Premier League. jose Mourinho’s squad has taken part in a victory parade through West London after the players were crowned champions for the first time in five years. Sarah Harris went to watch. Thousands of fans lined the route as the victory parade made its way from Stamford Bridge to the Kings Road. It has been a golden return for the Special One, jose Mourinho. As far as Chelsea fans are concerned, he can do no wrong. The best manager this club has ever had and I hope he stays for another 20 years. jose Mourinho! Drogba has come back and lifted the players up and now he is going after winning the season.

120,BBC1 London,31-may-2015,BBC Weekend News,22:00,20 mins,True,"British banks begin to investigate whether they might have handled any corrupt FIFA payments - after being named by the FBI. In Switzerland, Sepp Blatter’s daughter says he is not worried about being questioned in connection with the charges and defends his reputation. He’s not a person who is taking money. All the money he earnt, heerned it by works and he is a hard-working President. Tonight, reports from South Africa that officials did make a $10 million payment before the World Cup there, but deny the money was a bribe. Also on the programme: The fighting in eastern Ukraine and the diplomatic war- the Kremlin bans nine high-profile Britons from travelling to Russia.

New Zealand take control in the Second Test against England at Headingly. Good evening. British banks have begun reviewing transactions involving football’s governing body Fifa after being named in the FBI indictment against several of its officials. Barclays, Standard Chartered and HSBC are believed to be looking back at payments cleared through their branches. In Switzerland, Fifa’s newly re-elected president Sepp Blatter has been defended by his daughter Corinne. In a BBC interview she has insisted he has never taken bribes. For now, Sepp Blatter fights on. Despite the biggest crisis in Fifa’s history, he confounded his critics by winning the presidential election and insists only he can restore trust in football’s world governing body. He is also happy that everything is gone and it’s finished. Speaking exclusively to the BBC, Corinne Blatter, the Fifa leader’s only daughter, and a close confidant, believes last week’s events are the work of those plotting, ultimately, to oust her father. Does he really think this is a conspiracy between Britain and America? I wouldn’t say from the Americans and the British, but certainly people working behind the scenes, yes, absolutely. Dark forces? I don’t know if you want to call them dark forces. They really tried hard. Everything started last year. September, October, everything started already then. They tried, a lot. Following last week’s a dawn raids, US prosecutors say one of the many allegations concern is a $10 million bribe, wired from a Fifa account to help secure the 2010 South African World Cup. Sepp Blatter has denied any involvement in that. And his daughter insists that he is not corrupt. Nobody is without any fault. But the things he has done, so far, he is not a person, and I would really like to say that, he is not a person who is taking money. All the money he earned, he earned it by working. And he is a hard-working president. His character is not like that. He is not taking any money. Is he concerned about being arrested? No. We talked about that this morning, no, he’s not concerned about that. If law enforcement agencies do want him to cooperate, do want to question him, will he say yes to that? I don’t know, you’ll have to ask him that. 73 football associations voted against Sepp Blatter. With his mandate renewed for another four years, his family believe his legacy now depends on healing a divided sport. In South Africa, there are reports that officials have admitted they did pay out $10 million in 2008, as claimed by the US authorities. South Africa held the World Cup in 2010, but the tournament organiser, Dannyjordan, has been quoted as saying that the payment was for football development, not a bribe. Here we learned today about the action being taken by banks in the wake of the FBI indictment. Our Business Correspondentjoe Lynam is here. Which banks are we talking about? Barclays, HSBC and standard charter were named in the indictment by the FBI last week. They did not accuse them of any wrongdoing. Merely their accounts and networks were used to facilitate what the FBI believe to be illicit payments. There are internal reviews we know at Barclays and Standard Chartered and at HSBC. They are looking for red flags. Payments with I might have looked innocent 20 years ago might now look more suspicious. It is not a surprise they are digging through old transfers. Standard Chartered and HSBC have paid billions of fines to US regulators for not properly monitoring the flow of cash through their accounts and they are on a probation list with the Americans. They do not want to aggravate the Americans any further. As for the banks, Barclays and HSBC are staying little. Standard Chartered are looking into the payments but will not comment any further. Thank you. The European Union has strongly criticised a decision by Russia to ban 89 European politicians, officials and military leaders from travelling to the country. An EU spokesman said the list was ""totally arbitrary and unjustified"". Ukraine today. And renewed fighting in a dismalconflict, that nothing seems able to stop, including EU sanctions which have seen a travel ban imposed on over 150 high-ranking Russians. Now, the Russians have retaliated, saying in effect, you ban ours and we will ban yours. Britain is on the list, include Nick Clegg General Sir Nicholas Houghton, Sirjohn Sawers, the former head of MI6 and Sir Malcolm Rifkind. The Russian blacklist has left many bemused like this former Bulgarian ambassador to Moscow. I was surprised because the company is quite distinguished. And I was humbled by the presence of Vice-Presidents, ministers for foreign affairs. And this Belgium politician. Should I be flattered? Did Mr Putin really notice my work? Me as a simple Flemish MEP. He did. The Kremlin has not published the names of those it has banned and accuses the West of leaking them to make a purely political point. Here at the Foreign Office in London they say there’s nojustification at the Foreign Office in London they say there’s no justification for this list and if Russia thinks this is the way to get the EU to change its mind on sanctions, then it is wrong. The way to get the sanctions lifted, they say, is for Russia to take its troops out of Ukraine. Most on the list have been openly critical of Russia’s involvement in Ukraine, including this former UK Defence Minister. I think it is rather depressing that Russia is resorting to the Soviet era, tit-for-tat expulsions as they used to be 1+0 years ago. They should concentrate on implementing peace to eastern Ukraine. Meanwhile, as Russia and the EU engage in their tit-for-tat world of words the war goes on. US Senators are currently debating whether to extend tough surveillance laws due to expire in the next few hours. These are live pictures of the rare weekend sitting in Washington DC. If the House decides to take no action, the National Security Agency will be forced to stop collecting telephone data of American citizens. President Obama has made a last-ditch plea to Congress saying it would be ""irresponsible"" and ""reckless"" to allow the legislation to expire. Our North America Editor, jon Sopel, joins us now. Well, we have been here before, haven’t we? There have been battles in the past over getting various budgets past and whether bits of Government will be shut down. But not on national security. National security has not been taken to the brink like this. Essentially, as you say, if this legislation is not renewed by midnight, then the servers concerning the bulk collection of mobile phone data will have to be shut down. They will have to stop the roving wiretaps on terror suspects. They will not be able to track so-called lone wolves, who the United States fear. Barack Obama says we must not surremeder tools that are useful in the fight. The fight is being led by a republican libtarian senator who is also a Presidential hopeful. If you are a Presidential hopeful, one of the things you need is publicity and lots of it and he is getting it by the bucket load, as a result of the stand that he is taking tonight. Thank you very much. Our North America editor. The English Premier League club Leicester City has launched an internal investigation after a Thai woman was racially abused and insulted during a filmed group sexual encounter with three of its players in Thailand - the homeland of the club’s owner. One of the players involved isjames Pearson, the son of team manager Nigel Pearson, who’s a prominent anti-racism campaigner. The chief executive of NHS England - Simon Stevens - has said the health service needs to clamp down on some nursing agencies, accusing them of ""ripping off the NHS"". Last year the service spent more than twice the amount on contract and agency staff. They play an essential role on the front line of the NHS. But hospitals are increasingly relying on temporary or agency nurses to fill shifts. And it is costing the cash strapped service millions of pounds. You are getting nurses... The head of NHS England says the problem must be tackled. One of the things we have to do is ensure that NHS hospitals are offering flexible employment for these nurses who are currently working in these temporary agencies, but also we will have to clamp down on some of these staffing agencies who frankly are ripping off the NHS. After failings in care were revealed in Mid-Staffordshire, hospitals increased the number of nurses on wards. But it takes three years to train a nurse, so temporary staff are plugging the gap. Agencies say the NHS fail to plan its workforce, and far from taking advantage, they provide a vital service. The demand on the NHS is not consistent, it does go through peaks and troughs, and having an agency to provide services at the last minute allows the NHS in a way to save money, because they don’t need to have full resourcing on their wards all the time. But growing dependence on temporary staff is costing a lot. Last year the NHS spent 1.8 billion on agency staff in England, more than double what was planned. The Government says it has recruited more permanent staff, including more than 8,000 extra nurses since 2010. But unions say more must be done. First of all, more flexible working for the nurses who have got childcare responsibilities, and cannot work rigid shift systems. Secondly, increase the number of student nurses in training and you will go a long way to Attempts are ongoing to recruit and train more nurses, which should solve this in the long term. In the short-term, it is piling pressure on a service already facing increased demand and stretched budgets. The Department of Health says the NHS does need to spend less on agency staff, and use funds more effectively. Last year, the overspend on temporary staff would have accounted for the entire deficit for all NHS Trusts in England. Whether negotiating new agency rates, or improving workforce planning, NHS England has promised collective action. Thousands of families in Iraq are trapped by fighting between Islamic State extremists and government forces. Human rights groups have accused the government of failing to help many of those trying to flee from areas such as Anbar province where IS recently seized the key city of Ramadi. From Anbar, Orla Guerin reports. Advancing on Islamic State in Anbar province. Fighters from a Shia militia on the front line in recent days. They may be a bigger threat to IS than the Iraqi Army. For those trying to flee the insurgents, this bridge over the Euphrates is a key escape route from Anbar - or it should be. Now there is more commercial traffic getting in than desperate civilians getting out. But this man and his family have just managed to leave Fallujah, after pleading with IS for two months. TRANSLATION: I begged them. I gave them medical reports to prove I need surgery. On the way out, we had to hide from air strikes, and walk for nine hours in the desert. A Tent City across the river is as far as many of Anbar’s Sunni Muslims can get because the Shia-led Government is limiting access to Baghdad. This is where many of those who fled from Islamic State are stranded. Some have already been here for two months, and the conditions are grim. They are at the mercy of punishing heat. Families here say they are getting little or no help, and they feel they have been abandoned by their Government. Many, like Mohammed, are running on empty. He is worried for his heavily pregnant wife and four children. So worried he is thinking of fleeing again, back to Islamic State. TRANSLATION: If this situation continues, with high temperatures and no services, all of us will go back. Most went already, because we have nothing here. For now, more than 200 families remain here. Victims of Islamic State, and Iraqi bureaucracy. Time now for some sport. Let’sjoin Olly Foster. England are up against it in the Second Test at Headingley. New Zealand currently lead by 338 runs with four wickets in hand. There are two days left to play, and no England Test side has successfully chased a target that big for victory. Patrick Gearey reports. A day away from summer. In Leeds it felt much further. Weather to huddle and plots trubl. In came Tim Southee and sent in batsmen to the warmth of the pavilion. Three went in half an hour. Catching practise for cold hands. The bat of broad Broad, he careered to 1+6 and hauled England up to 350 all out. Exactly New Zealand’s score. The tourists were straight back out to bat. Important to keep your body lose, but not your shots. Tom Latham fund out. Broad nipped out Williamson too. The game was in England’s grasp. For a moment it slipped out. Gary Ballance dropped Guptill, just as the skies began to clear. Fewer clouds tend to mean fewer problems for batsmen. Guptill and Taylor made runs while the sun shown and fast. In an hour-- shone and in an hour fast. They handed over to new tormentors. Lifting New Zealand’s lead from a precarious one to something more muscular. McCullum went, but Watling remained. By too time he went to 100 his team had 300. A commanding lead. Cook knows how tough it is to get that many batting at Headingley. Police Scotland are going to investigate a fight between players at the end of Motherwell’s match against Rangers today. Goals from the second leg of their Premiership play-off final will be on Sportscene after the News in Scotland but I’ve go the details of the match now, if you want them.... Rangers will still be in the Championship next season after losing 6-1 on aggregate. Motherwell made sure that they stay in the Premiership with a 3-nil win at Fir Park....their first goal from Lee Erwi’s strike took a freakish deflection. Erwin pushed Ranger’s Bilel Mowsni at the final whistle, he reacted by kicking and punching Erwin - a mass brawl ensued. Police Scotland say they will conduct a full review of the circumstance. There were much happier scenes as Inverness Caledonian Thistle showed off the Scottish Cup in the city. They beat Falkirk 2-1 at Hampden yesterday to secure their first major trophy.

123,BBC1 London,27-may-2015,BBC News at One,13:00,40 mins,True,"Fifa in crisis - seven senior officials have been arrested in dawn raids at a luxury hotel in Switzerland. For Fifa, this is good. It confirms that we are on the right track. It hurts, it is not easy, but it is the only way to go. This is a very serious way for Fifa and the leadership of Fifa.

Later on BBC London: Why motorbike thieves deliberately take their helmets off to avoid being chased by the police. And cheek byjowell - how one mayoral candidate took on suspected slum landlords. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. Football’s world governing body has been plunged into crisis, becoming the subject of two corruption investigations. Seven top Fifa officials have been arrested in a dawn raid in Switzerland, on suspicion of accepting £97 million in bribes. The suspects now face extradition to the United States. Meanwhile, Swiss prosecutors have announced their own criminal investigation relating to the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Fifa has welcomed the inquiry, saying it’s a ""good day in terms of cleaning up"". Richard Conway sent this report from Zurich. This was the hotel wake-up call no one at Fifa expected. Seven officials arrested during a dawn raid. The charges relate to millions of US dollars in bribes paid over the course of two decades. The organisation’s vice president was among those taken by police, but Fifa incest the arrests and a separate Swiss probe into how World Cups were allocated would be to their benefit. This four Fifa is good. It is not good in terms of image or reputation, but in terms of cleaning up, in terms of everything what we did and asked for, in terms of the process, this is good. And these are four of the men arrested this morning. jeffrey Webb, Eduardo Lee, jose Maria Marin. Fifa has been set by accusations of corruption. Up until now, it has managed to keep its dirty laundry behind closed doors. Executives either left or simply resigned without a stain on their character. Today’s arrests changed all that, and US investigators insist this is far from the end of their enquiries. This is a serious day Fifa and the leadership of Fifa. And we would certainly vote for somebody to stand against Sepp Blatter if the election goes ahead. The timing comes as the officials arrived in Zurich four Fifa’s annual conference. Sepp Blatter faces a challenge from Prince Ali ofjordan. Election calculations of an easy win for the incumbent have been thrown into doubt. Events at the top of world football often seem far removed from the cut and thrust of normal life, but many feel a tipping point may now have been reached. I don’t know if people are guilty of corruption or not. If people are guilty of corruption, of course you want action to be taken. Fifa insist it is business as usual, but with leading executives now facing extradition to the United States, football is facing up to yet more scandal at the top of the game. Our sports editor Dan Roan is in Zurich for us now. Down, your assessment of the seriousness of this. The husband so much scandal, it is easy to become almost numb from the latest controversy. But even by Fifa’s tainted standards, this feels like a big deal. This morning, you saw with those dramatic pictures, this hotel offered no sanction. This is not an internal enquiry, it involves very serious law enforcement agencies here, and in Switzerland. The indictment was brought because of alleged corruption that was deep, long-standing and rampant, and there could be further action to follow. This is a crackdown, the like of which hasn’t been seen before. On Friday is meant to be the presidential election, seen very much as a formality, or at least it was until this morning. Now there is confusion over that process, with growing calls for it to be postponed. There will be calls from the football public and from sponsors as well perhaps for there to be another vote of the World Cups awarded to Russia in 2018 and Qatar in 2022. This could be a game changer that has wide-ranging ramifications for the sport. And we can speak to our correspondent in New York, Nick Bryant. What are the authorities saying there? jane, I am struck by the strength of the language they are using, saying this indictment alleges corruption that is systemic, rampant and deep-rooted. Enough is enough, the US authorities are saying, after decades of what this indictment alleges to be brazen corruption, and organised international soccer needs a fresh start. That is a powerful and loaded statement on the eve of the election which will determine the next resident of Fifa. These are the words of the US attorney here in Brooklyn, one of the most aggressive prosecutors anywhere. This indictment is not the final chapter of our investigation stop it is not just what is being said, it is who is saying it. It is the new Attorney General of the United States. It is the head of the FBI. America has devoted its biggest criminal investigation firepower to try and investigate this wrongdoing. And give us a sense of how we have reached this point, as well, and got to these arrests. A lot seems to have come from a man called Chuck Blazer, one of the great power brokers of football, a Fifa official and head of the North America and Central America and Caribbean Federation. He was flipped, that is the FBI got him to become a cooperating witness. He also became part of their investigation. They gave him a key ring fitted with a microphone, and he will organise meetings and put this key ring on the table and record what was going on. It is understood that a lot of those recordings are what will feature if this case does come to court. Nick Bryant, thank you. The Queen has opened the first session of the new parliament, outlining the legislation that the Conservative government wants to pass this year. The speech in the House of Lords contained 26 bills, including an EU referendum by the end of 2017, more free childcare, an income tax freeze, and the right to buy for housing association tenants. However, proposals for a British Bill of Rights to replace the Human Rights Act have been deferred to allow time for consultation. Our political correspondent Carole Walker reports. It isa It is a ceremony which has changed little over the decades. But today’s Queen’s Speech heralds some far reaching changes to the way our country is run. This is Her Majesty’s 62nd Queen’s Speech. The first for almost 20 years of a majority Conservative government. The door of the Commons is slammed in the face of the messenger, known as Black Rod. It demonstrates the supremacy of the Commons. Before he is allowed in to summon MPs. There is always tension between government and opposition, but the Prime Minister and acting leader of the opposition had all the appearance of a row in couple forced to accompany one another to the big occasion. The Queen set out the Government’s key measures and themes. It will adopt a I nation approach, helping working people get on, supporting aspiration, giving opportunities to the disadvantaged and bringing different parts of our country together. The government has already begun negotiations to win back powers from Brussels, and the bill to give the public a say in whether or not we stay in the EU was central. My government will pursue reform of the European Union for the benefit of all member states. Alongside this, legislation will be introduced to provide for an in-out referendum on membership of the European Union before the end of 2017. Controversial plans to replace the Human Rights Act with a British Bill of Rights have been deferred to allow for consultation. My government will bring forward proposals for a British Bill of Rights. Her Majesty outlined heavy proposal of legislation, more than 20 bills, including some proposals which the Conservatives were unable to deliver when they were in coalition. Boosting the economy and creating 2 million more newjobs was tackling the deficit remains the big priority. If you look at the key bills, employment, welfare, childcare, it is about supporting people getting back into work. The Prime Minister has made it very clear that we are the party for working people. That is the real bread and butter, and those are the issues that matter to the public. Other measures in the Queen’s Speech would have included a guarantee of no rises in income tax rates, VAT or national insurance. The childcare bill to double the amount of free childcare for working parents to 30 hours a week. And an Immigration Bill to crackdown on illegal workers and sees the wages paid to illegal migrants. So, the speech delivered by the Queen is that of a Prime Minister seizing his best opportunity to press ahead with highly contentious measures whilst he has the momentum of his election victory, and most of his opponents are still recovering from defeat. But he will still face some real battles to get all his plans through Parliament. We will look to hold the government to account for what they do on the economy, which is still fragile, how they evolve the constitutional change which needs to happen, but needs to be in a way which is not divisive, and above all, how they protect public services. The ceremonial of the day is completed, the focus now on political arguments. The Prime Minister has to keep his own party onside if he’s to get is proposals with a slim majority. But he will argue that he has a mandate to put his plans into practice. Carole Walker, BBC News, Westminster. Our political editor Norman Smith is here. What struck you about what you heard this morning? The scale of the Queen’s Speech and the pace with which Mr Cameron clearly wants to press ahead, including with the EU referendum Bill. This fuels the possibility that maybe Mr Cameron is edging towards holding a referendum next year, and all that on top of more than 20 other bills. It is the legislative equivalent of a full gift wrap for, where Mr Cameron has put everything on the plate. -- gift wrap for, where Mr Cameron has put everything on the plate. -- full English breakfast. And why? Because Mr Clegg isn’t there to curtail him. And the opposition are flat on their backs, now is his moment of maximum opportunity. One further thought, backs, now is his moment of maximum opportunity. One furtherthought, he does not want this to be a Government purely defined by deficit reduction, he wants another story, and the story he wants is that this is the government of working people, so there are a lot of bills around immigration, housing, childcare, the NHS, issues which he believes are bread and butter and will play to that story of a party for working people. Well he has had to drop the idea of British bill of rights. David Cameron has got to tread carefully because he isjust a tiny Cameron has got to tread carefully because he is just a tiny majority. Some Tory MPs do not like certain agenda items and that could revoke problems. And in the House of Lords the Conservatives are outnumbered three to one. Peers may cause trouble over issues on the constitution. And then there are the Scottish National Party MPs, with the former First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond saying this morning that he would be a thorn in David Cameron was a Mac side. David Cameron may have a majority will have to tread very carefully. -- David Cameron was Iraq side. The SNP says measures set out in the Queen’s Speech to transfer more powers from Westminster to the Edinburgh parliament don’t go far enough. The proposals are based on the findings of the Smith Commission, set up after the Scots rejected independence last year. Well a new MP joanna Well a new MPjoanna Cherry that their success in the election needs to be reflected. We are looking to this government to deliver on the spirit and letter of the Smith Commission and also on further powers for the Scottish Parliament, real powers in recognition of the outcome of the general election in Scotland. And Lorna Gordon is here. Are they going to get that? There is a big blob of Bezy -- to get that? There is a big blob of Bezy -- SNP MP is done in Westminster. The question is will they have any real power. They would like the powers that will be set out probably in the Scotland Bill expected to be published tomorrow go further than was detailed in the draft legislation. That talked about the share of VAT coming to Scotland, control over income tax bands and rates. Air Passenger Duty. The SNP would like to see areas like employment law and minimum wage being devolved further. So there will be areas of conflict ahead. And this legislation is another area which will be pushed forward quickly. We expect it to become law by February. So there will be a lot of noise, challenges to table amendments, and the Prime Ministers says he will listen carefully to what he calls any sensible suggestions for changes going forward. A contentious plan to replace the Human Rights Act with a British Bill of Rights was limited to a promise of proposals rather than legislation. This is partly because the Conservative party is divided on the issue, but there are also concerns about whether the change would be supported by the devolved administrations. Our legal correspondent Clive Coleman reports. In the aftermath of the atrocities of the Second World War, the UK and others signed up to European Convention on Human Rights. Inspired by Churchill’s desire to enthrone the rights that had been so abused in the conflict. In 1998 Tony Blair’s Labour government incorporated the convention into our law, in the form of the Human Rights Act. It is much admired, with supporters pointing for example to the independent enquiry into appalling standards of care at Stafford Hospital. Which came about as the result of a Human Rights Act challenge. But critics blame it for allowing terror suspects like Abu Qatada and some foreign criminals to fight removal from the UK. And say that the European Court of Human Rights whose judgements must be taken into account, has gone too far. Most famously declaring that the UK’s blanket ban on prisoners voting was unlawful. That led to the Conservatives pledging to scrap the Human Rights Act. And introduce a British Bill of Rights, breaking the formal link with Strasberg. Expectations were raised, but today, this. My government will bring forward proposals for a British Bill of Rights. just proposals. Why has the government delayed its British Bill of Rights? You cannot enact a Bill of Rights for Britain without talking to the rest of Britain outside England. And it seems clear now that the rest of Britain doesn’t want this. But also the Human Rights Act is not doing the damage they say and have been saying for years it has been doing. But this leading barrister who served on the coalition government’s commission to draft a British Bill of Rights which still has not been published, said change is needed. We also need to balance rights with responsibilities. That needs to be revisited. We also need to deal with the perception that human rights are the refuge of the undeserving. But with a wafer thin majority and bigger political issues like an EU referendum to deal with, it may be some time before we see a British Bill of Rights. Let’s have a closer look at some of the measures announced in the Queen’s speech. Here’s our Personal Finance Correspondent, Simon Gompertz. What stood out for you? First that promise not to increase the main rate of tax. Income tax, national insurance and VAT. So the government boxing itself in full stop significant promise for families but that does not mean they cannot increase the tax they take in other ways. There is another measure coming in higher earners lose some of their pension tax rates. The £12,500 personal allowance, the amount you can earn before paying income tax, probably to come in gradually during the term of this government but would eventually be worth £380 per year for a government but would eventually be worth £380 per yearfor a basic worth £380 per year for a basic rate taxpayer. And the minimum wage is this promised to say that no one would have to pay tax, income tax again, if they work 30 hours on minimum wage. They already do not have to pay tax because of that. So it does not affect people at the moment but during the term of the government it will be significant. They may have two pay national insurance. Childcare is also important and you can get 15 hours of free childcare per child at the moment, going up to 30 hours. It starts from 2017 and is worth around £5,000 per child. It is in addition to getting any top-up childcare tax free. And there were also promises in relation to housing. The right to buy and we have seen many council homes purchased under right to buy. This is extending to housing associations. But you have to have lived there and paid rent for three years. The discount you can get is almost £70,000. Over £100,000 in London. So it will be a major benefit if you’re in a housing association home. And just to tell you about the benefit cuts side of this, it is not all giveaways. A couple of things that were promised, a £22,000 cap on the amount of benefit a household can get them down from £26,000. And the housing benefit restriction for those aged under 21, they will not automatically be able to get housing benefit. And from next year there will be a freeze on working age benefits, Thomasjoined will be a freeze on working age benefits, Thomas joined the campaign by the Tories. So that will affect child benefit for example which will not go up under that freeze. So we will hear a lot more about those benefit restrictions in the budget in july. Our top story this lunchtime. Fifa in crisis - football’s world governing body faces twin corruption probes. And still to come. An emergency plan to cope with the influx of migrants into Europe. Coming up in sport. We’ll hear from the ECB who yesterday appointed the Australian Trevor Bayliss as England cricket head coach. They’ve held a news conference and we’ll have the latest for you. Scientists say a genetically-engineered version of a virus that causes cold sores shows real promise for treating skin cancer. Research has found that when the therapy, called T-VEC, was injected into tumours it could halt their growth, or even eradicate them. It’s the first study to prove an increase in survival using the drug - although it only worked for some melanoma patients. Here’s our Health Correspondent jane Dreaper. It isa It is a common cancer and can be deadly. Melanoma kills more than 2000 people in the UK every year. Scientists are excited that this landmark trial has shown a new way of helping some patients survive. So how does the treatment work? A version of the herpes virus that causes the common cold sore is the key to this treatment. The virus has been genetically modified so when it is injected into a patient, it is harmless to healthy cells but attacks and kills the cancerous ones. The herpes virus has been redefined to make it attractive to the immune system so that cancer tumours in other parts of the body come under attack as well. The study of more than 400 patients with inoperable melanoma is the biggest of its kind. And while it was not effective for everyone, one in ten patients so the tumour destroyed. While others saw their life expectancy extended by years. The new treatment called T-VEC has not yet been licensed for general use by doctors at the researchers hope that will happen soon. This trial reported today represents ten years of work but we already have submitted the data package to the regulatory authorities in America and in Europe and we expect a favourable opinion that the drug could be available for treating patients within a year. There are still questions about which patients will benefit. And whether other drugs need to be taken at the same time. But skin cancer charities said that the promise of extra years of life for some late stage of the disease gives new hope. The first criminal trial linked to the rigging of a key interest rate is continuing. Tom Hayes a former City trader is accused of acting in a ‘thoroughly dishonest manner’ in his alleged attempts to rig the so-called Libor rate. Emma Simpson is at Southwark Crown Court. What has the court been hearing? The prosecution this morning has been showing the jury a series of e-mails and snippets of electronic chat which they claim clearly highlights the manipulation of Libor and the breadth of conspiracy that took days to wreck this key benchmark rate. In one of them Tom Hayes is allegedly discussing manipulating Libor with another trader at RBS, saying, three-month Libor is too high, I kept it artificially high. How, said the trader. Tom Hayes replied, being mates with the cash desk. We always help each other out. The prosecution said if you ever needed any evidence of deliberate rigging of rates, this is it. A short time ago the jury was also played a short telephone conversation between Tom Hayes and his stepbrother who recently had joined HSBC. In the chat Tom Hayes can be heard asking him, if he could do a favour by asking the person who submitted the Libor rate to keep it on the low side for a few days to benefit his trading. Tom Hayes denies all eight charges of conspiracy to defraud. The European Commission has been outlining plans to deal with the influx of migrants from Africa and the Middle East. A quota system is proposed to spread 40,000 asylum seekers across all EU countries over the next two years. Several countries - including Britain - have said they’re unhappy with the plan. Our Europe Correspondent Damian Grammaticas is in Brussels. Explain a bit more about what is proposed. There are several planks to this. The first deals with that surge of boat people, their rivals who have already made it and will make it to Italy and Greece. That is this 40,000 number, to be taken and spread across other countries. They will be Syrians and Eritreans, other countries will be free to decide on those applicants whether they are genuine asylum seekers and take them or not. And on that quota and on those numbers, the UK says it is opting out, it does not want to be part of that. On the 20,000 people from outside, this is to tackle the flows moving towards Europe, the European Union wants countries to take their share of 20,000. The UK is being asked to take a share but thatis is being asked to take a share but that is voluntary. And the final thing they’re talking about is trying to disrupt the flow by retaining many of the people who come, who are not genuine refugees or asylum seekers. At the minute many are not sent back. It wants to step up ways of doing that and disrupt the smuggling networks. But evenif disrupt the smuggling networks. But even if all these plans are accepted by EU countries, which is not yet clear, many have voiced doubts about it, it is only a tiny proportion of those arriving in Italy and Greece. And they will deal with the vast majority. You are watching the BBC News at one. Ourtop You are watching the BBC News at one. Our top story: one. Ourtop story: Seven high-ranking officials from high- ranking officials from football’s high-ranking officials from football’s world governing body, Fifa, are arrested as the organisation faces two corruption investigations. Coming up, we will have the weather prospects, plus the news where you are, but first let’s catch up with all of the sports news. We start with cricket and England batsman joe Root is looking forward to working with the new head coach Trevor Bayliss later this summer. Root says the experience that Bayliss - who is Australian - has of their opponents in the Ashes this summer will help England. Nine of the squad he has worked with before, so that will be a slight advantage. More than anything, it is pleasing to see and be able to get the chance with someone who has been said experienced in international cricket and domestic cricket. To rugby union and a huge blow for Wales with centre jonathan Davies ruled out of the Rugby World Cup with a knee injury. Davies ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament playing for French club Clermont Auvergne on Saturday. Davies has been first choice in Wales’ midfield alongside jamie Roberts. The British and Irish Lion will have surgery in the next few days, he’s expected to be out of action for six to seven months. And as far as England’s campaign goes, World Cup winner Matt Dawson says Dylan Hartley’s indiscipline could cost them at this year’s tournament. The Northampton hooker faces a disciplinary panel later today after being charged with head-butting Saracens forward jamie George in Saturday’s Premiership semi-final. The defending French Open tennis champion Maria Sharapova is safely through to the third round at Roland Garros. The number two seed beat fellow Russian Vitalia Diatchenko in straight sets 6-3, 6-1. Sharapova’s looking to win the French Open title for the third time in her career. She’ll play the American Sam Stosur next. Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe says he was surprised to beat Chelsea boss jose Mourinho to the LMA Manager of the Year award. Howe’s Bournemouth won the Championship title to secure promotion to the Premier League this season. The award’s voted for by managers from across the leagues. During his two spells in charge of the club they’ve gone from football league survival, all the way to the top flight. Arsenal’s Danny Welbeck has been ruled out of this weekend’s cup final. His manager says that bone bruising in his knee has not healed. And Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has written an open letter to the club’s fans, thanking them for their support, and promising he’ll be back at Anfield in a couple of years. In the Liverpool Echo newspaper, he said ""I want to keep playing every week in the final few years of my career and I’m looking forward to embarking on a new challenge with Los Angeles Galaxy in the MLS. I’ll be away for the next couple of years but this isn’t the end of my long association with Liverpool FC. I’ve been a supporter all my life, and that will continue. That’s all sport for now. Back to you. Will, thank you very much. At least 17 people have been killed, and dozens injured, in the American states of Oklahoma and Texas, after record rainfall. The storms caused widespread damage to homes, and stranded hundreds of motorists. Parts of Houston remain underwater- and more heavy rain is expected over the next few days. Aleem Maqbool reports. A state of emergency has been announced here. Days of relentless rain suddenly intensified, causing massive flash flooding. Some have even been swept to their deaths. Like 18-year-old Alyssa, who was driving home from her school prom when her car was taken by the waters. Oh, my God! Across large areas, people struggled against the weather. The driver of this vehicle escaped unharmed, but others, like this woman and her children, are now missing. She called me and said, ""I am in a house, I am floating down the river. Tell mom and dad I love you, and pray."" After years of drought, parts of Texas and Oklahoma are now under water. The people did notjust have to contend with excessive rainfall, but powerful tornadoes as well. I just thought it was the wind real hard to start with. I was watching TV and itjust hit. It blew the windows out. It blew the roof off and it actually picked the house up and moved it over about four foot. You can see some of the trees that are this big around, just ripped, just twisted and broken, like a toothpick. It is incredible. The extreme weather may have subsided for now, but, for many, the losses have already heavy. More than 1,100 people have now died in India’s major heatwave, and forecasters say there is no immediate end in sight. The south of the country has borne the brunt of the hot, dry conditions, with temperatures hitting 50 degrees centigrade. Many of the victims are construction workers, elderly people, or homeless people who are unable to heed official advice to stay indoors. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Tomasz Schafernaker. For many of us it is a case of staying out this afternoon. It really is beautiful. But further north and west, it is starting to change. This area of cloud is going to flood through the country during the course of today, so the weather is going downhill. The jet stream is on top of the UK, and it will drive our weather for a few days. The first spell of rain is over as through this afternoon, but across the south, it is not bad at all. Let’s start with the south-west. Apart from maybe the odd spot of rain a little later, it is fine, and this entire southeastern quadrant of the country stays lovely. 20 Celsius in London, 16 in Birmingham, but then all around the North we have rain on and off throughout the afternoon and into the evening. The wind is picking up, too. Through the course of this evening, further rain crosses Scotland. Then we have showers and a breezy night. In the south, not cold, 10-12 C, but cooler air from the Atlantic affecting the northern part of the country. Tomorrow, a blustery day, particularly in the north and west, but a chance of catching a downpour. For the southern half of the country, the weather is not looking too bad. Cooler, yes, that temperatures still reaching 18 Celsius. But it is disappointing 10 Celsius in Glasgow. On balance, on Friday, a lot fresher than we would normally hope to see in May, cooler, 12 Celsius in Newcastle. If you have any plans for Saturday, makes most of Saturday because it be quite sunny. Briefly high pressure, and then Sunday, not looking too good. We have a big area of low pressure, so to summarise all of that, Saturday is the good day. And on Sunday, wet and windy weather on the way, so the weekend is very much split. The weather is looking pretty changeable for a few days now. Thank you, Tomasz. Nowa reminder of our top story this lunchtime. Football’s world governing body, Fifa, is plunged into crisis, facing two corruption investigations. That’s all from us, now on BBC One it’s time Have a good afternoon. Welcome to BBC London news. I’m Alex Bushill. This programme has learned that suspects riding motorcycles in London have adopted a new tactic to prevent themselves from being caught. We’ve obtained information from the Met which reveals that many criminals now take their helmets off on purpose when riding away from police so that officers in pursuit stop immediately. Charlotte Franks explains. From a helicopter, police in London track an erratic driver on a motorbike. Officers could pursue him by car, too. This rider is in the Midlands, but if he was in London, the chances are police wouldn’t chase him. The reason? He’s not wearing a helmet. We’ve seen an e-mail from the Metropolitan Police which reveals suspects across the capital are taking off their helmets to prevent them from being caught. The Met have told us that they rarely chase anyone without a helmet, because if they fall off, they are likely to die. A Freedom of Information request has revealed that over the last year there have been over 1,200 crimes across the capital where suspects have been riding mopeds or motorbikes at the time. But in an indication of how powerless police staff feel, one revealed in an e-mail that it is ""pretty much impossible to stop"". We have a moral duty and actually a mandate as police officers to protect the public. That includes offenders trying to escape from us. We have to mitigate the risk. So if an offender is not wearing a helmet, that will be factored in. Before the latest policy came into effect, Reece Leon Robinson-Webber died whilst riding a moped in a police chase. He was 15, too young to be riding one, but he was wearing a helmet. His friend on board wasn’t. He was breaking the law, and the police do have a right to initiate a chase if someone is driving. Reece wasn’t driving. They were the reason that Reece got onto the bike, ",,
125,BBC News 24,27-may-2015,BBC News at Six,18:00,30 mins,True,"Tonight, Fifa in turmoil, amid new allegations of rampant and systemic corruption. In dawn raids in Switzerland, seven of world football’s most powerful figures are arrested to face extradition to America. This really is the World Cup of fraud. Today we are issuing Fifa with a red card. And the votes to award the World Cup to Qatar and Russia are probed - Swiss authorities launch a separate criminal investigation. Here at Westminster, the Queen has unveiled the Government’s plans for the coming year at the State Opening of Parliament. It was a day of pageantry and politics - more than 20 bills in the speech with a central pledge to hold a referendum on Britain’s future in the European Union. My government will legislate in the interests of everyone in our country. It will adopt a one-nation approach. There’ll be extra powers for the Scottish Parliament but the Scottish National Party are saying they will press for more. It’s a programme for working people, say ministers, so we’ll be talking to some workers in South Gloucestershire. And the genetically-engineered version of a cold sore virus On BBC London we reveal how thieves on motorbikes deliberately take their helmets off to avoid being chased by police. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. World football’s governing body, Fifa, is in a major crisis tonight, the subject of two criminal investigations. Seven high-ranking Fifa officials were arrested this morning in Switzerland as part of an American investigation into corruption. This afternoon in New York came detailed allegations of bribery, racketeering and money laundering. Meanwhile, criminal proceedings were also launched in Switzerland in connection with Fifa’s decision to award the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar. Our sports editor, Dan Roan, is in Zurich with the very latest for us now. There have been so many scandals over the years, sometimes it is hard to believe what will happen next. Lyric is seen by many as a sanctuary at times -- Lyric is seen by many as a sanctuary at times -- Zurich. That changed earlier on this morning with dramatic scenes, as you will see in this report. It was the wake-up call no one at Fifa had expected. A dawn raid by plainclothes Swiss police at one of Zurich’s most luxurious hotels. Nine current or former senior football officials arrested and now facing extradition to the United States. Among them, vice president jeffrey Webb and disgraced former Fifa power brokerjack Warner. Today’s events were instigated by the FBI, which has been investigating Fifa officials for years. Beginning in 1991, two generations of soccer officials used their positions of trust within respective organisations to solicit bribes from sports marketers in exchange for the commercial rights to their soccer tournaments. They did this over and over, year after year, tournament after tournament. The scale of the alleged corruption is breathtaking. Suspected bribes worth almost £100 million involving South American and US marketing executives over almost a quarter of a century. The conspiracy extending to the decision to award South Africa at the World Cup in 2010 and the Fifa presidential election a year later. This really is the World Cup of fraud and today we are issuing Fifa a red card. The arrests are thought to relate in part to bribes given to former Fifa officials by the now-defunct sports marketing company, the subject of a BBC Panorama programme investigation in 2010. The pressure intensified after a newspaper probe into allegations of corruption of the awarding of World Cups in Russia and Qatar. And in a remarkable twist, it is that controversial decision that is now the subject of more criminal proceedings announced today. This time by the Swiss Federal prosecutors who want to question ten Fifa executives. In a hastily arranged press conference, Fifa work in typically defined mood, somehow putting a positive spin on the day’s events. This fork Fifa is good. Not in terms of image and not in terms of reputation, but in terms of cleaning up in terms of everything that we have done in the last four years, this is good. This comesjust as football last four years, this is good. This comes just as football officials from around the globe gather ahead of Friday’s presidential election. After 17 years in charge, Sepp Blatter was expected to see off his sole rival wins Aly. But that now seems a lot less certain -- sole rival wins Aly. But that now seems a lot less certain -- Prince Ali. It is completely nauseating to be involved in football and suffered this ongoing embarrassment to the game that is the governing body. The election should be suspended for now. Common sense should prevail. But common sense does not always exist in the towers of Fifa. Sepp Blatter arrived this week looking confident. He might not feel quite so assured tonight. It is important to remember it is not an internal inquiry that is easy for Fifa to dismiss. It involves one of the most senior law enforcement agencies in the world, the FBI. Fifa and the sponsors that have made the World Cup such a lucrative product to the governing body will now come under serious pressure to postpone the election. Sepp Blatter will be under pressure to step aside. There will be a degree of pressure for what would be a sensational re-vote of the next two World Cups. Sepp Blatter is one of the greatest survivors. He has ridden out severe storms in the past. It would be no surprise if he did so again. Such is the scale of the allegations are going back years, such is the emphasis placed by the American authorities on the fact it is merely the start, it is hard to escape the fact it could be a game changer for Fifa, its biggest crisis to date. Nick Bryant is in New York. Nick, this is a global organisation. How is it that US prosecutors are at the centre of this story? Today America assumed the role of the global policeman for the global game and this is a sport that is far more central to British and European culture and South American banter American culture. They have brought theirfull American culture. They have brought their full investigative firepower to bear. -- their full investigative firepower to bear. -- than American culture. The US Attorney General, the head of the FBI, the two most senior law enforcement figures in the country. They have brought this because American officials are involved, American companies too. One of them is the president of the leading confederation in America and another is a former head, Chuck Blazer, central to the investigation. He put a hidden microphone in his key ring to make secret recordings. It is the sort of stuff you get on The Wire. It is the sort of stuff normally levelled against mobsters. Thank you. Now with news of the Queen’s Speech, let’s go to Huw Edwards at Westminster. Thank you very much. A very eventful day. The Queen outlined a long list of proposed new legislation during the State Opening of Parliament. It is the first exclusively Conservative programme for nearly 20 years. The Prime Minister described it as a programme for working people, a programme to unite the country. There was confirmation of a referendum on Britain’s future in the European Union, provisions to extend free childcare and to take more low- paid workers out of tax. But controversial plans to replace the Human Rights Act have been delayed, as our political editor Nick Robinson reports. Appearances Appâ8Iâ8I’ICâS CBFI iJâ Appearances can be deceptive. It may be Her Majesty that travels from the palace to Parliament to deliver it, accompanied by the finery, but the reality is much more simple. This is the Prime Minister’s speech and one that David Cameron thought he might never get to make. Is life easier without the Lib Dems? Of course it is. He has a Tory majority so in theory he can do what he likes. But this place has a habit of reminding you who is really in charge. Even the Queen’s representative Black Rod has to ask the MPs if they wouldn’t mind coming to hear the Queen. Even party leaders struggling to make the smallest of Smalltalk cannot be sure there MPs will follow them. And there are 182 new MPs in the Commons. It will be Dave who helped decide whether to back, block, amend what the Government proposers -- decide whether to back, block, amend what the Government proposers -- it will be they. My government will continue with its long-term plan to provide economics ability at every stage of life. What will dominate their futures and matter for decades to come is none of that. It is Europe. My government will renegotiate the UK’s relationship with the European Union and pursue reform of the European Union for the benefit of all member states. Promises can of course be much easier to make them deliver. just listen to this. My government will bring forward proposals for a British Bill of Rights. No end yet to the Human Rights Act so many Tories love to hate. Michael Gove may have fancy new roads but he has not got the votes he needs to change the law. At times it may have sounded as if Her Majesty was reading the Tory election manifesto. The Government that wrote the speech wants to exploit the fact they have got the political stage to themselves while the opposition are in disarray. There is another reason too. They know Europe is coming and with it divisions. The discipline in the Tory party may simply not last. Altogether, 25 proposed new laws were announced today. The Government is highlighting a bill to guarantee no increases in income tax, VAT or National Insurance, a Childcare Bill to double the amount of free childcare available to working parents, and an Immigration Bill to crack down on illegal workers. Order. Today was quite simply all about the election, stupid. Time for the winners to croak and for those they defeated to try not very hard to sound magnanimous I congratulate the right honourable memberfor Witney. He returns to this House as Prime Minister. Labour’s interim leader said the Tories’ words sounded an awful lot like labour’s election promises. We fear the reality will be very different from the rhetoric. The Queen’s Speech talks of one nation yet he sets the nations of the country against each other. It talks of working people yet he threatens basic rights at work. The Prime Minister sounds like a man in a hurry, to pass laws before his good luck and tiny parliamentary majority vanishes. We have a clear mandate from the British people, a long-term economic plan that is working, a detailed and compelling manifesto and we will not waste a single moment with getting on with the task. So far, so familiar. Look who is back. Where once the SNP had six MPs, now there are 56. They are wearing the White Rose of Scotland. It is an honour to reply to the Queen’s Speech on the half of the third-party in the House of Commons, the Scottish National Party. It is our intention to be the effective opposition to this government. Be in no doubt, the SNP are here to get noticed, even if that means breaking the rules. The convention that we do not clap in the chamber is very, very long established. And he is back too but now on the opposition benches with the support ofjust seven fellow Lib Dems. The warning lights of a full-blown constitutional crisis are flashing. Yet it is telling that this Queen’s Speech contains a plan to weaken our human rights but not to strengthen our Constitution. The sun might seem to be shining on the new Tory government but they know the hard work is scarcely even begun. Let’s talk about the SNP, the Scottish National Party, the third biggest grouping in the House of Commons... They say they will seek urgent clarity on how Mr Cameron will legislate to ensure English votes for English laws. The SNP is also insisting that measures to transfer more powers from Westminster to the Scottish parliament are not radical enough. james Cook has more details. Queen’s View on Loch Tummel, made famous by Britain’s Queen Victoria but probably named for Isabella of Scotland. In this nation, there are always two competing stories and today, there are many competing views about the plans for Scotland in the Queen’s Speech. Once you let the nationalist genie out of the bottle, can you put it back in? I don’t know. But that said, devolution, it’s a good thing. This is also a good spot to take in the view from further afield. The Stevensons are on honeymoon here from the west of England. I enjoy coming up here, I enjoy us all being a part of one nation and I think as soon as everything gets questioned, where does it end, really? As long as it all feels like we are united with it, as long as some things come to Edinburgh and some go to London, you know... And some things to Gloucestershire, maybe? Exactly, yeah. Extra powers being proposed for Scotland include control of income tax rates, the share of revenue from VAT and some welfare payments. These new powers haven’t really changed since they were agreed last year, but since then, the SNP have transformed Scotland’s political landscape, winning almost all of the country’s seats at Westminster. And the nationalists argue that gives them a mandate to go much further. The Queen’s Speech really underlines the fact that the priorities of the UK Government are not the priorities of the Scottish Government- and, I would argue, of Scotland. There is very little in the Queen’s Speech - in fact, there is nothing in the Queen’s Speech - that would suggest that David Cameron and his Government are listening to the very loud message that the people of Scotland sent at the General Election. Back in Perthshire, they are in tune with that view. At this performance, the prospect of more powers was proving popular. A brilliant thing, there should be more of it, but I think if there is going to be any more powers, it will be strategic more than anything from Westminster. So it will be interesting to see what is given and what is not. Do you think these powers will be delivered? Do you think they will be enough? I hope they will be delivered. And I hope there’s plenty. And so the debate about Scotland’s future runs on and on. David Cameron says he will consider calls for even more powers, but not for the first time, the SNP is preparing for battle. james Cook, BBC News at Queen’s View in Perthshire. And there were a number of other bills announced today, including a bill to devolve more powers to England’s cities, if they want them, an Education Bill for England creating powers to take over so-called coasting schools, as well as those considered to be failing, a Housing Bill that gives housing association tenants the right to buy their homes, an Employment Bill that will reduce the cap on benefits payments, a bill to give intelligence agencies new powers - critics call it a Snooper’s Charter and a Trade Unions Bill under which members will have to choose to opt in if they want part of their fees to go to a political party. There were other clauses in the proposed legislation. Nick Robinson is here. A quick thought at this point about the fact that this is the first exclusively Conservative programme of Government since 1996. It is and I am struck by the words of the senior Conservative who once said politics is like riding a bike, you have got to be moving forward, there is no standing still. If you try, you fall over. That is why the Tories are trying to seize the ground vacated by the collapse of their opponents and why all the talk of one Nation and working people and helping at every stage of life, they are trying to seize ground that they once lost. There is another reason, reality, they know, will soon kick in. There will be bumps and potholes on the road ahead. Most of all, in that place, they scarcely have the votes they need to get the laws that they want and in the House of Lords, they don’t have them at all. That is why there is no human rights bill to replace the one they hate from the Labour Party. Simply, David Cameron might be Prime Minister, he may have won an election but he can’t get it through that place. Nick, thank you very much. I must remind you, lots more detail and analysis on the Queen’s Speech and all the measures on the BBC website. That’s at bbc.co.uk/news. More from Westminster a little later, but now back to jane. Many thanks. The time now is edging UP Many thanks. The time now is edging up to 6:20pm. Our top story this evening. Top Fifa officials have been arrested in Switzerland amid claims of high-level corruption. And still to come: A view from the factory floor on the Queen’s speech and the Government’s plans. Later on BBC London: Why the former Olympics minister joined a dawn raid to find rogue landlords in East London. And the new laws to deal with t he thousands of horses left abandoned Scientists say a genetically-engineered version of a virus that causes cold sores shows real promise for treating skin cancer. Research found that when the therapy - called T-VEC - was injected into tumours, it could halt their growth or even eradicate them. It’s the first study to prove an increase in survival using the drug, although it only worked for some melanoma patients. Here’s our Health Correspondent jane Dreaper. It is a common cancer and can be deadly. Melanoma kills more than 2,000 people in Britain every year. Scientists are excited that this landmark trial has shown a new way of helping some patients survive. So how does the treatment work? A version of the herpes virus that causes the common cold sore is the key to this treatment. The virus has been genetically modified so when it is injected into a patient, it is harmless to healthy cells but attacks and kills the cancerous ones. The herpes virus has also been redesigned to make it attractive to the immune system so that cancer tumours in various parts of the body are attacked. The study of more than 400 patients with inoperable melanoma is the biggest of its kind. And while it was not effective for everyone, one in ten patients saw their tumours destroyed. While others saw their life expectancy extended by years. This is what it looks like when T-VEC gets to work OI’I B CBFICEF lUITIOUIâ. The green area shows where the virus has already infected the cancerous cells and is killing them off. In the blue areas, they are beginning to show signs of damage and they will die shortly. Researchers think the new melanoma treatment could eventually work for other forms of cancer. They hope it will be licensed by regulators soon. This trial reported today represents ten years of work but we already have submitted the data package to the regulatory authorities in America and also in Europe and we expect, with favourable opinion, that the drug could be available for treating patients within the next year. There are still questions about which patients will benefit and whether other drugs need to be taken at the same time. But skin cancer charities say the promise of extra years of life for some people at a late stage of the disease gives new hope. jane Dreaper, BBC News. A brief look at some of the day’s other other news stories now. Tony Blair is to step down as Middle East envoy after eight years in the role. He will leave the post, in which he represented the United Nations, the US, the EU and Russia, next month - though sources close to the former Prime Minister said he intends to remain active in the region. An eight-year-old boy has died in an accident at a cemetery in Glasgow. It’s understood three boys were hit by a falling gravestone at Craigton cemetery. Police say they are investigating the incident but it’s not being treated as suspicious. At least 17 people have been killed, and dozens injured, in the American states of Oklahoma and Texas after record rainfall. The storms caused widespread damage to homes and stranded hundreds of motorists. Parts of Houston remain underwater- and more heavy rain is expected over the next few days. That’s all from me. More now from Huw Edwards at Westminster. Today’s Queen’s Speech, according to the Prime Minister, was a ""programme for working people"", a programme to unite the country, with measures on tax, childcare and immigration. So we asked our correspondent jon Kay to see what people had to say about the proposed measures in South Gloucestershire. A world away from the silk robes and the sapphires, the factory floor at Fairway Engineering. Exactly the kind of place where the Government hopes its message will be heard. On the production line, we met Roman, whose family came here from eastern Europe after the war. Polish parents, born in Cheltenham. But he is worried about immigration today and once an EU referendum. today and wants an EU referendum. There may be a Bill in the Queen’s Speech, but with a small majority, he wonders if the Government can deliver. Imean, I could turn around and say I am going to run a four-minute mile. It doesn’t mean to say I can do it. But I’ve said it. So, you know, it is promises, isn’t it? jason is 25 and works here as an apprentice. His top priority is to get on the housing ladder. He hopes the Government’s plans to freeze income tax for the next five years will allow him to plan his finances and finally save up a deposit. How tough is it right now? It is impossible, trying to rent and obviously save money for a mortgage, it is difficult. Are you getting close? No, nowhere near yet, but looking forward to it. Working as much overtime as I can. This constituency was won by the Tories at the election and they are hoping their message of blue-collar conservatism will appeal to people here. Sam is Fairway’s delivery driver. As a working mum, she likes today’s bills on free childcare and making the NHS more accessible, but she told me she will believe it when she sees it. If it can be done and there is some money for it, then great. You don’t sound convinced. I’m not. Why not? Ijust think it is going to cost too much. That is something we heard a lot today. Plans are one thing, but will the reality measure up? john Kay, BBC News, South Gloucestershire. Nick is with me once again. We should explain to viewers, helicopters in the sky, lots of noise, some police here, we have had a protest here in the last hour or so, partly, Isuppose, a protest here in the last hour or so, partly, I suppose, telling us about some of the opposition David Cameron will face in the years to come. It is a reminder that politics doesn’t only happen in Parliament, it happens on the streets and add in the country and precisely because there are people who do not like the election result and do not accept it and wish to fight some of the proposals we have seen today, there have been demonstrations here, outside Downing Street, walking down Whitehall. So far, a few hundred people, completely peaceful, but the helicopters, the police sirens, signs of the preparation, and a reminder of what we heard today, a Parliamentary wish list, what the Government hopes to do, but there is a lot we didn’t hear. For example, the cuts that will come in a budget injuly. The people are protesting against those. The Government will not get everything its own way and there are people here and people watching tonight who want to be sure of that. Nick, thanks again. It seems like a good moment to go to my colleague Nina to see the weather coming up. That evening, a couple of unsettled days of weather to come, cool and blustery tomorrow with some showers mainly across the north-west of the UK. Northern and Western areas today stayed pretty cloudy with outbreaks of rain, just 9 degrees for some places. Early sunshine in London, it has clouded over but still managed around 20 degrees, so a huge contrast around the country. Southern counties on the tail end of the system, so not a huge amount of rain as it clears to the North Sea. Some showers rattling in behind through the night with clear spells in between, so temperatures where there are breaks, down into single figures in the North, perhaps not so cold in the south. Southern areas on Thursday, a bright and breezy day, the odd shower, but most places will be dry. Further north, we become heavier showers and more frequent downpours, some of them thundery, mainly through parts of northern England, Northern Ireland and Scotland, and where we get brightness in between the showers, temperatures struggling, 11 or 12. For England and Wales, the mid-teens, cooleracross For England and Wales, the mid-teens, cooler across south-east England. Southern parts of England and Wales on Friday have the potential to become more overcast with outbreaks of rain. It looks like it will clear to the south through the afternoon. Scotland and Northern Ireland are sticking with the blustery theme, scattering some showers and some of them heavy and again, temperatures on the cool side, 12-13. As far as the weekend bmmu side, 12-13. As far as the weekend forecast is concerned, reach of high-pressure moving through on Saturday, so generally dry, fine and bright but by Sunday, it looks like it will be wet and windy.

Signs that Shaker Ahmad - the last British resident being held at Guantanamo Bay may be released next month. And comedy meets the CIA - as Miranda Hart makes her Hollywood debut as a spy. Welcome to BBC London News with me, Riz Lateef. This programme has learnt that suspects riding motorcycles in London have adopted a new tactic to prevent themselves from being caught. We can reveal that many criminals now take their helmets off on purpose when riding away from police so that officers in pursuit, stop immediately. Charlotte Franks explains. The helicopter police in London track and erratic driver on a motorbike. Officers could pursue him by car as well. If he was a London the chances are that the police would not chase because he is not wearing a helmet. We have seen an e-mail that suggests officers say that suspects across the capital are taking their helmets off to avoid being caught. Last month we explained how the the police rarely pursue those without protective wear because if they fall off they are likely to die. This man has been targeted by criminals on numerous occasions. I find it credible they can drive off and take their helmets off and the chase has to stop. I think we have to stop giving criminals any chance of taking what is not there is. At Freedom of Information request has revealed that over the last year there have been over 1200 crimes across the capital where suspects have been riding motorbikes or more pets at the time. One police officer revealed that it is pretty much impossible to stop. We have a moral duty and a mandate as police officers to protect the public which includes offenders who are trying to escape from us. If an offender is not wearing a helmet that will be factored in. This youth died in a police chase but he was not escaping scene of a crime. He was wearing a helmet and his friend aboard was not. Police might say that he was breaking the law so the police had every right to treat them. -- chase him. He was not driving. They were the reason that he got onto the bike and they are trained professionals who are trained to assess risk. Following the accident they Independent Police Complaints Commission recommended changes to the guidelines on pursuits but it is the case similarly that suspects are taking advantage of these proposals and the police are powerless to stop them. Coming up later in the programme: Measures to curb walkouts on the tube - the Government plans to toughen the law on trade union strike ballots. The number of sexual offences reported on London’s public transport has risen by a third in the last year. However overall, total crime is at a record low - with seven crimes for every million journeys on the network. It comes as Transport for London released details for policing the tube when all-night services begin in September. Our Home Affairs Correspondent Nick Beake reports. The man in the grey suit is staring at you. Would you reported? This is the latest campaign to urge more of us to report sexual abuse on public transport. Transport for London says that 10% of passengers have experienced unwanted sexual behaviour. Chloe says that in the three years she has been a student in London she has been groped more than half a dozen times in London. When it gets packed you get the odd hand there and wonder if that is really appropriate. Have you reported it? No but it would be good of people dead. I thought it was unacceptable but at the same time you get a bit used to it. The number of reported sex offences across the transport network has gone up from 972 to more than 1300 and the past year, 35% increase but across the underground and buses and Docklands light Railway and overgrown overall crime is down by 8%. Sexual offences have been underreported but I still very rare. We have encouraged people to report all times they feel unsafe on the network. Both transport and police bosses claim that the rise and reports does not mean an actual rise in the number of incidents. A lot of crime and public transport is alcohol related and from September five lines will be running overnight. Today British Transport Police said how they would respond to that challenge. We will deploy 100 extra officers every night for the night tube which is a significant uplift. We want people to be able to travel around and not notice the difference between it being too in the morning to the afternoon. We have seen increases in they -- number of assaults on staff. Think it is imperative that is adequate policing to make the whole thing a success. Officers say they will keep levels of policing proportionate on the night tube. The lawyer for the last British resident being held at Guantanamo Bay has told the BBC he expects his client to be released next month. Shaker Aamer, whose family live in Battersea, has been held there for 13 years without charge or trial. He’s been cleared for release twice since 2007 by both President Bush and President Obama. Emilia Papadopoulos is outside the American Embassy now. Shaker Aamer’s lawyer Clive Stafford-Smith today said that various reliabe US government officials have told him --Reliable. MrAamerwas going to Mr Aamer was going to be released in june. Though he did stress that he and Mr. Amer’s family were not getting too excited, as they have of course been here before. Shaker Aamer was cleared for release in 2007 by the Bush administration and then again in 2009 by President Obama but still remains in Gunatanamo Bay were he’s been for the last 13 years. Now, Mr Aamer is a Saudi national, who was given British residency in 1996 and lived in South London with his wife and four children. He was detained in Afghanistan in 2001 after US authorities said he’d led a unit of Taliban fighters and met Osama Bin Laden - allegations which Mr. Aahmer categorically denies. Well, the BBC spoke to him two years ago, and asked if he was hopeful about ever leaving Guantanamo. Yes I believe it will happen very soon but I fear that my children when they call me daddy, I will not respond because I have been responding to 239, and number not the name for so long. I have not even seen my youngest children. I have missed my wife and my children and my life for 11 years. Now, he’s never been charged or been on trial - and there have been campaigns here in London and around the world calling for his release. Last week, four cross-party MPs travelled to the States to try and secure his release. One of them was former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell. We are hopeful that we have advanced the case and spoke to a number of very senior senators who were as perplexed as we were asked why it was taking so long for him to be released for transfer and it is to last comprehensible -- it is to us in comprehensible by the United States would treat its oldest ally in this very cavalier way. What is the government saying about this? Well, back injanuary David Cameron also asked for Shaker Aamer be transferred back to the capital on his visit to the States - meanwhile the Foreign Office said The US authorities have now prioritised this case for review. So while the diplomacy continues - for the Amer family, the wait goes on. An investigation into evidence given to the Stephen Lawrence murder inquiry by a former Met Police chief has widened to include other senior officers. The Independent Police Complaints Commission began an investigation last month into information provided by ex-Met Police commissioner Lord Stevens. The watchdog said it was trying to establish if any senior officers failed to provide truthful accounts. Lord Stevens has denied any wrongdoing. A former MP has avoided jail after attacking two teenagers in North London. Ericjoyce attacked the boys aged 14 and 15 after claiming he was making a ""citizen’s arrest"" in Chalk Farm last year. Today at Westminster Magistrates court he was given a ten-weekjail term suspended for two years and fined more than £1000. As we’ve been hearing, the Queen has set out the Government’s programme for the next year, in the formal state opening of Parliament. Among the bills are plans to toughen the law on trade union strike ballots which the government hopes will curb industrial action on the tube. Here’s our Politcal Correspondent Karl Mercer. The government pla ns The government plans to put an end to these sort of scenes. As promised in their manifesto, the Conservatives will be shared with new lows to make those in essential services find it harder to go on strike and raise the required time out to 50% and the level required for strike action to 1+0% of the workforce. The strike affecting many people. It means they are getting unfair benefits and I do not think it is right. I think the government should take a harder stance on it. The RMT union is currently balloting members. We do things to the letter and we have a majority vote every time and that is a secret vote so they are looking to shackle us and we will resist this decision with all the means at our disposal. The result of their latest ballot is due before the end ofjune. It is meant as an assault on their freedoms and with everything going on with austerity and public sector pay freezes and job cuts they think the government is looking for a fight on this. The new law is something that the Borisjohnson has long pushed for an them an extra weapon against the Tube unions he is class was so often. We have seen strikes triggered by turnouts in the 20s and in the teens. That is unfair and everybody else. The most damaging strikes would have been cot by this legislation. Ido think that the hard-working people who want to continue to what is a storming success story and London have a protection with this. The Unionists say it is our-- the unions say it is a provocation. Next: A call to give London councils more powers to crack down on rogue landlords. On a dawn raid in Newham - Dame Tessa jowell - who wants to be Labour’s next mayoral candidate says the government’s limited the ability of authorities to deal with the problem. But critics say licensing doesn’t work, and there are already powers that councils don’t use. Here’s our Political reporter Susana Mendonca. Three adults are supposed to live here but we counted at least eight and that should not be any children at this property. It is not acceptable that we should allow this and 21st-century London. While we were checking out this house the couple next door invited us to look at their home. joseph shows me the bathroom he and his wife share with two other people. He is a cleaner who came from Uganda over a decade ago. They do not claim benefits and this is all they can afford to buy the landlord wants them out. The landlord says that we have to pay hundred £50 per week and we are paving hundred £50 per week and we are paying 93 says he has to get someone who can pay that amount of money. We are afraid and we have little savings and houses are still very expensive and are almost all in this sort of state. These are the kind of conditions that Londoners are being forced to live in. This looks like it has never been cleaned and that is mauled in the ceiling. The government says the tenants should not be allowed to live in unsafe conditions and they have given councils powers to deal with that broke landlord submit new which brought in its Badr system says that is being denied. --Newham which brought in a new system. We would bring in a new scheme with a view for the government to allow their own licensing scheme in the Barras for landlords. What we see as councils looking to get as much revenue from landlords and tenants as possible but not solving the problems they need to target. The need to stop bad landlords is one thing all sides agree on but the question is how. Coming up: As English cricket continues to put its house in order with announcement of a new coach I catch up with the one-day captain, Eoin Morgan. New legislation has been brought in this week to tighten the laws around abandoned horses. Around 1+000 across the country are left illegally on land without the owner’s permission. It’s particularly dangerous in Hertfordshire as horses are left close to major highways, often causing road traffic accidents. Our reporter, Helen Drew is near one of those busy roads with more details. Behind these trees is the A1+101+, just outside St Albans. There were 32 horses in this field last month but since then 11 falls have been born. Some are just days old. --Foals. They do not have the best art and life. They are left to graze and somebody else’s land without permission and it can mean that they do not get enough to eat. It was full to see and they did not have enough food and were not being wormed and was slowly starving because the mother could not produce enough milk. The new Control of Courses Act means that action can be taken quickerand Courses Act means that action can be taken quicker and landowners can move horses after four days instead of 11+ which is better for the horses and reduces damage to the land and reduces the risk of road accidents. A lot of the horses that fly grazed by main roads. We do get a lot of stray horses on the roads and that has serious potential for collisions. The new rules should mean less expense for landowners. Under the previous legislation the only option for landowners was to sell the horses at public option but they needed to do that by making sure that horses were micro-chipped and had horse passports and any necessary veterinary treatment was paid for. They were then brought back cheaply by former horse owners with all the work having been done. Now there are more options. You can hand the horse over to charity and find somebody else at riding school or some other person to buy the horse or of the horse is very unwell and its prospects are pretty bleak you can have them humanely euthanasia. --Euthanised. The problem is not confined to Hertfordshire and on Sunday five horses running along the motorway near Basildon and one of the horses was hit. On Monday there was another incident but the police managed to get the horses off the road before there was an incident. -- an accident. Protestors have been demonstrating in Westminster over a range of government policies set out in the Oueen’s Speech today. Anti-austerity activists gathered to oppose cuts to welfare spending, the toughening of strike ballot laws and plans to abolish the Human Rights Act. A police spokeswoman said two arrests had been made. The government says the speech amounts to a ""programme for working people"" that will create full employment. The England cricket one-day captain Eoin Morgan has backed the decision to appoint Trevor Bayliss as the new coach of the national team. Morgan has returned to club side Middlesex ahead of their first Twenty20 home game at Lords tomorrow. And after five tough months away - he’s glad to be back in London as Sara Orchard reports. Blink and you might miss them but England one-day captain Eoin Morgan is back with Middlesex. I have spent five months away from home this winter and it has been quite a tough winter. Despite the disappointing World Cup the new director of cricket, Andrew Strauss, has kept faith with Morgan as one-day captain. Trevor Bayliss being appointed as coach suits this 22 ruled. --28-Year-old. Ithink appointed as coach suits this 22 ruled. --28-Year-old. I think he is a very good appointment for the job. Come tomorrow, it will be Middlesex taking centre stage when they take on Kent and the team working tissue after their skills and the trophy and Canary Wharf. --In Canary Wharf. We mess Eoin Morgan when he is gone that make the most of them when he is here. --Miss Eoin Morgan.-- make the most of him. She’s about to make her Hollywood debut in a comedy spy film - appropriately called Spy. Miranda Hart plays the sidekick to Melissa McCarthy of Bridesmaids fame. With suave jude Law thrown in for good measure. Our entertainment correspondent, Brenda Emmanus caught up with her in Leicester Square. Congratulations on a hilarious film. Being a London for the Premier is amazing. This is so much fun. I have never been here for a Premier and it is huge and crazy. Miranda, you start a role written specifically for you. start a role written specifically foryou. He for you. He told me what the role and the john would be and I was sold. --Genre. Ido not think he plots and plans better writes what he does for funny people and he is a great writer and an amazing director and thank God that at the moment he is favouring very interesting female parts. I have described it asjames Bond with very funny female roles. I think that is a very fair description. At the end of the film you hope to be married tojude Law and adopts Melissa as your sister. How are you getting on the back? I am not marrying jude Law. If I get anotherjob after this, lovely but England is my home and I will always stick by British television but this is an amazing opportunity and I would love to do more if anybody would employ me. Let’s get a check on the weather with Tomasz Shafernaker. Temperatures were up to 21 degrees. It will stay pretty cloudy from now on words but mostly drive. At five o’clock in the morning it will be around 12 degrees. Tomorrow will not be quite as warm today -- as today and it will be a bit fresher with just a very small chance of a shower but on balance and other good day with tempters getting up to 19 degrees but maybe around the mid teens are the high teens around the London area. Friday looks very different. That is a weather front scooting off to the Atlantic -- from the Atlantic. This is first thing in the morning. It looks quite wet first thing on Friday and some of that rain might last into the afternoon so not a great day. It will feel a lot fresher and tempters in some spots might be as low as 13 degrees. All this a little bit warmer and central parts of London. A big contrast from day-to-day. You might wonder about the weekend. Out of Saturday and Sunday your best bet to make the most of the weather is Saturday when it should be quite bright with temperatures around 18 degrees. The main headlines: Seven high ranking Fifa officials are awaiting extradition to the US after being arrested this morning in Switzerland. US authorities allege they’re among dozens involved in bribery, racketeering and money laundering going back more than 20 Years. I’ll be back with the latest during the ten o’clock news. From me and Welcome to your Wednesday One Show with Matt Baker. And Alexjones. Now, beafraid. We have new technology tonight which allows us to go live into the homes of two families that are watching us right now! Let’s meet the first family. Who could they be? Who lives there? Could it be the Hayes family from Wigan? APPLAUSE. Yes, it is. It’s the Hayes family. There is family number one. The second family is, the Writer family from Horley. Good evening to the Writers. What a wonderful bunch. Both families will go head-to-head in a series of different challenges, which we will introduce during the show. We hope it will be epic. More to come on that later. Stay where you are families. What a night this is going to be. First, on a day when Her Majesty the Queen has officially opened Parliament, we have our very own House of Lords here tonight. We do, indeed. Our guests, oh, that is dramatic. They were entering. Our guests this evening are no less than two knights and a Dame. The Dame is renowned percussionist, Dame Evelyn Glennie. She will treat us to a performance later on and we will find out what she is being awarded what is often referred to as the Nobel Prize of Music. And the knights are two legendary British actors of stage and screen, it’s Ian McKellen and -- Sir Ian McKellen and Sir Derekjacobi. Wonderful to have your company. Last time I had a Dame here. Damejudy your company. Last time I had a Dame here. Dame judy Andrews. We saw the State Opening of Parliament earlier. Pomp and ceremony. I love to watch that. We heard the confirmation there will be a referendum on the EU by the end of 2017. Is this something you will have to swot up on? Cameron is looking for reform? I mean, I’m for in. You are in.

There were police raids in Swizerland today as some of world football’s most prominent officials were arrested. And a separate investigation into the decision to award the World Cup finals of 2018 and 2022 to Russia and Qatar. This really is the World Cup of fraud, and today we’re issuing Fifa a red card. But Fifa’s boss, Sepp Blatter, who is not among those arrested, said he welcomed the investigations. We’ll have the latest from Zurich on allegations that leading figures pocketed $150 million in bribes. Also tonight: At the State Opening of Parliament the Queen unveils the Government’s agenda, including a referendum on EU membership, and taking more of the low- paid out of tax. My Government will legislate in the interests of everyone in our country. It will adopt a one-nation approach. It’s a programme for working people, say Ministers, so we’ll be talking to some workers in South Gloucestershire. And a report on the migrant crisis on the Greek island of Kos, where 1,200 have been rescued in the past few days. On BBC London: The number of sexual offences on public transport goes up, but overall crime is at a record low. And the publication of a serious case review puts Haringey Social Services in the spotlight once again. Good evening. World football’s governing body, Fifa, is engulfed in a major crisis, with some of its leading figures accused of ‘rampant corruption’. Seven senior officials were arrested this morning in Switzerland as part of an American investigation into corrupt practices. This afternoon in New York came detailed allegations of bribery, racketeering and money laundering. Criminal proceedings have also been launched in Switzerland in connection with Fifa’s decision to award the World Cup finals of 2018 and 2022 to Russia and Qatar. Our sports editor, Dan Roan, is in Zurich tonight with the latest. Over the years here at Fifa headquarters, in truth at times it is easy to seem a little numb about the latest controversy. But even by the tainted standards of world football’s governing body, this feels rather different. A crisis perhaps like never before. Over the years, Zurich has offered Fifa’s top executives safe territory, but that changed this morning at 6 o’clock. They didn’t see it coming. It was the wake-up call no-one at Fifa had expected. A dawn raid as plain clothed Swiss police officers descended on one of Zurich’s most luxurious hotels. Seven senior football officials arrested and now facing extradition to the United Statesment among them one of the game’s most powerful men, Fifa’s Vice-President, jeffrey Webb. Today’s dramatic events were instigated by the FBI, which has been investigated officials at football’s world governing body for three years. Beginning in 1991, two generations of soccer officials used their positions of trust within their respective organisations to solicit bribes from sports marketers in exchange for the commercial rights to their soccer tournaments. They did this over and over, year after year, tornment after tournament. The scale of the alleged corruption is breathtaking. Suspected bribes worth almost £100 million paid over almost a quarter of a century. The conspiracy even extending to the decision to award South Africa the 2010 World Cup and the Fifa presidential election a year later. This really is the World Cup of fraud. And today we are issuing Fifa a red card. Tonight another arrest warrant was issued for disgraced former Fifa power brokerjack Warner, who gave this response to the charges brought against him. . It does seem strange that the US can made this two days before the election. It is naive to believe it has nothing to do with it. The arrests are thought to relate in part to bribes given to former Fifa officials by ISL, a now defunct sports marketing company, the subject of a BBC Panorama investigation in 2010. Fifa lurched towards another crisis after a newspaper probe into allegations alleged corruption into the awarding of the two World Cups. Qatar. It is that credential decision that remarkably is now the subject of even more criminal proceedings announced today. This time by Swiss federal prosecutors who raided Fifa headquarters and will question ten executives over the vote five years ago. In a hastily arranged press conference however, Fifa put a positive spin on the day’s events. This for Fifa is good. It is not goodin This for Fifa is good. It is not good in terms of image. It is not goodin good in terms of image. It is not good in terms of reputation. But in terms of cleaning up, in terms of everything what we did in the last four years, everything what we did in the last fouryears, in four years, in terms of the reform process, this is good. Tonight Fifa President Sepp Blatter, who was not among those arrested, tried to get a grip on the scandal. In a statement saying. Misconduct has no place in football and we’ll ensure that those who engage in it are put out of the game. But European governing body Uefa now wants Friday’s presidential election to be postponed after 17 years in charge, Blatter was expected to easily beat rival jordanian Prince Ali. But critics have said it is time for change. It is nauseating to be involved in football and have to suffer this ongoing embarrassment to the game thatis ongoing embarrassment to the game that is the governing body. The election should be suspended for now. It is common sense I think should reveal, but that doesn’t always exist in the towers of Fifa. Blatter arrived here this week looking confident. He may not feel quite so assured tonight. The Fifa corruption allegations originated in the USA, where Fifa’s mutimillion pound deals have been under the spotlight. FBI investigators who’ve been looking at deals going back to the early 1990s said they’d uncovered fraud, racketeering and money laundering. Our New York correspondent, Nick Bryant, has been following the story. The headquarters of a sports organisation that today looked more like a crime scene. FBI agents raiding the Miami offices of Concacaf, football’s governing body in north and Central America as well as the car been. Its President is amongst those indicted on racketeering and money laundering charges. The kind commonly levelled against mobsters. And look at the stealy determination of the investigators, US law enforcement’s most powerful figures. Their presence in New York a measure of America’s fierce determination to clean up world football. The game according to the allegations in this indictment was hijacked, that field has that is so famously flat was tilted in favour of those looking to gain at the expense of countries and kids who were enjoying the game of soccer. As well as bulging files containing the indictment, diagrams showing how the bribery scheme works. The charge is that television rights were stitched up in an alliance with sports executives who shut out all competitors. I it wouldn’t be very clear. This is the beginning not of our effort, not the end. We look forward to continuing our work with our international partners and any others who are willing to work with us, as we seek to continue in our effort to be successful in ridding global soccer from this type of corruption. So who might the investigation target next? You have not indicted the current President of Fifa. Are you today giving Sepp Blatter a clean bill of health? Are you saying today that he is blameless of any alleged corruption? I’m not going to comment on the status of any individual who isn’t named to date, because that would be unfair to them in many ways. I can say that this investigation is ongoing, it is continuing, but the announcement todayis continuing, but the announcement today is about the charges involving just these individuals. America’s former football pour broker Chuck Blazer has already pleaded guilty. He reportedly assisted is FBI investigators by using a microphone hidden in a keyring to secretly record meetings. His criminal activity funded a lifestyle, including an apartment in Trump tower for his cats. It is the US authorities who’ve assumed the role of global policeman of the global game and also brought their full investigative power to bear. Our sports editor, Dan Roan, is in Zurich. We have heard allegations in the past about Fifa, what is your sense of the magnitude of this development today? In the past, Fifa’s been adept in dealing with its regular scandals very much inhouse, behind closed doors here at Fifa headquarters. But this is no internal inquiry that’s easy to control or dismiss. No, this involves one of the most serious law Enforcement Agencies in the world in the FBI. It is not as easy for Fifa to get a grip of this perhaps as they’ve found in the past. The fact that Uefa, European football’s all-powerful governing body, has come all-powerful governing body, has come out tonight threatening to boycott the General Assembly that begins here tomorrow unless the election on Friday is postponed tells you everything. It is the stakes being raised and I think Sepp Blatter’s opponents are seeking to capitalise on perhaps the biggest predicament of his career. He’s vastly experienced, one of sport’s great survivors. Don’t be surprised if he can overcome and resist calls for him to step down, calls to postpone that election, and even calls for a re-vote of the next two World Cups. Such a the scale of these allegationsers year after year, tournament after tournament, it seem this is the the biggest crisis that Blatter faces in his long reign, and this could just be the beginning. Dan, thank you. The Queen has unveiled the Government’s agenda at the State Opening of Parliament. The Queen’s Speech, which featured the first exclusively Conservative programme for nearly 20 years, included a commitment to hold a referendum on EU membership, significant constitutional change with further devolution to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and a ban on rises in income tax, VAT and National Insurance for the next five years. But legislation to replace the Human Rights Act has been delayed. Our political editor, Nick Robinson, has the details. Appearances can be deceptive. It may be Her Majesty who travels from the Palace to Parliament to deliver it. It may be accompanied by the finery and the flummery, but the reality is much more simple. This is the Prime Minister’s speech and one that David Cameron thought he might never get to make. REPORTER: Is life easier without the Lib Dems? Of course it is. He’s got a Tory majority now, so in theory - in theory - he can do what he likes. But this place has a habit of reminding you who is really in charge. Even the Queen’s representative, Black Rod, has to ask MPs if they wouldn’t mind coming to hear the Queen. Even party leaders struggling to make the smallest of small talk can’t be sure that their MPs will follow them. And there are 182 new MPs in the Commons. It will be they who help decide whether to back, to block, to amend what this Government proposes. My Government will continue with its long-term plan to provide economic stability and security at every stage of life. What will dominate their futures though and will matter for decades to come is none of that. It’s Europe. My Government will renegotiate the United Kingdom’s relationship with the European Union and pursue reform of the European Union for the benefit of all member states. Promises can of course be much easier to make than deliver. just listen to this. My Government will bring forward proposals for a British Bill of Rights. So, no end yet to the Human Rights Act so many Tories love to hate. Michael Gove may have fancy new robes, but he hasn’t got the votes he needs to change the law. At times it may have sounded as if Her Majesty was reading the Tory election manifesto. There’s a reason for that. The Government that wrote this speech wants to exploit the fact that they’ve got the political stage to themselves while the opposition are in disarray. There is another reason, too. They know that Europe is coming and with it divisions. The discipline in the Tory Party may simply not last. Altogether 25 proposed new laws were announced today. The Government’s highlighting a bill to guarantee no increases in income tax, VAT or national insurance. A Childcare Bill, to double the amount of free childcare available to working parents. And an Immigration Bill, to crack down on illegal workers. Today was quite simply all about the election, stupid. Time for the winners to crow and for those they defeated to try not very hard to sound magnanimous. I congratulate the right honourable member for Whitney. He returns to this House as Prime Minister. Labour’s interim leader said the Tories’ words sounded an awful lot like Labour’s election promises. We fear the reality of this Queen’s Speech will be very different from the rhetoric. The Queen’s Speech talks of one nation, yet he sets the nations of the country against each other. The Queen’s Speech talks of working people, yet he threatens basic rights at work. The Prime Minister sounds like a man in a hurry to pass laws before his good luck and his tiny parliamentary majority vanishes. We have a clear mandate from the British people, a long-term economic plan that is working, a detailed and compelling manifesto, and we will not waste a single moment with getting on with the task. So far so familiar, but look who’s back. Where once the SNP had six MPs, now there are 56, wearing the white rose of Scotland. It’s an honour to reply to the Queen’s Speech on behalf of the third party in the House of Commons. APPLAUSE. The Scottish National Party. It is our intention to be the effective opposition to this Government. Be in no doubt, the SNP are here to get noticed, even if that means breaking the rules. THE SPEAKER: Order. The convention that we don’t clap in this chamber is very, very, very long established. And he’s back too, but now on the opposition benches with the support ofjust seven fellow Lib Dems. The warning lights of a full-blown constitutional crisis are flashing. Yet it is telling that this Queen’s Speech contains a plan to weaken our human rights, but not to strengthen our constitution. The sun may seem to be shining on this new Tory Government, but they know that the hard work has scarcely even begun. We have the first ex-clue civil Queen speech for nearly 20 years. What did you make of it Succeeding in politics is like riding a bike, you can’t standstill. You are racing forward or you are falling off and getting a bloodied nose. The Tories tried to pedal massively hard to fill the space they think is vacated by the problems that Labour and the Liberal Democrats are facing, in particular. That is why there are sound bites about one nation and being the Workers’ Party and coulding something for people in every stage of their life. Is another reason too. They know the good times politically, they can’t possibly last. Not only are there massive questions about Britain’s future in Europe, about the future of the UK itself, given what has happened in Scotland, but there are also bumps and potholes ahead for a Government with a tiny, tiny majority. 26, a handful of Tories to rebel, unite with the opposition. This Government can’t get its way. We saw that today, on human rights, a manifesto promise, the Tory press sagging a manifesto promise, the Tory press gagging for it, David Cameron can’t give them what they want. We will talk more about the challenges ahead for Mr Cameron, Nick, talk more about the challenges ahead forMrCameron, Nick, ina talk more about the challenges ahead for Mr Cameron, Nick, in a short while. Thanks for now. Nick Robinson there for us. Let’s look at other stories now. The EU Commission has announced plans to tackle the surge 40,000, mainly Syrians and Eritreans, are to be re-settled and EU countries will be asked to take another 20,000 refugees from outside Europe. Britain has already opted out of the plans. The authorities in the Greek island of Kos say they’ve rescued 1,200 in the past two days alone. The island is less than four miles from the Turkish coast and, for many migrants, it’s the quickest and easiest route into the EU. Our correspondent, Anna Holligan, sent this report. From a war FFOITI B WBT ZOFIE, They’ve reached Europe, at last. Flimsy inflatables, evidence of the risk an increasing number of people are prepared to take. From 300 a day, Kos is receiving double that. This tiny island is under pressure. This isn’t the image the Greek tourist industry wants to promote. TRANSLATION: We really beg for bad weather so that migrants are unable to cross. Almost 6,000 have come in the last couple of months because the weather has become so much better. They are living together on this island, and yet their worlds could never be further apart. I met a 23-year-old who arrived on Kos, four days ago. We have to hide his identity because he’s worried about the consequences for relatives left behind in Syria. We don’t scare because we say in my country the Tomahawk missile, the cruise missile, the killing everywhere. We saw a lot of things that I can’t have the meaning for that. There is a lot of problems. In Raqqa there is no house for me. We can’t come back. Can’t? Because they will kill us. Hundreds of migrants have turned this abandoned tourist hotel into their home. The conditions are cramped. There is no electricity. Until, just a few days ago, there was no running water. But, at least, they’re safe. At the local police station they queue for documents that will allow them to stay in Greece for six months. Most of these migrants are hoping to check out and move on soon. Their chances may be improved by the European Commission’s call for EU member states to take 40,000 asylum seekers from Syria and Eritrean over the next two years, to relieve some of the pressure on Greece and Italy. The UK Government says it will not take part in this system. Anna Holligan, BBC News in Kos. A brief look at some of the day’s other other stories. Tony Blair is to step down as Middle East envoy after eight years in the role. He will leave the post, in which he represents the United Nations, the US, the EU and Russia next month. But Mr Blair is said to be keen to remain active in the region. Scientists say that some of the most advanced skin cancers could be treated using a genetically-engineered version of the cold-sore virus. Research found that when injected into tumours it could halt their growth or even eradicate them. The number of people suffering from hunger around the world has fallen. The UN says it’s below the 800 million mark for the first time since it began recording figures, 25 years ago. But it warns of a deepening crisis in South Sudan due to a combination of civil war and a economic instability. The Scottish National Party, the third biggest grouping in the new House of Commons, says it will seek ""urgent clarity"" on how Mr Cameron could legislate to ensure English votes for English laws. There is to be further devolution for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, but the SNP insists measures to transfer more powers from Westminster to the Scottish Parliament are not radical enough. Here’s our Scotland correspondent, james Cook. Queen’s View on Loch Tummel, made famous by Britain’s Queen Victoria, but probably named for Isabella of Scotland. In this nation, there are always two competing stories, and today there are many competing views about the plans for Scotland in the Queen’s Speech. Once you let the nationalist genie out of the bottle, can you put it back in? I don’t know. But, that said, devolution, it’s a good thing. This is also a good spot to take in the view from further afield. The Stephensons’ are on honeymoon here from the west of England. As long, you know, it all feels like we’re united with it. As long as some things come to Edinburgh, some things go to London, whatever, you know. And some things to Gloucestershire maybe. Exactly, yeah. Extra powers being proposed for Scotland include, control of income tax rates, a share of revenue from VAT and some welfare payments. These new powers haven’t really changed since they were agreed last year, but since then the SNP have transformed Scotland’s political landscape, winning almost all of the country’s seats at Westminster. The nationalists argue that gives them a mandate to go much further. The Queen’s Speech really underlines the fact that the priorities of the UK Government are not the priorities of the Scottish Government and I would argue of Scotland there’s very little in the Queen’s Speech. In fact, there’s nothing in the Queen’s Speech that would suggest that David Cameron and his Government are listening to the very loud message that the people of Scotland sent at the general election. Back in Perthshire, they’re in tune with that view. At this performance, the prospect of more powers was proving popular. Brilliant thing, yeah. There should be more of it. But I think, if there is going to be any more powers, it’ll probably be strategic more than anything from Westminster. Do you think these powers will be delivered? Do they think they’ll be enough? I hope they’ll be delivered and I hope there’s plenty. And so the debate about Scotland’s future runs on and on. David Cameron says he will consider calls for even more powers but, not for the first time, the SNP is preparing for battle. james Cook, BBC News, at Queen’s View in Perthshire. There were a number of other Bills announced in the Queen’s Speech today: More powers for English cities, including a Bill to devolve more powers to England’s cities, if they want them. An Education Bill for England, creating powers to target so-called 'coasting schools’ as well as those considered to be failing. A Housing Bill that gives Housing Association tenants the right-to-buy their homes. Lower benefits cap and freeze working-age benefits. A Bill to give intelligence agencies new powers. Critics call it a snooper’s charter. A Trade Union Bill, obliging members to opt in if they want some of their fees to go to a political party. The programme announced by the Queen was, according to David Cameron, a ""programme for working people"", a programme to ""unite"" the country with measures on tax, childcare and immigration. So we asked our correspondent, jon Kay, to see what people had to say about the proposed measures in South Gloucestershire. A world away from the silk robes and the sapphires, the factory floor at Fairway Engineering, exactly the kind of place where the Government hopes its message will be heard. On the production line we met Roman, whose family came here from eastern Europe after the war. Polish parents, born in Cheltenham. But he’s worried about immigration today and wants an EU referendum. There may now be a Bill in the Queen’s Speech but, with a small majority, he wonders if the Government can deliver. I mean, I could just turn around and say, I’m going to run a four minute mile. It don’t mean to say I can do it, but I’ve said it. So, you know, it’s promises, isn’t it? jason is 25 and works here as an apprentice. His top priority is to get on the housing ladder. He hopes the Government’s plans to freeze income tax for the next five years will allow him to plan his finances and finally save up a deposit. How tough is it right now? Ah, it’s impossible, trying to rent and obviously save ITIOI’Iây ‘foI’ B ITIOI’tg8gâ. It’s very difficult. Are you getting close? No, nowhere near yet. Looking forward to it. Work as much overtime as we can. The Tories are keen to hold on to industrial constituencies like Kingswood after winning here at the general election. Promising to put working people at the heart of what they do. But many staff told us they’re still suspicious of so-called 'blue collar Conservatism’. Like Sam, the Fairway’s delivery driver. As a working mum, she likes today’s Bills on free childcare and making the NHS more accessible, but she told me, she’ll believe it when she sees it. If it can be done, and there’s the money for it, then great. You don’t sound convinced? I’m not. Why not? Because Ijust think it’s going to cost too much. That’s something we heard a lot today. Plans are one thing, but will the reality measure up? john Kay, BBC News, South Gloucestershire. What is the reality for David Cameron in terms of the things he is facing over the next few years? He hopes that people, we will be talking about those sort of things. If you have 25 proposed new laws there is meat and drink for people to focus that affects their every day life. There are big questions that will define whether this Queen’s Speech matters in the long-term. When historians look back at1 #4u7boo years they will not talk about apprenticeships or childcare am they will ask - talk about apprenticeships or childcare am they will ask - did new powers for Scotland, help Scotland stay in the UK or hasten its departure and the break up of the UK? They will ask another question - did a referendum on the EU help Britain stay in the EU or drive Britain out of the EU? It’s already clear that that is where the Prime Minister’s focus is. Tomorrow, he’ll be in Holland, then he will be in France. The next day he will be in Poland and then in Germany am they will publish the question for that EU referendum, not confirmed yet, but very likely to be very simple. Do you want Britain to remain a member of the EU? The answer to that question will decide whether this Queen’s Speech is still being talked about in 100 years time.

There are growing calls for the president, Sepp Blatter, to stand down. Fifa’s annual congress is due to begin this afternoon, and sponsors What has got to happen is that Fifa have got to be rid of Sepp Blatter. Sponsors are warning that they may review their ties with the organisation. We’ll be live in Zurich with the latest.

Later on BBC London: Warnings that scores of people are living on London’s canalside and Riverside. Plus a change is on the way for the summery weather. Your local and national forecast is coming up. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. Pressure is ill do an Sepp Blatter to stand down as president of Fifa. The Prime Minister has added to calls for the Fifa president Sepp Blatter to step down, saying the focus needs to be reforming football’s world governing body. Fifa is due to open its annual congress later, but is facing warnings from sponsors that they may review their ties with the organisation following the arrest of senior officials on corruption charges at the request of the United States. Sepp Blatter held meetings earlier on to discuss the crisis. Richard Conway is in Zurich. The developments here are continuing apace. The pressure is mounting on Fifa and an Sepp Blatter. He hasn’t been seen in public since those dawn raids took seven Fever officials away into custody. They are now facing extradition to the United States. What I can tell you is that in the last few minutes, and a stand, andI in the last few minutes, and a stand, and I have spoken to people in and around Sepp Blatter, they tell me that as of last night, he had no intention of resigning, no intention of standing aside in this election. He intends to be a candidate come Friday afternoon. That leaves the man he faces with a big decision. Does he push for a postponement or press on and try to win? Is this the man who will oust Sepp Blatter as Fifa’s president? Prince Ali ofjordan may never have a better chance. There has been no sign of his election rival, Sepp Blatter. He hasn’t been spotted in public since the US instigated arrests yesterday morning, even failing to turn up and give a planned speech at a seminar yesterday. The president apologises not to be able to come today because of the turbulences you have probably followed in the media. So he has to fulfil his duty in the management of the situation as president today, which are probably more important than to come to us. Even though medicine is a very close to his heart. In public at least, Fifa is attempting to present an image that it is business as usual, but the pressure is mounting as fans, sponsors and officials voiced their concerns. The FA’s position hasn’t changed. We still think that what has got to happen is that they have got to be rid of Sepp Blatter. Mr Blatter, whether he’s involved in any of these shenanigans or not, is irrelevant. He is the person who has led Fifa for I6 years, and now we look at the results. And he must take responsibility. The ripples of this latest controversy haveis ripples of this latest controversy have is bread far and wide. Vladimir Putin, whose country was controversially given the rights to host the 2018 World Cup, is concerned. TRANSLATION: One thing is clear. This has nothing to do the United States. If something did happen, thenit States. If something did happen, then it didn’t happen on the territory of the United States. It isjust another attempt territory of the United States. It is just another attempt to extend theirjurisdiction to other countries. For those who wish to sea change at the top of world football, the next few hours will be interesting as the crisis continues to develop. In the next few hours, Sepp Blatter will arrive to start Fifa’s National Congress. The world wants to hear what he has to say about how he will extricate himself and Fifa’s reputation. Some of the world’s best-known brands are sponsors of the Fifa World Cup. They’re facing increasing calls to put pressure on Fifa and to review their ties. Visa says it will reassess its sponsorship unless Fifa makes changes, and Coca-Cola and Adidas voiced concern. Ben Thompson is here. Thank you very much. Things are moving fast. The statement from Visa follows the dramatic arrests on Wednesday of several senior Fifa officials on corruption charges. The company has said: Coca-Cola has said: And Adidas has said it was ""fully committed to creating a culture that promotes the highest standards of ethics and compliance, and we expect the same from our partners."" Fifa’s long-term president, Sepp Blatter, has chaired a meeting. Uefa have joined calls for him to step down. The results are increasing pressure on the organisation to postpone its leadership vote tomorrow. Speaking this morning, the culture Secretary, john Whittingdale, described Fifa is a deeply flawed organisation, and called on other sponsors to reconsider their ties. ~ I also welcomed the statement from Uefa, and it is important that other sponsors consider following Visa’s lead. So what’s at stake, and how important are the lucrative sponsorship deals for organisations like Fifa? Top sponsors Top SpoI’ISOIâS pay up Top sponsors pay up to £30 million a year. The World Cup generated nearly £1 billion is on to ship deals last time it was held. Ash Max Porter sheet deals. ~ -- sponsorship deals. One branding expert that used to advise Fifa told me getting the leadership right at Fifa is crucial to keeping sponsors on board. It is going to be their responsibility to make sure that the brand turns into an organisation with purpose and principles, so that when it talks about itself as a brand, it shows that in actions as well. And the whole idea of sponsorship is that firms can cash in on our interest in great sporting events, but face of allegations like these, it is no surprise that Russia is mounting on the sponsors to reconsider their links with Fifa. Ben Thompson, thank you. Our assistant political editor Norman Smith is in Westminster. The Prime Minister has been speaking about all of this as well? And what is striking, normally, when the government is critical of an international organisation, it tends to catch its criticism in careful language. Not so with Fifa. They are quite blunt. Fever is a corrupt organisation, and Sepp Blatter must go. If he doesn’t go, they are happy for sponsors to pull the plug, and they are involved in talks with the FA this afternoon about the so-called nuclear option, which would be for the foot or association to pull out of Fifa, the hope being that that might trigger other European football associations to withdraw, forcing Sepp Blatter overboard. On the critical issue of whether or not the 2018 World Cup bid might be reopened, I have to be a party pooper. All of the indications are that the government is not going to press for that. I think the view in Downing Street is that they cannot fight and win that battle. Whatever the Garcia report may say, time has moved on. More than that, there is international politics involved. We are all ready involved in a diplomatic fistfight with President Putin over Syria and the Ukraine. If we were to now demand that he relinquished the World Cup in 2018, that would be a boot up the backside to see how he reacted. I doubt it would be favourable. I think it is unlikely that England will get the World Cup back for 2018. Norman Smith, thank you. Now the rest of the day’s news. David Cameron is beginning a whistle-stop tour of European capitals to gather support for a change in Britain’s membership of the European Union. The referendum question has been announced. Voters will be asked: ""Should the UK remain a member of the EU?"" The Prime Minister’s first stop is the Hague. let’s speak to our Europe correspondent Damian Grammaticas, who’s there. What sort of reception can he expect? He got here just under and are go, and he had a warm reception from the Dutch Prime Minister. He is in there now having lunch with him. The men shook hands, clapped each other on the back. They described each other as like-minded partners in Europe. They are both from the right side of the political spectrum. They both have to deal with parties in their own countries that are anti-EU, anti-immigration. They both said they agree on an approach which is that a decision should be made at a European level only where necessary, and national level where possible. And then they went off to have their discussions. But I think what is interesting, too, is that Mr Cameron will now be putting down some of his thoughts to the Dutch Prime Minister, but the Dutch very much aligned with the rest of Europe. They want the UK inside Europe. They believe is one of the major countries in Europe, it is important it is there, economically, politically, and the Dutch Prime Minister and others will be saying to Mr Cameron that all sides would be diminished drastically if the UK were to leave. But the question is, what is the price that Mr Cameron wants? And is that something that other EU leaders can deliver? If he is seen to be asking for exceptional deals for the British, that will not go down well. If he is looking for reforms that will benefit everyone in the EU, he may well get more bought-- support. Thank you very much, Damian Grammaticas. Nearly 2,000 cases of alleged physical and sexual abuse involving Methodist ministers have been revealed by the church. The accusations date back as far as the 1950s and span decades. They also involve employees, members and volunteers. The Methodist Church, which commissioned the investigation, has offered an apology to victims. Sangita Myska reports. In the 1950s, the Methodist Church in Britain was expanding, building churches, schools and entrenching itself in communities. But as today’s report reveals, a culture of failing to deal with issues of abuse was also developing. One victim, who doesn’t want to be identified, says he was sexually abused by a teacher at a Methodist funded school. He was just 11 years old when the abuse began. Ijust hated every minute of it. If I remember rightly, it always happened on Thursday night. The teacher involved would come into my dormitory in his dressing gown, and shout my name. And I would be taken to his room, where I was probably there for 15, 20, 25 minutes per time. The Methodist church’s past cases review identified 1885 perpetrators or alleged perpetrators of abuse. 914 cases were sexual in nature. In 33% of cases, the abusers or alleged abuses were ministers, lay employees and other office holders. According to the report, ministers found it difficult to recognise and accept that abuse was taking place, and when some did and tried to report it, they felt that they weren’t being listened to. Crucially, many ministers found it difficult to reconcile their religious duty to help abusers find redemption against their legal duty to help support victims. Today, victims of sexual, financial and domestic abuse were offered an unreserved apology. The church says sorry to them that it let them down, and the church promises to ensure that there are opportunities for them to explain to us their own particular feelings. There is an opportunity then for us to take that forward appropriately with statutory authorities. The report says that the passage of time and poor record-keeping means that this review has its shortcomings, but they add that the most serious cases, where possible, have been referred to the police. Sangita Myska, BBC News. A year-long study into the contamination of shop-bought raw chickens has found that nearly three quarters tested positive for the food poisoning bug Campylobacter. 19% of the chickens were found to contain the highest rate of the bacteria, which causes an estimated quarter of a million cases of food poisoning every year. Here’s our business correspondent Emma Simpson. Steph Hartley is back at work, just. She needs a taxi to get there. She got Cabella backed at a music festival last summer, which triggered something far worse. --. She spent five months in hospital with a neurological condition, a rare and unlucky consequence of this bug. I can’t believe that I got this just because I bet some chicken. Campylobacter is a naturally occurring bug, commonly found in chickens. We too many of them, says the FSA. So who has been selling the most infected words? After year of sampling, the FSA found that nearly one in five hole, raw chickens were contaminated. Tesco was the best performer atjust under contaminated. Tesco was the best performer at just under 13%. It was almost one in four at Asda. We feel that the industry still needs to do much more to reduce the levels and protect the consumer.

Our top story this lunchtime: Fifa president Sepp Blatter holds a meeting into the crisis engulfing his organisation, as pressure grows for him to resign. The only thing I knew for sure was that I was going to get eaten. Hashtag frighten. And still to come: The social media symbol our children love to use for expression. A BBC investigation has discovered that British security forces had thousands of agents and informants working inside paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland. The undercover operatives were recruited by the army, MI5 and Special Branch, and many were involved in criminality and murder. The Government says collusion with paramilitaries should never happen, and that it has apologised where it did. Our Ireland Correspondent Chris Buckler reports. During Northern Ireland’s years of violence, these roads close to the Irish border could be a dangerous place. Four decades ago, here in the village of Kings Mills in south Armagh, the IRA stopped a minibus, lined up the Protestant workers sitting inside, and shot them. just one of them survived. The noise was deafening. They’d shot us all at waist height to stop anyone running properly. I went down for I don’t know how long. Tonight, a BBC Panorama programme examines allegations of collusion in the killings, claims that agents and informers, people paid by the state, were involved in these and many other murders. Northern Ireland’s police ombudsman is currently investigating 60 cases in which the state has been accused of involvement. The police have now handed over intelligence files relating to them, but only after a court challenge. We are prepared to work with the ombudsman, but there is a need to understand the magnitude of what we are dealing with. We are talking about rooms filled with material, some of it very sensitive, some of which if released in the wrong circumstances would be outside of legislation. Some of it, if released in the wrong circumstances, could put lives at risk. There are serious questions about how evidence was handled. Some of it just went missing, leading to claims that there were people in Northern Ireland protected from prosecution because they were working as informants for the police or army. A few years ago, Lord Stevens, who led investigations into the security forces here, gave an indication of the extent of collusion within paramilitary groups at a parliamentary committee. When you talk about intelligence, of the 210 people we arrested, only three were not agents. Now, Lord Stevens has told the BBC’s Panorama that there were thousands of agents working within loyalist and republican gangs. They were recruited by MI5, the army and police Special Branch. Many were involved in criminality, including murder. There was impunity for these people to go on committing these crimes. Including murder? Including murder. Many of them were killers, and some were serial killers. The government says the vast majority of people who served in Northern Ireland did so with distinction, but time hasn’t removed the questions about collusion here. There are still state secrets about what was known and what was hidden. Chris Buckler, BBC News, Belfast. You can see that panorama specials this evening. Samples of live anthrax have mistakenly been sent by the American military to research laboratories in nine US states, and one facility in South Korea. Defence officials said the deadly material was intended for germ warfare training and was thought to be safe and inert. Steve Evans is in Seoul. What is being said about this where you are? There is concern from the people who are often concerned about the presence of American bases here. They are saying, we did not know about this institution which received this anthrax, and maybe we need to know more about it because there has been danger involved. This started with a laboratory in Utah on a military laboratory which a year ago started sending out anthrax to laboratories in the US and this big base in Korea, under the impression that the staff had been irradiated, made safe. It was discovered last week in a lab in the US but actually, it was not and it was highly toxic, highly dangerous. So then the whole batch was traced and some of it was sent on normal courier services across the globe. They have now discovered that there are 22 people in this country who may have come in contact with it, although the authorities they there are no symptoms of illness, and four people in the US. There is a bigger destination going on because clearly, if you send the contents of germ warfare through the normal delivery system on this planet, that is a serious breach of a policy. Research suggests that increasingly younger women are travelling from the west to join the jihadist group Islamic State in Syria. The independent think tank, the Institute of Strategic Dialogue, has also found that more professional women are joining the militants. It says that, as well as marrying fighters, they’re involved in propaganda and recruitment. Ben Geoghegan reports. These are two of the growing number of British recruits to the so-called Islamic State, or Isis. The twin sisters left their home in Manchester and travelled to Syria last summer. They are part of what today’s report describes as an unprecedented surge in womenjoining the jihadist group. They are lured by propaganda which promises them that they will have an instrumental role to play in a new society. They are being told they are helping build a utopian society. They are being told they will find belonging and strong sisterhood friendships. They are being told they will find romance with a strong jihadist husband and that their role will be to help the next-generation of this state. That is an extremely empowering message to give a woman. Today’s report says there are now up to 4000 Westerners fighting with so-called Islamic State, and among them over 550 are women, some as young as 13. Three other teenagers were caught on CCTV as they travelled to Syria from East London in February this year. But today’s report says female recruits also include adults with professional qualifications. The authors have monitored the online messages posted by women in Isis. They reveal that conditions are often difficult. Women are isolated. They sometimes live without water or electricity. Experts say those realities should act as a deterrent. There needs to be a counter narrative. The authorities need to focus more on the dissatisfaction and disillusionment people feel when they arrive in the land controlled by Islamic State. That is a fruitful counter narrative, the fact that people are going and not enjoying life there, that it is not all it has been made out to be in the propaganda, is powerful. The report says that with more women being radicalised, more women should be involved in tried to put a stop to it. Despite its name, the common dolphin was once a fairly rare sight in the waters off the west coast of Scotland, but now their numbers are increasing. Marine researchers are trying to find out why the dolphins are thriving in the Hebrides. john Maguire joined a scientific survey to find out more. From Tobermory on the Isle of Mull, we are heading out in search of cetaceans. Through the sea mist and the squalls, we are hoping to see them. But this is not a dolphin spotting trip for tourists. This is a scientific survey. You can’t guarantee certain species in certain spots. They move, food moves, the animals move to find the food. That is why the survey is important. We cover the whole area, notjust the areas of interest. We’re just about to deploy this underwater microphone. Below decks, they listen to the underwater world, trying to detect the distinctive clicks and squeals the animals use to navigate and communicate. Sighting, 20 degrees, 100m. The methodology has been honed over the past 13 years. And the data they gather helps scientists understand more about these mammals and this environment. Early 2000s, there weren’t many common dolphins here at all. Despite the name, they were not common. Every year since then, the numbers have been increasing by about 68%. This could be to do with climate change, we are not sure. But every decade the surface temperature in Scotland has been increasing by 0.5 degrees. Our monitoring will give us an understanding of what is happening. And whether it is a human disturbance that has caused this. The annual survey will run until October. The data from this ship and from volunteers onshore will be collated and analysed through the winter months. With each trip, each sighting, each dot on the chart, comes increased knowledge of these magnificent creatures. A privilege to see and our responsibility to protect. It began life as an automated telephone prompt. Then it became a prefix to a search term on social media. We’re talking about the hashtag. Apparently now, it’s being used more and more to add drama or expression in conversations, so much so that hashtag has been declared the ""children’s word of the year"" by the Oxford University Press. David Sillito explains! She then picked it up and ran out of the cave. The Kev exploded and she didn’t look back at it exploding, shejust kept walking didn’t look back at it exploding, she just kept walking forward. # supercool. Hashtag. It is something that started on social media, a means of organising conversation, sorting out topics. It has now become, with children, a new literary device to add a bit of colour and drama. The only thing I knew for sure was that I was going to get eaten. # frighten. What was once a little used symbol on the keyboard is everywhere, and in the 120,000 stories in the BBC’s 500 words competition, this new literary arrival appeared again and again. Hashtag is crowned the children’s word of the year. They are using it not as a prefix to a number or as a search item on Twitter. Infact, children don’t tweak that much. -- tweet. They are using it to build drama and suspense. Words linked to social media were everywhere, and it is changing fast. Facebook, e-mail, but pretty, all in decline. Rising fast, Snapchat. And if it is a choice of TV or phone, I got only one answer. Phone or television? Phone. You can live without the television? Phone or television? Phone. Do they know more than you? Children? 100%. Definitely. Are you feeling behind the times now? I feel old compared to what they come out with, and I am only ten years older. So, the computer hashtag, which began in the geeky world of 70s programming as a way of grouping topics, is now on its way to joining other punctuation marks as part of everyday writing. David Sillito, # feeling old. You’re watching the BBC News at One. Our top story today: Fifa president Sepp Blatter chairs an emergency meeting into the crisis engulfing his organisation, as pressure grows for him to resign. In a moment, we’ll have the weather, plus the news where you are. But first with the sport, here’s Hugh Woozencroft. Rory Mcllroy has made a shocking start to the Irish Open in County Down. The world number one finished his opening round last in the field this morning, scoring a 9-over par round of 80. Mcllroy hit five bogies on the front nine at his home tournament, nearly hitting the spectators on one occasion. He’s missed the cut in Ireland for the last two years, and looks likely to do so again this weekend. England’s Danny Willett is tied for the lead alongside Denmark’s Soren Kjeldsen. Both players shot rounds of 2-under par. Andy Murray is in action later at the French Open. He plays Portugal’sjoao Sousa in his second round match. He’s next on Philippe-Chatrier Court. This morning, Caroline Wozniacki crashed out in the second round. The Danish fifth seed but lost in straight sets to Germany’sjulia Goerges. British number one Heather Watson plays Sloane Stephens later. This weekend the world’s best heptahletes will be in the Austria for their annual meeting in the town of Gotzis. It’ll be jessica Ennis-Hill’s first Heptathlon since winning Gold at London 2012. Katarina johnson-Thompson isn’t going, but schoolgirl Morgan Lake will be there. She’s the rising star of British Heptathlon and if results as a junior are anything to go by she could be the best yet. jenna Hawkey has been to meet her. Like any A-level student sitting exams this summer, the next few months are important ones for Morgan Lake. But notjust crucial academically. She is the latest member of Great Britain’s talented heptathlete club, and juggling school and athletics isn’t always easy. I’m studying English, business and PE, and I like them all, but English is my favourite. And when Morgan doesn’t have her head on the books, you will find her here at the athletic Centre where she is coached by her father. She started quite early doing things that are five or six-year-old should be able to do in terms ofjumping and sprinting, so there was encouragement from myself and my wife, but also her saying, I want to do more, I want to do competitions. So we found the competitions and she did them. She should become parables are some of the best in the world in a few years. So the sky is the limit. Her mock exams came just after this year’s European indoor athletics Championships in Prague. While I ninth place finish was disappointing, the Austrian meeting is another chance for her to eat alongside the world’s best. And for Morgan, there is one key target. What is the dream for you? The Olympics. Possibly gold one day. So aim towards that. Morgan Lake ending that report. The football now. The Former Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez has moved a step closer to a surprise move to Real Madrid. Benitez has announced he’ll be leaving Italian club Napoli after two years in charge. Real President Florentino Perez confirmed talks with Benitez after he sacked the club’s head coach Carlo Ancelotti earlier this week. And in the last few minutes, the FA have confirmed that David Gill will not be taking his seat as Uefa’s representative on Fifa’s committee if Sepp Blatter wins the presidential election tomorrow. Who are we and where do we come from? A question which scientists believed was quite straightforward. Now it seems the human family tree is more complex than originally thought, with a new species of ancient human being found in Ethiopia. The remains date back as much as 3.5 million years, and have forced researchers to rethink what we know about early human history. Our science correspondent Rebecca Morelle has more. Meet the latest member of our family. This is Australopithecus deyiremeda, a species of early human that lived 3.5 million years ago. Its ancient remains were unearthed in the Afar region of Ethiopia. Palaeontologists found bones belonging to four individuals, and they’re unlike anything they have seen before. They have both ape and human-like features, with a strong jaw and small teeth. Their age means this is now one of potentially four different species of ancient humans alive at the same time. The most famous of these is Australopithecus afarensis, or Lucy. She was initially thought to be our direct ancestor, but this discovery suggests that the path to modern humans is more complex. We’re trying to look into which one of these species actually gave rise to our genus, homo. So it brings up a lot of questions and tells us that Australopithecus afarensis, or Lucy’s species, was not the only probable ancestor. The researchers are now hunting for more fossils. They want to find out how these different species lived together, and to determine which of these relatives was an evolutionary dead end and which one gave rise to us. Rebecca Morrell, BBC News. Now time for the weather with Emmrich. -- ben rich. On the satellite picture, you can see this cloud speeding across the Atlantic. This could provide some downpours that could be quite tricky to dodge tomorrow. You can see speckled cloud pushing across the Northwest, tickling Northern Ireland and Scotland. There could even be some thunder, a breezy, cool feel to the afternoon, as well. Some showers across northern England, maybe the odd light one, but generally speaking, the further south you are, are largely fine and dry afternoon with a decent amount of sunshine, still quite cool and breezy. This evening and tonight, the showers in northern and western areas will tend to gang together into something more like a persistent spell of rain, but all the while, it stays dry across the far south and east. A chilly night, temperatures of five or six, in the north, but staying mild across the South. Tomorrow will be a drench because of this developing weather front. Along this line, we will see some very heavy downpours, heavy rain, surface water and some very heavy downpours, heavy rain, surface waterand is rain, surface water and is Ray on the roads. And some squally, gusty winds. Some of that rain may get as far north as northern England, could even delay the start of the Test match at Headingley. But this afternoon, it will clear away, leaving a mixture of sunshine and showers. Temperatures generally 11-16 Celsius. What about the weekend? Saturday probably mainly fine and dry, but on Sunday, a very different story. It is going to be quite wet and windy. We begin the weekend with this very small, almost mini ridge of high pressure which is going to keep things fine initially. Saturday, not a bad day, but out west, more cloud spilling in. That rain moves eastwards during Saturday night into Sunday, so a wet start to Sunday. Tending to clear into the afternoon, with a fairly cool feel.

Fifa’s President Sepp Blatter has told the annual meeting of world football’s governing body that he won’t resign - despite calls for him to do so. Seven top Fifa officials were arrested in Zurich yesterday, among 14 people indicted by US prosecutors in world football’s worst ever corruption scandal. The head of Uefa, the European football governing body, Michel Platini, says he has asked Mr Blatter to resign. But the vote to elect a new Fifa president will go ahead tomorrow as planned, with Sepp Blatter seeking a fifth term. Here’s our Sports Editor Dan Roan. This report contains some flashing images. Having not been seen in public since Fifa was plunged into turmoil, finally, tonight, a glimpse of Sepp Blatter. The beleaguered President, opening world football’s annual Congress among more claims of corruption, but defying calls for him to step down. Many people hold me ultimately responsible for the actions and reputation of the global football community. We, or eye, cannot monitor everyone all of the time. It was yesterday’s dramatic arrests of senior football officials here in Zurich and benighted states that sparked the biggest crisis in Fifa’s history. The body is now the subject of two investigations by the FBI and the Swiss authorities, amid allegations of systematic bribery of the last 24 years. But instead of embarrassment, Sepp Blatter merely expressed concern. Actions of individuals have proven to bring shame and humiliation on football and demand action and change from us all. We cannot allow the reputation of football and Fifa to be dragged through the mud any longer. It has to stop here and now. Earlier, European football’s governing body ruled out seeking a postponement of tomorrow’s election, although Sepp Blatter was told to his face he must go. I said, Blatter was told to his face he must go. Isaid, you have to Blatter was told to his face he must go. I said, you have to leave. It was very sensitive. He said, it’s too late. He understood that it was too late. Why did you ask them to step down? We cannot continue like this with Fifa. But this goes way beyond foot four. The Prime Minister let it be known that he also wants a change at the top of the sport, but not all readers agree. In Russia, hosts of the next World Cup, some see this as an American conspiracy. TRANSLATION: One thing is clear, this has nothing to do with United States. If something did happen, did not happen on the territory of the United States. It is another attempt to extend theirjurisdiction to other countries. I have no doubt at all that it is a blatant attempt to prevent the real action of Sepp Blatter as President of Fifa, a clear violation of the way international organisations should function. Whatever the allegations, it seems certain that the alternative candidate could provide a much closer contest than anyone thought possible. Don’t be surprised if his opponent underlines tomorrow his status as a sport’s great survivor again. his status as a sport’s great survivoragain. Given survivor again. Given the unprecedented pressure that Sepp Blatter Phantom -- unprecedented pressure that Sepp Blatter Phantom -- find himself under, many would have found that brazen performance, presenting himself as the preferred candidate in the election, they will find it difficult to imagine how he can get another term difficult to imagine how he can get anotherterm in another term in office after so many scandal ridden years in charge. But many delegates will have found that classic virtuoso Sepp Blatter performance, they have shared in a huge financial success, when it comes to marketing and sponsorship deals that Sepp Blatter has presided overin deals that Sepp Blatter has presided over in 17 years in charge. That is why he remains the favourite to win the election and pull off the ultimate escape back once again. Fifa’s many sponsors and business partners may face huge damage to their brand, following the allegations of corruption. But are the risks of being associated with Fifa outweighed by the benefits of being associated with the World Cup - arguably the biggest event in sport? Here’s Robert Peston. Balletic beauty from Lionel Messi at the last World Cup Finals, so the likes of Adidas, Coke and McDonald’s thought they were buying reflected glory, from being allowed to market their brands there. But today they’re suffering reflected shame from the scandal at Fifa. The real worry for the primary sponsors is partly being associated with something which is becoming a joke in itself and is therefore negative to their brands, and some of these brands are now having very adverse things put on the internet, their logos are being ridiculed and messed around with. You know, it’s not helpful in that respect. Now, this lousy publicity hasn’t exactly come cheap for Fifa’s top six sponsors, multinational giants like Coca-Cola and Visa, which paid a total of £116 million every year to Fifa between 2011 and 2014 for the precious opportunity to promote their brands at the World Cup. That means each of them was, on average, paying around £20 million a year. And even the so-called second-tier sponsors, which include household names like McDonald’s and Budweiser, were paying around £14 million every year for what they now see as the dubious privilege of being associated with football’s governing body. Infact, Visa, the payments business, today said, our disappointment and concern with Fifa in light of the day’s development is profound. It’s important that Fifa makes changes now. Should Fifa fail to do so, we’ve informed them that we will reassess our sponsorship. The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport... Which drew this response from the British Government. It is important that other sponsors reflect on their links to Fifa and consider following Visa’s lead. For sponsors like the maker of this advert, McDonald’s, the bell tolling. But although corporate sponsors hate the taint from Fifa, they fear the potential costs of cancelling their contracts with it, and they also love how the World Cup gives them a global captive audience. But what if one or two sponsors did show Fifa the red card and stop paying all that cash? Well, I’m told Fifa could easily replace them, so collective action by most sponsors may be required if they really want a genuinely beautiful game. Robert Peston, BBC News. David Cameron has begun a diplomatic tour of Europe, to try to build support among other leaders in the run up to Britain’s in-out referendum. Today, Downing Street confirmed the question that will be put to voters - we’ll be asked to vote yes or no to the UK remaining a member of the EU. From Paris, where the Prime Minister has been meeting President Hollande, Lucy Williamson reports. Sometimes, all that is required to crack a nut is a little pressure. David Cameron says he has 27 nuts to crack, one for each of the EU member states. Mr Cameron began his tour today in the Hague. To avoid a British exit from the EU he says he needs to change the group’s core treaty, something few other European leaders want. We will be talking about European reform, the need forflexibility, the need to focus on growth and jobs. Mr Cameron wants reform in order to guarantee certain powers for the UK. A four year delay in benefits for new migrants, a UK opt out from the goal of ever closer union and protection for the single market. Despite treating President Hollande to lunch at a proper British pub last year, his plan has been given the brush off by the French leader who said, at the time, it was not a priority. Since then, the gap between Paris and London seems to have widened. David Cameron arrived in France this afternoon with the text of a future British referendum playing in his head, should the UK remain in the European Union. At the Frog & Roastbeef pub in Paris, we found one Frog and one Roastbeef with little appetite for compromise. I think it would make a big difference if Germany was leaving the European Community. But not England. I’m all for opting out, to be honest. We can’t bail everybody out, we are a very, very small country and I think we’ve got... Charity begins at home, my gran used to say, and I think that is what we’ve got to really look at. But strong economic ties between Britain and France are a big incentive to find a solution. David Cameron has often talked about the need for treaty change. France has been equally clear it’s a step too far. Privately, there is likely to be more room and more appetite for compromise. But for any change to EU protocols, Mr Cameron will need the agreement of all 27 member states, and that’s a formidable task. Paris is famous for its bridges. Spanning the troubled waters of Europe’s new landscape may take just as much heavy lifting and not look as pretty. Lucy Williamson, BBC News, Paris. The Methodist Church has apologised after an investigation it commissioned found nearly 2,000 claims of sexual or physical abuse. Allegations date back as far as the 1950s and involve church ministers as well as employees of the church and volunteers. Our special correspondent Lucy Manning reports. The Methodist Church - a place of prayer, but it’s also been one of abuse, nearly 2000 abusers or suspected ones in the Church. Frank, not his real name, was sexually abused at a Methodist school. His abusers are not longer alive. His words have been re-voiced to protect his identity. Ijust hated every minute of it. If I remember rightly, it always happened on a Thursday night. The teacher involved would come into my dormitory in his dressing gown and shout my name, and I would be taken to his room, where I was probably there for 15, 20, 25 minutes per time. For the incoming leader of the Methodist Church, there is shame they have not cared for the most vulnerable. The Church says sorry to the people who have been the survivors of abuse. The Church bitterly regrets that it has not always acted in a way to ensure that that abuse was identified and was dealt with appropriately. The review looked at the Church from the 1950s until last year and found there are still some concerns about more than 600 people, including 100 ministers. New information has led to six current police investigations. People didn’t always listen to survivors, victims of abuse, and if they listened, they didn’t always take the right action. Sometimes it was too difficult for them to hear what was being said. For Frank and other survivors, the Methodists’ review and apology is welcome. I have to respect them for being honest. I think, for 46 years, I thought nobody would believe me, but now they have come out and admitted it did take place. They can’t turn the clock back, but I admired them greatly for putting their hands up. The Methodist Church contacted current and former ministers, questionnaires were sent out, members were also asked for information. Now the question is being asked why other religions can’t be as open about the scale of abuse in their congregations. For Ann Lawrence, a survivor of abuse in the Catholic Church and now a member of the Methodist Church, there must be more transparency. We’ve seen in the Church of England, the Catholic Church a great reluctance to be open about the findings of their past case reviews. They haven’t shared with the public or with their own churches and church members the failings that happened and took place within their institutions. We’ve also not seen anything coming from Muslim communities, jewish communities, Sikh communities, Hindu communities. Survivors still feel other faiths have much to do. Lucy Manning, BBC News. A year-long study into the contamination of shop-bought raw chickens has found that nearly three quarters tested positive for the food poisoning bug Campylobacter. About one in five chickens were found to contain the highest rate of the bacteria - which causes an estimated 250,000 cases of food poisoning every year. Here’s our business correspondent Emma Simpson. Steph Hartley is back at work, just. She needs a taxi to get there. She got Campylobacter at a music festival last summer, which triggered something far worse. It started with weakness in my feet, which spread my legs, which spread up into my body, into my arms, my face, my breathing. Steph spent five months in hospital with a neurological condition, a very rare, unlucky consequence of this food poisoning bug. I can’t quite believe that, looking back, that it’sjust because I ate some chicken. Campylobacter is a naturally occurring bacteria, commonly found in chickens. Way too many of them, says the Food Standards Agency. After a year’s worth of sampling, it found that just over 70% of fresh chickens tested positive for Campylobacter and 19% were highly contaminated. It was even higher at Asda, with nearly 30%, the worst performer. Tesco came out top, atjust under 13%. They are unacceptable levels, they are still far too high on chickens and the industry needs to do a lot more. It’s not fair on the consumer to have to shoulder all the risk. Chicken. It is our most popular meat. We eat the equivalent of 25 million birds a week. Today’s figures show that Campylobacter is just a big a problem as it has always been, but these tests have forced the supermarkets to act. For instance, chickens are being sold in oven ready bags and, at this processing plant, birds are rapidly chilled to reduce contamination. Some supermarkets are already seeing promising results. We’re working across the board, as an industry, with poultry processors, with the Food Safety Agency and with farmers, and everybody else concerned, to ensure that we bring about a solution to this as quickly as possible. There is no quick fix, but the FSA believes the figures will finally started to improve in the coming months. the figures will finally start to There isn’t any risk, though, if your chicken is properly prepared and cooked.

A series of fresh train strikes is called - A series of fresh train strikes is called - starting next week. We’ll have all the details. And the boy with leukaemia getting his very own lesson in medicine. A BBC investigation has discovered that British security forces had thousands of undercover agents and informants working inside paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland. The undercover operatives were recruited by the army, MI5 and Special Branch, and many were involved in criminality and murder. The Government says collusion with paramilitaries should never happen, and that it has apologised where it did. Our Ireland correspondent Chris Buckler reports. The state still holds secrets from a time of terror, a period when paramilitaries left life in Northern Ireland anything but normal. And among those behind the balaclavas were agents and informants for MI5, the army and the police. ARCHIVE: Constable McMurray is the first member of the security forces to be murdered in Northern Ireland this year... Colleen McMurray was murdered in Newry by the IRA in 1992, killed when a mortar bomb was fired directly at the patrol car she was sitting in. Her wedding ring was on herfinger, and we always said never to take our wedding rings off. And Ijust concentrated, spoke more or less to it, rather than to her face, because she was quite badly injured. Her murder isjust one of many killings where there are allegations of collusion, cases where it’s claimed that British agents working inside paramilitary were involved. I believe that agent has been protected over a number of years, notjust, you know, in relation to that crime, but in relation to other crimes. The BBC’s Panorama programme has spoken to Peter Keeley, who acted as a state agent within the IRA. They’ve agreed not to show his face, but he insists he warned of an attack ahead of Constable McMurray’s murder. He says he wasn’t directly involved but he did help develop the device that was used in the bombing. I got a few people caught and jailed. Did you save lives? Absolutely, yeah. Did you take life? It has been alleged. I can’t answer that question, because there’s ongoing police investigations. Lord Stevens, who led a government inquiry into collusion, has told Panorama that he believes there were thousands of agents and informants operating inside loyalist and republican gangs, and many were involved in criminality, including murder. Many of them were killers, and some of them serial killers. That does leave difficult questions about the price paid for information from inside paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland. Was the cost life, and are people still being protected from prosecution? And you can see the Panorama special this evening, Britain’s Secret Terror Deals, tonight on BBC One at nine o’clock. An international summit to discuss the migrant crisis in South East Asia begins in Thailand tomorrow. 25,000 people are estimated to have set sail from the Bay of Bengal in the first three months of this year alone. They’re hoping to reach Malaysia, and about half of them come from Bangladesh. justin Rowlatt has travelled to Teknaf on the country’s southern coast, from where migrants make the perilous journey in search of a better life. He sent us this report. This is where many of the migrants’ treacherousjourneys begin, on the coast of southern Bangladesh. Driven by desperation, drawn by the hope of a better life, they set out into the surf of the Bay of Bengal. You really get a sense ofjust how dangerous these journeys can be. Coming out on small boats, the migrants are packed in here and taken out to the deep ocean. Whoa. .. Whoa! That is where they meet the big boats, the trawlers that are going to take them on the 1500 km, 1000 mile journey all the way down to the coast of Thailand. These women’s husbands left for Malaysia together a year ago. Neither woman has seen their husbands since. TRANSLATION: My husband used to say, I pray that I make it to Malaysia, I will earn and send home money so you can eat proper food and educate the children. TRANSLATION: Many people from this area have gone, men who didn’t use to earn a single rupee here in Bangladesh are now sending home thousands every month. That’s why I sent him. We managed to meet one of the man who organised this trade in people. He confirmed what many migrants had told us, that they know when they leave that theirjourney will end in a prison camp. Migrants pay a small upfront fee, knowing they’ll only be released when the big money, £1,500, is paid. Before they leave here, we tell them, if you don’t pay, you will be put in prison. You won’t get any rice, and you’ll die of hunger. If you pay, you’ll be able to leave for Malaysia with honour. It is a measure of how desperate the people here are that so many still want to go. And so many people go missing. We visited an unofficial settlement of Rohingya Muslim refugees who fled persecution in neighbouring Myanmar. Within minutes, people began to bring pictures of missing relatives. Even when someone does make it to Malaysia, the torment isn’t necessarily over. Tahira Begum is calling her 14-year-old son. He travelled to Malaysia without her permission last year. He is earning some money, but his parents are saddled with huge debts, and his mother misses him terribly. justin Rowlatt, BBC News. Prince William has admitted that he would prefer his children to follow in his footsteps in their choice of football team. In an interview with the BBC, the Prince joked that he would like Prince George tojoin him in the terraces of Villa Park. How long do you think it will be before you take Prince George to his first football match? I don’t know, I’ll pass that to the missus, see how long I get away with! But at the moment being only 22 months is a little bit... It’s a bit early, are you going to encourage them to be Aston Villa fans, or do you think you are going to say, let’s give them a team at the top they can cheer on a little bit more in big finals like this? The responsible thing would be to let him make his own mind up, but I think I might be quite biased!

The UK’s most prestigious art award, the Turner Prize, is to be staged in Hull, during its year as City of Culture in 2017. Work is already under way to regenerate parts of the city. Arts editor Will Gompertz has been finding out about the preparations. And I ring my bell! And I very loudly, proudly yell, you can all go to Hull! Kingston-upon-Hull! The Turner Prize is coming in 2017, when Hull becomes UK City of Culture. OK, it does look a little tired in places today, but it’s having a £100 million makeover and will be transformed, the council says, into a vibrant, creative cultural centre. I know a lot of people who’ve moved out of city... Local theatre director Madeleine O’Reilly took me on a tour of a city preparing for its moment in the spotlight. This is Humber Street, which is going to be one of the main kind of arts, cultural areas in Hull for 2017. It seems pretty derelict at the moment. It is at the moment, but what they’re going to do, or what I’ve been told they’re going to do, is there going to keep, like, these original facades, bring out the cobbles that were originally here, so pay and honour the past of it. Good place for a studio for you? Yeah, I think so, I’d like to, hint, hint! Currently we’ve got a building site, it’s going to be a digital hub, and then behind it it’s going to be an amphitheatre. At the moment it’s a dry dock. And amphitheatre? Yeah. We’re just on the edges of old town, which is also going to get a makeover. Yes, it is, this is Holy Trinity Church, they are going to stretch this out into a piazza area. It does need some TLC. It does, the main thing is that Hull is a night-time place, it does shut down at six o’clock at night, but hopefully this will bring people into the city centre on a night-time and celebrate the city’s history and future. Is spending big money on a year of culture a good investment? Will it change the city? Of course it will. Very good idea. It puts Hull on the map. I have heard they are going to do a open theatre, which will be brilliant! I think Hull is a fantastic place, I don’t know why people think it is the end of the world. The actor Sir Tom Courtenay, born and bred in Hull, think the city’s unassuming nature will work in its favour. It has got no pretensions, which makes it useful for no pretensions, which makes it usefulfor a cultural no pretensions, which makes it useful for a cultural place, usefulfor a cultural place, you know, because culture you expect retention, and Hull hasn’t got any. This is a city full of character and characters, determined to take a chance to re-establish itself as a thriving hub of contemporary Britain. Will Gompertz, BBC News, Hull. A quick look out into the Atlantic sees a mass of cloud heading our way which will bring wind and rain overnight and into tomorrow.

It stays largely dry for East Anglia and the south-east, nine orten largely dry for East Anglia and the south-east, nine or ten in the south, but through the morning, still the potential for some showers to be on the heavy side. Cool and breezy, blustery start to the day, maybe not too many showers to the eastern side of Scotland. Northern Ireland, northern England, showers becoming more persistent, a miserable start for Manchester, a cross towards Nottingham, not good across much of the Midlands, Wales and the south-west, wet and windy. That rain is on the move through the morning, so behind it something brighter coming through, but that rain will be heavy as it makes its way eastwards, gusty winds around, unpleasant conditions towards East Anglia and the south-east. That rain is on the move, behind it something brighter coming through, still some showers around, mostly on the M4 corridor and northwards.

Those rules allowed thousands of low-skilled workers from eastern European countries to come here. And, in some cases, they end up sleeping rough. Now, BBC London has uncovered a new trend. Scores of people bedding down in makeshift camps along canals and the river in the capital. Gareth Furby is on the Grand Union canal now. Yes, have a look at the canal. It looks really nice, doesn’t it? The kind of place you might want to spend a nice evening. But look over here. Not so far away and what have we got? just one of the camps that have been springing up along the canal. The canal authorities are saying they are now no longer prepared to tolerate this. We are following a team targeting rough sleepers on London’s canal network. How long have you been sleeping here? And sleeping in the tiny space here on the Regents Canal are for men. Iraq. Do you want to stay in the UK? He says he is an Iraqi refugee and has lived under the bridge for a few months. Why do you have to live here? Nojob or home. The team which moves on to the Grand Union Canal... Every time, we find a few more people. They are offering temporary accommodation or even the chance of a bust drink -- temporary accommodation or even the chance of a bust drink -- trip home. This man is from Bulgaria and says he will be travelling home himself in a few days. He said he thinks 50 people sleep here. But we have no idea. On this stretch, there are several camps. Chances are these GUYS several camps. Chances are these guys have gone out five -- several camps. Chances are these guys have gone out five -- first thing and found some work but they’ve left a real mess here. This is a toilet area full. This is... What’s wrong? It’sjust is a toilet area full. This is... What’s wrong? It’s just disgusting. And then they found two Romanians who do want help. They had made themselves a shelter out of tree branches. They had just ten pounds between them. Is this your home? Yes. He said he is called Christian and can’t afford a tent. Did you make it yourself? Yes. How long did it take? Two days. It’s shocking that people... It is caveman standards by any stretch of the imagination. The two men agreed to spend the night in a bed-and-breakfast and may go back home with their bus fare paid for this weekend. But late last night we joined the team again in North London. And they found another for men, again Romanians, who’d only just arrived. And they said they want to stay. This man called Robert said it was hidden. They had got used to it and it was close to a place where they’d got work as building contract does. It is not safe here. There are flies and it’s cold. You know. They have a whole bed here. We will inform the Council and the landowners will be informed as well. But the men said they wanted to stay for a month or more and if more efforts are made to move on they could just go elsewhere. This attempt to move rough sleepers of the London canals may not be easy. Of course, images like those we’ve seen in Gareth’s report are nothing new. Over the past two years, BBC London has filmed in the capital and in Romania, detailing the plight of the Roma and of Romanians who’ve come here looking for a better life and ended up on the streets. Do you believe you can stay on the streets? The issue first came to light in April 2013 when Roma rough sleepers turned up in Park Lane. Take your belongings over there as soon as possible, please. Three months later they were targeted by Westminster Council and the border force, offering them free tickets to go home. He is going back to nothing but do nothing here is better. One charity says its helped close to 3,000 eastern Europeans return home this way. In October that year, we followed some of those who’d gone back home to Romania. It was ten times better being in London. But the Roma community aren’t alone in finding work hard to come by in London. We filmed with Romanian labourers queueing for cash-in-hand work in North London. MY My boss was paying me £37 50 a day. I worked from 9:30am to Apm. And with low wages have come living conditions like this. We carried the road on a bike and used tree branches -- We carried the road on a bike and used tree branches -- we carried would on our back. And under the North Circular in Edmonton, a camp they called the Fortress. We can barely get to sleep for more than three orfour We can barely get to sleep for more than three or four hours. The only way in... A self built ladder in the middle of the busy road. Well, let’s go back to Gareth now. You’ve reported on this story from the beginning. Has anything changed over the past few years? What terms Reach is telling us is that almost 3000 people have taken UP that almost 3000 people have taken up the offer of a free coach ride home -- up the offer of a free coach ride home -- the Thames Reach. But it doesn’t stop other people coming back and if this isn’t taken down they will come back here and take over these tents. So some people are saying is that the only solution will come from politicians as it is a political issue. Gareth, David Cameron is on tour speaking to European leaders and he has put immigration and movement of labour central to that, hasn’t he? Yes, he is taking up this issue and is touring Europe looking for support from European leaders for this idea that there has to be a change which allows the principle of freedom of movement to be amended so that if you are not skilled and you will end up in a situation like this, something can be done to stop you coming here. Of course, it is difficult as it goes to the core principle of the European Union -- union, the freedom of movement. Lots more to come. Including: I am at a school in Stamford Hill. Mothers here have been told their children could be banned if they drive them to class. Three East London teenagers who travelled to Syria are said to have made contact with relatives saying they are safe and well. The solicitor for the three families also says the girls are no longer staying together as a trio. The development comes as researchers in the capital claim the women travelling tojoin the jihadi group, Islamic State, are getting younger. Our home affairs correspondent, Nick Beake, reports. After three months of silence, the three girls have finally made contact with their families. They flew from Gatwick during their brief half turned -- flew from Gatwick during their brief half turned -- half term to get to Syria. They have told relatives they are safe. The family’s solicitor told us what he knew. A couple of girls have contacted their parent recently. They have confirmed their safe, well and it doesn’t appear that they are coming back to the UK in the near future. that they are coming back to the UK in the nearfuture. A new report today claims there has been a surge in young womenjoining IS. They are being told they are helping to build a utopian society and that they will find belonging and strong sisterhood friendships, that they will find romance with a jihadist husband and their role is to help in the next generation of this state so it is an empowering message. Researchers at King’s College London estimate there are up to 4000 Westerners fighting with IS and hundreds are women, some as young as 13. But there is a warning that women with professional qualifications are also been recruited. Last month, one of the Bethnal Green girls tweeted that she had enjoyed a takeaway meal, but today’s report said other women who have joined IS have sent messages that there is often no water or relic visited and that women are often isolated. Authorities need to focus more on the disillusionment people feel when they arrive in the land controlled by IS because it is a fruitful counter narrative. The fact that people are not enjoying life there is really powerful. Today’s report says more British women need to be involved in tackling the changing face of radicalism. A new series of rail strikes have been announced starting next week. The RMT has confirmed its members will walk as part of its ongoing dispute over pay. Alpa Patel has been following this and joins us now. First of all, what are the dates we’re talking about? Well, there was relief at the beginning of the week when a 24hr strike for the Bank Holiday was called off The plan would be for strike action to take place next Thursday for 24 hours, starting at 5pm and ending the Friday at 5pm. And then that will be followed by a 48-hour walkout from 5pm on Tuesday 9th june until Thursday the Iithjune again starting at 5pm. This would also include overtime bans and not attending call-outs. That means that if there’s signalling problems, for instance, staff will not attend, causing more disruption to passengers. What are the all sides saying? Well, I’ve just got back from speaking to the RMT. They say this all came about after they put the improved offer made by Network Rail and led to last Monday’s strike being called off. That was put to their members and they said it wasn’t good enough. Here’s what Mick Cash, the General Secretary of the RMT, had to say. We are trying to get a read -- reasonable settlement for workers who feel angry either way they’ve been treated by Network Rail. We have been trying to get a deal for over six months. It’s the first time in years we’ve had a strike and it’s because they’re prepared to pay bonuses to senior management -- managers but not reward properly the safety critical staff. Network Rail have responded saying they are ready to get around the table with whoever the RM T feels can speak on the behalf of members. The RMT says they are ready to take part in any talks Network Rail are ready to hold but no dates are pencilled in. Thanks very much. Former Respect MP George Galloway has announced he’s running for Mayor of London. Declaring himself as a candidate on Twitter, he posted the message alongside a picture, showing him with his son. The controversial politician confirmed he’ll stand after losing his Commons seat of Bradford West in the general election. Leaders of a Hasidicjewish group in north London has threatened to ban pupils whose mothers drive them to school. In a letter sent out last week, Belz rabbis said that having female drivers goes against"" the traditional values of modesty."" The group runs two schools in Stamford Hill. Well, Katharine Carpenter is there for us now.What exactly did the letter say? It was sent out by rabbis from the Orthodox community here in Stamford Hill. They run two schools. The first is this girls School, a fee-paying independent school and they run a boys school a few minutes away. The message was clear. It simply said there had Dean and increase in incidence of women driving their children to the school and they said it caused resentment among other parents and it warned that from August any children whose mothers had driven them to school could be banned. It’s believed this is the first time this kind of direct lift has been issued in the UK and thejewish Chronicle said it would worry many in the community. It’s the first time we’ve seen something like this and it is very unusual in the city community. You see women driving here and women play an active role in the community, whether it is in schools or setting up charities or running events. What have other people been saying? Well, there has been a great deal of surprise and in some cases anger. One progressive rabbi said she feared this smacked of religious fundamentalism where outdated views were being used to rid press women. It is wrong -- were being used to rid press women. It is wrong-- repress women. It doesn’t have any basis in women’s Law. It is an excuse for a time where women can be controlled and children are connected from the point of view where they cannot go to school if their man is seen driving so it’s outrageous. It has been difficult to gauge any reaction from the women and, but having contacted the school, I got a statement sent to me. It remains to be seen whether any pupils will be barred and if they are whether the government might step in. Many people feel the policy, in reality, is unworkable.

He had a ruptured aorta. Doctors at the urgent care centre misdiagnosed it as a slipped disc and they sent him home with painkillers. The next day, his sister found him dead at his home in Wandsworth. He was a very gracious gentleman. He’d been out sailing. He grabbed life with both hands and lived it. To have him suddenly taken away, turned off like that, is extraordinarily difficult. It doesn’t sink in. It will probably start to sink in now. The coroner recorded a narrative verdict saying he died after a certain -- series of system failings which led to his high blood pressure going and recognised and treated. Add any changes being made as a result of this? Yes, the Imperial health care trust which runs Charing Cross and other hospital says major changes have been made in accident and emergency department and everyone will have basic check. Tonight, the family says this is of some comfort to them and they hope no one else will ever have too suffer the way they have. Thank you. This is Henry and he likes playing cricket and on his computer, but, unlike most children of his age, he is being treated for leukaemia. When he told the wanted to know exactly what happened to his blood when it was sent for analysis they decided to show him. |,m I’m eightand I’m eight and I’m being treated for leukaemia. Henry has been fighting acute leukaemia for five years and has had to deal with some pretty nasty but life-saving chemotherapy is. He still managed to go to school and do as much as he could. It is a normal life except for when you first get it you feel tired. For now, the worst may be over but he is still undergoing treatment and he must get his blood taken by a nurse at least once a week. I usually feel a bit of pressure but other than that it’s fine. For the first time, Henry and his family were invited to see what happens to his blood at the lab in north London. Hundreds of blood tests are analysed every day but for anyone with leukaemia, it’s even more important to keep an eye on things. We have to check his platelets and haemoglobin. It is important because if the chemotherapy knocks out to many, he won’t be able to fight infection. So, while Henry and his brother will suss out what happening behind the microscope, his mother also get some reassurance. They tell as if he has enough immunity this week so then we can go swimming and do things we normally do. So, what did Henry and his brother make of it all? The cult make his body worse and then he gets it with the cold. Looking in the microscope was my favourite bit. Henry is hoping to make a school project of his trip to the lag -- lab, but he will still have to have his blood monitored. From the pigs over Battersea Power Station to the school in Islington where they filmed the video for Another Brick in the Wall, Pink Floyd has been part of London’s musical landscape for 50 years. Today they were honoured at the place where it all began. And our entertainment correspondent, Brenda Emmanus, was there. As bands go, they don’t come much better than -- As bands go, they don’t come much better than -- bigger than Pink Floyd. The two men who founded the group were back at the Polytechnic where it started 50 years ago, unveiling a heritage plaque in their honour. Ourvery unveiling a heritage plaque in their honour. Our very first day here, influential bands in the world. They formed here. They were architecture students here rehearsing in the tea room in the basement. How good where you then? Good. As a band? Well, put it like this, if we’d gone up for Britain’s Got Talent I don’t think we’d have made it past the audition stage! No. The band had been through a series of name changes before settling for Pink Floyd. In the early days, it was psychedelic rock and over five decades their massive live shows help them sell 250 million records and more worldwide. Did you always recognise you had a pioneering sound? No. In all bands, it’s a question of having someone in the band who can write songs. Without that, we would definitely have disappeared into the cracks... In the architectural... In the architectural school. The Wall documentary is to be screened for one night only this September. Their commitment to their music is still evident and now their legacy has been set in stone. And now let us get a check on the weather. There are some serious downpours we will have to dodge tomorrow. Some quite a street whether as well. If not -- it quite a street whether as well. If not-- it won’t be all day long. The rain at the moment is out in the Atlantic. That is tomorrow’s wet weather. The cloud is quite well broken this evening so quite a decent evening with clear spells overnight. Temperatures not dropping too far. Tomorrow, a fine start and maybe early brightness but cloud will gather through the morning with splashes of rain and the main event arrives at lunchtime. Downpours will work their way across the area and we could see an hour or so of extremely heavy rain at lunchtime and strong and gusty winds which will not be pleasant. By the end of the afternoon, things clear up nicely. A cool deal to the day. In the evening, if you showers and sunny spells. Clear spells overnight which takes us into a weekend of two halves. Saturday is the better day with decent amounts of sunshine and rightness. Not particularly warm, but it will feel fairly pleasant. Sunday morning, though, heavy rain clears and things should be brighter in the afternoon. Serious downpours to be dodged, but sunshine also. Thank you. The president of the has refused to resign despite pressure asking him to do so. David Cameron is in Paris for the second stage of his whistle-stop tour of four European capitals. He hopes to persuade European leaders of reform on European membership. I will be back later but, for now, have a lovely evening. Hello and welcome to the One Show with Matt Baker... And Alexjones. As you may have seen, the latest in attention grabbing in-flight safety videos has hit the news this week. They’ve gone from Hobbit characters and child rappers to comedy cats and a smoking goat. ~ I hate it when you get smoking goats on planes. There is nothing worse, is there? The trend has divided opinion with some saying it risks blurring the serious safety message, others believe if its engaging then it’s doing itsjob. So unbeknown to our audience we thought we’d try something similar out on them. This is the actual One Show safety briefing that happened just before we came on air courtsey of a - rather angry - Greg Davies. Listen up, I know what you’re thinking, it’s the One Show, we’re here to have a lovely warm time. You’re not, you’re here to be safe and abide by the rules. There are fire exit everywhere, use your brain, follow everybody else out if there’s a fire. There are cables all over the floor, do not trip over the cables. If you see the camera moved about, be sensible, think, you haven’t got hard hats, you will get knocked out. Al Pacino will be on video, I will not have screaming! The FA Cup will be in the room, do not touch the FA Cup, it does not belong to you. Are you listening to me, kid? Yeah. Ifa guest belong to you. Are you listening to me, kid? Yeah. If a guest makes a joke, laugh and clap, what do you do? Laughed and clapped. The Gurkhas are here, don’t make me use them on you. You heard him, laugh and clap, Greg Davies! Were little lad. I’m so sorry about that, he was winding me up, that kid. No, he was lovely. You don’t strike me as somebody safety conscious. Correct. Are you accident prone? I’ve been on air two Are you accident prone? I’ve been on airtwo minutes and Are you accident prone? I’ve been on air two minutes and realised when I sat down and that this shirt is too tight for me, I’m having to hold my stomach in the next half an hour. And I am holding it in, that’s the amazing thing, if I let it go there would be serious danger to people in this room. We are in firing range of those buttons, be careful. Boom, boom, boom! The The Band of The Brigade of Gurkhas are here and we have a special appearance is from Al Pacino, can you believe it? If we get round to it, we could talk about the second series of Man Down. Good, you know that’s why I’m here, right? First, as the Queen ‘s speech confirmed yesterday, there will be an EU referendum by the end of 2017. But 16 and 17-year-olds will not be allowed to vote. So if most of us are going to get the chance to vote, how much do we actually know about how it stands now? And do we know any more than those not allowed to vote - the inbetweeners? Lucy Siegle put it to the test. Ten questions, five minutes, no confirming, you may turn over your papers now. Not five, what did you have? Six. 12. How many member states? You said 17. It’s 28. When is your update? August? No, it’s the 9th of May. How many seats? It’s actually 73. 503 million. 1973is 1973 is the correct answer. ~ Ididn’t I didn’t think it was as much as that. What scores did you get? Two. Three. 50%? Four out of ten. Pleased? Could have been worse. Two out of ten? I didn’t know I knew as much as I thought I did. Not pleased with yourself? I am 16. I think we should have the right to vote because we are the future generation and the ones who will be impacted by it the most. How old are you? Wynne 16. Do you think it is important you should vote on the EU? As a 16 about? No, Idon’t should vote on the EU? As a 16 about? No, I don’t think I’m old enough. I don’t think many people my age care or would vote. Probably know more about celebrities than my own country, which is bad. Beyonce I would have got all of them right, literally all of them. What do you think, Greg? Sorry? About Beyonce. Should 16 and 17-year-olds be allowed to vote? There is a serious discussion here about engaging young people with politics and young people feeling like their voices are heard. So there is a serious debate to be had. There is a but coming. Would I have let my 16-year-old self vote? No, Iwouldn’t have Would I have let my 16-year-old self vote? No, I wouldn’t have given him a knife and fork. We’ve got an alternative European Union quiz, we’ll do one question. This is going to be humiliating. It’s on topic. According to the rest of the world, which EU country was voted the least funny in 2011? Oh my goodness, I mean the stereotypical answer is Germany, so I’m not going to go there. Are you sure? LAUGHTER I would go there. Dol there. Are you sure? LAUGHTER I would go there. Do I get a prize? No. You can have a photo of the FA Cup. I know some very funny Germans, it’s a terrible stereotype. We know some very funny Brits, where do you think they came? Are we bad? Least funny, yes. Second? We were forth. You need to brush -- funny, yes. Second? We were forth. You need to brush -- push us up this list. Kids, go into serious professions. Not everybody wants a new supermarket in their town in fear of destroying the high Street and putting shops out of business. But are they right to be worried? Nick Wallis has been to Sheringham on the North Norfolk Coast to find out. In this picture postcard seaside town, shoppers are out in force, with many of them heading to the new Tesco. But it’s no ordinary Tesco, for an epic 17 years this was the town that told the supermarket giant to stay off their patch. Going to kill our town, the greengrocers. It will make a difference. Tesco won the day and it has been opened 18 months. It looks like the independent retailers in Sheringham are doing roaring trade as well, were the prophets of doom mistaken? I know lots of people around my age who work there, so it has created a lot ofjob opportunities. Some people oppose it, smaller shopkeepers, but it’s given the local people and tourists more ",,
134,BBC1 London,28-may-2015,BBC News at Ten,22:00,25 mins,True,"FIFA’s President Sepp Blatter says he won’t resign - despite the corruption allegations engulfing football’s world governing body. He tells its annual meeting that he can’t monitor everyone all the time - and that individuals have brought shame on the game. We cannot allow the reputation of football to be dragged through the mud, it has to stop here and now. Tonight a leading African delegate tells us Blatter is still the right man for the job. Also on the programme: David Cameron’s latest European charm offensive is underway - trying to win reforms before Britain’s EU referendum. The treacherous journey risked by thousands of migrants from Bangladesh, seeking a better life - we have a special report. Can Britain still afford to buy America’s latest jump jet fighters for our aircraft carriers? we’re on board for a special report. A positive step forward for the F-35, a jet that’s been plagued by problems. Later on BBC London. Rail commuters face three days of strikes after the RMT rejects the latest pay offer from Network Rail. And the immigrants sleeping rough next to canals and rivers, Good evening. In a defiant performance, FIFA’s President Sepp Blatter has told the annual meeting of world football’s governing body that he won’t resign - and that he’s the man to clean up the organisation, after several executives were arrested for corruption. Tonight he’s received backing from fellow delegates - the head of Nigerian football has told the BBC he’s confident that Blatter will be re-elected as Fifa president tomorrow. Here’s our Sports Editor Dan Roan. It contains flash photography. Having not been seen in public since Fifa was plunged into turmoil, finally, a glimpse of Sepp Blatter. Opening football’s annual congress, defying mounting calls to step down. Many hold me ultimately responsible for the actions and the reputation of the global footballing community, we, or I, cannot monitor everyone all of the time. Yesterday’s dramatic arrests, of football officials amid bribery charges sparked the biggest crisis in Fifa’s history but Blatter merely expressed concern. Actions of individuals, bring shame and humiliation on football and demand action and change from us all. We cannot allow the reputation of football and Fifa to be dragged through the mud any longer. It has to stop here and now. As he spoke, protesters outside of the venue made clear their opposition. But within the Fifa family, many are loyal ahead of the presidential election. Who are you voting for tomorrow? Sepp Blatter. Why? Blatterfeels voting for tomorrow? Sepp Blatter. Why? Blatter feels Africa. Why? Blatterfeels Africa. He has impacted so much. You know a lot of developmental programmes, a lot of... We think without Blatter, we would not enjoy the benefits we enjoy today. Prince Ali now believes he has a real chance of ousting Blatter, he has the support of the Go earn body, UEFA telling Blatter to his face, he has to go. I said you had to leave. He was sensitive on that. He said it was too late. He understood. Why did you ask him to step down? We cannot continue like this with Fifa. Today, the Prime Minister let it be known he wants Blatter out but not all agree. known he wants Blatter out but not allagree. In Russia, hosts known he wants Blatter out but not all agree. In Russia, hosts of the next World Cup, they some see this as an American conspiracy. It isjust another as an American conspiracy. It is just another attempt to extent the jurisdiction to other countries. I have no doubt it is an attempt to prevent the re-election of Blatter as President of Fifa, a clear violation of way that international organisations should function. This week provided a lot more than mere entertainment for the Fifa delegates. Tomorrow they will learn if their President, despite everything, remains in the role. One of Fifa’s major Wold Cup sponsors - Visa - has threatened to end its sponsorship, if football’s governing body doesn’t take ‘immediate steps’ to address alleged corruption. Many of Fifa’s other sponsors have also expressed concern about their association with the organisation in the wake of the latest allegations. Here’s Robert Peston. Balletic beauty from Lionel Messi at the last World Cup Finals, so the likes of Adidas, Coke and McDonald’s thought they were buying reflected glory, from being allowed to market their brands there. But today they’re suffering reflected shame from the scandal at Fifa. The real worry for the primary sponsors is partly being associated with something which is becoming a joke in itself and is therefore negative to their brands, and some of these brands are now having very adverse things put on the internet, their logos are being ridiculed and messed around with. You know, it’s not helpful in that respect. Now, this lousy publicity hasn’t exactly come cheap for Fifa’s top six sponsors, multinational giants like Coca-Cola and Visa, which paid a total of £116 million every year to Fifa between 2011 and 2014 for the precious opportunity to promote their brands at the World Cup. That means each of them was, on average, paying around £20 million a year. And even the so-called second-tier sponsors, which include household names like McDonald’s and Budweiser, were paying around £14 million every year for what they now see as the dubious privilege of being associated with football’s governing body. Infact, Visa, the payments business, today said, our disappointment and concern with Fifa in light of the day’s development is profound. It’s important that Fifa makes changes now. Should Fifa fail to do so, we’ve informed them that we will reassess our sponsorship. The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport... Which drew this response from the British Government. It is important that other sponsors reflect on their links to Fifa and consider following Visa’s lead. For sponsors like the maker of this advert, McDonald’s, the bell tolling. But although corporate sponsors hate the taint from Fifa, they fear the potential costs of cancelling their contracts with it, and they also love how the World Cup gives them a global captive audience. But what if one or two sponsors did show Fifa the red card and stop paying all that cash? Well, I’m told Fifa could easily replace them, so collective action by most sponsors may be required if they really want a genuinely beautiful game. Robert Peston, BBC News. Well we can return to Zurich now where Fifa’s conference took place today and speak to our Sports Editor Dan Roan. Do you think Sepp Blatter goes to bed confident he will be re-elected tomorrow? I think he will, yes. Given his reputation was at rock bottom today, many will have wondered whether or not he could hang on, withstand the unprecedented pressure. They should have known better. That was a remarkable, perhaps heap brazen performance by the President today, presenting himself as the reformed candidate, vowing to fix Fifa, refusing to take the blame, despite presiding over many crisis and scandals. Some will find it hard to imagine him standing there in 24 hours’ find it hard to imagine him standing there in 24 hours’ time, for success for a fifth term in office. But many people thinking he is good for them in the Fifa family. The problem for Blatter, even if he bins, he is the favourite but with the john Blatter, even if he bins, he is the favourite but with thejohn going investigations it may not be the end of his problems. David Cameron has said the status quo in Europe isn’t good enough. He was speaking alongside the French President Francois Hollande, who he met in Paris, as part of a whirlwind diplomatic tour to secure support for his proposed reforms to the EU. The Prime Minister said his priority is to make the EU more competitive and to address the concerns of British people about membership. Our deputy political editor, james Landale, reports from Paris. If it’s Thursday, it must be Paris. David Cameron’s diplomatic tour brought him today to the Elysee Palace to meet the man he has to have on side if he is to reform the EU, a president who thus far has proved short on flexibility when it comes to helping Britain. Tonight, the Prime Minister told his host the EU had to become more competitive. And what matters is that the European Union and its 28 members are flexible and imaginative enough to respond to these issues and to work together to find answers that will make the European Union more successful. But the French government says Mr Cameron’s referendum could be dangerous and will not support anything that it believes could threaten the EU. TRANSLATION: We believe it’s in the interests of Europe and the UK to stay together, but we must also respect the people. David Cameron will make a number of proposals, we will discuss them to see how we can move forward. ARCHIVE: The Royal Family, Cabinet ministers and other notables waited to bid a most hearty welcome to the head of the French state, Charles de Gaulle... Foryears, France, in the form of that President, resisted Britain even being a member of the EU. Today in Paris that suspicion lives on towards British plans to curb migrants’ benefits, opt out of ever closer union, and protect the single market from the eurozone. Reforms that Britain says will need a change to Europe’s treaties, something that those who watch politics here says is unacceptable to the French government if it forces them to have a referendum too. This year is the tenth anniversary of the referendum in 2005 about the European constitution that we rejected, and this is still a big trauma among French politicians. We don’t want to go that road ever again. Earlier, the Prime Minister was in the Netherlands for lunch with his Dutch counterpart, a man he called a like-minded ally, who shared some of his reform agenda, such as an EU which... Focusing on the essentials, not bothering itself with every little detail, but focusing on the essentials where working together can really add something to the British public, to the Dutch public. Back in London, a reminder of what Mr Cameron’s diplomacy hopes to achieve. European Union Referendum Bill... Which today began its passage through the Commons, establishing that voters will be asked, ""Should Britain remain a member of the EU?"" a question critics said would give those wanting to stay in the advantage of voting yes. And while Mr Cameron was wooing the French president, his Foreign Secretary was warning that if he and other leaders didn’t agree to substantive reforms, then Britain could still vote no. Downing Street hopes that the publication of this bill will concentrate minds here and elsewhere, that a referendum is now a reality and that if a substantial deal is not agreed, then they shouldn’t assume that Britain will vote yes and David Cameron will campaign for yes. Tonight, the Prime Minister left to continue his diplomatic tour. Next up, Warsaw and then Berlin. james Landale, BBC News, Paris. Our Europe editor Katya Adler is is Paris. The Prime Minister will visit four countries in two days - what’s the thinking behind this whistle stop tour? But this is a carefully calibrated itinary, really? It is. Let’s look at the European leaders, what they want from Britain as it seeks to change the EU is the sense that this is a process, not a diktat. Real negotiations will not start until the Prime Minister presents his wish-list, expected next month at the next EU summit. In the meantime, the tone is as important as content. So here in Paris we saw him carefully list a range of issues where Britain and France are standing side by side. In the Netherlands, there was reference to the country being an old friend and like-minded ally. David Cameron needs new leaders on side to pass meaningful reform. So yes, the four-country tour was carefully thought out, the Netherlands, Germany are seen as open to the UK, open to reforming the single market, having it stronger. France is tricky but alongside Germany it is a traditional EU heavyweight, and Poland is a rising star. So he will find an appetite for reform around Europe but the trickiest trick is to persuade the leaders that his way is the right way. An assault rifle linked to seven unsolved murders in Northern Ireland has been discovered on display at the Imperial War Museum in London. It’s believed the gun had disappeared from a police evidence room. The revelation was made on tonight’s BBC Panorama which investigated concerns that security force agents were involved in murders during the Troubles and were protected from prosecution. Here’s our Ireland correspondent, Chris Buckler. The state still holds secrets from a time of terror, a period when paramilitaries left life in Northern Ireland anything but normal. And among those behind the balaclavas were agents and informants for MI5, the army and the police. There are claims that the security forces colluded in a number of killings during the Troubles, including the notorious murders of five people in a bookmaker’s shop on Belfast’s Ormeau Road. Loyalist gunmen walked in and immediately opened fire. I kept looking, ""Is my daddy all right?"" He just turned around and said, ""Buddy, he’s gone, they’re all gone."" He said, ""Your daddy’s dead."" HE WAILS The police did recover a rifle that was used in the attack here, and it was also linked to two other unsolved killings. However, when the cases were reopened some years ago, the weapon couldn’t be found. It had disappeared from evidence, and eventually the families of the victims were told that it had been officially disposed of. That wasn’t true, and it has now been discovered miles away from Belfast in London, inside the Imperial War Museum, where the gun was on display. It has now been removed, a simple notice left in the place of a murder weapon. It’s not the only instance of evidence disappearing, and the BBC’s Panorama has heard concerns that agents were protected from prosecution. There was impunity, really, for these people to go on committing their crimes. Committing murder, impunity to kill? Including murder, yeah, yeah. Many of them were killers, and some of them were serial killers. Lord Stevens, who led investigations into collusion, has told Panorama that he believes there were thousands of informants working inside loyalist and republican gangs during the Troubles. The programme tried to ask the former head of the army in Northern Ireland about the allegations. I’m taking advice from my very experienced solicitor. But General Sirjohn Waters didn’t want to discuss the issue of agents. But this happened under your watch, General. Lots of things happened under my watch. The use of informants was intended to save lives, but there remains a serious question - was it at the cost ofjustice? Chris Buckler, BBC News, Belfast. The Methodist Church has apologised after an investigation it commissioned found nearly 2,000 claims of sexual, physical or emotional abuse. Allegations date back as far as the 1950s, as our special correspondent Lucy Manning reports. The Methodist Church - a place of prayer, but it’s also been one of abuse, nearly 2000 abusers or suspected ones in the Church. Frank - not his real name - was sexually abused at a Methodist school. His abusers are not longer alive. His words have been re-voiced to protect his identity. Ijust hated every minute of it. If I remember rightly, it always happened on a Thursday night. The teacher involved would come into my dormitory in his dressing gown and shout my name, and I would be taken to his room, where I was probably there for 15, 20, 25 minutes per time. For the incoming leader of the Methodist Church, there is shame they have not cared for the most vulnerable. The Church says sorry to the people who have been the survivors of abuse. The Church bitterly regrets that it has not always acted in a way to ensure that that abuse was identified and was dealt with appropriately. The review looked at the Church from the 1950s until last year and found there are still some concerns about more than 600 people, including 100 ministers. New information has led to six current police investigations. People didn’t always listen to survivors, victims of abuse, and if they listened, they didn’t always take the right action. Sometimes it was too difficult for them to hear what was being said. For Frank and other survivors, the Methodists’ review and apology is welcome. I have to respect them for being honest. I think, for 46 years, I thought nobody would believe me, but now they have come out and admitted it did take place. They can’t turn the clock back, but I admire them greatly for putting their hands up. The Methodist Church contacted current and former ministers, questionnaires were sent out, members were also asked for information. Now the question is being asked why other religions can’t be as open about the scale of abuse in their congregations. For Ann Lawrence, a survivor of abuse in the Catholic Church and now a member of the Methodist Church, there must be more transparency. We’ve seen in the Church of England, the Catholic Church a great reluctance to be open about the findings of their past case reviews. They haven’t shared with the public or with their own churches and church members the failings that happened and took place within their institutions. We’ve also not seen anything coming from Muslim communities, jewish communities, Sikh communities, Hindu communities. Survivors still feel other faiths have much to do. Lucy Manning, BBC News. A senior US General has told the BBC it’s imperative that Britain finds the money to spend on its armed forces, and is worried about the impact of recent defence cuts. His comments come as the US carried out sea trials for a new state-of-the-art jump jet which Britain is set to buy from the US. But the F-35 is already way over budget. Our defence correspondent jonathan Beale was given exclusive access to its final sea trials. We flew from the Pentagon to see its most expensive and ambitious weapons programme ever. Our destination - an aircraft carrier, where they had been carrying out the final tests before it goes into service. And this is it, the F-35. The price tag for developing these warplanes is already £250 billion - twice what it cost to put man on the moon. Britain too is buying this hi-techjumpjet but against the backdrop of recent defence cuts. This is a positive step forward for the F-35, a jet that has been plagued by problems. But it won’t be until the end of the decade, that we’ll see them landing on a British aircraft carrier and we still don’t know how many the UK can afford. Each one currently costs more than £65 million. Britain originally said it would buy 138 of them, that now has come down to 48. So far, it has boughtjust eight. For America, the F-35 is a key test for their closest military ally. And at the top of the US military, they want stronger British commitments. A lot of concern about defence spending in the UK at the moment, not hitting the right target. Are you worried that they will not buy enough planes? I pray that the very wise people in the United Kingdom find the money and the resources to commit to defence. I think it is imperative that we have you out there with us, standing there for right and freedom. I think you ought to buy as many as you can. Last year, David Cameron told his Nato allies to spend 2% of their national wealth on defence. But UK spending will soon fall below that. The Government says it is currently meeting the 2% target and will increase the defence equipment budget, but it is not ruling out cuts elsewhere. In America’s eyes, it’s the future of this aircraft that will prove whether Britain is really serious about defence. jonathan Beale, BBC News. Rail workers are to stage two national strikes next month. The walkout is about pay and conditions, after a deal couldn’t be reached with track operator Network Rail. Members of the RMT union will begin a 24-hour strike onjune 4th and a 48-hour stoppage onjune 9th. An international summit to discuss the migrant crisis in South East Asia begins in Thailand tomorrow. 25,000 people are estimated to have set sail from the Bay of Bengal in the first three months of this year alone. They’re hoping to reach Malaysia, and about half of them come from Bangladesh. justin Rowlatt has travelled to Teknaf on the country’s southern coast from where migrants make the perilousjourney in search of a better life. This is where many of the migrants’ treacherousjourneys begin, on the coast of southern Bangladesh. Driven by desperation, drawn by the hope of a better life, they set out into the surf of the Bay of Bengal. You really get a sense ofjust how dangerous these journeys can be. Coming out on these small boats, the migrants are packed in here and taken out to the deep ocean. Whoa. .. Whoa! That’s where they meet the big boats, the trawlers that are going to take them on the 1500 km, 1,000 mile journey all the way down to the coast of Thailand. These women’s husbands left for Malaysia together a year ago. Neither woman has seen their husband since. TRANSLATION: My husband used to say, ""I pray that I make it to Malaysia, I will earn and send home money so you can eat proper food and educate the children."" TRANSLATION: Many people from this area have gone, those who barely earned anything at all here in Bangladesh are now sending home thousands every month. That’s why I sent him. Like all the migrants’ relatives we spoke to, they knew their husbands would be held in Thailand. One of the men who organised this trade in people explained the deal. He confirmed migrants pay a small upfront fee, knowing they’ll only be released when the big money, £1,500, is paid. TRANSLATION: Before they leave here, we tell them, ""If you don’t pay, you will be put in prison. ""You won’t get any rice, and you’ll die of hunger. ""If you pay, you’ll be able to leave for Malaysia with honour."" It is a measure of how desperate the people here are that so many still want to go. And so many people go missing. We visited an unofficial settlement of Rohingya Muslim refugees who fled persecution in neighbouring Myanmar. Within minutes, people began to bring out pictures of missing relatives. Even when someone does make it to Malaysia, the torment isn’t necessarily over. Tahira Begum is calling her 14-year-old son. He travelled to Malaysia. He is earning some money, but his parents are saddled with huge debts, and his mother misses him terribly. justin Rowlatt, BBC News, southern Bangladesh. The UK’s most prestigious art award, the Turner Prize, is to be staged in Hull during its year as City of Culture in 2017. Work is already under way to regenerate parts of the city. Arts editor Will Gompertz has been hearing more about the preparations. And I ring my bell! And I very loudly, proudly yell, you can all go to Hull! Kingston-upon-Hull! The Turner Prize is coming in 2017, when Hull becomes UK City of Culture. OK, it does look a little tired in places today, but it’s having a £100 million makeover and will be transformed, the council says, into a vibrant, creative cultural centre. I know a lot of people who’ve moved out of city... Local theatre director Madeleine O’Reilly took me on a tour of a city preparing for its moment in the spotlight. This is Humber Street, which is going to be one of the main kind of arts, cultural areas in Hull for 2017. It seems pretty derelict at the moment. It is at the moment, but what they’re going to do, or what I’ve been told they’re going to do, is keep, like, these original facades, bring up the cobbles that were originally here, so pay and honour the past of it. Good place for a studio for you? Yeah, I think so, I’d like to, hint, hint! Currently we’ve got a building site, it’s going to be a digital hub, and then behind it, it’s going to be an amphitheatre. At the moment it’s a dry dock. An amphitheatre? Yeah. We’re just on the edges of Old Town, which is also going to get a makeover. Yes, it is, this is Holy Trinity church, they’re going to stretch this out into a piazza area. It does need some TLC. ",,

Facing calls to quit, Fifa’s current head Sepp Blatter is seeking a fifth term. He’s being challenged by Prince Ali bin al-Hussein ofjordan. We’ll be live at the Fifa congress in Zurich. Also this lunchtime: Last stop Berlin - David Cameron meets the German Chancellor on his diplomatic tour of Europe, to discuss the changes he wants in the EU. The European Union is better off with the United Kingdom as a member and I believe Britain’s national interests can best be served by staying in the European Union on the basis of reforms. A legal challenge to the general election victory of Scotland’s only Liberal Democrat MP is launched this afternoon. An emergency summit is held in Thailand to deal with the migrant crisis in South East Asia. Producers and sellers of legal highs could face seven years in prison, under new proposed legislation. Later on BBC London: Another cyclist has died after a collision with a lorry in south London - the sixth such death this year. Plus, it’s a rainy day ahead but what does the weekend hold? Your local and national forecast is coming up. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. Voting begins in a few hours to decide who should preside over football’s world governing body, as it finds itself embroiled in a major corruption scandal. The incumbent Fifa president, Sepp Blatter, has appealed for unity as he addressed delegates on the second day of congress in Switzerland - but has again resisted calls to step aside. The vote comes two days after seven high-ranking officials were arrested in Zurich, in an FBI fraud inquiry that indicted IA people. Christian Fraser is there. It is to the immense frustration of many people in football that is often the senior executives within Fifa, and none more so than President Sepp Blatter himself, seem almost impervious to the allegations of corruption and criticism, intense criticism, that surrounds them. Again, today, we heard similar noises from Sepp Blatter at the opening of the second day of the Fifa Congress, telling delegates he couldn’t possibly be held responsible for the misdemeanours of a few people that surround him. Football, he said, is an enormous enterprise. That doesn’t hold much salt with Uefa and the European authorities who have called on him to go and today it is being stressed openly the nuclear option that is being plastered all over the German newspaper Bild, a boycott of the World Cup in 2018 if he’s re-elections Li re-elected, imagine the ramifications. He has put himself forward for a fifth term as President and our correspondent Richard Conway has been looking at the vote that will unfold later today. Sepp Blatter is determined to project an image that it is business as usual for Fifa. But following dawn raids earlier this week and the rest But following dawn raids earlier this week and the arrest of football officials over allegations of widescale bribery and corruption the organisation he leads is mired in a deep crisis. Inside, any hope he had of starting the day off quietly was soon shattered by a protester. Expel this man from Fifa! In a resolute address Sepp Blatter insisted the responsibility must be shared and unity restored. TRANSLATION: We have talked about arriving at a turning point and we use that expression again, we are at a turning point. And thus it is that we need to pull together and move forward. What we know about the two men going head-to-head in today’s vote? Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein ofjordan is the only challenger to Sepp Blatter. He said a change of leadership is necessary to restore confidence in Fifa. He’s the third son of the king ofjordan. He was educated in America and the UK and then went on to the military Academy at Sandhurst and now holds the rank of Brigadier in the jordanian army. He’s married to Rym Brahimi, a former CNN journalist and daughter of the former UN envoy for Syria. At 79 Sepp Blatter has led the organisation for 17 years through numerous corruption and bribery scandals. He was born into a modest family in the alpine village of Visp. He also had military training, rising to the rank of colonel in the Swiss Army. He’s been married three times and has one daughter and a grand-daughter. He insists his mission at Fifa is not over and cites women’s football as a priority. Supporters of Prince Ali are remaining optimistic ahead of the vote. Who are you going to vote for? The Welsh have been very clear, we are voting for Prince Ali. Why? We hope that other nations will be get behind Wales and we will see change. So, how will the election work? The 209 member football associations will vote later in a secret ballot. In the first round a candidate must get 140 votes, two thirds, to win outright. If that is not achieved there will be a second round requiring a simple majority. Whoever gets the most votes wins. No matter what the outcome of today’s events are, those who want reform and his departure are determined to carry on, believing a tipping point has been reached. Richard Conway, BBC News, Zurich. just a justa reminder investigations ongoing into Fifa corruption, there is the investigation of the Department of justice in the knighted States, parallel to an investigation in Switzerland into the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. That investigation may be widening because we’ve had information in the past half an hour from the Serious Fraud Office in the UK saying it is actively assessing material in its possession relating to the claims and stands ready to assist ongoing international investigations. The US is taking the lead, but it seems other law enforcement agencies are now becoming actively involved. Our correspondent Philip Norton has been looking at where the investigations might go from here. When police swooped on both sides of the Atlantic early on Wednesday morning it set the ball rolling on the biggest scandal ever to hit world football. But the FBI is behind the arrests is telling, serious international crimes involved with as amounts of money, bribes, fraud and money-laundering. Today, the Serious Fraud Office said it too is looking at material relating to Fifa corruption allegations. There are two separate investigations underway, while the American inquiry focuses on the financial side, Swiss prosecutors are looking into the bidding process for the World Cup tournaments in 2018 in Russia and 2022in tournaments in 2018 in Russia and 2022 in Qatar. There is potentially two big lateral actions that could happen with countries that were unsuccessful with their bids who will talk about a corrupt tender process and that it was unfair on them. And the second thing will be sports broadcasters who haven’t got the broadcast rights to the particular tournaments that are the subject of this corruption. But authorities say this is just the start. The FBI alleges widespread corruption at Concacaf, football’s governing body in North and Central America. They have arrested seven officials at the Hotel in Switzerland. It claims corruption totalling $150 million over 21 years through marketing contracts for tournaments and the bidding process for South Africa’s 2010 World Cup. They also allege corruption over Sepp Blatter’s election as Fifa’s 's. It has put the world’s focus on Mr blatter, with pressure from Prime Minister ‘s to multinational companies, and even the United Nations. The man with friends in high places may hang onto his title thanks support Africa and the Americas. But Swiss authorities say he could still yet to be questioned himself as the investigation continues. Could it be one last dance for a man who loves the spotlight? Philip Norton, BBC News. No explanation from Fifa as to why the President of the Brazilian Association has flown home. Apparently, according to the newspapers, he was spooked by the arrests of his predecessor in the dawn raids on Wednesday. We will see the reaction to that later in the day. just to remind there are 209 football associations that will be voting injust over three hours’ time. You can follow it on our website and on the BBC News Channel we will bring you the results and reaction at lipm UK time. Back to you in the studio. Thank you, Christian Fraser. Angela Merkel says she wants to work with David Cameron to be a constructive part on post EU reform. David Cameron has been holding crucial talks with the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, as he continues his whirlwind tour of Europe. Securing the backing of the leader of Europe’s largest economy, will be crucial to his chances of EU reform. jenny Hill is in Berlin. jenny. Yes, we have always found a solution in the past. The words of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, following talks with David Cameron here in Berlin this lunchtime. This is the final stop of his diplomatic tour of Europe. He has been to four different countries as he seeks support for his renegotiation of Britain’s relationship with the EU. He’s fresh from an election victory. She’s the most powerful woman in Europe. What will Angela Merkel do to keep Britain in the EU? TRANSLATION: Of course we have the desire to work very closely together. We would like to be a part of the process that is going on in Great Britain at the moment and we would like to be a constructive part of this process. The European Union has shown before that when one of its member states has a problem that needs sorting out it can effect civil enough to do so. And I have every confidence that it will do so again. The European Union is better off with the United Kingdom as a member and I believe that Britain’s national interest can best be served by staying in the European Union on the basis of a reformed settlement. The UK matters to Germany, it’s an important export market and an important economy and a business partner and ally in Europe. But one of Germany’s most senior businessmen told me, while David Cameron is threatening Britain’s exit Angela Merkel should refuse to negotiate. We are really astonished about this referendum. There are also other countries with their own problems and from our own perspective it is really a domestic political issue. Our recommendation is not to deal under such circumstances. Nevertheless, the European charm offensive continues. Paris yesterday, offensive continues. Paris yesterday, where David Cameron told the French the status quo is not good enough. Poland, this morning, where they don’t like his plans to cut benefits for EU migrants. Both countries want Britain in, but refuse to support treaty change. Where does that leave Britain? Here is Germany’s finance minister. It’s a decision of the UK if they want to ask for a referendum. a decision of the UK if they want to ask fora referendum. I’m ask for a referendum. I’m sure the majority will vote for staying in Europe. What concessions is Europe prepared to offer Britain? This visit is unlikely to have changed the German position. There is a willingness here to compromise but a warning too what David Cameron wants he may not get. So, what happens now? Angela Merkel just said, we are seeing details now, some of them for the very first time. They are going to start working through those details, teams of advisers are working on this behind-the-scenes looking to see if some kind of compromise can be reached. The sense here is very much that this isjust reached. The sense here is very much that this is just the beginning. jane. jenny, thank you. jenny Hill. Northern Ireland’s First Minister Peter Robinson has been discharged from hospital, where he had been recovering from a suspected heart attack. The Democratic Unionist Party has said it hopes he will be back at work soon. Mr Robinson says he’s happy to be back at home, and thanked hospital staff for their care. Campaigners hoping to overturn the election of the Orkney and Shetland MP, Alistair Carmichael, are on their way to the Court of Session in Edinburgh to lodge legal papers. It follows the admission last week by the former Scottish Secretary, that he was behind the leak of a controversial memo about Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. Our Scotland political correspondent Tim Reid is in Westminster. How does this work? What is the chance of success for the campaigners? Legal opinion on this is a bit mixed. Those lawyers I have spoken to suggest it is going to be difficult for those seeking to overturn Alistair Carmichael’s election, there’s usually these kind of things would be challenged on bribery or corruption. There is no question of that in this case, or if a candidate has made a misleading orfalse claim against another candidate. And in this case the memo that Alistair Carmichael leaked to the papers was about Nicola Sturgeon’s views, that she wanted David Cameron to remain Prime Minister. He now says that’s incorrect and has apologised for leaking it but she wasn’t a candidate in the election, she played a big role in the campaign but is First Minister of Scotland and a member of the Scottish Parliament. We have not yet seen the petition, it’s due to be launched at the Court of Session in Scotland are in about an hour’s time. The Lib Dems say they will not comment until they have seen it. Alistair Carmichael has of course apologised and said he has forfeited his ministerial pay off and is going to remain as an MP. He’s been carrying out some constituency work today in Orkney. But of course this also adds to the mounting pressure on him. There is a Parliamentary Commissionerfor There is a Parliamentary Commissioner for standards deciding whether she’s going to launch an investigation into the complaint made to her. Police Scotland are making inquiries about a complaint made to them. He says he will remain an MP and his colleagues have rallied around him this week, conscious, I think, rallied around him this week, conscious, Ithink, that conscious, I think, that he’s the only remaining Lib Dem MP in Scotland. Ten, thank you, Tim Reid. Our top story this lunchtime: Fifa prepares to vote for its next president, despite the worst corruption scandal in the organisation’s history. A healthy option or a very sweet treat? The sugar warning about processed fruit snacks. Coming up in sport at 1:30pm: England hooker Dylan Hartley will miss this year’s World Cup as a result of his latest ban. Stuart Lancaster will exclude him from his training squad after his sixth career suspension. Officials from 17 countries are holding emergency talks in Bangkok to try to tackle Asia’s growing migrant crisis. Thousands of people have fled Bangladesh and Myanmar by boat, seeking refuge in Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia. It’s thought that many are still at sea. In a moment, we’ll bring you the latest developments from that summit. First, our correspondent has visited a shelter in the Indonesian province of Aceh and sent this report. When these people first arrived on the coast of this province of Aceh, they were severely malnourished and weak, and they had nothing except the clothes on their skin. Now look at them. This is not luxury accommodation by any means, but at least they have brand-new mattresses to sleep on, a change of clothes, toys for the children and plenty of food and water. A few of the people here are teenagers and children who left their homes and got on the boat without their parents. One of them is Mohammed, a 17-year-old. Why did you leave your home? ~ I want to become an education person. Everyone in this warehouse is Rohingya, the Muslim minority that is being persecuted in Myanmar and Bangladesh. About 100 metres over there is another warehouse that shelters the men from Bangladesh. They have been found to be economic migrants who are trying to escape poverty and look for jobs in Malaysia. But the government of Indonesia is already in the process of sending them back. But one thing that everyone here has in common is that they are trying to get out of a desperate situation back home, and they have ended up in countries that are unable and uneager to cope with an influx of migrants like them. Our South East Asia correspondent jonathan Head is in Bangkok, where the summit is taking place. Has there been any sort of agreement? There has. It has been a whole day of meetings, not easy getting agreement on some things among 17 countries. A bit of finger-pointing at Myanmar, Burma, at the cause of this because of their treatment of the Muslims, something they rejected. When you think of the situation the migrants were in two weeks ago when these countries were pushing them back, months and months where this ghastly human trade has been almost secret, today we have countries all agreeing as a matter of urgency to raise their search and rescue efforts to find the boats they think are stranded out there still. And to help the thousands who have come to shore, letting in the international agencies. That is a good result. In terms of the longer-term problem, dealing with the flows of people in Europe from impoverished Bangladesh and Myanmar in particular, some guidelines have been laid down although it will not be solved quickly. In terms of the immediate humanitarian crisis, they are putting aside their worries for the moment about mass migration and saying, we have to help these people. Military aircraft from the US now able to leave Thailand and scanned the sea for any boats stranded. From a humanitarian point of view, this has been a success. The longer-term problem of migration remains in many ways as intractable as in the rest of the world. Thank you, jonathan. Producers and sellers of so-called legal highs could face up to seven years in prison under new laws being proposed by the government. It wants a blanket ban on all mind-altering substances throughout the UK, unless they’re specifically approved. But critics of drug legislation say it simply puts users back in the hands of drug dealers, and so leaves them at greater risk of harm. At this Home Office laboratory near St Albans, they have spent the last few years desperately trying to keep UP few years desperately trying to keep up with the manufacturers of what have become known as legal highs. But every time the government banned a new drug, what is known as a psychoactive substance, another one pvpped up psychoactive substance, another one popped up in its place. The substances are appearing almost before the legislation comes into effect. The minute the producers know that something will be banned, they have already started to make something new. Most of the psychoactive substances sold in Britain are made in China, leaving scientists here trying to catch up and identify them as they come on the market. And they can be very dangerous. This was 1lI-year-old Owen just hours after he took a legal high. Fortunately he survived. His mother described today the family’s terrifying experience. He was in the ambulance, wired up to machines. He had a grip inside him. He was fitting. He was shaking. -- a had a grip inside him. He was fitting. He was shaking.-- a drip inside him. I asked why he was shaking, they said he was fitting. I don’t want any other family to go through what we went through. Faced with stories like these, and hundreds of deaths linked to legal highs, the government has today taken a dramatic new approach, a bill which bans the sale of all psychoactive, mind altering substances. The only exceptions are tobacco, alcohol, caffeine, food and medicines. The Republic of Ireland in 2010, they did a blanket ban. It has absolutely decimated, thank goodness, these sorts of products that young people were taking. The sale and production of them. Campaigners have warned that this willjust drive people who are determined to use the chemicals back into the hands of organised criminals. What we are going to see is a situation where the drug dealers will now profit from the substances. Today’s bill also covers nitrous oxide, laughing gas, which when inhaled from balloons has become popular at festivals and with clubbers. Soon it will only be legal to sell the gas for medical or industrial use. Daniel is here now. It is absolutely clear that the government wants to be very strong about this. It thinks the way to deal with these substances is prohibition. In recent years, there has been a proliferation of modification to chemicals to stay on the right side of the law. The proliferation of the use of laughing gas by clubbers. Young people were somehow perhaps getting the impression that stuff that was not banned might somehow be safer. So the ministers’ concern has been that we need to make sure that people understand not only should they not be selling this stuff, because it could be causing harm, that users need to understand that anything thatis need to understand that anything that is changing how your brain works could potentially be dangerous. That is why they have gone down this very broad brush, blanket ban approach, so why do they have said, actually, food and coffee are not included in the band. But still in the background, people think we should be taking a different approach. -- think we should be taking a different approach. -- the ban. Although they do not have widespread support among politicians, some campaigners feel that at some point they will have to have a radical approach and go down the licensing route instead. A crime reporter at the Sun newspaper who paid a police officer a total of more than £22,000 for information has been given an 18-month suspended prison sentence. Anthony France was convicted of aiding and abetting a counter-terrorism police officer to commit misconduct in public office. june Kelly is at the Old Bailey. The judge said that while some of the stories Anthony France had paid for work in the public interest, others were not and were simply salacious. He said this was notjust a case of money being handed over in a grubby envelope in a dark corner of a pub. He said this was a fairlyjunior member of staff at the Sun who was following accept a procedure in giving money to an established contact. Thejudge giving money to an established contact. The judge described Anthony France as essentially a decent man of solid integrity and social responsibility. He suspended his 18 month sentence for two years. He also said he should do 200 hours of community service. News International, the owners of the Sun, have paid his legal bills. The judge said that they, the company, should pick up the prosecution costs of this case and it should be them rather than the tax-payer that pays the bill. Thank you. The BBC has uncovered a tax avoidance scheme that aims to exploit the government’s employment allowance, allowing firms to claim up to £2,000 off their National Insurance bill. The scheme could deprive the Treasury of tens of millions of pounds. Our personal Finance correspondent hasjoined me. Explain how this scheme works. This scheme being offered by a payroll management company, Anderson, depends on the tax break brought in by the Chancellor last year to encourage small businesses to employ more people. The tax break is worth £2000 per business, that is money off the national insurance that they have to pay. But what was suggested in one case was that a business could set UP case was that a business could set up 150 smaller companies within itself, each of which would claim the national insurance back, so the total would be £300,000, rather than just £2000. This wasn’t at all what the government intended. But listen to what the sales manager of Anderson Group said to defend this in a secret recording that Radio 1+'s Today programme made. It wasn’t intended to be used exactly like this. But they set the rules. We will build a product. The employment allowance scheme allows us to open UP allowance scheme allows us to open up a whole new world. They say what they are doing is compliant with UK tax law. So why did the tax authorities not pick up on this? Particularly since it could cost the government millions of pounds in lost national insurance, they won’t tell me whether they knew about it already, although they are grateful to the BBC for highlighting it. They say it is ranked tax avoidance. just be clear, if a firm comes up with an avoidance scheme, whether or not they think it is within the rules, they have register it within the tax authorities otherwise they could be fined up to £1 million. If tax has been improperly avoided, it eventually will have to be paid back. Thank you, Simon. If you’re someone who worries about how much sugar your child eats, you may well buy a fruit snack rather than, say, a packet of Haribo sweets. But what you might not know is that you could actually be feeding your child more sugar. Our health correspondent can explain. Making sure our children have a good nutritious diet is a big concern for parents. For some, fruit snacks are convenient answer. What do parents know exact a how much sugar these snacks contain? I give them fruit which has a certain amount of natural sugar, which has a certain amount of naturalsugar, but natural sugar, but I would not give them fruit sweets or a lot of fruit juice. I buy them because they have food in them sol juice. I buy them because they have food in them so I think it is a good idea. Are you aware of how much sugar they contain? Perhaps we should look a bit more closely. Fruitjuice concentrate... Experts Fruit juice concentrate. .. Experts warned Fruitjuice concentrate... Experts warned the sugar in these snacks is different to that which occurs naturally in fresh fruit. If you are eating fruit in its natural state, you get more nutrients and fibre, from the skin, it is not broken down. As soon as it starts to be processed, you are using an awful lot of the nutrients. -- processed, you are using an awful lot of the nutrients. -- you are losing. Sometimes you consume more quantities it in large concentration. Researchers looked at 94 fruit snack products on sale in the UK. 85% contained more sugar than sweets, some had more than four teaspoons per portion. 99% of the snacks would receive a red colour coded warning honour for high sugar content. So researchers say that a child that eight two of these fruit snacks would have to eat an entire packet of strawberries to consume the same amount of sugar. But manufacturers say information on nutrition and sugar is clearly marked and it is up to parents to decide what they feed their kids. It is disingenuous for Action On Sugar to say that the sugars in these types of product are hidden. Because the sugar content is clearly displayed on the pack. In the nutrition table. This empowers consumers to make free choices for them and their children. But health campaigners say that parents already find it hard enough to work out what is healthy for their kids, and the packaging and the content of these fruit snacks does not help. You’re watching the BBC News at One. Our top story today - Fifa prepares to vote for its next president amid the worst corruption scandal in the organisation’s111-year history. In a moment, we’ll have the weather. Plus the news where you are. But first with the sport here’s Hugh Woozencroft. England Head Coach Stuart Lancaster has dropped Northampton Captain Dylan Hartley from his World Cup squad after a series of disciplinary problems. It’s more bad news for Hartley, who’s replaced in the squad by the man he head butted, Saracen’sjamie George. Our Rugby Union reporter Chrisjones joins me. What has cost him his place? Two reasons, first the practical rugby reasons are that when Dylan Hartley’s ban finishes in September after the England against Fiji opener he won’t have played rugby forfour opener he won’t have played rugby for four months and England opener he won’t have played rugby forfour months and England can’t afford to go into the World Cup with only two available pokers. The other big issue is Dylan Hartley’s lingering and repetitive disciplinary lapses. He’s been in the last chance saloon for some months and this is the final straw. His England career isn’t over. Stuart Lancasterjust His England career isn’t over. Stuart Lancaster just told Stuart Lancasterjust told me there is a chance he could be recalled after the World Cup and even during the World Cup if there is a spate of injuries. Lancaster has been clear there are four other hookers in front of him in the pecking order and they will be the ones that time and energy will be invested into, so Dylan Hartley misses the World Cup and he missed the Lions tour two years ago also for disciplinary reasons. Staying with Rugby Union - it’s a big weekend of deciders as Glasgow Warriors face Munster in the Pro 12 Final, whilst the Premiership final sees Saracens take on Bath. Bath haven’t won the league title in the Premiership era, with their last win in 1996 whilst Saracens look to cement more recent success with a first win since 20-11. Both teams go into this year’s final buoyant. Bath are a really good team and have a great all-round game. We are going to have to be really good to beat them on the day. But we know if we show the best of ourselves, which we’ve shown six or seven times this season, we will be hard to beat. We have to tackle correctly and carry the ball like we have all year. If you stay in the moment and stay in you will play as well as well as you can. If you start thinking about there is 80,000 watching and there is a big prize and we haven’t won it since 1996, you know, you will freeze, try and grab it, try and want it there and then. The morning session of the second test between England and New Zealand has been a washout. Rain at Headingley stopped any chance of play this morning. But the outlook looks better for the afternoon, with play due to start shortly. Play hasjust Play has just begun. to bowl. Liverpool have made a £10 million bid for Southampton defender Nathaniel Clyne. The club rejected it. The England international is in the last year of his contract at St Mary’s. Liverpool are expected to return with an improved offer for Clyne, who has previously attracted interest from Manchester United. The women’s World Cup begins next weekend and England are in Toronto preparing. Tonight they have their final friendly, against tournament hosts Canada, in a match you can watch on the Red Button and BBC Sport Website. It sees a return for England captain Steph Horton, who’s recovered from a knee injury to take her place in the squad. They have sold over 20,000 tickets, there is only 500 left in that stadium and to get used to the World Cup atmosphere it will be vital to perform well under those conditions. As a squad we just have to concentrate on what we can deliver and the game plan we’ve been given to go and play against Canada. We know that when we face a tough opposition it shows the best in us. It’s day two of golf’s Irish Open, and Rory Mcllroy will be hoping to improve on yesterday’s torrid round of nine over par. A loose second shot a the par-5 opening hole hasn’t helped his cause. He did recover to make par but it’s fair to say the odds are now firmly on him missing the cut for the third-straight year in County Down - still 9 over par. 13 off the lead. That’s all sport for now. Back to you. Thousands of children have been spared hospital treatment for chest infections, since the ban on smoking in public places was introduced in England eight years ago. Researchers say the drop in admissions has been most noticeable among poorer families. Here’s our health correspondent, jane Dreaper. The ban on smoking in public places indoors has been a big change. Now there is further evidence of the health benefits which stem from children having less exposure to second-hand smoke. This latest study looked at children who had been admitted to hospital in England over the past decade with chest, nose, throat or sinus infections. It is thought 11,000 fewer children ended up in hospital each year after smoke-free legislation was introduced in 2007. The research found an immediate drop of almost 14% in chest infection cases. The smoking ban has been associated with spectacular public health benefits. We have seen reductions in hospital admissions for heart attacks, stroke and also asthma admissions both in children and adults. This adds important information to say that these benefits really extend to children in an important way. It is thought this reduction in children’s cases has saved NHS hospitals £70 million per year. Campaigners hope that more parents will stop smoking at home. Time for a look at the weather- here’s Ben Rich. How is it looking for the weekend? It is a weekend of ups and downs because we have a queue of weather systems waiting to head in our direction right across the Atlantic, and even back across North America where you can see clumps of cloud, each one heading towards us in the next few days. Each one bringing a spell of wind and rain. This weather system we have at the moment has brought quite a lot of rain across Wales and the southern half of England in particular. You can see the bright colours on the radar and also the wind gusts, 50-60 mph gusts across coastal spots and even 30-40 mph gusts inland, very wet and windy weather, now exiting stage right clearing from the south-east. Behind that things brighten up nicely, good spells of sunshine. There are heavy showers, possibly thundery ones for Northern England and Northern Ireland and Scotland. But for all of us a breezy afternoon and a fairly call on as well, 11th-16 degrees. During this evening and tonight most of the showers will fade away and the wind will tend to become lighter in most places. It’s quite late in the season, the end of May, but it is still potentially going to be quite a chilly night with those like twins, clear skies. Towns and cities in single figures but in the countryside sunspots in the north and West particularly close to freezing. So there could be a touch of grass frost in some places tomorrow morning. But on balance tomorrow is the better day of the weekend, mainly dry and bright, and there will be quite a lot of sunshine in central and eastern areas. Some showers continue across the far north-west of Scotland and then things change in the West with more cloud throwing its self in, patchy rain into Northern Ireland, the far west of Wales and south-west of England. Ahead of that a decent afternoon with highs of 18 degrees. For the Scottish cup final it should stay fine and for the FA Cup final staying fine as well but increasingly cloudy through the evening at Wembley, as our weather system, the next one in the queue, begins to push its way in from the West. It’s quite an active area of low pressure with weather fronts tightly squeezed and isobars, meaning quite a windy and wet spell of weather into Saturday night taking us into Sunday morning. So, a wet and windy start to Sunday. But remember it’s a weekend of ups and downs, turning brighter later as the rain clears, particularly across Northern Ireland, England and Wales, staying quite wet across the far north of Scotland and quite windy across the far north-west, and those temperatures on the cool side again, 17 degrees at best. There is another weather system waiting in the queue and that will be with us for the start of next week. Thank you, Ben. Nowa reminder of our top story this lunchtime: The head of world football, Sepp Blatter, has urged Fifa delegates to re-elect him today - despite the worst corruption scandal in the organisation’s history. That’s all from us, now on BBC One it’s time for the news where you are - have a good afternoon. Welcome to BBC London news - I’m Victoria Hollins. A 32-year-old woman has become the latest cyclist to die on London’s roads. She was in collision with a lorry in Denmark Hill yesterday and died overnight. Alex Bushill has more. It was here just before 8am yesterday morning that this cyclist was involved in what proved to be a fatal accident. Let me show you exactly where it happened. This is Denmark Hill and it was on thisjunction here with Orpheus Street that she was involved in a collision with a heavy goods vehicle. Now, it’s believed that she was 32 years of age. I’ve spoken to some of the shop owners here who saw what happened and the aftermath, and they said to me about how eyewitnesses rushed to give first aid. It is also here, just about 100 metres away, from King’s College Hospital further up Denmark Hill. And she was taken there after the accident. It wasn’t proved to be enough even being that close because she was pronounced dead. She died from her injuries yesterday evening. This is the sixth fatality for cyclists on London’s roads this year alone. A man from Reading and a woman from Wokingham have been arrested on suspicion of preparing for acts of terrorism in the UK. Police say the pair, believed to be friends, were detained last night. Their homes, in the Palmer’s Park area and in Earley, were searched - but the police say the pair did not pose an imminent threat. Thousands of foreign drivers are failing to pay for the Dartford Crossing since an automated payment system was introduced. Toll booths were scrapped at the end of last year. Highways England - which runs the crossing - says it may have to write off tens of thousands of pounds of fines. Traders at Shepherd’s Bush Market are going to the High Court over plans to knock it down and build a new market in its place. Developers want to make space for 200 homes. The businesses have been offered a spot in the new market - but they’re worried about what the future holds, asjean Mackenzie reports. This is £17.50 altogether, please.

In the last couple of minutes, Sepp Blatter has won the first round of voting but has not secured a two thirds majority and now faces a second round. Despite allegations of rampant corruption inthe organisation and high-profile arrest this week, 79-year-old Sepp Blatter who has led Fifa fought 17 years is still widely predicted to win. Today he said he was the man to fix Fifa. Dan Rowan is there for us. Two minutes ago, we had the news we are going to a second round of voting. In the nick of time. Sepp Blatter who came in as the red-hot favourite to extend his tenure at Fifa, he will go to a second round. He was very much the favourite. But then Fifa was plunged into chaos as a result of the mass corruption allegations. And the longer time went on, the more chance Prince Ali seem to have. It seemed to be he might get enough votes to taken to a second round and that is what has happened. Sepp Blatter inthe second round and that is what has happened. Sepp Blatter in the first round secured 133 votes, Prince Ali got 73. Sepp Blatter was seven short of taking it inthe got 73. Sepp Blatter was seven short of taking it in the first round, much closer than he pulled thought. Here is the story of the day. As they arrived this morning amid a mass corruption scandal, delegates were faced with a simple choice, a vote for change inthe shape of Prince Ali ofjordan or for the man who has been in charge for 17 years. Inside as the 209 Football Association is focused on the agenda, an early sign of the rancour. Security, please. ra ncour. Security, please. Protesters rancour. Security, please. Protesters forced their way in and briefly disrupted proceedings. Fifa is no stranger to controversy. Wednesday’s dramatic arrests of football officials amid bribery allegations, the biggest crisis in its history. Prince Ali hopes to take advantage. He has campaigned for change and he vowed to restore Fifa’s battered reputation. We have heard voices describing our Fifa as an avaricious body feeding off the game the world loves. We have heard questions raised about whether our formerly is morally bankrupt-- our family. If you give me the honour of your vote, family. If you give me the honour of yourvote, I your vote, I will take full responsibility and hold myself accountable to all of you and to the world. Sepp Blatter insisted responsibility must be shared and made clear his confidence inthe power base he has built up. Ido not need to introduce myself to you. You know who you are dealing with. And I also know that I can count on you. We need to recover our good name. We need to do this and we will start tomorrow morning with this goal in mind. I will tomorrow morning with this goal in mind. Iwill quite simply... I tomorrow morning with this goal in mind. I will quite simply... I would like to stay with you. I would like to continue with you. With that, it was time for Fifa to decide. England is in booth one. Each delegate cast their vote in is in booth one. Each delegate cast theirvote in turn their vote in turn in a process that took over an hour their vote in turn in a process that took overan hourand took over an hour and a half and it has now gone to a second round. just to confirm, Sepp Blatter unable to win inthe first round, unable to win out right. 133 votes to 73, seven short of the required number to win out right. It will be encouraging to his opponents. The lead is sufficient to expect him to win inthe second round. But Sepp Blatter’s opponents will see it as a bloody nose for the Fifa president. Evenif bloody nose for the Fifa president. Even if he wins a fifth successive term. This will not be the end of his troubles. Thank you. The ballot is secret but it is widely believed despite the allegations of corruption and wrongdoing in Fifa, Sepp Blatter is likely to secure backing from football associations in Africa, Asia and South America.

He has claimed women footballers should wear tighter shorts, racist incidents should be settled by a handshake and made light of gay fanss concerns about going to Qatar. They should refrain from any sexual activities. It begs the question, how has he stayed at the top? The answer lies away from football’s traditional strongholds. He brought the first-ever World Cup to Africa as well as funding and facilities. In return, they gave him loyalty. Looking at small countries in Africa, they have received a fairly good amount of money from Fifa for development. Sepp Blatter has been seen as a friend for Africa. Fifa has been looking after Africa. There is his commercial success in Fifa’s very own feature film. The accounts are disastrous. Sepp Blatter is good at finding money. It is Sepp Blatter all action hero. A man who craves the spotlight. This is his life. He does not have a family, he lives for this. If it was not fall these dreadful accusations, this.

One of the men arrested on Wednesday as the Trinidadianjack of the men arrested on Wednesday as the Trinidadian jack Warner. He’s been charged with racketeering, corruption, and money laundering. But he denies all the charges, saying they’re part of an American vendetta against developing nations. Rajini Vaidyanathan travelled to the Port of Spain to meet him. This report contains some flash photography. He is the man wanted by the FBI on some of the most serious corruption charges in football history. But to his supporters, jack Warner is a hero. Hours after being released from jail, the former Fifa executive turned politician was defined. In an exclusive interview, he told me he is innocent. I have never taken a bribe. I will say it more slowly. I have never taken a bribe. On Thursday evening, jack Warner made a bizarre exit from this prison. Leaving in an ambulance instead of walking out. Now on bail, he plans to fight extradition to the US and accuses the FBI of discrimination against developing nations. He questions why Sepp Blatter was not arrested. If Fifa is corrupt, if I am correct, that means he is corrupt. They should have charged Sepp Blatter? If what they say is true, why haven’t they? He is universally disliked. Yet they have not touched him. Why? jack Warner is a huge name in Trinidad. Many praise him for getting this tiny nation into the World Cup. But others question his rise to the top will stop officials have been a -- question his rise to the top will stop officials have been a -- rise to the top. Officials have been investigating him for years. 72-year-old jack Warner is facing charges that could send him to prison for the rest of his life. Today’s other news now. David Cameron, visiting Angela Merkel in Berlin today, received a boost to his plans for EU reform when the German Chancellor said she wasn’t ruling out changes to existing European treaties. But there was a less positive response in Poland about his idea to curb migrants’ rights to welfare. This report from our deputy political editor, james Landale, contains some flash photography. In Berlin today, they pulled out all of the stops. Guards of honour, yards of red-carpet and a warm hug and a kiss. He does not get this everywhere. But this was not just a display of German respect for a newly elected Prime Minister, it was also the continent’s most powerful politician extends inthe hand of friendship to a leader she wants in lockstep, notjust with her friendship to a leader she wants in lockstep, not just with her but also the rest of Europe. After a quick lunch, Chancellor Merkeljoins David lunch, Chancellor Merkel joins David Cameron lunch, Chancellor Merkeljoins David Cameron before the cameras and suggested she could do a deal with her guest over his plans to reform it you. TRANSLATION: We want to work closely together inthe process that the UK is going through towards a referendum and the changes it wants in the referendum and the changes it wants inthe EU. We would like to help in a constructive way. As I have said before, where there is a will, there is a way. What chance do you believe David Cameron has in achieving his reforms? Given the opposition you and so many other leaders have towards the treaty changes he is seeking. This has to be decided once you have agreed the content. Does it need treaty change or a change in secondary law? If you are convinced of an idea, you cannot say it is an absolute impossibility. To a Prime Minister who has been told no so often, this was perhaps very welcome. I was very heartened by what the Chancellor said. If content requires changes in treaties, then you cannot let it stand inthe way of what needs to be done. What Europe needs to have is the flexibility of a network, not the rigidity of a block. It is a picture of Europe they recognise in Berlin at an online fashion retailer that has recently established a foothold in Britain. We think it would be a pity if it UK was to leave the EU. It is an important part of our business, selling to the British consumer and partnering British companies. Earlierthe mood in Poland was less positive. Mr Cameron and the Polish Prime Minister agreed the EU needed to be more competitive but she told him of her strong disagreement with any benefit cuts that might discriminate against Polish nationals in Britain. David Cameron’s aim is to make sure that when the negotiations begin in earnest at a summit next month everyone understands Britain’s position. As he found out today, getting everyone to agree to that position is quite another thing. A blanket ban on so-called legal highs has been proposed in a draft law. Anyone producing, selling or supplying mind-altering substances - except alcohol, tobacco and caffeine - would face up to seven years in jail. Legal highs have been linked to a number of deaths. Our home affairs correspondent, Daniel Sandford, has more. For nearly a decade now, high street shops and websites have been selling unlicensed, mind-altering drugs, marketing them as legal highs. But although not banned, they can be very dangerous. This was 11+-year-old Owen Vaughn just after he smoked one brand of legal high. Fortunately, he survived, reliving today the moment two months ago when he took the drug. Itjust hit me instantly and it was all fuzzy, my memory is fuzzy, but I remember my heart slowing down and hitting the floor and not being able to move or talk. And then, at that time, the police officers came over and gripped me, Itried running and just fell straight on my face. He was inthe ambulance, wired up to machines. He had a drip inside him, he was fitting. He was shaking and I asked the ambulance man, why is he shaking? They said, he is fitting, we need to go. And I’ve don’t want any other family to go through what we have been through. Both know it was a lucky escape. The Government has tried banning each legal high as it was invented. But at this Home Office lab, they have just seen new, slightly altered psychoactive substances appear to take the banned drugs’ places. Most of the substances sold in Britain are made in China, leaving the scientists here trying to catch up and identify them as they come on the market. So today, ministers took a dramatic new approach, publishing a bill to ban the sale of all mind-altering chemicals, except alcohol, tobacco, caffeine, medicines and food. But the owner of this Portsmouth shop said it won’t work. The government are trying to put a blanket ban on it. They will sweep it under the carpet and make it a criminal offence and that drives it underground. In truth no one knows if users will go back to taking legal substances like alcohol or turn to the drug dealers. Sepp Blatter faces a second round of voting inthe presidential election. Our children’s fruit snacks as healthy as they might seem? Coming UP healthy as they might seem? Coming up inthe sport the stage is set for the 131+th FA Cup final. Arsenal will be looking to win it for a record 12th time when they take on Aston Villa. Their terrible plight is plain to see but a way to help them, hard to find. Thousands of migrants fleeing Myanmar by boat, many of them persecuted as Rohingya Muslims, are at the mercy of people traffickers. Sometimes the smugglers simply abandon them at sea. Or they’re taken to dry land in neighbouring countries only to be imprisoned in camps and held for a ransom. No payment- no freedom. And stories of extraordinary brutality abound. Our International Correspondent Ian Pannell has been to Thai Malaysia border to find out more. His report contains disturbing first hand testimony. The wild borderla nds The wild borderlands of Malaysia. Where migrant dreams of a promised land didn’tjust vanish in Where migrant dreams of a promised land didn’t just vanish in the missed that they were crushed into the ground. These Muslims fled persecution in my in March and were brought to these camps. The men who promised to save them had them hostage in self. They were beaten, tortured, raped and many were killed. We are inthe deepjungle on the Malaysians Thai border. It’s the area that holds the darkest of secrets. There were more than 1+0 camps in this area and I’m standing in one of them. There are bits of wood tied together, makeshift, very little to protect people. Some people were kept in these areas for as long as two years. There were more than 1+0 camps believed to be hidden here. 11+0 bodies have been recovered and the prediction is that there could be hundreds more buried somewhere in thisjungle. We met some of those held in these camps. Abdul staggered out of the jungle withjust a pair of Abdul staggered out of the jungle with just a pair of shorts to his name. He had been held foran astonishing two years inthe name. He had been held foran astonishing two years in the jungle. As the police closed inthe traffickers fled and the migrants escape. Abdul has the face of a haunted man. He was starved, beaten and tortured. TRANSLATION: At the end of this month I will have been two years in this camp. We couldn’t PGY two years in this camp. We couldn’t pay the ransom money so we were tortured and kept there. They poured boiling oil on us. Sometimes they hanged people. Many people died in the place was covered with Graves. A lot of people died. The memories? They will be with them for ever. This lady loves her baby daughter but the little girl will always remind her of the jungle camps where she was raped by so many men that she doesn’t know who the father is. TRANSLATION: They beat and killed the boys and raped the girls who couldn’t give them money. Life is really bad in Myanmar and we can’t survive there. It’s hard to survive here. When we go out the police take money from us and sometimes we are arrested. We thought Malaysia would be better but it’s the same. She lives in the be better but it’s the same. She lives inthe shadows with other migrants fleeing hardships at home risking journeys at sea and suffering the horrors of the jungle camps and for what? They are not even people in their promised land. For those who have survived the camps there is neither dignity nor hope. She must beg on a bridge with her baby and other migrants from Myanmarjust to survive. Malaysia doesn’t class them as refugees. The UN stopped giving them papers and has failed to help her. They haven’t duelled the worst humanity can sink to. Yet still no one sees them and no one wants them. More on our More O1’! OUT ITI8l1’I MOVE OVI OUV VI’I8lVI VIEWS. More on our main news.

In therefore went to a second but per for voting could continue Prince Ali decided to withdraw. He knew there was no way he would win. He is out and Sepp Blatter has won. Four more years of Sepp Blatter. Despite all of those allegations of systematic corruption, quarter of a century involving the FBI and the arrests this week which plunged Fifa into fresh turmoil, Sepp Blatter lives up to his reputation as sports great survivor. He’s onstage now with a victory speech. It will come as a huge relief to his supporters and shows the power they see has managed to build up. It will upset many and they will see it as symbolic of all that’s wrong this organisation. Uefa will be encouraged regardless of this defeat that there’s the possibility of a boycott of the World Cup, vote of no-confidence in Sepp Blatter and maybe the sponsors will feel the need to pressure him again. Campaigners in Orkney have launched a legal attempt to overturn the action of Michael Carmichael as is MP after the former Scottish Secretary said he was behind the leak of a controversial memo of Nicola Sturgeon. james Cook is in Edinburgh. Who are these campaigners and are they likely to succeed? The lead campaigner says he is a member of the SNP that says he’s not doing this for any partisan reason. He is acting as a voter. As to whether it’s likely to succeed, it will be difficult to get across the legal hurdles and for them to prove which is what they will try to do, that he broke the representation of the people by effectively misleading his electric eye lying about the knowledge of this memo. Even if they can’t do this the political pressure may be more significant, the political pressure. His colleagues in the political pressure. His colleagues inthe Scottish Parliament face election next year and if they feel the saga will damage their reputation and chances of real action then they may be the one saying to him you need to have a by-election. Some children’s fruit smack is labelled as healthy contain more sugar than sweets. Some have the equivalent of four spoonfuls of sugar. There have been calls for sugar reduction targets to be sent to help reduce obesity. A healthy diet helps children get a good start in life, but making sure they eat lots of fruit and veg is not always easy. Fruit smacks, often coated in yoghurt, can be a handy answer but the parents know how much sugar they contain? I buy them because they have fruit. Are you aware of how much sugar they contain? Perhaps we should look more closely. They have pictures of fruit on so you think you’re doing a good thing. Some have added sugar and some don’t. You have to read the small print to find out which are the good ones in which aren’t. Do you like them? Experts warned that the sugars in these snacks is different to that which occurs naturally in fresh fruit. As soon as it starts to be processed you lose a lot of the nutrients within it and sometimes you consume larger quantities and a higher concentration. Searchers looked at 91+ fruit snacks products on sale and found that 85% of them contain more sugar than sweets. Some had more than four teaspoons per portion and 99% is would receive a red colour warning for high sugar content. Researchers say that a child who ate two of these fruits Max would have to work through all of these strawberries to contain the same amount of sugar. Manufacturer say that information is clearly marked and it’s parents to decide what they feed their kids. The sugar content is very clearly displayed on the packin is very clearly displayed on the pack in a nutrition table and it empowers consumers to make informed choices. Health campaigners say parents already find it hard enough to work out what is healthy for their kids and the packaging and content of these fruits Max doesn’t help. Lets have a look at the weather. Cool and changeable at the moment. Lots of cloud inthe Atlantic heading our way for tomorrow evening but the daytime weather is in a clear spot. Some strong winds and heavy rain across much of England and Wales early on. Sunshine and showers behind it. We could keep a few showers inthe north and west. The general trend is showers to become fewer and further between and a good setup for a chilly night. Particularly in rural spots. A chilly start to Saturday but it looks like the best of the two days. Dry and bright weather. One or two showers inthe north of Scotland. Elsewhere a decent day. It made cloud over from the South and West inthe advance of rain which should stay offshore. Maybe a notch up on today’s values and it should feel more pleasant. Through the evening it goes downhill turning increasingly wet and windy. It spreads across pretty much all parts inthe first part of Sunday. Starts off grey with fog on the hills. A windy start. Stick with it because it will brighten up from the West. We have rain working its way northwards. It might linger for a time inthe far northwards. It might linger for a time in the far south-east. You a few showers north and west that many places brighten up. Variable cloud and a bit of sunshine. Temperatures struggling.

Sepp Blatter has been re-elected President of Fifa, despite being at the helm during one of the biggest corruption scandals to rock world football. Mr Blatter secured another four years after his only rival, Prince Ali bin al-Hussein ofjordan, withdrew though he won enough support to force a second round of voting. Football’s world governing has become the subject of two criminal investigations in Switzerland and the US amid accusations of rampant corruption. In his acceptance speech in Zurich, Mr Blatter said he took full responsibility for restoring Fifa’s reputation. Our sports editor Dan Roan is there for us now. Despite the eve nts Despite the events of this week this was the result most people were expecting. I think so, yes. was the result most people were expecting. Ithink so, yes. Such expecting. I think so, yes. Such is the formidable power base that Sepp Blatter has managed to build up over his long reign it’s fair to say most of us predicted a victory for him today. Nonetheless, it will come as a huge disappointment to the many around the footballing world who hoped that the incredible crisis of the last few days would finally prove a tipping point and give football a fresh start. It wasn’t to be. Somehow he had done it again. Sepp Blatter tonight able to celebrate clinging to power. The 79-year-old living up to his reputation as sport’s great survivor having extended his scandal-rit regime into a fifth term. I thank you, I thank you that you accepted me, that for the next four years I will be in command of this boat called Fifa and we will bring it back. We will bring it back off shore. Earlier Blatter challenger, Prince Ali ofjordan arrived, hoping he could pull off one of the sport’s biggest ever results. Inside an early sign of the rankor that surrounds. Security, please. Protesters disrupting proceedings. Yesterday’s arrest of football officials plunging it into turmoil. Ali now vowing to restore the organisation’s battered reputation. We have heard questions raised about whether our family is morally bankrupt. If you give me the honour of your votes I will take full responsibility and hold myself accountable to all of you and to the world. Blatter meanwhile, pleading with his supporters in Africa and Asia for another chance. I would quite simply like to stay with you. I would like to stay with you. I would like to continue with you. With that, it was time for Fifa to decide. Eight delegate casting a vote in turn. Blatter polled 133 votes to 73. That was close enough to trigger a second round. But Ali withdrew. Blatter had prevailed, although opposition remains. This isn’t over by any means. The events of this week are so traumatic for Fifa that I cannot see Fifa reforming itself under Blatter. He has had 16 years to reform it. He hasn’t done it. The events of this week are so profound. If you listen to what the Attorney General in America said, this is the beginning and not the end. I think there is an awful lot more for this to play out. But for now having weathered the storm, Blatterwas But for now having weathered the storm, Blatter was left to bask in the glory of victory. The scandal he has survived, however, is set to linger on. Sepp Blatter may be approaching his 80th birthday, but as we’ve seen today, he hasn’t lost his drive for the job. Our sports correspondent Andy Swiss has been looking at Sepp Blatter, the man. His report contains flash photography. To his fans he is a visionary, comparable to Moses and Winston Churchill. To his critics he is a villain operating from a board room straight out ofjames Bond. Sepp Blatter’s ability to court controversy is matched only by his ability to survive it. Sepp Blatter. .. After his first election win in 1998 there were claims of vote buying, Blatter denied all knowledge. Qatar’s successful World Cup bid prompted more allegations of corruption. Blatter largely shrugged his shoulders. Crisis? What is a crisis? Now 79, Blatter has often seemed a man out of touch. He has claimed women footballers should wear tighter shorts, that racist incidents should be settled by a handshake, and made light of gay fans’ concerns about going to Qatar. I would say they should refrain from any sexual activities. But his commercial success is there to see, not least in Fifa’s very own feature film. You have everything you need to run our family. You know the slightest error and you are out. Yes, it’s Sepp Blatter all-action hero living to fight another day. After his last election win he returned to his home town for a victory party. For so long now football has danced to his tune, but those closest to him insist he is misunderstood. TRANSLATION: He is the most generous human being you can imagine. He is someone who will give you his last shirt. So he is not corrupt. He is someone who gives. And someone who is still in charge. Unstoppable, seemingly untouchable, for better or worse, perhaps football’s most important fixture. So how did Sepp Blatter, despite all the allegations of corruption at Fifa, manage to garner such a significant proportion of today’s vote? One reason, his patronage of the smaller footballing nations, who have benefitted hugely at grassroots level under his watch. Our Africa correspondent Andrew Harding has this report on Mr Blatter’s strategy. South Africa’s World Cup, the moment an entire continent had been waiting for. Organised in South Africa... The man who helped deliver it, Sepp Blatter, announcing the decision backin Blatter, announcing the decision back in 2001+. Now, of course, we hear allegations of bribery, that the vote was rigged. But in johannesburg today many refuse to believe that. Fifa has invested heavily here, training under way this afternoon on an expensive pitch in a poor township. We have this centre because of Fifa. Generally, they feel like Sepp Blatter takes care of Africa. So that’s why they support him. Fifa says it spent more than £1 billion investing in grass roots soccer here in Africa. Now some will say that’sjust roots soccer here in Africa. Now some will say that’s just Sepp Blatter buying votes. Others, that a lot of that money gets stolen. But there is no doubt that he has secured himself real gratitude and loyalty here. And it’s notjust Africa, all 209 Fifa members can receive development funding. Much of it through the goal programme which has supported 719 projects since its launch. 199 of them have been in Africa and range from football pitches to technical centres. The result, many countries, big and small, with good reason to back the status quo. So it’s a good strategy from Blatter? If the money was coming from Blatter’s pocket I would say so, but coming from Fifa, it’s for that reason that Blatter has been seen as a friend of Africa because it is under his leadership that Fifa has been looking after Africa. Forall sorts that Fifa has been looking after Africa. For all sorts of reasons then, Africa hasjust played an important role in winning Sepp Blatter yet another term as Fifa’s boss. Let’s go back to Dan Roan in Zurich. Sepp Blatter lives to fight on. What lies ahead for Fifa now? Despite the triumph and that giddy victory speech, never before perhaps has his grip on power felt so insecure. Tonight Uefa is in militant mood. There is talk of the nuclear option, a boycott of the World Cup, a vote of no confidence, an extraordinary general meeting. There is fresh pressure from high-profile multinational sponsors who want immediate action from Fifa. There is bound to be more controversy over the way that Qatar, the hosts of the 202 World Cup treats migrant workers. So severe was this crisis it laid bare tensions, Blatter’s victory perhaps something of a rebuke to the developing world. Then there are the criminal investigations here in Switzerland and the United States. Those investigations are set to be widened and authorities are bound to want to know exactly what Sepp Blatter knew about any wrongdoing over recent years. He may have prevailed today, but challenges most certainly lie ahead. Thank you. Other news now. David Cameron, visiting Angela Merkel in Berlin today, received a boost to his plans for EU reform when the German Chancellor said she wasn’t ruling out changes to existing European treaties. But there was a less positive response in Poland, about his idea to curb migrants’ rights to welfare as our deputy political editor james Landale reports. In Berlin today they pulled out all the stops. Guards of honour, yards of red carpet, and a warm hug and a kiss. He doesn’t get this everywhere. But this was not just a display of German respect for a newly elected Prime Minister, it was also the continent’s most powerful politician extending the hand of friendship towards a leader she wants in lockstep, notjust with her, but also the rest of Europe. So, after a quick lunch, Chancellor Merkeljoined David Cameron before the cameras and suggested she could do a deal with her guest over his plans to reform the European Union. TRANSLATION: We want to work closely together in the process that the UK is now going through towards a referendum. We would like to help in a constructive way. As I’ve said before, where there’s a will, there’s a way. And that’s quite something to say when Mr Cameron wants to cut migrants’ benefits, opt Britain out of ever closer union and give national parliaments new powers to block EU laws. What chance do you believe that David Cameron has in achieving his reforms, given the opposition that you and so many other leaders have towards the treaty changes that he’s seeking? TRANSLATION: If you are convinced of an idea, you can’t say that treaty change is an absolute impossibility. To a Prime Minister who has been told no so often, this, perhaps, was very welcome. I was very heartened by what the Chancellor said in terms of where there’s a will, there’s a way. If content requires changes in treaties, then you can’t let that stand in the way of what needs to be done. What Europe needs to be, it needs to have the flexibility of a network, not the rigidity of a block. Earlier, the mood in Poland was less positive. MrCameron and the Mr Cameron and the Polish Prime Minister agreed the EU needed to be more competitive. But she told him of her strong disagreement with any benefit cuts that might discriminate against Polish nationals in Britain. If we are talking about imposing certain solutions that are going to divide European citizens, and some of the proposals could be read in this way, then obviously we would be against. David Cameron’s aim on this grand tour of Europe is to make sure that when the negotiations begin in earnest at a summit next month, everybody understands Britain’s position. But, as he found out today, getting everybody to agree to that position is quite another thing. james Landale, BBC News, in Berlin. Our Europe editor Katya Adler is in Berlin for us tonight. This has been a week of shuttle diplomacy for the Prime Minister. Has it been a success? Well, when the most powerful woman in the world says were as well, there’s a way, and yes, treaty change could be possible, it must feel like success to David Cameron. This European tour served a definite purpose. Ita chance to rebuild EU bridges burned in the run-up to the election. He performed to the EU sceptic gallery at home while on business abroad. Before the negotiations begin, this was a chance for the Prime Minister to say to other ministers, this is not the UK against the rest of Europe, we do have a lot in common. When it comes to this, the most powerful EU country, Germany, the details of the trip are less important, because Chancellor Merkel importa nt, because Chancellor Merkel is important, because Chancellor Merkel is one for the big picture. She’s looking at Europe on the world stage. The European Union, without the British military, without the British economy, without British diplomatic expertise, is far weaker and more fragmented in the face of a ruthlessly ambitious China, and Russia just next door. I want to find a solution, said Angela Merkel today. Normally, in the EU, when Germany speaks, others follow. Their terrible plight is plain to see, but a way to help them is hard to find. Thousands of migrants fleeing Myanmar by boat, many of them persecuted as Rohingya Muslims, are at the mercy of people traffickers. Sometimes the smugglers simply abandon them at sea. Or they’re taken to dry land in neighbouring countries, only to be imprisoned in camps and held for a ransom. No payment, no freedom. And stories of extraordinary brutality abound. Our international correspondent Ian Pannell has been to the Thai-Malaysia border to find out more. His report contains disturbing first-hand testimony. The wild borderlands of Malaysia. Where migrant dreams of a promised land didn’tjust vanish in the mist, they were crushed into the ground. Rohingya Muslims fled persecution in Myanmar and were brought to these camps. But the men who promised to save them held them hostage instead. They were beaten, tortured, raped and many were killed. We’re in the deepjungle on the Malaysian-Thai border. This is the area that holds the darkest of secrets. There are more than 1+0 camps beleived to be in this area and I’m standing in one of them. It’s very makeshift. There are bits of wood tied together, makeshift shelters, very little to protect people. Some people were kept in these areas for as long as two years. There are more than 1+0 camps like this believed to be hidden in these woods. Nearly 11+0 bodies have been recovered and the prediction is that there could be hundreds more buried somewhere in thisjungle. We met some of those held in these camps. Abdul Hakim staggered out of the jungle this week with just a pair of shorts to his name. He had been held for an astonishing two years in the jungle. As the police closed in, the traffickers fled and the migrants escaped. Abdul Hakim has the face of a haunted man. He was starved, beaten and tortured. TRANSLATION: At the end of this month I would have been two years in this camp. We couldn’t pay the ransom money so we were tortured and kept there. They poured boiling oil on us. Sometimes the traffickers hanged people. A lot of people died and the place was covered with graves. A lot of people died. And the memories will be with them forever. Rashida loves her baby daughter but the little girl will always remind her of the jungle camps where she was raped by so many men that she doesn’t know who Ayisha’s father is. TRANSLATION: They beat and killed the boys and raped the girls who couldn’t give them money. Life is really bad in Myanmar and we can’t survive there. That’s why we left. But it’s hard to survive here, too. When we go out the police take money from us and sometimes we are arrested. We thought Malaysia would be better but it’s the same. So Rashida lives in the shadows with other migrants, fleeing hardships at home, risking journeys at sea, and suffering the horrors of the jungle camps - and for what? They’re non-people in their promised land. For those who survived the camps there is neither dignity nor hope. Rashida must beg on a bridge with her baby and other migrants from Myanmar, just to survive. Malaysia doesn’t class them as refugees. The UN stopped giving them papers and has failed to help her. They have endured the worst humanity can sink to. And yet still no-one sees them, and no one wants them. A brief look at some of the day’s other news stories: Campaigners in Orkney have launched a legal attempt to overturn the election of Liberal Democrat Alistair Carmichael as their local MP. It’s after the former Scottish Secretary admitted he was behind the leak of a controversial memo about the SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon during the election campaign. A teenager has beenjailed for eight years for grooming a young man with learning difficulties, to kill a British soldier. Kazi Islam, who’s 19, was inspired by the killing of Lee Rigby and tried to make his friend carry out a copycat attack. The Scottish artist jack Vettriano says he won’t be able to paint for the foreseeable future after suffering a shoulder injury. Hugely popular, some of his paintings sell for hundreds of thousands of pounds. A blanket ban on so-called legal highs has been proposed in a draft law. Anyone producing, selling or supplying mind altering substances - except alcohol , tobacco and caffeine - would face up to seven years injail. Legal highs have been linked to a number of deaths. Our Home Affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford has more. For nearly a decade now, high street shops and websites have been selling unlicensed, mind-altering drugs, marketing them as legal highs. But although not banned, they can be very dangerous. This was 11+-year-old Owen Vaughn just after he smoked one brand of legal high. Fortunately, he survived, reliving today the moment, two months ago, when he took the drug. Itjust hit me instantly and it was all fuzzy, my memory is fuzzy, but I remember my heart slowing down and hitting the floor, and not being able to move, walk, talk, nothing. And then, at that time, the police officers came over and gripped me, Itried running and just fell straight on my face. He was in the ambulance, wired up to machines. He had a drip inside him, he was fitting. He was shaking and I asked the ambulance man, ""Why is he shaking?"" They said, ""He’s fitting, we need to go"". And I don’t want any other family to go through what we’ve been through. Both know it was a lucky escape. The Government has tried banning each legal high as it was invented. But at this Home Office lab, they have just seen new, slightly altered psychoactive substances appear to take the banned drugs’ places. Most of the substances sold in Britain are made in China, leaving the scientists here trying to catch up and identify them as they come on the market. So, today, ministers took a dramatic new approach, publishing a bill to ban the sale of all mind-altering chemicals except alcohol, tobacco, caffeine, medicines and food. But the owner of this Portsmouth shop said it won’t work. The Government are literally, by trying to put a blanket ban on it, and they will sweep it under the carpet and make it a criminal OffâIâ1Câ foI’ 8I’1yoIâ1â oI’ âVâI’yoIâ1â. And itjust drives it underground. And, in truth, no one knows if users will go back to taking legal substances like alcohol or turn to the drug dealers. Daniel Sandford, BBC news.

What today shows is that people are not going to stand for having their quality of life diminished with the expansion of the airport. Pollution levels are already well over the EU limits here and the airport claim they can get them down within limits but all the evidence shows they cannot. We are committed to tackling air quality today and we recognise it is a significant issue. We have reduced emissions by 16% over the last five years. We are playing our role and if you look in the immediate facility of Heathrow, we do meet pollution limits. The challenge is to the north of the MA, away from the airport and the majority of the issue there is non-airport related road traffic. While the airports battle with each other, London’s Mayor continues to battle against the Airports Commission itself. It’s already ruled out his preferred option in the Thames Estuary, and City Hall is less than impressed with the consultation on air quality. It is a pretty shoddy piece of consultation actually buy the Airports Commission and I think Gatwick have a point. It will be extremely difficult for any expansion to Heathrow to be compliant with the government’s legal obligations on air quality. The Airports Commission is expected to make its decision in the coming weeks - selecting either Heathrow or Gatwick as its site for expansion. Then it is over to the politicians. The Chief Rabbi has described calls for a ban on women from driving as entirely removed from mainstream jewish practice. Ephraeem Mirvis was speaking after the Belz Hasidic group in Stamford Hill told parents that children driven to school by their mothers will be turned away at the gates. The Belz sect has defended its action, saying women driving goes against the laws of modesty. A man who raped a woman after she fell asleep on a night bus near Adlwych has been jailed for seven years. juan Calderon sexually assaulted the woman who had been on a night out with friends last October. He then took her off the bus and raped her. The second cyclist to be killed in 24 hours on the capital’s streets has been named as Esther Hartsilver. The physiotherapist was on her way to work when she was involved in an accident with a lorry in Camberwell. Meanwhile, a third cyclist was freed by dozens of passers-by who lifted a bus to get him out. Alex Bushill reports. Esther Hartsilver was 32 years old, one of two cyclists killed injust 24 hours. She was crushed by a lorry here, just down the road from Kings College Hospital where she worked as a physiotherapist. More than likely, she was on her daily commute. Even though she was taken to a hospital, Kings College Hospital which isjust 100 metres further up the road, it was not enough. She died from her injuries yesterday evening. This woman was opening up her florist at the time and noticed how bystanders rushed to her aid. She was being looked after, there were about four or five people around her, people had been calling the police and ambulances. I didn’t go anywhere too close because it looked like everything was in hand. We gave her some towels and stuff to try to stop the bleeding. Others too rushed to the aid of a rider in Walthamstow yesterday evening. These extraordinary scenes captured the moment around 100 Londoners helped to free a man, by lifting the bus he was trapped under. He had been riding a unicycle on the high street. Tonight, he is still being treated in hospital. A third cyclist, a woman in her 50s was also killed yesterday in Walton-on-Thames. It means in all, six cyclists have now died this year in London. And every death has involved a HGV. A fact I put to those responsible for ensuring our roads were made safe. We are spending just under £1 billion in the next eight or nine years on a whole variety of measures. We are making sure that all existing lorries that come in to London after 1st September will have basic safety equipment that includes mirrors so the drivers can see out, and side guards to stop people being caught under the wheels but we are also working with both the construction industry and the vehicle manufacturers to bring forward very quickly, new safety features. Cycle campaigns welcome those improvements, like more segregated lanes being built here at Elephant and Castle. But they insist more needs to be done and more quickly. Of the 33 junctions identified for improvements, we believe only nine will be completed by the end of this Mayor’s term, so that’s May, next year. I don’t think that is good enough, I think Transport for London need to move much faster and do much more to address risk at these dangerous junctions. Clearly, the more that can be done, the less likely others will be killed. For those who knew and loved Esther Hartsilver, an overriding memory remains, that simply, of her smile. That’s it from me. Let’s get the weather forecast now from Nick. A lot of people wondering and hoping tomorrow won’t be as wet as today. We always have hope! Let me reward that hope with the story for tomorrow. This is the best day of the weekend. Between now and then we have a chilly night. It’s under way, the last chance of showers diminishing, clear skies, breeze easing a bit, as well. Some of us heading to low single figures as Saturday begins. A fresh start, a bright start. Don’t expect blue sky all day long. Cloud will build, it will be grey at times. But it’s dry, it is disappointingly cool. Sunday will be, no chance, look at this to start the day. More rain coming through. It’s windy, but don’t write off Sunday because by the afternoon it’s drying up and eventually late in the day it starts to brighten up, as well. That’s your weekend. Saturday is the best day. On Sunday, morning rain clearing. What about the rest of the UK? Here isjay. Good evening. The weather has been UP Good evening. The weather has been up and down over the last few days. It will continue like that to the early part of next week. Out to the Atlantic, this cloud is heading our way later tomorrow. The bulk of the weather tomorrow is coming from this clear slot which is coming in behind this massive cloud which brought rain across much of England and Wales earlier. Showers followed. We still have showers overnight but they tend to fade from most areas. Then the skies will be clear for many and the winds light and that’s a set-up for a chilly night. Rural spots, particularly North Wales and northwards go to the bottom end of single figures. A touch of frost on the grass first thing. A chilly start to a Dean day. Maybe -- the grass first thing. A chilly start to a Dean day. Maybe -- to a decent day. In Scotland more cloud here and a few sharp showers. For many it’s a decent day. Although in the afternoon we begin to see the cloud slowly thickening up across the south-west of England and pushing further north. Might see rain from that but most of us won’t. Temperatures probably up on today’s values. The winds lighter and a better feel to things. It is a much better day for the second Test at Headingley. Few, ifany, interruptions through the day. Might turn cloudy into the afternoon. Might get above 13 for the Scottish Cup final. No problems with the weather here and no real problems for the FA Cup final. just a bit of cloud in the sky. Should stay dry. This rain will turn things wet and windy across the western side of the UK through the evening. That rain transfers eastwards. Fog on the hills, as well. So a grey start to Sunday. Wet and windy too. Stick with it and it should brighten up from the west. Let’s look at Sunday. There is that rain moving northwards and eastwards. It will take longer to clear from the north of Scotland. Wet and windy here. Showers follow that to the western side of Scotland and north-west of England and Northern Ireland. Elsewhere, it’s a reasonable afternoon. Variable cloud. Brighterweather reasonable afternoon. Variable cloud. Brighter weather but temperatures cloud. Brighter weather but temperatures struggling for most of us. Next week it turns increasingly wet and windy through Monday and into Tuesday. Things will slowly settle down from mid-week onwards. As it settles down it looks like things will turn that little bit warmer. Something This programme contains some strong language. On tonight’s show, the star of the new dinosaur film, jurassic World.

David Cameron says he won’t bargain away a referendum on Europe if he falls short of an outright victory in the General Election. In an interview with the BBC, he pledges that if he can’t deliver a vote on Europe, he won’t hold on to power. I’m confident that in four days time we will win those 23 seats, have that majority, but come what may, I will not be Prime Minister of a government that does not deliver that referendum. Set in stone, Labour spells out its election promises, literally, to try to woo undecided voters. And with Nick Clegg setting out his terms for any new coalition deal, we’ll bring you the latest in the battle for Number 10. The hundred million dollar man, Floyd Mayweather bags the biggest cheque in boxing after his victory over Manny Pacquiao. And who’s boring now? Chelsea answer their critics by winning their first Premier League title in five years. Good evening. The Prime Minister has told the BBC he won’t ""bargain away"" a referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU if the Conservatives ""fall short"" of a majority in Thursday’s General Election. David Cameron said he wouldn’t be Prime Minister ""come what may"" in a government that didn’t deliver that referendum. He’s been speaking to our Political Editor, Nick Robinson. If you go back into number ten on Friday, are we guaranteed two years of uncertainty about Britain’s most important economic relationship, our membership of the EU? If that isn’t chaos and instability, what is? The right thing to do with Europe is have a strategy and plan for securing Britain’s future and that’s what I have. I say to renegotiate, get a better deal and put that to the British people in a referendum. We have seen this before, those who rememberjohn Major and the war betweenjohn Redwood and Ken Clarke, we know what this is like. Why should we relive it? I say the right thing to do is for Britain to have a new chance for a decisive say over our future in new chance for a decisive say over ourfuture in Europe. Most people in this country want that, we have sole many treaties and powers passed from Westminster to Brussels, it’s now time to make a change, have a better approach for Britain in Europe and let the British people decide. You only get that if I am Prime Minister after the 7th of May. If you don’t get the deal and Winnie referendum, what is plan B? I’m confident we will get the deal. People said I would not cut the budget, I cut it. People said I would never veto a treaty and I did. People who know me, know that I have a strong record of negotiating in Europe. Plan B is to hold a referendum. Plan B is you don’t know. You may have a negotiation you can’t succeed in and a vote to lose and Britain will be out of the EU. The only thing you have to beat clear about is to have a plan for the changes you want, which I have been clear about. The referendum will then take place and I have said I am confident we will get those changes and I am confident Britain will stay in a reformed European Union. People know that is mY European Union. People know that is my aim and goal. The real point is, if you do not have a plan for Europe, Britain will drift towards the exit. Other parties are sticking their heads in the sand thinking the issue will go away. It won’t. It is time for decisive action and leadership. You have been clear that without a referendum you will not be leader and Prime Minister. Are you saying he would rather Ed Miliband be Prime Minister and saying he would rather Ed Miliband be Prime Ministerand Labouraround the country than stay on as Prime Minister without an EU referendum? People will worry that if we were to fall short, this would be something that could be bargained away. I want to be clear with people that will not happen. I will not lead a government that does not have that referendum in law and carried out. So if Nick Clegg were to say that he supports you and everything else other than this, you would say, no deal, Ed Miliband, you have a go at forming government? It would be strange for Nick Clegg to do that. Until recently this was his policy. I’m confident will stop I’m confident that in four days time we will win the 21+ seats and have that majority. But come what may I will not be Prime Minister of a government that does not deliver that referendum. And in the last of his interviews with the three main Westminster party leaders, our Political Editor Nick Robinson will be speaking to the Labour leader Ed Miliband on Tuesday. Well, with the polls suggesting no party winning an overall majority on Thursday, the various parties’ positions on Europe could be crucial in the days ahead. Here’s our Political Correspondent Ben Wright to explain where they stand. It’s one of the big choices on the ballot paper, this Thursday. Some parties guarantee a referendum on Britain’s and Bishop of Europe but others do not. The issue could dominate any hung parliament haggling between the parties. The Lib Dems want Britain rooted in Europe, but would hold an in-out referendum if any new powers were switched from the UK to Brussels. Today Nick Luck was asked if he would back a Conservative government that promised to vote on EU and the ship, May. Would you let David Cameron have the referendum in 2017? Before I address anyone else’s red lines I will address mine. We take that as a maybe. Ukip once Britain out of Europe. Like the DUP in Northern Ireland, they say there must be a referendum. Nigel Farage has said he will make sure David Cameron delivers. If he held that referendum on his own without Ukip holding his feet to the fire, I’m not confident it would be a full, free and fair referendum. It was partly the rise of Ukip and pressure from Tory MPs that drove David Cameron to first promised a referendum in 2013. His plan is to first ago she ate a new deal between Britain and the European Union. -- first to negotiate. Things like the benefits migrants can claim will be part of a new package. The deal will be put to voters at by 2017. The question will be, to stay in the European Union or girl. Last week the EU Commissioner, said he would give Britain two years to deliver a new deal. He said it has little time to deliver a deal that looks like real change. These six pledges are now carved in stone. All parties are now trying to win your trust. Labour has unveiled a plan to write its key manifesto policies in stone. The party says it guaranteeing no powers will go to Europe without a referendum. We will see if David Cameron is reinstalled as Prime Minister, the same kind of chaos, uncertainty and instability that we saw in the premiership ofjohn Major from 1992 when the Conservative Party completely fell apart over the issue of Europe. But it is quite possible that next week sees the start of a process that puts Britain’s future in Europe to the test. Europe has not featured so far but it could feature in who forms the next government. After all this campaigning the two main parties are deadlocked in the polls. That’s why there is all this discussion about deals and negotiations and who might talk to who. Europe will be very important to David Cameron if he finds itself short of majority in the Commons. His potential allies are the DUP in Northern Ireland who say they will only work with a government to who promises a referendum. Nick Clegg was leaving the door ajar today to agreeing to David Cameron’s plan in 2017. A significant intervention by the Lib Dem leader. And if Ukip have one or two seats they could be potential allies for the Prime Minister. The issueis allies for the Prime Minister. The issue is essential for all of them. Fascinating that David Cameron said he is determined to deliver that referendum, it is not negotiable during any hung parliament discussions, but it proves once again that Europe is at stake in this election. Ed Miliband has pledged that if he wins power, he won’t seek re-election if he fails to cut university tuition fees in England by 2020. He said Nick Clegg had ""betrayed"" a promise to oppose an increase in fees, and that unlike him, he wouldn’t break his word. If I had done what he did five years ago, I don’t think I could ask for your trust again. I will cut tuition fees from £9,000 to £6,000, and I tell you this, if I fail in this task I will not stand here again in 2020 making more promises. I will not be standing for the office of Prime Minister at all. In a little over an hour’s time the four Scottish Party leaders will take part in a final debate in Edinburgh. Our Scotland Correspondent james Cook is outside the debate hall now. ~ I have popped inside, Scotland has 59 seats in the House of Commons. There are just 59 seats in the House of Commons. There arejust six There are just six Scottish National Party MPs at the moment and they have never had more than 11 in the party’s history but polls suggest they could be on course to sweep to victory across the country. That could mean in a tight election the SNP have a big say in who becomes Prime Minister. Is Scotland’s political landscape shifting? Nicola Sturgeon believes thatit shifting? Nicola Sturgeon believes that it is. Her eyes are fixed on a new horizon, a big say for the SNP in running the UK, a country her party wants to leave. These are absolutely stunning. So are the polls. A week ago the SNP leader had never flown in a helicopter. But in Scotland these days, everything is UP Scotland these days, everything is up in the air. No one can remember a campaign like this. Is this a revolution? Is that’s what’s happening? Scotland rejected independence last year but now the SNP is more popular than ever. My job is to persuade people what we have in Scotland right now is special and should be nurtured, regardless of how people vote or voted in the referendum, and we have an opportunity on Thursday to unite as a country to make our voice heard and I think we should seize it with both hands. In town squares and high streets across Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon is greeted like this, by enthusiastic crowds hungry for change. But there is a desire for a quieter Scotland as well that worries where this is heading. The Scottish Labour leader took time out today for a charity football match. jim Murphy knows his team could face a thrashing and the final whistle is fast approaching. I’m looking forward to Thursday, when real Scots come out to vote, end all the helicopter rides and all the fanfare, and we have big decisions. Do we want David Cameron to stay or go? Scott ‘s are crying gap for change and we need to shake things up. Tonight in this hall the Scottish leaders come face-to-face for the final debate of the campaign. The Liberal Democrats say they offer stability, unity and decency. Conservatives offer a strong decency. Conservatives offer a strong economy in a strong UK. But it’s the battle between Labour and the SNP which could decide this election.

Italy’s coastguard says more than 3,500 migrants have been rescued from boats off the coast of Libya in the past 21+ hours. All are being brought back to Italy, with some reaching the island of Lampedusa overnight.

Football, and Chelsea have won the Premier League this afternoon. The Blues lifted their first title in five years with a 1-0 victory over London rivals Crystal Palace. Katie Gornall is at Stamford Bridge for us this evening. Chelsea have won the title with three games to spare. Having been top orjoint top all season. The critics will say they have done it without the same style and swagger of previous champions, but whatever you thing about the type of football Chelsea play, you have to admire their consistency. This has been a lesson in how to close out a title race. Well before kick-off at Stamford Bridge there was a feeling that today would be the day. It seems every man and his dog believed Chelsea would win the league after a season in which they have led from the front. But Crystal Palace are no pushovers, research and under Alan Pardew, they had chances early on and they shout for a handball waved away by the referee. So often when Chelsea needed a breakthrough, Eden Hazard has provided it. His surge into the area won a questionable penalty and a spot kick to match. Thankfully for Chelsea he kept his cool to score at the second attempt. Relief all round. A late chance from Wilfried Zaha threatened to delay the Coronation, but Chelsea, as they have done all season, stood strong. Now the celebrations could really begin. A classic Chelsea victory, resilient and ruthless. The third title Mourinho has masterminded at the bridge. A special victory for a special one.

Floyd Mayweather endorses his status as an all-time great. Afterwards there was controversy, Pacquiao’s camp complaining he had been denied medical treatment for a shoulder injury that prevented him using his right hand. Officials saying the request came too late. Ifought a good fight, did my best, and I think the people are very happy, because even though I hurt my shoulder, I did not complain in the ring. Mayweather, meanwhile, confirmed afterwards he intended to fight one last time, but refused to say whether he would consider a rematch. After boxing’s most lucrative bout, only Floyd Mayweather leaves here with reputation enriched. Given the frenzied hype that surrounded the build-up to this fight, it perhaps failed to live up to all expectations, but it did at least confirm the American as one of the sports all-time greats. There’s more throughout the evening on the BBC News Channel, we are back with the late news at 10. Now on BBC1 it’s time for the news where you are. Goodbye. Hello and welcome to BBC London News. I’m Chris Rogers. The Mayor, Borisjohnson, says the Conservatives are the best party to tackle inequality, providing the conditions to create more wealth. With just four days to voting, they still trail Labour in the polls in the capital, despite pushing their message of a recovering economy. This report from our Political Editor Tim Donovan. London’s mayor says the promise of economic stability will bring voters back to the Tories. And he will reject suggestions that welfare changes like the cut to housing benefit have been pushing poorer Londoners to the outskirts and that there hasn’t been enough affordable housing. In this mayoralty we will have had built more affordable homes, Tim, than the previous mayoralty did. We are on target to build notjust more homes than ever before, but a record number of affordable homes. Half a millionjobs have been created in five years but food banks have also appeared. The Tory’s key policies are designed to appeal to middle earning Londoners. There will be no inheritance tax on estates worth up to £1 million. The 40% higher rate of income tax will kick in at £50,000. The proposal for no income tax on the first £12,500 of earning is one which helps the better off than most. the better off the most. Low-income individuals do not benefit from an income tax cut because their income is too low. Partly because that has always been true, partly because a success of the coalition’s policy to increase the personal allowance to ÂIo,000 per year. The group that benefits most are two-earner couples, they can benefit twice over from the increase in personal allowance. But the mayor insists you don’t reduce inequality by constraining wealth creators. We want to have a dynamic economy because we think that is how to pay for strong public services. The two things are entirely indivisible. It’s only if you have a strong economy that you can put the money into people’s pockets which will enable them to change their lives. He rules out standing down as mayor before the end of his term next May but he does not rule out either excepting a cabinet post or pursuing the Tory leadership, whichever scenario may arise, if not next week, perhaps soon after. Police are investigating the death of a wealthy Middle Eastern man, found dead in his room at the Dorchester hotel. The Met says the death of the man in his 40s remains unexplained, though it has not ruled out murder. Two men aged 31 and 50 and both from west London have been arrested. A rugby league match at the London Skolars New River Stadium in Tottenham was abandoned today after a player collapsed with suspected cardiac arrest. Dannyjones, who was on the pitch for the visiting team Keighly Cougars, collapsed after coming off in the second minute of the game. He received treatment at the ground for an hour from London’s Air Ambulance before being taken to hospital. A demonstration has been held in Brixton to show solidarity with the people of Baltimore, following the death of Freddie Grey last month. He died a week after suffering a serious spinal injury in the back of a police van. Charlotte Franks reports. They are marching with one purpose, justice for the men and women who died, eitherat justice for the men and women who died, either at the hands of the police or in custody. On their banners, the names of those they are remembering. We are calling for the community to come together, stand up and say enough is enough, we need to stop these police killings from happening. Today, family, friends and supporters are demanding answers. I think people are furious and horrified that this has been allowed to happen. The police have been off the leash and feel they can kill with impunity. Internationally we have to get together and make sure these kinds of police executions stop. As well as remembering those in London, people have gathered in Brixton to march in solidarity with the family of Freddy Gray and his name appears on some banners. Freddie died in police custody in Baltimore last month. CHANTING justice! Six police officers have been charged in connection with his death but they deny any wrongdoing. I think it’s a positive step forward but there is still a long way to go. We still have to get to a conviction and after that Baltimore needs to change a lot from the ground up. The death of Freddy Gray is the latest in a catalogue of controversial incidents in America, black youths in conflict with white police officers. Riots and protests have followed. In sum of 2011 the shooting of Mark Duggan by a police officer here resulted in riots across the capital. Protesters today neither condones nor criticise the violence but are united in their view that they should take whatever steps necessary to make their voices heard. And let’s take a look at the weather now, with Elizabeth Rizzini. Good evening, we could still catch one or two showers in the next couple of hours or so, some of them might turn out to be heavy and thundery but they will gradually fade away into the night to leave us with a dry second half of the night, quite mild to start the day off, around nine or 10 degrees. Tomorrow, bank holiday Monday, and it will be dry, some lovely sunshine throughout the morning and early afternoon. Cloud seeping in from the south into the late afternoon, temperatures of 18 or 19 Celsius. Doing very well in the sunshine but it will not be as close or blustery. Heavy rain on Monday night into Tuesday, rather damp unsettled start to the new working week. We will be back after the 10pm news. Good evening. Hail, thunder and gusty winds, hill snow and lightning. There has been a lot going on with the weather today but tomorrow it will be much calmer. For most bank holiday Monday promises a fine day on the dry with sunny spells. Before then, still some downpours tonight. Rain across Wales, the Midlands and big showers through Northern Ireland and that band will push into Scotland as well. The weather turns dry through the second half of the night, temperatures down to single figures. The West and Rowell areas, possibly just two or three Celsius. But a dry and bright day tomorrow, rain across the far north of Scotland tomorrow, lingering in Shetland. Some showers across the West of Northern Ireland. The cloud will increase across the South but for the vast majority it is dry, fine and with sunshine around. Brighterand is dry, fine and with sunshine around. Brighter and warmer than today. Sunny spells and a few showers across western parts of Northern Ireland but for most of England and Wales it is a fine day with cabbages climb into the high teens. Some rain across the South with showers potentially across Devon and Cornwall and the Channel Islands. That weather will move across the Channel, quite a wet end to bank holiday WATER CHURNS Churchill was a powerful leader, you were there right behind him. CHURCHILL: 'The German war is at an end.' 'Today is Victory in Europe Day.' The war is over, we’re going to enjoy it now. Let’s have a party. I don’t know why I wasn’t rushing around, kissing soldiers, but I wasn’t! My father came back from the war as a superstar. We were free. ",,

In an interview with the BBC, he pledges that if he can’t deliver a vote on Europe, he won’t hold on to power. |,m I’m confident that in four days’ time, we’ll win the 23 seats, we’ll have the majority, but come what may, I will be not be Prime Minister of a Government that doesn’t deliver that referendum. Set in stone, Labour spells out its election promises literally to try to woo undecided voters. And with Nick Clegg setting out his terms for any new coalition deal, we’ll bring you the latest in the battle for Number Ten. Also tonight: Thousands more rescued as Italian coastguards say people-smugglers are taking advantage of mild weather to traffic migrants to Europe. Investigating the Arctic ice pack, we have a special report. This is one of the most dramatic journeys I’ve ever made. A while ago, we saw an area where the frozen sea broke up into what looked like pieces of a shattered mirror. And who’s boring now? Chelsea answer their critics by winning their first Premier League title in five years. Good evening. The Prime Minister has told the BBC he will not lead a Government that isn’t committed to a referendum on Britain’s EU membership. David Cameron has pledged to renegotiate the terms of Britain’s place in Europe and to hold a referendum by the end of 2017, if the Conservatives win power. He said today that he wouldn’t bargain away that promise in any coalition talks after the election on Thursday. David Cameron also repeated his warning about a Labour-SNP alliance. He’s been speaking to our Political Editor, Nick Robinson. There is flash photography coming up. The race is on. The finish line is in sight. But we are still no clearer who the winner will be. Today, David Cameronjoined the crowds watching the Tour De Yorkshire. His message on the election’s final lap - choose the Conservatives or end up with chaos. But when I spoke to him, I suggested that his pledge to re-open the question of Britain’s membership of the EU could produce just that. If you go back into Number Ten on Friday, aren’t we guaranteed two years of uncertainty about Britain’s most important economic relationship, our membership of the EU? The right thing to do with Europe is to have a strategy and plan for securing Britain’s future. That’s what I have. I’m saying, let’s renegotiate, get a better deal and then have that put to the British people in an in-out referendum. But hold on, this lot have got to agree to any deal he wants. Even if 27 other EU leaders do sign up, what if the British people say no? And if you don’t get the deal and win the referendum, what is Plan B for Britain? I’m confident we’ll get the deal. What is Plan B? People said you will never cut the EU budget, I cut it, people said you would never veto a treaty, I vetoed the treaty. People know I have a strong record of negotiating in Europe. What is Plan B? To hold a referendum. That means you don’t know. You may have a negotiation that you can’t succeed in, a vote you lose and Britain will be out of the EU? The only thing you have to be clear about is to have a plan for the changes you want, which I’ve been clear about. The other parties are sticking their head in the sand thinking this issue will go away. It won’t. Will David Cameron’s promise of an EU referendum survive if his party falls short of outright victory? Are you saying I would rather Ed Miliband was Prime Minister, I would rather Labour ran the country than stay on as Prime Minister without a guaranteed EU referendum? I’m saying that people would worry that were we to fall short, and I don’t believe we will, but were we to, this is something that can be bargained away and I want to be absolutely clear with people that that will not happen. It’s the ever upward rise of Nicola Sturgeon that gives the Tories hope they can still win. The SNP are taking votes from Labour in Scotland and helping the Conservatives to win them in England. Without the rise of Nicola Sturgeon, David Cameron would already be packing his bags. You are utterly dependent on them doing well for your own personal survival I don’t accept that. What’s happening in Scotland is a calamity for Labour and that’s not my responsibility. If the SNP do well, would it be ""Ajockolypse now"". I use my own... Boris is a very important part of your campaign. Is it appropriate? Boris has his own way, very colourful expresses and I leave them to Boris. But his language, your warnings talk of puppets, talk of illegitimacy, are you not threatening the future of your own country to preserve your own job? I’m saying the best way to save the country is to have a Government that would work for the whole of the United Kingdom, that is not reliant on nationalists from one part of it and that is a Conservative majority Government. This potential alliance of people wanting to break up the country and people wanting to bankrupt the country is incredibly dangerous for our country and that’s why I’m warning so vigorously people have four days to stop it. I’ve got the answer, which is, if you vote Conservative, it won’t happen. Back at Number Ten, they are touching the place up for whichever party or collection of parties will form our next Government. Whether it’s David Cameron or Ed Miliband who stands on the front step next, the country’s very future, as a United Kingdom in Europe, is going to be at stake. And in the last of our interviews with the three main Westminster party leaders, our Political Editor Nick Robinson will be speaking to the Labour leader Ed Miliband on Tuesday. Well, with the polls suggesting no party winning an overall majority on Thursday, the various parties’ positions on Europe could be crucial in the days ahead. Here’s our Political Correspondent Ben Wright to explain where they stand. It’s one of the big choices on the ballot paper this Thursday. Some parties guarantee a referendum on Britain’s referendum of Europe, others do not. The issue could dominate any hung Parliament haggle between the parties. The Lib Dems want Britain rooted in Europe. But they would hold an in-out referendum if any new powers are switched from the UK to Brussels. Today, Nick Clegg was asked if he would back a Conservative Government that promised a vote on EU membership come what may. Would you let David Cameron have his referendum in 2017, yes or no? Before I address anyone else’s red lines, I will address mine. We’ll take that as a maybe. Ukip, like the DUP, insist there should be a referendum and Nigel Farage says he would make sure David Cameron delivers. If he held that referendum on his own without Ukip holding his feet to the fire, I am not confident it would be full, free and fair. Ukip’s rise changed the game and pressured David Cameron to promise an in-out referendum back in 2013. His plan is to first negotiate a new deal between Britain and the European Union. Things like new limits on the benefits EU migrants can claim would be part of a package. The deal would be put to voters by the end of 2017. The question then, to stay in the European Union or go? Labour says it guaranteed no powers would go to Europe without a referendum but insists it can get reforms without one. We will see if David Cameron is reinstalled as Prime Minister is the same kind of chaos, instability and uncertainty we saw during the premiership ofjohn Major from 1992 when the Conservative Party completely fell apart over the issue of Europe. But it’s quite possible that next week sees the start of a process that puts Britain’s future in Europe to the test. Ed Miliband has found a novel way of promising voters that he’ll stick to his party’s promises. He’s had his campaign pledges engraved on a tablet of limestone that’s eight foot tall. If he wins, he says he’ll install it in the back garden of Number Ten to remind him of the party’s manifesto promises. Lucy Manning has been following the Labour Leader. Carved in stone or as Ed Miliband’s political opponents are dubbing it, the Ed stone. He unveiled Labour’s pledges on an eight foot slab of limestone that will, if ehe wins, sit in the Downing Street garden. They are carved in stone because they won’t be abandoned after the general election. I want the British people to remember these pledges, to remind us of these pledges. Today, in Worcester, he defended what some are calling the six commandments. Do you think it’s a bit presum shows to be putting an eight foot slab in Downing Street? Looks, I’m going to leave the landscape gardening part of this to other people. I don’t measure the curtains or the garden, but what I am determined to do is, I’m not going to put an expiry date on my promises marked May 8th. Carving the pledges into stone is supposed to be Labour’s way of saying, you can trust us, but it’s opened the party up to some ridicule. This was the Tory’s mocked UP ridicule. This was the Tory’s mocked up version of Labour’s tablet of stone, others compared him to Moses. Putting up an 8’6"" stone monument in the Downing Street garden, I think if you have got a problem with judgment, I don’t think that’s going to help. But maybe there’s no such thing as bad publicity. Labour today wanting to highlight its commitment not to break promises on lower tuition fees. Mr Miliband said he’d resign if he did. With a hug from wife justine, resign if he did. With a hug from wifejustine, it’s wife justine, it’s the voters who must decide if these are concrete plans. Fishes say people smugglers are taking advantage of mild weather and calm seas to send more boats into the Mediterranean. james Reynolds reports. These calm waters explain why so many migrants have tried to cross the Mediterranean this weekend. Here, the Italian coastguards picked up one boat full of migrants. An official instructs everyone to stay on board. And he takes a child to safety. He, at night, Italy rescues another crowded vessel. Two young women cling to one another. Others begin to celebrate before they’re even off their boats. One by one, the coastguard tells them. But they can barely wait. Thank you Italy, this man says. This weekend, Italy has coordinated more than 16 ships in its rescue effort, including a French vessel operating with the EU. In April, around 1,000 migrants died in two big shipwrecks. Human rights groups called on the European Union to reinstate the search and rescue mission it scaled down in November. The EU has responded by tripling the funding of its current Border Force. The continent is still trying to find a lasting way of dealing with the problem which may only get worse. Many thousands of migrants will take advantage of the next four or five months of good weather to attempt that crossing and the increase in funding for the that crossing and the increase in funding forthe EU funding for the EU fund search and rescue mission may save some lives, but beyond that, the underlying problems remain. Migrants will risk their lives to get here to Europe and right now, the EU has no effective way of preventing them from starting theirjourney. More than 7,000 people are now thought to have died as a result of last weekend’s earthquake in Nepal. Officials warn this number could rise further as rescuers I’â8Ci’I ITIOFE I’âITIolâ BFEBS.

The Arctic is changing and could even be entering a new era, according to a team of scientists. They’ve spent the winter aboard a boat deliberately wedged into the Arctic ice pack to see how rising temperatures are affecting it. Our Science Editor, David Shukman, is the only British journalist to join them aboard the Lance as it drifts with the ice 300 miles north of Longyearbyen. Our route to the north takes us over the Fyords in the high Arctic. This is the last land we’ll see for several days and the scenery is majestic. This is one of the most dramaticjourneys I’ve ever made where, a little while ago, we saw an area where the frozen sea had broken UP area where the frozen sea had broken up into what looked like pieces of a shattered mirrorjust lying on the surface. Soon, we are over the ocean.ment in recently, this would have been covered in ice at this time of the year. An hour later, we reach the edge of the ice pack and down below, running over the snow, the unmistakeable sight of a polar bear. Then, we reach our destination. A Norwegian research vessel, deliberatelyjammed in the ice all winter so scientists can investigate how this region is changing. First impression, having just got off the helicopter is a great cloud of steam every time I exhale. It’s like stepping into a deep freeze, minus 19, home for the next few days. So 500 miles from the North Pole in this tiny outpost of humanity, researchers are exploring the state of the ice and of the wildlife and we’ll be reporting on what they’re minding out. -- wildlife and we’ll be reporting on what they’re minding out. -- finding out. We’ll have more from David on his time in the Arctic on the 10 o’clock news tomorrow. Now time for the sport with Olly Foster. Thank you. We’ll start with football. Two games in the Premier League today. Match Of The Day is coming up later with the goals, but if you would like to see the story of how Chelsea won the title, here is Katie gore national who was at Stamford Bridge today. Match day scarves. .. Well before kick off at Stamford Bridge, there was a feeling that today would be the day. It seems every man and his dog believed Chelsea would win the league after a season in which they have led from the front. Their Leading Light on the pitch has Hazard and he provided the breakthrough, winning a questionable penalty he struck straight at Speroni but followed up to head in the rebouven. Palace had chanced but Chelsea stood strong, the single goal enough to deliver jose Mourinho’s third title in his two spells in charge, a special win for the special one. And that is it. Chelsea playersjump for the special one. And that is it. Chelsea players jump forjoy. Chelsea players jump for joy. Finally Chelsea players jump forjoy. Finally mathematically we are champions and in this moment we can breathe, we can relax, we can enjoy. He’s a serial winner. He identified what needed to be addressed and he addressed it. Other managers in and around him didn’t. That’s why he’s the best manager. Their critics will say they haven’t done it with 2 style and swagger of previous champions but whatever you think about the type of football Chelsea play, you have to admire their ruthlessness. This really has been a lesson in how to close out a title race. There is been tragic news in Rugby League this evening. The Wales international Dannyjones has died in hospital after suffering a suspected cardiac arrest during a match today for his club side Keighley cougars, he was 29. The richest fight in the history of boxing didn’t quite match the hype but Floyd Mayweatherer’s unbeaten record is intact after he beat Pacquiao in points. Dan Rowan is in Las Vegas. It was a Floyd Mayweather master class. The winner celebrating a famous victory having shown precisely why he remains unbeaten after 1+8 fights. I knew in my heart that I was beating him easy. I had to at least give him three rounds out of the 12, but he was applying pressure but he wasn’t landing any punches. It was about the world had waited years to see, but the American took control immediately. Crowd favourite Pacquiao responded, the Filipino forcing his opponent backwards at times by Mayweather could always rely on his renowned defensive genius, using hisjab to great effect. Floyd Mayweather endorses his status as an all-time great. Afterwards, Pacquiao’s camp complained he’d been denied medical treatment for a shoulder injury that preevened him from using his right hand. Fishes saying the request came too late. I put up a good fight. I did my best and I think the people are very happy because even though I hurt my shoulder, I didn’t complain in the ring. Mayweather meanwhile confirmed he intended to fight one last time, refusing to say whether he’d consider a rematch. After boxing’s most lucrative bout, only Floyd Mayweather leaves here with reputation enriched. Given the frenzied hype that surrounded the build-up to this fight, it perhaps failed to live up to all expect aces but it did at least confirm the American as one of the sport’s all-time greats. Finally, England’s cricketers have heading for defeat in the final test in Barbados. The West Indies need 25 runs with six wickets in hand to level the series. That’s your sport. Thank you very much. Back to the election now, and the leaders of Scotland’s four main political parties have clashed over spending cuts in the final televised debate before the vote on Thursday. In fiery exchanges at the event in Edinburgh, the SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon said she’d vote against a Labour budget if it imposed austerity on vulnerable people. james Cook was at the debate. In the place they call Scotland’s Sistine Chappell, the leaders were asked to give us peace. Audiences tell us that they really don’t like politicians talking over one another. Tough luck. This debate was ferocious, bad tempered, angry. There is a lot at stake.

We brought it back a week later and lo and behold we got it through. You canjust imagine the chaos, the absolute chaos if Nicola Sturgeon’s party hold the balance of power, what will the budget negotiations be like? I think we need stability, security, safety, honesty and decency in the next Parliament. And so the most extraordinary election campaign anyone in Scotland can remember is nearing its climax, not long now before we know whose prayers have been answered. Now, during the election campaign, we have been hearing from voters across the UK. Tonight, we are in Cheshire with Moira Cash whose son Fraser has cerebral palsy.

I had to at least give him three rounds out of the I2, but he was applying pressure but he wasn’t landing any punches. It was about the world had waited years to see, but the American took control immediately. Crowd favourite Pacquiao responded, the Filipino forcing his opponent backwards at times by Mayweather could always rely on his renowned defensive genius, using hisjab to great effect. Floyd Mayweather endorses his status as an all-time great. Afterwards, Pacquiao’s camp complained he’d been denied medical treatment for a shoulder injury that preevened him from using his right hand. Fishes saying the request came too late. I put up a good fight. I did my best and I think the people are very happy because even though I hurt my shoulder, I didn’t complain in the ring. Mayweather meanwhile confirmed he intended to fight one last time, refusing to say whether he’d consider a rematch. After boxing’s most lucrative bout, only Floyd Mayweather leaves here with reputation enriched. Given the frenzied hype that surrounded the build-up to this fight, it perhaps failed to live up to all expect aces but it did at least confirm the American as one of the sport’s all-time greats. Finally, England’s cricketers have heading for defeat in the final test in Barbados. The West Indies need 25 runs with six wickets in hand to level the series. That’s your sport. Thank you very much. Back to the election now, and the leaders of Scotland’s four main political parties have clashed over spending cuts in the final televised debate before the vote on Thursday. In fiery exchanges at the event in Edinburgh, the SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon said she’d vote against a Labour budget if it imposed austerity on vulnerable people. james Cook was at the debate. In the place they call Scotland’s Sistine Chappell, the leaders were asked to give us peace. Audiences tell us that they really don’t like politicians talking over one another. Tough luck. This debate was ferocious, bad tempered, angry. There is a lot at stake. I get quite angry in this debate that the other three people here seem to say we shouldn’t want to redues the benefits bill, we should want to leave people on benefits.

I have and quite rightly Fraser’s just mentioned that we now have a couple of carers, we sourced those ourselves. We have had people canvassing on the door that pretend to hear what you have to say, but as long as I agree to vote for them, that’s all they want to hear. Finding physiotherapists and occupational therapists and speech and language therapists is way down the list of priorities for the NHS. Itjust incenses me when you hear about all the bonuses of all the Chief Executives reduce the salaries a bit, that would provide more direct money to the services. Bullseye, bullseye. I’ve never had any help, certainly not from any MPs, and I probably don’t think they’d be interested quite honestly. That was Moira Cash from Cheshire with her views on the election. That is all from me. Now on BBC One, it’s time for the news where you are. Good night. Welcome to BBC London News. The Mayor Boris johnson says the Conservatives are the best party to tackle inequality providing the conditions to create more wealth. With just four days to voting, they still trail Labour in the polls in the capital, despite pushing their message of a recovering economy. The Mayor also denied cuts to housing benefits and other welfare This report from our Political Editor Tim Donovan. London’s Mayor says the promise of economic stability will bring voters back to the Tories and he rejects suggestions that welfare changes like the cut to Housing Benefit have been pushing poorer Londoners to the outskirts and that there hasn’t been enough affordable housing. In this mayoralty we’d have built more affordable homes than the previous mayoralty did. We are on target to build, notjust more homes, but a record number of homes. Half a millionjobs have been created in five years but food banks have also appeared. The Tory’s key policies are designed to appeal to middle earning Londoners. There’ll be no inheritance tax on estates worth up to £500,000. The 1+0% higher rate of income tax will kick in at £50,000, and the prosele for no income tax on the first £12,500 earnings is one that helps the better off most. Low income individuals don’t benefit from an income tax because their income is too low, partly because that’s always been true, partly because of a success of the coalition’s policy to increase the personal allowance to £10,000 a year. The group that benefits most are two earner couples, they can benefit twice from the personal allowance. The Mayor insists you don’t reduce inequality by constraining wealth creators. We want to have a dynamic economy because we think that that is how to pay for strong Public Services, so the two things are entirely indevisible and it’s only if you have a strong economy that you can put the money in people’s pockets that will enable them to change their lives. He rules out standing down as Mayor before the end of his term next May, but he doesn’t rule out either accepting a Cabinet post or pursuing the Tory leadership, whichever scenario may arise, if not next week, perhaps soon after. Police are investigating the death of a wealthy Middle Eastern man, found dead in his room at the Dorchester hotel. The Met says the death of the man in his 1+os remains unexplained, though it has not ruled out murder. Two men aged 31 and 50 and both from west London have been arrested. Police are searching for a three-year-old boy and his father who adopted him from his foster parents. He was last seen in Braintree yesterday morning. Essex Police say the man is not allowed unsupervised access to his child. A demonstration has been held in Brixton to show solidarity with the people of the US city, Baltimore, over the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray who died while in police custody. Protestors marched with banners to Windrush Square where they called forjustice for all those both in London and abroad who have died at the hands of the police. We are calling for the community to stand together, to say that enough is enough, we need to stop the police killings from happening. It’s frustrating. The first demonstration I went on I was ten years old, 20-odd years later we are still here protesting against police brutality. Here is a look at the Bank Holiday weather with Elizabeth Rizzini. The showers have largely faded away so it should stay dry for the rest of the night. A mild start tomorrow. There could be misty conditions and low cloud around.

On Wednesday, it looks like being a day of sunny spells with showers around before things settle down as we head towards the end of the working wee. Sunny spells and staying dry. That is it until tomorrow. From the weekend team, good night. Good evening. Gusty winds and intense downpours have been across the country today and there’s more to come this week. But not tomorrow. Bank Holiday weather much calmer, try with spells of sunshine for most. Untilwe try with spells of sunshine for most. Until we get there, some lively showers. They’ll spread back across Scotland. For most, the showers fade, the winds die down, temperatures in towns and cities could get to two or three. Rain across the far north of the mainland. The West Coast of Scotland, the west of Northern Ireland clouding over. For most, dry and bright with spells of sunshine. Feeling warmer than today in eastern and southern Scotland. Sunny spells and showers for Northern Ireland, chiefly in the west. Most of England and Wales dry and fine. Afternoon temperatures in the mid to high teens. It will cloud over a bit ",,

Thursday turned out to be a pretty decent day across the greater part of England and Wales simply because you were that much further away from all of this cloud, which made for a rather wet spell of weather certainly for northern and north—western parts of Scotland. As we embark on Friday, so we will drag that weather front a bit closer to the British Isles, just progressing down across Scotland and Northern Ireland in the first part of the day. Some sunshine in the mix and that will be the case across East Anglia and the south—east. As soon as you break away to the north or west, that is where you will find the cloud. Towards that front, the odd burst of rain coming into the western slopes of the Pennines. Generally speaking, cloud will begin to thin as that weather front gradually eases away out of Scotland and out of Northern Ireland and brighter skies follow behind. The consequence of shifting that weather front further south is to rob eventually East Anglia and parts of the south—east of that bright start. However, because of that bright start, temperatures will be around 20 degrees. Brighter skies behind, yes, but a fresherfeel to proceedings in the late afternoon and early evening. Saturday will be decent and on Sunday, rain moves from the north—west to the south—east. On Monday, the sunshine returns for many of us. Here’s the process. High pressure building for the beginning of the bank holiday weekend. That settles things very nicely indeed. Dry weather across eastern Scotland, the greater part of England and Wales. But there has to be a fly in the ointment. This weather system will come in later in the day around western Scotland and Northern Ireland, bringing bits and pieces of rain there. But conditions won’t be bad and temperatures will be in the teens for many of us. Fresher weather in the north with temperatures never better than 11 or 12. Some mild conditions still left over from that weather front. Then the rain will move in and temperatures will be pushed into the midteens. The wind will flick around to the north—west, so there will be a fresher feel for many of us on bank holiday Monday. Quite a lot of fine weather around and sunshine with variable cloud. As the temperatures reach the midteens, there may be enough in those clouds to bring one or two showers. For a bank holiday Monday, not too bad at all . The latest headlines from BBC News.

Record damages totalling more than a million have been awarded to eight people whose phones were hacked by the Mirror group of newspapers. The actress Sadie Frost and the former footballer Paul of torment. Her medical records, children’s lives, mental health, visits to Alcoholics Anonymous, all appeared in the Mirror. She thought that it was friends who were betraying her. When you lose trust in your friends and in your family, you know, you begin to, it is a very lonely place to be. These are record pay—outs, Paul Gascoigne was hacked for nine years, he is receiving more than £180,000. A Coronation Street actress more than £117,000, Sadie Frost, more than £260,000. And Lucy Benjamin of EastEnders, £157,000. For seven years the hacking took place, I’m just glad that it is all over. And for years Mirror Group denied that there was any evidence of hacking. What has emerged here is the fact that the Mirror was hacking phones on a daily basis, and it was notjust intercepting voice mail messages, it was accessing confidential details, medical records and this was going on for more than ten years. E—mails were written in code, the ""Muppets"" were the hackers, one journalist was making 60 to100 calls a day. What is uncertain is how many claims will now come. Scores certainly, possibly hundreds. This is a legal landmark. The question is, how far has the culture changed? Phone hacking is hopefully history, what is going to replace it? The competition is still there, journalists are still under severe pressure to go out and get that scoop and the question is, can they and will they all do it within the law? As the victims left, Mirror Group was pondering an appeal, it is thought that £12 million would cover the costs, that figure went up today by an extra 16 million, and criminal charges are also being considered.

Time now for all the sports news in Sport Today. Hello. This is Sport Today. I’m Chris Mitchell and we’re live from the BBC Sport Centre. Coming up for you: If you go, Figo — it’s a two—horse race for the FIFA presidency. Mirahel Van Praag and now Luis Figo pull out. Roots of recovery — he’s out for 98 but saves England’s blushes against New Zealand. Francesco Molinari leads the way after the first round at the PGA Championship in England. What a parting shot. Luis Figo says FFIA is a dictatorship under Sepp Blatter. Hello. This in Sport Today. The former Portuguese footballer has dropped out of the race to be the next FIFA President. He said he couldn’t be a part of what he called an election process designed for the delivery of absolute power to one man. Figo also said FIFA are living under a dictatorship’ while they hold court with Sepp Blatter, the current President. And he said the May 29 ballot is not a normal electoral act and he continued, saying he’s encountered hypocrisy among federation presidents and that people who wanted to speak out had been silenced. Just hours earlier, Dutch candidate Michael van Praag withdrew as a candidate for the top job. He has switched his support to Prince Ali, who will now be the sole man to try and stop Blatter from extending his 17—year reign at the top. TRANSLATION: This campaign was always about a need to bring always about a need to bring football forward and improve FIFA football forward and improve FIFA and it still is.

The Volkswagen of Andreas Mikkelsen was quickest on the first day of the Rally de Portugal. In a specially devised stage where two cars race head—to—head, Mikkelsen clocked a best time ofjust over three minutes for the three—mile test.

Alberto Contador retains the leader’s jersey after the 12th stage of the Giro D’Italia. It was run in very wet and difficult conditions, which caught a few riders out, causing a few alarms for competitors and spectators alike — these fans getting a close up of Alexandre Gerniez. Belgian Phillipe Gilbert won the 190 kilometre stage from Imola to Monte Berico, finishing three seconds clear of the field which was headed by Contador. The Spaniard now leads by 17 seconds and is aiming to be the first rider since 1998 to win both the Giro and the Tour de France in one season.

Thursday turned out to be a pretty decent day across the greater part of England and Wales simply because you were that much further away from all of this cloud, which made for a rather wet spell of weather certainly for northern and north—western parts of Scotland. As we embark on Friday, so we will drag that weather front a bit closer to the British Isles, moistening things up in England and Wales, just progressing down across Scotland and Northern Ireland in the first part of the day. Some sunshine in the mix and that will be the case across East Anglia and the south—east. As soon as you break away to the north or west, that is where you run into much more cloud. Towards that front, the odd burst of rain coming into the western slopes of the Pennines. Generally speaking, cloud will begin to thin as that weather front gradually eases away out of Scotland and out of Northern Ireland and brighter skies follow behind. The consequence of shifting that weather front further south is to rob eventually East Anglia and parts of the south—east of that bright start. We may find some rain but because of that bright start, temperatures will be around 20 degrees. Brighter skies behind, yes, but a fresher feel to proceedings in the late afternoon and early evening. Saturday will be decent and on Sunday, rain moves from the north—west to the south—east. On Monday, the sunshine returns for many of us. Here’s the process. We start to build in the area of high pressure building for the beginning of the bank holiday weekend. That settles things very nicely indeed. Dry weather across eastern Scotland, the greater part of England and Wales. But there has to be a fly in the ointment. This weather system will come in later in the day around western Scotland and Northern Ireland, bringing bits and pieces of rain there. But conditions won’t be bad and temperatures will be in the teens for many of us. That weather front introduces fresher weather in the north with temperatures never better than 11 or 12. Some mild conditions still left over from that weather front. Then the rain will move in and temperatures will be pushed well on into the teens. The wind will flick around to the north—west, so there will be a fresher feel for many of us on bank holiday Monday. Quite a lot of fine weather around and sunshine with variable cloud. As the temperatures reach the midteens, there may be enough in those clouds to bring one or two showers. For a bank holiday Monday, not too bad at all. Welcome to BBC News, broadcasting to viewers on public television in the US and around the globe. Our top stories: The White House says Islamic State victories in Palmyra and Ramadi in the past week are a tactical setback. A grand jury in the United States charges six Baltimore police officers relating to the death of a black man in police custody. As our Why Australia is taking to the stage and competing in this years’ Eurovision song contest. President Obama has insisted the United States is not losing the war against the jihadists who call themselves Islamic State. With the extremists seizing control of Palmyra in Syria and Ramadi in Iraq, in just the past few days, the president has admitted there have been setbacks, but he’s promised more help for Iraqi forces. More reaction from Washington in a moment. First, this from our world affairs editor, John Simpson. With this latest success, capturing notjust the historic city of Palmyra but the important Al—Hail gasfield outside it, the self—styled Islamic State now controls 50% of Syria’s territory. The sheer savagery of IS has worked superbly well. It paralyses its enemies with terror. ""We are coming for you,"" he says, with disturbing calm. ""With men who love death as much as you love life, you will never be safe as long as we are alive."" Palmyra, one of the world’s great classical cities, is now defenceless. when it ran, Islamic State destroys all vestiges of the non—Islamic past. The speed of the IS advance has been quite extraordinary. Yesterday it was Palmyra. Four days ago, it gained the important town of Ramadi in Western Iraq. A vast flood of terrified refugees pours along the roads out of Ramadi. Desperate to escape the vengeance of Islamic State. A mere 200 IS fighters captured the town, chasing out ten times that number of Iraqi soldiers. The people of the town feel utberty abandoned. This woman screams at the BBC... ""The government has let us down."" All that is only 60 miles away. Yet Baghdad feels calm and pretty relaxed tonight. Almost two thirds of the Iraqi army is based in and around the capital to protect it. The fall of Ramadi has given people a scare here, though the anxiety has started to fade now. But there is a definite feeling that the Iraqi army let the country down. While in America, some people are starting to blame it all on US policy. And yet Western officials here are confident that IS can and will be beaten. They believe Ramadi will be recaptured within weeks. the latest developments in Syria. Palmyra is a UNESCO World Heritage site. It is home to historic ruins and other artefacts. They are, ironically enough, critical to our understanding of this culture and the history of the Iraqi and Syrian people. ISIS’s utter disregard and lack of respect for that heritage is consistent with the kind of ideology that is propagated by an extremist organisation.

Myanmar has softened its stance on the migrant crisis in the Andaman Sea following strong diplomatic pressure from across the region. It’s agreed to take part in an emergency meeting next week the plight of thousands of boat people will be discussed. Many of the stranded migrants are Rohinghya Muslims fleeing persecution in Myanmar, where they are not recognised as citizens. Both Malaysia and Indonesia announced on Wednesday that they will offer temporary shelter to all incoming.

Anis Sardar built bombs as part of a campaign to kill Americans fighting in the country. Daniel Sandford reports. From black rah driver to Belmarsh Prison. Today Anis Sardar became the first man to be found guilty by a British court of murdering a US soldier in Iraq. It was during the so-ralled surge in 2007... When US soldiers were trying to help the new government in Baghdad deal with Al Qaeda in Iraq and found themselves as targets. The bomb which blow a hola through the bottom of this armoured vehicle killed Sergeant first class RandyJohnson. It was made by Anis Sardar. But amazingly, the Americans stored every bomb they found in Iraq and Afghanistan in this warehouse in Virginia and poured over them for fingerprints. Anis Sardar’s prints were found onto devices linked to the bomb that killed SergeantJohnson. He was tracked to Wembley and today a south Londonjury convicted him. Anis Sardar has reinvented him self as a black cab driver in the last few years, but in reality he’s a bomb maker, a terrorist, and this conviction today says he is also guilty of murder. Within months of returning from Syria and his bomb—making exploits in Iraq, Anis Sardar was here at Feltham young offenders institution in west London. But not as an inmate, he was working with the Muslim chaplain teaching young offenders. Records show he was invited through the prison gates three times over the next four years. Scotland Yard said Anis Sardar’s conviction showed they will pursue anyone for terrorist acts committed anywhere in the world no matter how long afterwards. He will be sentenced tomorrow.

Top Gear is one of the BBC’s most popular programmes, with millions of viewers around the world. But earlier this year, the main presenter of the show was forced to leave after a bust—up with one of his producers. Now, Jeremy Clarkson has admitted it was his own fault and that leaving the programme has left ‘a big hole’ in his life. Colin Patterson has more. Jeremy Clarkson back at the BBC for his first interview since he was told two months ago that his Top Gear career was over. He told Chris Evans that he was still coming to terms with losing his job for an unprovoked physical and verbal attack on one of Top Gear’s producers. It was my own silly fault, so I can hardly complain. And what are you saddest about if it is all comparable? Having to leave Top Gear or having to stop working for the BBC? Equal, actually. I do like the BBC. There are some dreadful people in it but there are also some really talented people. Tomorrow, jeremy Clarkson will be reunited for Richard Hamilton and James May for the start of the Top Gear Live tour but it could be months before any television projects are announced. It was very sudden. You don’tjustjump into something. You have to have a look at what is out there. Before he went off in his Ferrari, Jeremy Clarkson said he was not mling out a return to the BBC, as although his contract was not renewed, he was never actually sacked. This Saturday, millions will tune in for the final of the Eurovision song contest, the quest to find Europe’s best new song. But this year there’s one very big difference — a wild card entry from the other side of the world. For the first time Australia is competing. And the country’s pulling out all the stops, sending one of its favourite artists, Guy Sebastian. We’ve been following Australia’s Eurovision fans as they make their way to the annual competition. It’s 6:303m on Friday the 13th of May and we are about to leave the house for the trip of a lifetime. 31 hours later and we made it! Welcome to the Eurovision Song Contest 2015. Go Australia! Australia! Woooo! Someone had tears in their eyes when they found out that Australia would be joining the contest. It was very surprising. It was completely unexpected. We hadn’t seen this coming at all but we were really proud in that moment. I didn’t know what to expect. I had seen it from Australia but actually be here and absorb the culture and all of the excitement around the event is really mind—blowing. I can’t wait for Saturday. I think it’s bonkers. I’m very welcoming for Australia but... If it is a guest spot, that would be one thing. But I think they will be here forever. I think people would be less upset if they actually had to qualify. Are you ready to see Guy Sebastian? CHEERING AND APPLAUSE. SINGING. We’ll be, like, crazy! Thank you, Europe! CHEERING AND APPLAUSE.

Thursday turned out to be a pretty decent day across the greater part of England and Wales simply because you were that much further away from all of this cloud, which made for a rather wet spell of weather certainly for northern and north—western parts of Scotland. As we embark on Friday, so we will drag that weather front a bit closer to the British Isles, moistening things up in England and Wales, just progressing down across Scotland and Northern Ireland in the first part of the day. Some sunshine in the mix and that will be the case across East Anglia and the south—east. As soon as you break away to the north or west, that is where you run into much more cloud. Towards that front, the odd burst of rain coming into the western slopes of the Pennines. Generally speaking, cloud will begin to thin as that weather front gradually eases away out of Scotland and out of Northern Ireland and brighter skies follow behind. The consequence of shifting that weather front further south is to rob eventually East Anglia and parts of the south—east of that bright start. We may find some rain but because of that bright start, temperatures will be around 20 degrees. Brighter skies behind, yes, but a fresher feel to proceedings in the late afternoon and early evening. Saturday will be decent and on Sunday, rain moves from the north—west to the south—east. Come Monday, the sunshine returns for many of us. Here’s the process. We start to build in the area of high pressure for the beginning of the bank holiday weekend. That settles things very nicely indeed. Dry weather across eastern Scotland, the greater part of England and Wales. But there has to be a fly in the ointment. This weather system will come in later in the day around western Scotland and Northern Ireland, bringing bits and pieces of rain there. But conditions won’t be bad and temperatures will be in the teens for many of us. That weather front introduces fresher weather in the north with temperatures never better than 11 or 12. Some mild conditions still left over from that weather front. Then the rain will move in and temperatures will be pushed well on into the teens. The wind will flick around to the north—west, so there will be a fresher feel for many of us on bank holiday Monday. Quite a lot of fine weather around and sunshine with variable cloud. As the temperatures reach the midteens, there may be enough in those clouds to bring one or two showers. For a bank holiday Monday, not too bad at all. President Obama has described the loss of the Iraqi city of Ramadi and the Syrian city of Palmyra to the militant group, Islamic State, as a ""tactical setback"". He said he did not think the US and Iraqi governments were losing the fight against the jihadists and promised more help for the security forces.

Now on BBC News all the latest business news live from Singapore. Japan’s central bank weighs in with its assessment of the economy as it sees its fastest growth in air. And meet the South Korean woman who earns $500,000 per year teaching English. Welcome to this Friday edition of Asia Business Report. The Bank of japan could be set to upgrade its assessment of the economy for the first time in almost two years. The economy grew at 2.A% in the first quarter, much stronger than expected. Analysts are widely expecting no change to the pace of current monetary easing. There have been strong expectations that the Bank ofJapan will have to do more. The economy is growing stronger than expected. That helps tremendously. Much of the growth is coming from overseas. Also, companies have become more optimistic and are willing to increase their inventories. The Bank ofJapan will be saying, these inventories have to be sold, how will companies be able to do that when consumption is still comparatively low and the economy is not growing even stronger. So for the long term, do you think the stimulus will continue? We are also seeing low oil prices pick up from the rest of the world. Are we expecting to see the stimulus in place for the rest of the year? The stimulus will still be in place. But there might be an additional boost necessary. The economy has recovered, but it will probably slow down. When things are getting into more normal territory during the summer, the Bank ofJapan will probably have to double up and do something more so companies can sell their inventories and start to invest and the overall outlook becomes more sustainable. How much longer can the Bank ofJapan and Japan overall continue to do this? It is one of the most indebted countries in terms of public debt in the developed world. It does appear as if Abenomics has overreached. The Bank ofjapan will not start to taper for at least another two years. This is working because all of the debt is internal. The money is being taken out a private pockets where people are unwilling to spend and is now in business pockets. The problem is companies need to be optimistic as well. They need to focus on exports, selling products globally. They need to start to invest and that requires even more optimism.

This is essential preparation for the classroom. She gets $500,000 per year teaching English to students who pay for their lessons. They expect her to look smart. My income is around $500,000.

The top stories this hour: The US has admitted setbacks in the fight against Islamic State militants in Palmyra in Syria and Ramadi in Iraq, but said it didn’t mean the war was being lost. After growing diplomatic pressure, the authorities in Myanmar say they’ll attend next week’s emergency meeting in Thailand to tackle the region’s migrant crisis. Record damages totalling more than a million have been awarded to eight people whose phones were hacked by the Mirror group of newspapers. The actress Sadie Frost and the former footballer Paul Gascoigne were among the celebrities set to receive six—figure sums after their voicemails were routinely listened to byjournalists over a number of years. David Sillito was in court. Sadie Frost arrived in court today, forjudgement on five years of torment. Her medical records, children’s lives, mental health, visits to Alcoholics Anonymous, all appeared in the Mirror. She thought that it was friends who were betraying her. When you lose trust in your friends and in your family, you know, you begin to, it is a very lonely place to be. And Lucy Benjamin of EastEnders, £157,000. For seven years the hacking took place, I’m just glad that it is all over. And for years Mirror Group denied that there was any evidence of hacking. What has emerged here is the fact that the Mirror was hacking phones on a daily basis, and it was notjust intercepting voice mail messages, it was accessing confidential details, medical records and this was going on for more than ten years. E—mails were written in code, the ""Muppets"" were the hackers, one journalist was making 60 to100 calls a day. What is uncertain is how many claims will now come. Scores certainly, possibly hundreds. This is a legal landmark. The question is, how far has the culture changed? Phone hacking is hopefully history, what is going to replace it? The competition is still there, journalists are still under severe pressure to go out and get that scoop and the question is, can they and will they all do it within the law? As the victims left, Mirror Group was pondering an appeal, it is thought that £12 million would cover the costs, that figure went up today by an extra 16 million, and criminal charges are also being considered.

Roots of recovery — he’s out for 98 but saves England’s blushes against New Zealand. Francesco Molinari leads the way after the first round at the PGA Championship in England. What a parting shot. Luis Figo says FIFA is a dictatorship under Sepp Blatter. Hello, this is Sport Today. The Former Portuguese football he dropped out of the race to be the next FIFA President. He said he couldn’t be a part of what he called an election process designed ""for the delivery of absolute power to one man."" Figo also said FIFA are ""living under a dictatorship"" while they hold court with Sepp Blatter, the current president. And he said the May 29 ballot is ""not a normal electoral act."" He continued, saying he’s encountered hypocrisy among federation presidents, saying people who wanted to speak out had been silenced. Just hours earlier, Dutch candidate Michael van Praag withdrew as a candidate for the top job. He’s switched his support to Prince Ali, who will now be the sole man to try and stop Blatter from from extending his 17—year reign at the top. TRANSLATION: This campaign was always about a need to bring football forward and improve FIFA and it still is. This is why the three of us sat down to discuss our chances. We also concluded that we believe that one single candidate will have a better chance to win the election. Prince Ali convincingly demonstrated that at this moment in time he is the candidate who has the biggest chance to challenge Sepp Blatter. The BBC has learned that Napoli coach Rafael Benitez is a leading contender to become the new man in charge of Real Madrid.

Joe Root and Ben Stokes narrowly missed out on centuries in their recovery mission to pull England out of trouble against New Zealand in the first cricket test. The Black Caps dominated the morning session reducing England to 30 for four. Root was out just two runs short of a ton while Stokes was bowled for 92. At the close England were 354 for seven. jos Butuer out to the last ball of the day. Joe Wilson reports. New Zealand’s cricketers are here to take the most of opportunities. A team fragile in confidence could easily implode from there. They finished the day passed 350 with seven wickets down. It is one thing for England to talk about moving forward, playing positive cricket, but it is another thing to do it. With Ben Stokes and Joe Root, that is exactly how they responded. Stokes knows that the best form of defence is a good attack. The sad thing for them is that they both fell short of their personal century. Used to playing Twenty20 cricket, the New Zealand bowlers tired visibly during a Test match day. England can certainly point to a day of genuine progress.

Shahid Afridi says he’s honoured to be playing international cricket in Pakistan again. They take on Zimbabwe on Friday. If you’re affected by flash photography please look away for the next 30 seconds... The two Twenty 20’s and three one day games between the two nations are the first internationals on home soil for Pakistan, since 2009. Afridi and his opposite number, Elton Chigumbura showed off the trophy they’ll be playing for.

In a specially devised stage where two cars race head—to—head Mikkelsen, clocked a best time ofjust over three minutes for the three mile test. That was faster than his Volkswagen teammates Sebastien Ogier and Jeri—Matti Latvala who came in second and third. Mads Ostberg and his co—driver had a lucky escape after rolling his Citroen across the track. He managed to get the car back on its wheels to end the Shakedown stage in twelfth position.

It was run in very wet and difficult conditions, which caught a few riders out, causing a few alarms for competitors and spectators alike. These fans getting a close up of Alexandre Gerniez. Belgian Phillipe Gilbert won the 190 kilometre stage from Imola to Monte Berico, finishing three seconds clear of the field which was headed by Contador. The Spaniard now leads by 17 seconds and is aiming to be the first rider since 1998 to win both the Giro and the Tour de France in one season.

All of the latest sports news All of the latest sports news available on the website. available on the website. For now, I am out here! Thursday turned out to be a pretty decent day across the greater part of England and Wales simply because you were that much further away from all of this cloud, which made for a rather wet spell of weather certainly for northern and north—western parts of Scotland. As we embark on Friday, so we will drag that weather front a bit closer to the British Isles, moistening things up in England and Wales, just progressing down across Scotland and Northern Ireland in the first part of the day. Some sunshine in the mix and that will be the case across East Anglia and the south—east. As soon as you break away to the north or west, that is where you run into much more cloud. Towards that front, the odd burst of rain coming into the western slopes of the Pennines. Generally speaking, cloud will begin to thin as that weather front gradually eases away out of Scotland and out of Northern Ireland and brighter skies follow behind. The consequence of shifting that weather front further south is to rob eventually East Anglia and parts of the south—east of that bright start. We may find some rain but because of that bright start, temperatures will be around 20 degrees. Brighter skies behind, yes, but a fresher feel to proceedings in the late afternoon and early evening. Saturday will be decent and on Sunday, rain moves from the north—west to the south—east. Come Monday, the sunshine returns for many of us. Here’s the process. We start to build in the area of high pressure for the beginning of the bank holiday weekend. That settles things very nicely indeed. Dry weather across eastern Scotland, the greater part of England and Wales. But there has to be a fly in the ointment. This weather system will come in later in the day around western Scotland and Northern Ireland, bringing bits and pieces of rain there. But conditions won’t be bad and temperatures will be in the teens for many of us. That weather front introduces fresher weather in the north with temperatures never better than 11 or 12. Some mild conditions still left over from that weather front. Then the rain will move in and temperatures will be pushed well on into the teens. The wind will flick around to the north—west, so there will be a fresher feel for many of us on bank holiday Monday. Quite a lot of fine weather around and sunshine with variable cloud. As the temperatures reach the midteens, there may be enough in those clouds to bring one or two showers. For a bank holiday Monday, not too bad at all. Welcome to BBC News, broadcasting to viewers on public television in the US and around the globe. Our top stories: The White House says Islamic State victories in Palmyra and Ramadi in the past week are a tactical setback. Anis Sardar, a taxi driverfrom London, has been found guilty of the murder of a US soldier in Iraq in a roadside bombing, eight years ago. As our investigation has continued, additional information has been A grand jury in the United States charges six Baltimore police officers relating to the death of a black man in police custody. As our investigation has continued, additional information has been discovered and as is often the case, during an ongoing investigation, pay almost $2 million in damages to eight phone hacking victims. President Obama has insisted the United States is not losing the war against the jihadists who call themselves Islamic State. With the extremists seizing control of Palmyra in Syria and Ramadi in Iraq, in just the past few days, the president has admitted there have been setbacks, but he’s promised more help for Iraqi forces. More reaction from Washington in a moment. First, this from our world affairs editor, John Simpson. With this latest success, capturing notjust the historic city of Palmyra but the important Al—Hail gasfield outside it, the self—styled Islamic State now controls 50% of Syria’s territory. The sheer savagery of IS has worked superbly well. It paralyses its enemies with terror. ""We are coming for you,"" he says, with disturbing calm. ""With men who love death as much as you love life, you will never be safe as long as we are alive."" Palmyra, one of the world’s great classical cities, is now defenceless. when it ran, Islamic State destroys all vestiges of the non—Islamic past. The speed of the IS advance has been quite extraordinary. Yesterday it was Palmyra. Four days ago, it gained the important town of Ramadi in Western Iraq. A vast flood of terrified refugees pours along the roads out of Ramadi. Desperate to escape the vengeance of Islamic State. A mere 200 IS fighters captured the town, chasing out ten times that number of Iraqi soldiers. The people of the town feel utberty abandoned. This woman screams at the BBC... ""The government has let us down."" All that is only 60 miles away. Yet Baghdad feels calm and pretty relaxed tonight. Almost two thirds of the Iraqi army is based in and around the capital to protect it. The fall of Ramadi has given people a scare here, though the anxiety has started to fade now. But there is a definite feeling that the Iraqi army let the country down. While in America, some people are starting to blame it all on US policy. And yet Western officials here are confident that IS can and will be beaten. They believe Ramadi will be recaptured within weeks. Even so, the last few days have been a nasty shock. Aaron Miller is Vice—President for New Initiatives at the Wilson centre. Good to talk to you again. How has led Islamic State on this and what lad Islamic State on this and what you think it is led Islamic State on this and what you think it is planning the next? you think it is planning the next?

Always a pleasure, love the BBC. Staying in the region, and the Pentagon has admitted for the first time that its air strikes against Islamic State From Washington, Gary O’Donoghue has more. In what has been called a landmark prosecution, a taxi driverfrom London has been found guilty of the murder of a US soldier in Iraq in a roadside bombing, eight years ago. Anis Sardar built bombs as part of a campaign to kill Americans fighting in the country. Daniel Sandford reports. From black rah driver to Belmarsh Prison. It was during the so-ralled surge in 2007... When US soldiers were trying to help the new government in Baghdad deal with Al Qaeda in Iraq and found themselves as targets. The bomb which blow a hola through the bottom of this armoured vehicle killed Sergeant first class RandyJohnson. It was made by Anis Sardar. But amazingly, the Americans stored every bomb they found in Iraq and Afghanistan in this warehouse in Virginia and pored over them for fingerprints. Anis Sardar’s prints were found onto devices linked to the bomb that killed SergeantJohnson. He was tracked to Wembley and today a south Londonjury convicted him. Anis Sardar has reinvented him self as a black cab driver in the last few years, but in reality he’s a bomb maker, a terrorist, and this conviction today says he is also guilty of murder. Within months of returning from Syria and his bomb—making exploits in Iraq, Anis Sardar was here at Feltham young offenders institution in west London. But not as an inmate, he was working with the Muslim chaplain teaching young offenders. Records show he was invited through the prison gates three times over the next four years. Scotland Yard said Anis Sardar’s conviction showed they will pursue anyone for terrorist acts committed anywhere in the world no matter how long afterwards. He will be sentenced tomorrow. Some news in brief now: The head of the Boy Scouts of America has described the ban on openly gay adult volunteers as unsustainable. Robert Gates, who was previously US Defence Secretary, has told the Scouts’ AGM the policy won’t be changed, but he did raise the possibility of the ban being lifted soon. There are no plans, he said, to revoke the charters of local Scout Councils who intend to ignore the ban. Voters in remote areas of Ireland are amongst the first to vote in a referendum on whether to legalise same—sex marriage. 21 countries around the world have legalised gay marriage, but Ireland would be the first to do so through a popular vote. Results are expected on Saturday. Two of the four candidates standing for election as president of football’s world governing body, FIFA, have dropped out of the race. The Portuguese former football star Luis Figo and the president of the Dutch Football Association, Michael van Praag, have withdrawn. The only remaining challenger to Sepp Blatter is Jordan’s Prince Ali Al Hussein. In the United States, a grand jury in the city of Baltimore has indicted all six of the police officers charged in connection with the death of Freddie Gray, the man whose death in custody in April sparked protests and riots over police violence towards black men. The six officers are expected to appear in court inJuly. As I previously indicated, my office conducted an independent investigation into the circumstances surrounding the tragic incident with the death of Freddie Gray. Our investigation revealed that we had sufficient probable cause to bring charges against six police officers. As the investigation has continued additional information has been discovered and as is often the case during an ongoing investigation, it should be decided based upon the evidence. During the past few weeks my team has been presenting evidence to a grand jury that just today returned indictments against all six officers. Record damages totalling nearly $2 million have been awarded to eight people whose phones were hacked by the Mirror group of newspapers. The actress Sadie Frost and the former footballer Paul Gascoigne were among the celebrities set to receive six—figure sums after their voicemails were routinely listened to byjournalists over a number of years. David Sillito was in court. Sadie Frost arrived in court today, forjudgement on five years of torment. Her medical records, children’s lives, mental health, visits to Alcoholics Anonymous, all appeared in the Mirror. She thought that it was friends who were betraying her. When you lose trust in your friends and in your family, you know, you begin to, it is a very lonely place to be. These are record pay—outs, Paul Gascoigne was hacked for nine years, he is receiving more than £180,000. A Coronation Street actress more than £117,000, Sadie Frost, more than £260,000. And Lucy Benjamin of EastEnders, £157,000. For seven years the hacking took place, I’m just glad that it is all over. And for years Mirror Group denied that there was any evidence of hacking. What has emerged here is the fact that the Mirror was hacking phones on a daily basis, and it was notjust intercepting voice mail messages, it medical records and this was going on for more than ten years. E—mails were written in code, the ""Muppets"" were the hackers, one journalist was making 60 to100 calls a day. What is uncertain is how many claims will now come. Scores certainly, possibly hundreds. This is a legal landmark. The question is, how far has the culture changed? and the question is, can they and will they all do it within the law? As the victims left, Mirror Group was pondering an appeal, it is thought that £12 million would cover the costs, that figure went up today by an extra 16 million, and criminal charges are also being considered. Stay with us on BBC News, still to come: Bonkers or brilliant? Why Australia is taking to the stage and competing in this years Eurovision song contest. First let’s round up the stories making headlines in the newspapers around the world. Starting with the International New York Times, it says Islamic State’s recent takeover of the city of Palmyra in Syria means it now controls about half the country. David Cameron’s European challenge leads the Times. The British Prime Minister will make a pitch to EU leaders in Latvia today, before going on a tour around the continent, to gather support for reforming the UK’s place in Europe. The Financial Times US edition reports Saudi Arabia, the kingdom built on oil wealth, foresees a fossil fuel phase—out by around 2050. The South China Morning Post has an exclusive on China’s Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank. The German envoy to Beijing says Germany will have a director on the board. And finally, the Wall StreetJournal European edition focuses on the bird flu outbreak gripping the United States. The government has set aside AOO—million dollars to help compensate farmers for almost 38 million culled birds and disease testing. This is BBC News. My name’s Mike Embley. The latest headlines: The US has admitted setbacks in the fight against Islamic State militants in Palmyra in Syria and Ramadi in Iraq, but said it didn’t mean the war was being lost. Anis Sardar, a taxi driverfrom London, has been found guilty of the murder of a US soldier in Iraq in a roadside bombing, eight years ago.

But earlier this year, the main presenter of the show was forced to leave after a bust—up with one of his producers. Now, Jeremy Clarkson has admitted it was his own fault and that leaving the programme has left ‘a big hole’ in his life. Colin Patterson has more. Jeremy Clarkson, back at the BBC for his first interview since he was told two months ago that his Top Gear career was over. Let’s welcome to the radio two breakfast show Let’s welcome to the radio two breakfast showJeremy Clarkson. Good breakfast show jeremy Clarkson. Good morning, breakfast showJeremy Clarkson. Good morning, Jeremy! Good morning Chris, morning, jeremy! Good morning Chris, how are you? He told Chris Evans that he was still coming to terms with losing his job for an unprovoked physical and verbal attack on one of Top Gear’s producers. It was my own silly fault, so I can hardly complain. And what are you saddest about if it is all comparable? Having to leave Top Gear or having to stop working for the BBC? Equal, actually. I do like the BBC. There are some dreadful people in it but there are also some really talented people. 1m Now bring it back, ready? Look at this! Tomorrow, jeremy Clarkson will be reunited with Richard Hamilton and James May for the start of the Top Gear Live tour but it could be months before any television projects are announced. It was very sudden. You don’tjustjump into something. You have to have a look at what is out there. Before he went off in his Ferrari, Jeremy Clarkson said he was not mling out a return to the BBC, as although his contract was not renewed, he was never actually sacked. This Saturday — millions will tune in for the final of the Eurovision song contest — the quest to find Europe’s best new song. But this year there’s one very big difference — a wild card entry from the other side of the world. For the first time Australia is competing. We’ve been following Australia’s Eurovision fans as they make their way to the annual competition. It’s 6:303m on Friday the 13th of May and we are about to leave the house for the trip of a lifetime. 31 hours later and we made it! Welcome to the Eurovision Song Contest 2015. Go Australia! Australia! Woooo! Someone had tears in their eyes when they found out that Australia would be joining the contest. It was very surprising. It was completely unexpected. We hadn’t seen this coming at all but we were really proud in that moment. I didn’t know what to expect. I had seen it from Australia but actually be here and absorb the culture and all of the excitement around the event is really mind—blowing. I can’t wait for Saturday. I think it’s bonkers. I’m very welcoming for Australia but... If it is a guest spot, that would be one thing. But I think they will be here forever. I think people would be less upset if they actually had to qualify. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE. SINGING. I think if we win the competition, it would be an interesting situation for all of the Eurovision fans. I don’t think they will know how to take it. We’ll be over the moon. We’ll be, like, crazy! Thank you, Europe! CHEERING AND APPLAUSE. Try to contain yourself out there! That is all, thank you for watching. Thursday turned out to be a pretty decent day across the greater part of England and Wales simply because you were that much further away from all of this cloud, which made for a rather wet spell of weather certainly for northern and north—western parts of Scotland. As we embark on Friday, so we will drag that weather front a bit closer to the British Isles, moistening things up in England and Wales, just progressing down across Scotland and Northern Ireland in the first part of the day. Some sunshine in the mix and that will be the case across East Anglia and the south—east. As soon as you break away to the north or west, that is where you run into much more cloud. Towards that front, the odd burst of rain coming into the western slopes of the Pennines. Generally speaking, cloud will begin to thin as that weather front gradually eases away out of Scotland and out of Northern Ireland and brighter skies follow behind. The consequence of shifting that weather front further south is to rob eventually East Anglia and parts of the south—east of that bright start. We may find some rain but because of that bright start, temperatures will be around 20 degrees. Brighter skies behind, yes, but a fresher feel to proceedings in the late afternoon and early evening. Saturday will be decent and on Sunday, rain moves from the north—west to the south—east. Come Monday, the sunshine returns for many of us. Here’s the process. We start to build in the area of high pressure for the beginning of the bank holiday weekend. That settles things very nicely indeed. Dry weather across eastern Scotland, the greater part of England and Wales. But there has to be a fly in the ointment. This weather system will come in later in the day around western Scotland and Northern Ireland, bringing bits and pieces of rain there. But conditions won’t be bad and temperatures will be in the teens for many of us. That weather front introduces fresher weather in the north with temperatures never better than 11 or 12. Some mild conditions still left over from that weather front. Then the rain will move in and temperatures will be pushed well on into the teens. The wind will flick around to the north—west, so there will be a fresher feel for many of us on bank holiday Monday. Quite a lot of fine weather around and sunshine with variable cloud. As the temperatures reach the midteens, there may be enough in those clouds to bring one or two showers. For a bank holiday Monday, not too bad at all. The latest headlines from BBC News. My name’s Mike Embley. President Obama has described the loss of the Iraqi city of Ramadi and the Syrian city of Palmyra to the militant group, Islamic State, as a tactical setback. He said he did not think the US and Iraqi governments were losing the fight against the jihadists and promised more help for the security forces. A taxi driverfrom London has been found guilty of the murder of a US soldier in Iraq in a roadside bombing eight years ago. Anis Sardar built bombs as part of a campaign to kill Americans fighting in the country. It is being describes as a landmark prosecution.

Now on BBC News all the latest business news live from Singapore. Japan’s central bank weighs in with its assessment of the economy as it sees its fastest growth in air. And meet the South Korean woman who earns $500,000 per year teaching English. Welcome to this Friday edition of Asia Business Report. The Bank of japan could be set to upgrade its assessment of the economy for the first time in almost two years. The economy grew at 2.A% in the first quarter, much stronger than expected. Analysts are widely expecting no change to the pace of current monetary easing. There have been strong expectations that the Bank ofJapan will have to do more. The economy is growing stronger than expected. That helps tremendously. Much of the growth is coming from overseas. Also, companies have become more optimistic and are willing to increase their inventories. The Bank ofJapan will be saying, these inventories have to be sold, how will companies be able to do that when consumption is still comparatively low and the economy is not growing even stronger. So for the long term, do you think the stimulus will continue? We are also seeing low oil prices pick up from the rest of the world. Are we expecting to see the stimulus in place for the rest of the year? The stimulus will still be in place. But there might be an additional boost necessary. The economy has recovered, but it will probably slow down. When things are getting into more normal territory during the summer, the Bank ofJapan will probably have to double up and do something more so companies can sell their inventories and start to invest and the overall outlook becomes more sustainable. How much longer can the Bank ofJapan and Japan overall continue to do this? It is one of the most indebted countries in terms of public debt in the developed world. It does appear as if Abenomics has overreached. The Bank ofjapan will not start to taper for at least another two years. This is working because all of the debt is internal. The money is being taken out a private pockets where people are unwilling to spend and is now in business pockets. The problem is companies need to be optimistic as well. They need to focus on exports, selling products globally. They need to start to invest and that requires even more optimism. In other news, hundreds of union workers have staged a protest outside Cathay Pacific Airways headquarters in Hong Kong. It follows claims the management had failed to negotiate a deal of pay and benefits. A strike by cabin crew is planned for August. Hewlett—Packard is selling a 51% stake in its Chinese business for $2.3 billion. It will create a new business worth $4.5 billion. The new firm will have about 8000 workers, more than $3 billion in annual revenue. A top executive from Ford Motors says most of the company’s sale growth will come from the Asia—Pacific region despite a slowdown in China. Their sales in the first quarter made up hearty 7% of the company’s total. A high—profile launch for a high—profile programme. The Prime Minister has unveiled Make in India last year, and the idea is simple. Encourage companies to manufacture across the country, creating jobs and increasing exports. From cars to phones to chocolate, some of the biggest international names in manufacturing have shown a flurry of enthusiasm about India, announcing plans to set up factories or expand existing production. One of them is German carmaker BMW. It has this factory in Chennai and has also increased investments in India by almost 25% in the past year. India is more and more on the map forward decisions, looking not only for the Germans and Indian market, because now things that we are making will come on the market in six or seven years. The Indian luxury car market is for five times the size of what we have today. Make in India has grabbed the attention of product producers, but that is only part of the story. Indian producers are at the heart of the project and many believe it can’t succeed until small and medium—sized manufacturers like this one get incentives to pick up any fracturing. Is this really changing for them? Not yet, says the manager of this format makes industrial and duties on raw materials there are much lower than in India. The man who runs the factory says that apart from cutting duties, they need a separate policy for small manufacturers to make them competitive. There is investment in land and building. In China, they can operate their business almost for free. The government believes it will work in the long mn, but before attracting more investors and providing incentives for small businesses, very much needs to be fixed.

When it comes to education, in South Korea demand is so strong that it accounts for 12% of all consumer spending. Parents push their children relentlessly, with classes in evenings and weekends. It has led to some teachers earning very high salaries, particularly to teach English. We met one of them. 7:30am, the start of the working day. For Gwen Lee’sjob, appearance is important. This is essential preparation for the classroom. She gets $500,000 per year teaching English to students who pay for their lessons. They expect her to look smart. My income is around $500,000. I think I can do that, because I can manage a big size classroom. The more students I have, the more money. Part of my income is coming from online. Every month, she teaches 1000 students in an actual classroom. But another 200,000 online. Hello, everyone. She has a radio programme and she writes textbooks. All adding up to that $500,000. This is very driven teaching. She is very animated, moving very energetically along a prearranged script. These children want to learn. They are paying money. Or their parents are paying money. And Gwen Lee has the accoutrements of business, like a chauffeur. Her day is so tightly packed that she needs to use every moment. Her headquarters, from where the teaching is organised, are in Seoul’s business district. Lunch is a business meeting with her assistants, who deal with online requests. This is work at hyperspeed. Koreans work hard. We work around the clock. They make the best effort, because it is coming from their parent’s generation. We saw our parents. They went to war. In order to survive, they have to work hard. South Korea is a pressurised country. with pressure on students to achieve and pressure on teachers to deliver grades. Gwen Lee goes to the gym. Even this is part of work. She believes that keeping fit is a way of fending off illness. When you have 200,000 students, you cannot afford to take time off. A quick look at the markets.

Thomas Cook says two hotel staff convicted in connection with the deaths of two British children have been found working in hotels where the company sends holidaymakers. Bobby and Christi Shepherd were killed by carbon monoxide poisoning while on a holiday in Corfu in 2006. Our Business Editor - Kamal Ahmed - reports. Christi and Bobby Shepherd, the faces of two children marking all that is wrong in the relationship between a grieving family and a multinational company. Today, their parents finally met the CEO of the corporate giant. No one can give us back our children, no one can erase the lifelong pain for their family and friends. We cannot change the past and we accept it may be time to look to the future. The father of the Christi and Bobby said Thomas Cook would now make donations to a series of charities close to the family. Why has it taken Thomas Cook so long to meet the family? That is what I regret as well, that I was not meeting and trying to meet them at the very beginning when I took over in November 2014. To be honest, that should have happened long before, but this is exactly what probably was my biggest mistake. Tonight, more controversy. Two hotel workers convicted following the deaths of Christi and Bobby were discovered to be working as recently as yesterday in hotels still used by Thomas Cook. One was this man, the manager of the hotel where the children died. When he found out, the chief executive of Thomas Cook said he felt physically sick. When I was aware of it, we acted very fast. The manager was out yesterday evening. I havejust finished interviewing the head of Thomas Cook at their central London headquarters. His words of contrition certainly sounded genuine but after today’s shocking revelations this is a company that has a long way to go to rebuild public trust. The parents of the Christi and Bobby want the bungalow where the children died to be turned into a memorial playground. This tragedy has left a stain on the reputation of Thomas Cook, a family that had to battle for years for a company to recognise their loss. Time now for all the sports news in Sport Today Hello. This is Sport Today. I’m Chris Mitchell and we’re live from the BBC Sport Centre. Coming up for you: If you go, Figo! It’s a two-horse race for the FIFA presidency. Michael van Praag and now Luis Figo pull out. Roots of recovery — he’s out for 98 but saves England’s blushes against New Zealand. Francesco Molinari leads the way after the first round at the PGA Championship in England. What a parting shot! Luis Figo says FFIA is a dictatorship under Sepp Blatter. Hello. This is Sport Today. The former Portuguese footballer has dropped out of the race to be the next FIFA President. He said he couldn’t be a part of what he called an election process designed for the delivery of absolute power to one man. Figo also said FIFA are living under a dictatorship while they hold court with Sepp Blatter, the current President. And he said the May 29 ballot is not a normal electoral act. He continued, saying he has encountered hypocrisy among federation presidents and that people who wanted to speak out had been silenced. Just hours earlier, Dutch candidate Michael van Praag withdrew as a candidate for the top job. He’s switched his support to Prince Ali, who will now be the sole man to try and stop Blatter from extending his 17—year reign at the top. This campaign was always about a need to bring football forward and improve FIFA and it still is. This is why the three of us sat down to discuss our chances. We also concluded that we believe that one single candidate will have a bigger chance to win the election. Prince Ali convincingly demonstrated that at this moment in time he is the candidate who has the biggest chance to challenge Sepp Blatter. The BBC has learned that Napoli coach Rafael Benitez is a leading contender to become the new man in charge of Real Madrid. The present coach Carlo Ancelotti is expected to leave Real after this weekend’s final game of the season. Talks are understood to have taken place between both parties. The Spaniard started his coaching career with the Real youth team and reserves. English Premier League side West Ham have also believed to have made contact with Benitez. Copa Libertadores quarterfinal first—leg matches continue on Thursday. One of them is already over, with Guarani of Paraguay beating Racing Club of Argentina. Racing played the whole of the second half with only ten men after Luciano Lollo was sent offjust before half time for the use of an elbow. Replays show he did make contact with Federico Santander, although the contact didn’t warrant the reaction from Santander. Despite their numerical advantage, Guarani didn’t make the breakthrough until five minutes from time. Watch for the celebration. julian Benitez with the only goal of the game. The second leg takes place next Wednesday. So, Guarani beat Racing 1—0. River Plate played Cruzeiro. The score is 1—0 to Cruzeiro. Joe Root and Ben Stokes narrowly missed out on centuries the last ball of the day. Joe Wilson reports. New Zealand’s cricketers are here to take the most of opportunities. They only have two test matches. On a Thursday morning in May, with the a Thursday morning in May, with the wicket looking nice and green, they wicket looking nice and green, they win the toss and they are going to win the toss and they are going to bowl. We know they have the bowlers to make the most of those kinds of conditions. And so it proved. A team fragile in confidence could easily implode from there. It is one thing for England to talk about moving forward, playing positive cricket, but it is another thing to do it. With Ben Stokes and Joe Root, that is exactly how they responded. Stokes knows that the best form of defence is attack. The sad thing for them is that they both fell short of their personal century. Used to playing Twenty20 cricket, the New Zealand bowlers tired visibly during a Test match day. England can certainly point to a day of genuine progress. Obviously disappointing to get out so close to a century at Lord’s but we are in a really good position now and obviously the partnership but carried on really well between Mo and Jos. I think the way we started was fantastic. m: We asked some good questions. I think they did very well and looking at our performance, I think we bowled some very good balls. L111: But we did let it off the hook a bit. But we did let it off the hook a hit. They But we did let it off the hook a bit. They started building momentum bit. They started building momentum into lunch. I think we regrouped well after lunch. Shahid Afridi says he is honoured to be playing international cricket in Pakistan again. They take on Zimbabwe on Friday. If you’re affected by flash photography, please look away for the next 30 seconds. The two Twenty205 and three one day games between the two nations are the first internationals on home soil for Pakistan since 2009. Afridi and his opposite number Elton Chigumbura showed off the trophy they will be playing for. No Test—playing country has visited Pakistan since militants attacked the Sri Lankan team bus six years ago, killing eight people and injuring seven players. Zimbabwe are being protected by a level of security usually reserved for heads of state, involving 6,000 policemen, paramilitary troops and helicopters. The Volkswagen of Andreas Mikkelsen was quickest on the first day of the Rally de Portugal. In a specially—devised stage where two cars race head—to—head, Mikkelsen clocked a best time ofjust over three minutes for the three—mile test. That was faster than his Volkswagen team—mates Sebastien Ogier and Jeri—Matti Latvala, who came in second and third. Mads Ostberg and his co—driver had a lucky escape after rolling his Citroen across the track. He managed to get the car back on its wheels to end the Shakedown stage in 12th position. The rally proper starts on Friday with six stages and a total competitive distance of almost 81 miles. Francesco Molinari leads after the first round of the PGA Championship at Wentworth here in England. He’s seven under per, two shots clear of Sweden’s Robert Karlsson. World number one Rory Mcllroy is a further four shots back on one under. Styled as the flagship event Styled as the ﬂagship event of Styled as the flagship event of the European Tour, the PGA Championship attracted record numbers to Wentworth for the opening round and the crowd witnessed not just one but two holes in one. One bounce and it was in asJohnson claimed the second ace of his career and earned himself a brand—new car from the sponsors in the process. Last year’s winner Rory Mcllroy described the start of his title defence as just OK. He faces a possible fine for throwing a club in frustration at the 17th but he held himself in check well enough to shoot a one under par 71. But room for improvement. Among the big names ahead of him is Miguel AngelJimenez. Despite two bogeys in his first three holes, the Spaniard birdied four of the last six to end the day in a tie for third place. Leading the way is Italy’s Francesco Molinari. He produced a birdie—birdie finish and a bogey—free round of 65, seven under par, and is two shots clear of the field overnight. Ifelt like I left a couple out there but when I looked at the leaderboard, I’m only a few shots off the lead. I didn’t feel that any aspect of my game was really off today but at the same time, ﬂ Ididn’t do I didn’t do anything that could either. So, there is definitely room for improvement over the next few days. This is obviously our flagship event. It’s a great start but unfortunately nothing more than that. You don’t get the trophy on the first day. I have to keep my head down and do the same tomorrow and on Sunday and see if that is going to be enough.

And a Korean air executive jailed for throwing a tantrum over how she was served nuts has been freed. Hello. President Obama has insisted the United States is not losing the war against the jihadists who call themselves Islamic State. Here’s our World Affairs Editor john Simpson. With this latest success, capturing notjust the historic city of Palmyra but the important Al—Hail gasfield outside it, the self—styled Islamic State now controls 50% of Syria’s territory. The sheer savagery of IS has worked superbly well. It paralyses its enemies with terror. ""We are coming for you,"" he says, with disturbing calm. ""With men who love death as much as you love life, you will never be safe as long as we are alive."" Palmyra, one of the world’s great classical cities, is now defenceless. when it ran, Islamic State destroys all vestiges of the non—Islamic past. The speed of the IS advance has been quite extraordinary. Yesterday it was Palmyra. Four days ago, it gained the important town of Ramadi in Western Iraq. A vast flood of terrified refugees pours along the roads out of Ramadi. Desperate to escape the vengeance of Islamic State. A mere 200 IS fighters captured the town, chasing out ten times that number of Iraqi soldiers. The people of the town feel utberty abandoned. This woman screams at the BBC... ""The government has let us down."" All that is only 60 miles away. Yet Baghdad feels calm and pretty relaxed tonight. Almost two thirds of the Iraqi army is based in and around the capital to protect it. The fall of Ramadi has given people a scare here, though the anxiety has started to fade now. But there is a definite feeling that the Iraqi army let the country down. While in America, some people are starting to blame it all on US policy. And yet Western officials here are confident that IS can and will be beaten. They believe Ramadi will be recaptured within weeks. Even so, the last few days have been a nasty shock. Staying in the region — and the Pentagon has admitted for the first time that its air strikes against Islamic State The head of the US—led coalition the unintentional loss of lives.

Do you think this war against IS is being think this war against IS is being won or lost? The war in Iraq is won or lost? The war in Iraq is certainly met some setbacks and certainly met some setbacks and there was not much incentive for the there was not much incentive for the Obama administration to go into Obama administration to go into Syria to fight ISIS. The Islamic Syria to fight ISIS. The Islamic State, this so—called caliphate, State, this so—called caliphate, controls a little over half of controls a little over half of Syrian territory and about one third Syrian territory and about one third of Iraqi territory. Along the of Iraqi territory. Along the Euphrates River, you can see that Euphrates River, you ran see that almost every Euphrates River, you can see that almost every major town and township almost every major town and township with the exception of one is with the exception of one is controlled by IS. Unfortunately, the controlled by IS. Unfortunately, the Iraqi Army in Iraq and the Syrian Iraqi Army in Iraq and the Syrian government in Syria and other Syrian government in Syria and other Syrian rebels are really not a good match rebels are really not a good match to fight and pushback against the to fight and pushback against the ISIS forces. It really does require ISIS forces. It really does require a better organised global coalition a better organised global coalition to fight this organisation. What are to fight this organisation. what are the to fight this organisation. What are the chances of that? What are the the chances of that? what are the options? The the chances of that? What are the options? The Iraqi or Syrian army’s options? The Iraqi or Syrian army’s likelihood of making games against likelihood of making games against ISIS are limited to none. The first ISIS are limited to none. The first thing the US can do is arm the thing the US ran do is arm the Kurds. thing the US can do is arm the Kurds. There has been a lot of Kurds. There has been a lot of objection coming from the government objection coming from the government in Baghdad not to arm a regional in Baghdad not to arm a regional government in the north of Iraq. government in the north of Iraq. Arming the Kurds is one thing. They Arming the Kurds is one thing. They have proven to be rather loyal US have proven to be rather loyal US allies and pro—Western. That would allies and pro-Western. That would enhance allies and pro—Western. That would enhance our chances in Iraq. The enhance our chances in Iraq. The second thing that we can do is take second thing that we ran do is take our second thing that we can do is take our enemies. It is true that Iran is our enemies. It is tme that Iran is not necessarily our enemies. It is true that Iran is not necessarily an ally but the not necessarily an ally but the Iranians are now supporting Shi’ite Iranians are now supporting Shi’ite militia who are now in a bitter militia who are now in a bitter fight with ISIS. It would be prudent fight with ISIS. It would be pmdent to supply our fight with ISIS. It would be prudent to supply our support for those to supply our support for those militia helping the Iraqi army fight militia helping the Iraqi army fight ISIS. And third, commit some boots ISIS. And third, commit some boots to the ground. I’m not saying to to the ground. I’m not saying to send in the third infantry division send in the third infantry division or go for a full—scale invasion like or go for a full-stab invasion like in 2003 or go for a full—scale invasion like in 2003 but did what we did last in 2003 but did what we did last week in Syria. Commit some special week in Syria. Commit some special forces to the ground to carry out forces to the ground to carry out attacks and take out targets, as attacks and take out targets, as well as height —— high—value targets well as height -- high-value targets for well as height —— high—value targets for interrogation.

Very quickly, when we took back Ramadi in 2006 and when we took back Ramadi in 2006 and 2007 during the Iraq War, there were 2007 during the Iraq War, there were thousands of sorties being flown. We thousands of sorties being ﬂown. We have not thousands of sorties being flown. We have not seen anything like this. have not seen anything like this. This is not yet a full campaign. This is not yet a full campaign. Thank you. The US Navy has released video of a surveillance flight over the South China See, which has led to tensions with Beijing. The US surveillance plane was repeatedly told to leave the area by the Chinese Navy. The Poseidon aircraft was flying over artificial islands being created by China in disputed waters. Following the exchange, Beijing said it’s entitled to monitor the airspace and sees to protect its sovereignty. Washington has tried to play down the incident. The head of the Boy Scouts of America has described the ban on openly gay adult volunteers as unsustainable. Robert Gates, who was previously US Defence Secretary, has told the Scouts’ AGM the policy won’t be change but he did raise the possibility of the ban being lifted soon. Zach Wahls is the executive director of Scouts for Equality. Hejoins me now from Washington. This is definitely a good step forward but there should be no doubt forward but there should be no doubt that there is a lot of good work that there is a lot of good work left to do. In terms of where the left to do. In terms of where the Boy Scouts of America were left only Boy Scouts of America were left only a year ago, this is a complete a year ago, this is a complete about—face. Last year, the president about—face. Last year, the president about-face. Last year, the president of the Boy about—face. Last year, the president of the Boy Scouts of America said of the Boy Scouts of America said they would not go through this issue they would not go through this issue again during his time and it is again during his time and it is clear that the calculation has now clear that the ralmlation has now shifted clear that the calculation has now shifted for the Scouts and we are shifted for the Scouts and we are very pleased to see very pleased to see him moving towards full equality. It is quite a towards full equality. It is quite a Christian organisation in the US, Christian organisation in the US, the Boy Scouts of America. Will the Boy Scouts of America. will there the Boy Scouts of America. Will there be a lot of opposition? Is not there be a lot of opposition? Is not necessarily Christian but it is necessarily Christian but it is religious. There will be some religious. There will be some opposition but my understanding is opposition but my understanding is that as Robert Gates finished his that as Robert Gates finished his remarks he received a standing remarks he received a standing ovation. It seems he has figured out ovation. It seems he has figured out a message that has been received a message that has been received well by leaders and even though it well by leaders and even though it is not entirely clear what the is not entirely clear what the timeline looks like, it is clear timeline looks like, it is clear that he does have support from the that he does have support from the leadership. I guess that he does have support from the leadership. I guess it sponsored by churches, religious organisations, and so they have organisations, and so they have quite a lot of work ahead of them in quite a lot of work ahead of them in convincing their stakeholders like convincing their stakeholders like the Mormon Church and the Catholic the Mormon Church and the Catholic Church. I don’t think that there is Church. I don’t think that there is any doubt after this speech today any doubt after this speech today when he made it very clear that when he made it very clear that there is a very serious evidence the there is a very serious evidence the two address this issue. —— a serious two address this issue. -- a serious urgency in two address this issue. —— a serious urgency in addressing this issue. It urgency in addressing this issue. It is clear urgency in addressing this issue. It is clearfrom what urgency in addressing this issue. It is clear from what you are saying is clear from what you are saying that some groups are already that some groups are already planning to ignore the ban. Will planning to ignore the ban. will there planning to ignore the ban. Will there be no action against them? there be no action against them? That is right. Six weeks ago, the That is right. Six weeks ago, the greater New York councils decided to greater New York councils decided to defy the ban on gay adults. They defy the ban on gay adults. They hired an openly gay Eagle Scout and hired an openly gay Eagla Scout and what hired an openly gay Eagle Scout and what Robert Gates made clear today what Robert Gates made clear today was that there would be no punitive was that there would be no punitive action taken against them, which is action taken against them, which is a great sign. It is also a good sign a great sign. It is also a good sign to councils across the country who to councils across the country who were also voiced their opposition to were also voiced their opposition to the ban. Nearly 13 councils across the ban. Nearty13 councils across the country the ban.

Top Gear is one of the BBC’s most popular programmes, with millions of viewers around the world. But earlier this year, the main presenter of the show was forced to leave after a bust—up with one of his producers. Now, Jeremy Clarkson has admitted it was his own fault and that leaving the programme has left a big hole in his life. Colin Paterson has more. Jeremy Clarkson back at the BBC for his first interview since he was told two months ago that his Top Gear career was over. He told Chris Evans that he was still coming to terms with losing his job for an unprovoked physical and verbal attack on one of Top Gear’s producers. It was my own silly fault, so I can hardly complain. And what are you saddest about if it is all comparable? Having to leave Top Gear or having to stop working for the BBC? Equal, actually. I do like the BBC. There are some dreadful people in it but there are also some really talented people. Tomorrow, jeremy Clarkson will be reunited with Richard Hamilton and james May for the start of the Top Gear Live tour but it could be months before any television projects are announced. It was very sudden. You don’tjustjump into something. You have to have a look at what is out there. Before he went off in his Ferrari, Jeremy Clarkson said he was not ruling out a return to the BBC, as although his contract was not renewed, he was never actually sacked. This Saturday, millions will tune in for the final of the Eurovision Song Contest, the quest to find Europe’s best new song. ...ish. But this year there’s one very big difference — a wild card entry from the other side of the world. For the first time, Australia is competing. We have been following Australia’s Eurovision fans as they make their way to the annual competition. It’s 6:303m on Friday the 15th of May and we are about to leave the house. 31 hours later and we made it! Welcome to the Eurovision Song Contest 2015. Go Australia! Australia! Woooo! Someone had tears in their eyes when they found out that Australia would be joining the contest. It was very surprising. It was completely unexpected. We hadn’t seen this coming at all but we were really proud in that moment. I didn’t know what to expect. I had seen it from Australia but actually be here and absorb the culture and all of the excitement around the event is really mind—blowing. I can’t wait for Saturday. I think it’s bonkers. I’m very welcoming for Australia but... If it is a guest spot, that would be one thing. But I think they will be here forever. I think people would be less upset if they actually had to qualify. Are you ready to see Guy Sebastian? CHEERING AND APPLAUSE. SINGING. I think if we win the competition, it would be an interesting situation for all of the Eurovision fans. I don’t think they will know how to take it. We’ll be over the moon. We’ll be, like, crazy! Thank you, Europe! CHEERING AND APPLAUSE. Two drivers have been jailed over a Fast and Furious—style race Beijing when they crashed. And woman passenger in the Lamborghini suffered a fractured Lamborghini suffered a fractured spine.

Thursday turned out to be a pretty decent day across the greater part of England and Wales simply because you were that much further away from all of this cloud, which made for a rather wet spell of weather certainly for northern and north—western parts of Scotland. As we embark on Friday, so we will drag that weather front a bit closer to the British Isles, moistening things up in England and Wales, just progressing down across Scotland and Northern Ireland in the first part of the day. Some sunshine in the mix and that will be the case across East Anglia and the south—east. As soon as you break away to the north or west, that is where you run into much more cloud. Towards that front, the odd burst of rain coming into the western slopes of the Pennines. Generally speaking, cloud will begin to thin as that weather front gradually eases away out of Scotland and out of Northern Ireland and brighter skies follow behind. The consequence of shifting that weather front further south is to rob eventually East Anglia and parts of the south—east of that bright start from lunchtime into the afternoon. We may find some rain but because of that bright start, temperatures will be around 20 degrees. Brighter skies behind, yes, but a fresher feel to proceedings in the late afternoon and early evening. Saturday will be decent and on Sunday, rain moves from the north—west to the south—east. Come Monday, the sunshine returns for many of us. Here’s the process. We start to build in the area of high pressure for the beginning of the bank holiday weekend. That settles things very nicely indeed. A lot of sunshine around. Look at this — dry weather across eastern Scotland, the greater part of England and Wales. But there has to be a fly in the ointment. This weather system will come in later in the day around western Scotland and Northern Ireland, bringing bits and pieces of rain there. But conditions won’t be bad and temperatures will be in the teens for many of us. That weather front introduces fresher weather in the north with temperatures never better than 11 or 12. Some mild conditions still left over from that weather front. Then the rain will move in and temperatures will be pushed well on into the teens. The wind will flick around to the north—west, so there will be a fresher feel for many of us on bank holiday Monday. Quite a lot of fine weather around and sunshine with variable cloud. As the temperatures reach the midteens, there may be enough in those clouds to bring one or two showers. For a bank holiday, not too bad at all. The latest headlines. President Obama has described the loss of the Iraqi city of Ramadi and the Syrian city of Palmyra to the militant group, Islamic State, as a tactical setback. He said he did not think the US and Iraqi governments were losing the fight against the jihadists and promised more help for the security forces. In Baltimore, a grand jury has brought charges against six police officers in connection with the death of a black man after he suffered neck injuries during his arrest. The officers are to appear in court inJuly. The case of Freddie Gray sparked violent protests last month. Now on BBC News, time for HARDtalk. Welcome to HARDtalk. When the self—styled Islamic State movement took control of Ramadi, the capital of Iraq’s Anbar province, it was another humiliation for the Iraqi government. The United States has bombed IS, but failed to neutralise the jihadist threat. My guest is Emma Sky, 3 British woman who was a senior adviser to the US military in Iraq until 2010. should America and the West do now? Emma Sky, welcome to HARDtalk. Thank you. Let us talk about Iraq today, it is in a terrible mess. The country is deeply fragmented, territory in the hands ofjihadists militants. Given your involvement, your experience until 2010, I wonder whether you feel any sense of personal involvement, even responsibility for what is happening. When I look at Iraq today, it is obviously tragic. And Ifeel angry, Ifeel very sad. It did not have to end up how it is today. But after 2003 it was inevitable. Decisions taken from then onwards had consequences. Iraq could have had a different future, a future without Islamic State. Before we pick away at what you did and what you thought at the time, in terms of a chain of events and responsibilities, the fact you were a senior adviser to the US military up until 2010, does that give you a sense of personal responsibility? I feel a sense of great sadness. Do I feel I made decisions that led to the situation we see today, no. No part of any collective guilt? I was part of the coalition. But when you look at what happened today, there is responsibility on the coalition side and on the Iraqi side. Let us go back and tell a little bit about your remarkable story. Your involvement did not start until 2003. You had never been to Iraq until 2003. I had never been. So you saw an advertisement looking for people with skills to help the post occupation authority, the US dominated coalition authority in Iraq. Despite the fact you had never been there, you decided to go and help. I was against the war. I signed up to be a human shield in the first Gulf War. So you had strong feelings about US involvement in Iraq. Yes. The British government asked for volunteers to administer the country or three months before we handed it back to the Iraqis. I thought it was my opportunity to apologise to everybody for the war and help them rebuild their country. I spent a decade in Israel—Palestine to build up the institutions of the Palestinian Authority. You spoke Arabic. I spoke Arabic. I had experience in conflict resolution. Let me go out there and help them rebuild their country. In the end, it was much more than three months. You had two stints. Three stints. Mostly it was in Kirkuk in the north, where you were a civilian working alongside the military to try and establish some kind of stability and order in that region. It strikes me that it is symptomatic of the problems we have seen in Iraq that you had such a senior position with no knowledge of Iraq whatsoever. You should never have been in the position. Sure, when I left the UK I had one phone call before I left. They told me fly find there, you will be met by somebody with a sign with your name on it. They did not tell me what myjob would be. I assumed there must have a job for me to do. I ﬂaw out, nobody was expecting me at all. I made my way to Baghdad, went to the Republican Palace. Spent a week trying to understand what was going on. They said, we have got enough people here. Try the north, try Mosul. And then they said, go to Kirkuk. They told me, I was the senior civilian. You’re basically in charge of the province. In the first week, I was blown up. Welcome to your newjob. You survived to tell the tale, thank goodness. What I want to focus on is your change, a personal change and a change in the way professionally you saw your role. You had gone out as an anti—war protester, in a sense. You wanted to apologise for the Iraqi people. You were working for months and months as a senior figure in the US—led occupation. Working alongside US troops who, to be blunt, were pretty brutal in their approach to establishing their control of territory inside Iraq. You must have made some huge moral compromises. Ijust want housing. huge moral compromises. I brought my laptop on which I had downloaded the fourth Geneva convention. I read it to him, article by article. I said, if I find you are violating those articles, I will take you to the Hague. I did not know you could not take them to the Hague. Americans were not under the International Criminal Court. I got to work closely with this Colonel. I was the first civilian that he was going to hand over to. The US military surprised me enormously. They had degrees from Harvard and Yale. People had experience from the Balkans. It was not very violent. It was much more a matter of getting Iraqis back in control of their province and mediating between the different groups. It strikes me, even as you tell that story, in the course of working with the occupation force, maybe they changed you more than you changed them. It was definitely a 2—way matter. Definitely. For me, when I first went out, I said, OK, I have got to work with the Americans. For them, they have not got experience in Middle Eastern countries. I had not been to Iraq, but I had been in the Middle East, over a decade. In comparison with them, I knew much more about the culture and the peoples. They realised I was more experienced in terms of nationbuilding and institutional development than they were. They wanted my help to change what they were doing. The question is how much they really changed what they were doing as a result of influence from people like you. You spent a lot of time with them. To go through your story, you left Iraq and you came back. You came back at the request of a senior officer who became the lead US general in Iraq. You served him as his special adviser from 2007—2010. A crucial period when the Americans were trying to build a new Iraq after all of the sectarian violence. Why did you believe, as I assume you did, that he and his US troops in Iraq could fundamentally change that country? I am not sure that I did in the beginning. When he asked me to come back. I am not sure I did believe that we could change the situation around. But when I met him, he had been the boss of the colonel I had been working with. He said, I need to go back and do this job. I want you to come as my adviser. It was not something I wanted to do. He was somebody I respected. It is highly unusual. You were a young British woman with no military experience. It is now putting you in a position in Baghdad, advising the top US general in the country during a highly contentious occupation. Putting you in an almost impossible position. I had only come out of Afghanistan when he contacted me and asked me to come back. He said, I have seen the influence you had in the brigade. You’ve got a completely different approach. You are a completely different perspective. I learnt the limits of military force. I want you to come with me, I want you to come all the meetings, talk about the meetings beforehand. Afterwards, I want you to help me see things from different angles. Those early days, Iraq was in a disastrous situation. The country was in a civil war. Mass population displacement. Dead bodies on the streets. We were charged to try and turn this around. I was helping him understand why Iraqis use violence. You thought there was some kind of military into solution. Did you really believe that? I have my doubts. I thought I could be useful to him. I had my doubts. I thought the more we go out, the more resistance we would face. But times have changed. Because Iraq had descended into civil war. 2007, Iraqis were more scared of each other than they of us. They looked to us to save them from themselves, to save them from each other. The environment had changed. When we put the troops back, when the mission was to protect the people from the insurgents, from the terrorists, it was a different mission, 3 different approach. The mindset of the US military had changed considerably from 2003. It was a fundamental different change in approach. What you have said is so interesting. It raises questions about today. You describe the situation of civil war, communal sectarian violence destroying Iraq in that period. Right now, today, we see Iraq being destroyed and fragmented all over again. The difference is there are no US troops on the ground at all. not having great effect. I want you to reflect on your experience to tell me what you think is happening. And what you think of Western strategy in Iraq today. When you look at the whole war from 2003 until today, it was only from 2070 2009 that the US had the right strategy, the right leadership, the right resources. Things in Iraq started to go in the right direction. Iraqis felt and the coalition felt that Iraq is on the right path. Things started to go bed from 2010 onwards. This came after a closely contested election in 2010. All Iraqis of different backgrounds turned out to participate. This was the election in which the Shia political bloc, led by Nouri al—Maliki, the incumbent minister, was battling against a more secular bloc. He was Shia, but reached out to secular Iraqis. It was not a democratic exercise entirely without flaws. But the reality was the man who could form a ruling bloc. That is what happened. The guy who won the election was not given the opportunity to have first go at trying to form the government. There was a dispute within the US system on what approach to take. The general believed that the winning bloc should have first go at trying to form the government. He did not think he would be able to do it on his own. He thought it might lead to an agreement with the reality to share power. The general thought the US should uphold the right of the winning bloc to have first go and the US should help curb that deal. The embassy did not have the same opinion. You had a new ambassador who did not have experience in the region. The new ambassador did not have experience in the region. This is experience in the region. This is ambassador Christopher Hill. You ambassador Christopher Hill. You have written in your memoir that ambassador Christopher Hill. You have written in your memoir that: You have said that the ambassador hated Iraq and he hated Iraqis. You said he got the approach entirely wrong. There were two approaches being put forward. At the end of the day, it was Vice President Biden who made the decision and he decided Nouri Al—Maliki was our men and we should stick by him. Al—Maliki would give us a follow on security agreement to keep troops in the country. But the Americans were not able to get the other groups to support Al—Maliki and that’s when the Iranians stepped in and put pressure on the different Shia parties, especially the Sadrists, to support Nouri Al—Maliki. I need to keep the big picture in mind. Here you are, a woman in Iraq who went to the country because you were a peacenik who wanted to say sorry for US interventionism. Now, you say the US should have been more interventionist during the Obama administration years, should have been more proactive in choosing an Iraqi leader to do business with, that they got it wrong when they supported Nouri Al—Maliki. And you seem to suggest that the Americans, when they headed for the exit door, rushed out of Iraq far too quickly with all of their military equipment and personnel. For all of those years, America played a key role in trying to create agreements between the political elites. In 2010, the political elites could not reach an agreement on their own. They needed a broker and I believe America should have been that broker. And you think that could have been healthy or sustainable, America in essence dictating who should control Iraq’s future? No, it was not about choosing who should be prime minister but mediating between the different groups so they could select a candidate. Do you still think even today that the US troops should have stayed longer in Iraq? Obama had been elected on the basis that US public wanted those troops out. It was not about keeping troops in Iraq, it was about reaching a political agreement between the elites. When that political agreement was not reached, when the Iranians stepped in and pressured the Sadrists to support Al—Maliki, that was worrying and we saw the Sunnis withdrawing from the political process. Nouri Al—Maliki went after them and pushed out the Sunni politicians who had fought against Al-Qaeda. He reneged on the promises he’d made to them and there were mass arrests of Sunnis. That led to a sense of disenfranchisement among the Sunnis, which allowed the Islamic State today to rise up. Are you saying that with your inside knowledge of what happened in Iraq in 2010 and your close attention to it since that Barack Obama bears significant responsibility? That he, Biden and the other senior policymakers bear significant responsibility for the chaos and the rise of Islamic State that we see in Iraq today? Some responsibility, yes. But the biggest responsibility ultimately goes back to the decision to invade Iraq based on the premise of weapons of mass destruction, which Iraq did not have. Iraq descended into civil war. The surge took Iraq out of the civil war but the mistakes made in 2010 left Iraq unstable because people lost faith in the political process. What do you think the US and its Western allies should be doing today? Is Iraq any sort of unitary state at all? Do you believe that Iraq as we have known it is finished and gone? Iraq today is very weak. I don’t know what Iraq will be in the future. I don’t know which way it goes. There is still a land there and still a people there. What will come next is very hard to predict but the region has become unbalanced by the war in Iran’s favour and that has set off a massive geopolitical struggle between Iran and the Gulf states, which leads them to supporting extreme actors in different countries in all these proxy wars. So, in that context, the US and other Western countries have some choices to make. The choice the Americans have made thus far is to use aerial power in a limited way against Islamic State militants both in Iraq and in Syria but not to countenance in any way putting troops back on the ground. The Saudis, for example, the formerforeign minister said quite recently that this is a fundamental mistake and it is allowing Iran to take over the country. Do you agree? Iran is very powerful in Iraq today. The strongest person in Iraq today is Iranian, not Iraqi. I’m guessing you mean the head of the Al-Quds Revolutionary Guard Force. Yes. Iran is very powerful in Iraq today and this has caused this dynamic throughout the region as other countries try to counter Iran’s influence. But with respect, Iran is very important, is it not, as a potential partner of US and Western interests in Iraq today because the Iranians with their backing of the Shia militia are the only fighting force that can that ran put up credible opposition to the Islamic State. We saw it in Tikrit and we will probably see it in Ramadi as well. If the US is saying, as it is, that the current most serious threat to US interests is thejihadists of Islamic State, surely you should be advocating a reach—out to all of Tehran from Washington and London. Well, things have become incredibly complicated. On the one hand, you can say that the Iranian—backed Shia militia are the strongest force. On the other hand, Iran benefits from the rise of the Islamic State because it has been able to establish its power through Iraq and also into Syria. It is the fear that the government in Baghdad is an Iranian—backed sectarian regime that led Sunnis to decide that maybe Islamic State is the lesser of two evils when compared with Al—Maliki’s regime. You are not suggesting, are you, that the Iranians in a Machiavellian conspiracy have actually fermented and backed the rise of Islamic State? No, I’m not suggesting that. But they can benefit from it. At the end of the day, for the Islamic State to be really destroyed it will require the Sunnis in Iraq to turn against Islamic State and defeat it. They will only do that when they see it can’t win, when there are better alternatives and when they are supported by the government of Iraq and the US. At the moment, we are not seeing that level of support to win over the Sunnis. I want to bring this back to personal thoughts. You have been on an amazing personal journey. You worked for the British Council as a cultural ambassador to the Middle East in way and then you found yourself by chance as much as anything deeply involved in a military occupation. Since then, you have been watching it from the US. Today, do you believe that there is still merits in the US using its military power to try and shape events in the Middle East? I think the main problem that America has is having a strategy for what it does. Military means should not be an end in itself. If you are going to use it, it is about how you bring about a political solution. I think what has happened too often is people have become fixated on the military aspect, killing bad guys, rather than what comes next, what comes after the Islamic State, how to have a betterfuture for the region. When you speak to young people in Iraq, they want to live in a country that looks like Dubai, not like Daesh, not like Islamic State. It is understanding that people throughout the Middle East, just like in the rest of the world, want to live normal lives. Is there anything we can do to help them? I think in some places there is. Are you going to continue to devote your professional life to the Middle East or are you starting thinking this is just not worth it? I spent ten years working in Israel—Palestine and that did not end well. And I have given almost a decade of my life focusing on Iraq and you have seen the situation today. That certainly has not ended well. So, for me, writing was trying to understand better what happened so we can learn the right lessons for the future and not make the same mistakes. Nothing that happened in Iraq after 2003 was inevitable. It could have gone down a different path or differentjunctions. Emma Sky, thank you forjoining us on HARDtalk. certainly for northern and north—western parts of Scotland. As we embark on Friday, so we will drag that weather front a bit closer to the British Isles, moistening things up in England and Wales, just progressing down across Scotland and Northern Ireland in the first part of the day. Some sunshine in the mix and that will be the case across East Anglia and the south—east. As soon as you break away to the north or west, that is where you run into much more cloud. Towards that front, the odd burst of rain coming into the western slopes of the Pennines. Generally speaking, cloud will begin to thin as that weather front gradually eases away out of Scotland and out of Northern Ireland and brighter skies follow behind. The consequence of shifting that weather front further south is to rob eventually East Anglia and parts of the south—east of that bright start from lunchtime into the afternoon. We may find some rain but because of that bright start, temperatures will be around 20 degrees. Brighter skies behind, yes, but a fresher feel to proceedings in the late afternoon and early evening. Saturday will be decent and on Sunday, rain moves from the north—west to the south—east. Come Monday, the sunshine returns for many of us. Here’s the process. We start to build in the area of high pressure for the beginning of the bank holiday weekend. That settles things very nicely indeed. A lot of sunshine around. Look at this — dry weather across eastern Scotland, the greater part of England and Wales. But there has to be a fly in the ointment. This weather system will come in later in the day around western Scotland and Northern Ireland, bringing bits and pieces of rain there. But conditions won’t be bad and temperatures will be in the teens for many of us. That weather front introduces fresher weather in the north with temperatures never better than 11 or 12. Some mild conditions still left over from that weather front. Then the rain will move in and temperatures will be pushed well on into the teens. The wind will flick around to the north—west, so there will be a fresher feel for many of us on bank holiday Monday. Quite a lot of fine weather around and sunshine with variable cloud. As the temperatures reach the midteens, there may be enough in those clouds to bring one or two showers. For a bank holiday, not too bad at all. Hello you’re watching BBC World News, I’m Adnan Nawaz. Our top story this hour President Obama insists the US isn’t losing the fight against Islamic State. Despite the Islamists taking control of Palmyra and Ramadi Washington insists it will recapture the lost territory. Welcome to the programme, other stories that we are keeping across for you: A grand jury in Baltimore indicts all six police officers charged over the death of Freddie Gray in police custody.

How the fallen giant of silicon valley is struggling to reinvent itself. Plus, lucrative lessons. We go to Seoul to meet the half a million dollar a year English teacher. President Obama has insisted the United States is not losing the war against the jihadists who call themselves Islamic State. With the extremists seizing control of Palmyra in Syria and Ramadi in Iraq, in just the past few days, the president has admitted there We’ve talked a lot about remedy, and that is a serious setback. —— that is a serious setback. -- Ramadi. In that is a serious setback. —— Ramadi. In a that is a serious setback. —— Ramadi. In along that is a serious setback. —— Ramadi. In a long conflict like Ramadi. In a long conﬂict like this, there Ramadi. In a long conflict like this, there will be days like we saw this, there will be days like we saw there, and there will be ebbs and there, and there will be ebbs and ﬂows. But we are sure the strategy ﬂows. But we are sure the strategy we have is the right one, the right we have is the right one, the right framework moving forward. The US air framework moving forward. The US air force, operating in and around force, operating in and around Ramadi, will continue to do so until Ramadi, will continue to do so until Ramadi is retaken. Our world affairs editor, John Simpson, is in the Iraqi capital Baghdad. From there, he has this assessment of the Islamic State group’s latest victories. With this latest success, capturing notjust the historic city of Palmyra but the important Al—Hail gasfield outside it, the self—styled Islamic State now controls 50% of Syria’s territory. The sheer savagery of IS has worked superbly well. It paralyses its enemies with terror. ""We are coming for you,"" he says, with disturbing calm. ""With men who love death as much as you love life, you will never be safe as long as we are alive."" Palmyra, one of the world’s great classical cities, is now defenceless. when it ran, Islamic State destroys all vestiges of the non—Islamic past. The speed of the IS advance has been quite extraordinary. Yesterday it was Palmyra. Four days ago, it gained the important town of Ramadi in Western Iraq. A vast flood of terrified refugees pours along the roads out of Ramadi. Desperate to escape the vengeance of Islamic State. A mere 200 IS fighters captured the town, chasing out ten times that number of Iraqi soldiers. The people of the town feel utberty abandoned. This woman screams at the BBC... ""The government has let us down."" All that is only 60 miles away. The fall of Ramadi has given people a scare here, though the anxiety has started to fade now. But there is a definite feeling that the Iraqi army let the country down. While in America, some people are starting to blame it all on US policy. And yet Western officials here are confident that IS can and will be beaten. They believe Ramadi will be recaptured within weeks. Even so, the last few days have been a nasty shock. One month after the death in police custody of a 25—year—old black man, Freddie Gray, six officers have been charged in the American city of Baltimore. A grand jury has made the decision, which includes a count of second degree murder against one of the officers. Catharina Moh reports. It is the footage that sparked outrage. Freddie Gray being dragged into a police van. He was handcuffed and shackled. He later died from a severe spinal injury sustained during his arrest. His death sparked a wave of protests across America over police violence towards black men. Officials promised a fair investigation into what happened. Six Baltimore officers were charged over his death. Now a grand jury has indicted them. Our investigation revealed that we had sufficient probable cause to bring charges against six police officers. As our investigation is continued, additional information has been discovered and, as is often the case, during an ongoing investigation charges can and should be revised 3 step on the evidence. The most serious offences remain, ranging from second—degree murder to assault. The grand jury did return an additional charge of reckless endangerment. Many praised prosecutors in Baltimore for their swift handling of the case. A lawyer for the officers said the men did nothing wrong and charges were first brought against them. All six will appear before a court inJuly.

They’re often referred to as man’s best friend, and it seems the close bond between humans and dogs began to happen much earlier than previously thought. Swedish scientists say dogs are now known to have evolved from wolves some 30,000 years ago, perhaps initially being adopted by humans as hunting companions. Our science correspondent, Pallab Ghosh, explains. Wolves evolved into dogs, but how and when did this first happened? and when did this first happened? And the close bond between dogs and And the dose bond between dogs and humans begin? And the close bond between dogs and humans begin? One theory is that humans begin?

Now a look at the Sport News. Next Friday, 209 people will decide who should lead football’s world governing body. At this time on Thursday, FIFA members had four choices, but today, it’s a straight contest between Prince Ali ofJordan and the incumbent, Sepp Blatter. There’s some flash photography coming up. On Thursday afternoon, the former Portugal captain Luis Figo pulled out of the race saying he couldn’t be a part of what he called an election process designed ""for the delivery of absolute power to one man"". He also claimed that next week’s ballot is ""not a normal electoral act’"" because people who wanted to speak out had been silenced. Earlier in the day, the head of the Dutch Football Association, Michael Van Praag also withdrew. TRANSLATION: This campaign was always about a need to bring football forward and improve FIFA and it still is. This is why the three of us sat down to discuss our chances. We also concluded that we believe that one single candidate will have a bigger chance to win the election. Prince Ali convincingly demonstrated that at this moment in time he is the candidate who has the biggest chance to challenge Sepp Blatter.

For Gwen Lee’sjob, appearance is important. They expect her to look smart. My income is around $500,000. I think I can do that, because I can manage a big size classroom.

She has a radio programme and she writes textbooks. All adding up to that $500,000. This is very driven teaching. She is very animated, moving very energetically along a prearranged script. These children want to learn. They are paying money. Or their parents are paying money. And Gwen Lee has the accoutrements of business, like a chauffeur. Her day is so tightly packed that she needs to use every moment. Her headquarters, from where the teaching is organised, are in Seoul’s business district. Lunch is a business meeting with her assistants, who deal with online requests. This is work at hyperspeed. Koreans work hard. We work around the clock.

Come Monday, the sunshine returns for many of us. Here’s the process. We start to build in the area of high pressure for the beginning of the bank holiday weekend. That settles things very nicely indeed. A lot of sunshine around. Look at this — dry weather across eastern Scotland, the greater part of England and Wales. But there has to be a fly in the ointment. Some mild conditions still left over from that weather front. Then the rain will move in and temperatures will be pushed well on into the teens. The wind will flick around to the north—west, so there will be a fresher feel for many of us on bank holiday Monday. Quite a lot of fine weather around and sunshine with variable cloud. As the temperatures reach the midteens, there may be enough in those clouds to bring one or two showers. For a bank holiday, not too bad at all. ",,

Inadequate and failing - the two London hospitals criticised by the health watchdog. The next wave of freeschools - applications open today in London. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. David Cameron has said he’s prepared for ""lots of ups and downs"" as he opens discussions with other European leaders on his intention to redraw Britain’s relationship with the European Union. The leaders are in Latvia to discuss relations with ex-Soviet states, but it’s the first opportunity Mr Cameron has had to discuss his proposed reforms since winning a second term in Downing Street. In the last few minutes a British official-- European official has said thatjean-Claude official-- European official has said that jean-Claude juncker will travel for talks with David Cameron. Arriving with a fresh electoral mandate and a referendum on EU membership to come, David Cameron announced what could be the start of a bumpy process on renegotiation and he spoke about managing expectations. There will be ups and downs, you will hear one day that this is impossible and the next that something is possible. But throughout one thing will be constant, my determination to deliver for the British constant, my determination to deliverfor the British people reform of the European Union so that they will get an in-and referendum before the end of 2017. He says he means to build alliances beginning with visits today and visits to Paris and Berlin next week. Other EU leaders wait to find out his demands. So far they have only a broad outline. Britain wants some restrictions on welfare payments for migrants, that will be difficult to negotiate, it wants an opt out from the aim of ever closer union with the peoples of Europe and it wants national parliaments to be given a bigger role in European Union law making. Other countries are keen to accommodate Britain where they can and there is appetite for reform elsewhere. But everyone has his or her red lines. Of course commissions are set to different for everyone but freedom of movement is the core value of the European Union. I personally am open to discuss them. I would not change the basic freedoms, freedom of movement being one of them, and saying no to all ideas of changes would be wrong as well. Over the last five years David Cameron has occasionally annoyed at the EU leaders by what they see as grandstanding, threats will not go down well. As this process begins he needs to strike a balance between playing to the gallery at home and seeking compromise with the rest of Europe. And this summit, mainly focused on Ukraine and other former Soviet states, serves as a reminder that there are plenty of other eight issues on the US agenda. Other countries want Britain to stay in but not at any cost -- countries want Britain to stay in but not at any cost -- plenty of other issues. Let’s get more from Chris in Riga. Already some support for the Prime Minister’s permission -- Already some support for the Prime Minister’s permission -- position. Are there things he will not be able to achieve? Yes, if he wanted to impose outright restrictions on freedom of movement I do not think that would succeed, and he knows it. Some things suggested in the last couple of years by his backbenchers like a wholesale repatriation of employment law, that’s not on the agenda at the moment. You must be realistic. If he wants to do things we have mentioned, and ensure that Britain’s rights will be guaranteed and protected, there is a real prospect of progress. This is why he will travel around Europe in the next few weeks and whyjean-Claude jonker will come to London on Monday. There’s a feeling that now that they know he has won the election and has a mandate they want to get on with this negotiation process as soon as possible. The Prime Minister needs to know who his friends are in Europe, do we know? Different friends on different issues. The most important will be Germany, the most influential country in European Union. And issues like some restrictions for welfare for migrants, and certainly on the EU becoming more efficient and competitive. Several countries feel the and competitive. Several countries feel the same way, many looked at the results of the European elections last year where anti-European Union parties progressed in many places and they took the message that if the US to work better for its citizens it needs to change the way that it does business. Thank you. A rape victim has received an apology - and £20,000 - from Hampshire police, after they accused her of lying about the attack. Two months after making her complaint, the woman was arrested on suspicion of perverting the course ofjustice, and she tried to kill herself. A man was later convicted of rape and jailed. Our Home Affairs correspondent, june Kelly reports. Three years 890 phone call from her daughter Laura, telling her that she had been raped. Laura knew the rapist and believed there was forensic evidence on her T-shirt that implicated him. But police did not test it properly. jackie, we are using pseudonyms with a family, described how detectives did not believe her daughter and began investigating her for lying. I was horrified. You expect them to do all they can to put the rapist away. In terms of their response, you will have learned that one officer was especially dismissive. He said to expletive Mac arrest her. Two months later, Laura had to be brought to her local police station, she has mental health problems and she was arrested and told she could be charged with perverting the course ofjustice. Her mental health deteriorated. She started self harming again. She made the attempts on her life because she could not cope. She tried to commit suicide twice? Yes. The Hampshire force is now apologising for letting Laura down from the start. Ido not put the victim at the centre of the investigation when it started and we did not conduct the investigation with enough rigour, enough detail, enough of the investigation with enough rigour, enough detail, enough oversight. Crucially, with empathy and compassion, which was missing. I am sorry that we conducted this investigation that way and I am sorry that we treated the victim in that way. It was six months after she was raped that she learned she was in the clear. Police had finally tested the T-shirt which confirmed the guilt of her rapist. He is now in prison. -- the guilt of her rapist. He is now in prison. -- it confirmed the guilt. A London cab driver has beenjailed for life, with a minimum term of 38 years, for the murder of an American soldier in a roadside bombing in Iraq in 2007. Anis Sardar from Wembley built bombs as part of a conspiracy to kill Americans fighting in the country. Sardar’s conviction in a UK court for his role in the Iraq insurgency has been hailed a ""landmark prosecution"". Police say they have prevented a 16-year-old girl from east London from travelling to Syria to join Islamic State. Scotland Yard acted on information given to them by the Daily Mail, which had been investigating the girl’s sister, a known recruiter for IS. The paper said she had intended to travel to the Syrian border, via Turkey and Switzerland in order to marry a jihadi fighter. Police described the case as a frightening example of how quickly social media can be used to groom vulnerable young people. Figures out this afternoon from the health regulator, Monitor, are likely to show that England’s leading health organisations, known as foundation trusts, have run up their first annual deficit. Added to the rest of the NHS trusts, including hospitals and ambulances services, it’s believed there was a total deficit of £800m. Our Health Editor Hugh Pym is here. What are we expecting from these figures? These are the leading NHS organisations in England covering hospitals, mental health services, ambulances, and so on. Normally they record a surplus across the girl. For the first time they have recorded a deficit, we understand, for 201l+-2015, the financial year. Add them to other NHS trusts and you get this total deficit across all these health providers in England. Where is the balance? Other parts of the NHS might have recorded surpluses, so when the Department of Health produce their annual report it is likely everything will have been made to balance, just. It’s an illustration of the continuing pressures on the NHS. These are the figures from last year, what of this year? It could be worse, the deficit considerably figure. -- year? It could be worse, the deficit considerably figure. -- bigger. They are having to pay more to agency BFE i’13ViIâ1g to pay TT’IOI’â to GQETICY I’1UI’SâS are having to pay more to agency nurses to get higher staff numbers after problems with patient care in the NHS, after what happened in the Midlands. Pressures are continuing to build. They say there could be a bigger deficit. People in government say, the Chancellor produced more money for the NHS in his last Autumn Statement, they can hardly produce more money now. -- Statement, they can hardly produce more money now. -- they can hardly expect more. I think there could be a stand-off in the winter. These demands for more moneyjust to keep the NHS going through winter in England will be heard for more loudly. Thank you. The government is considering changes to the broadcasting watchdog Ofcom to strengthen its powers to tackle extremism. But it’s refused to comment on a leaked document which suggests the Home Secretary, Theresa May, wanted Ofcom to have the right to approve programmes which could include extremist content before they are broadcast. Our Political Correspondent Carole Walker is in Westminster. How controversial is this? It would be a hugely controversial step. We know the comment has yet to finalise its counter extremism strategy which was delayed amid rows in the Coalition Government. At the time, Sajid javid, then the culture secretary and now Business Secretary, wrote to the Prime Minister about a plan that had been circulated by the Home Secretary which would allow Ofcom to intervene to prevent programmes being broadcast if they contained extremist material. Savagejavid made clear that Ofcom does not have that power at the moment-- Sajid javid. He still does not believe that power should be granted to Ofcom. He makes this point in a letter that was leaked to the Guardian, that this would change Ofcom from a body that oversees problems that have been broadcast into a sensor. This morning as bugs move the Prime Minister has stressed David Cameron’s commitment to free speech under the government did try to go ahead this -- speech under the government did try to go ahead this -- a spokesman for the Prime Minister has stressed this, it would cause an outcry among Conservative MPs, let alone the Prime Minister’s political opponents. So it looks unlikely to go ahead but they are still working on this card extremism strategy. We will have to wait until we get that before we know what power Ofcom has been given -- before we know what power Ofcom has been given -- still working on this count-extremism strategy. -- cou nt-extremism strategy. -- counter-extremism. Homes and businesses have been evacuated after builders uncovered an unexploded Second World War bomb near Wembley Stadium. The army says the device - thought to date from the early 1940s German air raids - poses ""a genuine risk to life"". But it appears this weekend’s football league playoffs will not be affected. Elisabeth Glinka reports. British army disposal experts worked through the night to try to defuse this 50 kilograms World War II bomb found on a building site on the edge of Wembley Park. 60,000 Londoners were killed by bombs like this one doing the Blitz and a 400 metre cord and remains in place around the site this lunchtime. Police say the device post a genuine risk to life. -- it posed a risk. A venue where people had been displaced as a result of the evacuation could stay at a local community centre, where they were given bed and board of night and given breakfast is morning. As a result of the operation 300 homes and businesses have been evacuated leaving to disruption for many in this part of London -- disruption for many in this part of London -- leading. I have been here since yesterday. I cannot leave and if I leave I cannot come back inside, it is frustrating. For the moment the operation is ongoing but with three football play-off finals taking place this weekend and thousands of fans from across the country coming here, it is hoped thatit country coming here, it is hoped that it can be concluded speedily and safety -- safely. The time is 1.15. Our top story this lunchtime. David Cameron meets other European leaders and says he will make his case for change in the EU. And still to come. The howls from history which tell us when wolves evolved into man’s best friend. And in the sport Liverpool refused to bow down to play power, they say Raheem Sterling is going nowhere and will honour the rest of his contract. The scale of the disaster was horrific - 100 years ago today Britain’s worst rail crash claimed the lives of 226 people. Three trains, including one packed full of members of the Leith Battalion of the Royal Scots on their way to the battlefront at Gallipoli, collided at Ouintinshill near Gretna Green. The resulting fire took 23 hours to put out. Two signalmen controlling the line were later both sent to prison. Today a memorial service attended by the Princess Royal and Scotland’s First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon has been held to remember the victims at the site. Our Scotland Correspondent, Laura Bicker, is there. The service has just finished here where the disaster happened 100 years ago today. Dozens of relatives travelled from all over the world to be here. This crash was exacerbated by a lethal mix of wooden carriages and gas which had leaked from lanterns. It turned the wreckage into a fireball and for the first time, the BBC has managed to reconstruct what may have happened. 500 Scottish soldiers are heading for the front line. Their train is late but they are making up time by travelling at over 70 mph, until they reach the border. A signal failure sealed their fate. They smashed head-on into a waiting train. Soldiers tried to free themselves from crushed and splintered wooden coaches but seconds later came the second disaster. A Glasgow-bound express train ploughed into the wreckage. The result was an inferno which took 23 hours to control. Young photographer Archie Tassell recorded the horror of that day. At Quintinshill, adjoining the embankments, there were 77 coffins, covered with black cloth laid out in the sunshine and there were relatives moving about from coffin to coffin trying to recognise the dead. 214 soldiers, three railway workers and nine passengers died. Among them was Robert Renwick whose family want him to be remembered. It’s up to the younger people to keep these men’s memories alive because we would not have today what we have got if it had not been for the sacrifice these men made. 100 years on, at a service of remembrance in Gretna, Robin Bell describes to Scotland’s First Minister how his father survived and saved others from the wreckage. Lieutenant Colonel Bell was also given the job of visiting the relatives of those who died. At the age of 21, it was a pretty awfuljob to go and visit all of the bereaved wives and mothers of his own platoon, he must have known them all. It is very much a Leith batallion. Today, the story of this often forgotten disaster is being passed on to a new generation. A day that remains the blackest in British rail history. Well, here at this railway track where hundreds died, it has been a chance for them to be remembered. Hundreds of soldiers died every day in World War I but did not die on the way to the front line. This was a chance for those who did not get the chance to win any medals to be remembered. A woman who alleged she was raped a a teenager by a member of the IRA was failed by Northern Ireland’s Public Prosecution Service. Mairia Cahill- a relative of one of the founders of the republican organisation - says the IRA covered up the abuse. In the last few minutes, a review has strongly criticised the prosecutor’s handling of the abuse claims and two other linked cases. Here’s our Ireland Correspondent Chris Buckler. Mairia Cahill was brought up in a republican area of Belfast and becoming his member of Sinn Fein, a political party with links to the IRA. She even appeared in an election broadcast for the party. Last year she gave up teenager she had been sexually abused by a member of the IRA and the organisation had tried to cover it up. I was told I could not tell anyone. The report strongly criticises how prosecutors in Northern Ireland handled the case and others of alleged abuse. The overall delay in the prosecution was unacceptable. It was regrettable that the listing date of the sexual abuse trial was postponed and the delays were not more robust Lee opposed. For Mairia Cahill it has been a long process. She says she was raped in 1997 at the age of 16. Three years later, she was forced to confront her alleged abuser in a kangaroo court, she alleges. Martin Morris denies the claims. Last year when Mairia Cahill withdrew her evidence, he was acquitted. I have a number of suggestions how it can be approved so I want to make sure that is hurt. No one else should be put through the trauma that I was put through. The scope of the report todayis through. The scope of the report today is limited. It does not look at suggestions that the IRA dealt with sexual abuse claims by forcing those who were accused to simply leave Northern Ireland. It has led to some concerns that suspected abusers could be living in Northern Ireland. That remains a worry for the police and prosecution. If I said ‘Somalia’ or ‘Mogadishu’ to you - you’d probably conjure up an image of civil war, of insurgents, of pirates. Not of peace, security, and even beach-life. But a country that had no functioning government for most of the past 25 years is now offering its people a quality of life unthinkable just a few years ago. After the withdrawal of Al Shabab militants from the capital in 2011 - as our Africa correspondent Andrew Harding now reports - Somalia is beginning to reap the benefits of progress and peace. Lido Beach on a Friday afternoon. It is not a scene you would normally associate with a city like Mogadishu. But the crowds here are evidence that Somalia’s war-torn capital is changing. There is even a police lifeguard. Do you think life is getting better here, safer? A little bit, we feel safe now. Now we are safe, we feel happy. Is it getting safer? Yes. It is better already. Now it is OK. Life is getting better. Everything is going well. Thank you. Mogadishu still faces big security challenges but what this packed beach tells us is quite how confident and optimistic people are about the future. It is also a reminder of Somalia’s famous entrepreneurial spirit. Life jackets, for example. A thriving trade rented by the hour to a generation who never had the chance to swim. TRANSLATION: Life is better now. Before there was no work for us but as the security improves, everything is getting better. And for Mogadishu’s new elites, half a dozen beach-side restaurants have reopened. A cacophony of foreign accents. Many here are back home after years away. I love it, it is really nice, I feel like we have made a life here. Yes, my kids really enjoy it. But the armed guards are a reminder of the risks here in a country still struggling with the basics. It happens everywhere in the world but here, what you expect? Two or three years ago there were no laws, corruption, but it is getting better. Over the years, things will change. Whoever had a gun had the law, but now people understand that there are laws and people have obey those laws. So, peace and progress here on the beach but will it last? England failed to build on yesterday’s fightback in the second day of the first Test against New Zealand at Lords. They lost their last three wickets for 35 runs finishing on 389 all out. New Zealand were going well on 44 at lunch. joe Wilson is at Lord’s for us. Through much of play yesterday, England were rampant but it is called a Test match because it is not supposed to be easy. We have seen England bat and bowled today and in both cases they were rather frustrated. As they tried to play a brand of cricket that will engage the public. Last week, Mourinho Ali was on duty as an ambassador trying to make the case for Cricket in state schools in Bethnal Green. Today he was at Lords batting for his country. -- Today he was at Lords batting for his country. -- Moeen Ali. It is one reason why he is so important for England. On 58, his innings ended. England needed the security of more runs on Friday morning but who would get them? Not Stuart broad, out for free. That’sjust get them? Not Stuart broad, out for free. That’s just touched free. That’sjust touched his bat. While james Anderson had some fun, this is the kind of thing that can infuriate a fielding team if it goes on too long. Anderson was out and find reactions by Matt Henry. England all out for 389. The champagne cork clearer had done his job, it is a full-time role at this ground. Taking wickets looked like hard work for England’s bowler. New Zealand’s opening batsmen looked content. It is all new for Mark Wood. An explosive new bowler picked for his ability to surprise the batsmen. just like that. It is not illegal delivery if his foot is over the line when he bowls, and so it was no ball, not out. Small margins but even on his debut, no excuses. Yes, a question of millimetres when a man is bowling at 93 mph. New Zealand are about to resume but they are still a long way behind. They’re man’s best friend - and it seems the close bond between humans and dogs began much earlier than we thought. Scientists say dogs are now known to have evolved from wolves some 30,000 years ago, and it’s believed they might have been adopted by humans as hunting companions. Our science correspondent Pallab Ghosh explains. HOWLING Wolves evolved into dogs, but how and when did this first happen, and the close bond between dogs and humans begin? One theory is that wolves began gathering around human communities when our ancestors settled down in one place to become farmers. Gradually, over time, the walls became part of the community. ~ -- Wolves. Until eventually they evolved into the dogs we know today. A new genetic study suggests that transition began much earlier. Swedish researchers analysed the DNA in this 35,000 year old wolf bone. Writing in the journal Current Biology, they say that genetically the creature was well on its way to becoming a dog. cubs and kept them in their encampment to act as sentinels to things that were threatening the people who live there. Or possibly they used these early dogs as an aid in hunting. So if dogs and humans evolved together over such a long time, it might explain the close bond that now exists between them and us. It shows the deep connection has existed between man and Wolves for many tens of thousands of years and thatis many tens of thousands of years and that is why people love dogs so much, they are part of our own revolution into a modern society. Look at this one, it looks nice. Scientists at this laboratory in Oxford are analysing thousands of dog bones from all over the world and are hoping to build up a picture of how Wolves gradually changed into the dogs we know today and how they became best friends. You’re watching the BBC News at One. Our top story today - David Cameron warns Europe’s leaders he will not waiver in his drive to change the terms of Britain’s membership. In a moment, we’ll have the weather plus the news where you are. But first, the sport. Plenty of sport away from the cricket, the Premier League season comes to a close this weekend and will it be Raheem Sterling’s last match for Liverpool? Contract talks scheduled for today were cancelled. Our reporter Ben Smith is at the the club’s Melwood training ground. Raheem Ra heem Sterling headlines this week after it emerged he told Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers he wants to leave the club this summer. He is one of the brightest prospects in English football yet having rejected a new contract he seems to believe that his future lies elsewhere. His agent was due to meet at Liverpool today, that was cancelled after comments that he made appeared in the public domain criticising Liverpool Football Club. Today it manager Brendan Rodgers had his say and insisted there was no way Stirling would be sold this summer. The facts are simple, whether he has talks not, there two years left on his contract at Liverpool and I expect him to see that two years through and continue to behave immaculately as he has done in the time that I’ve been at the club. So for me it is simple. Liverpool’s season will end against Stoke City this country as will the distinguished career of Steven Gerrard. Yet one thing that does not seem to be ending soon is this speculation over the future of Raheem Sterling. Expect that to run and run. Andy Murray has a tough route to the French Open final, he’s on the same side of the draw as Rafael Nadal. And Novak Djokovic and is likely to play one of them in the semi-finals if he makes it that far at Roland Garros. Andy Murray doesn’t know who he’ll be playing in the first round yet. He’s been drawn to face a qualifier. Britain’s Heather Watson will play the French wild card Mathilde johansson. The tournament starts on Sunday. England Rugby League’s head coach Steve McNamara says Sam Burgess’s best position is at flanker for the Rugby Union team. Burgess switched codes six months ago and has settled into that position at his club, Bath. He was called up to the England World Cup training squad this week, and they would prefer him to play at centre. He is a world-class athlete, a world-class rugby player, is attempting to be a world-class rugby union player. He has taken himself out of his comfort zone and tried something that is very, very difficult, and I think he’s doing a good job. difficult, and I think he’s doing a goodjob. Regardless good job. Regardless of whether he makes the final 15, when it comes to Stuart Lancaster picking the team, whether he makes the not, you’ll have an influence on that group. Reading between the lines, knowing how Sam likes to be involved in games, knowing how Sam likes to be involved in games committee needs to be nearer the action. I think the flanker position is the best position for him. The funeral is taking place today of the Welsh Rugby league International, Danny jones, the 29-year-old collapsed during a match for Keighley this month after a cardiac arrest as a result of a rare heart condition. 2000 people turned up to the service. It was in Halifax. A fundraising campaign has so far raised £150,000 to support his wife and his five-month-old twins. That is all from us. Thank you. Tomorrow night it’s the 60th Eurovision song contest. And it’s a milestone being marked by a one-off invitation to Australia to take part. 27 nations made it through to the final, with Sweden the favourite to win. But with so little UK success in recent years, why Do we still watch it, and what can we look forward to this year? Our entertainment correspondent Lizo Mzimba reports. Despite its lack of success in the 21st century, one of Eurovision’s most successful countries is the United Kingdom. It all started back in 1967 when a young singer asked a very important question. # I wonder if... # # One day that you’ll say that you care... # Sandie Shaw’s historic first win for Great Britain. # Like a puppet on a string. # Since the first contest and the first winner six decades ago, it has changed beyond all recognition, experiencing undoubted musical ups and downs and is becoming more and more of a balancing act between musical credibility and performances aimed at grabbing headlines, with credibility often the loser. Its popularity remains undiminished. Last year close to 200 million viewers across the globe saw Conchita Wurst win for Austria. The singer says the way the musical range of the contest has expanded over the years is a positive thing. It seems the whole world is a fan of Eurovision and it is so beautiful, because the concept is such an important and beautiful one because all the artists are allowed to come as they are, they can do whatever they want on stage. Performing in the final on Saturday alongside countries including the UK will be Australia, a special 60th anniversary one-off. And after the second semi-final last night, Sweden is also confirmed for the final. They are now considered by many to be one of the favourites to win on Saturday night. An earthquake of 4.2 magnitude hit parts of Kent last night. Local residents described being jolted awake by the tremor, which struckjust before three o’clock this morning. Police say they’ve been inundated with calls but there are no reports of any injuries or damage. There are on average 200 earthquakes in the UK every year, but ones of this magnitude are much more rare. A little like bank holidays Sunshine! Chris has the details. Nothing too earth-shattering in this bmmu Nothing too earth-shattering in this forecast for the bank holiday weekend. I’ll give you the details in a moment. Fortoday, a weekend. I’ll give you the details in a moment. For today, a lot of dry weather. A little bit cloudier than yesterday, but still bright and sunny spells for most areas. See the extent of the cloud on the satellite picture. The sunshine is coming across the cloud in the east, yet this cloud is big enough to bring a little rain to parts of Hampshire and west Sussex. It will probably cloud over in London. The far north of Scotland will seek increasing amounts of sunshine and generally for Scotland and Northern Ireland the clouds will thin little to allow brighter spells through. Temperature wise it will feel humid across the East with temperatures reasoning -- reaching 21 degrees. For the golf at Wentworth, it is looking good until Sunday when we are looking at a band of rain coming through. See highlights of the golf on BBC Two this weekend. This evening, the chance showers across the Midlands working through east Anglia and used before clearing away. A lot of cloud across England Wales and Northern Ireland, clearer skies in Scotland will move to the North of England, it will turn out to be a chilly night with a touch of frost on the grass. Weekend forecast, Saturday looks good with sunshine, yet on Sunday a band of rain will move south across Britain, this will clear out of the way and as we go into bank holiday Monday the weather will get better with bright or sunny spells for most. This is the weather chart for Saturday, high-pressure, the winds will stay right, the cloud will take awhile to break up across East Anglia &, eventually turning brighter. Later in the day we will see a band of rain pushing into the far north-west with temperatures that are reasonable, 16 for Belfast, 19 for London. Through Saturday night this band of rain pushes across Scotland and Northern Ireland bringing rain to England and Wales on Sunday afternoon eventually we will see sunshine following this cold front. With the colder air getting taxed in we will see temperatures below normal for this time of year -- temperatures below normal for this time of year -- tucked in. Much as they have been for most of the month. The bank holiday Monday the rain will clear, most every stride with sunshine, still feeling cool in the north-west, some isolated showers in the north-east. As bank holidays go, things are not looking too bad! Thank you. A reminder of the top story. David Cameron is meeting other European leaders and says he expects a lot of ups and downs as he makes his case for reform. Now it’s time for the news where you are. Good afternoon. Welcome to BBC London news. I’m Alex Bushill. Services run by London’s biggest NHS trust have been labelled 'inadequate’ by inspectors. Barts Health NHS Trust was placed in special measures in March. Now further inspections have revealed new concerns at the Royal London and Newham University hospitals. The health watchdog said there was a blame culture, staff shortages and unacceptable delays in treatment. Our health correspondent Karl Mercer reports. The staff at the Royal London and Newham hospitals have been labelled as caring and compassionate, but according to the Care Quality Commission, their hospitals are failing to give the best care. Once again, the country’s biggest health trust, Barts has found its hospitals labelled as inadequate charge. They all add up to the latest blow to hit Barts and its reputation. Lost the chief executive, the chairman, the chief nurse, your debt, and now two more of your hospitals have been rated inadequate. What message does that send to the people of East London? It sends a message that we’re not doing well enough. It does not say that our hospitals are not safe and you should not come to them. The COC say we must improve and we will, we ",,
152,BBC News 24,22-may-2015,BBC News at Six,18:00,30 mins,True,"David Cameron says he can negotiate EU reforms ahead of an in-out referendum, but it will take time and patience. He said there’d been no ""wall of love"" for him from leaders at an EU summit, but now he had a mandate from voters. I feel I’ve got the British people at my back, backing this approach. Let’s sort this out, let’s get this deal, let’s have this referendum and let the British people decide. We’ll be looking at how likely it is that David Cameron will achieve his aims.

The shock election moment when the Shadow Chancellor lost his seat. Tonight, he speaks exclusively to our political editor about his defeat. It wasn’t anger or tears. It was more just sort of dawning disappointment and a sense of loss. NHS trusts in England report a deficit that’s seven times higher than the previous year. And the kitsch, costumes and songs - Eurovision’s 60th contest. On BBC London: Failing to meet acceptable standards, a damning report into the UK’s largest NHS hospital trust. And an unexploded World War II bomb near Wembley Stadium is safely removed by the army. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. David Cameron has said he’s confident he can secure a better deal for the UK in Europe, but he admitted that it would take ""patience and tenacity"". Speaking at a summit in Latvia he said it was ""in everyone’s interests"" for there to be a deal, and said he’d ""scratched the surface"" of the issue with some leaders today. Mr Cameron is committed to renegotiating Britain’s relationship with Europe ahead of an in-out referendum by the end of 2017. james Landale reports from the Latvian capital, Riga. Britain has long been part of the European family, sometimes a distant relative, from a black sheep. But if David Cameron does not get the change that he wants, it could leave the family for good. Today, while Europe and the media focused on the Greek financial crisis, the prime minister began looking to allies for his planned reforms, which he knows will not be popular with some. There will be ups and downs. You will hear one day that something is possible, the next impossible. But one thing will be constant, my determination to deliver for the British will be constant, my determination to deliverfor the British people the reform of the European Union. So today he began sounding out leader after leader about the changes he wants, deterring EU migrants by cutting benefits, opting out of closer union, protecting the single market and giving national parliaments powers to block EU laws. And this frantic diplomacy will not end here. On Monday he will hold talks with the European Commission president at his country residence, and then he will go on a tour of European capitals to discuss his reforms before a summit injune where detailed negotiations may begin. If a deal is eventually done, there could be a referendum next year, or by the end of 2017 at the latest. Well, not today at least. British officials said the discussions were constructive and some EU leaders appeared in no mood to pick a fight with him, yet. If it is reform, excellent. If it is some kind of declaration whereby Britain is not involved in, say, ever deeper integration, that is fine. Then, when we come to the level of treaty change it might be more difficult. Not everyone was that keen to engage. Engage. TRANSLATIONZ engage. TRANSLATION: Europe is not yet interested in the referendum. If it happens, we will respond. The risk is ending up out on a limb, standing alone with not enough allies. Today, he dismissed any criticism at this summit is noise, but he admitted... I was not met with a wall of love when I arrived but there were people who were excited about our election results and congratulated me. There have been positive noises but are they not going to fight you every step of the way on the detail? It is not going to be easy. These are difficult problems. Britain and I am not happy with the prospect of ever closer union -- not happy with the prospect of ever closer union -- union, so let’s sort that out. I am not happy with the situation with regards to the scale of migration, the interaction between migration and welfare. Let’s sort it out. Is it possible? Of course. David Cameron has promised to push for reform in the months ahead, but his problem is that the tensions elsewhere on Greece and the migration crisis. He will have to fight to get his voice heard. But that might not be a bad thing. He might need a fight to convince people he has one real change. If not, Europe and Britain could be heading in different directions for good. jamesjoins us now from Riga. james, the start of a long process for David Cameron? Yes, the Prime Minister today said it was all about conversations, not negotiations. He and his fellow EU leaders will not get down to the nitty-gritty for some days, if not weeks, and if a deal is done it could take months or years. And then, if a deal is done, the Prime Minister will begin the 2nd phase of this process, selling the deal to his party and the public ahead of a referendum. So he is keen to get the process under way but as he said himself today, we should not expect it to be wrapped up in super-quick time. Thank you. One of the huge shocks of the General Election was the moment the then Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, one of the Labour party’s most prominent figures, lost his seat to the Conservative candidate. Today he’s spoken exclusively to our Political Editor Nick Robinson about that night, what went wrong for his party, and his plans for the future. We re Were you up for the Ed Balls moment? 18,776. The man thought he was on the brink of becoming Chancellor of the Exchequer now says this was a symbol of the the vibrancy of our democracy. He had onlyjust realised he had been fired by the electorate. I did not know I was going to lose mY I did not know I was going to lose my seat until the returning officer gave the result at 7:30am, so I had hours of uncertainty. I always knew that if the Tories won a majority at was probably a goner. Your emotion when you realised? Shock, anger, tears? I have been around a long time. So I have seen wrenching political change and I have seen people surprised by outcomes. It was not anger or tears, it was more a dawning disappointment and a sense of loss. It is two weeks to the day since he learned his fate. He is not yet ready to step back into Westminster, but is he ready to accept the blame for what went wrong for him and his party? Do you ever look at yourself and think, maybe Ed Balls was one of the reasons Labour was unelectable? Of course. Ed Miliband said he took full responsibility but all of us have to bear our share of the responsibility. He was the leader. I backed him as Shadow Chancellor, 100%. In the end, he did not persuade people he could be prime minister but I did not persuade people I could be the Chancellor either. We have to take it on the chin. Today, he is ready to identify one big mistake which Labour made and it is pretty clear who he blames. I wanted something more pro-business but I backed Ed Miliband 100%. He was the leader. But it was Ed Balls who was Gordon Brown’s key economic adviser in the run-up to the great crash. The question has long haunted him, did Labour spends too much in government and why did they take Britain into that crisis with a deficit and not a surplus? People will say that small deficit should have been a small surplus. The reality is that would have made a small difference, not a big difference. It could not have made the difference to the global financial crisis. In the end, we did not convince people of that, but those are the facts. There might be some who would look at you and say, even now he is not willing to learn. I think it is for me to think and reflect and for others to do so in the coming months. We can talk about these things, but everyday when you make a decision you have to go to bed at the end of the day thinking, that was the right call, because you will live with it for the rest of your life. His time in front line politics may be over but now might be his wife’s chance, one of the favourites to be Labour’s next leader. There lots of candidates, so presumably you struggling to think who to support! I will be supporting Yvette, of course. She is brilliant and people would have more of a chance to see what you stands for and what she can do. I will play no part in her campaign. It is her campaign and her ideas. I have the opportunity at the moment, time when there is other stuff going on in our lives and for our children, to stand back, and while she is busy, to do more to help the rest of the family. That is what I am going to do. In politics, you have two take your calling when it comes, and that is what she is doing. This is the moment for her? Yes. But what of his future? Since he was a student, Ed Balls has had politics in his blood, so is he going to walk away from it now? Neversay so is he going to walk away from it now? Never say never, but for me it is a new chapter, outside of politics. No by-elections, not back in Parliament, that is how it feels. Never, alljust until the next election? Outside of politics is where I am going next. That sounds awfully like a man still dreaming of another Ed Balls moment, but this time a winning one. Scotland’s First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has said the former Liberal Democrat minister Alistair Carmichael should consider his position as an MP, after he admitted leaking a memo during the election campaign. The leak suggested that Ms Sturgeon wanted David Cameron rather than Ed Miliband to win. Mr Carmichael has accepted the details of the leak were ""not correct"". Ms Sturgeon said it had been a ""blatant election dirty trick."" james Cook reports. Alistair Carmichael and his special adviser. The two men hatched a plan to damage the SNP by leaking a civil service memo to the press. Now they have been found out. The leak led to this front-page alleging that Nicola Sturgeon had told the French ambassador that she would prefer David Cameron as prime minister. Mr Carmichael now admits the story was not true. It was something I could have stopped and very much should have stopped. It was an error of judgement and I deeply regret it, and for the consequences of that error ofjudgement I have apologised to the First Minister and the French ambassador. If I were still a cabinet minister I would tender my resignation. The First Minister accepted the apology but is still not happy. She toured the studios to mY not happy. She toured the studios to my pointing out that Alistair Carmichael had changed his tune. He denied any knowledge of it and sought to cover it up during the election and is only now confessing because he has effectively been caught and found out. So his voters did not really vote in possession of the facts. He has to reflect on whether it is his constituents he really owes an apology. An apology or a resignation? really owes an apology. An apology ora resignation? Ithink really owes an apology. An apology or a resignation? I think he has to consider his position. When the memo was leaked, Scotland was gripped by election fever with the polls suggesting the SNP were surging to victory. It did not seem to make any difference. Only one Lib Dem end he was left standing, Alistair Carmichael. I give public notice that Alistair Carmichael is duly elected... So he clung on as an MP but his reputation is now tarnished, the damage done not by the leak, by Tash macro but by the lie. A former London taxi driver, who killed an American soldier in Iraq with an roadside bomb, has beenjailed for life. Anis Sardar was told it will be 38 years before he’ll be considered for parole. He’s the first person convicted in a UK court of involvement in the Iraqi insurgency. Sardar was yesterday found guilty of murder and conspiracy to murder. NHS trusts in England have reported a total deficit of more than £800 million for the financial year which hasjust ended. That compares with a shortfall of £115 million in the previous year. A big rise in spending on agency nurses has contributed to the deficit. Here’s Hugh Pym. It is another busy day for most hospitals. Ambulance... This one in Surrey, recently rated outstanding by regulators, is no exception. Patient numbers and costs are rising and that is putting pressure on finances. We see a constant increase across major specialities in demand for patient access, both for emergency work and some of our elective work. So we have had to work hard to ensure that we can respond to that. This hospital successfully balanced its books last year. Many others slumped into the red. If you take all the trusts in the NHS in England, including hospitals, Ambulance Services and community health, there was a deficit of £115 million in 2013-2014. Last year, there was a"" to 822 million. One reason was rising staff costs. 980 million was spent on agency nursing staff, up 150% over two years, according to the Royal College of Nursing. Demands for higher numbers of nurses after recent patient scare candle Basham Chris Campbell ‘s has come at a time of staff shortages, which is why hospitals have had to spend more on agency nurses. It is an eye watering increase in the spend, in response to not having enough nurses in the first place, having not trained enough and having cut nursing places when finances were tough. When NHS Trusts in England are in the red, the Department of Health tops up the system from its reserves and surpluses in other parts of the service, but with finances set to worsen again this year, analysts say the task will be harder. Deficits are rising, surpluses are shrinking. Even if the department managed to balance the books in 2014, it is looking difficult in 2015, meaning we need extra money from the Treasury. A government spokesperson said, we know the NHS is busier than ever and trusts are facing challenges, but we expect them to live within their means. Patients will hope that does not mean having to wait longer for treatment. Our top story this evening: David Cameron says he can negotiate EU reforms ahead Later on BBC London: A Wembley Stadium showdown for two of our clubs - battling for the prize of promotion. And, Carry On performing - jim Dale takes to the West End stage in a production about his 60 years in showbiz. And we are live at Scotstoun for the rugby Pro 12 final. Police say they have prevented a 16-year-old girl from east London from travelling to Syria to join so-called Islamic State. Scotland Yard acted on information given to them by a newspaper, which had been investigating the girl’s sister- a known recruiter for IS. Here’s our Home Affairs Correspondent Daniel Sandford. For around a year now, school-aged British girls have been being enticed out to join the self--styled Islamic State so the Daily Mail set up a fake online identity of a 16-year-old from London and within weeks, she was put in touch with an older British woman, already out in Syria. Soon, the 21-year-old was giving detailed instructions on social media. The recruiter told the two girls to meet at this smoothie bar and to use wifi to book an easyjet flight to Switzerland during the half-term holidays. She told them only when in Switzerland to book the onward flight to Is ban bull and from there to take a coach to the Syrian border. -- Istanbul. It had echos from the journey made by three girls from Bethnal Green during the February half-term. As we approach the half-term. It is a good time for parents and mothers to talk to their children and to their daughters to have a dialogue, to have a conversation about Syria and about this issue, because we are seeing, within Muslim families, we are seeing young girls, young Muslim girls being enticed by Islamic - so-kauld Islamic State out to Syria. Groups who work with parents, who are worried about their daughters, say Islamic State recruiters deliberately target young girls who feel disconnected from society or who are angry about Syria. They believe that ISIS provides them with this sense of belonging, it makes them feel part of a community that actually we know is not the case but they are lured into and drawn into that narrative. The recruiters in Syria and the teenagers they target in Britain use smartphone apps like wwicke, kick, sure snap and telegram which the Security Services cannot monitor. So there is a worry that young girls, who plan it marry Islamic State fighters will slip out of the country into into the war in Syria. Militants from so-called Islamic State are reported to have seized the last border crossing between Syria and Iraq. The group already controls large swathes of territory on either side of the border. IS fighters appear to have made more progress against Iraqi government forces, as they push on from the city of Ramadi, which isjust 70 miles from the capital, Baghdad. Our World Affairs Editor, john Simpson, is in Baghdad. How worried are the people you have been speaking to there? I don’t think worry is the word. They are depressed about the news. They thought - and depressed about the news. They thought- and when I say ""they"" I mean ordinary people as well as, you know, Western diplomats and Iraqi generals and so on. I have been talking to all sorts of people like that. They had thought that the tide had turned and they were pushing IS back. But any idea that there is somehow columns of Islamic State fighters going to pour down the roads to Baghdad or something like that, thatjust isn’t the way it is working. I mean, there are small groups here and there. Fallujah, one of the worst things there is the small number, relatively small number of IS people there and yet they hold it and the government can’t do anything about it. As for Ramadi, 2,000 Iraqi soldiers were beaten off and chased out by only 200 of the Islamic State fighters. So, nevertheless, it isn’t as fierce as a kind of major defeat for the government. Thank you very much. A rape victim has received an apology and £20,000 from Hampshire Police, after they accused her of lying about the attack. Two months after making her complaint, the woman was arrested on suspicion of perverting the course ofjustice, and she tried to kill herself.

She was disorientated. She was stressed. Crying. It bit wobbly. In shock. The police officers came. There was one female, one male. They weren’t very sympathetic. They later discovered that officers hadn’t tested the T-shirt properly from. Early on in the investigation, detectives decided Laura was lying. They started to investigate her for perverting the course ofjustice. I was horrified. You know, a woman comes forward and tells the police authorities she has been raped, you expect them to do everything they can to put the rapist away. Two months after the rape at her local police station in Winchester, Laura, a 17-year-old with a mental health problems, was arrested. She started self-harming again. She had attempted twice on her life because she couldn’t cope. It was six months after the rape, when the T-shirt had finally been tested properly, that the teenager was told she was in the clear. Her rapist was charged and convicted. Hampshire Police is now apologising for letting down Laura from the start. I don’t think we put the victim at the centre of our investigation. When this happened, I don’t think we conducted an investigation with any rigour, with enough detail, with enough oversight. Crucially, Ithink enough detail, with enough oversight. Crucially, I think some empathy and compassion was missing. In recent years, police leaders and prosecutors have focussed on the need to listen to victims. jackie is now reflecting on the behaviour of her local force. now reflecting on the behaviour of her localforce.

Most of us will miss the showers but across some southern parts of England and Wales, one or two isolated showers. They will fade away overnight but we keep a lot of cloud across the southern half of the country in particular, so fairly mild here with temperatures generally well in double figures, whereas further north, clearer skies pushing in so a chilly start to the day across parts of Scotland and northern England. Perhaps a touch of frost first thing Saturday but Saturday is shaping up to be a fine day across the country. We are looking at sunny spells, by Sunday, cloud and outbreaks of rain pushing south. Then a return to sunshine but fresher conditions for bank holiday Monday. So to look at Saturday in more detail, we will keep a bit of cloud across southern and south-eastern areas. That will slowly tend to thin and break allowing sunny spells but for most places, dry and bright and with light winds it should feel pleasant with temperatures in the mid-to high teens, we could see 20 degrees in the south-east this.

We do not know yet. The NHS has a large deficit. We have done research that says the London is around the 300 million pound mark. There is a real issue in the capital. Barts NHS Trust has a deficit of £75 million this year. They have real problems. Another issue today that was mentioned was the cost of agency staff, which is something we are familiar in London. We did a Freedom of information request to the London hospital trusts and we found a £1+00 million bill for agency staff. That is because hospitals cannot find staff in this country. There are not enough people coming out of colleges and not enough trained staff. We know that hospitals are looking to Spain, Portugaland Ireland. The London and on services recruiting industry earlier. That gives you an idea where they are in terms of agency. Many of the chief executives I have spoken to say that they expect this year to be the most difficult they have ever faced. Thank you. An unexploded Second World War bomb discovered by builders near Wembley Stadium has been removed from the site to be made safe. The hundreds of residents and businesses evacuated after the discovery yesterday are now able to return to their properties. Alpa Patel has more on this and is in Wembley this evening. That World War II bomb threatened to overshadow a big weekend of sport at Wembley Stadium and cultish option to hundreds of people living and working here. The armed forces say it that it posed a genuine risk to life but it has now been removed and escorted out of the alia. Here is how the day unfolded. The heart of Wembley was at a standstill today. There was a Gordon in place that was preventing people getting home, to work or to college. There was an unexploded World War II bomb. This team are used to diffusing these devices. It was found around 400 yards away from here. Bomb disposal teams were there through the night trying to make it secure. One official told me that they thought about conducting a controlled explosion last night, but then they decided to take it to an undisclosed location and explode it there. More than 300 homes were evacuated. This couple returned home last night to find that they would be spending it at this community centre. We got inflatable bed and you put them down for you wanted and tried to sleep. It was not the greatest night of sleep, I have not slept. There was an old lady with me who was quite scared about when she would get home. I tried to comfort her because she was very scared. She was in her 70s. I made sure that she slept next to be and it took care of her all night. The bomb was dropped during the Nathalie bombing raids in the early 1940s and as construction brings more of these bombs are being found. -- the NATFHE bombing. Full as far as the military is concerned a special thanks to them. It has been a pressurised situation and it has got a fantastic outcome now. Wembley is returning to normality and there will be football this weekend. Wembley is now return to normal. The disruption is over and there will be no knock-on effects to the big weekend in football. For the workers that this construction site, they can return back to work. The Ministry of Defence have told us that the bomb has now been detonated bringing an end to a frustrating day for people here. I spoke to a police officer who said that there are more of these bombs across London, so you have not seen the end to operations like this in London. A ninth person has been charged in connection with the Hatton Garden burglary. The contents of 56 safe deposit boxes were taken during the raid in London’s jewellery district over the Easter weekend. It’s believed jewellery worth up to £200 million was stolen. An international police hunt is underway for a man and his wife, after naming them as wanted for a shooting in Islington three years ago. Patrick and Constance Adams, both in their fifties, are believed to have fled the country soon after the shooting. It is thought they-could-be living in Holland or Spain. European arrest warrants have been issued for them both. The Education Secretary, Nicky Morgan, has defended the Government’s pre-election pledge to open more free schools. Many of them are planned for London. Critics say the schools, which are outside of local council control, are a waste of public money because there’s no evidence they lead to greater academic success. Here’s our education reporter, Marc Ashdown. Countdown to a new school, or so they hope. This federation of primary schools is applying to open a new free school secondary school. Parents are on board, but the collaboration with existing schools as vital. It is an enormous undertaking and once you start looking at that application and seeing what is involved in a secondary school, it is way beyond the curriculum, you realise the kind of skill and expertise that you need for that. The parents who are involved in the process can influence the shape of the school and what we want for our own children and what we see around asked. That is building on a cell at the exact building are solid bedrock of educational experience. This is the government delivering on David Cameron’s pledge to open 500 more Free Schools. Many of these are in London. In the latest wave of 49 Free Schools to open, 46 are in London. But only a couple of those can claim to be parent led. Who else is applying to open schools? It is a mixture of charities, religious establishments, and other organisations. The appetite for applications remain strong and we would like parents to come forward. We are seeing parents working with other organisations who may have more educational experience. We are seeing schools collaborating and wanting to set up new Free Schools. We see high standards in London and we want to see more of those. So far in London three quarters of the Free Schools inspected had been rated very highly. However, it is not a fair comparison with neighbouring schools. The national union of teachers insist they are a waste of money. As many of them are in difficulty as are doing a good job. Over one third of them have opened in places where there was no need for school places. There are Free Schools that are doing well and there are Free Schools that are not doing well. The issue is the quality of teaching. There is an attainment 9aP of teaching. There is an attainment gap where children from disadvantaged backgrounds are only half as likely to get the grades at the end of secondary school. We need to develop our teachers. There is another five years of Free Schools to come, by which time the debate over the effectiveness may have been settled. Still to come tonight: The Bank Holiday weekend weather, and Carry On performing- jim Dale takes to the West End stage in a production about his 60 years in showbiz. It looks and feels like any other open-air swimming pool, except this one is a piece of public art in the heart of Kings Cross. The freshwater pool, which has no chlorine in it, is kept clean with the use of aquatic plants and grasses - as our environment correspondent, Tom Edwards, has been finding out. In among the building sites and railway lines, an unusual addition. Man made and chemical free and today quite cold this is King’s Cross Polland. It is a great idea. This is a natural pond where people can just swim and enjoy nature. It gives you an urban outdoor experience. It is about connecting with nature. People like being outdoors. When you are swimming you can really feel it. You can go for a run in the park but you are not connecting with everything. You get in the water here and it is fresh. It is a pleasant experience. It is part art installation and part environmental projects. Only 165 swimmers a day can come in. Half of the pool is taken up with plants and the water circulates through them to purify it. This is a PR gimmick. The developers do not mind the PR, but this is a development they gave so they could rebuild the area. It is a juxtaposition between a place to relax in the middle of a busy developing space. This is all built UP developing space. This is all built up to two metres high so people can see what is happening around them. It cost £6 50 a swim. It will be there for two years and then it will be turned into a park. If it is popular it could become popular. -- it could become permanent. Time for the sports now, and Sara Orchard is here with more reassurance for football fans. Yes, thank you Riz. As we’ve been hearing, the Football League say this weekend’s play-off finals will go ahead despite the discovery of an unexploded World War II bomb close to Wembley Stadium. Relief for fans of both Wycombe and Southend, who clash at the home of football in the League Two play-off final tomorrow. Only one team will take home the prize of promotion to League One - it’s the Chair Boys versus the Shrimpers. Chris Slegg has more. Southend United are going to Wembley! Will it be Southend or Wycombe? For one the joy that greeted reaching Wembley will be magnified tomorrow, for the other another season of toil in the basement division awaits. It is 21 years since Wycombe were last at Wembley. Their manager, Gareth Ainsworth, played against them that day for Preston, who Wycombe beat. I’lljust be telling my players to enjoy the occasion, make sure that they are involved in everything building up to Wembley and just don’t let the game pass you by. Going up to League 1 is also a status thing, so when we want to attract new players, when we want to get loans, when we want to do deals with clubs being in League 1 is important. For Wycombe’s longest serving player, Matt Bloomfield, it will be a day to treasure. Have you tried your suit on yet? Yes, we tried them on earlier in the week. Wejust got them now, so I’ll take that home and try it on and make sure it all fits all right. This is a lovely build-up. There is a great feeling around the club. The supporters are all excited with the anticipation of going back to Wembley after so long. This time last year, Wycombe fans were celebrating staying up. Now Wembley awaits. We are proud of what we have achieved this year, after where we came from last year. Nobody is sleeping, nobody can believe it. The sense of occasion is wonderful. You just have to enjoy it. Southend have more recent Wembley memories, but not good ones. They lost to Crewe two years ago. They hope it will be different under Phil Brown, a manager with Premier League pedigree. You realise the enormity of it all when you get to Wembley. You have 48 games to get there and it is not like a semifinal or a final, you have got 48 games to get there. Southend have got a celebrity fan among their ranks - newly crowned World Snooker champion, Stuart Bingham. Hopefully I’m going to be their lucky charm again and the boys can do a result. He will hope that winning is contagious, Wycombe will have other ideas. Well, it’s also the last day of the Premier League season on Sunday-when Chelsea will be presented with the trophy. Plans are well underway for an open-top bus parade for the Blues on Bank Holiday Monday, so if you are in South West London on the 25th, the parade will start at 12noon and finish at 1pm. The buses will depart from Stamford Bridge before travelling east along Fulham Road, Hortensia Road, King’s Road and New King’s Road before stopping at Eel Brook Common. Roads are closed from 7.30am, but should reopen to traffic from 4.30pm. A slightly different story for West Ham manager Sam Allardyce, who’s announced that his future as manager at the club will be decided on Monday after talks between the club and his agent. The Hammers are currently 11th in the Premier League and face his former club Newcastle on Sunday. Whilst the North-East side are battling to avoid relegation, Allardyce continues to face criticism from some supporters who want him replaced. My agent will be available to speak to the owners because at this moment in time, because the season has finished so late, I take the only opportunity I have to spend time with my grandchildren - which is half term. So I’ll be shooting off to Spain to see them and what ever will be will be. Saracens Rugby Club are away to Northampton Saints in the semi-finals of the Aviva Premiership tomorrow afternoon. The North Londoners were beaten by Saints in extra time of last year’s final, but the game comes after the club was boosted by the news that England head-coach Stuart Lancaster named ten Sarries players in his 50-man World Cup training squad this summer. And ahead of basketball’s European Championships in Hungary next month, Great Britain’s Azania Stewart from Camden broke down in tears as she talked about the future for the sport in the UK. The 26-year-old Olympian believes the women’s game will become virtually ""extinct"" in the United Kingdom if gigabits don’t finish in the top six at the Championships to secure their future funding. -- GB I have worked so hard throughout my career and I guess what made me really upset was realising if we don’t achieve our goals it will all be burnt to the ground and I will never play for my country again. You can hear more of that interview tomorrow on Saturday Sportday on BBC1 at 12.50pm. That’s all the sport. Back to you, Riz. To something completely different now. He’s perhaps best known for his work in the Carry On films. But after being in show business for more than six decades, including working with Sir Lawrence Olivier, jim Dale has collected some good tales to tell. He even wrote them down for his grandchildren. Now, he’s sharing those stories in a one-man show on the London stage. Wendy Hurrell has been to meet him. Oh, I am terribly sorry, Matron. Vintage jim Dale as Doctor Nookey in Carry On Doctor. Never mind, you can still use it on people who are a bit round the bend. Now he is on the London stage in justjim Dale, a one-man show about what happened in the half century after music hall and Carry On. In his 80th year, he is back from his home in the States where he has already put on the show. Coming back to England, I get lynched if I don’t mention Carry On, so, yes, they are putting in special material that I have just rewritten. The stories are true, they all happened and it should be a right old giggle. It is not as though I bumped into her on purpose. I stepped off the plane and the first person I met said ""hello, Dr Nookey"". I don’t experience this in New York, not this recognition, which is purely from the Carry On films. There is only Barbara Windsor and myself of the original team left. And Babs has promised to be there on opening night at the theatre on maybe 26th, a stage she knows well. -- May 26th I think my initials are still on the wall from 50 years ago when I was here. He worked in the National Theatre in the 70s with luminaries like Anthony Hopkins at the request of Laurence Olivier. Every part that I have chosen has been very carefully selected to create that magical moment when you do it with the best people, the best director, the best writers. That is the only way you can give your best performance and it has happened so many times, I have been so lucky. He will carry on acting, writing, singing and making us laugh - adding all the time to his illustrious 65 years in show business. Thisjustjim Dale is the peak. What else could I do other than star in the West End in a one-man show, from sitting in the audience watching musical when I was seven and wanting to be a part of it. This is the pinnacle. Let’s get a check on the weather for the Bank Holiday weekend with Chris Fawkes. The weather is still OK. It has been largely dry but with some more cloud. There were some glimpses of sunshine. Temperatures reached 20 Celsius around London. It is going to stay fine over the next couple of hours. It will be quite mild. Most of us will have a dry evening. Then cloud will move then overnight and it might be thick enough by morning to give us a little bit of rain. In mild night at 13-14 Celsius. Tomorrow we are looking at a cloudy start to the day, but things will improve. The sunshine will arrive in the second half of the day. There could be some rain in Kent and Essex, but they will clear the way. -- it will clear way. Essex, but they will clear the way. -- it will clearway. It -- it will clear way. It will be fresh in the centre of town as the winds come up the Thames. On Monday it should be dry with sunny spells. On Sunday there is low pressure pushing this weather front into an alia of high pressure. Sunday will start off bright, but it will cloud over to Sunday afternoon and there will probably be some rain. There could be some aliens that miss it all together. Before the rain arrives it will be 19 Celsius. On bank holiday Monday we will be back to dry and bright weather. However, the wind will bring colder weather. Temperatures will reach around 16 Celsius. So as a reminder, the next few days will not be bad but there may be rain on Sunday. Thanks very much. The main headlines: David Cameron says he’s confident of being able to secure the reforms he wants to see in Britain’s relationship with the European Union. The Prime Minister is attending an EU leaders summit in Riga. A rape victim has received an apology and £20,000 from Hampshire Police, after they accused her of lying about her attack. A man was later convicted of rape and jailed. Police say they’ve prevented a 16-year-old girl from East London from travelling to Syria to join IS. They acted on information from a newspaper, which had been investigating the girl’s sister- a known recruiter. The Royal London and Newham General hospitals have been told they’re failing to meet acceptable standards in patient care and safety. Both are run by Barts NHS Trust- which was put into special measures earlier this year. And, an unexploded Second World War bomb unearthed by builders near Wembley Stadium has been safely removed. 300 homes and a television studio had to be evacuated after its discovery yesterday afternoon. That’s it, thanks forjoining us. Plenty more on our website and Asad Ahmad will be back with our late news. From me and all the team here, have a lovely Bank Holiday weekend.

154,BBC1 London,22-may-2015,BBC News at Ten,22:00,25 mins,True,"David Cameron says he can negotiate EU reforms, ahead of an in-out referendum, but it will take time and patience. He said there’d been no ""wall of love"" for him from leaders at an EU summit- but now he had a mandate from voters. I feel I’ve got the British people at my back, backing this approach. Let’s sort this out, let’s get this deal, let’s have this referendum and let the British people decide. We’ll be looking at how likely it is that David Cameron will achieve his aims. Also tonight: Nicola Sturgeon condemns a "" blatant election dirty trick"" - as a former Lib Dem minister admits being behind a leak during the campaign. As militants from Islamic State continue their advance across Syria and Iraq, questions about the strategy to defeat them. The shock election moment when the Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls lost his seat. Tonight, he speaks exclusively to our political editor about his defeat. There wasn’t anger or tears, it was morejust a dawning disappointment and a sort of sense of loss. And from ball gowns and ballads... to campness and kitsch - it’s time for Eurovision’s 60th contest. Tonight on BBC London: The undercover sting that stopped another teenage girl from east London travelling to Syria tojoin IS militants. And two more hospitals in the same NHS Trust are judged to be ""inadequate"". Good evening. David Cameron has said he’s confident he can secure a better deal for the UK in Europe - but he admitted that it would take ""patience and tenacity"". Speaking at a summit in Latvia, he said it was ""in everyone’s interests"" for there to be a deal, and said he’d ""scratched the surface"" of the issue with some leaders today. Mr Cameron is committed to renegotiating Britain’s relationship with Europe - ahead of an in-out referendum by the end of 2017. Our deputy political editor james Landale reports now from the Latvian capital, Riga. Britain has often stood alone in the European family, keeping its partners at arms length, but if David Cameron doesn’t persuade them of the changes he wants, it could leave the family for good. So today, while all eyes were on the Greek financial crisis, the Prime Minister slipped into the summit looking for allies for his planned reforms. There will be ups and downs. You will hear one day this is possible, the next day something else is impossible. But one thing throughout all of this will be constant and that is my determination to deliverfor the British people a reform of the European Union. So he began sounding out leader after leader about the changes he wants, deterring EU migrants by cutting benefits, opting Britain out of an ever closer union, and giving national parliaments new powers to block EU laws. Are we on the other side? Well, for once he wasn’t. British officials said discussions were constructive and some EU leaders appeared in no mood to pick a fight with Mr Cameron. At least, not yet. If it’s reform I think that’s excellent. If it’s some kind of declaration whereby Britain is not involved in say ever deeper integration, that’s fine. Then when we come to the level of treaty change, it might be a little bit more difficult. Not everyone here was as keen to engage. TRANSLATION: Europe is not that interested in a referendum. If it happens then we’ll respond. The risk for the Prime Minister is ending up out on a limb, standing alone with not enough allies. Today, he dismissed any criticism at the summit as noise. But he admitted. .. I’m not going to say I was met with a wall of love when I arrived but there were lots of people very excited by our election result, and congratulated me. There were lots of positive noises from EU leaders today, but aren’t they going to fight you every step of the way on the detail? It’s not going to be easy. These are difficult problems we’re grappling with. Britain is not happy, I’m not happy with the concept of ever closer union. It’s not really what we joined or signed up for, so let’s sort that out. I’m not happy with the situation with regards to the scale of migration and the interaction between migration and welfare, let’s sort that out. Is it possible to do this? Yes, of course it is. David Cameron promised to push for reform at every summit like this in the months ahead. His problem is that Europe’s attention is elsewhere, on Greece, Ukraine and the migration crisis. He’s going to have to fight to get his voice heard. But that may be no bad thing. David Cameron might need a fight to convince people he has won real change. If not, Europe and Britain could be heading in different directions for good. We canjoinjames in Riga now. David Cameron’s sounding confident - but this is going to be a long process with an uncertain outcome. This is just the This isjust the beginning of a long period of what in the old days used to be called shuttle diplomacy. On Monday, the Prime Minister will see the European Commission president and later in the wiki will fly for a grand tour of European capitals, leading up to a big summit in Brussels next, when for the first time potentially his reforms will be discussed at an EU wide level. Potentially a deal could take months if not years. If a deal is achieved at the first half of the process. He would have to persuade his party and the country to back it ahead of the referendum. This is the beginning of a process, of a period of uncertainty. It has emerged tonight the Bank of England has been carrying out secret assessments of the potential economic consequences of Britain leaving the European Union. They’ll revealed a mistaken to the Guardian newspaper. It’s not surprising there are contingency plannings, but it brings it home that if David Cameron fails in this campaign that he began here today in Riga then potentially any few years’ Riga then potentially any few years’ time Britain could leave the European Union. The former Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael has admitted that he was behind a leak which suggested that Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wanted David Cameron to win the election. Mr Carmichael has apologised for leaking the memo to a national newspaper during the election campaign. Nicola Sturgeon called it a ""blatant dirty trick"" and said he should consider stepping down as an MP. Our Scotland correspondent james Cook reports. It was the height of the election campaign. Nicola Sturgeon and the Scottish National Party were riding high in the polls. They seemed unstoppable, on course to victory. And so the Scottish Secretary and his special adviser, Euan Roddin, hatched a plan. They leaked a civil service memo to the press, alleging that Ms Sturgeon had told the French ambassador she would prefer David Cameron as Prime Minister. At the time, Alistair Carmichael denied being involved. The first I became aware of this, and this is on public record, was when I received a phone call on Friday afternoon from a journalist making me aware of it. That was a lie, as he now admits. It was something I could have stopped, I very much should have stopped. That was an error ofjudgement on my part. I deeply regret it and for the consequences of that error ofjudgement I’ve apologised to the First Minister and to the French ambassador. If I were still a cabinet minister at this point I would tender my resignation. The First Minister has accepted the apology but is still not happy. She toured the studios tonight, saying her opponent had contested the election on false pretences. He denied any knowledge of it and sought to cover it up during the election, and is only now confessing because he’s effectively been caught and found out, so his voters didn’t really vote in possession of all the facts. I think he’s got to reflect on whether it’s his constituents that he really owes the apology too. An apology, or a resignation? I think you’ve got to consider his position. Whether or not he resigns Alistair Carmichael’s reputation has now been tarnished. The damage done, as so often in politics, not by the leak but by the lie. One of the huge shocks of the General Election was the moment the then Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, one of Labour’s most prominent figures, lost his seat. Today - in his first interview since the election - he’s spoken exclusively to our political editor Nick Robinson about that night, what went wrong for his party, and his plans for the future. Were you up for that Ed Balls moment? 18,776. The man who thought he was on the brink of becoming Chancellor of the Exchequer now says this was a symbol of the vibrancy of our democracy. He had onlyjust realised he had been fired by the electorate. I didn’t know that I was actually going to lose my seat until the returning officer gave us the result at 7:30am. So I had hours of uncertainty. I always knew if the Tories won a majority I was probably a goner. Your emotion when you realised that? Shock? Anger? Tears? No. I think I’ve been around a long time, so I’ve seen wrenching political change and people being surprised by outcomes. It wasn’t anger or tears, it was morejust a dawning disappointment, and a sense of loss. It is two weeks to the day since Ed Balls learnt his fate. He is not yet ready to step back into Westminster, but is he ready to accept the blame for what went wrong for him and his party? Do you have a look at yourself and think, ""Maybe Ed Balls was one of the reasons Labour was unelectable?"" Of course. Ed Miliband said straight after the election that he took full responsibility, but all of us have to bear our share of the responsibility. Ed was the leader. I backed him, as Shadow Chancellor, 100%. In the end, he didn’t persuade people he could be the Prime Minister but I didn’t persuade people I could be the Chancellor either. We have to take that on the chin. Today, he is ready to identifyjust one big mistake which Labour made, and it is pretty clear who he blames for it. I wanted us to be more pro-business. But I also backed Ed Miliband 100%. He was the leader. It was Balls, though, who was Gordon Brown’s key economic adviser in the run-up to the great crash. The question has long haunted him, did Labour spend too much in government, and why did they take Britain into that crisis with a deficit and not a surplus? People will now say that small deficit should have been a small surplus. The reality is that would have made a small difference, not a big difference. That couldn’t have made the difference to the global financial crisis. In the end, we didn’t convince people of that argument. But I’m afraid those are the facts. There might be some who look at you and say, ""Even now he is not willing to learn"". I think it’s for me to think and reflect and for others to do so in the coming months. We can talk about all of these things. If Ed Balls’ future looks a little different these days, so too does his wife’s. Yvette Cooper is now one of the favourites to be Labour’s next leader. There are a lot of candidates. Presumably you are struggling to think who to support. Well, I’m going to be supporting and voting for Yvette, of course. I think she’s brilliant and I think people will have a chance to see more of what she is, what she stands for and what she can do. I’m not going to play any part in her campaign. That’s her campaign and they are her ideas. I have the opportunity at the moment, as I said, a time when there is other stuff going on in our lives and for our children, to stand back while she is busy and do more to help the rest of the family. So that’s what I’m going to do. But in politics, you have to take your calling when it comes. And that is what she’s doing. This is the moment for her? Yes. What, though, of his future? Ever since he was a student, Ed Balls has had politics in his blood. So is he really going to walk away from it now? You never say never, but for me it is a new chapter, outside of politics, no by-elections. Out of politics, not back in Parliament. That is how it feels at the moment. Not back in Parliament ever, or not until the next election? As I said, you never say never, but outside of politics is where I’m going next. That sounds awfully like a man still dreaming of another Ed Balls moment, but this time a winning one. Nick Robinson, BBC News, the City of London. This week more than 40,000 people have been displaced from the key Iraqi town of Ramadi. As forces from the self-styled Islamic State attacked, the Iraqi army left the town, instead of defending it and its people. Now, as militants appear to be moving east from the city, pushing more displaced residents before them, Iraqis are asking why their army could not defend their town. john Simpson isjust 60 miles away in the capital, Baghdad. The immense flow of refugees out of Ramadi, which has continued all week, has finally been stopped. The Iraqi government, worried about the numbers flooding into Baghdad, and worried, too, that Islamic State fighters might infiltrate the crowds, has now closed off the bridge along the route. Ramadi fell because the Iraqi commander there lost his nerve. He had 2000 men, Islamic State only had 200, but they tricked him with some clever manoeuvring. He ordered his men to get out of the city fast, and they were only too glad to go. Thousands of ordinary people from Ramadi are paying the price. Refugee camps like these have been set up around Baghdad. This man has some shrewd observations about the way the Iraqi army performed in Ramadi. TRANSLATION: It is an Iraqi army but it’s not united. The soldiers are divided. They have different factions. Each one has its own flag. This was the main problem over there. Here in Baghdad, the main threat is from suicide bombers, and security is tight. There is absolutely no sense here that Islamic State is about to come charging down the road from the west and threaten Baghdad. But the collapse of Ramadi does clearly raise questions about the competence of the Iraqi army, and whether it has the leaders to carry out the job of beating Islamic State. A retired general, who is now a distinguished defence analyst, agrees that part of the problem is the quality of the army leadership. And he says IS are ideological fighters, so people who are really committed to combating that ideology have to be used against them. Can the army defeat IS alone? No. Pretty radical for a former army general. But the Ramadi crisis could have other effects. Britain and America tried to tiptoe away from Iraq. Now they and other Western countries may have to get more involved again, if IS is to be beaten. john Simpson, BBC News, Baghdad. The recent, dramatic gains by Islamic State fighters across Syria and Iraq have prompted fresh doubts over whether the coalition strategy to defeat them is working. The extremists now control half of Syria, and they’ve established branches in several Arab countries. Today, its supporters carried out the deadliest terrorist attack in Saudi Arabia in nearly a decade. Here’s Frank Gardner. Murder ina Murder in a mosque, carried out by the so-called Islamic State. This was the aftermath today of a suicide bomb targeting Saudi Arabia’s Shia minority, during Friday prayers. At least 20 were killed, dozens injured. Saudi Shia blame their own government, saying it tolerates those who call them heretics. Saudi Arabia denies this. The conflict with Islamic State is expanding across the region. You can see from the shaded areas where they have support or control. In Syria, they are now the most powerful rebel group, and in Iraq they have exploited Sunni grievances against the government to take more territory. Their attack today in Saudi Arabia, and another in Yemen, will further inflame sectarian tensions. Which is exactly what the jihadis are aiming for. A sectarian war, where all Sunnis unite behind them. US led air strikes cannot really change that dynamic. They have stopped IFS from overrunning Kurdish towns on the Turkish border, but airpower alone has limitations. -- they have stopped Islamic State. We have this ambition to use air power only, and then to a degree arm and train the Kurds and the Iraqi government. But the Iraqi army has been incapable of pushing back Islamic State without help from Shia militia, trained by Iran, and they are not welcome in Sunni areas. It is a conundrum that Islamic State continues to exploit. Frank Gardner, BBC News. A former London taxi driver, who killed an American soldier in Iraq with a roadside bomb, has beenjailed for life. Anis Sardar was told it will be 38 years before he’ll be considered for parole. He’s the first person convicted in a UK court of involvement in the Iraqi insurgency. There’s been a big increase in the deficit run up by NHS trusts in England, to more than £800 million. That’s a seven-fold rise on the previous year. A sharp rise in spending on agency nurses, along with more patients, has contributed to the overspend. A rape victim has received an apology and £20,000 from Hampshire Police, after they accused her of lying about the attack. Two months after making her complaint the woman, who was 17 at the time, was arrested on suspicion of perverting the course ofjustice. A man was later convicted of rape and jailed. Over the last week we’ve been reporting on the plight of Rohingya migrants from Myanmar, and Bangladeshis, stranded on boats owned by people smugglers in the Andaman Sea. The countries they were headed for were refusing to let them land. They include Thailand, where the discovery of mass graves and reports of holding camps of migrants set up by human traffickers have led to a crackdown on the trade by the authorities. jonathan Head reports now from Thailand on what happens to many of the migrants who are simply searching for a better life. The discovery of mass graves this month in the jungle camps were migrants had been held finally forced the Thai government to start shutting down human trafficking networks. They’ve known about this brutal trade for years. Six months ago we came across this group of traumatised men just after they’d been rescued. But they weren’t Rohingyas fleeing persecution in Myanmar, they were Bangladeshis seeking a better life. The business had become so profitable the smugglers were expanding their reach. It was a secret trade hidden in the rubber plantations of southern Thailand. A Rohingya boy showed me where he had been held for nine months while his captors demanded a huge ransom from his family, where he had been forced to sleep in the open, where he said he saw people being raped and killed. This young woman escaped from a different camp. We spoke to her in a safe house. TRANSLATION: I want to tell everyone back home, please don’t come here. If you come here you will end up in a terrible situation. This is worse than what you are escaping. The Thai military often promised to take action but its efforts were ineffective. This boat crew had to cover hundreds of miles of indented coastline. They rarely caught anyone. We know that boats have been dumping their human cargos right in this area. That’s why we are searching these mangrove swamps. The sheer size and forested nature of this coastline dwarf the very limited resources the Thai authorities are putting into this operation. We found that the trafficking business was drawing in Thais at all levels. This young man showed us where camps had been set up near his village. TRANSLATION: The whole community is involved in this business. Everybody knows about the camps. It is because of the money. The traffickers hire everyone. They hire people to keep watch at the camps, to carry food for the Rohingyas. They go around all the houses here hiring people. I found few Thai officials who were committed to stopping the human trade. This district chief was one, running his own volunteer roadblock to try to stop migrants being trucked south to Malaysia. Today, he’s no longer alone in his efforts. Eliminating this well entrenched business, though, requires the kind of political will we haven’t seen yet. jonathan Head, BBC News, southern Thailand. Cricket, and England struggled on day two of the first Test at Lords. They were quickly bowled out for a first innings total of 389. In reply, New Zealand’s opening batsmen rattled off 148 before losing their wickets in quick succession. The tourists then fought back, ending the day on 303-2. The 60th Eurovision Song Contest kicks off tomorrow in Vienna, home of last year’s winner, Conchita Wurst. Since it was established in the 1950s as a way to bring together war-torn Europe, the contest has evolved to become the surreal extravaganza that we know today. Lizo Mzimba has more. The first winner of the first contest could scarcely have imagined what it would go on to become. To some, Eurovision is an international symbol of tolerance. Last year’s winner, a bearded drag queen. Two others, it is simply a TV extravaganza. Abba aside, not many now see it as a contest to showcase outstanding musical talent. It is not hard to imagine the kind of thing they could be thinking of. In the 1950s it was highbrow with ballgowns and tuxedos. Now it is more publicly accessible but you still have an issue with credibility. Many winners do not go on to be big hits. Almost from the start, the UK has had a strong, affectionate, not always successful relationship with Eurovision. Still, wins from the likes of Sandy Shaw... Brotherhood of Man... And Buck’s Fizz have given Britain more victories than most, often thanks to their particular British charm. Others that have tried to replicate that appeal have not done so well. Scooch came close to bottom, and Gemini were at the bottom, scoring the dreaded nil points. This year’s UK entry, Electro Velvet, have certainly gone for a distinctive style. Right now, they are far from being favourites. If you focus on where you are going to come and the odds, it can distract you from the performance which is the most important thing. So all we can focus on is our bit, the performance, and that is what we are doing. We have put ourselves in our own little bubble, not communicating with the outside world, just making sure the performance is tiptop. They will be hoping they will be a British act remembered long after tomorrow, and for the right reasons. Lizo Mzimba, BBC News, Vienna. That’s all from us. Now the news where you are. Good evening, I’m Asad Ahmad. The Metropolitan Police says its prevented a 16-year-old girl from east London from travelling to Syria to possiblyjoin IS militants. Scotland Yard acted on information given to them by a newspaper, which had been investigating the girl’s sister. She’s a known recruiter for the extremists. Here’s the BBC’s home affairs correspondent, Daniel Sandford. For around a year now, school-aged British girls have been being enticed out tojoin the self-styled Islamic State. So the Daily Mail set up a fake online identity of a 16-year-old from London and within weeks she was put in touch with an older British woman already out in Syria. Soon, the 21-year-old was giving detailed instructions on social media. How old are you, she asked. You cannot come directly to Istanbul unless you wish to get arrested. I’m 16, the undercover reporter replied. There’s another sister the same age as you, you may come together so your alibi is stronger. Where do you know the other sister from, she was asked. She’s my blood sister, LOL. Have you packed, nothing Islamic at all, no Islamic books, no Koran, oh, and delete all pictures from your phone of yourself in hijab or niqab, make sure your phone is filled with games and random things. The recruiter told the two schoolgirls to meet at this smoothie bar in East London and to use the Wi-Fi to book an easyjet flight to Switzerland during the half term holidays. She told them only when they were in Switzerland should they book the onward flight to Istanbul and from there they should take a coach to the Syrian border. The proposed trip had echoes of the journey made by three girls from Bethnal Green, in the February half term. ",,

The proposed trip had echoes of the journey made by three girls from Bethnal Green, in the February half term. As we approach the half term it’s a good time for parents and mothers to talk to their children and to their daughters, to have a dialogue, to have a conversation, about Syria and about this issue because we are seeing within Muslim families, we are seeing young girls, young Muslim girls, being enticed by so-called Islamic State out to Syria. Groups who work with parents who are worried about their daughters say Islamic State recruiters deliberately target young girls who feel disconnected from society or who are angry about Syria. They believe that Isis provides them with this sense of belonging, makes them feel part of a community which actually we know is not the case, but they are lured and drawn into that narrative. The recruiters in Syria and the teenagers they target in Britain use smartphone apps like Wickr, Kik, Surespot and Telegram, apps which the security services struggle to monitor, so each school holiday there remains a worry that young girls with plans to marry Islamic State fighters will slip out of the country and into the war zone in Syria. An unexploded World War II bomb discovered on a building site near Wembley Stadium has been safely removed. Roads in the immediate area had been closed since yesterday - and businesses including the Britain’s Got Talent studio, were evacuated. This afternoon, the bomb was defused by Army experts. Police are hunting for a man, believed to be part of one of London’s most notorious crime families, in connection with an shooting in Islington. Patrick Adams - reported to be part of the infamous Adams family gang, is believed to have fled abroad with his wife, Constance. Detectives want to question them both about a 51-year-old man who was shot in the chest as he sat in his car three years ago. Two further hospitals have been added to the list of those judged as being ""inadequate"" in the same NHS Trust- Barts. It’s already in special measures after inspectors from the Care Quality Commission gave a damning review of another one of its hospitals in March. The Trust says it accepts the criticism. Here’s Karl Mercer. The staff at the Royal London and Newham Hospitals have been labelled as caring and compassionate, but according to the Care Quality Commission their hospitals are failing to give the best care. Once again, the country’s biggest health trust, Barts, has found its hospitals labelled as inadequate, despite the best efforts of staff. Today’s reports paint a difficult picture for managers at Barts Health. They say there were not always enough nursing and medical staff to ensure safe care, operations were often cancelled due to a lack of beds, many staff reported a culture of bullying and harassment, there was low morale, high levels of stress, even confusion about who was in charge. They do say though that staff were caring and compassionate, despite their problems with managers. They don’t feel they can speak up when things go wrong and they feel bullied on occasion and a lot of staff have told us that. There’s also an issue about the basic safety precautions that are not being implemented on a day by day basis to make sure that care is always provided in the safest possible way. The criticisms are strong ones of Barts Health. It’s the biggest trust in the country. It has more than 15,000 staff and serves more than 2 million people in the east of London. The trust itself was set up in 2012, joining Barts, the Royal London Whipps Cross and Newham, but today’s reports lay out serious concerns about management across the sites. They are concerns and we accept those concerns and we apologise for the failings the COC have identified and we are determined, I am determined, to put those right. They all add up to the latest blow to hit Barts and its reputation. Lost the chief exec, lost the chairman, the chief nurse, you are £75 million in debt, you are in special measures. Now two more of your hospitals have been rated inadequate. What sort of message does that send to the people of East London? It sends a message we are not doing well enough. It doesn’t send a message that our hospitals aren’t safe and you shouldn’t come to them. The COC say we have to improve and we will improve. We are planning, we are taking action, we’ve already taken action. Ourjob is to match how some of our best services do. That is a job they’ll have to do while also trying to save more than £100 million this year. That’s it for now from me, but let’s find out what the weather’s up to with Stav. Is it good news? It’s not that bad. Plenty of sunshine. A bit of a cloudy and today, after a fine day with sunshine. A week whether friend has pushed down.

An appeal by aid charities after the earthquake in Nepal has raised £33 million for the relief effort in just four days. It includes £5 million from the Government. One week on from the disaster, the Nepalese authorities have ruled out finding any more survivors beneath the rubble.

Reports from Iraq say Islamic State militants have killed up to 300 hostages from the Yazidi minority community in the north of the country. Sources say the victims died near the northern city of Mosul yesterday. It’s thought they are likely to have been prisoners since last summer. The crime writer Ruth Rendell has died at the age of 85.

A poster campaign featuring a slim model in a bikini for the diet supplement company Protein World, continues to cause outrage in London. Hundreds of protesters have gathered in their swimwear in Hyde Park demanding the posters are removed from underground stations. Emilia Papadopolos reports. This isn’t your average protest. But today hundreds of people gathered in Hyde Park because of this. An advert for a diet product featuring a slim model in a bikini asking, are you beach body ready? They’re projecting this almost unhealthy images of women. They’re obviously like creating an impression on I think young girls, as well. I have two young daughters so I really don’t want them to grow up in a world where, you know, their lives are ruled by body image. The fitness fashion and beauty industry are filled with images like these. What is it about this particular ad Mays made people so angry? This could be the advert that broke the feminists’ back. There are millions of adverts like this, but I think it was the implication of are you beach body ready as though this was a minimum standard? The campaign’s been removed and the Advertising Standards Authority has launched an investigation to establish whether the ad is socially irresponsible. Rebeak ka is a model and says the ad even made her feel uncomfortable. It’s because of the wording, I think it’s aggressive. When I saw it, the first time I saw it, itjarred. There’s something about beach body ready and weight loss that’s quite aggressive and I think that’s why you have seen a lot of this outpouring of frustration and anger at the adverts. Protein World, the company behind the ad, descliened to comment on the protest. It’s clear the campaign has caused anger amongst Londoners, anger that some would argue has created the type of exposure that advertisers dream of. Rio Ferdinand’s wife, Rebecca Ellisson, has died after a short battle with cancer. AIn an emotional statement the QPR defender said his soulmate died peacefully overnight at London’s Royal Marsden Hospital. His team mates at Queens Park Rangers wore black armbands as a sign of respect at their Premier League match against Liverpool today. An ancient graveyard for prostitutes who were denied a Christian burial is to be transformed into a garden for the public. The Crossbones Graveyard near Borough Market was earmarked for development but, asjim Wheble reports, it’ll now be an open space respecting the lives of those buried there. It’s a busy day at Crossbones with volunteers like Arthur putting in the hours to make the garden ready for the public. Getting a water pipe in here, given the nature of the ground. That’s because there are thought to be up to 15,000 people buried here. But for centuries this place had another identity, as the unconsecrated grave for many of London’s prostitutes. You look at Borough Market now and it’s a food lovers’ Borough Market now and it’s a food lovers’ paradise but for century this is part was where Londoners would come for a good time The behaviour was ironically authorised by the powerful residents of this ruined old Palace, a stone’s throw from the Borough. Here was the London residence of the all-powerful Bishop of win chester who controlled much of the land in this area and had the authority to grant licences for the sex workers, the prostitutes known as the Winchester geese, they were denied a Christian burial and were buried in a pauper’s graveyard. This was already a century’s old secret by Elizabethan times. But it was an historian who mentioned it in 1598. I have heard from ancient men of good credit these women were forbidden the rights of the Church and therefore there was a plot called the single woman’s Churchyard. Fast forward and this ",,

Marking the moment up on high as the country waits for a name. It’s a girl! It’s fantastic because every woman and every little girl loves a Princess. I have three girls and they’re all really excited that it’s a girl. The party leaders have been out election campaigning in key marginal seats on the last weekend before polling day. The best-selling crime writer Ruth Rendell, creator of Inspector Wexford, dies at the age of 85. And the face-off in Las Vegas, ahead of the richest fight in boxing history. Good evening. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are back home tonight in Kensington Palace after the birth of their baby girl in hospital this morning. She was born just after half past eight and emerged in the afternoon in her mother’s arms to pose for the photographers outside the hospital with Prince William. The newborn princess is fourth-in-line to the throne, behind her brother Prince George. Our Royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell is outside Kensington Palace. Yes, the family, which had been three and which now is four, together tonight at their London home here, Kensington Palace and for the sake of her mum and dad, one must hope that this newborn daughter is sleeping soundly tonight after what has been a pretty eventful day. It had taken barely 12 hours from the Duchess’s admittance at 6.00am to her departure with a new baby at 6.00pm. And here, on the same steps where her brother and her father had made their first appearances in public, was the Royal Family’s newest Princess, a baby scarcely ten hours old, the fourth in line to the throne, sleeping soundly in her mother’s arms. William and Catherine looked happy and relaxed, as you would expect, after a birth which, by all accounts, had gone smoothly, and which had been very much quicker than that of Prince George 21 months ago. The couple posed for photographs and to wave to the crowds but on a chilly evening there was no lingering to talk to the media as they did after the birth of George. After a few minutes they went back inside the hospital to say farewell. Two hours earlier, George had come to visit his new sister. William had brought him from home. He tried to walk but maybe it was all the noise and the sight of so many people, it was all a little too much. Dad was there and George was scooped up. And with a wave, on what is, believe it or not, is the first time we have seen him officially in public here in the United Kingdom since his birth nearly two years ago, George headed in to size up his new sibling. It’s a girl, it’s a girl! Wind back to this morning and from the town crier, who seized his moment outside the hospital, from the BT Tower decked out in what was supposed to be pink, from the Royal Navy sailors marking out the word ""sister"", and finally from the formal notice of birth placed on an easel on the forecourt of Buckingham Palace, the news had gone out that the Duchess of Cambridge had given birth to a daughter. The official statement from Kensington Palace had given the facts: The Queen, dressed in pink, naturally, was in Yorkshire soon after the announcement of the birth of her 5th great-grandchild. She and the rest of the Royal Family were said to be delighted. And back in London, outside St Mary’s Hospital where quite a few have been camping out for days waiting for this, it was time to celebrate. It’s a little Princess! It’s a girl! It’s a girl, and it’s fantastic. Because every woman and every little girl loves a Princess. You know, we think about Diana always wanted a girl, and it would be great if her name was Diana. The name is something for which we will have to wait but whether it’s Elizabeth or Victoria or whatever is her parents’ final choice, one thing we do know already, this newborn child will be a source of fascination for many for the remainder of her life. Party leaders have been out campaigning on the last weekend before next Thursday’s General Election. Ed Miliband accused the Conservatives of using the SNP to divert attention from their own record in Government. David Cameron said Mr Miliband would have to talk to the Scottish Nationalists in the event of a hung parliament. Ben Wright reports. It was a hindu temple for David Cameron. The Labour leader headed to Hastings. Nick Clegg campaigned in Sheffield. The visits and rallies are now non-stop. The vote, just five days away. Can I have a picture with you? Ed Miliband said the Conservatives were trying to pit England against Scotland by warning about the SNP’s post-election influence at Westminster. What this election really comes down to, is not a clash of two nations, but a clash of two ideas. I believe Britain only succeeds when working people succeed. The Tories believe the country succeeds when the richest and most powerful succeed. That is the election choice in the next five days. But it’s a different choice in Scotland. And today the SNP’s Nicola Sturgeon was swamped by supporters in Inverness. Labour has said no deal with the SNP. But the Conservatives insist the two parties would talk if there is a hung parliament and today David Cameron again warned about a tie-up. If you want to avoid that, because like me you worry about having the Government held to ransom by a bunch of people that don’t want our country to succeed, indeed they don’t want our country to exist, the answer is to vote Conservative because we are only 23 seats short of that overall majority Government. David Cameron and Ed Miliband are campaigning to win. But if neither pulls off an overall majority in parliament next weekend will be about secret talks, negotiations and deals as they try and persuade the smaller parties to back them because the key test for a new Government is whether it can command the confidence of the House of Commons. And the Lib Dems could again be key. The Liberal Democrats are not going to enter into any arrangements, any pacts, any deals with either the UK Independence Party or the SNP. On a campaign visit to Kent, Ukip’s Nigel Farage said he would have a conversation with the Tories if he gets an EU referendum, something the Conservatives have already promised. So, on they push, imploring, persuading, fighting for your vote. It’s a week since the deadly earthquake hit Nepal. The number of victims has now passed 6,800, and today the government ruled out finding any more survivors. The main focus now is on delivering aid to communities that remain cut off and beginning the momentous task of rebuilding a shattered country. Our South Asia correspondent justin Rowlatt reports from Kathmandu. This is the moment the massive earthquake struck Nepal. Ancient temples in the heart of Kathmandu crumble and fall. And Nepal is still clearing the wreckage, counting the cost of this disaster. The UN estimates eight million people need help. The destruction stretches out across the city, across the nation. Footage shot today shows just what a huge challenge reconstruction is going to be for one of the poorest countries in the world. It is incalculable at the moment. We are making an assessment of the situation, estimate of the situation. It would require tens and tens, billions of dollars. And 1,000 Europeans are still unaccounted for, most thought to have been trekking in the remote regions of this beautiful country. The hope is they’re alive but stranded by the quake. This plane flew in today with supplies from Britain. It left tonight with a very different cargo. Tourists caught up in this disaster. We were trekking when the earthquake happened. There were times when it was scary, feeling the different aftershocks and especially from a country we have never experienced earthquakes, you don’t really know what’s going to happen. They are flying home, but the people of Nepal can’t escape the destruction. The Nepalese Government has said it doesn’t expect to find any more survivors but this team says it won’t be stopping its search any time soon. Reports from Iraq say Islamic State militants have killed up to 300 hostages from the Yazidi minority community in the north of the country. Sources say the victims died near the northern city of Mosul yesterday. It’s thought they are likely to have been prisoners since last summer. The crime writer Ruth Rendell has died at the age of 85.

Football, and Celtic secured their fourth Scottish title in a row after rivals Aberdeen lost. In England, Bournemouth have confirmed their promotion to the Premier League as winners of the Football Championship. The south coast club beat Charlton 3-0 to secure the League title on the last day of the season, while Watford finished second and also go up.

Boxing, and in a few hours’ time, what’s been billed as the richest fight in history will take place in Las Vegas. The US boxer, Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao, from the Philippines, will share nearly £200 million in prize money. The weigh-in alone attracted a crowd of more than 11,000. Our sports editor Dan Roan is in Vegas. Well years in the making, this fight features arguably the two defining boxers of their generation. For many the sheer amount of money being generated is hard to believe, for others it’s a sign of the sport’s enduring appeal. One thing is certain, rarely before, if ever perhaps, has a sports event been accompanied by such a level of hype. All Mayweather and Pacquiao have to do now is live up to it. It was as if fight night had come early. How much of a relief is it the moment is here? Ifeel good, I have been here before. As they made their way into the arena for a weigh-in like no other, even they may have been surprised by the atmosphere. For the first time, this prefight ritual was a ticketed event with fans charged $10 to attend. That didn’t stop 11,000 of them from being here, such are the levels of interest in the so-called fight of the century. The hype has been built up so much for so long. To have these guys fighting after many years, this is it. It’s crazy. It’s the best ever. It’s a big deal. I am excited. Both boxers came in comfortably under the requireded -- Both boxers came in comfortably underthe requireded -- required weight and aftera underthe requireded -- required weight and after a week of hype the focus will now turn to tonight’s showdown. For mel focus will now turn to tonight’s showdown. For me I believe the fans deserve it. Tomorrow the fans deserve to have a good fight. Las Vegas is gearing up for one of the biggest sporting events of the year and many of the great of the boxing world are in town to witness it although for some the attention was a little too close for comfort. Everyone it seems has an opinion on the fight. Everything is up and up. Boxing is alive. Boxing is number one. We make more money than everybody. How big a moment is this? Biggest moment in the sport of boxing. It’s exciting. Meanwhile, in the Philippines the country is expected to come to a standstill as millions tune in to watch their national hero take on his unbeaten American rival. This is a very important fight for him and for the entire Philippines, for everyone. Never has boxing witnessed sceneses like this before the actual fight. The sport it seems still has the appeal to capture the world’s attention. Full commentary of that match will be on BBC Radio Five Live. Coverage starts at 3. 30am. Set your alarms. That’s it from us.

The outstanding coach of his generation, that is how England described Peter Moores a year ago. The ECB thought so much of him, they have appointed him twice and dismissed him twice. He is frustrated with the time he was given and the way he was sacked. The dressing room seemed with him. The results were mixed. England were awful at the World Cup earlier. Beaten by Bangladesh. Sent home early. Moores clearly carried some responsibility. The Test record was OK. But the World Cup was poor. The coach and the players have to take responsibility. But don’t look back, look forward. Peter is a very good man. It is his second go. It did not work out. A man has been hired by English cricket, Andrew Strauss, now appointed director. Well, bold decisions can pay off. But there will be sympathy for Moores, his exit seemed like an open secret. The Ashes two months away and it is transition time again for English cricket. Burnley have been relegated from the Premier League despite the 1-0 victory over Hull. A Danny Ings goal was not enough to prevent their return to the championship.

Good evening, I’m Asad Ahmad. One of the biggest transport issues facing the new Conservative Government in London this year, is over the expansion of airports. It was always said, that a decision would made after the election, when the Airports’ Commission delivered its recommendation. But now, it appears their final report could be delayed. Victoria Hollins reports. The decision on airport expansion was due after the election. It is now at the top of the agenda, partly because of this man. Borisjohnson. The new Uxbridge MP used his speech toissue The new Uxbridge MP used his speech to issue a war cry against a runway at Heathrow. I wool lie down with you in front of the bulldozers and stop the construction of that third runway. The Government will decide once the airport commission makes a recommendation injuly. There are three options on the radar. A third runway at Heathrow, extending a existing runway at Heathrow, or adding another runway at Gatwick. But the commission announced it is reopening the consultation to look at air quality in detail. Gatwick Airport said: It is significant that the first decision by the airport’s commission after the election is to consultant on the issue of air quality. Gatwick has never breached the legal air quality limits. Its locations means it never will. The commission acknowledged that expanded Heathrow would breach air quality limits. It said: The ran for the air quality exceeding levels north of the airport is road traffic on the MA. But it is notjust the pollution issue that could cause Heathrow problems. There are big beasts in the Tory Party, Borisjohnson, Zac Goldsmith, justine Greening are against a third runway at Heathrow. Many of them are prepared to make trouble. I therefore, think now that this is less likely to happen. The airport commission does not expect a delay to the final report, how the new government will use it is unclear. An innocent bystander has been shot in broad daylight in Bermondsey - after she got caught up in a street fight. Two men, one armed with a gun were fighting on Rotherhithe New Road yesterday afternoon, when the weapon fired, hitting a 38 year-old woman in the leg. She was taken to hospital, where the injuries were notjudged to be life-threatening. Police are appealing for witnesses. A day after the Labour leader, Ed Milliband resigned following his party’s election defeat, Tottenham MP, David Lammy is considering throwing his hat into the ring, to take-over. He said Labour had to move out of its comfort zone and show it wasn’t just the party of the ‘working class’. And he feels he might be the person to do exactly that. For people like me it is absolutely time to step up to a leadership role. Now I’ve been thinking carefully and indicating that I want to seek the Labour nomination for Lord Mayor but actually, in putting together that team, now that we have a proper race to lead the party, of course, me and others are looking carefully at who is the best leader and if colleagues come to me in the coming days to say, David... I will think about it. Of course. So, VE Day celebrations are being marked this weekend, and as well as the 19lIo’s themed concert taking place tonight at Horse Guards Parade, earlier, the bells rang out from St Paul’s Cathedral. They rang at 11 o’clock this morning joining church’s and cathedrals across Britain. The celebrations in 1945 were very much centered here in London. Tomorrow there’ll be a parade of ex-servicemen in Whitehall followed by a flypast of World War Two aircraft.

It has been a slowly improving weather story. The showers we had earlier are fading and the winds easing too. There is late sunshine to end the day and fairly light winds. The cloud is increasing from the west. Through this evening we see the cloud across Northern Ireland and Scotland bringing outbreaks of rain to northern and western parts of the country. To the south-west mostly dry. Cloud and hill fog, turning breezy in the west. In the west we have lighter winds, a chilly start for East Anglia. Up to northern Scotland a touch of frost. Tomorrow it is the Great Manchester Run. There is some cloud, a lot of dry weather and not so hot. Elsewhere, we have the rain initially, pushing from Northern Ireland to parts of Scotland, the far north of England. Cloudy conditions for western areas, the mist and hill fog holding on. Breezy in the west, heavy rain in Northern Ireland and Western Scotland. But for England and Wales, a good deal of sunshine for the central and eastern areas.

Scotland’s voice will be heard more loudly than ever before, says the SNP leader as she gathers her new MPs. Nicola Sturgeon tells the 56 MPs she is bursting with pride, and says fighting austerity will be their first priority. No longer will Scotland be sidelined or ignored in Westminster. Our voice will be heard, our interests will be protected. Back home with his family as Labour begins the long process of finding a new leader. 70 years after Russia’s victory over Nazi Germany, a military spectacle in Moscow. Many Western leaders stay away. And in London, more than 10,000 people gather on Horse Guards Parade for a star-studded concert to celebrate the 70th anniversary of VE Day. Good evening. The leader of the SNP Nicola Sturgeon has met with the party’s new MPs, promising to fight austerity in the Westminster Parliament and to represent the interests of all of Scotland. The Scottish Nationalists are now the third-largest party in Westminster. The party’s former leader, Alex Salmond, says the SNP’s landslide victory means Scotland is now closer to independence. Until Thursday, the SNP had just six MPs. just look at them now. A Tartan army of 56, heading south to shake UP army of 56, heading south to shake up Westminster. Some old hands, but many more fresh faces. Their leader was, she said, bursting with pride. Scotland has given the SNP a mandate on a scale unprecedented for any political party, notjust in Scotland, but right across the UK. It simply cannot be and it will not be business as usual when it comes to Westminster’s dealing with Scotland. For some SNP supporters, this moment means more than they can say. The next time Nicola Sturgeon’s MPs liner clad this will be on the green benches of the House of Commons, but what will they do their? What do they want? What effect will it have on the rest of the UK? A more powerful Scottish Parliament has already been promised by Westminster. In a -- Parliament has already been promised by Westminster. In a -- and emboldened SNP wants to go further, transfer ring business taxes, welfare payments, the minimum wage. Is Scotland closer to independence today? Yes, because the SNP has an overwhelming mandate for the Scottish people to comment-- overwhelming mandate for the Scottish people to comment -- to carry forward Scotland’s interest. Confidence is growing all the time. The timing of any future referendum is a matter for the Scottish people first and foremost. The matter of tactics is a question for Nicola Sturgeon. Some of the new intake are treading more carefully. Mary Black is getting used to her role as beginners to MPs and the 19th-century. Scotland is finding its confident. As we said, but this is about is recognising people have voted to be part of the union, so ourjob as representatives is to make sure that that system serves as as best as it possibly can. How the UK Government will respond to all of this is not yet clear. They may be in opposition, but it will be hard to ignore the SNP, who are now Britain’s third political party. 17 people have been arrested after anti-austerity protesters clashed with police in Westminster this afternoon. A police officer and a member of police staff were taken to hospital after being injured during the protest, which began outside Conservative headquarters and moved to the gates of Downing Street. The Conservatives have been celebrating their victory, but they now have the issues to address. Yes, and people will be appalled by those pictures. The government has big issues to tackle, it needs to find a spending cuts, and there is Scotland, the union under strain again. David Cameron said he wanted to be a one nation Prime Minister, he said Scotland will have new powers. Downing Street said it would not be full control over tax and spending. The issue of voting rights in Parliament for English and Welsh MPs is alive as well. The Prime Minister’s priority is assembling his new government. We have new names tonight. Nicky Morgan remains with education, Michael Gove moves to justice Secretary, with education, Michael Gove moves tojustice Secretary, Michael-- Mark Harper will be Chief Whip, Chris Grayling will be the leader of the House of Commons. Beyond the dreams of Conservatives just two days ago, they have a majority of 12. It could mean that getting business through might not always be easy. The Labour Party is spending the weekend reflecting on how they come back from a very heavy defeat. Calm has returned to Stevenage. This was a top Labour target, but it stayed blue. The voters sent David Cameron back to Downing Street. Labour could not be trusted, they were going to go with Scotland or anybody else, just so they got in. I do not think that Ed Miliband is a charismatic, strong leader. There was nothing there that said, this is what we will do to be able to fund that. I did not trust their policies. You did not trust them? No. Ed Miliband visited, but a former Labour Home Secretary said the party failed to understand people’s desire to do better. We are a party who created -- people’s desire to do better. We are a party who created -- alleviated poverty and part of that is aspiration. We have ceased to be the party of aspiration. Ed Miliband has gone, and soon there will be a contest for his replacement. Putting leaders could include Yvette Cooper, Andy Burnham, Chuka Umunna and Tristram Hunt. And a crop of less well-known names, perhaps Liz Kendall, Danjarvis and, not falling himself out today, David Lammy. Their problem is notjust a question of personality, although leadership contenders will soon start to jockey. The problem is profound, the party was destroyed by the left-wing SNP in Scotland and thumped by the Conservatives here in the south of England. Ukip aid into their vote in the North of England as well. There will be no easy answers to their predicament. The Labour Party will hope to appeal to the people that Tony Blair wrought on board, to the people that Margaret Thatcher brought on board, the aspirational working and middle class people, the centre ground. The hope to stand in front of a new front door, but today ever lacked Ed Miliband looked happy his battle for number ten was at least over. Some end Labour will argue the party should move further left, and his defeat begins a struggle for Labour’s future. The family of a British student who’s been missing since the devastating earthquake in Nepal last month has confirmed that he was killed. 23-year-old Matthew Carapiet, an architecture student from Kent, was on his gap year and had been trekking through the Langtang Valley when the quake struck. Britain has temporarily stopped using a new military transport plane after one crashed near Seville airport in south-west Spain today, killing four crewmembers and seriously injuring the other two. The new Airbus AlIooM reportedly developed a faultjust after takeoff on a test flight. Russia has staged its biggest ever military parade to mark the 70th anniversary of its victory over Nazi Germany. More than 20 heads of state attended the event, although many Western leaders stayed away because of Russia’s role in the Ukraine crisis. Thousands of troops marched through Red Square in Moscow. A spectacle honed like a Hollywood movie. A massive parade to mark 70 years since the Nazi surrender and Russia’s role in its defeat. It is an anniversary which is almost sacred to most Russians. This year, they have pulled out all the stops. Over 16,000 troops marching across the cobbles. Regiments from across the country, including naval forces from Crimea and Cossacks. The hardware included one of their most advanced new battle tanks, reveal for the first time. A display reminiscent of how the Soviet Union used to flaunt its military might. This spectacle is one of the most elaborate parades on red Square in years, to commemorate one of the most defining moments in Russia’s history. It is also about today’s tensions. This show of force is to demonstrate that Russia can defend itself against its enemies and assert what it sees as its rights. Shadow is Ukraine. Of the 70 or so world leaders invited, less than half turned up. Ten years ago, George Bush stood next to Vladimir Putin on the podium. Five years ago, Welsh Guards from UKjoined the parade. Today, it was the Chinese President Hu was guest of honour. It was Chinese troops marching on the square. If President Putin was annoyed with the West, he was not showing it. He even thanked Britain, France and the United States for their wartime alliance. For most Russians, nothing will spoil this party. Even if the clouds of conflict in Ukraine cast a shadow over the blue sky. Here, 12,000 people have gathered in London’s Horse Guards Parade for a concert to mark the 70th anniversary of VE Day, when Europe celebrated the end of the Second World War. And injersey they’ve been celebrating the liberation of the island from the Nazis. Guards Parade became the perfect party venue. A musical end to the day when sound made a significant role in the commemorations. Earlier, rooftops had echoed to the peal of bells, led by those at St Paul’s in London. There had been called for a period of celebratory noise. And on the Thames at Greenwich, HMS Ocean obliged. In the Channel Islands, the old song spoke not a victory, but of liberation. 70 years ago, islanders had to wait a further 24 hours for an end to five years of Nazi rule. Today, the tramp of army boots heralded a re-enactment of the moment British troops finally stepped ashore. In every island, the people who were there looked back. That moment, we felt the shackles of captivity for. It was a moment when you saw tears in grown men’s eyes YOU SSW tE3I’S iIâ1 gI’oWIâ1 TT’IEIâ1iS EYES BFE. you saw tears in grown men’s eyes are. There was YOU SSW tESI’S iIâ1 gI’OWIâ1 TT’IEIâ1iS EYES SI’E. -i-i’IEIâE WSS OFIE are. There was one last symbolic act, a reaffirmation of the spirit that got everybody through the dark times. Back in London, a thunderous finale above the nation of noise, tonight’s party guaranteeing its guests and explosive sendoff. Now, Karthi Gnanasegaram at the BBC Sport Centre. Good evening. Peter Moores has expressed his frustration at not being given enough time after he was sacked as England’s cricket coach today. His dismissal followed the appointment of Andrew Strauss in a newly-created role as Director of England Cricket. 13 months ago, England said that Peter Moores was the outstanding coach of his generation. Now, he has been sacked. The second time England have dismissed him, and he is unquestionably hurt. England were woeful at the World Cup, beaten by Bangladesh, sent home early, but the dressing room seemed to be with him, and he remained widely respected. His Test cricket record was OK, the World Cup was very poor. The coach takes responsible to, but I have always said, look forward. Peter is a very good man. It is his second attempt, it did not work out. The man who has been hired is Andrew Strauss, now appointed director. Sucking Peter Moores was his opening move. Bold positions can pay off, but Peter Moores’ exit had seemed like an open secret. Turmoil again for English cricket. Nine out of the ten teams in the bottom half of the Premier League table were in action today, but it’s time to pop out of the room if you don’t want to know today’s results, as Match of the Day follows soon on BBC One. Burnley have been relegated to the Championship despite their 1-0 win over Hull City. Their victory wasn’t enough because of wins for Aston Villa, Leicester and Sunderland, while Newcastle also picked up a point, sealing Burnley’s fate. Hull drop into the relegation zone too. In the Scottish Premiership, Inverness Caledonian Thistle will play European football next season after securing third place with a 1-0 win over Dundee. Hamilton drew with Partick Thistle. While already-relegated St Mirren beat Ross County 2-1. And Dundee United and Stjohnstone drew. The Olympic heptathlon champion jessica Ennis-Hill made her competitive comeback today after almost two years away from the sport. Ennis-Hill finished in third place in the 100 metres hurdles at the Great City Games in Manchester. It was her first race since the birth of her son. European champion Tiffany Porter won in 12.86 seconds. You can see more on all of today’s stories on the BBC News Channel. That’s all from me. Good evening. While Saturday saw a gradual improvement, Sunday rings a more mixed picture. There will be spelt of sunshine for the South and East, but rain heading in from the west. We have already seen the arrival across parts of Northern Ireland, moving into south-west Scotland. The rain moves across the West of Scotland, and it to the north-west of England. Quite a win for many western areas. Mainly dry elsewhere, but a lot of low cloud. Eastern areas stay dry and fairly clear. A cold start to the day. Through the day tomorrow, the rain continues to push slowly north and east across Scotland. It stays dry and bright for a time around the Moray coast. For Northern Ireland, more rain heads in through the afternoon. England and have a fairly fine day, lots of dry weather. The best of the sunshine for central and eastern parts. A bit colder north and west. Monday and Tuesday, we hold on to the warmth for a time in the south-east, but colder conditions eventually filtering across the country. The next significant rain is likely during the course of Thursday. Enjoy the rest of your weekend. Reason for entering the country? Matt. . . LeBlanc. I’m just happy you guys are back.

It is about the future direction, huge swathes of Scotland in its grasp but time of the so-called Islamic State during a raid inside Syria - that’s according to the White House. Our North America Editorjon Sopel joins us from Washington - who was he and how significant is this? ~ I think it is a hugely significant moment because this is the first time as far as we know as far as has been acknowledged that US special forces have gone inside Syria to attack Islamic State targets. There was a failed mission last year to try to rescue the American journalist james Foley and other Western hostages but that was a separate operation. It seems that three months ago the president said, if we get intelligence that is actionable of high value Western targets around we reserve the right to go for them. Last might President Obama, it seems, ordered the Delta Force to cross the board from Iraq to Syria to try to capture a Tunisian, who it seems was running the oil smuggling operation on behalf of Islamic State. It is that that has effectively bankrolled the Sunni extremists. According to the US Defence Secretary, he was killed when he engaged US forces. It seems another dozen or so people might also have died in the raid. I think there’s huge satisfaction in Washington that it has been carried out, that he was killed and his wife, also suspected of being a member of Isis, was captured. The Syrians knew nothing about it. The Americans had not told them in advance that this operation would be happening. Thank you. The former Egyptian president Mohammad Morsi has been sentenced to death for his alleged involvement in a prison breakout four years ago. Morsi, who was Egypt’s first freely-elected president, was removed from power by the military in 2013.

Locked into a cage in the courtroom, Fqvpts Locked into a cage in the courtroom, Egypt’s former Islamist president proudly awaited his fate. And the judge recommended the ultimate punishment.

This is an emergency we believe it’s to be addressed with appropriate speed and resolved to originally coordinated effort to save the lives of thousands of vulnerable migrants and asylum seekers. The United Nations believes that over 20,000 of these people have lauded smugglers’s boats this year. There’s supposed to be a regional meeting to discuss the problem this month but it already feels like too little, too late. Football now, and after more than 700 games and 17 years at Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard is making his final appearance for the club at Anfield today in a match against Crystal Palace. Ben Smith is there. Yes, that game is under away at Anfield, behind me. Liverpool have taken an early lead, although not through Steven Gerrard. What has been noticeable before the game is the genuine strength of feeling the Steven Gerrard in the city. After 709 matches, 185 golds and a decade and a half of cherished memories that time has come to say goodbye. -- goals. This report contains flash photography. The skies were clear yet no masking and tears would be shared later, on the shirts come on the streets and on the stalls around this famous stadium, one name stood out. This was the day that Liverpool fans had hoped would never come. Definitely loads of two years, been dreading this day coming for a long time. He is the best player we have ever had. You could say that there were some more skinful, like john Barnes but he is the best. Irreplaceable. -- Barnes but he is the best. Irreplaceable. -- skilful. Overthe past two decades he has been the heartbeat of Liverpool Football Club. As a boy growing up on the Bluebell estate in Huyton heat dream discipline of being good enough to wear the red shirt. As a talisman and then as a captain he has not merely made his mark on Liverpool’s history, he has shaped it. This was the day that Liverpool fans got the chance to say thank you. At the final whistle, the emotion will be evident, both on the pitch and in the stands. Liverpool fans know that they may never see his like again. That’s it, we are back with the late news at 10:10. Now on BBC1 it’s time for the news where you are. Goodbye. Good evening, I’m Alice Bhandhukravi. An online campaign by the daughters of a cancer patient from Wimbledon has led to a sharp rise in the number of people joining the donor register. Rob Ireland needs a bone marrow or stem cell transplant to survive but his rare tissue type has meant no match has so far been found. Sarah Harris reports. Father and daughter have always been close, but they say his fight against an aggressive form of blood cancer has made the family from Wimbledon tighter than ever. When a tissue match couldn’t be found for his bone marrow and stem cell transplant Emma and her two sisters started an online campaign to sign up new donors. He’s such a positive inspiring person, that has helped me and my sisters so we have always had that inspiration, and there is no way this will be a sob story or a negative situation, it’s about making something positive happen. Almost 1000 Londoners have already signed up to the Anthony Nolan register since their campaign started with many more joining from around the world. It literally is putting your details online. You get sent a cup and you spit into it and you are on the register. It is for everyone, very global, or networked so often the Anthony Nolan people might be able to find a match for somebody in America and vice versa. It is really one of those things that is fantastic for this day and age, the media situation we are in. It is great and I am very proud of them as you can imagine, because I was believed they never listened to a word I said! That is an eye-opener for me! Rob’s tissue type is incredibly rare, but the family are happy to know that by increasing the number of donors, lives will be saved. Drivers are being warned that a section of the M25 will be closed tonight in both directions for an emergency services training exercise. The closure will affect traffic between junction 25, the A10 for Enfield and junction 27 the M11, from 10pm tonight until six o’clock tomorrow morning. Police say diversions will be in place. A pub in east London is set to re-open after a successful battle against new owners who wanted to turn it into flats. Campaigners fought to save the Chesham Arms in Homerton and a local landlord will now run it. A pint outside, in the sunshine, because inside, the pub is not ready yet. These regulars are celebrating saving their local, which will reopen next month, 1000 days after it called last orders. She wasn’t even born when the pub closed. So she has never been inside. She will be doing soon. The pub was boarded up after it was sold in 2012, the bar and internal fixtures were all removed. The developer plans to convert it into flats, but unhappy locals campaigned to save Save il. save it. Now any changes to the use of the building need planning permission. We are all absolutely delighted, is a real achievement, a triumph for community spirit, who are battling against developers who think that they can simply come into a community which they have no connection with, and make money for their own personal financial gain. This was the Carlton Tavern in Maida Vale. Developers have now been ordered to rebuild it, after they demolished it without permission to build flats. We are not saying pubs should not be redeveloped if there is a need and the community wants it, all we ask, as a community, is the chance to decide. Bearing into mind that people do want to move into areas that have places like pubs and it makes it more attractive to developers if there’s a good pub in the area. So it’s a win of the people in harm and with London losing nine a week the fight goes on for the capital’s pubs. Let’s get a check on the weather now with Elizabeth Rizzini. Overnight, dry, clear spells, a colder night than last night. Tomorrow, dry, lots of sunshine, especially through the morning, more clout in the afternoon and we have seen yet today, but still some good spells of sunshine, temperatures could get as high as 18 degrees, cooler than today. Rain on Sunday and into Monday ‘s it’s a wet start to the working week and blustery showers after that. That’s it, we’ll be back in tomorrow’s evening news, from everyone on the team enjoy your weekend, bye bye. Whilst temperatures are yet to realise those that we have a mid-May, the son has been trying to warm them up in mid-May. We have had showers, most lively in the Highlands, tonight they will merge to give a longer spell of rain pushing south through Scotland, shallots and Northern Ireland and the North of England, the rest of England and Wales will be mainly dry, colderthan England and Wales will be mainly dry, colder than this in rural spots so with lighter winds it will make an impact, some areas in low single figures as Sunday begins. A lot of dry weather to begin the day. By four o’clock tomorrow, the showers may be less lively in the Highlands, you can see them in southern Scotland and the far North of England. We still have that cool breeze and for the rest of England and Wales I don’t think we will see as much sunshine as today but still some sunny spells and perhaps the occasional shower, temperatures trying to get into the high teens in the sunniest parts of south-east England. The rain moves south Sunday night, clearing south-east England by Monday lunchtime, brighter skies in the afternoon. Still showers on Monday, particularly Northern Ireland and north-west England, still the cool breeze. If you think more of the same for the rest of the week, not far wrong, Welcome to a town where the famous are infamous... justin Bieber. Who’s this, your girlfriend?

Mr Murphy survived a vote of no confidence but said the party would remain divided if he stayed as leader. The Scottish Labour Party will rise again. It will be under someone else’s leadership and I’m confident about my party’s future. Mohammed Morsi, the former Egyptian president, is sentenced to death for his links with a prison breakout four years ago. And after 17 years playing for Liverpool, Steven Gerrard bids an emotional farewell to Anfield. Good evening. The leader of Scottish Labour, jim Murphy, is to resign, following a disastrous performance by the party at the general election. He made the announcement despite narrowly surviving a vote of no confidence from the party’s executive in Glasgow today. Labour was all but wiped out in Scotland at the election and left withjust one MP. Laura Bicker’s report contains flash photography. Gym Murphy said he would unite Scottish Labour, but after five months as leader, the party seems more divided than ever. He survived a vote of no confidence today, only just. Instead he’s decided to manage his own exit and leave in a month’s time. The Scottish Labour Party will rise again. It will be under someone else’s leadership and I’m confident about my party’s future. The Unite union says jim about my party’s future. The Unite union saysjim Murphy has done the decent thing, but Mr Murphy had robust words for the leader of that union, who blamed UK Labour’s general election defeat on him and Scottish Labour. That is a grotesque insult to the Scottish Labour Party. It’s a grotesque insult to thousands of volunteers from someone who pays occasional, fleeting visits to our great country. The trade union movement and individual Trade Unionists are a source of enormous strength and moral purpose for our party. Last week’s general election was the worst defeat in Scottish Labour Party history. Decades of dominance were swept aside by the SNP. Former First Minister, jack McConnell says whoever takes over has work to do. I don’t think they can look for any quick fixes. I don’t think they should be the SNP, Mr Murphy’s resignation was welcomed by some. But who could possibly entice them back? The Labour Party would have to go back to the grass-roots of what they had previously and the leaders they had previously. That’s why they’ve lost so many voters. The working-class element has gone within the Labour Party. They need to bring that back. Scottish Labour isn’t just looking for a new leader. Scottish Labour isn’t just looking fora new leader. It’s for a new leader. It’s looking for a new direction and crucially, a new voice that will resonate with a lost electorate. After last week’s crushing defeat, some fear that leader will also have to fight for the party’s very survival. Let’s talk to our Political Correspondent, Ben Geoghegan, who’s in Westminster for us. Labour is about to lose its leader in Scotland, it has no leader nationally, how do you assess where the party is now? Today has been another day of intense self-examination for Labour and it underlines again the scale of the task ahead, if it’s to win back seats from the Tories in England, as well as seats from the SNP in Scotland. Some leading figures in Scotland today have been saying the party there will simply have to become more distinctive. It will have to lock and sound more like a party that’s rooted in Scotland rather than seeing things through a Westminster prism. Some of the unions want Labour in Scotland to move further to the left. If that happens, it would have consequences potentially for the party in the UK as a whole. Today, some of the contenders for the Labour leadership, who want to take over from Ed Miliband, were at a conference in London organised by a Blairite think tank. They were sounding probusiness. They were putting distance between themselves and some of the things that Ed Miliband used to say and some of them were saying yes, we accept the criticism that we spent too much in the run up to the financial crisis. Labour has a difficult circle to square. They’re still dealing with the terrible outcome of the election and I think the story about how they rebuild themselves hasn’t yet been written. Ukip’s only MP has told the BBC that he thinks Nigel Farage needs a break as party leader - not to give up the leadership. Douglas Carswell said the party now needed to consider how to appeal to more voters. ~ I think it’s important that as leader he takes a break and I think it’s important that we work out how these complex questions are answered by a team. No one person has all the answers. I’m particularly concerned about tone and making sure we get a tone that ensures that the 27 million people who didn’t vote for Ukip last week may be persuaded to vote for fuss future. -- for us in future. See more on that story in the Sunday Politics at 11am tomorrow on BBC One. American special forces have killed a senior commander of the so-called Islamic State during a raid inside Syria, that’s according to the White House. Our North America Editor, jon Sopel, joins us from Washington. Who was he and how significant is this? Significance first. It is significant because this will be the first time that US Special Forces have launched an operation inside Syria to attack Islamic State. They went in last year to try to rescue the American journalist and other foreigners being capitalive there. That failed. This is the first operation of its kind. The president ordered the operation himself directly, sending Apache helicopters across the bored frer Iraq, with US Army Delta forces to capture Abu Sayyaf. He is significant because the Americans believe he was in charge of the oil smuggling operation and that is the money that Islamic State gets that keeps them afloat. So, he may not be a big figure on the battlefield, but a hugely significant figure. They’ve captured his wife and she is being taken away for questioning about other captives who may be being held in Syria. The former Egyptian president, Mohammad Morsi, has been sentenced to death for his alleged involvement in a prison breakout four years ago. Morsi, who was Egypt’s first freely-elected president, was removed from power by the military in 2013. The country’s religious authorities will have to give their opinion before the sentence can be carried out. Matthew Price reports. Locked into a cage in the courtroom, Egypt’s former Islamist president proudly awaiting his fate. And the judge recommended the ultimate punishment for Mohamed Morsi, and more than 100 others found guilty of a mass jailbreak. They do have legal avenues they can pursue, but this may well end in death for them all. Outside, a clear reaction, it seemed. TRANSLATION: It is good, we want the country to go back to normal, those criminals must die. But in a land where many fear to speak their minds, who knows if that is what they really think. So Mr Morsi, in effect, finds himself on death row, just three years after he was elected president following Egypt’s Arab Spring. Under his leadership, his country’s economy sank, instability grew, the people turned against him. And one year into the presidency, the military overthrew him. Since then Egypt, led now by a former army chief, has attacked his Muslim Brotherhood movement. Critics accuse the new president of crushing vertical dissent. ~ -- crushing political dissent. It is all out war between the judicial system and the Muslim Brotherhood. The judicial process is not taking any hostages. There is international unease about today’s death sentence but it is not being voiced loudly. Matthew Price, BBC News. The government of Myanmar, formerly Burma, says it’s not responsible for the thousands of migrants feared stranded in boats off the shores of south-east Asia. It says the region as a whole is failing to prevent human trafficking. Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand have been turning the boats away. The traffickers are now refusing to letthose on board return home unless ransoms are paid. Most of the migrants are Bangladeshi or persecuted minority Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar. Our correspondent, jonah Fisherm reports now from Sittwe in Myanmar on how one man is trying to bring those migrants home. This Muslim businessman is selling bricks and jellyfish. In the last week, he’s also become a life saver buying back young people from human traffickers. He paid for this group of teenagers last Sunday. With the smuggling routes to Thailand blocked, scores of boats packed with desperate people are in limbo at sea. The traffickers now want $200 a head so their cargo can go home. This man was also helped. He tells me he was packed with more than a thousand others on five boats near the Bangladeshi border. He pulled me over. Word of his generosity is spreading fast. This woman’s husband is on those boats still. On the boat, yeah. TRANSLATION: My husband told me, if I don’t pay the money, they will starve him to death. If he’s still alive, they say they will throw him into the water, so they have an empty boat. So he called the trafficker and the conversation quickly turned to how many people he owned and their price. I have to pay $3,600. Right now I will have to pay to give him, then I will receive those people tomorrow. Is her husband on the boat? Her husband on the boat, he also mention about her husband. He is also on the boat. Have you got the money? I’m going right now to try to get the money. How? I will sell up something I have. For me, money is nothing in front of the human life. So I must save the human life. I don’t care about that. I don’t care about my property. I don’t care about my money. But the traffickers do. They won’t let the Rohingya go. It’s really awful. Yeah, I’m really sorry for them. Time for the sport now. Let’s go to the BBC sports centre. After 17 years and more than 700 appearances, Steven Gerrard has played his last home match for Liverpool. He is due to leave in the summer to play for LA Galaxy in America’s MLS, and today at Anfield, the fans gave him an emotional send-off, as Ben Smith reports. This was the day when the Anfield rode turned into memory lane. The day that Liverpool says an emotional goodbye to perhaps its favourite son. The outpouring of adoration that came Steven Gerrard’s way was as poignant as it was emphatic. I’d like to thank all my team-mates today, in the squad, even the players that never got on, all the ex-players that I’ve played with, they’ve made me the player I am today. I have to say my last thank you to the most important people at any football club, but these supporters stand out more than any of them... CHEERING In the streets, on shirts and in the stalls around Anfield it had all been about one man. Yes, Steven Gerrard legend flags... This was the da I that Liverpool fans had wished would never come. But soon the reality of life after Steven Gerrard began to dawn. Over the past two decades, Gerrard’s been the heart beat of Liverpool football club, as a boy growing up in heighton, he dreamt of being good enough to wear the famous red shirt. As a talisman and then a captain, he’s not merely made his mark on Liverpool’s history, he’s shaped it. At Anfield today his comic career moved into its final chapter. Liverpool fans must now contemplate the future without him. Players move on. Players have to adapt. You have to change with the times. Liverpool’s going to have to do that. Other players come along. There’ll be someone, definitely. Steven Gerrard has played his final, emotional game here at Anfield and already some of the talk about a possible return, either as a player on loan or perhaps a manager in the future. Fora man on loan or perhaps a manager in the future. For a man whose built his reputation on impossible comebacks, it mayjust be that the greatest of them all is yet to come. Now if you are waiting to watch Match of the Day and don’t want to know the result from that game or today’s other Premier League fixtures, then make yourself scarce for the next couple of minutes. Well, it finished 3-1 to Crystal Palace in Steven Gerrard’s final match at Anfield. Sadio Mane scored the fastest hattrick in Premier League history, as Southampton thrashed Aston Villa. And a draw at Sunderland was enough to save Leicester from relegation. In Scotland there were big wins for Inverness Caledonian Thistle and for Kilmarnock, but Motherwell’s 2-1 loss at St Mirren means they face a play-off to retain their place in the Premiership. Leicester Tigers and Saracens are through to Rugby Union’s Premiership play-offs, after the last round of matches. The Tigers beat Northampton Saints, who were already guaranteed top spot, to book a semi-final against Bath. fourth. Results in the Pro 12 mean Glasgow and Ulster will meet in the semi-finals. Ospreys have also made it through to play Munster. England have secured a rugby Sevens place for Team GB at next year’s Rio Olympics, by qualifying for the quarter-finals at the World Sevens Series at Twickenham. They lost to Scotland but beat Kenya and Brazil to go through. England’s women can join them, with success in Amsterdam next weekend. And Britian’s Olympic champion Alistair Brownlee was narrowly beaten into second place in the latest leg of the World Triathlon Series in japan. After the swimming and cycling, Brownlee led coming into the final stages of the ten-kilometre run in Yokohama, only to be overtaken in a thrilling sprint by Spain’s javier Gomez. The next race is in London in two weeks. That is all your sport for now. You can see more on all of today’s stories on the BBC News Channel. That’s all from me, goodnight. Hello. 20 Celsius in Kent today. For most of us the temperature fell short of that and will do throughout this week, with chilly nights. Already chilly under clear skies tonight. For many of us it’s dry. Showers in Scotland, particularly the North West, merging to bring longer spells of rain. As ever, it is colder in rural spots rather than town and cities. Shave a few off this in the countryside. Some of us down into single figures as Sunday begins. But there will be sunshine to start the day. There is a band of showers pushing further south across Scotland and a few developing in Northern Ireland, the far north of England. The rest of us staying largely dry. We look at things in the afternoon. There may be a lull in the showers for a time in Scotland. It turns wetter in the evening. Showers around for Northern Ireland, southern Scotland, the far north of England. As cloud thickens, one or two showers pop up later in the day towards Wales and western England as well. But many places in England and Wales staying dry. There’ll be a bit more cloud around, still some sunny spells. Temperatures not up to much and a cool breeze. But it’s strong sunshine. It warms you up when it makes an appearance. It’s milder on Sunday night as rain sweeps south into Monday. Sunnier skies follow on behind, then come the showers, Scotland, Northern Ireland and North West England in particular. Temperatures again, for most, mid-to low teens. That’s where they’re going to stay. There will be sunnier daysin going to stay. There will be sunnier days in the week ahead. Wetter ones too.

Coming up we’ve got that match on Merseyside and also five clubs hoping they won’t also be saying goodbye to the Barclays Premier League. MUSIC: ‘Thank you’, by Alanis Morissette. In the studio, with their tissues at the ready, two men who have played with and against Steven Gerrard, Alan Shearer and jermaine jenas. We start with Aston Villa, one of five sides separated by four- points and hovering above that final relegation spot. Tim Sherwood knew a win at seventh placed Southampton meant they could enjoy those Cup Final preparations. Simon Brotherton was at St Mary’s. They may have stumbled lately, taking just a point from the last four games, but Europe is still a possibility for Southampton, while Aston Villa would settle for nearly staying up and a win today would guarantee it. james Ward-Prowse is backin guarantee it. james Ward-Prowse is back in midfield for Southampton, after serving a suspension following his recent red card at Sunderland, while Shane Long also starts. Schneiderlin and Tadic are both still out. There is one change for Villa, as they go for a third league win in a row. Alan Hutton replaces Kieran Richardson in defence. Benteke has scored ten goals in the last nine games. Mane, took line. -- to climb. Into once Pelle, the flag went up. Over on the far side, it won’t count, before Pelle put the ball in the net. But that was a very interesting call. Might be worth another look there. Southampton thought they had gone ahead. I think Pelle may have been onside. You can see the flag going up on the far side and no wonder he looks dismayed at that decision. Ronald Koeman stressing ahead of the match today, he is keen for Southampton to be playing European football next season. Villa, moving the ball around well. Benteke, and wide. The first chance of the game for Villa, Benteke couldn’t quite finish there. just trying to flick the ball inside the near post. You will be in demand over the summer, one the near post. You will be in demand overthe summer, one imagines. Pelle with the head on. Here is Mane, gets a deflection, surely a goal, yes! Mane! Well, they thought they had scored a few minutes ago, and they certainly have now. Mane, who got a goal at Sunderland in the 2-1 defeat a couple of weeks ago, gives his team the lead here. It wasn’t the tidiest of goals. He got a lucky bounce, but he made it count. The sliding challenge from blah, the ineffective one from Hutton, here is the first one from Ron Vlaar. The shot initially saved by Given and he buries it at the second attempt. Southampton one, Aston Villa nil. So Southampton ahead, having made the brighter start overall. Almost another opportunity, it could be two, and Mane is in a gain! And horrendous goal for Aston Villa’s defence to concede and Mane has two goals in one minute! No sooner had Southampton scored that first goal, than Villa gifted them a second. And Mane, the quickest out of the blocks, to make it 2-0 to the home side. A minute and 24 seconds between the two goals. Southampton’s push for a European spot is still very much alive. Well, Villa have an FA Cup Final to look forward to. They will be hoping his team play a whole lot better than this, against Arsenal, in two weeks’ time. Southampton flying forward again, with Shane Long. Mane is unmarked in the penalty area. Here he is! Oh, what an unbelievable hat-trick! Absolutely astonishing! Three goals in three minutes! ",,
171,BBC1 London,26-may-2015,Joins BBC News,01:10,290 mins,True,"for some 30 years now? Because there is so much more attention on the issue right now. Unfortunately this is because of the terrible events unfolding in the region notjust at sea but in these mass graves. But the world knows about the Rohingya in a way that they have not before and there is a lot of ground swell of support for them outside of Myanmar. We are hoping that with the right advocates in the room and with the right government became more loudly and the UN making a bigger commitment, we can make some positive movement here. You have just touched on some dingbat is crucial. The governments -- something that is crucial. There has been a reluctance until recently to crucially address the problem of the Rohingya people. And in Myanmar itself, what is going to change, do you think? Well, so far, the government has had no incentive to change anything. Infact government has had no incentive to change anything. In fact although the government has opened up its engagement with the international community and it chaired ASEAN last year and is more involved in international actions there has been, really ever, at the same time, it has been ethnically cleansing the Rohingya without consequence. That is what has to change. That is not something advocates can do. That is something only the UN can do through its member nations or that nations can do on their, the US, the UK, the EU. -- on can do on their, the US, the UK, the EU.-- on their Two Hong Kong government officials charged over the city’s worst maritime disaster in four decades are to go on trial. 39 people died when a passenger ferry collided with a pleasure boat off Lamma Island in October 2012. The captains of both vessels have already been tried. One was convicted of manslaughter and jailed for eight years, the other for nine months. The BBC’sjuliana Liu is in Hong Kong for us. Two senior officials at the marine department will be appearing at the district Court for a plea hearing today. They were charged earlier this year as a result of an inquiry that took place after the original 2012 disaster. One of the men is So Ping-chi, an assistant director at the Marine Department. He has been charged with one degree of misconduct while in office for allegedly failing to enforce lifejacket rules during his years in office. The other man is Wong Kam-ching and he has been charged with perjury for allegedly giving false statements during an inquiry announced by the chief executive of Hong Kong, CY Leung. V2 madmen, according to local media, face several years in prison if they are convicted. -- several years in prison if they are convicted. -- the two men. The captains of blood vessels involved in the accident have already been tried and are behind bars stop that is right. The two captains were tried in eight two months trial that was at times extremely emotional. -- a two-month trial. The captain of one vessel is serving an eight year and it. Another is serving nine months, acquitted of manslaughter charges. Blows were indicted during that investigation for a litany of errors and for not following procedure, causing those steps. The shipping lanes in Hong Kong are very busy. Since that accident in 2012, how have the safety rules and regulations improved? Well, the fact that the accident happened in 2012 was quite shocking at the time because this was a very popular route between Central, which is where we are, and Lamma, which is a small island popular with expatriate commuters. This was quite a shock because the sea lanes in Hong Kong are usually considered to be incredibly safe and and accident of this magnitude had it happened and -- since the early 1970s. Thank you.

Let’s take a look now at the morning’s papers. We start with the Wall Street journal Asia edition, which is reporting that China has slashed import duties on everything from shoes to cosmetics to encourage Chinese people to shop at home. The China Daily reports on a promise from Canada to help repatriate corrupt Chinese officials who have fled there and confiscate their assets. The lack of extradition treaties makes North America a favoured destination of Chinese fugitives. The International New York Times says more than 3,000 people from Bangladesh and Myanmar are now trapped in an administrative limbo in Indonesia and Malaysia. It highlights their plight with a striking photo of a woman and baby. But the full horror of the risks that migrants run in the region is brought home by a photo in the Straits Times. It shows Malaysian police carrying bags of what are said to be the exhumed remains of people who died after being smuggled into the country through Thailand. This is Newsday on the BBC. I’m Rico Hizon in Singapore. And I’m Babita Sharma in London. The headlines: As India looks set for two more weeks of scorching heat, the government urges people working outside to take extra precautions. Nearly 500 people have died in the heatwave.

Religious minorities are under ever increasing threat in Pakistan. The recent killing of members of the Shia Ishmaili community in Karachi has caused alarm. But young members of one minority community are refusing to be cowed. Young boys and girls from the Hazara tribe are taking up martial arts to protect themselves, as Saba Eitizaz reports from Ouetta in south-western Pakistan. Before they can play, the children must learn to fight. The only martial arts Academy buy were three town is full of young boys and girls who are training to make themselves physically and mentally strong -- Hazara town. Every child at the Academy has been affected by terrorism. Many in the Academy have won gold and silver for Pakistan at international events but more than that, they come here to battle a feeling of powerlessness. TRANSLATION: Every young boy and girl in our community is sent here for self-defense. We teach them that they are not victims, they can fight back against conditions by learning these skills. This girl is only 14 but already knows too much about loss. Herfatherwas but already knows too much about loss. Her father was kidnapped from outside their house two years ago, allegedly by militants. She says no government official was willing to help find him. Now her mother works as a maid to feed the family and she trains to make ourselves stronger. TRANSLATION: No one helped us when we needed it. It makes me so angry. Is it because we are Hazara? Why wouldn’t anyone help us? I want to learn karate to show the world that girls are not weak. Experts say young people in the Hazara community are under severe psychological strain. At least 1000 people have been killed by unknown assailants over the last two years. Religion is a factor as they are a minority Shia community in a predominantly Sunni nation. As a tax increase, they move from the city centre and authority status for their own protection. The Hazara she is are limited to ghetto areas on the very edge of Ouetta. You can see the mountain range and behind them, a city in which they cannot move around freely. The sense of entrapment grows stronger but their children have found a way, many ways in fact, to break free and find their identity and to be heard. The Hazara boys do not want to be seen as victims. Their performances have gone viral on social media and they have followers from all around the world but no one knows them at home. Despite being the only parkour group in Pakistan, they have no support. TRANSLATION: Evenif they have no support. TRANSLATION: Even if we are limited to these two areas like we are in a prison camp, we want to show that we can still make our country proud of us. These boys say they no longer feel trapped because they have found a way to be who they are, to free themselves from the reality of the Pakistan they live in. They say their hard work and her dreams will one day help them soar above their circumstances. -- their dreams. The greatest challenge yet to face the first round-the-world solar- powered flight has been postponed. Solar Impulse Two, had been due to take off from China for a non-stop five day flight. But the plans have been delayed because of bad weather over the Pacific Ocean. john Sudworth caught up with pilot Andre Borschberg. When you realise that it is not the right window and you take the decision, and I took the decision, of not going and I felt relieved because I felt we were taking too much risk. What has caused the delay? Why postpone it? We have a weather front which goes from Taiwan to Alaska. For us, it is a wall and we have to go over this wall. The only way is to find a whole in this wall. We found one but it is growing, it went from five days all the way up to seven days to reach Hawaii which is much too much. The higher the number of days, the less good the weather forecast is, so you leave the coast of China for many days and you are not sure that you will get to this solution. It is too risky. So what are your weather forecasters saying about when the next attempt, the next good window might be? It is too early because we focus our resources on all of this tomorrow -- focus our resources on all of this tomorrow -- focused. We worked quite a lot and we knew it wasn’t easy but we went over what I call the tipping point. In a few hours from now, we were meant to point. In a few hours from now, we were mea nt to start were meant to start but I’m sure in a few days, we will see another window and I hope this time it will be the right one. We look forward to coming back and seeing you off next time. Hundreds gathered to watch three cruise ships commemorating the 170 that anniversary of the Cunard line -- 175th.

If you are not a fan of Chelsea football club look away now, because the streets of West London turned into a sea of blue as Chelsea fans came out in force to celebrate winning the Premier League. Sarah Harris went to watch. Thousands of fans lined the route as the victory parade made its way from Stamford Bridge to the Kings Road. It has been a golden return for the special one, jose Mourinho. As far as Chelsea fans are concerned, he can do no wrong. He’s the best manager this club has ever had and I hope he stays for another 20 years. jose Mourinho! Didier Drogba came back and lifted the players up. We had the special one. jose Mourinho! Really good signings, especially Cesc Fabregas. It has really helped us in the Premier League. I hope jose Mourinho get some new signings for the Champions League and next year should be even better. After four years in Manchester, the title has returned to the capital. Yesterday ‘s win against Sunderland took them eight points clear at the top of the table having led the way from the start of the season. And it looks like their manager is here to stay this time. Chelsea is the team I’ve been working on for the last two years, and I have been working on Chelsea’s future. It would be a dream to be here in 2025. And that would give Chelsea fans even more to cheer about. Congratulations to Chelsea. Do you have a sweet tooth? Maybe not sweet enough for this. Here you can see the largest ever tiramisu under construction in the northern area of Italy. The coffee and cream -based dessert weighed in at a staggering 3015 kg. It took many people to put together 8000 L of coffee and half a ton of biscuits. I love tiramisu. Lee has been inundated with clowns. It is not a horror film been inundated with clowns. It is not a horrorfilm but not a horror film but an event celebrating Clowned Day. Thousands marched through the city entertaining the crowds dressed up as clowns. Scary. What a way to end a programme, clowns and tiramisu. Rico will be here with Asia Business Report. Thank you forjoining us. Bank Holiday Monday wasn’t spectacularly sunny but it was a dry day for many. That dry and cloudy theme will continue to Tuesday. Maybe drier during the day with few places seeing more sunshine. We will start with sunshine across eastern England but elsewhere a lot of loud and maybe one or two showers in parts of western Scotland. That will increase generally through the course of the morning and into the afternoon for it hopefully breaks up later on. We could see some sunshine returning to parts of Wales and south-west England. There will be a lot of cloud over temperatures in the mid to high teens. 18-19 possible in the sun. Cloud developing across eastern England but there will be sunny spells as there will be across the south-west and Northern Ireland. Across Northern Ireland and the west of Scotland, quite a lot of cloud with brightness across eastern Scotland and showers possible in the west. Should be a dry day in Paris. Sunny spells on Wednesday could see a high of 21 degrees. In the UK, still a few showers in the evening on Tuesday across the north-west. They will pick up as we go towards Wednesday morning. Elsewhere it will be a dry night with largely clear skies across the south with mist and fog possible and temperatures widely down into single figures in towns and cities. Country areas will be down to four minus five degrees in some areas. A fresh start on Wednesday with sunny spells in the south at first. Still some showers in northwest Scotland and wet in Northern Ireland by the end of the morning. This ring will trickle into other western areas during the day and the winds will pick up -- rain. Brightness in the Southeast means we could reach up to 20 Celsius. Wet weather in the west is from an area of low pressure which will dominate our weather from Thursday and Friday. Many isobars on the charts and the winds picking up. Bringing sunshine but plenty of showers to end the week. They will get quite lively on Thursday with some hail and thunder mixed in cross the north and west and a cool breeze blowing. These notes will not see many showers. In the capital, temperatures up to 14 degrees. Cool for the time year. Winds will ease by Friday with not as many showers in the afternoon but it is another day with some sunshine and quite a few downpours. Goodbye. ~ This is BBC News. As India looks set for two more weeks of scorching heat, authorities have urged people to stay indoors and drink plenty of fluids. Nearly 500 people have died in the heatwave. Most deaths have happened in the southern states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Thailand has announced plans to deploy a helicopter to pick up migrants stranded in the Andaman Sea. Thailand’s Prime Minister says the carrier will serve as a temporary medical and processing centre. The move follows last week’s offer of temporary shelter from Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia. Two Hong Kong government officials charged over the city’s worst maritime disaster in four decades are to go on trial. 39 people died when a passenger ferry collided with a pleasure boat off Lamma Island in October 2012. The captains of both vessels have already been given jail sentences. Detectives hunting a man suspected of killing three members of a family in Didcot have discovered his body.

The head of the World Trade Organisation says deadlocks trade talks can be revived. They want it done.

Indonesia aims to build 1 million homes to rehouse the poor. Welcome and thank you forjoining us. As the World Trade Organisation marked its 20th year in existence, the global body is at a tipping point. The so-called Doha round of trade negotiations has been deadlocked since 2008 just as an increasing number of regional and bilateral trade eels are making progress. Now the countdown has begun to try to get Doha restarted and the head of the wto says he is confident that finally a deal can be done. -- WTO. We asked whether the organisation will still be relevant in another 20 years. Even more so Even TT’IOI’â So because getting more interconnected than ever and there are a number of those problems in terms of international trade that can only be solved multilaterally. Clearly, for example, the case of subsidies, agricultural subsidies or domestic subsidies. You do not deal with those bilaterally, it’s impossible. You have to do it multilaterally. But has the job being taken over by these other multilateral agreements over many countries? But they don’t and cannot address these issues. For example, regulations on telecommunications and other kinds of services. All those things can only be done multilaterally because you cannot do it for... Like a trade facilitation. Either you facilitate trade at the border for everybody else or you don’t because you cannot do itjust else or you don’t because you cannot do it just for do itjust for one country. Each country, it each import, you cannot treat it differently. You say that more progress needs to be made. Indeed, the WTO is not a dynamic organisation. What makes you confident that now things will change? 2008 you were stuck. 2015 you say it is all good? Not everything is good. I think that we now know we can do things. Look, when I got there about two years ago, nobody believed we would do the trade facilitation agreement. The text was. .. trade facilitation agreement. The text was... We had something like 300, 400 brackets around the text and we had just three months to get there and we did it. Why was that? Because what we really need is the will of the members to do it? Is they will really there now? I think it is. I think people all value the system for different reasons and different purposes but they all value the system and they all want the system. They want it done. Clearly, each one of them want it done their way but that is not going to happen, sol done their way but that is not going to happen, so I think at this point in time, at least they are sitting at the table. They are migrating towards more vague solutions framework. OK, so you won’t do that. Find. I won’t insist on this any more, but maybe we can do something else. This something else, this search for the sum in else, that was not there before. -- search for the something else. Since 2008, people have not been looking for the something else. And now they are. Doha is not dead? Certainly, it is not dead. But it is up to the members. Then they have to decide whether they can or cannot. What cannot happen is to have negotiations being on so many different issues held hostage. We have to figure out whether we can do it or not and if we cannot do it, then what? What is the next dead? How do we make this work? The director-general of the WTO. General Motors has seen its results -- fall in its shares ahead of its results released later today. Definitely, yes. Ithink results released later today. Definitely, yes. I think that the returns are a very clear indication that we have seen profitability in China go down. Today, the Land Rover accounts for 25% of the overall GM range. And... Apart from the government clamping down on corruption, which has hurt luxury items, as the discontinuation of the Land Rover free lander and the introduction of the new model also impacted scale -- sales? Ithink that the major reason is that we have this anti-corruption campaign. Overall, sales have come down relatively. There was pressure... But yes, these were the old models, so that could be another reason. Thenin so that could be another reason. Then in 2015, we will see new models like a Discovery, which are really expected to be a good sale in China. The domestic market of Tata, which is led by the Nano... How can they turn their sales around at home or overseas? I think the secret to success is introducing new products, especially in a market like India, where most of the global companies are coming up with global products and there is quite a focus on... I think that they have to follow the same path going forward. China plans to cut import taxes on consumer goods by more than 50% on average. The cuts will take effect on the first ofjune and are aimed at boosting consumer spending. High tariffs for imported goods have prompted some Chinese people to shop overseas or through agents. Singapore’s SIFIQBPOFEIS ECOFIOITIV last quarter from the previous year despite a contraction in the manufacturing industry. It grew a 2.6%. Growth in construction helped offset the falls in transport, engineering, electronics and biomedical manufacturing. In Indonesia, only around 60% of people live in appropriate housing but the government has plans to change all of that with an ambitious programme to try to build 1 million homes before the end of the year. Aimed at people on low incomes, there are still big challenges. Skyscrapers and big houses, a sign of Indonesia’s growing economy. But not everyone enjoys a decent life. This man is a fisherman injakarta. He has been living in this house for around 40 years because he cannot afford anywhere else. TRANSLATION: Sometimes I can catch fish but often I don’t. So, I don’t have any money. He is one of an estimated 100 million Indonesians living in poor accommodation. To try to solve this problem, the Indonesian government has set itself the goal of building 1 million houses within a year for people on low incomes such as farmers, fishermen and labourers. Progress here is slow but the plan is to spread the houses across all of the country’s 34 provinces by the end of the year. The government says it will cost around $6 billion to build the houses injust 12 months with a loan from the Asian Development Bank. The authorities are optimistic the project will be a success. We are optimistic that this project will be completed because our investors are committed to our programme. But projects like this are not new. Around eight years ago, the Indonesian government tried to implement a similar programme by building these low-cost apartments. But many purchasers did not hold onto them for long. They made big money selling them on the open market, earning up to treble the opening price. The buyers claimed to be poor people and they had the financial facility of low interest rates. The government is considering what role they can put in place to stop profit takers from gaining an unfair advantage. stop profit takers from gaining an unfairadvantage. Even if stop profit takers from gaining an unfair advantage. Even if there are strict regulations, the challenge will be enforcing them. Still, many hope the housing project goes ahead and is not abandoned. While our fisherman does not want to move away from the water and his fishing boats, he does want better accommodation. My house only has one window. It does not have electricity. I need a proper house. He is one of millions of Indonesians who wants the same thing. -- want. A quick look at the markets, now.

The top stories this hour: As India looks set for two more weeks of scorching heat, the government urges people working outside to take extra precautions. Nearly 500 people have died in the heatwave. Thailand has announced plans to deploy a helicopter carrier to pick up migrants stranded in the Andaman Sea. The carrier will become a temporary medical and processing centre. Detectives looking for a man suspected of killing his younger sister, motherand her partner suspected of killing his younger sister, mother and her partner had discovered his body in Oxford. Police had been searching for the 21-year-old man since his family members were found dead at their home in Didcot on Saturday. This was where the search for jed Allen came to an end. An area of woodland in Oxford, 50 miles or so where tragedy had unfolded 48 hours earlier. just before five o’clock this evening, members of the public reported finding the body of a man in a wooded area in Oxford. While no formal identification has taken place, I am satisfied that this is the body ofjed Allen, who I previously named as a suspect in this investigation. Residents say it is a busy area, popular withjoggers and dog walkers. I am quite shocked. It is quite a distance to get here. How come they didn’t widen the search area? Police had released the last recorded sighting of jed Allen alive, CCTV of him shopping at a railway station at six o’clock on Saturday evening. 2.5 hours later, the bodies of his sister, his mother and her partner were discovered. They had been stabbed to death. The search for the 21-year-old had covered most of the city. It was centred on parklands at Oxford University, where Mr Allen worked as a groundsman. While the policemen were looking for her brother, classmates of his sister were dealing with what had happened. None of us wanted to tell the kids what happened. We were trying to hide it. Today it is good. It has been a way of breaking it to them. Better than adults crying. Do you think the children understand what has happened? Not really. They know she is not coming back to school. We discussed that. We cannot discuss the details. They cannot understand it and they should not have to. The head teacher says the school and the community as a whole is heartbroken. How do you begin to comprehend such an awful tragedy? She was a very sweet, happy, precious little child. Ifjed Allen did kill three people, including his sister and mother, nobody can explain why. The police investigation may be over, but many questions remain. Time now for all the sports news in Sport Today. ~ Hello, I’m Nick Marshall-McCormack and this is Sport Today from the BBC sport centre. Coming up: Paying the price for a bare trophy cabinet. Real Madrid fire coach Carlo Ancelotti. Norwich City win the richest match in football and return to the English Premier League. And a man of the match performance from Ben Stokes guides England to victory over New Zealand. Hello, wherever you are around the world, welcome to Sport Today. Real Madrid President Florentino Perez has sacked Carlo Ancelotti as he looks to give the Spanish giants ""fresh impetus"". Ancelotti had one year left on his contract but became the fall guy for a season without any major silverware. That came after a brilliant 2014 where he led Real to a record-extending tenth European crown and a Kings Cup triumph in Spain. But this season, they were eliminated in the Champions League semi-finals byjuventus and beaten in the Spanish league by Barcelona. I spoke to Spanish football expert juan Castro for his analysis. After the defeat with juventus, Carlo Ancelotti was in the street as we say. There was no possibility for him to continue because the president thinks that it was already his final time in Real Madrid. The president said it was time to get fresh impetus. Where will he go for that? Benitez is top of the list. He is right now the number one. The president has said two things, that the new coach has to speak Spanish, and Benitez is Spanish and has played professionally for Real Madrid and the second thing is that the new coach will be presented in two weeks time. Benitez still has to complete one week more with Napoli. We are already talking about competitors to replace Carlo Ancelotti but what about the man of such an Norma’s pedigree -- enormous? Where does he go now? He has said there were only two possibilities. He will stay in Real Madrid or he will go to rest for a year. Asjuan Castro mentioned Rafa Benitez is top of the list. He is out of contract with Napoli. And the BBC understands he’s in advanced negotiations. Former Borussia Dortmund coach jurgen Klopp is in the mix after a seven year stint with the German club. Then there is Zinedine Zidane. The Galactico is already part of the coaching staff at the Bernabeu and is highly favoured by president Perez. The Barcelona defender Dani Alves says he doesn’t feel ""fully respected"" at the club suggesting he will leave at the of the season. The Brazil international’s contract expires this summer and he’s yet to sign a new deal. Alves has made 44 appearances this season for the Spanish champions and his departure would be a blow to the Catalan club as they face a transfer ban until 2016. Roma have secured automatic Champions League qualification in Serie A, after beating Lazio 2-1. 55,000 packed Stadio Olympico for the Rome derby to see Roma come out on top and take second place in the league. Lazio finish third and now go into the Champions League play-off round. Galatasaray are Turkish league champions for a record 20th time. They secured the title after bitter rivals Fenerbahce could only draw 2-2 against Istanbul Basaksehiras. It was an ugly game where Fenerbache had four players sent off. So Galatasaray fans took to the streets and lit their flares as they celebrated an unassailable five-point lead at the top of the table with one match to play. It’s Galatasaray’s third title in the last four seasons. And to Norwich fans, welcome back to the English Premier League! The Canaries won the most lucrative match in football, the Championship Playoff against Middlesbrough at Wembley. Norwich manager, Alex Neil said it was all about his team having self-belief. They were relegated last season and returned with a 2-0 win. Many of the players who went down with the team to the Championship helped the side to go straight back up. There was a lwa ys always a risk of the most dangerous score line in football but we showed fantastic determination and a desire to get where we believed we should be. It is not being arrogant, we have a fantastic group of players and an unbelievable manager and hopefully we will continue to do well. England captain Alistair Cook said ""It’s one of the best matches"" he’s ""ever been involved in"" after his side beat New Zealand in a thrilling first cricket test at Lords. New Zealand were set a target of 345 for victory on Monday after England’s Ben Stokes had hit the fastest test century at Lords on day four. He then took three wickets to help bowl-out the Black Caps. England won by 124 runs. just a brilliant game. A brilliant test match from both sides coming really. They played in a brilliant spirit and highly competitive but in the right way. We were lucky to come out with the right results and full credit to them. To England ‘s credit, they were too good for us in crucial stages of the test match but I’m still really proud of the achievements of our GUYS proud of the achievements of our guys and the way that we kept getting it through the test match. I thought it was a fantastic match to be a part of. To play five days in front of full houses at Lord’s and for it to come down to the final ten overs is a testament to what a good match was. When you stand at a cricket ground where the sport has been played forever 200 years, it is fair to say that this is one of the best matches Lord’s has ever seen but it was a record-breaking test match and one that until past six o’clock local time. There were stunning individual performances on both sides but especially for England with The Captain Alastair Cook giving calm leadership on the final day which shows he is back in form. Ben Stokes, even more so. They have the kind of figureheads now to keep attention going in the sport which is a good talking point especially in this country. What wickets they were. Kane Williamson and then Nathan McCullum. The second test begins injust a few and then Nathan McCullum. The second test begins in just a few days time at Headingley but England, who say that they have proved the virtue of the team and mutual trust, this is a hard-fought victory. Reigning French Open champion Maria Sharapova has a cough and a cold and there were none of her usual shouts of ""c’mon!"". But the Russian opened her defence by grinding out a win over Estonian Kaia Kanepi. Tennis correspondent Russell Fuller was watching day 2 action for us at Roland Garros. Maria Sharapova ‘s first-round opponent looked to be her toughest challenge of this opening week. Kaneph challenge of this opening week. Kanepi, twice a quarterfinalist at Roland Garros has tons of experience and is a formidable opponent on her day yet Maria Sharapova took it in straight sets. Kanepi served a double fault with one match point down. Maria Sharapova has not been feeling very well and didn’t think she could speak to the press afterwards but said it should not hold her back for the rest of the fortnight. And the desperate 2015 for this player continues as she lost a deciding set to the German contender. Venus Williams also was beaten today but she has had a really tough first-round draw against her fellow Americans Sloane Stephens. In the men’s competition, Andy Murray was one of the high-profile winners. Very easily indeedin high-profile winners. Very easily indeed in straight sets against the Argentinian wildcard. We struggled with our timing Argentinian wildcard. We struggled with ourtiming a with our timing a little bit. The conditions were extremely slow. Much slower than usual. On that course and perhaps a lot of the outside courts, it was much quicker-- courts. I’m not sure why that is coming much lower balancing than usual. Normally the court is high balancing and fairly quick. It is very different this year. The Houston Rockets will play Game four of their NBA Western Conference final.

Bank Holiday Monday was not spectacularly sunny but a dry day for many. That dry and rather cloudy theme will continue for Tuesday but perhaps brighter during the day with more places seeing sunshine. We start the day with sunshine across eastern England. Elsewhere, a lot of cloud and one or two showers continuing in parts of western Scotland which will increase through the course of the morning and into the afternoon before the cloud breaks up later on. We could eventually see some sunshine returning to parts of Wales and south-west England to stop there will be a lot of cloud with temperatures in the mid to high teens and some sunshine, 18- 19just about possible in that. There will be some sunny spells across the south-west of Northern Ireland. Elsewhere across Northern Ireland and western Scotland, quite a lot of cloud with brightness across eastern Scotland and sunny spells possible in, while there will be showers in the west. In the UK, quite a lot of showers in the evening across Tuesday. We will see those showers picking up as we go towards Wednesday morning. Elsewhere, a dry night with clear skies across the south and mist and fog patches possible. Temperatures widely down into single figures in towns and cities. Country areas could be down to 4-5 degrees in some areas. A fresh start Wednesday with sunny spells in the south. Eastern area staying finder today but still showers in northwest Scotland and it turns wet in northwest Scotland by the end of the day. This rain will head into western areas by the end of the day and it will feel quite cold in Glasgow. We could reach 20 Celsius on Wednesday.

Welcome to BBC News, broadcasting to viewers on public television in the US and around the globe. My name’s Mike Embley. Our top stories. Nearly 500 people have died during a heatwave in India and extreme temperatures could continue for another two weeks. A tornado rips through the Mexican city of Acuna as severe weather kills more than a dozen people. The United States is also hit hard - flash flooding in Texas claims lives and destroys hundreds of homes. And three queens in formation - tens of thousands line the banks of the Mersey to mark the 175th anniversary of the Cunard shipping line. A heatwave sweeping India has killed more than 500 people, with most of the deaths in the southern states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. With temperatures reaching 48 degrees Celsius authorities are urging people to stay indoors and drink plenty of water. Ben Bland reports. As temperatures soar throughout India, people seek shade wherever they can. Exhausted by the extreme heat, others cool off in whatever way possible. In Kolkata in the east, drivers of the iconic yellow taxis have been urged by their unions to stay off the roads during the hottest hours. But some people were doing their best to carry on with business as usual. Despite warnings to drink plenty of water and stay indoors, so far as many as 500 people have died because of the heat. The worst affected states are Andhra Pradesh and Telangana in the south but across the country, the heatwave is expected to continue well into the coming week. Recently, we have had 48 degrees and we will keep these levels for the next few days. It is notjust the heat during the day that is dangerous but at night as well. The next few days will have the highest temperatures again across northern parts of India and severe heatwave warnings across the north-western plains. Until the monsoon rains bring cooler temperatures, there are fears the heatwave could yet claim more lives. With me is Alex Deakin from the BBC’s weather centre. The this is something else, isn’t it? Temperatures are widely over 40 Celsius. We are seeing temperatures pushing the high 40s. Maybe as high as 50 degrees, 122 Fahrenheit. These are as much as 10 degrees above average. Significantly above normal. And people are not getting any respite at night. That is one of the health issues. At the moment, temperatures are above by day and night. There is no relief. If this goes on, it puts a lot of pressure on the body, particularly all the more vulnerable members of society. Is it going to go on? The prognosis is not great. Temperatures will remain above average by a number of degrees. It depends where you are in India as to what time the monsoon arrives. It is scheduled to arrive sometime next week. It depends where you are. And even people in India are finding this unusual. Exactly. Itjust goes to show. It gets hotter at this time of year in India. It shows how unusually hot that he is. It could continue to cause issues. Thank you for seeing us. A powerful tornado has swept through northern Mexico, killing at least 16 people and causing widespread destruction. Most of the confirmed deaths are in a Mexican border city of Ciudad Acuna, which was hit by winds of up to 300km/h. Elaine jung has more. Street after street, the destruction laid-back, hundreds of homes torn apart. Vehicles resting against homes and roots. Seven blocks left devastated by the tornado. More than 1000 homes affected, leaving many with nowhere to go. All this from a tornado sweeping through at speeds of up to 300 kilometres per hour. It lasted six seconds. In the aftermath, bodies were found scattered across neighbourhoods. Residents clearly shellshocked and grieving the sudden loss of loved ones. Striking the northern Mexico border city of Ciudad Acuna, home to 136,000 people, the powerful tornado was a first for this town, built more than a century ago. As locals pick through the pieces, the desperate search for survivors continues. Our correspondent Katy Watson is in Mexico City. This is really unusual for Mexico, isn’t it? Residents in Mexico are used to hearing about twisters on the other side of the border in the United States. They were not expecting to experience one first-hand. It is the first time since the town was found that they have seen a tornado. The infrastructure in Ciudad Acuna was not appropriate and there has been more damage than would otherwise have been seen. One -- the president says he will visit the town to oversee the rescue efforts as well as help from the United States. The pictures are pretty shocking, and all of this injust pictures are pretty shocking, and all of this in just a few seconds? That is right. The mayor said it took half-an-hour work to six seconds. It came at a time when people are going to school and work. A lot of the injuries and deaths were from cars in the street. Cars have been thrown like matchsticks. If people are not used to this kind of weather, they were not expecting it and they were not prepared. They were not such prepared, neither were the buildings. The infrastructure is not really appropriate to the weather we have seen. That is the biggest damage, that is what we have seen. That is why it the President will be visiting to see what he can do first-hand. This is something Mexico has seen. Hurricane season is coming. In that part of Mexico close to the border, tornadoes are not the things that are more likely. At least three people have died in flash flooding in Texas in the United States. Another 12 are reported missing after their holiday home was swept away by floodwater. Some areas saw up to 10 inches of rain over a 24-hour period. Hundreds of homes have been destroyed. The state governor said it was the worst flooding Texas has seen. Let’s go live to Texas now - jason Whitely, Senior Reporter for ABC’s WFAA TV in Dallas, who has been following the story. Thank you for giving a short time. How is it looking? Behind us is a river running through Dallas. The water is normally a narrow channel. So much water has spelt out. It is quite a sight to see. The Governor has been touring the area. It has killed five people, it is still a serious situation, a frightening situation. Something so many people say they have never seen. With Memorial Day there would have been a lot of people coming to stay in homes along the river. An unlucky choice, as it turned out. Absolutely. The area in central taxes is very popular. -- Texas. The river rose 26 feet in 24 hours. That is how high the water came. People were on vacation for the long holiday weekend. Having no idea that there would be such a severe storm. Firms were literally washed away. And as you were saying, it has rained for so long. It looks at it will go on for quite a while. How does this compare with the records? This is the fourth wettest May in Texas history. 18 of the last 25 days, we have not seen the sun a lot. It will continue at least until the end of the month. The forecast is not look good. We have seen extraordinary scenes. At one stage, a carjust going down the river, upside down. It is claiming lives, this weather. Unfortunately it is. You can see lightning flashing. We do not see a lot of this in Texas, bridges being washed out. But the storm washed multiple bridges out and multiple roads. That is what caused some of the loss of life. Time around, do not drown. Sometimes the water does not look that deep. That had unfortunate circumstances. Thank you. China’s state media says a fire at a restaurant has killed 38 people and injured sex. -- injured sex. Two of the injured are in serious condition. The British Prime Minister, David Cameron and the president of the European Commission, jean-Claude juncker, have met to discuss plans to renegotiate Britain’s membership of the EU. Mr Cameron is due to visit several European capitals this week, to try to drum up support for his plans. The Conservative government has promised an in-out referendum by the end of 2017. An Air France plane has been escorted to New York’s jFK Airport by US fighterjets, following an anonymous call claiming there were chemical weapons on board. Two F-16 fighters were scrambled to shadow the plane which was en route to the US from Paris. The FBI confirmed passengers had disembarked safely and no dangerous substances had been found Much water come, including this. A world famous literary gathering. First though the stories making newspaper headlines around the world. The Asian edition of the Wall Street journal reflects on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s first year in office. He’s allowed more foreign investment in railways and defence, but on other key fronts the paper suggests he’s moved less decisively, frustrating investors who hoped for bolder change. According to China Daily, import taxes on some popular goods, such as suits, furs and skin products, are to be cut by around 50 %, to encourage Chinese people to spend more money at home, rather than buy abroad. The US edition of the Financial Times reports Chinese officials are being sent to visit their shamed former colleagues in prison, in the hope they’ll be scared into abiding by the law and refusing bribes. The UN Nuclear watchdog has criticised japanese authorities for not preventing the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011. It says weaknesses were not fully assessed. That’s in the japan Times. This is BBC News. The latest headlines: As India looks set for two more weeks of scorching heat, the government urges people working outside to take extra precautions. Nearly 500 people have died in the heatwave. A tornado has borne through the Mexican city of Andhra Pradesh. It has killed at least a dozen. Earlier this month militants from Islamic State seized the Iraqi city of Ramadi. Its fall was seen as a major capitulation by the Iraqi Army in the strategically important Anbar Province. Since then, Iraqi government forces, backed by Shia militia, have been mobilising there, to try to take the fight to IS. Our World Affairs Editorjohn Simpson travelled with a group of Shia militias to the town of Garma, about halfway between Baghdad and Ramadi Anbar province. Vast, empty, basically desert, and natural territory for IS. It has been the battleground for years. The Americans built fortifications when they wear here. Now, as then, the enemy’s weapon of choice is the roadside bomb. We reach Garma as the government forces are firing at Islamic State’s last positions in the town. IS has been forced out of the rest of it. We are with a so-called popular mobilisation unit, a militia mostly composed of Shia Muslims commanded by Sheik Ali Dehish, a dapper character in a uniform of his own devising. The militias are the only government troops who seem able to resist Islamic State’s ferocity. But Anbar province is Sunni. Is there a danger that these men will fight a sectarian war here? TRANSLATION: I carry the flag of Iraq, because I do notjust represent Shia or Sunni. I represent the whole of Iraq. This is what they call the frontline in the sense that it is the closest that the Iraqi forces get to the last remaining Islamic State positions. just on the other side of that ridge there. Mostly, the fire is outgoing. There aren’t that many Islamic State fighters left. But they’ve just told us we have to get out in case all the excitement attracts incoming mortar fire. And Islamic State’s by no means finished in Anbar province. Another BBC team travelling with the Iraqi army came under fire from Islamic State when the battle started. It is one of the characteristics of fighting a war in Anbar that you scarcely ever get a look at your enemy. It’s a matter of life and death for the Iraqi government to drive Islamic State out of Anbar. The government believes it can be done and by the end of the year. Western diplomats are inclined to agree. But it will be an immense task. Religious minorities are under ever increasing threat in Pakistan. The recent killing of members of the Shia Ishmaili community in Karachi has caused alarm. But young members of one minority community are refusing to be cowed. Young boys and girls from the Hazara tribe are taking up martial arts to protect themselves, as Saba Eitizaz reports from Ouetta in south-western Pakistan. Before they can play, the children must learn to fight. The only martial arts academy in Hazara town is full of young boys and girls who are training to make themselves physically and mentally strong. Every child at the academy has been directly affected by extremism and persecution. Despite limited resources, many at the academy have won gold and silver for Pakistan at international events but more than the awards, they come here to battle a feeling of powerlessness. TRANSLATION: Every young boy and girl in our community is sent here for self-defense. We teach them that they are not victims, they can fight back against the conditions by learning these skills. Samira is only 14 but already knows too much about loss. Her father was kidnapped from outside their house two years ago, allegedly by militants. Samira says no government official was willing to help find him. Now her mother works as a maid to feed the family and Samira trains to make herself stronger. TRANSLATION: No one helped us when we needed it. It makes me so angry. Is it because we are Hazara? Why wouldn’t anyone help us? I learn karate because I want to show the world that girls are not weak. Experts say young people in the Hazara community are under severe psychological strain. At least 1000 people have been killed by unknown assailants over the last two years. Religion is a factor as they are a minority Shia community in a predominantly Sunni nation. As threats and attacks increase, they have been moved from the city centre. Authorities say it is for their own protection. The Hazara Shias, limited to ghetto areas on the very edge of Ouetta. You can see, in front of them the mountain range, and behind them, a city in which they cannot move around freely. The sense of entrapment grows stronger but their children have found a way, many ways in fact, to break free and find their identity and to be heard. The Hazara parkour boys do not want the world to see them as victims. Their performances have gone viral on social media and they have followers from all around the world but no one knows them at home. Despite being the only parkour group in Pakistan, they have no support. TRANSLATION: Even if we are limited to these two areas like we are in a prison camp, we want to show that we can still make our country proud of us. These boys say they no longer feel trapped because they have found a way to be who they are, to free themselves from the reality of the Pakistan they live in. They say their hard work and their dreams will one day help them soar above their circumstances. A planned round-the-world flight for a sun powered plane have been put on hold. Solar Impulse Two, had been due to take off from China for a non-stop five day flight. But the plans have been delayed because of bad weather over the Pacific Ocean. john Sudworth caught up with pilot Andre Borschberg. When you realise it is not the right window and you take the decision, and I took the decision of not going, Ifelt relieved because I felt it was not... We were taking too much risk. What has caused the delay? Why postpone? The weather front from Taiwan to Alaska. For us it is a wall and we have to go over this wall. And the only way is to find a hole in this wall in fact. We find one but, initially it took five days, then six days, than seven days to reach Hawaii - much too much. The higher the number of days, the less goodis higher the number of days, the less good is the reliability of the forecast. So you leave the coast of China for many days and we are not sure you will get to this solution. And so it is too risky. What next? Are your weather forecasters giving you an indication of when your next good window might be? It is only because we have focused our resources on this. We worked quite a lot. We knew it was not easy but it just went over the tipping point. We will start again in 80 hours from now. I am sure in a few days we will see another window and I hope this time it’s going to be the right one. OK, well, we look forward to seeing you next time. Thank you very much. Tens of thousands of people have lined the banks of the River Mersey in Liverpool to watch three cruise liners mark the 175th anniversary of the founding of the Cunard shipping line. The Queen Mary Two, the Queen Victoria and the Queen Elizabeth performed a series of manoeuvres on the river. The ships were joined by the RAF’s Red Arrows aerobatics team which roared over the Mersey to the delight of crowds streaming their trademark red, white and blue smoke. Alison Freeman reports from Liverpool. HORN SOUNDS. They queued for hours to see history in the making. The three Queens united to celebrate Liverpool’s key role in the creation of the cruise liner industry. The largest, the Queen Mary, had been docked here for a day, awaiting her two sister ships. The crowds were admiring her size and form. I am proud to be in Liverpool, proud to be a Scouser, and this is a once-in-a-lifetime. We both love coming to to see the ships and there is no better place to come than to Liverpool on a day like today. Look at the vastness of that ship, it’sjust magnificent. It was very impressive and the little boy couldn’t get over the size of it. He was very impressed, weren’t you? Yes. So there she goes, all 198,000 tons of metal. Queen Mary is going out into the Mersey to meet her two sisters there, the Queen Elisabeth and the Queen Victoria, for the very first time. HORN SOUNDS. The shipping line Cunard started 175 years ago with a transatlantic mail service. The luxury of the three Queens today are in sharp contrast to the past. Cunard moved its headquarters to Southampton in the 60s, but the Cunard building remains, as does Liverpool’s role as the company’s spiritual home. The Cunard building sits at the centre of the Three Graces, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The three Queens are performing a salute to those three graces this lunchtime, a Riverdance of regal proportions. Writers, comedians and poets from around the world are gathering in a small British town, for one of the world’s most famous literary gatherings. It’s the HAY Festival, where fans of the written word gather to listen, learn and discuss all sorts of books. Rebecca jones has been browsing through the event, and meeting some of the stars of this year’s show. There is no mistaking where we are, a place where tens of thousands of people come to rub shoulders with some of the world ‘s greatest thinkers, writers and performers. Let’s go and look around. This is the 28 Hay Festival. It was dreamt UP the 28 Hay Festival. It was dreamt up around a kitchen table in the 1980s. Look at it now. There are more than 700 events crammed into 11 days. When the former US president Bill Clinton came here, he described it as the Woodstock of the mind. Let’s listen to how the writer and comedian Stephen Fry sums up Hay. First, one of the stars of this year 's Festival, actorjude Law. Eccentric, moving, inspirational, fun, relaxing, stimulating. Hay is words, Hay is wonder, Hay is freedom, Hay is talk, Hay is Hay on wine. LAUGHS. The Hay Festival is to books or Glastonbury is the new The Glovers, this is the festival bookshop where you can buy books and get your book signed or perhaps meet your favourite author so here people are waiting to meet an author whose novel has been shortlisted for this year ‘s Bailey’s Women’s Prize for Fiction -- music lovers. What else draws people here? There are writers being interviewed on stage, from dawn till dusk. Loads of events for children and plenty of places to play it and to read. All part of this huge celebration of literature and ideas. Much more on all of the news on the BBC website. And you can get in touch with me and most of the team on Twitter. Thanks for watching. Bank Holiday Monday wasn’t spectacularly sunny but it was a dry day for many. That dry and cloudy theme will continue to Tuesday. Maybe drier during the day with few places seeing more sunshine. We will start with sunshine across eastern England but elsewhere a lot of loud and maybe one or two showers in parts of western Scotland. That will increase generally through the course of the morning and into the afternoon before it hopefully breaks up later on. ~ -- cloud. We could see some sunshine returning to parts of Wales and south-west England. There will be a lot of cloud over temperatures in the mid to high teens. 18-19 possible in the sun. Cloud developing across eastern England but there will be sunny spells as there will be across the south-west and Northern Ireland. Cou nty County Down in particular. Across Northern Ireland and the west of Scotland, quite a lot of cloud with brightness across eastern Scotland and showers possible in the west. Should be a dry day in Paris. Andy Murray is safely through to the second round. Sunny spells on Wednesday could see a high of 21 degrees. In the UK, still a few showers in the evening on Tuesday across the north-west. They will pick up as we go towards Wednesday morning. Elsewhere it will be a dry night with largely clear skies across the south with mist and fog possible. Temperatures widely down into single figures in towns and cities. CRural areas will be down to four or five degrees in some areas. A fresh start on Wednesday with sunny spells in the south at first. Eastern areas staying phone through the day. Still some showers in northwest Scotland and wet in Northern Ireland by the end of the morning. This rain will trickle into other western areas during the day and the winds will pick up. Feeling cool in Glasgow, nine or ten. Brightness in the south-east means we could reach up to 20 Celsius. Wet weather in the west is from an area of low pressure which will dominate our weather from Thursday and Friday. Many isobars on the charts and the winds picking up. Bringing sunshine but plenty of showers to end the week. They will get quite lively on Thursday with some hail and thunder mixed in cross the north and west and a cool breeze blowing. Parts of the south not seeing too many showers, with some sunny spells. In the capital, temperatures cool for the time year. Winds will ease by Friday with not as many showers in the afternoon but it is another day with some sunshine and quite a few downpours. Goodbye. As India looks set for two more weeks of scorching heat, authorities have urged people to stay indoors and drink plenty of fluids. Nearly 500 people have died in the heatwave. Most deaths have happened in the southern states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. A powerful tornado has swept through northern Mexico, killing more than a dozen people and causing widespread destruction. Most of the confirmed deaths are in a Mexican border city of Ciudad Acuna. Around 300 people have been taken to hospital, and several 100 homes have been destroyed. Severe weather has hit the south-west of the United States. In Texas, three people are known to have died - and another twelve are reported missing after their holiday home was swept away by floodwater. The governor there has said that the flooding is the worst the state has ever seen. Detectives hunting a man suspected of killing three members of a family in Didcot - have discovered his body. Thames Valley Police said 21-year-old jed Allen’s body was found in a wooded area in Oxford. Now on BBC News all the latest business news live from Singapore. The head of the World Trade Organisation says deadlocked trade talks can be revived. They want it done. Clearly, each one of them wants it done their way, which is not going to happen, so I think that at this point in time, at least they are sitting at the table. Indonesia aims to build one million homes to rehouse the poor. Welcome and thank you forjoining us. As the World Trade Organisation marks its 20th year in existence, the global body is at a tipping point. The so-called Doha round of trade negotiations has been deadlocked since 2008, just as an increasing number of regional and bilateral trade deals are making progress. Now the countdown has begun to try to get Doha restarted and the head of the WTO says he is confident that finally a deal can be done. We asked whether the organisation will still be relevant in another 20 years. Even more so because the world is getting more interconnected than ever and there are a number of those problems in terms of international trade that can only be solved multilaterally. Clearly, for example, the case of subsidies, agricultural subsidies or domestic subsidies. You do not deal with those bilaterally - it’s impossible. You have to do it multilaterally. But has the job been taken over by these other multilateral agreements over many countries? But they don’t and can’t address these issues. For example, regulations on telecommunications and other kinds of services. All those things can only be done multilaterally because you cannot do it for... Like a trade facilitation. Either you facilitate trade at the border for everybody else or you don’t because you can’t do it just for one country. Each country, each import, you cannot treat them differently. You say that more progress needs to be made. Indeed, the WTO is not a dynamic organisation. What makes you confident that now things will change? In 2008, you were stuck. In 2015, you say it’s all good? Not everything is good. I think that we now know we can do things. Look, when I got there about two years ago, nobody believed we would do the trade facilitation agreement. The text was. .. We had something like 300-400 brackets around the text and we had just three months to get there and we did it. Why was that? Because what we really need is the will of the members to do it? Is the will really there now? I think it is. I think people all value the system for different reasons and different purposes but they all value the system and they all want the system. They want it done. Clearly, each one of them wants it done their way but that is not going to happen, so I think at this point in time, at least they are sitting at the table. They are migrating towards more of a solutions framework. ""OK, so you won’t do that? Fine. ""I won’t insist on this anymore, but maybe we can do something else."" This something else, this search for the something else, that was not there before. Since 2008, people have not been looking for the something else. And now they are. Doha is not dead? Certainly, it is not dead. But it is up to the members. Then they have to decide whether they can or cannot. What cannot happen is to have negotiations on so many different issues being held hostage. We have to figure out whether we can do it or not and if we cannot do it, then what? What is the next dead? How do we make this work? The director-general of the WTO. Singapore’s economy expanded in the last quarter from the previous year despite a contraction in the manufacturing industry. It grew a 2.6%. Growth in construction helped offset the falls in transport, engineering, electronics and biomedical manufacturing. Inputs are down in the Philippines according to the latest trade data. -- imports. The country’s exports are expected to remain healthy. The Philippines provides 10% of the world ‘s’s Semiconductor Manufacturing services. Investors are Manufacturing services. Investors are worried a slowdown in luxury sales in China could prove to be a drag on earnings. One industry analyst summed up the challenges earlier. Definitely yes. I think it is very clear. We have seen profitability in China going down. It contributes about 25%. They have reduced the pressing of spare parts. Apart from the government clamping down on corruption, which has hurt luxury items, has the discontinuation of the Land Rover and the introduction of the new model also impacted sales? I think the major reason is we have anticorruption campaigns. But yes, these were the old models. That is one of the reasons. The domestic market which is led by the Nano is also going through tough times. Going forward, how do you think they can turn around its sales numbers at home and overseas? The only secret to success is you to introduce new products, especially in a market like India were most companies are coming out of global products. I think data has to follow the same path, to get a very good bargain In Indonesia, only around 60% of people live in appropriate housing but the government has plans to change all of that with an ambitious programme to try to build one million homes before the end of the year. Aimed at people on low incomes, there are still big challenges. Skyscrapers and big houses, a sign of Indonesia’s growing economy. But not everyone enjoys a decent life. Wirtan is a fisherman injakarta. He has been living in this house for around 40 years because he cannot afford anywhere else. TRANSLATION: Sometimes I can catch fish but often I don’t, so I don’t have any money. He is one of an estimated 100 million Indonesians living in poor accommodation. To try to solve this problem, the Indonesian government has set itself the goal of building one million houses within a year for people on low incomes such as farmers, fishermen and labourers. Progress here is slow but the plan is to spread the houses across all of the country’s 34 provinces by the end of the year. The government says it will cost around $6 billion to build the houses injust 12 months. With a loan from the Asian Development Bank, the authorities are optimistic the project will be a success. We are optimistic that this project will be completed because our investors are committed to our programme. But projects like this are not new. Around eight years ago, the Indonesian government tried to implement a similar programme by building these low-cost apartments. But many purchasers did not hold onto them for long. They made big money selling them on the open market, earning up to treble the opening price. The buyers claimed to be poor people and they had the financial facility of low interest rates. The government is considering what rules they can put in place to stop profit-takers from gaining an unfair advantage. Even if there are strict regulations, the challenge will be enforcing them. Still, many hope the housing project goes ahead and is not abandoned. While Wirtan does not want to move away from the water and his fishing boats, he does want better accommodation. My house only has one window. It does not have electricity. I need a proper house. He is one of millions of Indonesians who want the same thing. Asian stock markets are mixed at this hour. Sydney is in positive territory. Thank you for investing time with us. Goodbye for now. The top stories this hour. As India looks set for two more weeks of scorching heat, the government urges people working outside to take extra precautions. Nearly 500 people have died in the heatwave. A tornado has ripped through the Mexican border city of Acuna - severe weather has killed at least a dozen people. Detectives looking for a man suspected of killing his younger sister, mother and her partner had discovered his body in Oxford. Police had been searching for the 21-year-old man since his family members were found dead at their home in Didcot on Saturday. This was where the search for jed Allen came to an end. An area of woodland in Oxford, 50 miles or so where tragedy had unfolded 48 hours earlier. just before five o’clock this evening, members of the public reported finding the body of a man in a wooded area in Oxford. While no formal identification has taken place, I am satisfied that this is the body ofjed Allen, who I previously named as a suspect in this investigation. Residents say it is a busy area, popular withjoggers and dog walkers. I am quite shocked. It is quite a distance to get here. How come they didn’t widen the search area? Police had released the last recorded sighting of jed Allen alive, CCTV of him shopping at a railway station at six o’clock on Saturday evening. 2.5 hours later, the bodies of his sister, his mother and her partner were discovered. They had been stabbed to death. The search for the 21-year-old had covered most of the city. It was centred on parklands at Oxford University, where Mr Allen worked as a groundsman. While the policemen were looking for her brother, classmates of his sister were dealing with what had happened. None of us wanted to tell the kids what happened. We were trying to hide it. Today it is good. It has been a way of breaking it to them. Better than adults crying. Do you think the children understand what has happened? Not really. They know she is not coming back to school. We discussed that. We cannot discuss the details. They cannot understand it and they should not have to. The head teacher says the school and the community as a whole is heartbroken. How do you begin to comprehend such an awful tragedy? She was a very sweet, happy, precious little child. Ifjed Allen did kill three people, including his sister and mother, nobody can explain why. The police investigation may be over, but many questions remain. Hello, I’m Nick Marshall-McCormack and this is Sport Today from the BBC sport centre. Coming up: Paying the price for a bare trophy cabinet. Real Madrid fire coach Carlo Ancelotti. It’s party time in Istanbul for Galatasaray fans as they celebrate their 20th Turkish title. And a man of the match performance from Ben Stokes guides England to victory over New Zealand. Hello, wherever you are around the world, welcome to Sport Today. Real Madrid President Florentino Perez has sacked Carlo Ancelotti as he looks to give the Spanish giants ""fresh impetus"". The time has come for a change in direction that will allow us to reach our pick of a new era. -- peak. Ancelotti had one year left on his contract but became the fall guy for a season without any major silverware. That came after a brilliant 2014 where he led Real to a record-extending tenth European crown and a Kings Cup triumph in Spain. But this season, they were eliminated in the Champions League semi-finals byjuventus and beaten in the Spanish league by Barcelona. I spoke to Spanish football expert juan Castro for his analysis. After the juventus defeat, Carlo Ancelotti was in the street as we say. There was no possibility for him to continue because the president, Perez, thinks that it was already his final time in Real Madrid. The president said it was time to get fresh impetus. Where will he go for that? Rafa Benitez obviously top of the list. Yes. He is right now the number one. The president has said two things, that the new coach has to speak Spanish - Benitez is Spanish and was born professionally for Real Madrid and the second thing is that the new coach will be presented in two weeks time. Benitez still has to complete one week more with Napoli. We are already talking about conteders to replace Carlo Ancelotti but where now for the man of such enormous pedigree? Where does he go now? He has said there were only two possibilities. He will stay in Real Madrid or he will go to rest for a year. As juan Castro mentioned, Rafa Benitez is top of the list. He is out of contract with Napoli. And the BBC understands he’s in advanced negotiations. Former Borussia Dortmund coach jurgen Klopp is in the mix. Then there is Zinedine Zidane. The Galactico is already part of the coaching staff at the Bernabeu and is highly favoured by president Perez. We will keep you right up to date on BBC. That’s as we find out any information as to who will be Carlo action ~ information as to who will be Carlo -- and the -- Carlo Ancelotti ‘s replacement. Roma have secured automatic Champions League qualification in Serie A, after beating Lazio 2-1. 55,000 packed Stadio Olympico for the Rome derby to see Roma come out on top and take second place in the league. Lazio finish third and now go into the Champions League play-off round. Galatasaray are Turkish league champions for a record 20th time. They secured the title after bitter rivals Fenerbahce could only draw 2-2 against Istanbul Basaksehiras. It was an ugly game where Fenerbache had four players sent off. So Galatasaray fans took to the streets and lit their flares as they celebrated an unassailable five-point lead at the top of the table with one match to play. It’s Galatasaray’s third title in the last four seasons. Norwich fans, welcome back to the English Premier League! The Canaries won the most lucrative match in football, the Championship Playoff against Middlesbrough at Wembley. Lucrative because they are about to get the premiership riches again. Norwich manager, Alex Neil, said it was all about his team having self-belief. They were relegated last season and returned with a 2-0 win. There was always a risk, at 2-0, of having the most dangerous score line in football but we showed fantastic determination and a desire to get where we believed we should be. It is not being arrogant, we have a fantastic group of players and an unbelievable manager and hopefully Norwich will continue to grow. England captain Alistair Cook said ""it’s one of the best matches"" he’s ""ever been involved in"" after his side beat New Zealand in a thrilling first cricket test at Lord’s. New Zealand were set a target of 345 for victory on Monday after England’s Ben Stokes had hit the fastest test century at Lords on day four. He then took three wickets to help bowl-out the Black Caps. England won by 124 runs. just a brilliant day. A brilliant Test match from both sides, really. Played in a brilliant spirit and highly competitive but in the right way. We were lucky to come out with the right results and full credit to them for the way they played. To England’s credit, they were too good for us in crucial stages of the Test match but I’m still really proud of the achievements of our guys and the way that we kept giving throughout the Test match. I thought it was a fantastic match to be a part of. To play five days in front of full houses at Lord’s and for it to come down to the final ten overs is a testament to what a good match it was. When you stand at a cricket ground where the sport has been played forever 200 years, it is a boast to say that this is one of the best matches Lord’s has ever seen but it was a record-breaking test match and one that until past six o’clock local time. There were stunning individual performances on both sides but especially for England with the Captain Alastair Cook giving calm leadership on the final day which shows he is back in form. Ben Stokes, even more so. England have in him a kind of Flintoff, Botham figurehead now to keep attention going in the sport which is a good talking point especially in this country. What wickets they were. Kane Williamson and then Nathan McCullum. The second test begins injust a few days time at Headingley but England, who say that they have proved the virtue of the team and mutual trust, this is a hard-fought victory. Australia’s Trevor Bayliss is now the frontrunner for the vacant England coaching job afterjason Gillespie revealed he is out of the running. Bayliss was Sri Lanka’s coach when they reached the 2011 World Cup final. The former Australia fast bowler Gillespie had been regarded as the favourite to replace the recently-sacked Peter Moores.

Reigning French Open champion Maria Sharapova has a cough and a cold and there were none of her usual shouts of ""c’mon!"". But the Russian opened her defence by grinding out a win over Estonian Kaia Kanepi. Tennis correspondent Russell Fuller was watching day 2 action for us at Roland Garros. Maria Sharapova’s first-round opponent looked to be her toughest challenge of this opening week. Kaia Kanepi, twice a quarterfinalist at Roland Garros has bags of experience and is a formidable opponent on her day yet Maria Sharapova took it in straight sets. It was a little bit of an anticlimax. Kanepi served a double fault one match point down. Disappointment when Maria Sharapova couldn’t speak to fans after that match. She has not been feeling very well and didn’t think her voice would be strong enough but said it should not hold her back for the rest of the fortnight. Agniezka Radwanska’s desperate 2015 continues as she lost a deciding set to Annika Beck of Germany, 6-1, so she’s out in the very first round. Venus Williams also was beaten today but she has had a really tough first-round draw against her fellow American Sloane Stephens. In the men’s competition, we lost the elventh seed Feliciano Lopez.

Maybe drier during the day with a few more places seeing more sunshine. We will start with sunshine across eastern England Elsewhere a lot of cloud and maybe one or two showers in parts of western Scotland. Cloud will increase generally through the course of the morning and into the afternoon before it hopefully breaks up later on. We could see some sunshine returning to parts of Wales and south-west England. Overall, though, there will be a lot of cloud. Temperatures in the mid to high teens. 18-19 possible in the sun.

Welcome to BBC News - broadcasting at home and around the globe. Our top stories. Nearly 500 people have died in a heatwave in India - and the extreme temperatures could go on for another two weeks. A tornado rips through the Mexican border city of Acuna - severe weather has killed at least a dozen people. We’re on the frontline with Shia militias in Iraq’s Anbar province as they try to fight back against Islamic State. Around the world in 50 years. We need to get out in kiss all the excitement attracts mortar fire. And three queens in formation - tens of thousands line the banks of the Mersey to mark 175 years of the Cunard shipping line. Hello. A heatwave sweeping India has killed more than 500 people - most of the deaths are in the southern states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. With temperatures reaching 48 Celsius, 118 Fahrenheit, authorities are urging people to stay indoors and drink plenty of water. Ben Bland reports. As temperatures soar throughout India, people seek shade wherever they can. Exhausted by the extreme heat, others cool off in whatever way possible. In Kolkata in the east, drivers of the iconic yellow taxis have been urged by their unions to stay off the roads during the hottest hours. But some people were doing their best to carry on with business as usual. Despite warnings to drink plenty of water and stay indoors, so far as many as 500 people have died because of the heat. The worst affected states are Andhra Pradesh and Telangana in the south but across the country, the heatwave is expected to continue well into the coming week. Recently, we have had 48 degrees and we will keep these levels for the next few days. It is notjust the heat during the day that is dangerous but at night as well. The next few days will have the highest temperatures again across northern parts of India and severe heatwave warnings across the north-western plains. Until the monsoon rains bring cooler temperatures, there are fears the heatwave could yet claim more lives. Alex Deakin from the BBC’s weather centre says even for India these temperatures are exceptional. It is hotter this time of year. Temperatures are widely over 40 Celsius. We are seeing temperatures pushing the high 40s. Maybe as high as 50 degrees, 122 Fahrenheit. These are as much as 10 degrees above average. Significantly above normal. And people are not getting any respite at night. That is one of the health issues. You can almost put up with high temperatures during the day. At the moment, temperatures are above by day and night. There is no relief. If this goes on, it puts a lot of pressure on the body, particularly for the more vulnerable members of society. What is the latest? Is it going to go on? The prognosis is not great. Temperatures will remain above average by a number of degrees. It looks like it will go on at least a week. It depends where you are in India as to what time the monsoon arrives. It is scheduled to arrive sometime next week. It depends where you are. And even people in India are finding this unusual. Exactly. Itjust goes to show. It gets hotter at this time of year in India. It shows how unusually hot that heat is. It could continue to cause issues. A powerful tornado has swept through northern Mexico, killing at least 16 people and causing widespread destruction. Most of the confirmed deaths are in a Mexican border city of Ciudad Acuna, which was hit by winds of up to 185 miles an hour. Elaine jung has more. Street after street, the destruction laid bare, hundreds of homes torn apart. Vehicles resting against homes and roofs. Seven blocks left devastated by the tornado. More than 1000 homes affected, leaving many with nowhere to go. All this from a tornado sweeping through at speeds of up to 300 kilometres per hour. It lasted six seconds. In the aftermath, bodies were found scattered across neighbourhoods. Residents clearly shellshocked and grieving the sudden loss of loved ones. Striking the northern Mexico border city of Ciudad Acuna, home to 136,000 people, the powerful tornado was a first for this town, built more than a century ago. As locals pick through the pieces, the desperate search for survivors continues. China’s state media is reporting that a fire at a rest home has killed 38 people and injured six others. The fire swept through an apartment building in Pingdingshan city in Henan province. Two of the injured are said to be in a serious condition. The cause of the fire is unknown. The British Prime Minister, David Cameron and the president of the European Commission, jean-Claude juncker, have met to discuss plans to renegotiate Britain’s membership of the EU. Mr Cameron is due to visit several European capitals this week, to try to drum up support for his plans. The Conservative government has promised an in-out referendum by the end of 2017. An Air France plane has been escorted to New York’s jFK Airport Two Hong Kong government officials charged over the city’s worst maritime disaster in four decades, are to go on trial. 39 people died when a passenger ferry collided with a pleasure boat off Lamma Island in October 2012. The captains of both vessels have already been tried - one was convicted of manslaughter and jailed for eight years, the other for nine months. An Air France plane has been escorted to New York’s jFK Airport by US fighterjets, following an anonymous call claiming there were chemical weapons on board. Two F-16 fighters were scrambled to shadow the plane which was en route to the US from Paris. The FBI confirmed passengers had disembarked safely and no dangerous substances had been found. Earlier this month militants from Islamic State seized the Iraqi city of Ramadi. Its fall was seen as a major capitulation by the Iraqi Army in the strategically important Anbar Province. Since then, Iraqi government forces, backed by Shia militia, have been mobilising there, to try to take the fight to IS. Our World Affairs Editorjohn Simpson travelled with a group of Shia militias to the town of Garma, about halfway between Baghdad and Ramadi. Anbar province. Vast, empty, basically desert, and natural territory for IS. It has been the battleground for years. The Americans built fortifications when they wear here. Now, as then, the enemy’s weapon of choice is the roadside bomb. We reach Garma as the government forces are firing at Islamic State’s last positions in the town. IS has been forced out of the rest of it. We are with a so-called popular mobilisation unit, a militia mostly composed of Shia Muslims commanded by Sheik Ali Dehish, a dapper character in a uniform of his own devising. The militias are the only government troops who seem able to resist Islamic State’s ferocity. But Anbar province is Sunni Muslim. Is there a danger that the sheik’s men will fight a sectarian war here? TRANSLATION: I carry the flag of Iraq, because I do notjust represent Shia or Sunni. I represent the whole of Iraq. This is what they call the frontline in the sense that it is the closest that the Iraqi forces get to the last remaining Islamic State positions. just on the other side of that ridge there. Mostly, the fire is outgoing. There aren’t that many Islamic State fighters left. But they’ve just told us we have to get out in case all the excitement attracts incoming mortar fire. And Islamic State’s by no means finished in Anbar province. Another BBC team travelling with the Iraqi army came under fire from IS and a battle starting. It is one of the characteristics of fighting a war in Anbar that you scarcely ever get a look at your enemy. It’s a matter of life and death for the Iraqi government to drive Islamic State out of Anbar. The government believes it can be done and by the end of the year. Western diplomats are inclined to agree. But it will be an immense task. More than 100,000 people have left the country of Burundi. They fear the coup against the President could plunge the country back in the civil war. They say it is not to do with the ethnic conflict ten years ago. They are still fleeing in their thousands. Ruby and heading abroad to escape the country and political crisis. It is not the first time. This is a nation with a history of ethnic violence. On this occasion, many say they have been threatened by supporters of Ruby’s governing party. They told us, they will wash us. They say they will get rid of the diet. A mean they will kill everyone not supporting the party in power. There have been weeks of protests in Burundi’s capital against the President. And his plans to run for a controversial third term in office. The man himself has tried to project a sense of calm with a game of football in the capital. The president survived a coup attempt last week. He says he will not step down. His aides have explicitly blamed Burundi’s ethnic Tutsi minority. There is some ethnic element that is underground, as you were saying. Because it is quite surprising that some pockets of the capital which I Tutsi dominated by these ones. But the protesters insist this is not about ethnicity. They are saying that there are tootsies, there are Hutus. They are divided by the politicians, trying to divide them. That is not what they are saying. A decade of peace has changed this country. The focus is on party politics now, not ethnicity. The governing pa rtyg rowi ng ethnicity. The governing partygrowing authoritarianism. Opposition leaders say they are being threatened, independent media silenced. They say the President is desperate and cowardly. I might say just some coward politicians may try to rely on ethnicity within this crisis. But ethnicity has nothing to do with this. And those politicians will not succeed? They will not. They will not inflame the past? They will try to do so, but they will be defeated. Perhaps. But as the protests continue, so it is the uncertainty. Ruby’s political crisis could turn into something much uglier. Stay with us on BBC News - still to come. We’re in a small British town for a world famous literary gathering. First though the stories making newspaper headlines around the world. The Asian edition of the Wall Street journal reflects on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s first year in office. He’s allowed more foreign investment in railways and defence, but on other key fronts the paper suggests he’s moved less decisively, frustrating investors who hoped for bolder change. According to China Daily, import taxes on some popular goods, such as suits, furs and skin products, are to be cut by around 50%, to encourage Chinese people to spend more money at home, rather than buy abroad. The US edition of the Financial Times reports Chinese officials are being sent to visit their shamed former colleagues in prison, in the hope they’ll be scared into abiding by the law and refusing bribes. The UN nuclear watchdog has criticised japanese authorities for not preventing the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011. It says weaknesses were not fully assessed. That’s in the japan Times. This is BBC News. The latest headlines: As India looks set for two more weeks of scorching heat, the government urges people working outside to take extra precautions. Nearly 500 people have died in the heatwave. A tornado has ripped through the Mexican border city of Acuna. Severe weather has killed at least a dozen people. At least three people have died in flash flooding in Texas in the United States. Another twelve are reported missing after their holiday home was swept away by floodwater. Some areas saw up to 10 inches of rain over a 24-hour period. Hundreds of homes have been destroyed. The state governor said it was the worst flooding Texas has seen. jason Whitely - Senior Reporter for ABC’s WFAA - TV in Dallas, has the latest details. Right now behind us is a river in Dallas, Texas and the water is normally in a narrow channel through the city but you can tell behind us that so much water has spilt out. It is still inside the levies but it is quite a sight to see for people around here. Elsewhere in the state governor and others call this catastrophic flooding. It has killed five people in this state and eight or so are missing. Between eight and 12. It is a very serious and frightening situation. It is something many people here say they have never seen before. And I guess with Memorial Day they would have been a lot of people coming to stay in homes along the river. A very unlucky choice as it turned out. Absolutely, the area in central taxes where those families were washed away is a very popular area, in fact, people from the state go to that area. The Blanco river rose 26 feetin that area. The Blanco river rose 26 feet in 24 hours, that’s how high their water came when the storm set on the above us. People were vacationing in the holiday area for the vacation weekend as it winds up, without an idea that this was coming, people were literally washed away in the middle of the night. It has rained for so long now it looks like it will go on for quite a while. How does it compare with the records? This is the fourth wettest May in Texas history, it has rained 19 out of the last 25 days. We really haven’t seen the sun a lot in the state in this month. And unfortunately, forecasters said it will continue at least until the end of the month. The seven-day forecast in Dallas and many other parts of the state doesn’t look good. We have seen extraordinary scenes. At one stage there were cars going come the river, in some cases upside down, however, I gather some people have managed to get out but unfortunately it has claimed some people’s lies. Unfortunately, that is the case. What we don’t see a lot of in Texas and the US is Ridgers washed out at the storm cell that came through this holiday weekend washed multiple bridges out, it washed roads out and that’s what caused some of the loss of life. Fortunately, people are smart. They followed the same, turnaround, don’t drown. Sometimes the water doesn’t look deep and people decide to go through it and meet with unfortunate circumstances. Writers, comedians and poets from around the world are gathering in a small British town, for one of the world’s most famous literary gatherings. It’s the HAY Festival, where fans of the written word gather to listen, learn and discuss all sorts of books. Rebecca jones has been browsing through the event, and meeting some There is no mistaking where we are, a place where tens of thousands of people come to rub shoulders with some of the world’s greatest thinkers, writers and performers. Let’s go and look around. This is the 28th Hay Festival. It was dreamt up around a kitchen table in the 1980s. Look at it now. There are more than 700 events crammed into 11 days. When the former US president Bill Clinton came here, he described it as the Woodstock of the mind. Let’s listen to how the writer and comedian Stephen Fry sums up Hay. First, one of the stars of this year’s festival, actorjude Law. Eccentric, moving, inspirational, fun, relaxing, stimulating. Hay is words, Hay is wonder, Hay is freedom, Hay is talk, Hay is Hay on wine. LAUGHS. The Hay Festival is to books what Glastonbury is to music lovers. This is the festival bookshop where you can buy books and get your book signed, or perhaps meet your favourite author, so here people are waiting to meet an author whose novel has been shortlisted for this year’s Bailey’s Women’s Prize for Fiction. What else draws people here? There are writers being interviewed on stage from dawn till dusk. Loads of events for children and plenty of places to play it and to read. All part of this huge celebration of literature and ideas. No matter how much globetrotting you’ve done you’re unlikely to be as well travelled as Albert Podell. He’s the only American to have visited every single country in the world. That’s more than 190 nations. He’s written a book, called Around the World in 50 Years - and he spoke to the BBC about his experiences. MY My philosophy in travelling is usually that the worst things happen, the better the story is going to be. I have gone to every country in the world and have written a book on it called Around the World in 50 Years, my adventure to every country on earth. My parents were very poor and we never travelled at all when I was a kid. At the age of six, I started collecting stamps and I wanted a stamp from every country in the world. But I was fascinated by these little bits of coloured paper they had of alpacas and llamas and mountains and lakes and strange looking people. And I thought it would be really cool to get out there and see all these people and that’s probably what inspired it way back. The first trip I took, the one I took in 1965 and 1966 was to drive around the world. The way we did that, we drove closer to the equator. And it took us 19 months and we set that record. So, somewhere along the way the idea kind of crept in, why not go to every country? I was up to 90, 196, through the actuarial table and I thought, why not? I will see if I can go to every country in the world. Nothing great and glorious, just, why not? People mostly thought it was crazy, they thought there were better things to do in life and mostly people thought it was impossible because there were just too many problems, too many civil wars, big wars, revolutions. Ithink it’s fair to call it an obsession, you could call it a dedication, you could call it a mission. I had purchased a temporary ticket to go to Scotland when I thought it was going to become a country. I would actually like that. My plan would be to go there the day it became independent and then I would note that I was the only person in the world who had been to every country -- know. The advice I would give is see a good psychiatrist Thomas E a good life insurance agency, make out a pretty good will, read all the books and see all the movies you want because you may never get another chance -- see a good psychiatrist, get a good. And once you get on the road, enjoy it as much as you can. Tens of thousands of people have lined the banks of the River Mersey in Liverpool to watch three cruise liners mark the 175th anniversary of the founding of the Cunard shipping line. The Queen Mary Two, the Queen Victoria and the Queen Elizabeth performed a series of manoeuvres on the river. The ships were joined by the RAF’s Red Arrows aerobatics team which roared over the Mersey to the delight of crowds streaming their trademark red, white and blue smoke. Alison Freeman reports from Liverpool. HORN SOUNDS. They queued for hours to see history in the making. The three Queens united to celebrate Liverpool’s key role in the creation of the cruise liner industry. The largest, the Queen Mary, had been docked here for a day, awaiting her two sister ships. The crowds were admiring her size and form. I am proud to be in Liverpool, proud to be a Scouser, and this is a once-in-a-lifetime. We both love coming to to see the ships and there is no better place to come than to Liverpool on a day like today. Look at the vastness of that ship, it’sjust magnificent. It was very impressive and the little boy couldn’t get over the size of it. He was very impressed, weren’t you? Yes. So there she goes, all 198,000 tons of metal. Queen Mary is going out into the Mersey to meet her two sisters there, the Queen Elisabeth and the Queen Victoria, for the very first time. HORN SOUNDS. The shipping line Cunard started 175 years ago with a transatlantic mail service. The luxury of the three Queens today are in sharp contrast to the past. Cunard moved its headquarters to Southampton in the 60s, but the Cunard building remains, as does Liverpool’s role as the company’s spiritual home. The Cunard building sits at the centre of the Three Graces, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The three Queens are performing a salute to those three graces this lunchtime, a Riverdance of regal proportions. Do you have a sweet tooth? Maybe not sweetener for this.

Goodbye. ~ With India set for two more weeks of unusually ferocious heat, authorities have urged people to stay indoors and drink plenty of fluids. At least 500 people have died in the heatwave, most in the southern states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Temperatures have been reaching 48 Celsius. That’s 118 Fahrenheit. A powerful tornado has swept through northern Mexico, killing more than a dozen people and causing widespread destruction. Most of the confirmed deaths are in the Mexican border city of Ciudad Acuna. Several hundred homes have been destroyed in a matter of seconds and around 300 people have been taken to hospital. Severe weather has hit the south-west of the United States. In Texas, three people are known to have died and another 12 are reported missing after their holiday home was swept away by floodwater. The governor there has said that the flooding is the worst the state has ever seen. Detectives looking for a man suspected of killing his young sister, his mother and her partner have discovered his body in Oxford. Police had been searching for jed Allen, who was 21, since his family members were found dead at their home in Didcot on Saturday. The three bodies were found with stab wounds. Now on BBC News, all the latest business news, live from Singapore. The head of the World Trade Organisation says deadlocked trade talks can be revived. They want it done. Clearly, each one of them wants it done their way, which is not going to happen, so I think that at this point in time, at least they are sitting at the table. Ambitious plans. Indonesia aims to build one million homes to rehouse the poor. Welcome and thank you forjoining us. As the World Trade Organisation marks its 20th year in existence, the global body is at a tipping point. The so-called Doha round of trade negotiations has been deadlocked since 2008, just as an increasing number of regional and bilateral trade deals are making progress. Now the countdown has begun to try to get Doha restarted and the head of the WTO says he is confident that finally a deal can be done. We asked whether the organisation will still be relevant in another 20 years. Even more so because the world is getting more interconnected than ever and there are a number of those problems in terms of international trade that can only be solved multilaterally. Clearly, for example, the case of subsidies, agricultural subsidies or domestic subsidies. You do not deal with those bilaterally - it’s impossible. You have to do it multilaterally. But hasn’t the job been taken over by these other multilateral agreements over many countries? But they don’t and can’t address these issues. For example, regulations on telecommunications and other kinds of services. All those things can only be done multilaterally because you cannot do it for... Like a trade facilitation. Either you facilitate trade at the border for everybody else or you don’t because you can’t do it just for one country. Each country, each import, you cannot treat them differently. You say that more progress needs to be made. Indeed, the WTO is not a dynamic organisation. What makes you confident that now things will change? In 2008, you were stuck. In 2015, you say it’s all good? Not everything is good. I think that we now know we can do things. Look, when I got there about two years ago, nobody believed we would do the trade facilitation agreement. The text was. .. We had something like 300-400 brackets around the text and we had just three months to get there and we did it. Why was that? Because what we really need is the will of the members to do it? Is the will really there now? I think it is. I think people all value the system for different reasons and different purposes but they all value the system and they all want the system. They want it done. Clearly, each one of them wants it done their way but that is not going to happen, so I think at this point in time, at least they are sitting at the table. They are migrating towards more of a solution-finding mode. ""OK, so you won’t do that? Fine. ""I won’t insist on this anymore, but maybe we can do something else."" This something else, this search for the something else, that was not there before. Since 2008, people have not been looking for the something else. And now they are. Doha is not dead? Certainly, it is not dead. But it is up to the members. Then they have to decide whether they can or cannot. What cannot happen is to have negotiations on so many different issues being held hostage. We have to figure out whether we can do it or not and if we cannot do it, then what? What is the next dead? -- step? How do we make this work? The director-general of the WTO. We re Were Narendra Modi became Prime Minister of India a year ago, investors were optimistic that he could become the most business friendly reader India has ever known. -- when Narendra Modi. Stock prices rose to record high levels but the rally quickly lost momentum. Today, we get the latest report from Tata Motors. Narendra Modi stormed to power with hope of an economic revival. The jury is still out as to whether he lived up to expectations. Certainly. In terms of absolute numbers, we have seen economic growth picked up slightly. Inflation has moderated in India, certainly. A lot of this depends on global factors like oil prices. And his government has made moves to try and make it easier to do business in India. Has much changed on the ground? Thejury is India. Has much changed on the ground? The jury is still out on that. Yesterday, I was speaking with the head of a multinational company operating in India and I asked him that question and he said that on all of his foreign visits, people can at least name the Prime Minister of India. However, on the ground, it is still going to take a while to change the bureaucracy and get infrastructure set up. That has not happened just yet. You mentioned GDP growth. It was between 6.5% and 8.2% last year, which is better than China, but it is not trickling down to the businesses like Tata Motors, which will release reports today. The results are expected to be muted. One reason for that is that two years ago we had auto sales falling in India and that was after ten years of robust growth. That was because people were not certain whether their salaries would rise or not. We have seen that starting to dig up again but it is not as much as a company like Tata Motors needed. They relied heavily on sales of jaguar needed. They relied heavily on sales ofjaguar Land Rover. They needed. They relied heavily on sales of jaguar Land Rover. They are also in a transition phase, phasing out all models and bringing in new ones. Briefly, what are your expectations for the next 365 days from Narendra Modi? Thank you for updating us. We are experiencing some connection problems. Singapore’s economy expanded in the last quarter from the previous year despite a contraction in the manufacturing industry. It grew 2.6%. Growth in construction helped offset the falls in transport, engineering, electronics and biomedical manufacturing. Imports to the Philippines fell by their lowest levels in nine months. The country revealed a trade deficit from the january to March quarter of $1.44 billion. The country’s exports are expected to remain healthy, especially the semiconductor industry. The Philippines provides about 10% of the world’s semiconductor manufacturing services. In Indonesia, only around 60% of people live in appropriate housing but the government has plans to change all of that with an ambitious programme to try to build one million homes before the end of the year. Aimed at people on low incomes, there are still big challenges. Wirtan is a fisherman injakarta. He has been living in this house for around 40 years because he cannot afford anywhere else. TRANSLATION: Sometimes I can catch fish but often I don’t, so I don’t have any money. Wirto is one of an estimated 100 million Indonesians living in poor accommodation. To try to solve this problem, the Indonesian government has set itself the goal of building one million houses within a year for people on low incomes such as farmers, fishermen and labourers. The government says it will cost around $6 billion to build the houses injust 12 months. We are still lacking money but we are optimistic this project will be completed because our investors are committed to our programme. But projects like this are not new. Around eight years ago, the Indonesian government tried to implement a similar programme by building these low-cost apartments. But many purchasers did not hold onto them for long. They made big money selling them on the open market, earning up to triple the opening price. The buyers claimed to be poor people and they had the financial facility of low interest rates. Still, many hope the housing project goes ahead and is not abandoned. While Wirto does not want to move away from the water and his fishing boats, he does want better accommodation.

The top stories this hour: As India looks set for two more weeks of scorching heat, the government urges people working outside to take extra precautions. More than 500 people have died in the heatwave. Detectives looking for a man suspected of killing his younger sister, motherand her partner suspected of killing his younger sister, mother and her partner have discovered his body in Oxford. Police had been searching for the 21-year-old after his family members were found dead in their home in Didcot on Saturday. This was where the search for jed Allen came to an end. An area of woodland in Oxford, 50 miles or so where tragedy had unfolded 48 hours earlier. just before five o’clock this evening, members of the public reported finding the body of a man in a wooded area in Oxford. While no formal identification has taken place, I am satisfied that this is the body ofjed Allen, who I previously named as a suspect in this investigation. Residents say it is a busy area, popular withjoggers and dog walkers. I am quite shocked. It is quite a distance to get here. How come they didn’t widen the search area? Police had released the last recorded sighting of jed Allen alive, CCTV of him shopping at a railway station at six o’clock on Saturday evening. 2.5 hours later, the bodies of his sister, his mother and her partner were discovered. They had been stabbed to death. The search for the 21-year-old had covered most of the city. It was centred on parklands at Oxford University, where Mr Allen worked as a groundsman. While the policemen were looking for her brother, classmates of his sister were dealing with what had happened. None of us wanted to tell the kids what happened. We were trying to hide it. Today it is good. It has been a way of breaking it to them. Better than adults crying. Do you think the children understand what has happened? Not really. They know she is not coming back to school. We discussed that. We cannot discuss the details. They cannot understand it and they should not have to. The head teacher says the school and the community as a whole is heartbroken. How do you begin to comprehend such an awful tragedy? She was a very sweet, happy, precious little child. Ifjed Allen did kill three people, including his sister and mother, nobody can explain why. The police investigation may be over, but many questions remain. Time now for all the sports news in Sport Today. ~ Hello, I’m Nick Marshall-McCormack and this is Sport Today from the BBC sport centre. Coming up: Paying the price for a bare trophy cabinet. Real Madrid fire coach Carlo Ancelotti. It’s party time in Istanbul for Galatasaray fans as they celebrate their 20th Turkish title. And a man of the match performance from Ben Stokes guides England to victory over New Zealand. Hello, wherever you are around the world, welcome to Sport Today. Real Madrid President Florentino Perez has sacked Carlo Ancelotti as he looks to give the Spanish giants ""fresh impetus"". Ancelotti had one year left on his contract but became the fall guy for a season without any major silverware. That came after a brilliant 2014 where he led Real to a record-extending tenth European crown and a Kings Cup triumph in Spain. But this season, they were eliminated in the Champions League semi-finals byjuventus and beaten in the Spanish league by Barcelona. I spoke to Spanish football expert juan Castro for his analysis. After the defeat with juventus, Carlo Ancelotti was in the street as we say. There was no possibility for him to continue because the president, Perez, thinks that it was already his final time in Real Madrid. The president said it was time to get fresh impetus. Where will he go for that? Rafa Benitez is top of the list. He is right now the number one. The president has said two things, that the new coach has to speak Spanish, and Benitez is Spanish and has played professionally for Real Madrid and the second thing is that the new coach will be presented in two weeks time. Benitez still has to complete one week more with Napoli. We are already talking about competitors to replace Carlo Ancelotti but what about the man of such enormous pedigree? Where does he go now? He has said there were only two possibilities. He will stay in Real Madrid or he will go to rest for a year. Asjuan Castro mentioned Rafa Benitez is top of the list. He is out of contract with Napoli. And the BBC understands he’s in advanced negotiations. Then there is Zinedine Zidane. The Galactico is already part of the coaching staff at the Bernabeu and is highly favoured by president Perez. Former Borussia Dortmund coach jurgen Klopp is in the mix after a seven year stint with the German club. Much more on MUCi’I ITIOFE OI’! OUT Roma have secured automatic Champions League qualification in Serie A, after beating Lazio 2-1. 55,000 packed Stadio Olympico for the Rome derby to see Roma come out on top and take second place in the league. Lazio finish third and now go into the Champions League play-off round. Galatasaray are Turkish league champions for a record 20th time. They secured the title after bitter rivals Fenerbahce could only draw 2-2 against Istanbul Basaksehiras. It was an ugly game where Fenerbache had four players sent off. So Galatasaray fans took to the streets and lit their flares as they celebrated an unassailable five-point lead at the top of the table with one match to play. It’s Galatasaray’s third title in the last four seasons. And to Norwich fans, welcome back to the English Premier League! The Canaries won the most lucrative match in football, the Championship Playoff against Middlesbrough at Wembley. Norwich manager, Alex Neil said it was all about his team having self-belief. They were relegated last season and returned with a 2-0 win. There was always a risk of having the most dangerous score line in football but we showed fantastic determination and a desire to get where we believed we should be. It is not being arrogant, we have a fantastic group of players and an unbelievable manager and hopefully Norwich will continue to grow. England captain Alistair Cook said ""It’s one of the best matches"" he’s ""ever been involved in"" after his side beat New Zealand in a thrilling first cricket test at Lords. New Zealand were set a target of 345 for victory on Monday after England’s Ben Stokes had hit the fastest test century at Lords on day four. He then took three wickets to help bowl-out the Black Caps. England won by 124 runs. just a brilliant game. A brilliant test match from both sides, really. They played in a brilliant spirit and highly competitive but in the right way. We were lucky to come out with the right results and full credit to them for the way they played. To England ‘s credit, they were too good for us in crucial stages of the test match but I’m still really proud of the achievements of our guys and the way that we kept getting it through the test match. I thought it was a fantastic match to be a part of. To play five days in front of full houses at Lord’s and for it to come down to the final ten overs is a testament to what a good match it was. When you stand at a cricket ground where the sport has been played forever 200 years, it is audacious to say that this is one of the best matches Lord’s has ever seen, but it was a record-breaking test match and one that until past six o’clock local time. There were stunning individual performances on both sides but especially for England with the Captain Alastair Cook giving calm leadership on the final day which shows he is back in form. Ben Stokes, even more so. They have the kind of figureheads now to keep English attention going in the sport which is a good talking point especially in this country. What wickets they were. Kane Williamson and then Nathan McCullum. For New Zealand, the second test begins in just a few days time at Headingley but for England, who say that they have proved the virtue of the team and mutual trust, this is a hard-fought victory. Australia’s Trevor Bayliss is now the frontrunner for the vacant England coaching job afterjason Gillespie revealed he is out of the running. Bayliss was Sri Lanka’s coach when they reached the 2011 World Cup final. The former Australia fast bowler Gillespie had been regarded as the favourite to replace the recently-sacked Peter Moores. Gillespie said: ""I’ve spoken to Andrew Strauss and I’m not the preferred candidate, so that’s their call"". Reigning French Open champion Maria Sharapova has a cough and a cold and there were none of her usual shouts of ""c’mon!"". But the Russian opened her defence by grinding out a win over Estonian Kaia Kanepi. Tennis correspondent Russell Fuller was watching day 2 action for us at Roland Garros. Maria Sharapova ‘s first-round opponent looked to be her toughest challenge of this opening week. Kaia Kanepi, twice a quarterfinalist at Roland Garros has tons of experience and is a formidable opponent on her day yet Maria Sharapova took it in straight sets. It was a little bit of an anticlimax. Kanepi served a double fault when match point down. Disappointment when Maria Sharapova couldn’t speak to fans after that match. She has not been feeling very well and didn’t think her voice would be strong enough but said it should not hold her back for the rest of the fortnight. Agniezka Radwanska’s desperate 2015 continues as she lost a deciding set to Annika Beck of Germany, 6-1, so she’s out in the very first round. Venus Williams also was beaten today but she has had a really tough first-round draw against her fellow Americans Sloane Stephens. In the men’s competition, we lost the elventh seed Feliciano Lopez. But Andy Murray was one of the high-profile winners. Very easily indeed in straight sets against the Argentinian wildcard, Facundo Arguello. Look at the fear on Steph Curry ‘s face. The NBA’s MVP was checked for concussion during game format of Golden State Warriors versus Houston in their Western Conference playoffs but he is OK. The Rockets are leading in the third quarter. Team Sky cyclist Richie Porte has withdrawn injured from the Giro d’Italia. The Australian wants to focus on being fully fit to support Chris Froome in the Tour de France. He injured his knee and hip in a crash towards the end of Friday’s stage. Monday was a rest day on the Giro. Spain’s Alberto Contador has the overall lead.

See you soon. Bye bye. Bank Holiday Monday wasn’t spectacularly sunny but it was a dry day for many. That dry, rather cloudy theme will continue to Tuesday. Maybe drier during the day with a few more places seeing more sunshine. We will start with sunshine across eastern England. Elsewhere a lot of cloud and maybe one or two showers in parts of western Scotland. Cloud will increase generally through the course of the morning and into the afternoon before it hopefully breaks up later on. We could see some sunshine returning to parts of Wales and south-west England. Overall, though, there will be a lot of cloud. Temperatures in the mid to high teens. 18-19 possible in the sun. Cloud developing across eastern England but there will be sunny spells as there will be across the south-west of Northern Ireland. County Down in particular. Across Northern Ireland and the west of Scotland, quite a lot of cloud with brightness across eastern Scotland and showers possible in the west. Should be a dry day in Paris. Andy Murray is safely through to the second round. Sunny spells on Wednesday could see highs of 21 degrees. Back home across the UK, still a few showers in the evening on Tuesday across the north-west. They will pick up as we go towards Wednesday morning. Elsewhere it will be a dry night and with largely clear skies across the south, mist and fog possible. Temperatures widely down into single figures in towns and cities. Rural areas will be down to four or five degrees in some areas. A fresh start to Wednesday - sunny spells in the south at first. Eastern areas staying fine through the day. Still some showers in northwest Scotland and wet in Northern Ireland by the end of the morning. This rain will trickle into other western areas during the day and the winds will pick up. Feeling cool in Glasgow, nine or ten. With some brightness in the south-east, we could reach up to 20 Celsius. Wet weather in the west is from an area of low pressure which will dominate our weather from Thursday and Friday. Lots of isobars on the charts, so the winds picking up. Bringing sunshine but plenty of showers to end the week. They will get quite lively on Thursday with some hail and thunder mixed in across the north and west and a cool breeze blowing. Parts of the south not seeing too many showers, with some sunny spells. In the capital, temperatures 19 or 20 but 13-14 typically - cool for the time year. Winds will ease by Friday with not as many showers in the afternoon but it is another day with some sunshine and quite a few downpours too. Goodbye. ~ Welcome to BBC News, broadcasting to our viewers on public television in the US and around the globe. I’m Mike Embley. Our top stories: At least 500 people have died in a heatwave in India and the extreme temperatures could go on for another two weeks. A tornado rips through the Mexican border city of Acuna. Severe weather has killed at least a dozen people. We are on the frontline with Shia militias in Iraq’s Anbar province as they try to fight back against Islamic State. They have just told us that we have got to get out encase of the fire and excitement here attracts incoming mortarfire. -- in case all of there. Around the world in 50 years - we’ll hear from the only American to have visited every single country. And three queens in formation - tens of thousands line the banks of the Mersey to mark 175 years of the Cunard shipping line. Hello. A heatwave sweeping India has killed more than 500 people. Most of the deaths are in the southern states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. With temperatures reaching 48 Celsius, 118 Fahrenheit, authorities are urging people to stay indoors and drink plenty of water. Ben Bland reports. As temperatures soar throughout India, people seek shade wherever they can. Exhausted by the extreme heat, others cool off in whatever way possible. In Kolkata in the east, drivers of the iconic yellow taxis have been urged by their unions to stay off the roads during the hottest hours. But some people were doing their best to carry on with business as usual. Despite warnings to drink plenty of water and stay indoors, so far as many as 500 people have died because of the heat. The worst affected states are Andhra Pradesh and Telangana in the south but across the country, the heatwave is expected to continue well into the coming week. Recently, we have had 48 degrees and we will keep these levels for the next few days. It is notjust the heat during the day that is dangerous but at night as well. The next few days will have the highest temperatures again across northern parts of India and severe heatwave warnings across the north-western plains. Until the monsoon rains bring cooler temperatures, there are fears the heatwave could yet claim more lives. I’ve been speaking to Alex Deakin from the BBC’s Weather Centre. It is hotter this time of year. Temperatures are widely over 40 Celsius. We are seeing temperatures pushing the high 40s. Maybe as high as 50 degrees, 122 Fahrenheit. These are as much as ten Celsius above average. Significantly above normal. And people are not getting any respite at night. That is one of the health issues. You can almost put up with high temperatures during the day if you get relief at night. At the moment, temperatures are above by day and night. There is no relief. If this goes on, it puts a lot of pressure on the body, particularly for the more vulnerable members of society. What is the latest? Is it going to go on? The prognosis is not great. Temperatures will remain above average by a number of degrees. It looks like it will go on at least a week. It depends where you are in India as to what time the monsoon arrives. It is scheduled to arrive sometime next week. It depends where you are. And even people in India are finding this unusual. Exactly. Itjust goes to show. It gets hotter at this time of year in India. It shows how unusually hot that heat is. It could continue to cause issues. A powerful tornado has swept through northern Mexico, killing at least 16 people and causing widespread destruction. Most of the confirmed deaths are in the Mexican border city of Ciudad Acuna, which was hit by winds of up to 185 miles an hour. Elaine jung has more. Street after street, the destruction laid bare, hundreds of homes torn apart. Crumpled vehicles now rest against homes and roofs. Seven blocks left devastated by the tornado. More than 1,000 homes affected, leaving many with nowhere to go. All this from a tornado sweeping through at speeds of up to 300 kilometres per hour. It only lasted six seconds. In the aftermath, bodies were found scattered across neighbourhoods. Residents clearly shellshocked and grieving the sudden loss of loved ones. Striking the northern Mexico border city of Ciudad Acuna, home to 136,000 people, the powerful tornado was a first for this town built more than a century ago. As locals pick through the pieces, the desperate search for survivors continues. Earlier this month, militants from Islamic State seized the Iraqi city of Ramadi. Its fall was seen as a major capitulation by the Iraqi Army in the strategically important Anbar province. Since then, Iraqi government forces, backed by Shia militia, have been mobilising there to try to take the fight to IS. Our world affairs editor john Simpson travelled with a group of Shia militias to the town of Garma, about halfway between Baghdad and Ramadi. Anbar province. Vast, empty, basically desert, and natural territory for IS. It has been a battleground for years. The Americans built fortifications when they were here. Now, as then, the enemy’s weapon of choice is the roadside bomb. We reach Garma as the government forces are firing at Islamic State’s last few positions in the town. IS has been forced out of the rest of it. We are with a so-called popular mobilisation unit, a militia mostly composed of Shia Muslims and commanded by Sheik Ali Dehish, a dapper character in a uniform of his own devising. The militias are the only government troops who seem able to resist Islamic State’s ferocity. But Anbar province is Sunni Muslim. Is there a danger that the sheik’s men will fight a sectarian war here? TRANSLATION: I carry the flag of Iraq, because I do notjust represent Shia or Sunni. I represent the whole of Iraq. This is what they call the frontline in the sense that it is the closest that the Iraqi forces get to the last remaining Islamic State positions. just on the other side of that ridge there. Mostly, the fire is outgoing. There aren’t that many Islamic State fighters left. But they’ve just told us we have to get out in case all the fire and excitement here attracts incoming mortar fire. And Islamic State’s by no means finished in Anbar province. Another BBC team travelling with the Iraqi Army came under fire from IS and a battle starting. It is one of the characteristics of fighting a war in Anbar that you scarcely ever get a look at your enemy. It’s a matter of life and death for the Iraqi government to drive Islamic State out of Anbar. The government believes it can be done and by the end of the year. Western diplomats are inclined to agree. But it will be an immense task. China’s state media is reporting that a fire at a rest home has killed 38 people and injured six others. The fire swept through an apartment building in Pingdingshan City in Henan province. Two of the injured are said to be in a serious condition. The cause of the fire is unknown. We can go live to Shanghai and speak to the BBC’s john Sudworth. There is some delay on our connection but as far as you can tell, what happened? Well, there is very little information at this stage. We know from state media that the cause of the fire is still being investigated. We do not know if it was accidental or was started deliberately. What we do know is thatit deliberately. What we do know is that it broke out yesterday evening and as of this morning, search and rescue operations are still ongoing. Photographs online show it to be a big blaze, a large column of black smoke rising from this site in the city of Pingdingshan. You can surmise the size of the disaster from the grim toll so far. 38 people reported dead and a good number injured, some critically. There was a case a couple of years ago when one unhappy resident did start a dapper -- deadly fire deliberately. That is right. Obviously, it is far too early to speculate in this case. There is perhaps a wider context with elderly care in China. This country has an ageing population and faces the challenge of providing safe and affordable care for ever-increasing numbers of people. That incident back in 2013 was in another province and a resident set his care home on fire, killing himself and ten other people, and it was blamed in the aftermath partly on lax safety supervision and for staffing. Those kinds of issues have been raised before but it is important to note that in this case, it is far too early to speculate. With demographic pressures, there is so much pressure to provide safe and affordable care for so many elderly people. Yes, that is exactly right. In a way, it is often described as China’s demographic timebomb. It is partly related to the one child policy. Now, even as the authorities begin to address some of those issues, the rising cost of healthcare comes as a result and an attempt to reform the one child policy and allow couples in some circumstances to have more children, it follows long decades that have already been baked into the pie, if you like. China faces this crisis of care and what people describe as an inverse pyramid. Four grandparents, two parents, one child. That makes it very difficult to find the funds to pay for that ever-growing healthcare cost. Thank you. Let’s round up some of the other main stories. The British Prime Minister, David Cameron, and the President of the European Commission, jean-Claude juncker, have met to discuss plans to renegotiate Britain’s membership of the EU. Mr Cameron is due to visit several European capitals this week to try to drum up support for his plans. The Conservative government has promised an in-out referendum by the end of 2017. Two Hong Kong government officials charged over the city’s worst maritime disaster in four decades are to go on trial. 39 people died when a passenger ferry collided with a pleasure boat off Lamma Island in October 2012. The captains of both vessels have already been tried. One was convicted of manslaughter and jailed for eight years, the other for nine months. An Air France plane has been escorted to New York’s jFK Airport by US fighterjets, following an anonymous call claiming there were chemical weapons on board. Two F16 fighters were scrambled to shadow the plane which was en route to the US from Paris. The FBI confirmed passengers had disembarked safely and no dangerous substances had been found. Stay with us on BBC News. Still to come: We’re in a small British town for a world-famous literary gathering. First, though, the stories making newspaper headlines around the world. The Asian edition of the Wall Street journal reflects on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s first year in office. He has allowed more foreign investment in railways and defence but on other key fronts, the paper suggests he has moved less decisively, frustrating investors who’d hoped for bolder change. According to China Daily, import taxes on some popular goods such as suits, furs and skin products are to be cut by around 50% to encourage Chinese people to spend more money at home rather than buy abroad. The US edition of the Financial Times reports Chinese officials are being sent to visit their shamed former colleagues in prison in the hope they will be scared into abiding by the law and refusing bribes. The UN nuclear watchdog has criticised japanese authorities for not preventing the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011. It says weaknesses were not fully assessed. That’s in the japan Times. This is BBC News. I’m Mike Embley. The latest headlines: As India looks set for two more weeks of scorching heat, the government urges people working outside to take extra precautions. More than 500 people have died in the heatwave. A tornado has ripped through the Mexican border city of Acuna. Severe weather has killed at least a dozen people. At least three people have died in flash flooding in Texas in the United States. Another 12 are reported missing after their holiday home was swept away by floodwater. Some areas saw up to ten inches of rain over a 24-hour period. Hundreds of homes have been destroyed. The state governor said it was the worst flooding Texas has seen. jason Whitely, Senior Reporter for ABC’s WFAA TV in Dallas, has the latest details. Right now behind us is the Trinity river in Dallas, Texas and the water is normally in a very narrow channel that runs through the city. As you can tell behind desk, so much water has spilt out, it is still inside the levees but it is quite a site for people around here. In other parts of the state, the governor and state officials are calling this catastrophic. It has killed five people in this state and another eight or so are missing. It is still a very serious situation and frightening also. It is something so many people here say they have never seen before. I guess with Memorial Day many people would have been coming to stay in the homes along the river. A very unlucky choice as it turned out. Absolutely. The area in central Texas full of family homes was washed away and it is a very popular area, people from all of the state go to that area but the Blinkova river rose huge amounts so people vacationing along this area for the holiday weekend which is winding up right now, they had no idea as night fell that such a severe storm was coming and people were washed away in the middle of the night. It looks like the rain will go on for a wild. How does this compare with the records -- while? It is the fourth wettest May in Texas records as it has rained 19 out of the last 25 days. We have not seen the sun a lot this month in this state. Forecasts save the rain will continue at least until the end of the month, the seven Day forecast in Dallas and many other parts of the state does not look good. We have seen pictures of cars going down the river, in some places upside down but some people managed to get out although it is claiming lives? Unfortunately it is. As we are speaking, I can see lightning off in the distance. What we don’t see a lot of in Texas and the United States is Bridges being washed away but the storm came through this holiday weekend and washed bridges away and roads as well and this is what caused many problems. People followed the old saying in Texas, turn around and don’t ground but in some cases, the water looked not so deep so people chose to try it out -- don’t drown. Writers, comedians and poets from around the world are gathering in a small British town, for one of the world’s best-loved literary events. Fans of the written word come to the Hay Festival to listen, learn and discuss all sorts of books. Rebecca jones reports. There is no mistaking where we are, a place where tens of thousands of people come to rub shoulders with some of the world’s greatest thinkers, writers and performers. Let’s go and look around. This is the 28th Hay Festival. It was dreamt up around a kitchen table in the 1980s. Look at it now. There are more than 700 events crammed into 11 days. When the former US president Bill Clinton came here, he described it as the Woodstock of the mind. Let’s listen to how the writer and comedian Stephen Fry sums up Hay. First, one of the stars of this year’s festival, actorjude Law. Eccentric, moving, inspirational, fun, relaxing, stimulating. Hay is words, Hay is wonder, Hay is freedom, Hay is talk, Hay is Hay on wine. LAUGHS. The Hay Festival is to books what Glastonbury is to music lovers. This is the festival bookshop where you can buy books and get your book signed, or perhaps meet your favourite author, so here people are waiting to meet an author whose novel has been shortlisted for this year’s Bailey’s Women’s Prize for Fiction. What else draws people here? There are writers being interviewed on stage from dawn till dusk. Loads of events for children and plenty of places to play it and to read. All part of this huge celebration of literature and ideas. No matter how much globetrotting you’ve done you’re unlikely to be as well travelled as Albert Podell. He’s the only American to have visited every single country in the world. That’s more than 190 nations. He’s written a book, called Around the World in 50 Years and he spoke to the BBC about his experiences. My philosophy in travelling is usually that the worst things happen, the better the story is going to be. I have gone to every country in the world and have written a book on it called Around the World in 50 Years, my adventure to every country on earth. My parents were very poor and we never travelled at all when I was a kid. At the age of six, I started collecting stamps and I wanted a stamp from every country in the world. But I was fascinated by these little bits of coloured paper they had of alpacas and llamas and mountains and lakes and strange looking people. And I thought it would be really cool to get out there and see all these people and that’s probably what inspired it way back. The first trip I took, the one I took in 1965 and 1966 was to drive around the world. The way we did that, we drove closer to the equator. And it took us 19 months and we set that record. So, somewhere along the way the idea kind of crept in, why not go to every country? I was up to 90,196, through the actuarial table and I thought, why not? I will see if I can go to every country in the world. Nothing great and glorious, just, why not? People mostly thought it was crazy, they thought there were better things to do in life and mostly people thought it was impossible because there were just too many problems, too many civil wars, big wars, revolutions. I think it’s fair to call it an obsession, you could call it a dedication, you could call it a mission. I had purchased a temporary ticket to go to Scotland when I thought it was going to become a country. I would actually like that. My plan would be to go there the day it became independent and then I would know that I was the only person in the world who had been to every country. The advice I would give is see a good psychiatrist, get a good life insurance agency, make out a pretty good will, read all the books and see all the movies you want because you may never get another chance. And once you get on the road, enjoy it as much as you can. Tens of thousands have lined the banks of the Mersey in Liverpool to watch three cruise liners mark 175 years since the founding of the Cunard shipping line. The three huge ships performed a series of manoeuvres on the river. Alison Freeman reports. HORN SOUNDS. They queued for hours to see history in the making. The three Queens united to celebrate Liverpool’s key role in the creation of the cruise liner industry. The largest, the Queen Mary, had been docked here for a day, awaiting her two sister ships. The crowds were admiring her size and form. I am proud to be in Liverpool, proud to be a Scouser, and this is a once-in-a-lifetime. We both love coming to to see the ships and there is no better place to come than to Liverpool on a day like today. Look at the vastness of that ship, it’sjust magnificent. It was very impressive and the little boy couldn’t get over the size of it. He was very impressed, weren’t you? Yes. So there she goes, all 198,000 tons of metal. Queen Mary is going out into the Mersey to meet her two sisters there, the Queen Elisabeth and the Queen Victoria, for the very first time. HORN SOUNDS. The shipping line Cunard started 175 years ago with a transatlantic mail service. The luxury of the three Queens today are in sharp contrast to the past. Cunard moved its headquarters to Southampton in the 60s, but the Cunard building remains, as does Liverpool’s role as the company’s spiritual home. The Cunard building sits at the centre of the Three Graces, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The three Queens are performing a salute to those three graces this lunchtime, a Riverdance of regal proportions. Now do you have a sweet tooth? Well, maybe not sweet enough for this. Here you can see the largest ever tiramisu under construction in the northern Italian town of Gemona. The coffee and cream based desert weighed in at a staggering three thousand and fifteen kilogrammes. It took over 150 people to put together, 800 litres of coffee and over half a ton of biscuits. The Peruvian capital Lima has been inundated with clowns! No its not a horror film but an annual event celebrating clown day. Hundreds of performers donning brightly coloured costumes and oversized shoes marched through the city entertaining the crowds. And you can get in touch with me and most of the team on Twitter. I’m @BBC Mike Embley. Bank Holiday Monday wasn’t spectacularly sunny but it was a dry day for many. That dry, rather cloudy theme will continue to Tuesday. Maybe drier during the day with a few more places seeing more sunshine. We will start with sunshine across eastern England. Elsewhere a lot of cloud and maybe one or two showers in parts of western Scotland. Cloud will increase generally through the course of the morning and into the afternoon before it hopefully breaks up later on. We could see some sunshine returning to parts of Wales and south-west England. Overall, though, there will be a lot of cloud. Temperatures in the mid to high teens. 18-19 possible in the sun. Cloud developing across eastern England but there will be sunny spells as there will be across the south-west of Northern Ireland. County Down in particular. Across Northern Ireland and the west of Scotland, quite a lot of cloud with brightness across eastern Scotland and showers possible in the west. Should be a dry day in Paris. Andy Murray is safely through to the second round. Sunny spells on Wednesday could see highs of 21 degrees. Back home across the UK, still a few showers in the evening on Tuesday across the north-west. They will pick up as we go towards Wednesday morning. Elsewhere it will be a dry night and with largely clear skies across the south, mist and fog possible. Temperatures widely down into single figures in towns and cities. Rural areas will be down to four or five degrees in some areas. A fresh start to Wednesday - sunny spells in the south at first. Eastern areas staying fine through the day. Still some showers in northwest Scotland and wet in Northern Ireland by the end of the morning. This rain will trickle into other western areas during the day and the winds will pick up. Feeling cool in Glasgow, nine or ten. With some brightness in the south-east, we could reach up to 20 Celsius. Wet weather in the west is from an area of low pressure which will dominate our weather from Thursday and Friday. Lots of isobars on the charts, so the winds picking up. Bringing sunshine but plenty of showers to end the week. They will get quite lively on Thursday with some hail and thunder mixed in across the north and west and a cool breeze blowing. Parts of the south not seeing too many showers, with some sunny spells. In the capital, temperatures 19 or 20 but 13-14 typically - cool for the time year. Winds will ease by Friday with not as many showers in the afternoon but it is another day with some sunshine and quite a few downpours too. Goodbye. ~ This is BBC News. The headlines: With India set for two more weeks of unusually ferocious heat, authorities have urged people to stay indoors and drink plenty of fluids. At least 500 people have died in the heatwave, most in the southern states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Temperatures have been reaching 48 Celsius. That’s 118 Fahrenheit. A powerful tornado has swept through northern Mexico, killing more than a dozen people and causing widespread destruction. Most of the confirmed deaths are in the Mexican border city of Ciudad Acuna. Around 300 people have been taken to hospital and several hundred homes have been destroyed in a matter of seconds. Severe weather has hit the south-west of the United States. In Texas, three people are known to have died and another 12 are reported missing after their holiday home was swept away by floodwater. The governor there has said that the flooding is the worst the state has ever seen. Time now for HARDtalk. Welcome to HARDtalk. I’m Stephen Sackur. West Africa has perhaps lulled outsiders into a false sense of security. The regional economy has grown fast and key countries like Nigeria, Ghana and Senegal have embraced democratic transitions. But the appearance of stability may be illusory. Boko Haram’s militant insurgency threatens notjust Nigeria but neighbouring states, and poverty, corruption and repression are still endemic in these areas. My guest today is the UN’s special representative for West Africa, Mohamed Ibn Chambas. How fragile is West Africa? Mohamed Ibn Chambas, welcome to HARDtalk. Thank you. You seem a little confused yourself, if I may say so. In recent speeches, you have talked about the real progress made in West Africa particularly on the economic front but in the same breath you have said, this region is still very fragile and faces many challenges, which suggests to me that not much progress has been made at all. No, there is progress. As you said, on the economic front there is very good progress being made. In countries like Nigeria, Ghana and Senegal. And also in some of the countries that have undergone serious conflicts such as Ivory Coast. Ivory Coast in the three or four years has been growing at a rate of... If I may interrupt you there, that really quite significant economic growth has not translated into confidence about long-term stability. You have talked about the real fragility you see in the region today. The region remains fragile. That is true from a security point of view but even politically, let us not forget that these are new democracies. If you roll back maybe 20 years ago, most of the ECOWAS states would have had military leaders or people otherwise he came to power not through democratic elections. Today, the reverse is true. Ijust came elections. Today, the reverse is true. I just came from true. Ijust came from the ECOWAS summit. That is the blog of West African nations, the economic block. -- bloc. You say that so many of them are democracies but I would put it to you that some of them are sham marquesses and others are very repressive states. But the trend is in the right direction, making sure that the leaders are chosen by the people through constitutional processes. And what is also encouraging is that the region has adopted norms that say if you do not have this requirement, you will not be recognised as legitimately elected. But the question is whether the rhetoric you have talked about, this imposition of new norms and talk of democratic transitions, whether that is supported by reality. And let’s talk about the biggest nation, the dominant nation and the one that the world knows best in this region, Nigeria. What Nigeria has faced in recent months and years is a sustained challenge from a militantjihadist from a militant jihadist insurgency, from a militantjihadist insurgency, Boko Haram. And what we have learned from that insurgency is that the Nigerian state is actually much weaker than the rhetoric would suggest. For example, its army is much, much weaker than one might have thought. Well, what we have also seen in the last two months is that where the political will is there and the determination is there, the Army can indeed perform. just before the elections, although perhaps too late, and undertaking was made to push Boko Haram out of the three north-eastern states that they were in and, indeed, that happened. On the 28th of March, elections were held in all of Nigeria including these three states. Going forward, and this is what the UN would like to see, Nigeria remains determined robust in of Boko Haram but will also work with neighbouring countries like Cameroon, Chad and Nigerto with neighbouring countries like Cameroon, Chad and Niger to put maximum pressure on Boko Haram. There must be cooperation between these countries. That is the message you have been hammering home as the UN’s Special Envoy for West Africa but it seems that the Nigerians don’t seem to be listening. Both the outgoing and incoming presidents have made it clear they do not want the internationalisation of the conflict inside their country. Internationalisation is one thing but working with neighbours is another. And they have allowed that to happen. Only begrudgingly. They have allowed Chad and Niger to work with their Armed Forces and to operate in Nigeria to engage in hot pursuit against Boko Haram, which is what they need to do. But the word I use is grudgingly. During the campaign, the newly elected president said it was disgraceful that the Nigerian military was having to lean on troops from Chad to do some of its work for it. He said that is not good enough. We can’t allow that to happen in Nigeria. Because Nigeria has tremendous capacity. But it doesn’t. If it had taken the side early enough to Boko Haram and marshalled all of the resources it has, all of its capacities, the Nigerian army... Nigerian soldiers perform incredibly well in other missions and have been doing so for generations. They were in Congo way backin generations. They were in Congo way back in 1960 and have been one of the major contributors to UN peacekeeping missions. And they have demonstrated good capacity. But maybe... We hope that from now we will see this new disposition... Well. .. Well... Of Nigerian troops fighting Boko Haram. And cooperating. You say hopefully, so let us tease this out a bit. You have been with negotiations between the government of Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon and Niger. You want to see a more integrated command structure for these regional forces fighting Boko Haram. You want to see common rules of engagement. And you want to see a constitutional right of cross-border hot pursuit. Has that all been established? Yes, through the multinationaljoint task force. established? Yes, through the multinational joint task force. The nations and the UN have worked together to define this concept of operation. And it is accepted now by the four countries to work within a framework of chapter eight of the UN Charter. It is true that there was some disagreement regarding chapter seven or... Because Chad, for example, relatively effective militarily, example, relatively effective militarily, did cross the border to take on Boko Haram inside Nigeria in one incident quite recently, they made it clear that they want to see chapter seven powers. The international community says this should be a chapter seven operation which means there is a right of military intervention across borders. But the Nigerians have never accepted that. The Nigerians have argued they would like to co-operate with their neighbours and they believe it may not be necessary to move to a chapter seven says. They have not achieved that. It is for the countries themselves to discuss and agree on a common approach. What is important is for them to agree that they can, working among themselves and with others and with technical and material support from partners... Have you spoken with the new president of Nigeria? Absolutely. Have you told him in your view and the UN’s view, this should be a fully integrated military operation under UN Charter seven? He understands very well and in fact looks forward to increased cooperation with his neighbours in order to take the fight to Boko Haram. Did he accept this point about chapter seven? No. Haram. Did he accept this point about chapterseven? No. It about chapter seven? No. It is not at this point a discussion that he is leading. He has said, untill take over, I will leave it to the current government falls top when I’m in charge, I will consult with mY I’m in charge, I will consult with my neighbours, with Cameroon, Chad and Niger, and we will determine what is the best option to work together to confront Boko Haram and I think that is a prudent approach. To consult deeply. Of the new government needs to consult deeply with their neighbours. And at this stage in the fight, let’s face it, Boko Haram has been pushed to the corner. They are only in the Zambezi Forest. You say they are only in the Zambezi Forest but the fact is they are still losing out suicide attacks every day in the country. We know the Chibok girls and thousands others are still disappeared. It is very hard to accept you saying that we know Boko Haram is on the run because that is not very clear at all. But that is the fact on the ground. All of the towns they used to occupy have been liberated. That is not to say that Boko Haram has been crushed. Farfrom is not to say that Boko Haram has been crushed. Far from that. Obviously, they still had capacity to operate in small cells with suicide bombers in small pockets. But the Boko Haram that we saw almost as a standing army taking and holding territory seems to be a thing of the past now and I would hope that Nigeria would rise up and keep the pressure on Boko Haram in the way we have seen in the last few months. An interesting phrase, keeping the pressure on Boko Haram. It strikes me that you are in danger with your UN hat on, of giving legitimacy to practices of the Nigerian military which the human rights community including Amnesty International and the US government has condemned over months and years. Amnesty International has talked about this human rights violations including arbitrary arrest, torture and suspected war crime including extrajudicial executions notjust by Boko Haram out by the Nigerian military as well, the military that you say you want to operate under some sort of badge of UN legitimacy. On the contrary. The UN has been very upfront. The Secretary General has spoken about it. The security council has spoken about it. We have spoken about the need to be cautious of engaging in military operations in a manner that does not turn the population against legitimate security forces. .. population against legitimate security forces... With respect, in the nine months that you have been the representative in the region, you have not called out the Nigerian military consistently. US not said that you don’t believe... I don’t know if you have seen the video evidence but are you telling me that you do not believe there is significant evidence of the Nigerian military committing war crimes? What I’m saying is that I have engaged at the highest level in Nigeria including top leadership of the military and constructively to say that we need to be conscious about human rights issues even as we pursue bad guys such as Boko Haram. Let’s talk about issues that go beyond Nigeria’s borders. Lord Boyce is important. You represent the Secretary General across this West African region. -- your voice is important. Why have you not used your voice more powerfully to contend those governments and those leaders in West Africa who continue to abuse human rights and repress freedom is, basic freedoms across the nation states of the region? -- to condemn. Why not? We work on human rights issues upfront. Often, failure to respect human rights from the beginning of conflicts in the region. It is not only the UN, we work very closely with ECOWAS and the AU. .. work very closely with ECOWAS and the AU... But do these organisations really make a difference quest for example, ECOWAS, the economic group, they tried to convince all of the regional governments to sign onto this idea that from now on there would be only 2-term presidential terms across the region. Two governments have blocked that move. They are Gambierand governments have blocked that move. They are Gambier and Togo. -- Gambia. Are you telling me that those two governments are fundamentally challenging the progressive move towards political freedom in the region? No. First of all, those two governments did not block the move. The discussion was presented to the heads of state and the heads of state have asked for further studies and discussion on this issue because of the different systems of constitutional government. This is a hot button issue for African people. They want to know that their rulers will not rule them forever. They want to know that term leaders are meaningful in Africa today. And you have, for example, the President of Gambia saying, I will rule this country for 1 billion years if necessary if Allah says so. Why don’t you call that out and condemn that? He will not livel million years. Of that out and condemn that? He will not live I million years. Of course he won’t but he might live for a very long time. These are the kinds of issues that are at stake. He is operating more or less on a parliamentary system and so... You seriously think that Gambia today is a parliamentary democracy? Well, not an ideal type but certainly... One Gambian critic has called it, basically, a prison camp in West Africa kept afloat by tourist dollars. It has challenges. It is a young democracy with all of the challenges we know about. ~ Iam I am saying we should engage in Gambia and make efforts to make them conform to the rest of the region that practices in a certain way. We’re not going to have Gambia overnight saying, OK we will do that but on the other hand, it should not discourage us from engaging... You represent the United front of the world, the UN, when you look at West Africa today but your own background is as a minister and senior diplomat representing one of the governments of West Africa, Donna and I wonder because you are a diplomat, you are inclined to be too nice and too soft with the member states of your region? No, we delivertop with the member states of your region? No, we deliver top messages when we have to do so. Do you really? Let’s see how far you will be. The migration issue is such a huge issue particularly in Africa today where we see thousands and thousands of Africans, mostly young, desperate to leave their home countries because of poverty and repression and find a new life. Some go south to South Africa and many go north trying to reach the Mediterranean and then on to Europe but the leaders in West Africa, far from addressing the problems in their own countries which seem to drive this migration, seemed to be accessed with condemning both Europe and South Africa for their treatment of migrants at a later stage. Surely thatis of migrants at a later stage. Surely that is missing the point? If we have to be consistent on issues of human rights, been the way people are treated, in a manner that is less than human needs condemnation. So whether they are migrants or not, they need to be treated with respect and dignity which is not to run away from the fundamental issues underlying the causes of migration, which, as we know... That is the point of stock you put your emphasis on what is happening in West Africa that makes so many people so desperate. In the words of a journalist and commentator who works for the UN, journalist and commentator who works forthe UN, she says journalist and commentator who works for the UN, she says why do our African leaders make no speeches explaining why our young people are so desperate to leave their own countries? The push factors are known. That is what you should be focusing on, the miss rule, the corruption, the failures, systemic and an Damik of so many countries in the region to give a decent life to their people. Those issues, in a fundamental way, that you mentioned at the beginning of the programme... Significant development are happening in the countries such as Nigeria which are probably the original point of many of the migrants. Economic growth is not translating into better lives for most ordinary people. That is just to say that we cannot say the governments are not doing anything about these problems. It is a secular problem. There are also pull factors in Europe, which is a fact. The demand is there for this labour and that is why these young people are going and when they go, they’re going intojobs that are going and when they go, they’re going into jobs that they are able to land in Europe due to an ageing population and so forth. This is what an EU spokesperson said in regards to setting up societies and countries like Niger to stop the flow, she said it will be a question of linking development aid with cooperation from those African countries on taking their own nationals back. Do you think that is the right policy for Europe? I mean, it will require more than that also. Do you want to see European aid and assistance to, for example, a country like Niger in the future specifically tied to their willingness to set up migrants centres and to be very active in transporting would-be migrants back to their homes? If it is done in a very transparent way, yes but the problem you have sometimes is that people going to Niger don’t necessarily come from there. Sometimes people get dumped there. We also have to look at some of the long-standing relationships, economic institutional relationship between Africa and Europe which have hindered the kind of growth that generates employment. If Africa is going to continue to export raw materials without processing, without creating some form of value, added industrialisation that will create jobs, value, added industrialisation that will createjobs, the will create jobs, the young graduates and trained people when they finish will not have jobs in a modern, mobile world and they will move. South Africa hosts up to 5 million migrants right now and jacob Zuma after the surge of xenophobic violence said that our brother countries in Africa contribute to this. Why are their citizens not staying in their own countries? It is not useful to criticize South Africa as though we encourage these foreign nationals to come and endure ill-treatment. As the immigrants say in South Africa, we cannot go back home because if we do, we will disappear. That is the real problem. We should not exaggerate it. Which migrants will disappear if they go back to Nigeria? They don’t want to go back, do they? It is not because they will disappear. We have to put things in the right context. Many of them are economic, not political refugees. I can accept if someone is from every tree, -- Eritrea, a country that obviously doesn’t respect the rights of its people, then yes but not Mozambique next door. We have talked about security issues and now we’re talking about economic and migration issues coming out of West Africa. This idea that West Africa is progressing nicely is becoming a source of stability -- and becoming, it is very complacent. It is relative. West Africa is in transition. If you went back 20 years ago, the level of instability and civil wars and deaths that were occurring, compared to today, in spite of global economic challenges, the region is now the second fastest-growing. We are seeing more a constitutional and democratic approach to governance. It is on the right track and that is why, for the United Nations, we have an interest to work with regional organizations to strengthen internal capacities to consolidate this positive trend. We want to reach this vision of a stable, prosperous West Africa where young people will be able to stay home and achieve all their potential. That challenges still there. A long way to go. But we are on the right track and that is what we need to support, all of us together. Mohamed Ibn Chambas, we have to end there. Thank you for being on HARDtalk.

It’s a big week for Britain’s newly re-elected Prime Minister David Cameron as he launches his attempt to renegotiate the UK’s relationship with the European Union. He’ll visit several European capitals, seeking support for changes to the EU’s rules ahead of a referendum on whether the UK should remain a member. Last night he held talks near London with the EU Commission President jean-Claude juncker, and told him the British people were not happy with the status quo. Ross Hawkins has more. For three is, talked, Forthree is, talked, discussing immigration and sovereignty. But this dinner was as much part of the charm offensive as a detailed negotiation.

David Cameron and his officials will do the real work behind closed doors. If he is to get a deal in the EU and the referendum in Britain, it will take much more than shared meals. A fire at a rest home in eastern China has killed 38 people and injured six others. The blaze swept through an apartment building in Pingdingshan city in Henan province. Two of the injured are said to be in a serious condition. We can go live to Shanghai and speak to the BBC’s john Sudworth. Any more details? We know that the blaze started Monday night. State media is reporting there were around 130 residents in this home, that the fire started in an area for disabled and paralysed elderly residents. We know nothing beyond that about the cause. State media saying that is still being investigated. There have been one of two similar cases over recent years where they have been fires in elderly residential homes. State media has suggested lax safety systems or standards may have been partly to blame. That detail, that the fire was centred on this area where some of the relatives may have been unable to assist themselves will raise similar questions. Any changes as a result of those earlier fires? There have been in recent years some improvements in some of the regulations concerning safety. Often it is suggested in China that while the rules might be pretty good, enforcement is lax. That is partly because of the crisis in funding in healthcare in general in China. Particularly with elderly care. This country faces this huge demographic timebomb, this ageing population. The challenge of providing safe and affordable care is one that the Chinese authorities know is a cute -- and a cute one. There was a situation where one elderly residents started a fire that killed him and ten other residents. Thank you very much. The heatwave that’s killed more than 500 people in India is expected to continue for several days. Most of the deaths are in the southern states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. With temperatures reaching 48 Celsius -118 Fahrenheit- the authorities are urging people to stay indoors and drink plenty of water. Ben Bland reports. As temperatures soar throughout India, people seek shade wherever they can. Exhausted by the extreme heat, others cool off in whatever way possible. In Kolkata in the east, drivers of the iconic yellow taxis have been urged by their unions to stay off the roads during the hottest hours. But some people were doing their best to carry on with business as usual. Despite warnings to drink plenty of water and stay indoors, so far as many as 500 people have died because of the heat. The worst affected states are Andhra Pradesh and Telangana in the south but across the country, the heatwave is expected to continue well into the coming week. Recently, we have had 48 degrees and we will keep these levels for the next few days. It is notjust the heat during the day that is dangerous but at night as well. The next few days will have the highest temperatures again across northern parts of India and severe heatwave warnings across the north-western plains. Until the monsoon rains bring cooler temperatures, there are fears the heatwave could yet claim more lives. Greece, Bulgaria and Turkey have agreed to establish a joint centre for border police and customs control, to tackle illegal immigration, organised crime and terrorism. Thousands of refugees, many of them from Syria, attempt to enter the European Union via Turkey. The Washington Post’s Tehran correspondent jason Rezaian goes on trial today on espionage charges after ten months in an Iranian prison. The newspaper and the White House have called the charges absurd and demanded his release. US officials have raised his case during months of nuclear negotiations with Iran, but have declined to link the two. An Air France plane has been escorted to New York’s jFK Airport by US fighterjets, following an anonymous call claiming there were chemical weapons on board. Two F-15 fighters were scrambled to shadow the plane which was en route to the US from Paris. The FBI confirmed that passengers had disembarked safely and no dangerous substances had been found Earlier this month militants from Islamic State seized the Iraqi city of Ramadi. Its fall was seen as a major capitulation by the Iraqi army in the strategically important Anbar Province. Since then, Iraqi government forces, backed by Shia militia, have been mobilising there, to try to take the fight to IS. Our World Affairs Editorjohn Simpson travelled with a group of Shia militias to the town of Garma, about halfway between Baghdad and Ramadi Anbar province. Vast, empty, basically desert, and natural territory for IS. It has been a battleground for years. The Americans built fortifications when they were here. Now, as then, the enemy’s weapon of choice is the roadside bomb. We reach Garma as the government forces are firing at Islamic State’s last few positions in the town. IS has been forced out of the rest of it. We are with a so-called popular mobilisation unit, a militia mostly composed of Shia Muslims and commanded by Sheik Ali Dehish, a dapper character in a uniform of his own devising. The militias are the only government troops who seem able to resist Islamic State’s ferocity. But Anbar province is Sunni Muslim. Is there a danger that the sheik’s men will fight a sectarian war here? TRANSLATION: I carry the flag of Iraq, because I do notjust represent Shia or Sunni. I represent the whole of Iraq. This is what they call the frontline in the sense that it is the closest that the Iraqi forces get to the last remaining Islamic State positions just on the other side of that ridge there. Mostly, the fire is outgoing. There aren’t that many Islamic State fighters left. But they’ve just told us we have to get out in case all the fire and excitement here attracts incoming mortar fire. And Islamic State’s by no means finished in Anbar province. Another BBC team travelling with the Iraqi Army came under fire from IS and a battle starting. It is one of the characteristics of fighting a war in Anbar that you scarcely ever get a look at your enemy. It’s a matter of life and death for the Iraqi government to drive Islamic State out of Anbar. The government believes it can be done and by the end of the year. Western diplomats here are inclined to agree. But it will be an immense task. Time for all the business news. We begin with a gold rush in the Arctic with our very own golden boy. It is black gold what we are talking about. Starting with this. It looks as though Big Oil is winning the Battle of the Arctic. The US administration has recently given the go-ahead for Shell to explore off the coast of Alaska. And the rewards can be enormous for the companies. It’s estimated there are something like 90 billion barrels of oil below the arctic. 1,670 trillion cubic feet of natural gas - that’s hard to get that into your head, but I’ll tell you what it is - it’s 30% of the world’s natural gas resources and 13% of the world’s undiscovered oil. But here’s the cost. Oil spills are a tremendous risk to arctic ecosystems, with polar bears and whales the first to go if pollution becomes too intense. International oil company executives meet today to discuss new technologies and methods the industry has adopted to avoid pollution. But do these advances mean companies like Shell can now be trusted to drill in the Arctic? We have got a special report on that one coming up. Also, here is a cracker. Agriculture uses an estimated 70% of the world’s fresh water supply. California, which has the largest agriculture industry in America is in its fourth year of drought. But in New York, a new crop of urban farms are employing green methods that use much less water than traditional soil growing. They use fish. We have got this special report. Is it the future of farming. That is coming up injust over 15 minutes. Follow me on Twitter. That is it for the business. Stay with us on BBC News, still to come. We’ll meet the man who’s been to every single country in the world and hear his advice if you’re thinking of doing the same. Now a look at some of the UK news. Detectives looking for a man suspected of killing his young sister, mother and her partner have discovered his body in Oxford. Police had been searching for jed Allen, who was 21, since his family members were found dead at their home in Didcot on Saturday. Police say they’d suffered fatal stab wounds. A crucial vote over welfare reform is due to be held at Stormont later today. Disagreements over the issue are threatening the future of power-sharing in Northern Ireland. Sinn Fein has moved a petition of concern to stop the passage of the Welfare Bill. Scotland’s First Minister will use a speech in Edinburgh today to attack the ""scale and speed"" of spending cuts planned by the UK government. In her first major economic speech since the election, Nicola Sturgeon will argue that David Cameron must either change his approach, or find ways to lessen the impact on Scotland. The SNP, which campaigned during the election for an alternative to austerity, won 56 of Scotland’s 59 seats at Westminster. This is BBC World News.

A powerful tornado has swept through northern Mexico, killing at least 16 people and causing widespread destruction. Most of the confirmed deaths are in the border city of Ciudad Acuna which was hit by winds of up to 300 kilometres an hour. Elaine jung has more. Street after street, the destruction laid bare, hundreds of homes torn apart and crumpled vehicles now rest against homes and roofs. Seven blocks left devastated by the tornado. More than 1,000 homes affected, leaving many with nowhere to go. All this from a tornado sweeping through at speeds of up to 300 kilometres per hour. It only lasted six seconds. In the aftermath, bodies were found scattered across neighbourhoods. Residents clearly shellshocked and grieving the sudden loss of loved ones. Striking the northern Mexico border city of Ciudad Acuna, home to 136,000 people, the powerful tornado was a first for this town built more than a century ago. As locals pick through the pieces, the desperate search for survivors continues. A protester has died in clashes with police Tunnelling on Crossrail comes to an end next month. But what happens to the millions of tons of earth that’s been excavated? Well much of it has been shipped to what will be one of the largest nature reserves in Europe, on Wallasea Island off the east coast of England. The BBC’s Andrew Bomford has been finding out more. Deep under London, enormous tunnels are being constructed. This one is 40 feet high and will become a station platform. Eight giant tunnel boring machines have chewed through miles of birth. Building their own walls behind them. -- earth. At a station after station, the machines have broken through. -- at station after station. The final breakthrough comes next week at Farringdon. But this stuff, mud, birth, clay, is normally called spoil, it is a byproduct and a nuisance, something to be got rid of. Not here, though. Here it is the building block for a unique partnership between construction and wildlife. It is extraordinary. I have been on tunnelling and construction projects for 25 years and this is the first time that I have seen a commitment of this magnitude, of creating an entire marshland that’s devoted not the our immediate needs or passengers or travellers or if you are making a highway tunnel or a bridge to those users, but the birds. About half of the soil, 3 million tons, has travelled by barge up river to an RSPB nature reserve called Wallasea Island near Southend. Here it is loaded and spread across an area twice the size of the city of London, creating seawalls, lagoons, islands and vast areas of marshland. It should be a valuable haven for plants, birds and wildlife and providing flood protection to a coastline being threatened by rising sea levels. The land has been raised by up to two metres in places, but within a few weeks, all of this heavy machinery will leave and the seawalls deliberately broken to allow the sea in. And then nature takes its course, bringing fertile layers of silt and a habitat for about 50,000 migrating birds. From deep under London to the Essex coast here, this earth is currently holding back the sea. But in about six weeks time the seawalls he will be breached, the sea will rush in and this whole area here will turn into a saltmarsh. On a big spring tide all you will see is water, all of this saltmarsh will go under. Part of the island were created using similar methods a few years ago. Already a man-made saltmarsh look entirely natural. What we are creating here is Europe’s largest of its type. One of the largest in terms of its area and in terms of land raising so it will combine a range of habitats notjust for birds but for a range of invertebrates, plants, the whole gambit, really. At a time when parts of the once wild coastline are being lost, this, the biggest coastal conservation scheme ever attempted in Britain, will turn the clock back to an environment last seen here for a hundred years ago, but more importantly, it protects and conserves the coastline well into the future. On to sport now, and England captain Alistair Cook said it was one of the best matches he’d ever been involved in after his side beat New Zealand in the first cricket test at Lord’s. The Kiwis were set a target of 345 for victory on Monday after Ben Stokes had hit the fastest England century at Lords on Day four. Stokes then took three wickets to help bowl out the Black Caps. England won by 124 runs. just a brilliant day. A brilliant test match from both sides, really. Played in a brilliant spirit and highly competitive but in the right way. We were lucky to come out with the right results and full credit to them for the way they played. In football, Real Madrid President Florentino Perez has sacked manager Carlo Ancelotti as he looks to give the Spanish giants ""fresh impetus."" Ancelotti became the fall guy for a season without any major silverware. The Italian had one year left on his contract. He led Real to a record-extending tenth European crown and a Spanish Cup triumph in 2014. But this season, they were eliminated in the Champions League semi-finals by juventus. And their great rivals Barcelona won the League. Real also lost to Atletico Madrid, in the last sixteen of the King’s Cup. TRANSLATION: Carlo Ancelotti has earned my affection and the affection of the board of directors and supporters. He is part of our history because we won the 10th European title with him as coach. As everyone knows that Real Madrid we demand the best and we think it is time to give a new boost. We have a great squad and we know that with their talent we will bring newjoy to what is the most important thing we work for, members and fans. It’s welcome back to the English Premier League for Norwich City. The Canaries won what’s known as the most lucrative match in football- the Championship Playoff against Middlesbrough at Wembley. Norwich manager, Alex Neil said it was all about his team having self-belief. They were relegated last season and returned with a 2-0 win. Many of the players who went down with the team to the Championship helped the side to go straight back up and earn the club millions of dollars thanks to their share in the television deals the Premier League have. No matter how much globetrotting you’ve done you’re unlikely to be as well travelled as Albert Podell. He’s the only American to have visited every single country in the world. That’s more than 190 nations. He’s written a book, called Around the World in 50 Years - and he spoke to the BBC about his experiences. My philosophy in travelling is usually that the worst things happen, the better the story is going to be. I have gone to every country in the world and have written a book on it called Around the World in 50 Years, My Adventure to Every Country on Earth. My parents were very poor and we never travelled at all when I was a kid. At the age of six, I started collecting stamps and I wanted a stamp from every country in the world. I was fascinated by these little bits of coloured paper they had of alpacas and llamas and mountains and lakes and strange looking people. And I thought it would be really cool to get out there and see all these people and that’s probably what inspired it way back. The first trip I took, the one I took in 1965 and 1966 was to drive around the world. The way we did that, we drove closer to the equator. And it took us 19 months and we set that record. So, somewhere along the way the idea kind of crept in, why not go to every country? I was up to 90, 196, so I looked through the actuarial table and I thought, why not? I will see if I can go to every country in the world. Nothing grand and glorious, just, why not? People mostly thought it was crazy, they thought there were better things to do in life and mostly people thought it was impossible because there were just too many problems, too many civil wars, big wars, revolutions. I think it’s fair to call it an obsession, you could call it a dedication, you could call it a mission. I had purchased a temporary ticket to go to Scotland when I thought it was going to become a country. I would actually like that. My plan would be to go there the day it became independent and then I would know that I was the only person in the world who had been to every country. The advice I would give is see a good psychiatrist, see a good life insurance agency, make out a pretty good will, read all the books and see all the movies you want, because you may never get another chance. And once you get on the road, enjoy it as much as you can. David Cameron has had talks with the EU commission president on reforming the EU and renegotiating the UK pars relationship with it and David Cameron says the British people were not happy with the status quo.

Now for the latest financial news World Business Report. Unspoilt natural wonder or an untapped source of enormous riches. As Shell gets the go-ahead to explore the arctic for oil and gas, we look at the big rewards and the huge risks. And you fancy a bit of fish with your salad, believe it or not these fish are actually growing lettuce. It’s day number two of our future of farming special. Welcome to World Business Report. I’m Aaron Heslehurst. In a minute we’ll talk to Rico about Tata Motors’ results. It looks as though Big Oil is winning the Battle of the Arctic. The US administration has recently given the go-ahead for Shell to explore off the coast of Alaska. And the rewards can be enormous for the companies...It’s estimated there are something like 90 billion barrels of oil below the arctic.1,670 trillion cubic feet of natural gas - that’s hard to get that into your head, but I’ll tell you what it is - it’s 30% of the world’s natural gas resources and 13% of the world’s undiscovered oil. But here’s the cost. Oil spills are a tremendous risk to arctic ecosystems, with polar bears and whales the first to go if pollution becomes too intense. International oil company executives meet today to discuss new technologies and methods the industry has adopted to avoid pollution. But do these advances mean companies like Shell can now be trusted to drill in the Arctic? jeremy Howell reports. The port of Seattle last week. Protesters, activists, that swarm around a Shell drilling rig. The Administration has given the go-ahead for Shell to explore Alaska and licences permitting summer. For America’s government, the outreach was trumped by its need for energy security. We want self-sufficiency for the United States by producing imports that would come from outside. They are moving towards self-sufficiency. Shell says it will be taking unprecedented safety measures in the Arctic. The industry has learned lessons from recent disasters, such as the fire and oil spill five years ago at the BP drill site in the Gulf of Mexico. But there was another big oil spill off the coast of California. Can there be any guaranteed mistakes will not be made in the Arctic? There are some real challenges, a chance of storms, and what of floating ice that can provide real challenges. We have not really explored that environment to a great extent. Lessons from operating in other, more benign areas, do not necessarily apply directly to the Arctic. Shell’s Arctic oilfield could supply America with up to 1 million barrels of crude for the years to come. The government is taking a calculator the risk that Shell can do this without upsetting the Arctic’s pristine environment. Indian car giant Tata Motors has seen its share price retreat ahead of full year earnings results due out later today. Let’s crossover now to Rico Hizon in the BBC’s Singapore newsroom to tell us more. The shares have fallen a bit. What does this suggest? Very worried. Investors are thinking about two things. A slowdown in luxury sales in China and weaker domestic output of its compact cars, the cheapest car in the world. Its Land Rover business makes up 20% of its bottomline. An analyst ice broke with the earlier is not very optimistic about the numbers. -- I spoke with. It has come down. China’s Land Rover volumes contribute 25% of the total global volume. If it goes down in China, it will impact overall profitability. The reasons have been very clear. We have seen complaints from the government and the prices have been reduced substantially. The car prices have to be reduced substantially to maintain the market share. Tata hopes to bounce back by introducing new models for the jaguar Land Rover and the Nano. When I visit London later this year, I will be seeing you driving that jack Weil and over. will be seeing you driving that jack Weiland over. UKIP Weil and over. UKIP across those numbers and I will say Tata for now. She later. Agriculture uses an estimated 70% of the earth’s freshwater supply. But water use is of increasing concern in the United States. California, which has the largest agriculture industry of any state in America, is in its fourth year of drought. But in New York, a new crop of urban farmers are employing growing methods that use much less water than traditional soil growing. So is this the future of farming? In the latest in our series, Michelle Fleury’s in NY city of all places to find out. It is under the surface that the magic happens. It lets you produce fish and plants at the same time. The waste from these fish is broken down, punched to the growing bed where it becomes food for these plants. It is all water. It is all we have, water. This is no backyard hobby. 600 square feet of floating beds grow a mix of letters to sell to local restaurants the same day they are harvested. They plan to sell their fish as well. All that is conserving water. It is growing fish and vegetables in the same space. I also use about 80% less water than I would use if I were growing traditionally. This was once an empty lot in Brooklyn. Now it is home to New York’s first tackle chronic farm. It is not the only non- traditional farm growing begin the Big Apple. It is easy to miss, but on top of the supermarket a commercial scale rooftop greenhouse. The people behind this thought there was a better way to get fresh produce into the hands of shoppers. Rather than having to go thousands of miles. This man is not a farmer. But he and his partners found a way to make it pay. Sustainability is a big part of what we are doing. Ecological and sustainable. There is a real business behind what we are doing. A big selling point of farms like these is the use less water to grow more. The demand for water in agriculture will be what reshapes our food systems. We agriculture will be what reshapes ourfood systems. We need our food systems. We need to start looking at alternatives. And the locality as part of it. This is how short the distance as from the greenhouse to the food downstairs. Bringing new meaning to the same, from farm to fork. Greece intends to keep repaying its debt, a government spokesman said, only days after Interior Minister Nikos Voutsis warned it had run out of funds. Gabriel Sakellaridis said Greece would maintain repayments to its EU-IMF creditors for as long as possible. He also rejected the idea of possible capital controls that would restrict money transfers and access to savings. The Vatican bank, officially known as the Institute for Religious Works, has seen a sharp jump in its profits for 2014.The bank earned $76 million last year, compared tojust over $3 million The prices have changed to reflect the drop in oil prices. We will keep an eye on those numbers. You can get me on BBC. I will be back to take a look at the newspapers around the world. Detectives looking for a man suspected of a triple murder have called off their manhunt after discovering his body. Police have been searching forjed Allen since his sister, mother and been searching forjed Allen since his sister, motherand her his sister, mother and her partner were found dead at their home in Didcot. The primary school is closed for half-time today, but flowers and messages have been left by the classmates. Her body, along with her mother and partner were found at their home in Didcot on Saturday evening. They had all been stabbed. The police were only ever looking for one suspect, 21-year-old jed Allen. They believe he killed his half sister, mother and Allen. They believe he killed his half sister, motherand her half sister, mother and her partner. A huge police search ended yesterday evening when a body was found 50 miles away. We are satisfied this is the body ofjed Allen named as a suspect in this investigation. Members of all the victims families have been informed. While the investigation will continue, I am not seeking anybody else. These are the last images ofjed Allen taken from CCTV in an Oxford railway station on Saturday, just hours before the discovery. Staff will try to piece together exactly what happened and ifjed Allen did kill his own family, why did he do it.

Excavations from the Crossrail project- Europe’s biggest engineering scheme - is helping to build a wildlife haven that’s twice the size of London. Now it is time for our newspaper review. What’s making headlines around the world? The European Wall Street journal reports on the struggles within Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras’ ruling Syriza party. While financial pressures are mounting on Greece, dissent is spreading amongst its leaders. According to the UK Financial Times, new policy could soon be introduced in Britain to punish more traders for equity manipulation, and to give harsher penalties to those found breaking the rules. Do you want to do any more shall I go? ! -- orshalll Do you want to do any more shall I go? ! -- orshall I go? ! Since Pope Francis took the reigns at the Vatican, profits have gone through the roof. The Vatican bank earned almost 70 million euros in 2014, compared to less than 3 million the year before. It’s all because the pope asked for more transparency and accountability. That’s in the Telegraph Business lift out. ~ Iam lama I am a gentleman, I will let you do the next one as well. LAUGHS. Uber users rejoice. Users of the taxi app which allows people to order and pay for a ride from their mobile phone, could soon have better airport access. At the moment, many airports don’t let Uber-X drivers use the official taxi stands, but more are slowly relaxing the rules. There are a couple of obesity stories, in fact, three of them in the popular papers today. The Times looks at a report by a top children’s doctor, which claims the NHS are wasting millions on a doomed anti-obesity strategy because it targets the wrong people entirely. Wow! And according to the Daily Telegraph, living near a main road or under a flight path can cause people to gain weight. It’s not because they’re avoiding spending time outdoors though. It’s to do with stress. We will look into that. The body hanging on to the fat. joining us isjessica Ground, UK Equities Fund Manager at Schroders. Welcome back, jessica. Let’s start with Greece. It feels like deja vu. Now they are going to pay their debts, they don’t know if they can get it through parliament and it doesn’t seem to be getting easier as we go from, they scraped by on the last payment and they have another coming up and they are only increasing. It is hard to see how they will get the structural reform necessary. Yesterday, no, the Interior Minister came out and said, we can’t pay you, the $1.25 billion on the fifth ofjune to IMF. The spokesman now saying that they are paying. Does Syriza know what is going on with its members or its cabinet? Is it part of the strategy for Greece negotiating? It would be great to think there is a grand strategy but it feels like they lurch from one day to the next. It sounds like those negotiating are getting more comfortable with where things are going. They haven’t necessarily sold it to their allies in parliament at home, with a small majority of 12. It is a coalition, that’s part of the dynamic. You are going from fighting a war on one front with your negotiators and you are having to sell it at home with pension cuts means it will be difficult for a left-wing party. Briefly, they have to sell it at home. These election pledges, they don’t only have to sell it to the public, but to the party, the left-wing of the party. Exactly, and it will be incredibly difficult. It is big structural reform. This is what people who have led Greece have always said, they want budget surplus and reform and these things are not easy to get through with politicians and the electorate. Living on the Financial Times. The headline is, regulators in line for greater powers to squelch City scandals. They are talking about more powers but it is about dealing with these scandals -- quell. There are strict rules for me about conflict of interest, how to treat the client’ interest and my own. Insider trading, the client’ interest and my own. Insidertrading, I can the client’ interest and my own. Insider trading, I can get fined and Ican Insider trading, I can get fined and I can also go to prison. There are interest rates markets like LIBOR where the sections have not been as strong. As recent scandals have emerged, yes, there have been massive fines but individuals have walked away free, many times keeping their bonuses because it has been hard to prove wrongdoing. They are taking standards operating in equities and applying them to all of these other markets and I think it is very sensible. Real change? Real change should have been there before. People should have confidence in all markets. Interesting. You say you could go to jail. Let’s be frank, we haven’t seen it since the crisis and great reading, one after the other, we haven’t seen anyone really go to jail -- rate haven’t seen anyone really go to jail-- rate rigging. Because we haven’t had sanctions in the market like this. If they had been happening in the equity market, you would have seen people in prison. These pets have been the wild west of financial products. -- bets. The behaviour is appalling and it is shocking no one has gone to prison. One area with change, a bank with change, the Vatican Bank. Profits are up thanks to what? This Pope has been dramatic in shaking up the establishment. He has said to the Vatican Bank, you have got to get into line. They were not complying with money laundering laws. They have cut 4500 accounts and profits have gone up. Shrinking to grow. The Vatican Bank hasn’t been scandal free, it has had years of one after the other. It has seemed pretty murky and it sounds like they are regulating their activities. Nice idea, a Pope all about the simple life and helping the poor, he has brought profits back. I am sure he will be using these... He is someone who puts his money where his mouth is. The reason profits are up is because so much money was spent on the attempt to root out the problems. Exactly. OK, let’s talk about the International New York Times and Uber. Have you used Uber? Yeah. This is about airports. In general, if you go to an airport with Uber, they cannot drop you off in the taxi ranks. Especially like jFK and the bigger ones. This is talking about San Francisco airport. Atlanta, yeah. The authorities have to catch up because Uber is growing and growing. It is one of the fastest-growing tech companies there is and people are increasingly wanting to use it. We had friends from America and they were using Uber to go from America and they were using Uberto go around Uber to go around London. For the international traveller, we expect to have that access. Taxi companies and airports are the holy Grail. They won’t like it. I don’t know how many times you have spoken to a taxi driver but they have to pay to get onto the premises sometimes. I imagine and suspect airports will open up if there is something in it for them as well, interesting. We will see. We have some obesity stories. Let’s start with the front of the Times, which is the broadest story, obesity strategy of the government is failing because... Well, the problems are not being nipped in the bud. Exactly, they are saving you have to catch it early, it doesn’t mean children only, it means pregnant women and making sure it doesn’t happen in vitro. And then afterwards with breast-feeding. I think it is all very sensible. I wouldn’t want to see you walk away from doing children or adults when the scale of the problem that comes out in this article, one in 511 -year-olds being overweight -- one in five 11 -year-olds being overweight. There seems to be a looming problem. We have about 30 seconds left, very briefly, the other part of obesity is if you live near a noisy road or under a flight path, the body gets scared and hangs onto the fat. Is it... ? It is a Hang on from earlier in the abolition restage that a store fat because they don’t know where their next meal is coming from -- hang. Expensive airports. Expansive Expensive airports.

Plus, after a disappointing bank holiday Monday, Sara is here with a full weather forecast. Good afternoon and welcome to BBC News at One. A court’s been told how a financial trader who’s accused of rigging lending rates between banks was motivated by pure greed. Tom Hayes, who’s 35, is the first person to stand trial charged with manipulating the rates, known as Libor. He was described by the prosecution as the ringmaster. The former UBS and Citigroup trader denies eight counts of conspiracy to defraud from 2006 to 2010. Emma Simpson is at Southwark Crown Court. This is a very important high-profile trial brought by the Serious Fraud Office. Three years on since the first fines were handed out to some of our biggest financial institutions, a 35-year-old banker has gone on trial for his alleged role in the Libor scandal. MrHayes, are you confident today? Tom Hayes, the court heard he was an extremely intelligent man, a trader who generated vast profits. But his greed led to dishonesty on an enormous scale. He worked for UBS, the giant Swiss bank based in Tokyo. It’s alleged he conspired with colleagues and traders at other banks and financial firms to manipulate Libor to his financial advantage, cheating almost on a daily basis. Libor is the rate at which banks effectively borrow. It’s set in different currencies. A system based on daily submissions by the major banks. This rate determines the cost of borrowing for trillions of pounds worth of contracts around the world. The prosecutor said Hayes was the ringmaster at the very centre of the fraud. Telling others around him what to do, and in a number of cases, rewarding them for their dishonest assistance. The court heard he was arrested back in London in 2012, having been sacked by Citigroup. He went on to give 82 hours worth of interviews to the Serious Fraud Office where, it’s alleged, he admitted his guilt. The iurv alleged, he admitted his guilt. The jury was played a short recording where Hayes said: I probably deserve it sitting here. I was seen as a serial offender within this commonplace system. And he named a host of others he claimed were involved. The prosecution said that despite all the evidence Hayes now claims that what he was doing wasn’t dishonest. He denies all eight charges of conspiracy to defraud. The jury have already been shown a flow chart highlighting how the alleged conspiracy took place. They were also told in fact that was a very simple case. At its heart they would have to decide whether Tom Hayes acted honestly or dishonestly. The case is expected to last up three months. A crucial test for the Serious Fraud Office. It’s the biggest fine ever handed out to an individual, a staggering £75 million. It’s been given to Stewart Ford, former chief executive of Keydata Investment Services, a company which sold so-called death bonds. The Financial Conduct Authority shut the company down after many pensioners lost their life savings. Our personal finance correspondent Simon Gompertz is here. What is a death bond, what’s supposed to have happened here? It’s a share in a pool of people’s life assurance policies and these were in the United States so people sold on their life assurance policies and as they died there was an income for the fund and that was divided in bonds to over 30,000 investors in the UK. Now offering that is not necessarily illegal or anything, it’s that they were offered to be sold in tax-free individual savings accounts so they didn’t qualify and so what the regulator is saying about Stewart Ford is that he and two colleagues didn’t disclose commissions properly. They didn’t then disclose there were problems in the portfolio, in the financial value of it and deliberately misled the FC over it and through this process which between about 2006 to 2009, he Erned around £72 million in fees and commissions so you can see where the £75 million fine comes from. It’s a huge fine. What does he say? I havejust come off from. It’s a huge fine. What does he say? I have just come off the say? I havejust come off the phone to him and he said they’ve cast me as some sort of villain which is ridiculous. He rejects the fine which he can now contest in the High Court and he’s bringing a counterclaim saying that the regulator, the FCA, brought down his business by their action and that claim is for £650 million. Thank you very much. Scotland’s First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has used her first major speech since the election to attack the ""scale and speed"" of the spending cuts planned by the Conservatives. Speaking ahead of the Oueen’s Speech tomorrow, the SNP leader also reiterated her support for Britain staying in the European Union. Our Scotland Correspondent james Cook reports. This report contains flash photography. This is the closest I will ever to this trophy. She certainly knows about winning. But after a landslide victory in the election, Nicola Sturgeon still finds herself in opposition. Today, she came to the home of Heart Midlothian football club to oppose the planned cuts in public spending. We will continue to oppose spending reductions of the scale and speed that the UK Government has suggested. We believe that these will slow economic recovery and make deficit reduction more difficult. Nicola Sturgeon wants to promote partnership between employers workers and business. These bosses have signed up. Promising to pay a higher minimum wage and help their communities. A lot of small business owners are keen to pay their staff a decent wage but I think there is a lot of work to still be done by the Government and businesses together to work out how they’re going to do that. The First Minister also has business backing for her stance on the European Union. 300,000 jobs in Scotland are dependent in one way or another of membership of the single market. It would be folly in my view to put that at risk in the way David Cameron is. We will be making the positive case for the UK and Scotland as part of that to stay within the European Union. She insists EU membership is vital for growth. The UK should not quit if Scotland votes to stay, she says. On public spending she has a similar message. An alternative to austerity was at the heart of the Scottish National Party’s stunningly successful general election campaign. Of course, the UK as a whole voted for a Conservative Government, committed to further spending cuts. It gives the SNP the opportunity to argue that Scotland is different. A crucial vote over welfare reform is due to be held at Stormont later. Disagreements over the issue are threatening the future of power-sharing in Northern Ireland. The meeting is going ahead despite Northern Ireland first minister Peter Robinson’s admission to hospital with a suspected heart attack yesterday. Our correspondent Chris Buckler is there. On one level this dispute is about relatively small sums of money, how much people are paid in benefits. But together they add up to a great problem for Stormont. Westminster has made clear that if the parties here cannot agree on welfare reform they will have to foot the bill. The Democratic Unionist Party has made clear that makes any budget unworkable because the shortfall adds up to hundreds of millions of pounds. American tourists were visiting Stormont this morning. Keen to see the historic building and the Northern Ireland Assembly in action. But for how long will they have that opportunity? The future of the Assembly is threatened over the issue of welfare reform. We all as... If there aren’t changes to benefits, the DUP say they won’t have enough money to agree a budget. But nationalist parties are insisting on blocking the introduction of what they’ve described as Tory cuts. There is still time for the parties and the British Government to change tack and deliver a new budget that delivers for our public services, our economy, and our people. If a choice has to be made, to stand side by side with the Tories, or stand up for the people here for our economy, and public services... Parts of Northern Ireland are among the most deprived in the UK. As an election issue benefits matter. Stormont have responsibility for welfare. issue benefits matter. Stormont have responsibility forwelfare. However, if they don’t make cuts, the Treasury at Westminster have made clear that it’s Belfast, not London, that must pay. The DUP says if there is no reform, there will be a 6 o £00 million -- is no reform, there will be a 6 o £00 million -- £600 million hole in the budget. And that’s not workable. If people will not face up to reality in Sinn Fein and elements of of the SDLP, it’s over to the British Government. It’s over to them to say what they’re going to do and in ourview them to say what they’re going to do and in our view they have to step in and take welfare reform powers. Northern Ireland’s First Minister is absent from the debate. Peter Robinson is being treated in hospital after having a suspected heart attack. When he returns to work it’s simply unclear what state Stormont will be in. For American visitors who have been told about the peace process and political progress, that came as quite a surprise. We would hate to see that happen. It’s always good when people meet and converse and come to an amicable conclusion. When the tourists leave, Northern Ireland’s problems will remain and so will the divides at Stormont. The big question is what happens next? To be frank, some of the politicians don’t seem to know themselves. They do want Westminster to intervene but to be frank, with the Conservative Government facing pressure from Scotland about spending cuts and money they might be reluctant to do that, particularly if it involves offering cash. The Iraqi army says it has launched a wide-ranging attack on Islamic State militants to take back the city of Ramadi in Anbar province. The fall of the city shocked many in the region. No more so than injordan which neighbours Anbar and is on the front line battling the jihadists. Our security correspondent Frank Gardner reports from the Iraqi-jordanian border. Out of the barracks and on to patrol, part ofjordan’s recently formed brigade. The jordan’s desert border with Iraq here is the closest that the forces of Islamic State have come so far to getting into this pro-western kingdom. But long-term, jordan is definitely in their sights. That’s why in the last year the jordanian police and army patrols have been redoubled, notjust here on the Iraqi border, but furtherto redoubled, notjust here on the Iraqi border, but further to the north on the Syrian border where jordan faces three different armed groups. We have a good plan, a good strategy to face all the terror and to face all the challenge and all the threats. But not quite good enough, it seems. This was a recent attack by suspected jihadists on a Government vehicle. Since our visit, the King has replaced all three top men in internal security. jordan’s capital does not look or feel like a city in a country at war. Yet technically it is, with With Islamic State. How safe dojordan’s public With Islamic State. How safe do jordan’s public feel? How safe dojordan’s public feel? I went to this cafe to ask a random group for a snapshot of their opinions. We know there is problems around us but insidejordan itself we don’t have any problem. It’s very secure. What I asked aboutjordan’s extremist symphathisers? Supporters should be out like ISIS out. But this transskwil scene is deceptive. In this violent region jordan faces enemies inside and out. Even its western allies fear it could be the jihadists next big target. After a difficult period in terms of customer services Ryanair says it’s now listening to its passengers and today it’s reaping the benefits. The airline’s profits are up following a revamp of its image and moves to attract business customers. The budget airline says earnings have increased by 66% on the previous year. Well, our transport correspondent Richard Westcott is with me. They’re impressive figures. They are. Let’s look at the best ones really. £611+ million, that’s the actual profits, up from 370 I think last year, so a big jump. The next figure is the interesting one. 88%, they call this load factors. That effectively means is the aircraft are more full. For every 100 seats they’ve 88 of them full before it was 83, so the more people you have got, the more money you make. This charm offensive they launched a couple of years ago seems to be attracting people back, even by their standards, they’ve had a big hike in the number of people going on their planes. Is that all that’s behind this? It’s the big factor in it. But it’s notjust being nice, it’s notjust saying, hello, when you get on the plane. It’s concrete things. They’ve a nicer website they’ve revamped, they’ve an app, you can have a seat now, it was a big thing for a lot of people. They’re not draconian about the bag rules and that used to stress people out. A fraction over and I will be charged a fortune. It’s concrete things. We can say it’s being nice but it’s concrete things which mean people are clearly happier flying with them. Our top story this lunchtime, the trial of a former City trader accused of rate-rigging has been told he was motivated by greed. And still to come, light at the end of the tunnel for Britain’s wildlife? How the earth from a rail project is going to build Europe’s largest nature reserve. Coming up in the sport, after success in the first test against New Zealand at Lord’s, Trevor Bayliss is likely to be the man to build on the feel-good factor in England cricket by being named as the new head coach. A deadly heatwave in India is showing no sign of easing. More than 500 people have been killed and that figure is rising. With temperatures reaching A8 degrees Celsius the authorities are urging people to stay indoors and drink plenty of water. Most of the deaths are in the southern states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. jon Brain reports. In Delhi today you can see the heat as well as feel it. For most it is a struggle just to be outside. For those who have to work in these conditions, it is intolerable. TRANSLATION: I have to work to feed myself, whether it is hot or whatever, I must work. Iam myself, whether it is hot or whatever, I must work. I am a cleaner, I have to look after my children, get food for the family, I have no option but to work in this heat. Ourvehicles have no option but to work in this heat. Our vehicles are breaking down all the time. He says they are sweating so much, their throats are drying up much of the country is in the grip of temperatures heading towards 50 Celsius. This is Andhra Pradesh, hundreds have died, others have been hospitalised. Authorities are urging people to keep drinking fluids. They say the best course of action is to stay indoors and await cooler temperatures. And it’s notjust in India. There’s been severe weather in the south-west of the United States and northern Mexico where at least 19 people have been killed amidst widespread destruction. Most of the deaths are in the Mexican border city of Acuna where a tornado struck. In Texas, three people died, another 12 are reported missing after floodwaters swept away their holiday home. Naomi Grimley reports. This is the worst flooding ever recorded in Texas. For this couple, there is no alternative but to abandon their car in the middle of Houston and head for cover. 37 counties in the state have been declared disaster areas because of the swollen Blanco River. Oh my God! Its surging waters have seen cars swept downstream. There are even reports of homes being carried away by the force of the water. You could hear the house move off the foundation and Gordon said, here comes my house. Within a matter of minutes, his house floated by. At least 12 people are missing as a result of the storms and subsequent flooding. Dozens of helicopters have been scanning the worst affected parts and plucking the lucky ones to safety in dramatic rescue operations. Meanwhile, the National Guard have been drafted in to pick their way through the piles of debris now mounting up on river banks. With so many uprooted trees, most of what they find is crushed and mangled. The authorities in Texas say the waters have been tsunami-like and more rain could make it worse still. People across the state need to understand that what we have seen here in Hayes County is going to be, possibly could effect other counties downstream. These river basins all the way down to the Gulf of Mexico. And just over the border in Mexico, a freak tornado wreaked havoc in the city of Acuna. 13 people were killed, 700 homes destroyed. The storm took a matter of minutes to pass through here but the devastation will take weeks, even months, to clean up. A father of three who had developed a tumour has died at the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland. jeffrey Spector, who was 54 and from Lancashire, died on Friday following a six-year illness. He reportedly said that the condition was affecting his nervous system. Our correspondent Ed Thomas has more. A happy family, together for one last time. 16 hours after this picture, jeffrey Spector made the decision to end his life. He was diagnosed with inoperable tumour that could have left him paralysed from the neck down. It was the end of a long battle. I Linda has known him for more than 20 years, she describes a kind, caring and brave man. He wasjust describes a kind, caring and brave man. He was just such a wonderful man and he has fought it every step of the way, I have never known someone try so hard. I’m very sad to hear it, but I don’t blame him for a minute if that’s what he wanted to do. It is no one else’s decision but his own. In an interview before he died, he explained why he decided to take his life. jeffrey Spector was helped to die by Dignitas in Switzerland, a place where assisted suicide is legal. Every month, two Britain’s come here to do the same, a number that is too high for some. As a decided we want to send a different message to people, saying that we are going to utility, notjust to people, saying that we are going to utility, not just to die. jeffrey Spector said his illness had got worse and he could be struck by neck down paralysis at any time. For people who don’t agree with what he did, what would you say to them? I would say, walk a mile in someone else’s shoes before you make that decision. Nobody can pass a judgement like that unless they are going through what he has been going through. The family described their grief as all consuming but say they supported his decision 100%. Police say they’re not looking for anyone else in connection with a triple murder in Didcot in Oxfordshire after finding the body of their suspect about 15 miles away in Oxford. 21-year-old jed Allen was wanted for killing his young sister, his mother and her partner who were all stabbed to death. Andy Moore is in Didcot for us. The police investigation into what happened here on Saturday when those three bodies were discovered continues. Police will have to prepare a report for the coroner, there will be an inquest to try to establish what happened. There will also be another postmortem examination today onjed Allen so we might find out how he died. His body was found in woodland yesterday close to Oxford city centre by two members of the public. It was an area that had not been searched by police although they had been searching pretty intensively about a mile away yesterday and on Sunday in Oxford parks, wherejed Allen formerly worked as a groundsman. What could have motivated this man to apparently commit these murders, we may never know. He worked as a gardener for the Council, they say he was a model employee, always cheerful. On his social media postings, a different picture emerges. He was fascinated by the fantasy character Wolverine, he posed for photographs with a knife and an axe. just before he died, it was said he sent text messages to his friends saying he had done something bad. The energy watchdog, Ofgem, is launching an investigation into the number of gas and electric prepayment meters forcibly installed into the homes of people who’ve fallen behind with their bills. Figures obtained by BBC Radio 5 Live have revealed that half a million meters have been fitted by order of a court warrant since 2009. The energy firms insist they’re only ever used as a last resort. Nina Warhurst has more. Kaylee’s putting £12 in her prepayment gas meter so she can make lunch for her daughter, and some of that money will go on her energy debts of more than £1,000. Her supplier went to court to have the meter installed after attempts to negotiate a repayment scheme failed. I was having to clothe Lydia and put shoes on herfeet, and also having to pay my council tax and TV licence bills that I could go to prison for, and I didn’t want to go to prison and lose my daughter. The gas and electric company might say you got into that debt, this is your fault, you have to deal with the consequences. I know. I admit it’s my fault, but it’s one of those things where you think, what’s more important? The energy regulator, Ofgem, told us that prepayment meters should only ever be installed as a last resort, and even then, it’s up to the supplier to prove to the court that it’s safe and practical for the customer to use it. They say they’ve now launched an investigation into why so many of these meters are being fitted. Last year, a total of more than 97,000 prepayment meters were fitted, and since 2009, across Great Britain, more than half a million have been installed. The big energy companies say they do everything they can to support customers who are struggling. This site in Tameside, Greater Manchester, is entirely dedicated to working out affordable plans and sometimes even writing off debt. My advice to any British Gas customer is, if you are experiencing difficulty or you’re worried about paying your bills, talk to us as quickly as you can. There will be more we can do to help you keep on track rather than try to recover a situation later. The cheapest tariff is still reserved exclusively for those who can pay directly by direct debit. What would you say to sharing that tariff with those who need it most? We do a lot for pay-as-you-go customers, and the tariff is the same as our standard variable tariff. But they still pay more per unit than a direct debit customer. They do pay slightly more on the face of it, but equally, that ability to spread out the budget and prevent the customer from getting into difficulty is absolutely the right thing to do up front. Would it not be better for that customer to put them on the same price per unit as the direct debit? It’s more complex than that. That’s why we’ve done a lot to simplify our tariff structure. Direct debits are cheaper for the companies, and that saving is passed on to customers. But some argue that that’s a system that is flawed. We have a problem here that the poorest in society have to pay the most for their gas and electricity bills. And when you’re struggling, there is an irony, isn’t there, that then, companies go to court and force you to pay more for your gas and electricity. It’s just not logical. It’s not helping anybody. Kaylee admits that in some ways, she feels a lot more in control now that the meter has been fitted, but it could be years before her debt is paid off. The smallest and rarest marine dolphin in the world could be extinct within 15 years if protection is not stepped up. Conservationists say the remaining population of Maui’s dolphins has dropped below 50. The critically endangered species is found only in waters off New Zealand and there are calls for fishing to be banned across the dolphin’s entire habitat rather than only limited areas. You’re watching the BBC News at One. Our top story today, the trial of a former City trader accused of rate-rigging has been told he was motivated by greed. In a moment, we’ll have the weather plus the news where you are. But first with the sport here’s john Watson. Trevor Bayliss has been appointed as the new head coach of the England cricket team. The Australian will take charge in time for the first Ashes Test injuly. Working alongside caretaker Paul Farbrace, the pair will attempt to build on the current feel-good factor in the camp generated by England’s dramatic win over New Zealand yesterday. Tim Hague reports. One of the finest Test matches in recent memory ending in a fitting finale. He has taken it! Moeen’s catch the culmination five full days, a record 1610 runs and of course, Ao wickets. And it wasn’t just the fact that England won, it was the way they did in front of a packed Lord’s and overnight by bat and ball by that man. The crowd was absolutely electric, the noise was incredible and they were getting behind us the whole way. Every time something happened, they were all on theirfeet and something happened, they were all on their feet and trying to GE is something happened, they were all on theirfeet and trying to GE is up. I have never heard Lord’s like that. Stuart Broad said it was amazing and it was incredible. And perhaps there will be more incredible times under the new head coach with Australian Trevor Bayliss taking over head of the Ashes this summer. He led Sri Lanka to the World Cup final in 2011 when England’s current caretaker was his assistant. He works well with players, he is good one-to-one, knowledgeable and experienced but very calm. He doesn’t say a great deal but when he does, people listen and he is just deal but when he does, people listen and he isjust a good, straightforward critic man and if he does take the job he is an excellent choice. It is him although it remains to be seen if he is an excellent choice but there is no doubt about this, the gloom around the England cricket team is beginning to lift. They call it the most lucrative game in football. No wonder then Norwich City were celebrating as they secured their return to the Premier League with victory in the Championship play-off final yesterday. They beat Middlesbrough 2-0 to line UP a potential £120 million windfall. Both goals came in the first 15 minutes. Nathan Redmond with his side’s second, to help Norwich bounce back up the first time of asking. Theyjoin Bournemouth and Watford in the top flight. Worked so hard to get to a stadium like this. Doesn’t happen often. Last thing you want is the players to go on the pitch and freeze or maybe think you could have done more. Go and enjoy the game, enjoy the occasion. Let’s hope he has dried off! . Both the women’s and men’s British number one Heather Watson and Andy Murray are through to the second round of the French Open. As is Kyle Edmund, the British number four, who won his first Grand Slam match with a five-set victory over Frenchman Stephane Robert. Afterwards, he was grateful of the support he got at courtside from a Grand Slam champion, Andy Murray. It means a lot that he came to watch me and wants me to do well and he sent me a text saying really pleased for you, well done. You know, great achievement to win that match, the first five-setter. Yeah, it’s nice that he’s able to help me and he is still playing for more years to come so I continue to learn from him. The new IBF super-middleweight world championjames De Gale has targeted a rematch with George Groves if his rival wins a world title. De Gale made British boxing history at the weekend after beating American Andre Dirrell in Boston on a unanimous points decision to become the first British boxer to win Olympic gold and a world title. It means It mea ns everything. of ten since I started boxing that was my aim, that was my goal to be a professional world champion and it’s here. Plus, I made some history and the first gold medallist from Great Britain to win the title. I am over the moon. That’s all the sport for now. Back to you, Simon. Thank you very much. Crossrail is the new train line running from east to west across London and due to open in 2018. It includes 26 miles of tunnels but what happens to the earth that’s excavated? Well, half of it has been shipped to what will be Europe’s largest man-made nature reserve, as Andrew Bomford reports. Deep under London, enormous tunnels are being constructed. This one, Ao feet high, will become a station platform. Eight giant tunnel boring machines have chewed through miles of earth, building their own walls behind them. At station after station, the machines have broken through. But this stuff, mud, earth, clay, is normally called spoil. It is a by-product and a nuisance, something to be got rid of. Not here, though. Here it is the building block for a unique partnership between construction and wildlife. About half of the soil, 3 million tonnes, has travelled by barge up river to an RSPB nature reserve called Wallasea Island near Southend. Here it is unloaded and spread across an area twice the size of the City of London, creating sea walls, lagoons, islands and vast areas of marshland. It should be a valuable haven for plants, birds and wildlife but also provide flood protection to a coastline being threatened by rising sea levels. From deep under London to here on the Essex coast, this earth is currently holding back the sea but in about six weeks time, the sea wall here will be breached, the sea will rush in and this whole area will turn into a salt marsh. What we are creating here is Europe’s largest intertidal habitat creation project of its type. It’s one of the largest in terms of area but certainly the largest in terms of land raising so it will provide a range of different habitats, notjust for the birds but for a range of invertebrates, plants, the whole gambit really. At a time when parts of the once wild coastline are being lost, this, the biggest coastal conservation scheme ever attempted in Britain, will turn the clock back to an environment last seen here 400 years ago but, more importantly, it protects and preserves the coastline well into the future. Time for a look at the weather now. Thank you very much. You are a creature of the sun, aren’t you? Yes! Let’s get on. We were going to try something, it didn’t work. Never mind. Let’s talk about the weather for this afternoon. It’s not looking too bad for most of us. There is sunshine here across eastern areas. Down to the south, as well. It’s been a little cloudy across western parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland. Here the breeze coming off the Atlantic will keep it on the fresh side with a few showers for western Scotland. For most of us not a bad afternoon. Should be quite nice and pleasant out there. Temperatures up to around 20 or so in London. More like 15 or 16 across the Midlands and further north the fresher it gets. A bit like yesterday, around 15 or 16 there for Newcastle which isn’t too bad. The showers here across western parts of Scotland are going to continue through the day, notjust Scotland are going to continue through the day, not just the west, but in the north too. As far as tonight is concerned,ed breeze continues br to bring wet weather to Scotland. To the south of that, from around Yorkshire southwards, clearer skies, so here temperatures in some rural spots dip low enough to give a bit of ground frost first thing in the morning. From mid-week onwards this is the pattern. Looking across the Atlantic, this is the jet stream, it’s going to move weather fronts in our direction, from around about Wednesday onwards we will see a change in our weather pattern. Not necessarily straightaway in the south. This is mostly true at least on Wednesday for north-western areas. It’s going to get windy around the Pennines with a few showers. Wednesday across the south and the south-east we have temperatures of around about 20, but look at Glasgow, only ten. This sort of unsettled pattern from Wednesday onwards is going to continue into Thursday and Friday. What we are seeing is a rush of fresh cooler conditions there off the Atlantic. Sunshine and showers. Probably a little cool for the time of year. Not necessarily in London, but 13 in Newcastle and Leeds, as well. Perhaps disappointing. The same theme continues for Friday. Thatjet stream effectively brings us the fresh and showery weather. Some sunshine around, no doubt, but it’s not going to be feeling necessarily like the very end of May. On that note, back to you. Thank you very much. Nowa reminder of our top story this lunchtime. The trial of a former City trader accused of rate-rigging has been told he was motivated by greed. That’s all from us. Now on BBC One it’s time for the news where you are. Have a good afternoon. Welcome to BBC London news. I am Alex Bushill. More than eight millionjourneys on Transport for London services were taken for free last year by people who live with TfL staff. Staff can nominate one person at their address to get free travel. But critics say it has led to a loss of more than £22 million in fares last year. Susannah Mendosa reports. Tube and bus travel doesn’t come cheap in London. A yearly travelcard could set you back £2,000. Not in you live with someone who works for TfL, though. Staff are allowed to nominate one person they live with to get a free travel pass but it’s a perk that’s got this Tory mayoral hopeful hot under the collar. I don’t think Londoners want their money used financing this gold-plated perk that Londoners don’t get. It’s about time we looked at a better way of spending those resources. Transport for London figures object tabed by the London Assembly’s Conservative group reveals how many people are using the passes -- obtained. Transport for London says that’s nonsense and that the fares lost as a result amounted to no more than £7 million last year. TfL says passes like this one don’t cost it any more money because it doesn’t have to put on extra bus services or extra tube trains in orderto on extra bus services or extra tube trains in order to cope. And, crucially, it says that changing this long-standing staff benefit might actually cost more money if staff then asked for increased pay or called for strike action. That’s something the mayor busy planting a new tree at the Olympic Park today is keen to avoid. I am happy to take on the unions over something sensible. I don’t see the point in crossing the road to beat them up and pick a fight with people who work actually very hard for London. Tube users were divided on the issue. Person who works for TfL is fine, but if you have another person it’s going to be too much. I know people that get ridiculous perks because of theirjobs, this seems like a small thing in comparison. One of the unions representing tube staff sails it’s funding the Conservatives should be looking at. The real story is not that the staff and the nominated person gets this travel benefit, it’s actually the funding cuts that face London underground and TfL and we think it’s a mean attempt to divide the workforce. With the cost of travel ever higher, who does and who doesn’t get to travel for free will continue to be an issue for debate. Security staff and cleaners on London’s Docklands Light Railway are to stage a 48-hour strike in a dispute over pay and conditions. Members of the RMT union employed by Interserve will walk out from 5. 30am tomorrow after voting by 4-1 in favour of industrial action. In a separate development London black cabs are gathering outside Transport for London’s headquarters in Victoria this lunchtime ahead of a trick to begin in the next half hour. of a strike to begin in the next half hour. According to the United Cabbies Group, TfL is failing to properly regulate minicab offices. TfL says it is working to improve the taxi trade and any strike will unfairly disrupt the capital.

Actually we are looking at a nice afternoon. We have cloud just bubbling up. More out towards the west, as well.

And the Housing Minister defends plans to extend tenants’ rights to buy their own home. to be admitted to A&E. Secretary Alistair Carmichael over a leaked government memo. Good evening and welcome to the BBC news at six. A court has been told that a former city trader was acting purely out of greed when he orchestrated an enormous fraud to rig the inter-bank lending rates known as Libor. Tom Hayes, who used to work for UBS and Citigroup denies conspiring to defraud between 2006 and 2010. Libor is used in trillions of pounds worth of financial deals and the prosecution is claming that that Hayes was the ""Ringmaster"", who did ""everything in his power"" to make huge profits. His is the first of a number of cases due to come to court involving city traders and the Libor scandal. Emma Simpson is at Southwark Crown Court. This is an important high profile case, brought by the Serious Fraud Office. Three years on, since the first finds were handed out to some of our biggest financial institutions, a 35-year-old financial bank has gone on trial here for his alleged role in the Libor scandal. Tom Hayes, the court heard he was an extremely intelligent man, a star trader who learned profits that were enormous, but whose greed led to dishonesty on a grand scale. He worked in Tokyo for the Swiss banking giant, UBS and later, for Citibank before he was sacked. He earned nearly £5 million in four years. The prosecution claimed he was the ringmaster at the very centre, rigging bank rates for profit. So why does Libor matter? It is the rate at which banks effectively borrow, a benchmark that determines the cost of borrowing trillions worth of contracts for households and businesses around the world. It is based on daily submissions by the major banks. Tom Hayesis submissions by the major banks. Tom Hayes is accused of conspiring with others to rig the rate to benefit his own trading. For the prosecution, it was said:. Tom Hayes’ actions, struck at the very integrity of the Libor setting system, based here in the city of one. It is claimed he manipulated the rate almost on a daily basis, over a four-year period, not just within his own bank, but he influenced traders at other banks and financial firms, asking, begging, cajoling them to skew the rates in his favour. Paying bribes and kickbacks to some of the middlemen as a reward. Tom Hayes was arrested in London in December 2012 by the Serious Fraud Office. The court heard he voluntarily gave 82 hours worth of interviews where he allegedly admitted his guilt. The iurv allegedly admitted his guilt. The jury heard one recording in which he said... The prosecution said despite all of the evidence, Tom Hayes now claims what he was doing wasn’t dishonest. The court also heard he has a mild form of Asperger’s syndrome. He denies all eight charges of conspiracy to defraud. The family of a British father of three who has taken his own life at the Dignitas centre in Switzerland say they respect his decision though their grief is all consuming. 5li-year-old businessman, jeffrey Spector, from Lancashire believed he would become completely paralysed by an inoperable tumour on his spine. Speaking before his death on Friday he asked others not tojudge him. His case has reignited the debate about whether to legalise assisted dying. Ed Thomas reports. A happy family, together for one last time. 16 hours after this was taken, jeffrey Spector ended his life. The 5li-year-old was diagnosed with an inoperable tumour that could have paralysed him from the neck down. Friends say it was the end of a long battle. He did more to live I think than any person I have ever known. Linda has knownjeffrey for 20 years and describes a kind, caring and brave man. He wasjust such a wonderful man and he fought it every step of the way. I have never known a man try so hard. I Anne Bury sad to hear it, but I don’t blame him for a minute, if thatis don’t blame him for a minute, if that is what he wanted to do. It is no one else’s decision, but his own. In an interview before he died, jeffrey Spector explained why he took his life... In this quiet corner of Switzerland, jeffrey Spector was helped by Dignitas to end his life. He, assisted dying is legal and the place where Britain comes to Diaby two weeks. A number, but for some, is too high. As a society we want to be saying to people, we want to help you to live, notjust to die. jeffrey Spector knew his illness was getting worse and because of the law here, he said he had no option but to travel to Switzerland. But attitudes are changing and campaigners hope that terminally ill people here will have the right to choose the time and place of their death. The issue of assisted dying will be debated in the Scottish Parliament tomorrow and in England and Wales there could soon be another attempt to change the law. jeffrey Spector, asked not to be judged. He said... For people who did not agree with what he did, what would you say to them? I would say, walk and mile in someone else’s shoes before you make that decision. Nobody can pass judgement like that unless they are going through what he has been going through. The family said they grieve was all-consuming but they supported Geoffrey 100%. all-consuming but they supported Geoffrey100%. -- grief. With me now is our medical correspondent, Fergus Walsh. There was a bill about legalising assisted dying being considered at Westminster in the last parliament but it ran out of time before the election. It got further than any previous attempt to change the law in England and Wales. It would have allowed people who are terminally ill with less smug -- people who are terminally ill with less smug -- less than six months to live, of sound mind, to be given a lethal cocktail of drugs. After the speech tomorrow, there will be a ballot for the driver member’s bill and the sponsor of that bill, Lord Falconer, will try to introduce it again. It is a lottery as to whether it will happen. Opinion polls suggest the public are broadly in favour of a change in the law. One last month found 80% of people are in favour. But hundreds of returns have gone to Dignitas to die and neither side think it is acceptable. Those in favour of a change in the law, it would give people like jeffrey Spector the competent know, when they reached near their death they would get help here and would not feel compelled to go well they are still able-bodied. Those against say it is wrong and it would break the trust between doctor and patient and turn right to die into a duty to die for the weak and vulnerable. New figures suggest there’s been a big rise in cases of identity theft in the past year, up by a third. Criminals are increasingly turning to the internet to buy and sell personal data which can be used to open bank accounts, get credit cards and commit fraud in other people’s names. Angus Crawford investigates how one 80-year-old woman fell victim to the fraudsters. If you’re a gardener, you’d go to a gardening forum to ask about flowers. This is a fraud forum and people are asking about credit cards. In the darkest parts of the net, behind secret passwords, hidden forums where criminals buy and sell your personal data. Yep, it’s a marketplace. People are buying, selling, giving away things, exchanging tips. This online investigator says credit cards and passports, emails and passwords - anything and everything is up for sale. You can buy a credit card with date of birth for only about £5? That’s correct. Yeah. That’s going to be a real credit card that will work? It will work, yeah. Someone, the real owner, will be a victim? They will lose money? Certainly, yes. One of the identities being bought and sold by criminals online belongs to an 80-year-old woman who lives in this estate in Wales. Apparently, she has an H&M account and someone is using it to buy clothes. Barbara Evans and her husband have never even heard of H&M, so what’s going on? It seems the criminals used a stolen passport to open a credit account in Barbara’s name. They then changed the delivery address. Goods are bought using her identity, but sent to a flat in London. Now, you don’t live in a tower block in south-east London do you? Never have, never will. No, never. This is where the fraudsters say Barbara now lives. So we decided to send her a parcel ourselves. This man confirms that she does live here. Horrible day. Hiya. So, it’s for Barbara Evans. Right, Barbara Evans lives in 28? Yeah. OK. There you go. Can Ijust give you that to sign. We don’t know if this is the person who’s been shopping online in Barbara’s name, but he does accept our parcel. Thank you very much. And Barbara’s not alone, new figures show that in the first three months of 2014, more than 24,000 people were victims of ID theft. In the same period this year, that had gone up to more than 32,000. A rise of 31% injust a year. But the numbers don’t tell the full story of the anguish behind the statistics. You’re going to be spending an awful lot of time trying to get the money back. You may still be liable for it and there have been many cases where people have had to pay bills, even though it’s had nothing to do with them in the first place, and that is traumatic. We tend to ignore it, but I look at it as though if you were robbed, and your house was burgled, the mental anguish you go through is quite severe. I don’t believe this is any different. But what about the man who signed for the parcel addressed to Barbara Evans? He denies having any involvement. I don’t know anybody called Barbara. She’s an old lady who’s very ill. I don’t know anything about that. The truth is, we’ll probably never know who stole the identity of a frail, old woman to line their own pockets. Have you got something to say about that. (BLEEP).

The Financial Conduct Authority says it will issue its largest ever fine against an individual, for misleading investors into buying second-hand life insurance policies, known as ""death bonds"". Stewart Ford - who was the Chief Executive of the collapsed investment firm Keydata - has been ordered to pay £75 million. The FCA said the bonds were not suitable for private investors, and that Mr Ford had acted without integrity. There’s a growing political crisis in Northern Ireland, a final agreement on a budget is being held up by a row over welfare reform. The Democratic Unionists are trying to bring about changes introduced by the Westminster Government, but Sinn Fein says the reforms ""attack society’s most vulnerable."" The stalemate has already cost Stormont tens of millions of pounds in fines. Our Ireland correspondent, Chris Buckler, is there. What’s causing the deadlock? What happens next? are continuing to debate the Welfare Reform Bill. But it doesn’t matter the SDLP, Sinn Fein and the Green party have signed a petition of concern, a veto which will block the introduction of benefit changes that had been seen in England, Scotland and Wales, from coming into place in Northern Ireland. The Treasury have made it clear, if it is the case, storm on is will have to pay the difference, not London. As a result they are already finding the ministers here millions of pounds a week. The DUP say combining that with other pressures, they are facing a shortfall of £600 million and they don’t know how a budget is workable in those circumstances. What is likely to happen yebth in Politicians have been asking the same question. Civil servants could administer budgets. That would raise questions about the future of power-sharing. The DUP is calling for the Conservatives to return responsibility of welfare to Westminster. That would be controversial and it would be complicated to remove a devolved power from Westminster. This complicated to remove a devolved powerfrom Westminster. This is power from Westminster. This is all of course taking place as Northern Ireland’s First Minister, Peter Robinson, remains in hospital after suffering a suspected heart attack yesterday. It’s not clear that when he returns to work what state or how Stormont will be functioning. Thank you very much.

And bringing part of London to a standstill. How cabbies aren’t the only ones protesting today. Barack Obama has this evening criticised what he called Russia’s ""increasingly aggressive stance"" on Ukraine. His comments come as the conflict enters its second year. A ceasefire - nominally in place since February - has not stopped the violence completely as government and rebel forces continue to fight across the front line in several areas around Donetsk Airport. Among the hardest hit is the village of Pisky, where only a handful of residents are left out of 3,000 who lived there before the war started. Our special correspondent, Fergal Keane, has been covering the fighting in Pesky since the war began. The village has now been sealed off by the Ukrainian army, but he and his team were given exclusive access. The war has entered its second summer and a year has passed since we first drove down this road, where men died in the first battles and where they die still. Shells land, but this is common place on the high-speed drive into Pesky, where the war never stops. It’s mostly the old and the sick who are left behind. We were staying with Svetlana, aged 68, and with her husband, who’s the same age. Anatoli is the beekeeper of Pisky, tending the hive of his neighbours who have fled. TRANSLATION: I’m taking care of them. They’re here. How can Ijust leave them? The food that they produce, they share with elderly neighbours. The shops are too distant, the route too dangerous. TRANSLATION: It’s terrifying, before I only had a few grey hairs here. Now yOU CBFI Sââ... When I look at myself, with my glasses on, it’s terrifying. We’re really fed-up because they don’t let us go anywhere. There is no ceasefire here, and coming back to Pesky, I wondered why Anatoli and Svetlana refuse to leave. TRANSLATION: just take a look. If I go to a city, I will be under shelling as well. When I’m on my way there somebody could shoot me or steal my car, anything can happen. Anatoli did evacuate Svetlana to the city but, together since they were 16, separation was too hard. TRANSLATION: When he was alone here, every morning and evening we called each other. I had a strong pain in my soul, and so did he. He was a lonely man here because all the neighbours moved away. Can Ijust ask you, what does she mean to you? TRANSLATION: How can I explain what she means to me? She’s here. By night, soldiers shoot up at the drones that are scanning the ground for targets. Nearby, the Ukrainians launch shells at rebel positions. Anatoli and Svetlana have gone to bed, they’re asleep, because for them, this utterly abnormal situation that’s taking place all around them, this is normal now. Morning, and time to check on an older neighbour. Sonia, aged 77, is gathering fodder for her cow. She lives with her severely disabled son and says there’s nowhere else she can take him. TRANSLATION: Don’t be afraid. I will not give you away to anybody. Don’t be afraid, my little one. CRYING. Don’t be afraid, my baby. The politicians broke the country into pieces. This poor Ukraine, just broken into pieces. But there are strong bonds of love here. In war you meet all kinds of people, but you are some of the nicest people I’ve ever met, and certainly the bravest. ""Stay safe"", they replied. Anatoli and Svetlana, keeping alive the struggle of decent people. Fergal Keane, BBC News, Pesky. Tomorrow, the Queen will perform the annual State Opening of Parliament, the start of a new session following the Conservatives’ victory at the general election. It’s the first time for nearly 20 years that a Tory majority Government will present the legislation it intends to introduce over the next year. With an EU referendum and a decision over the Human Rights Act looming, our deputy political editor has a look at what’s in store. The streets are closed, the security tightened, the cavalry as rehearsed as the broadcasters. Tomorrow, Parliament will be opened by the Queen with full pomp and pageantry and we’ll find out which election promises the Government wants to implement quickly and those it’s happy to put on hold. My Lords and members of the House of Commons. The last time the Queen read out a list of purely Conservative measures was almost 20 years ago, whenjohn Major was in charge. Now, she’ll do the same from today’s Tory Government, unrestrained by coalition. That means that we can govern as a one-nation Government for all hard-working people, offering security and opportunity for everyone, at every stage of their lives. So the Queen’s Speech will echo much of the Tory manifesto. There’ll be measures to give more than a million Housing Association tenants the right-to-buy their homes at a discount and to give twice as much free childcare for parents of three and four-year-olds. There’ll be new laws to stop the Government raising national insurance, VAT and income tax rates and to give the police the power to seize the wages of illegal immigrants. What these Cabinet ministers know is they have only a small majority in the House of Commons to get these measures through, and while Labour may be distracted by a leadership contest, it remains the official opposition. There’ll be lots of language about fairness and working people, but actually it’s the detail that matters. Who’s going to be affected? Who’s going to be paying the price for those cuts, for those unfunded pledges? That’s ourjob, as a strong opposition, and we’ll be watching the small print very closely indeed. David Cameron will face perhaps his greatest battle over Britain’s place in the European Union, over the details of his planned referendum, such as what question voters will be asked. There’ll be opposition to his plans to break the formal link between the European Court of Human Rights, here in Strasbourg, with the courts in Britain, by scrapping The Human Rights Act. I would be extremely wary, particularly under a Conservative Government, of withdrawing from the European Convention which we set up after the war. As for the Bill giving new powers for the Scottish Parliament over taxes and welfare, the SNP will push for more. But perhaps the greatest opposition to this Queen’s Speech will come from in here, the House of Lords, where the Government has no majority and Labour and Lib Dem peers are already organising to take the battle to this Government. Today, Madame Tussaud’s unveiled its updated wax figure of David Cameron with more lines and grey hair. They might need even more in another five years. james Landale, BBC News, Westminster. The Nigerian striker, Asisat Oshoala, has been named as the winner of the first ever BBC Women’s Footballer of the Year competition.

The England cricket team has chosen an Australian to lead its campaign to win back the Ashes. Trevor Bayliss willjoin as coach next month. Andy Swiss reports. Crisis, what crisis? Has he taken it? Yes, he has. Afterallthe turmoil, triumph at last, but if England’s win over New Zealand yesterday began restoring the feel-good factor, it’s up to this man to complete the job. At 52, Trevor Bayliss blends experience with expertise and the result is a hugely impressive CV. He guided row are lank ya to the World Cup final four years ago and expelled in T20 cricket where he won Premier League twice. The man who will be his assistant is right behind him. He is a calm guy. Doesn’t say a great deal. When he does, people listen. I just think he’s experienced around the world. What he has won. What he has achieved with players is fantastic. Tomorrow, England’s players fantastic. Tomorrow, England’s players will gather here at Headingley to prepare for their next match starting on Friday. 2015 hasn’t been easy, they will come here with new confidence and the prospect of a new coach. One who is Australian and whose first task is, yes, to beat Australia. His compatriots whitewashed England last year. Bayliss coached many of them. Any danger of divided loyalties. I would like to think any coach that signed up for the England cricket team is loyal and devoted to the England cricket team. I see it as a positive really. You can get a look into the Australian mentality and an Australian approach and way of thinking. That is only going to be of benefit. One possible worry, like Peter Moores never played at international level. England will hope a little help from Down Under can get them back to the top. Andy Swiss, BBC News.

Rave That’s all from the BBC News at Six, so it’s goodbye from me, Calls to scrap free bus and tube travel for family and friends of Transport for London staff. I don’t think Londoners want their money used financing this gold-plated perk that Londoners just don’t get. But the Mayor has defended the scheme and says it’s not worth upsetting the staff. Also tonight. The Government’s plans to extend the Right to Buy scheme to housing association tenants but will it solve the capital’s housing crisis? How earth excavated from Crossrail tunnels is helping our wildlife. And the exhibition where the lights never go out. The neon glow of Soho. Good evening. Welcome to BBC London News with me Riz Lateef. People who live with Transport for London staff are getting free travel on tubes and buses costing Londoners around £20 million a year. That’s according to figures from the Conservatives on the London Assembly. They say that money should either be ploughed back in to infrastructure or given to other public sector workers who have to pay for their travel. The Mayor says to change the rules simply isn’t worth the bother while TfL dispute the figures. Susana Mendonca reports. Tube and bus travel does not come cheap in London. A yearly travelcard could set you back two grand. Not if you live with someone who works for TfL, though, because staff are allowed to nominate one person they live with to get a free travel pass, but it’s a perk that’s got this Tory mayoral hopeful hot under the collar. I don’t think Londoners want their money used financing this gold-plated perk that Londoners just don’t get. And it’s about time we looked at a better way of spending those resources. Transport for London figures obtained by the London Assembly’s Conservative group reveals just how many people are using the nominee passes. Almost 8.5 million journeys were made by people issued with them in the last financial year. The Conservatives say that could have amounted to more than £22 million in fares if the journeys had beem charged for. the journeys had been charged for. But Transport for London says that’s nonsense. and the fares lost as a result amounts to no more than £7 million last year. TfL says norminee passes like this one don’t actually cost any more money because it doesn’t have to put on extra bus services or extra tube trains in order to cope and crucially, it says that changing this long-standing staff benefit might actually cost more money if staff then ask for increased pay or call for strike action. That’s something the Mayor, busy planting a new tree at the Olympic Park today, is keen to avoid. I’m very happy to take on the unions over something sensible. I don’t see the point in crossing the road to beat them up and pick a fight with people who work actually very hard for London. But tube users were divided on the issue. The person who works for TfL, it’s fine, but if you’ve got more than one person, I think it’s too much. I know people that get ridiculous perks because of theirjobs so this seems quite a small thing in comparison. One of the unions representing tube staff says it’s funding the Conservatives should be looking at. The real story here is not that the staff and their nominated person gets this travel benefit. It’s actually the funding cuts that face London Underground and TfL, and we think it is a mean attempt to divide the workforce. With the cost of travel ever higher, who does and who doesn’t get to travel for free will continue to be an issue for debate. And Susana’s at Great Portland Street station for us now. Put this into context in terms of perks of other workers. Well, this is a relatively small number in terms of TfL budgets, but it is the principle here about whether or not public sector workers should get more perks than others which is being brought into question. In the private sector, a lot of companies offer perks. Rail companies give them some defy percent for their ",,

And, the housing minister defends plans to extend the right to buy to include housing-association tenants. Good evening. The first criminal trial linked to the rigging of a key interest rate is underway. Tom Hayes, a former City trader, is accused of acting in a thoroughly dishonest manner in his alleged attempts to rig the so-called Libor rate. He denies eight counts of conspiracy to defraud. Libor is an interest rate used by banks around the world to set the price of financial products worth billions of pounds. Tom Hayes was described by prosecutors as the ringmaster at the heart of a global network of corrupt traders as our correspondent, Emma Simpson, reports. Are you confident today? Tom Hayes, the court heard he was an extremely intelligent man, a star trader, who earned profits that were simply enormous, but whose greed led to dishonesty on a grand scale. He worked in Tokyo for the Swiss banking giant UBS, and later briefly for Citibank, before he was sacked. He earned nearly £5 million in four years. The prosecution claimed he was the ring master at the very centre, rigging bank rates for profit. Libor matters because it is the rate at which banks effectively borrow, a benchmark that decides the cost of borrowing for trillions of pounds’ worth of contracts for households and businesses around the world. It is collated daily from estimates submitted by the major banks. He is accused of conspiring with others to rig the rate to benefit his own trading. His actions, he said, struck at the very integrity of the Libor-setting system, based here in the City of London. It is claimed he manipulated the rate almost on a daily basis over a four-year period, not just within his own bank, but that he influenced traders at other banks and financial firms, asking, begging, cajoling them to skew the rates in his favour, paying bribes and kickbacks to some of the middlemen as a reward. Tom Hayes was arrested in London in December 2012 by the Serious Fraud Office. The court heard he voluntarily gave 82 hours’ worth of interviews, where he allegedly admitted his guilt. The jury heard one recording in which he said... The prosecution said that despite all the evidence, he now claims that what he was doing was not dishonest. The court also heard he has a mild form of Asperger’s syndrome. He denies all eight charges of conspiracy to defraud, in a case that is expected to last up to three months. A man from Lancashire who feared he would be paralysed by an inoperable tumour has died at the Dignitas Centre in Switzerland. jeffrey Spector was 54 and died last Friday following a long illness.

I’m very sad to hear it, but I don’t blame him for a minute if that’s what he wanted to do. It’s no-one else’s decision but his own. In an interview before he died, jeffrey Spector explained why he took his life. In this quiet corner of Switzerland, jeffrey Spector was helped by Dignitas to end his life. Here, assisted dying is legal and a place where a Briton comes to die every two weeks. A number that for some is too high. We would say, as a society, we want to be sending a different message to people. We want to be saying to them, we’re going to help you to live, not just to die. jeffery Spector knew his illness was getting worse and because of the law here, he said he had no option but to travel to Switzerland. But attitudes are changing. Campaigners hope that terminally ill people here will soon have the right to choose the time and place of their death. The issue of assisted dying will be debated in the Scottish Parliament tomorrow and in England and Wales there could soon be another attempt to change the law. jeffrey Spector asks not to be judged. For people who don’t agree with what he did, what would you say to them? I would say, walk a mile in someone else’s shoes before you make that decision, really. Nobody can pass a judgement like that unless they’re going through what he’s been going through. The Spectors said that their grief was all-consuming, but that they supported jeffrey 100%. Let’s talk a bit more about attempts to legislate, where are we? At Westminster in the last session, a bill got further than any previous attempt to change the law in England and Wales, but it ran out of time. It would have allowed people of sound mind with less than six months to live the right to a lethal prescription of trucks. There will be a ballot after the Queen’s Speech, but it is a lottery as to whether it is going to get selected. In the Scottish Parliament tomorrow, MSPs will vote on the first step towards a similar bill. There has been some shift in political opinion, but it is a hugely divisive issue and there is still a mountain to climb before any registration study chance of being passed. It would not have helped had people like Geoffrey Specter immediately, but it would have meant people like him would not have felt the need to travel abroad while they were still able-bodied. Opponents say it is fundamentally wrong, it would break the bond of trust between doctor and patient, turned the right to die into the duty to die, and there is help at the end of life in the form of palliative care. New figures suggest that identity theft is on the rise. Over the past year, there’s been a 31% rise in the number of people falling victim. A BBC investigation has found that criminals are using internet forums to buy and sell personal data in order to open bank accounts, get credit cards and commit fraud in other people’s names. If you are a gardener, you would go to a gardening forum, ask about flowers. This is a fraud forum. In the darkest part of the net, hidden forums where criminals purchase and sell your personal data. It is a marketplace, people purchasing, selling, giving away things, exchanging tips. This investigator says credit cards and passports, e-mails and passwords, anything and everything is up for sale. You can purchase a credit card with date of birth for only about £5. That is going to be a real credit card that will work? And somebody, the owner, will be a victim, they will lose money? Yes. One of the identities being purchased and sold online belongs to an 80-year-old woman who lives in this estate in Wales. Apparently, she has an H&M account, and somebody is using it to buy clothes. Barbara Evans and her husband have never even heard of H&M. What is going on? It seems the criminals used a stolen passport to open a credit account in her name. They then changed the delivery address, goods are purchased using her identity, and sent to a flat in London. You do not live in a tower block in south-east London. Never have, never will. OK. This is where the fraudsters say she now lives. We decided to send her a parcel ourselves. This man confirms that she does live here. It is for Barbara Evans. Barbara Evans lives in number 28? Yes. There you go. We do not know if this is the person who has been shopping online in her name. But he does accept our parcel. Thank you very much. Barbara is not alone, new figures show that in the first three months of 2014, more than 24,000 people were victims of identity theft. In the same period this year, that had gone up to more than 32,000. A rise of 31% injust a year. But the numbers do not tell the full story of the anguish behind the statistics. You will spend a lot of time trying to get the money back, you may still be liable, and in many cases people have had to pay bills even though it has had nothing to do with them. It is traumatic. We tend to ignore it, but if you were robbed and your house was burgled, the mental anguish is quite severe, Ido not believe this is any different. What about the man who signed for the parcel addressed to Barbara Evans? He denies having any involvement. She is very ill. Ido not know anything about that. We will probably never know who stole the identity of a frail old woman to line their own pockets. Have you got something to say about that? BLEEP. Iraqi television has formally announced the start of a military offensive intended to drive Islamic State militants out of the western province of Anbar. This follows IS’s recent capture of the provincial capital, Ramadi. Pro-government forces have been massing for a counter attack and there are now reports of fighting to the south and west of the city. There’s political deadlock tonight in the Northern Ireland Assembly -- after the Welfare Reform Bill was in effect blocked by Sinn Fein and the SDLP. Westminster has ordered the Stormont Assembly to pass the proposals -- but Sinn Fein says the changes ‘attack society’s most vulnerable’. For the latest on the deadlock -- let’sjoin our correspondent Chris Buckler in Belfast. The result doesn’t matter. Nationalists used a Petition of Concern effectively to veto the result and tonight unionists are furious. They say the effect on Northern Ireland and Stormont will be much more severe than the impact of the proposed reforms. There are families who rely on benefits for the essentials. Talk of changes to welfare worries them. It’s a problem. This after school is on the outskirts of North Belfast. It’s run by Barnard Yeos the charity says it is working with some parents who see themselves as living on the breadline. People are now concerned about how how much money they have to live on. You are down to your bread and your butter, like. I mean, that’s your life. Of course, they now watch this space to see what’s going to happen. Some cuts and changes to benefits in other parts of the UK have so far not been introduced in Northern Ireland. The Treasury says that the pop ‘tises here need to take responsibility for the difference paid to claimants. Currently, Stormont is facing fines totallying around £2 million a week. That combined with other pressures means the power-sharing Government faces a £600 million shortfall in its budget. The battle over how to deal with that has damaged the always fragile relationships in Stormont. Unionists pushed for welfare reform legislation to be passed in the Assembly today. Sinn Fein was among the parties to sign what’s called a ""Petition of Concern"" infect, a veto blocking any change. There are still time for the parties, and the British Government, to change tact and to deliver a new budget that delivers for our public services, our economy and our people. American tourists were among the visitors to Stormont today, there to see the grand building and the Northern Ireland Assembly in action. For how long will they have that opportunity? The failure to deal with welfare means Stormont’s future is again under threat. If people will not face up to economic and political reality in Sinn Fein and elements of the SDLP, then it is over to the British Government. It is over to them to say what they’re going to do. In our view, they have to step in and take welfare reform powers. Sinn Fein has fought election campaigns on both sides of the Irish border, on a message that they will fight austerity. Across the UK cuts are a reality and at Stormont they are going to have to find a way with dealing with them if the Assembly is to survive. Chris Buckler, BBC News, Belfast. President Obama has criticised what he called Russia’s ""increasingly aggressive stance"" on Ukraine. A ceasefire - nominally in place since February - has not ended the violence as government and rebel forces continue to fight in several areas around Donetsk Airport. Among the hardest hit is the village of Pesky, where only a handful of residents are left out of 3,000 who lived there before the war started. Our special correspondent, Fergal Keane, and cameraman, Tony Fallshaw, has been covering the fighting in Pesky since the conflict began. The village has now been sealed off by the Ukrainian army, but he and his team were allowed to gain access. The war has entered its second summer and a year has passed since we first drove down this road, where men died in the first battles and where they die still. Shells land, but this is common place on the high-speed drive into Pesky, where the war never stops. It’s mostly the old and the sick who are left behind. We were staying with Svetlana, aged 68,and with her husband, who’s the same age. Anatoli is the beekeeper of Pesky, tending the hive of his neighbours who have fled. TRANSLATION: I’m taking care of them. They’re here. How can Ijust leave them? The food that they produce, they share with elderly neighbours. The shops are too distant, the route too dangerous. TRANSLATION: It’s terrifying, before I only had a few grey hairs here. Now, yOU CBFI Sââ... When I look at myself, with my glasses on, it’s terrifying. We’re really fed-up because they don’t let us go anywhere. There is no ceasefire here, and coming back to Pesky, I wondered why Anatoli and Svetlana refuse to leave. TRANSLATION: just take a look. If I go to a city, I will be under shelling as well. When I’m on my way there somebody could shoot me or steal my car, anything can happen. Anatoli did evacuate Svetlana to the city but, together since they were 16, separation was too hard. TRANSLATION: When he was alone here, every morning and evening we called each other. I had a strong pain in my soul, and so did he. He was a lonely man here because all the neighbours moved away. Can Ijust ask you, what does she mean to you? TRANSLATION: How can I explain what she means to me? She’s here. By night, soldiers shoot up at the drones that are scanning the ground for targets. Nearby, the Ukrainians launch shells at rebel positions. Anatoli and Svetlana have gone to bed, they’re asleep, because for them, this utterly abnormal situation that’s taking place all around them, this is normal now. Morning, and time to check on an older neighbour. Sonia, aged 77, is gathering fodder for her cow. She lives with her severely disabled son and says there’s nowhere else she can take him. TRANSLATION: Don’t be afraid. I will not give you away to anybody. Don’t be afraid, my little one. CRYING. Don’t be afraid, my baby. The politicians broke the country into pieces. This poor Ukraine, just broken into pieces. But there are strong bonds of love here. In war you meet all kinds of people, but you are some of the nicest people I’ve ever met, and certainly the bravest. ""Stay safe"", they replied. Anatoli and Svetlana, keeping alive the struggle of decent people. Fergal Keane, BBC News, Pesky. A heatwave affecting many parts of India has now claimed the lives of more than 1,000 people. The majority of deaths have been in the southern states with temperatures reaching 50 degrees Celsius in some areas. The high temperatures are expected to continue until the start of the summer monsoon at the end of the month. Cricket, and for the first time an Australian has been appointed to the role of England’s head coach. Trevor Bayliss willjoin next month, just in time to mastermind this summer’s Ashes series. He’s previously coached Sri Lanka and says he’s looking forward to working with ""a very talented group of players."" The State Opening of Parliament will take place tomorrow, 20 days after the general election, when the Queen will deliver a speech outlining the Conservative programme for the coming year. The speech will include a commitment to hold a referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union, to devolve more power from Westminster. Our deputy political editor looks at what might be in store. The streets are closed, the security tightened, the cavalry as rehearsed as the broadcasters. Tomorrow, Parliament will be opened by the Queen with full pomp and pageantry and we’ll find out which election promises the Government wants to implement quickly and those it’s happy to put on hold. My Lords and members of the House of Commons. The last time the Queen read out a list of purely Conservative measures was almost 20 years ago, whenjohn Major was in charge. Now, she’ll do the same from today’s Tory Government, unrestrained by coalition. That means that we can govern as a one-nation Government for all hard-working people, offering security and opportunity for everyone, at every stage of their lives. So the Queen’s Speech will echo much of the Tory manifesto. There’ll be measures to give more than a million Housing Association tenants the right-to-buy their homes at a discount and to give twice as much free childcare for parents of three and four-year-olds. There’ll be new laws to stop the Government raising national insurance, VAT and income tax rates and to give the police the power to seize the wages of illegal immigrants. What these Cabinet ministers know is they have only a small majority in the House of Commons to get these measures through, and while Labour may be distracted by a leadership contest, it remains the official opposition. There’ll be lots of language about fairness and working people, but actually it’s the detail that matters. Who’s going to be affected? Who’s going to be paying the price for those cuts, for those unfunded pledges? That’s ourjob, as a strong opposition, and we’ll be watching the small print very closely indeed. David Cameron will face perhaps his greatest battle over Britain’s place in the European Union, over the details of his planned referendum, such as what question voters will be asked. There’ll be opposition to his plans to break the formal link between the European Court of Human Rights, here in Strasbourg, with the courts in Britain, by scrapping the Human Rights Act. I’d be extremely wary, particularly under a Conservative Government, of withdrawing from the European Convention which we set up after the war. As for the Bill giving new powers for the Scottish Parliament over taxes and welfare, the SNP will push for more. We believe that greater power over business taxes, employment law, the minimum wage and welfare would enable us to better create jobs, grow the economy and lift people out of poverty. But perhaps the greatest opposition to this Queen’s Speech will come from in here, the House of Lords, where the Government has no majority and Labour and Lib Dem peers are already organising to take the battle to this Government. Today, Madame Tussaud’s unveiled its updated wax figure of David Cameron with more lines and grey hair. They might need even more in another five years. james Landale, BBC News, Westminster. Daniel Barenboim, one of the world’s most distinguished conductors and pianists, has unveiled a new type of grand piano which he says is ""radically different"" to the standard concert grand. It is built with straight, parallel strings which he says produces a superior sound. He launched the instrument at the Royal Festival Hall, on London’s South Bank, as our arts editor, Will Gompertz, reports. Daniel Barenboim, playing Beethoven’s Opus57 on his grand piano. It makes not one, in his opinion, that is quite as clear as this. The sound made by the new piano he has recently conceived. The variation between the two might appear marginal to the untrained ear, but for the maestro they are quite different in sound and feel. The contact with the key is with the tip of the finger. And the relationship between the tip of the finger and the key is different. It’s not a difference in weight, it’s because it speaks immediately and each note is more independent. It has more diversity. Why did you want to make a new piano? I played on one of List’s pianos in Italy, which had been completely redone in 2011. I was struck by the transparency and the independence of the notes in this piano. The most obvious difference is in the layout of the strings. A typical modern grand piano has a two-tier design with the strings crossing dieing a Natalie. Barenboim’s are arranged flat and straight. When he taught he said to one of his students, if you play a chord of four notes, each one must have a different sound. And that you can do on this piano. You can’t do on a regular Stein way. I don’t like to think about the things I can’t do. If Beethoven or Mozart were sitting here today which would they play, the new Barenboim or the old Steinway. Bring them here so I have a chance to talk to them. There are currently two Barenboims in the world. One was presented to the media today at the Royal Festival ",,

Two days and counting, the country enters the final push of the election campaign. Criss-crossing the UK in the race for votes, as questions focus on what constitutes a ‘legitimate’ government, if there’s a hung parliament. The party with the most wind in its sails seems to me has the right to reach... If they reach out to us, then of course we will talk to them in a grown-up way. He isjust then of course we will talk to them in a grown-up way. He is just as likely to support and Ed Miliband SNP government that would bring the country in my view to a jo Drinkhall than he is to support the Conservatives. Britain can do a lot better than this and has less than A8 hours to get rid of David Cameron and have a Labour government. We’ll be getting the latest from our correspondents on the campaign trail. Also this lunchtime, ten days after the earthquake, the 1 million children in need of help in Nepal. And still they come, the migrants rescued in the Mediterranean sea on a cargo ship, and they’re lucky ones.

In BBC London, tonnes of aid collected by the Nepalese community here but now they fear there is no way to deliver it to the people in need. And the street art transforming a posh part of London. Good afternoon, and welcome to the BBC News at One. Party leaders are on a two-day marathon tour of the UK, as the election campaign enters its final stages, and it’s going to be gruelling. Conservative leader David Cameron is beginning 36 hours of non-stop campaigning, Nick Clegg is launching a ""two-day dash"" from Land’s End tojohn 0’Groats, while Ed Miliband is targeting key seats in the south of England. In a moment, we’ll have reports from the other campaigns, but first Carole Walker reports from Hendon, where David Cameron insisted he would ""put the country first"", if he fails to secure a majority on Thursday, and said a government formed by a party that did not have the most seats would have a ""massive credibility problem"". First stop on David Cameron’s final drive for votes was a garden centre in south-west London, in the constituency of one of the Liberal Democrat ministers he is hoping to oust from power. It is great to be here in Twickenham this morning at the start of a 36 hour tour of the whole of our country. His core message was on the dangers of a Labour government, which would have to rely on the SNP. A Scottish member of the audience objected to his tone. We need to avoid that chaos, you need to listen to this, sir, it is important, if you don’t want chaos, you need to get out and vote Conservative. As he travels on today, tonight and tomorrow, Mr Cameron will remind voters of the upturn in the economy, and repeat his warnings that this would be put at risk by labour propped up by the SNP, even though Ed Miliband has rolled out a deal. -- SNP, even though Ed Miliband has rolled out a deal. -- ruled out. In north London, with Borisjohnson along to rally voters, some tough questions here too, with one woman suggesting people would be put off voting for a Conservative government when so many of its senior figures were at the same school. Yes, jump in, Boris! It is absolutely true, I can’t hide it, I can’t hide it, I did go to the same school as the party leader, there is no getting away from it. So, in the final phase of this campaign, David Cameron will be sticking to that core message of the choice at this election between what he says would be a stable government under his leadership or chaos under any of his rivals. The polls may be pointing to an uncertain outcome, but David Cameron insists he is still fighting to win outright and secure a second term in power. Ed Miliband has urged people to get out and vote in the election on Thursday, saying it’s ""going to be one of the closest in history"". He says the NHS is facing a ""financial time bomb"", and is urging people to vote Labour to prevent this happening. Our political correspondent Iain Watson is travelling with Mr Miliband, and sent this report from Bedford. With less than A8 hours to go until the polls open, Ed Miliband is travelling to marginal seats in England, which have been moving his way. Labour lost Bedford to the Conservatives in 2010. Local activists here say voters still have doubts about who to back, so he came here to talk to some of the undecided people in this audience about the health service, and warned that many hospitals in England are considering making cuts. Savage cuts on the way at two thirds of hospitals because of a cash crisis made in Downing Street. When the NHS is cut, it is working families who bear the brunt. That is why we will keep going right to the last minutes of the last hours of this campaign to rescue the National Health Service. You are warning that two thirds of hospital trusts in England are facing a deficit this year of up to £2 billion. It seems to me that would use up almost all of the two and a half billion pound offering for the NHS in England. Where will you the extra cash? By hiring more nurses, more doctors, you deal with the financial pressures faced. Ed Miliband is not looking for last-minute conversions from the Conservatives, he is talking about the NHS because it is one of voters top two concerns, but it is also a way of rallying troops, getting supporters out to the ballot box, and trying to ensure -- supporters out to the ballot box, and trying to ensure -- reassure some of the waverers in the audience. But moments later it was notjust voters who audience. But moments later it was not just voters who were wavering. Ed Miliband had his campaign pledges etched into stone this weekend to show how serious he was about delivering them, but in a BBC radio interview this morning one of his closest campaign advisers did not sound at all sure about what happened if he didn’t. I don’t think anyone thinks that he is absolutely not going to break them or anything like that... He is covering less ground than his main opponents, but for Ed Miliband, a message message -- matters more than the campaign miles. The Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg has begun a thousand-mile road trip from Lands End tojohn 0’Groats, pushing the message that only his party can offer stability. Kamal Ahmed reports. Cheers and an early start at Land’s End for Nick Clegg. There are not many voters out at 5am, but there are other party faithful. Mr Clegg told them this election was not a time for turning left to Labour or write to the Conservatives. It is 1000 miles I will apparently complete between now and john 0’Groats, crisscrossing the country, visiting lots of Liberal Democrats constituencies. I breakfast time, Mr Clegg was at jamie oliver’s restaurant in Newquay, as his journey continued, defending seats mainly against conservative challengers. Nick Clegg will certainly be seeing a lot of this bus over the next two days. He is travelling over 1000 miles before Wednesday evening. What he has suggested is that he will be willing to open negotiations with whatever party has the most votes and the most seats on May the 8th. Bouncing along on the bus, Mr Clegg said he was open to offers from the party that does best on Thursday, as long as they agreed to the Lib Dem red lines on increased education and health spending. The party with the most wind in its sales, it seems to me, has the right to reach out... If they reach out to us, of course we will reach out and have a grown-up, social, as long as they know what our red lines are. Try and smile! To Lib Dem target on Thursday? To win more than 30 seats and play a role as kingmakers in the next government. Our assistant political Editor Norman smith is in Westminster. So they are racking up the air miles and sticking to the airwaves, as well. I don’t know if you remember Billy whizz from the Beano, but it seems to me we have reached a Billy whizz moment with the party leaders whizzing all over in a final frantic frenzy of activity to try and shore UP frenzy of activity to try and shore up their vote, and anything could happen in these last 1+8 hours or so. We saw David Cameron being heckled for the first time, I think, and we saw Labour’s election coordinator, Lucy Powell, a bit of a gaffe, when asked about Ed Miliband’s headstone and those promises, whether he would keep them, not sure that he would. It seems for me that for all of the rushing about, though, it is not really going to change, and although the leaders will be on motorways going hither and thither, this election is a bit more like being stuck on the M25 frankly. We have been on it for an awfully long time. We are not really going anywhere, but at the head is a turn-off marked election day, and I suspect most of us would be very glad to get there. If that turn off says hung parliament, there are questions about the legitimacy of what sort of government follows that. It does seem very likely now that we are heading towards a hung parliament. We have the latest poll out today, suggesting that the two main parties, after weeks, months of campaigning, still neck and neck, tied on 31+% each, which means this is hung parliament country. The question then arises, if it is still so tight, who will govern? Will it be the party with the most numbers of seats, or will it be the party that with the support of others can put together a majority to command the Commons? In other words, does it come down to political legitimacy or does it come down to Parliamentary arithmetic? And that is where a tension -- arithmetic? And that is where a tension -- attention is beginning to turn, even though what we will hear from politicians in the last 1+8 hours is about how they are campaigning for every last vote, their attention is beginning to turn to the crucial question about what matters: The maths or the mood music and political legitimacy. Ukip’s leader Nigel Farage is campaigning in Sandwich today, and the Ukip leader is urging people to ""vote with their heart"", as no party would win an outright majority. Mr Farage said Ukip offered ""strong voices"" that would ""stand up to the political establishment"". But former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said a vote for Ukip would be like a ""suicide note"". We’ll have more on the election later on in the programme and you can keep up to date with all the election coverage at the BBC Election Live web page, that’s at bbc.co.uk/electionlive. After the devastating earthquake ten days ago, aid agencies working in Nepal say that more than a million children have been affected. In Kathmandu, one of the most well- known private orphanages has been damaged, and more than 100 children have had to move to temporary shelters. Our correspondent, Yogita Limaye, is there. Here in Kathmandu at one of the most well-known orphanages, there were more than 100 children, 120 children, who lived inside there. They have now, in a sense, lost the only home they have ever had, because a part of that building has collapsed, they have had to move to temporary shelters, and I visited them earlier. Ten months ago, this baby girl was found at a Kathmandu hospital. Wrapped in plastic and left in a dustbin. Karina isjust a month older, and she too was abandoned in the city. These babies were rescued by a private orphanage, but they have now, once again, lost their home. Miraculously, all of the 120 children survived. But a part of the building that housed their orphanage collapsed. For this boy, it was home for six years. TRANSLATION: I was having a bath when everything started to shake. I said God’s name, then I ran out. I really miss our home. This temporary shelter has been set up at a government office. The children have had to be crammed into the small rooms available. A far cry from their home. This is where the children used to live. It is actually a grand old Palace, and this section was given to the orphanage. And you can see that it is exactly that part which has fallen off. Stuffed toys and books have been left behind, scattered on the shelf. It is the only familiar place most of the children ever knew. They lost everything, they don’t know anywhere except this house, because they are orphans. They don’t have a family. And they know their home is abandoned and this house is completely lost. Therefore, I think some of these children are facing psychosocial problems also. With so many thousands dead from the earthquake, and whole villages destroyed, even more children now will perhaps be deprived of a normal childhood. The children from the orphanage, at least there is a temporary shelter there, many in far-flung areas of the country, there is a shortage of tents, they are out in the open, and thatis tents, they are out in the open, and that is what aid agencies are worried about, about the outbreak of disease. We know that several organisations have started vaccination camps for diseases like measles, monitoring very closely for waterborne diseases like diarrhoea and dissension. Thank you very much. It is coming up at a quarter past one, the top story, two days and counting, the country enters the final push of the election campaign, as the leaders crisscross the UK in the race the votes. Still to come, on screen again, as the birthplace of British scenario bonded stores. Coming up in sport at our past, he started the tournament as a 50-1 outsider, now he is world champion. Stuart Bingham beats Shaun Murphy in a thrilling final at the Crucible. Around 1+0 migrants have drowned trying to cross the Mediterranean from North Africa according to the charity Save the Children. At least 1,800 migrants have died this year trying to cross the Mediterranean to reach Europe, a 20-fold increase on the same period last year. Almost 60,000 migrants have made it to Europe by boat. Since Friday, more than 7,000 people have been rescued. Our correspondent james Reynolds has been to the port of Catania in Sicily where he’s been talking to one family about theirjourney. These migrants were rescued by this huge blue and white container ship and this ship has brought them here to the Sicilian port of Catania. And they’re part of this recent surge of migrants. Traffickers have taken advantage of the good spring weather to launch many, many migrant boats, overcrowded and now picked up by merchant ships and the Italian Coastguard. Not everybody survived this trip. We watched Italian officials bring down coffins from this boat. We don’t know exactly how those people died. The Italian officials have also been looking after the living. just over there, some migrants have been given new shoes and socks and they now wait to find out what kind of new life they will get here in Sicily. I managed to talk to some of those who made this trip. Where did you come from? I am from Nigeria. What was the trip like? The trip was... Some of us survive. But not everyone survived? Not everyone. How many people died? Maybe 1+2 people died on the boat. Who did you come with on your trip? I came with my family. How were the children able to cope with the trip? Was it easy, was it very difficult? It’s not easy at all. It’s very difficult. What do you feel, now that you are in Europe, you are safe, how do you feel now? Well, we feel so good. We feel great because now we are safe. So we feel great. What will you do now? Now actually. .. All we need now is your help to - I need to find out to assist my family so that they’ll be moving forward. When you say your help you mean the help of Europe? Yes, the help of Europe. You know that it’s quite controversial in Europe because there are some people who say too many migrants are coming, what do you say to that? What I will say to that is... I don’t really get it. That report was from james Reynolds in Catania. A former IRA commander has been shot dead in South Belfast. Gerard ""jock"" Davison was killed outside his home in the Markets neighbourhood, a Catholic district well- known as a stronghold for the IRA. It’s not clear if the murder is linked to tensions within the Republican community. Chris Buckler is in Belfast for us. He was a senior figure within the IRA. Yes, indeed, as you mentioned he was a prominent figure and a well-known individual in the Markets area of Belfast which is about a mile away from here. He had also been implicated in some way in the wider controversy surrounding the killing of a man more than a decade ago. That was the killing of Robert McCartney who was allegedly stabbed by members of the IRA and it was also claimed the organisation had forensically cleaned the bar afterwards. It was also believed at that time that the IRA had tried to cover up the murder in some way. Now his uncle was later tried but acquitted of the murder. There is still controversy surrounding it. It has to be said that a number of Gerard Davison’s family and friends were at the scene, they were deeply upset, there were children crossing the road screaming, daddy, daddy. Thank you very much. Researchers say a new screening technique could dramatically improve the diagnosis of ovarian cancer. A 11+-year trial, involving nearly 50,000 women, suggests that the test is twice as effective as current ways of detecting the disease and could lead to a national screening programme. Our health correspondent Adam Brimelow reports. It took more than 12 months to get a diagnosis. By then, the disease had spread. Now after seven sessions of chemotherapy and major surgery, she’s in remission. I think with an earlier diagnosis maybe it could have prevented me having to go through all the gruelling chemo, the massive operation which was seven hours in total, and I think that would have perhaps prevented all that. Every year, ovarian cancer kills more than 1+,000 women in the UK. Survival is much better if it’s picked up early. When they suspect cancer, clinicians check for raised levels of a protein in the blood. But it doesn’t give a reliable diagnosis. So rather than focussing on a fixed level to indicate risk, researchers have tracked changes in the protein levels. They followed nearly 50,000 women in this way, year after year, for more than a decade. In that time, they picked up nearly nine out of ten cancer cases, many more than if they worked with the fixed cut-off level. They say findings are encouraging but they remain cautious. To find out whether it makes a difference we need to see whether we have picked up these women early enough such that treatment has saved their lives. Those results are expected later this year but health campaigners have welcomed the latest findings. Ovarian cancer can be difficult to diagnose in the early stage and symptoms can be symptoms of lots of other things that aren’t cancer and it can be hard to pick it up at a stage when treatment is likely to be successful so a test that helps this pick it up early is a really exciting possibility. If further trial results are successful, a national screening programme could follow, potentially improving prospects for all who develop ovarian cancer. HSBC says it will make its decision on whether to move its headquarters out of the UK within months rather than years. The bank has been based here since 1993 when it moved to the UK to enable it to take over high street giant Midland Bank. Let’s talk to our correspondent. Who are the preliminary Kay -- implications of this? They’re moving swiftly. Most likely destination Hong Kong, where they already have a huge operation. As far as the implications are concerned, today they’ve been talking down the impact on jobs. they’ve been talking down the impact onjobs. HSBC employs they’ve been talking down the impact on jobs. HSBC employs 1+8,000 people in the UK but rather than thousands moving, because most of those are involved in the UK operation, it would be 250 headquartersjobs involved in the UK operation, it would be 250 headquarters jobs which would go to another country. Still that would be a big loss to the City of London, one of the biggest banks in the world decided to up sticks elsewhere. Why are they doing it? The Government’s bank levc is costing £700 million a year. Pay is another consideration, because the European Union is stricter now on paying bonuses and that affects what they can pay elsewhere in the world. It’s notjust that move. There’s been speculation about HSBC selling its UK high street bank, perhaps renaming it, giving it back its old name of Midland Bank and the reason for that is that UK banks are having to ringfence their high street operations from riskier commercial operations to protect them from a financial crisis in the future. But they said today they didn’t want to lose too much control. They were uncomfortable with that prospect. So the possibility of selling - the decision could take years. Thank you very much. The state of the NHS in England has been a major talking point during the campaign, health in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is run by devolved administrations with their own elections next year. A new study suggests that the NHS has fewer doctors, nurses and hospital beds than health services in many other wealthy nations and a key part of the debate has been how to ease the increasing strain on GP practices. Our health editor Hugh Pym reports. Some polls say it’s the biggest issue for voters in this election campaign. The parties are making promises over more staff and investment but what’s the message from the front line of the NHS? GPs like Dr Paul Cundy believe politicians aren’t facing up to the intense pressures on the health service, keeping up with the needs of patients means the workload is increasing. In this surgery we have patients, we have double-figure number of patients who have survived three cancers and patients often survive C3I’1CâI’S HOW. They survive the first, the second and they’re being treated for the third. During that time they then develop other conditions like diabetes, blood pressure. They have arthritis. Conditions of frailty. If you completely discount everything else we simply have a burgeoning workload. The number of GPs in England in 2010 stood at over 35,000. By 2013 it had only gone up slightly to around 35,500. But the population is rising and there’s been a 21+% increase in GP consultations since 1998. Recruitment of GPs is a problem. This practice in Rotherham has struggled to fill vacancies for the last year. Some political parties have promised to fund the creation of thousands of new posts in general practice by 2020, but doctors here are highly doubtful about whether that can be achieved. It will take decades, not years, to get that kind of number of GPs. We need to really look at graduate level, medical schools to try to focus more general practice education and getting them through the system to want to be GPs, not push somebody to become a GP but give them the interest to become GPs and that will take decades. There is no solution that will be sorted out in terms of workforce for five years. All of this can mean frustration for patients getting GP appointments and that can cause pressures on other parts of the system, including A&E. Whoever forms the next Government there is a general acceptance across the NHS that there needs to be radical new thinking to cope with the complex health needs of an increasing population, with community health teams, GPs and hospitals working more closely together. More money is also an issue and as the parties debate how much is needed, the message from GPs is that difficult decisions will have to be made soon, if they’re to continue providing the care which their patients expect. Hugh is here now. Whoever takes charge it’s a difficult prescription. Indeed. We have had a lot of talk from parties about what they would do the NHS, how much they would spend but there is an interesting report and observation today on how the NHS in the UK across the whole of the UK, notjust England, compares with other leading healthcare systems. It looked at members of the OECD, a wealthier group of nations, 30 of them, to see where the UK is in terms of health. It has the NHS really in the middle of the table in terms of spending per head on health. And quite low down for the number of doctors and nurses per head and low down in terms of the numbers of hospital beds per person in the population. They’re saying there is a need for more money, the parties are right, but they point out that the NHS is pretty cost-efficient in terms of what is spent, the outcomes are efficient, pretty reasonable. They’re efficient, pretty reasonable. They’re also saying the NHS is very fair when it comes to access to health for all income groups across the population. Thank you very much. Throughout the campaign, we’ve heard all the policy pledges, and we’ve seen the manifestos. After nearly five weeks of campaigning you’d perhaps be forgiven for forgetting some of the main points. So, in case you need a reminder, Christian Fraser has been taking a final look over in the campaign hub. There has been a fair bit of campaigning since the manifestos were published three weeks ago. But since we are on the cusp of the vote let’s remind ours selves about the commitments made. Starting with the economy and the comfort who are planning to eliminate the deficit by the third year of this parliament, running a surplus by 2018-19. The Labour Party, less austerity but perhaps longer, balancing the books by cutting the deficit every year with a surplus by some point at the end of parliament. The Liberal Democrats with their former coalition partners getting rid of the deficit by 2017-18, so too Ukip, ensuring that the Treasury sticks to its promises. It’s really only the SNP that is the party here of anti--austerity, talking about modest spending increase that is would amount to £11+0 billion of extra investment over the course of the next five years. What about health? It’s always up there at the top of the policy pops. The Conservatives, strangely, promising more than Labour, £8 billion above inflation over the next five years to meet the spending 9aP next five years to meet the spending gap that the NHS itself has identified. Labour, talking about £2. 5 billion of extra fundings but they would say that is fully costed and the Conservative plan is not. The Liberal Democrats, again on the same platform as the Conservatives, £8 billion by 2020. Ukip going a little further, £3 billion over five years, £15 billion in all by pulling out of the European Union and the SNP really taking £21+ billion by 2020-21. Immigration, one of the big issues. The Conservatives would stop migrants claiming benefits in work and out of work benefits until they’ve been here four years. Labour thinks the factor are wages, they’ll make it illegal for employers to undercut British workers. The Liberal Democrats want to restore full entry and exit border checks. Ukip have an Australian-style points system. And perhaps a 50,000 cap. The SNP talking about a more sensible immigration policy, that would mean seeking the reintroduction of the post-study work visa which they say is important to Scotland. What’s this going to cost? A lot of people interested in tax. The Conservatives would lift those on the minimum wage out of tax altogether. And the threshold for the 1+op rate would go UP threshold for the 1+op rate would go up to £50,000. Labour would introduce a top rate for those earning over £150,000. The Liberal Democrats would also raise the income tax threshold for the lowest paid. Ukip, the same. But they go further on £13,500 and the SNP would restore that 50p top rate of tax and also much heavier taxes for the highest paid. Remember there’s a highest paid. Rememberthere’s a lot Remember there’s a lot more of this on our website. Also the policies of Plaid Cymru in Wales and the Green Party. Thank you very much. You’re watching the BBC News at One. Two days and counting, the country enters the final push of the election campaign, as the leaders criss-cross the UK in the race for votes. In a moment, we’ll have a full weather forecast, plus the news where you are. But first, here’s the sport, with Katie Gornall. Snooker has a new world champion. Stuart Bingham started the tournament as a 50-1 outsider, but defied the odds to beat Shaun Murphy in the final at the Crucible. He’s the oldest first-time winner for more than 70 years. Ben Croucher has the story. The moment Stuart Bingham’s life changed forever. 20 years after turning pro, at a venue where he had only once past the second round. Now he was world champion. 20 years as a pro, blood, sweat and tears, on the road, qualifying, everything rolled into one. So many family and friends have been backing me and behind me, it hasjust been have been backing me and behind me, it has just been on the Liverpool. Trailing 9-8 entering the final two sessions, that belief would have risen as he nearly made it 11+7 in the process, only to break down on the final red. The 2005 champion, Murphy, playing in his third final, would not back down. He clawed his way back to 15-15, as the Crucible readied itself for a long night. Long summed up the 31st frame, Stuart Bingham even needed a toilet break in the middle. He returned to clinch the frame, and came back, a near nervous display from the man from Basildon. He is now world number two, from Basildon. He is now world numbertwo, and £300,000 from Basildon. He is now world number two, and £300,000 richer. just don’t tell the wife. England are looking for another new opener, afterjonathan Trott announced his retirement from international cricket. He was recalled for the tour of West Indies, 18 months after leaving the Ashes tour with a stress-related problem. But he found runs hard to come by in the Caribbean, as Nick Parrott reports. Three ducks, and just 72 runs in the West Indies, was enough forjonathan Trott to bring his England comeback to an end. He felt his game was not at the required level, saying I was honoured to be given the chance to return, and I’m disappointed it didn’t work out. This is a man with an outstanding record, he has played brilliantly for England. A chance for him to get back into the team with his quality and experience and skill with what is coming up was a great opportunity. So we have had a look, he has had a go, it has been a tough trip for him, so he will be disappointed, but the opportunity to get that chance, he earned through his performance. England have struggled to find a reliable opening batsmen since Andrew Strauss retired three years ago. It looks like Andrew Strauss will take over as director of cricket, but we don’t know the job description or what it entails. What ever it is, Strauss will do a greatjob, she is a wonderful natural leader of men, and he has a great record as a leader of England cricket. Kevin Pietersen is trying to prove he is worth a recall, but he fell out with Strauss, and is unlikely to return, despite many admirers, including England’s next opponents. I have played with Kevin Connolly is a very strong competitor and a world-class player. Any team with Kevin Pietersen in it will be a very tough opposition. England have a fortnight to sort themselves out before two tests against New Zealand, in preparation for Australia in the Ashes Series this summer. Plenty for the England hierarchy to think about. That’s all the sport for now. Back to you. It’s been tucked away off one of London’s busiest shopping streets for years, with hardly anyone knowing its importance. It was the birthplace of British cinema, and now, 120 years after the UK’s first public screening of a moving picture, the Regent Street Cinema is re-opening its doors, following a multi-million pound restoration project. Graham Satchell has been to find out more. It was here on Regent Street in 1896 that history was made. The Lumiere brothers came over from France with their cinematograph and within this building people saw for the first time moving pictures. It is why this is known as the birthplace of British cinema. This is what the first audience saw. It was shocking. Some people in the theatre screamed, worried the train would hit them. Simon’s grandmother was at the screening and wrote about it in a letter to her father. Aunty took us to the Polytechnik to see the photographs that move, you know, like real life. It was delightful. I think it caused some fright, actually, particularly the train coming to the station. Audiences were terrified and thought they were going to be run into. The theatre on Regent Street was known for its innovation. In the 181+os, it held dramatic public scientific experiments. Then some of the first Magic Lantern shows. It was the natural choice for the Lumiere brothers to show their photographs that move like real life. This is the birthplace of British cinema. I think you can feel the magic in this space. You walk into it and you just think about the wonderful, momentous events that have happened here. Westminster University has now spent £6 million to bring the cinema back to life. When it reopens tomorrow, it will show new films, student films and some of the very first films, like this, shot by the Lumiere brothers 120 years ago. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Nina Ridge. After a very dry April, the rain we have had over the last 21+ hours has been quite welcome for some. Still some heavy rain through this afternoon, but a real feature will be those strong winds persisting into tomorrow, as a result making it feel quite cool. This was the rain moving across England and Wales tonight, still with us through Scotland and Northern Ireland, here the pressure will sit throughout the next couple of hours. To the south of that, there are some brighter skies, but a few showers mixed in as well. A more detailed look at what we can expect around 1+pm today, wet and windy conditions across much of England, -- Scotland, with that north easterly breeze. For Northern Ireland, a slow improvement, perhaps brightening up a touch to the south. Not too many showers expected across parts of eastern England this afternoon. The main focus of some pretty lively heavy showers could be towards South West England and Wales, accompanied by these very strong winds, touching gale force at times, gusting to around 50 or 60 mph full stop they will blow those showers through, and as we move our way northwards, we might see a few crossing the Pennines into the north-east of England. But those strong, gale force winds will stay across the UK overnight tonight. Still keeping some of that rain to the West, a mixture of clear spells but also some showers, so not especially cold. Loads of six to 9 degrees. Our low is still with us on Wednesday, keeping that feed of strong winds swirling around. Some rain to the north and west, bands of showers moving their way through pretty quickly, but there could be some heavy down showers, and in between, windows of dry and brighter conditions. Temperatures a little bit disappointing. When you add on the strong wind, it will be another cool day on Thursday. Our low pressure is steadily moving north-eastwards, heading off to Scandinavia on Thursday, allowing the isobars to open up. Thursday, lighter winds come especially to the south, stilla lighter winds come especially to the south, still a few showers to the North. Thing is starting to quieten down on Thursday with some bright and sunny spells, so it should feel a little warmer. Still temperatures struggling for Scotland and Northern Ireland at around nine to 10th stop Friday starts dry, but an approaching system to the south-west thatis approaching system to the south-west that is likely to bring some rain, and it looks like we will have a fairly wet start to the weekend.

Two days and counting, the country enters the final push of the election campaign, as the leaders criss-cross the UK That is all from us, on BBC One, time for the news where you are. Good afternoon. Clear Good afternoon, I’m Asad Ahmad. A former teacher at one of the country’s leading private schools in south west London has pleaded guilty to possessing and making thousands of indecent images of children. Anthony Fuggle was a Classics master at Colet Court, the junior section of St Paul’s Prep School in Barnes. He’s the first person to be charged under the Met’s ""Operation Winthorpe"", which was set up to investigate allegations of abuse at the school. He’ll be sentenced next month. A murder investigation has begun inside Wandsworth Prison, after an inmate was found dead in his cell. Police were called to the prison when the man’s body was discovered last week. Another prisoner has been arrested. Wandsworth prison is the largest in Britain and can hold more than 1,800 inmates. The first ever ""enforcement"" notice ordering a building to be rebuilt, brick by brick, could be issued today. Last month, the Israeli owners of a historic pub in Maida Vale, demolished it without permission. It’s understood, the owners of the Carlton Tavern wanted to build flats on the site instead, but hadn’t got permission. Westminster Council said it was ""horrified"" at the destruction. London’s Royal College of Art has been named as the world’s leading University of Art and design, according to the latest rankings. The college, which has recently opened new facilities in Battersea, beat a number of prestigious American art schools to the top spot. One of central London’s most expensive areas, which includes the Dominion Theatre and Fitzroy Square, is becoming a canvas for spray painting. It’s not down to mindless graffiti. This is down to art, as Katharine Carpenter has been finding out. They have been popping up across Fitz Rubio, portraits of local people spray-painted on to traffic light control boxes. We wanted to capture what is fit through the right now. This is Nelly. 89 years old and goes to the all souls clubhouse -- Fitzrovia. She was wonderful, and really let up when we photographed her.

We assess whether the Mayor has been the Tories’ so-called secret weapon. And the new blood test which could dramatically improve the diagnosis of ovarian cancer. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. The three main Westminster leaders have been criss-crossing the UK in a frenetic final two days of campaigning. David Cameron warned again against an SNP-backed Labour government. Nick Clegg suggested the UK could face a second election before Christmas if the Lib Dems are not included in a coalition. And Ed Miliband said he believed Labour would not borrow more than the Conservatives. But he was forced on the defensive after the vice chair of his campaign suggested thatjust because Mr Miliband has carved his election pledges in stone, it didn’t mean that he wouldn’t break them. Mr Miliband has speaking to our Deputy Political Editorjames Landale. He could be just hours from climbing to the highest office in the land. On the way, a has-been ridiculed and written off, but today Ed Miliband told me he was convinced that he was heading for Downing Street. No, I am ready to change this country for working people. And I see it as my duty to change this country for working people, because I believe that if David Cameron got back into power, you would wreck this country for working people, and I will not let his wrecking crew get back and wrecked the chances for working families. But why was his confidence not matched by voters who still question his ability to run the economy? There is a big choice at this election. Do you believe that the way a country succeeds is with the wealth trickling down from the few at the top, or do you believe a country succeeds by putting working people first? That is the big choice. Have you ever made a profit? Have you ever worked in an organisation that makes a profit? Do you understand what it means? You can understand what it means without having been a business person. I have not run a business. Do you have friends who run businesses? Of course, but what I know from them is what they want is a Government that will work with them. The problem is that some voters think that you look at a business or an organisation that makes a profit, and your first instinct is to tax it, regulate it, control it. No, my first instinct is to work with those businesses so they succeeded. Let me give an example. I took an the big six energy companies in the interests of millions of businesses and families who were not getting a fair deal. Many working people out there have the suspicion, and this is why they cannot bring themselves to vote for you, that you do not understand the commercial working lives, where profit is something that secures jobs. Profit is something that brings investment. They think you do not understand that. That is not right. I am clear that the future of this country will depend on millions more successful businesses. He says Labour would eliminate the deficit in day-to-day spending as soon as possible and get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of the parliament. But... Would you borrow a lot more than the Conservatives plan to? No, I don’t believe that. An aunt, the Institute for Fiscal Studies says that debt will be about 90 billion more in 2019 if Labour’s plans were implemented that if the Conservatives’ plans were implemented. I don’t agree. Because he said the Tories have failed to deliver on their deficit cuts and would do so again. Would you borrow a lot more than the Conservatives plan to, yes or no? No, I don’t believe we would. The credibility of a deficit plan is, does it add up? Does it make sense? And will it work? And will Labour actually win a majority? Today for the first time, money Mr Miliband acknowledged that he may have to work with other parties, revealing a symbolic policy that would not be up for negotiation, whatever Government he leads. Non-dom status. Any Government I lead will get rid of non-dom status. I want one rule for all in our country. That is the kind of thing my Government will do. Non-doms are non-negotiable? Absolutely. And lots of things. His decision to get his policy promises carved in stone ready for the Downing Street garden, has prompted much derision, both are today one of his campaign chiefs got in a muddle and appeared to question their permanence. No one is suggesting that the fact that he has carved them in stone means that he will not break them. So you might bridge or promises, even though they are carved in stone? Not at all. Carved in stone, to live by a Labour government. For Ed Miliband, it has been a long campaign and quite a personaljourney am one that even now is not short of surprises. Hell, yes! In a matter of hours, we and he will find out if the country has that ""hell, yes"" or ""hell, no"". Well, the other party leaders are on their final push for votes. David Cameron’s said he’ll be campaigning into the early hours, while Nick Clegg is on a thousand mile tour of the UK from Land’s End tojohn 0’Groats. In a moment, Gavin Hewitt with the Conservatives, but first, Kamal Ahmed has been travelling with the Liberal Democrats. Cheers and a brutally early start at Land’s End for Nick Clegg. There are not many voters out at 5am, but there are the party faithful. It is an epicjourney, starting at Land’s End. I will complete 1000 an epicjourney, starting at Land’s End. Iwill complete 1000 miles between here and john 0’Groats, Chris causing the country, visiting lots of Liberal Democrat constituencies. Why breakfast time, Mr Clegg was at jamie oliver’s restaurant in Newquay. By lunchtime, he was in Cardiff with his wife, telling voters that without the Liberal Democrats in coalition, there could be another election by, hold your breath, Christmas. The reason - hold your breath, Christmas. The reason - this election creates an unstable minority Government led by Labour or the Conservatives. They have given up being honest that they will not win an outright majority. Both of them will have an interest in going to the country all over again and having a second election before Christmas. Nick Clegg will certainly be seeing a lot of this bus over the next two days. He is travelling over 1000 miles before Wednesday evening. What he has suggested is that he will be willing to open negotiations with whichever party has the most votes and the most seats on May the 8th. Mr Clegg said he was open to offers from the party that does best on Thursday, as long as they agree to the Lib Dem redlines an increased education and health spending. The party with the most wind in its sails has the right to outlaws. They know our redlines. The Lib Dem tag on Thursdays to win more than 30 seats and play a role as kingmakers in the next Government. 36 hours to go! The final 36 hour push. Raw, rollicking. Even hacking. SNP! Then on to Hendon, a call centre in a London marginal. Intel, Borisjohnson as call centre in a London marginal. Intel, Boris johnson as warm-up, with his roll call of achievements. The technology capital of the world. And the questions about their schooling decidedly untamed. This prime minister, mayor chancellor were prime minister, mayor chancellor were in the same class at school. And for politicians, an plate. I did go to the same school as the party leader, no getting away from it. Then to the West Country, and for the Tories, must win marginals. In these final campaign stops, David Cameron is trying to get the voters to focus on two questions - Cameron is trying to get the voters to focus on two questions - who do they trust to run the economy, who do they trust to be Prime Minister? At every stop, he reminds the audience of Labour’s legacy. Ifeel like a Fahrmann. Ifeel like audience of Labour’s legacy. Ifeel like a Fahrmann. I feel like the firefighter hosing down the burning building, there is Ed Miliband, the arsonist, the guy that lit the building in the first place. That is why we need another five years, to make your more people are in work, but the likelihood is, lower taxes, more homes. This is notjust about winning outright, it is a push for legitimacy to win the seats, like hey in the south-west, so important in earning the first chance to form the next Government, post-election. A quest for every final voter. Having Stuart, BBC News, Cornwall. -- Gavin Hewitt. More of the day’s election news now. The SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, has been campaigning in West Lothian today at a nursery. She told journalists that if Scotland voted for a large number of SNP MPs, the country would be saying it wants its voice to be heard loud and clear in Westminster. Natalie Bennett, the leader of the Green Party, urged voters to ""send a message"" on climate change. She says her party is hoping to have an influence in the event of a hung parliament. Ukip’s leader Nigel Farage is campaigning in Kent. He’s urged people to ""vote with their heart"", as no party would win an outright majority. Mr Farage said Ukip offered ""strong voices"", and its campaign was having an impact with voters. I think we are holding up remarkably well under onslaught from everybody. Lots of ridiculous things are being said. ""Please don’t vote Ukip or the sky will fall in"", and all this sort of nonsense. Actually, our supporters believe in what we’re trying to do. We’re re-engaging people who haven’t voted for many, many years. Yeah, I’m excited about it still. Let’s talk to our political correspondent, jon Pienaar, at Westminster. All the leaders are trying to get their key messages across in the final days of campaigning. What is your assessment of what Ed Miliband had to say about Labour’s borrowing plans? Like all the leaders, they are hitting their core messages, addressing the doubts that may exist among many voters. For Ed Miliband, thatis among many voters. For Ed Miliband, that is about the economy. Labour have said before that they would not add to the mountainous burden of borrowing the country faces now. Now he says he does not believe Labour would borrow more than the Tories. He says that is on the basis that the Tories would overshoot their planned figures for borrowing. The assertion is without facts and figures to back it up. It is an unprovable suggestion, because if he is prime minister, we will never know what the Tories would do. The risk is that it may settle doubts, but for some, it will increase doubts about Labour’s had ability. As for the wider race, many are now looking at the Friday morning after. If no party wins the election outright, you could be into an argument about notjust outright, you could be into an argument about not just who has outright, you could be into an argument about notjust who has won the election, but who can win votes in the House of Commons. It can all sound like an episode of Game Of Thrones, without the naughty bits. And now the Liberal Democrats are saying we may have another election by Christmas. We don’t know, but this election day may turn out to be just half-time in the game to see who runs this country. A BBC investigation has found that mental health trusts in England are expecting significant funding cuts over the next four years. Financial forecasts for three-quarters of trusts show they’re predicting a reduction in income of almost 8% between 2014 and 2019. Experts say that despite commitments by central government to treat mental health equally with physical health, it’s not provided any more money. Our Health Correspondent, Sophie Hutchinson, has this exclusive report. Steve Martin is still living with the pain of his brother’s death. David had severe schizophrenia for more than 30 years, but last September, he was found in a coma in his flat and died. We had been through a lot together, being his next of kin. These pictures show the squalor which had become his home, with no hot water or heating. The mental health services that cared for David are in serious financial trouble, and have been strongly criticised for cutting back on the care they provided. Steve is convinced that his brother was neglected. I’m angry that they did not do the things that were so blimming obvious to anybody to do. I am angry that theyjust left him in cat poo and squalor in order to die on his own. I am angry that they did not get in touch with me to say they were making these changes. I’m angry I did not know the cuts had occurred and he was at risk like this. I am angry that I did not spend more time with him. NHS care for people with mental health problems in England is under increasing strain. Five-year plans seen by the BBC predict a significant fall in funding. Three quarters of trust forecast a real terms drop in income of ÂlI70 million. It comes at a time when demand for services is expected to increase in 2030 by an extra 2 million adults. For people with very severe mental health problems, we are seeing them struggling to access services, having to travel more for services, and the quality of the service and the intensity of the support they are receiving has declined. And with further funding cuts, it’s difficult to see how that trend would not continue. Over the past few years, politicians have repeatedly promised to put mental health services on a par with physical health, so why hasn’t it happened? Ministers say it’s because of long-standing problems in the system. If someone is suffering from suspected cancer, they have a right to see a specialist within two weeks of referral from their GP. If you’re suffering from a mental health problem, you have no such right. That cannot be right. It’s a discrimination at the heart of the NHS. NHS England has rejected the figures and stressed that they do not take into account the full range of services. Steve Martin has now fought successfully to have an inquest into his brother’s death. He is determined that lessons are learned. It’s just so angry making, because it was so avoidable. There’s lots of options that they had to do other things, theyjust didn’t do it. Yeah. You really feel that they have hugely let him down? Absolutely. Sophie Hutchinson, BBC News. The time isjust gone 6.15pm. Our top story this evening. Later on BBC London: Feeling the squeeze - a warning that London’s waterways are struggling to cope with the rise in the number of houseboats. And the changing image of Fitzrovia why traffic light boxes in Central London are being given a face lift. Coming up on Reporting Scotland at 6.30pm: A Scottish film maker, caught up in the Nepal earthquake, has finally returned home safely. And, he’s probably Scotland’s most famous rescue dog, now Kai is backing a campaign to find a home for hundreds of animals. Now, after weeks of pledges and polls, decision time is almost upon us. Millions of voters are taking a hard look at their options - the candidates, the leaders and of course the policies. Our chief political correspondent, Vicky Young, has this assessment of some of the key issues and where the parties stand. There’s a lot on offer from politicians at election time as they outline a blizzard of promises to tempt voters their way, from health and education to Europe and the economy. Arguments about the economy have focussed on reducing the deficit, that’s the difference between what the Government spends and what it gets in through taxes. The Conservatives plan to cut billions from welfare and Government departments in order to balance the books within two years and then run a surplus to start paying off the debt. They’ve promised tax cuts, but haven’t said how they’ll pay for all of them. The Labour Party say they’d cut the deficit every year and get rid of it by 2020 at the latest. They want higher taxes on the wealthy and they’d continue to borrow to pay for major projects like road building. The Liberal Democrats are offering to balance the budget with a mixture of cuts and taxes on higher earners. They, like the Tories, also want to increase how much we can earn before paying tax. In contrast, the SNP are calling for a modest spending increase to allow for extra investment. The Green Party and Plaid Cymru are also calling for an end to austerity. So what about health, a devolved issue? The Head of NHS England says that an extra £8 billion a year will be required by 2020 and big savings will need to be found. Labour are promising an extra £2.5 billion a year to pay for more nurses, midwives and GPs. Paid for by a mansion tax, a levy on tobacco companies and a clampdown on tax avoidance. The Conservatives have promised to find that £8 billion, but haven’t said how. They want patients to have seven-day access to GPs. The Liberal Democrats say they’d also increase NHS funding by £8 billion and extra resources would go to mental health. Now, let’s take a look at Europe and Britain’s membership of the European Union. Here there are real differences between the parties. Leaving the EU is Ukip’s number one policy, they argue it’s the only way for the UK to reduce immigration and, they say, it would save billions which can be spent on the NHS and tax cuts. The Conservatives have vowed to hold an in-out referendum on EU membership by 2017, after a renegotiation with European partners. By contrast, the Liberal Democrats are arguing to stay in the EU and they agree with Labour, who are against a referendum unless new powers are transferred to Brussels. Finally, what about education in England, from early years to university funding for the next generation of young voters? This is a core issue for the Liberal Democrats, who are promising to protect the education budget from cradle to college. Labour want to cut university tuition fees to £6,000 a year. The Conservatives say they’ll create at least 500 more free schools in England by 2020. In the past, politicians haven’t always kept the promises they’ve made in the heat of an election battle and this time round, if no-one wins outright, smaller parties might have a much greater influence. Vicky Young, BBC News. Full details of the parties - and where they stand on all the issues - are on the BBC News website. They’re in the policy guide section of the Election 2015 page. A brief look at some of the day’s other other news stories. Researchers say a new screening technique could dramatically improve the diagnosis of ovarian cancer. A 1lI-year trial, involving nearly 50,000 women, suggests the test is twice as effective as current ways of detecting the disease. Aid agencies are warning that a lack of shelter, contaminated water and poor sanitation following the earthquake in Nepal could lead to a serious outbreak of disease. More than 7,500 people are known to have died. The Queen has met her new great-granddaughter, Princess Charlotte, for the first time at Kensington Palace. Meanwhile, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have formally registered Princess Charlotte’s birth, documenting the date and place of birth and her full name as Her Royal Highness Princess Charlotte Elizabeth Diana of Cambridge. A former senior IRA man has been shot dead in a street in Belfast. No-one has so far claimed responsibility for the murder of Gerard Davison. He was linked to one of the IRA’s most notorious killings back in 2005. Let’s go to our Ireland correpondent, Chris Buckler. Chris, what more can you tell us about this? Green Goddess dpd was a prominent member of the IRA at one time. He was a well-known figure in the Markets area of Belfast, where he was shot dead this morning. After the shooting members of his family and friends gathered in the street there, visibly upset, among them children. He was involved in the wider controversy surrounding a notorious murder in 2005. It’s claimed he was involved in a bar fight ahead of the stabbing of Robert McCartney. The case made international headlines it was claimed that IRA members were involved at a time when the organisation was supposed to be on ceasefire and at a crucial period in Northern Ireland’s peace process. The police wouldn’t talk about motive as regards the murder of Mr Davison. They did say that no-one’s past was justification for a shooting like this. Fiona. Thank you. Dozens of migrants have drowned after a dinghy carrying over a 130 people sank south of Sicily. Ao people are believed to have fallen into the sea as a ship approached to rescue them. 7,000 migrants have made the dangerous crossing from North Africa across the Mediterranean in the past three days. james Reynolds reports from Catania in Sicily. This is what it’s like to scramble for your life in the Mediterranean sea. These pictures were filmed by a crew member on board the ZN container ship. Migrants are desperate to clamber on board. Some panic and fall into the water. The ship’s crew throw down life jackets. Migrants use empty fuel containers to stay afloat. The charity, Save the Children, says that several dozen migrants may have drowned in this weekend’s rescues when they fell from one of their dinghies. All survivors have been taken to port. These survivors are part of a recent surge in migration. Traffickers have taken advantage of better weather to launch many, many boats from North Africa, but the vessels these migrants have been forced to sail in are still dangerous and overcrowded. james Reynolds, BBC News, Catania. Now, with the polls suggesting the outcome of the general election is wide open, how rural areas vote could have a big impact. Almost 20% of people in England, Scotland and Wales live in the countryside, with nearly Ao marginal seats in England alone. Our correspondent, Claire Marshall, has been talking to voters in the Cotswolds. The Cotswolds is a place that charms tens of millions of tourists each year. It provides a rural sanctuary for billionaires and it’s home to almost 90,000 voters. So what are some of the issues that matter here? Firstly, rural broadband or the lack of it. If I was looking to download a programme file, if I was doing that at home it would take me literally a matter of two or three minutes. To do that here could take a matter of an hour to two hours. It’s reducing the pace at which I can grow my business in a market where my competitors are just as active. Around 12 million people call the countryside home. Wages are around 20% lower, house prices some 11 times the average salary and twice as much is spent on travel. And then there is farming. Milk prices have collapsed, businesses are going under. 19-year-old Danielle travels the country helping farmers to rear calves. She believes voters shouldn’t just look to politicians for answers. How optimistic do you and your friends feel about the future of trying to live and work in the countryside? I think you can be as optimistic as you want as long as you’re willing to notjust follow what the family has done for years. You have to be willing to look at the future and actually run at it. So for voters here it’s about who best understands the landscape and the unique nature of the countryside. Claire Marshall, BBC News, in the Cotswolds. Time for a look at the weather, here’s Louise Lear. It was a windy day this. Image behind me, thanks to Martin in Bournemouth, was a typical scene along the south coast. I suspect today you are more likely to suffer from wind burn than sun burn, the winds have been a significant feature. They will continue to be a feature through this evening as we see gale force gusts running up across the channel coasts into the south-east. Potential for further damage. We have seen isolated trees down. The showers continuing through the evening, the winds are a feature as well. By tomorrow morning it certainly looks as though we will continue to see rain in the far north. The area of low pressure, uncertainty where it will sit, a wet and windy start. There will be showers merging for longer spells of rain to the west. It will be a disappointing start to the day. Central and eastern areas there will be some showers, but hopefully a little more isolated here. As the day continues the winds will remain a feature. They will be spiralling around that low, driving those showers in from west to east. Some of them remaining heavy. The winds will be a feature too. Highs of 10-15 Celsius. If you escape the showers you will be lucky indeed. I do have a glimmer of good news as we move out of Wednesday into Thursday. That area of low pressure causing theissues That area of low pressure causing the issues drifts off into Scandinavia. For polling day things look a little quieter, certainly dryer with some sunny spells coming through and lighter winds. Highs likely of 17 degrees. Enjoy. Thank you very much. look a little quieter, certainly dryer with some sunny spells coming you very much. Our main story. The party leaders have been campaigning in a final frenetic push for votes.

The Mayor of London, Borisjohnson, joined David Cameron today for a final push to win over the capital for the Conservatives. Consistently rated for the Conservatives. Consistently rated as the party’s most popular politician, he has been touted as its main weapons.

Mayor has been all over the place, recognised everywhere, even if the spelling isn’t always up to the mark. We all know that Boris is running to be the next Conservative Party leader, not really helping this campaign. So it isn’t going to make a difference? I don’t think so. People are wondering which candidate has campaigned the hardest for them. Nice to see you. Has his campaigning being for the benefit of the Conservatives or the benefit of Boris johnson? benefit of the Conservatives or the benefit of Borisjohnson? -- benefit of the Conservatives or the benefit of Borisjohnson? -- your campaigning. I have decided that it is best to be as useful as I can, as I’m sure you know. I and simultaneously on the phone to City Hall the whole time. -- I am the simultaneously. Those London battle grounds are the key marginals which could be decisive in an election that is still too close to call. We are in Surbiton whether Mayor has been campaigning today. What difference do you think he is making? -- the Mayor. He seems to be having an impact at this moment in time. The key ingredient is having a few activists with him, crucially, a couple of photographers. It causes its own, creates its own momentum. There have been an awful lot of pictures taken with Boris. Is a celebrity recognition, having a laugh kind of thing? Or are people seeing this as translating into something else? He has definitely got that reach. One passer-by what’s past me and said, what is Boris johnson doing here? They weren’t quite buzzing him in that context. That makes me wonder about whether that leads to anything major, you know, from here. As we have heard from time to time, the selection is too close to call. Has the conservative strategy change during this survey? It is been a dual strategy. The Conservatives tell you they can win but a lot of others will say that is wishful thinking. Vince Cable has a majority in Twickenham of 12,000. Ed Davey has majority of 7,500. They’re trying to defend five or six seats held by not a particularly big majority. That will be the crucial test of Boris’s reach, whether they can hold onto seats. Thank you. Coming up later in the programme: How the rise of Londoners living on the water is putting pressure on the capital’s canals. New screening technique could dramatically improve the diagnosis of ovarian cancer. Researchers from University College London - who conducted a 1lI-year trial involving nearly 50,000 women - say it suggests that the test is twice as effective as current ways of detecting the disease, and could lead to a national screening programme. Here’s Victoria Hollins. Blood tests for ovarian cancer are not new but the way the tests were done during this trial is new. That could help women like Caroline in the future. She did not recognise the symptoms she was having as ovarian cancer. That is why it is sometimes referred to as the silent killer. It is easy to mistake it for something else. I has persistent cramps and persistent backache. It was getting worse. This revival improves greatly if it is detected early, which is where this test could help. -- is detected early, which is where this test could help. -- the survival. They normally test for a specific protein, but in this trial, rather than look at one fixed level, they looked at how the protein level changed over time. They followed nearly 50,000 women for over ten years. They picked out nearly nine out of ten ovarian cancer cases. That compares to less than half of cases detected using the current NHS testing methods. Looking at a level of a protein in the blood for a length of time is an interesting idea and one that is proving helpful. It is useful to look at these levels over time, because what is normal for one woman could be different to another. The second part of the studies still has not been published, and until it is, it is still too early to say whether early detection is fewer deaths. We need to see whether we have picked up these women early enough, such that treatment has saved their lives. Until that is clear, it makes a national screening programme unlikely. Apart from possibly saving lives, the screening could also bring it up to the same level aware -- the screening could also bring it up to the same level aware -- level of awareness that we now have about breast cancer. Further tests are needed. An army recruitment Sergeant has been found guilty of sex attacks on young women. The court heard that he abused his power to bully and grooming young female cadets. The jury found him not guilty of three offences and will keep on considering five other charges tomorrow. A former teacher at one of the country’s leading private schools has pleaded guilty to possessing and making thousands of indecent images of children. Anthony Fuggle, was a Classics master at Colet Court the junior section of St Paul’s Prep School in Barnes. He’s the first person to be charged under the Met’s ‘Operation Winthorpe’, which was set up to investigate allegations of abuse at the school. He’ll be sentenced next month. For days, the Nepalese community in south east London has been collecting for victims of the earthquake - a million of them children. Organisers in Woolwich have been overwhelmed with food, clothes and toys - some of which has already reached those affected. But say they’re frustrated with the difficulties of trying to get all of their donations to those who desperately need it. As Ayshea Buksh reports The donations keep coming and coming. From all over London, people have brought emergency supplies to Woolwich town Hall. The appeal went out after the earthquake struck. Two tonnes of aid has already reached villages near the earthquake’s at the centre, but there is still much more to go. The material we receive is very overwhelming. We have negotiated with the airlines to ship this for free. Once we sense that loss of items, we don’t want any more. While they wait for the airlines and cargo companies to fly out the remaining eight, the items less must be sorted by volunteers. I try to think, I hope these things get there. I sensed some positive vibes. Hopefully, these people find a little bit of peace. At the moment, I’m doing nothing so I had better do something here. A vigil was held in Woolwich in honour of the -- A vigil was held in Woolwich in honour of the -- in honour of the earthquake victims.

The first ever ‘enforcement’ notice ordering a building to be rebuilt brick by brick, could be issued this evening. Westminster City Council are currently meeting to decide whether to order the owners of a 1920s pub - demolished while it was being considered for listed building status - to rebuild it. Alex Bushill is in Westminster now. Remind us what’s happened. ~ Iam I am outside City Hall and there are some campaigners here outside.

The owners of the building had had a previous application to demolish the building rejected. What is happening tonight is that the council are going to decide whether they will be forced to rebuild the public, brick by brick, at their own cost. Why is it so important that they rebuilt the pub? It was a community hub rather than just a pub. This is a place where generations of % immunity have been coming. They have been bonding. We have seen deaths, births, the lots in this pub.-- have seen deaths, births, the lots in this pub. -- generations of the same community. Across London, we are seeing pubs like this be demolished because of the huge need for housing. You are fighting a losing battle. I don’t think we are fighting a losing battle. We are not talking about buildings that will be flattened for affordable housing. This is somewhere that local people will never be able to afford to live in. Thank you forjoining me this evening. We are filming the meeting and will have the results of that decision in our late bulletin. Next, the rise of the houseboat, due to unaffordable house prices in London. Some areas, like Hackney, have seen an 85% increase in the number of boats in the last year alone. And it’s putting a strain on the capital’s waterways. Life on the water is slow, so it might surprise you that more and more Londoners are taking to the canals. House prices are the reason. I used to work in the city in banking. I decided to go back to university and do something different. I realised there was no way I would be able to afford university and living in London. Then I bought a boat. Renting a1 London. Then I bought a boat. Renting a 1 bedroom flat here in Hackney costs about £350 per week. It doesn’t cost Peter much more than that to repay the loan on his boat for a month. To have a boat, you need a licence which usually costs a few hundred pounds per year. You need to commit to moving your boat every couple of weeks, because permanent moorings are few and far between and they are auctioned off to the highest bidder. The last one that went in Islington was auctioned for £18,000 per year. Some people are not moving their boats like they’re supposed to. The amount in Hackney has gone up by 85% in one year. The organisation that runs the waterways say that is putting pressure on resources. There are a lot of challenges involved in boating. It may not be convenient if you have a fixed lifestyle and a job in a particular place. We encourage people to consider boating as a lifestyle rather than an easy choice for accommodation. But affordable homes are hard to come by. Turning to the water has clearly been too tempting for many. We will explain why faces of Londoners are appearing on various street corners. I think I look a bit like Bobby Robson. And the birthplace of British cinema flickers back to life in Regent Street. If you stayed up last night to watc the snooker, you’ll have seen Basildon’s Stuart Bingham became the oldest man since 1978 to win the World Championship. Our sport reporter Sara orchard’s here, and fair to say an extremely popular win with fans? He isa He is a self-confessed snooker deep. That is why he is loved by the fans. -- a snooker nerd. Many people thought that’s 2015 would not be his year. Now at 38 years old, the underdogs beat Ronnie O’Sullivan. He finally got his final tickets. He beat Shaun Murphy by 18 frames to 50. What about the reaction in Basildon? The town has absolutely loved it. All the members were at the club last night. It went on very late into the evening. Some people had made thejourney to into the evening. Some people had made the journey to Sheffield to watching live. Can tell by this little message from some of them at the club today what it means, not just to Stuart Bingham but to ban. He is very dedicated. He’s here all the time. As I say, he comes on when he wants to. He’s got his keys to come in. He’s in early in the morning, some mornings, or he’s here in the afternoon. He’s always here. It was a dream come true for Stuart and, obviously, all the people here are really happy for him. I was talking to him this morning. We should also give some credit is to Stuart Bingham’s family. His wife and daughter were there last night. As the final started, you could hear a little voice at the back of beyond a Tory in saying, good luck, daddy.

It’s not an area known for street art but there’s been a sudden surge of spray painting across Fitzrovia in the past few weeks. Builders, students, artists and a pub dog are just some of the characters who have seen their portraits spring up on traffic light boxes in the area.

It’s strange to what past and see a picture of yourself. I think I look a bit like Bobby Robson. Maybe that’s howl a bit like Bobby Robson. Maybe that’s how I look anyway!

It’s been tucked away off one of London’s busiest shopping streets for years, with many people unaware of its importance. But the Regent Street cinema holds a special place in film history as one of the first locations to show a public screening of moving images almost 120 years ago. Closed for decades, it’s now reopening its doors, as Graham Satchell reports. It was here on Regent Street in 1896 that history was made. The Lumiere brothers came over from France with their cinematograph, and it was in this building that people saw, for the first time, moving pictures. It is why this is known as the birthplace of British cinema. This is what the first audience saw. It was shocking. Some people in the theatre screamed, worried that the train would hit them. It was obviously a moment of history... Simon’s grandmother was at the first screening and wrote about it in a letter to her father. Auntie Minnie took us to see the photographs that move, you know, like real life. It was delightful. I think that it caused some flight, actually, particularly the train coming into the station. One hears that the audience were terrified. They thought they were going to be run into. The theatre on Regent Street was known for its innovation. In the 1840s, it held dramatic public scientific experiments, then some of the first Magic Lantern shows. It was the natural choice for the Lumiere brothers to show their photographs that moved, like real life. This is the birthplace of British cinema, and I think you can feel the magic in this space. You walk into it and you just think about the wonderful, momentous events that have happened here. Westminster University has now spent £6 million to bring the cinema back to life. When it reopens tomorrow, it will show new films, student films and some of the very first films, like this, shot by the Lumiere brothers 120 years ago. Time for a check on the weather with Wendy. We still have some windy days to come. Today has been very windy and we will see more gusty winds through tomorrow. Still with that mixture of bright spells and heavy showers. We saw some rain moving through the night, heading northwards. The cloud was well broken following on behind, so we have had some sunshine. A few showers out of the West but it has been strong and gusty winds that have been a feature. They will start to ease as we go through the night. Perhaps around 20 mph. Still seeing some showers moving across. The breeze holds temperatures up as lows of around 7 degrees. Tomorrow morning, one or two showers around. We will gradually see those showers building through the afternoon. There will be some drier and brighter spells in between. By the afternoon, heavier downpours and the winds will pick up. We could see them gusting at times up to 50 mph. Not a particularly warm day. Temperatures atjust Ill Not a particularly warm day. Temperatures at just Ill or 15 degrees. In the wind, it will feel quite cool. We will start to see things settling down by the time we get to Thursday. Much lighter winds and a dry day in store, with some bright spells. The odd cloud around but throughout the day, warming up quite nicely. Temperatures through Thursday afternoon should reach highs of around Devon team degrees Celsius. With those light winds, it will feel much better than Wednesday. -- With those light winds, it will feel much better than Wednesday. -- highs of around 17 degrees. The day’s main headlines: On the penultimate day of campaigning, David Cameron has warned again against an SNP backed Labour government, and Ed Miliband said he believed Labour would not borrow more money than the Conservatives. Dozens of migrants have drowned after a dinghy carrying over 130 people sank south of Sicily. A new screening technique, developed by researchers from University College London, could dramatically improve the diagnosis of ovarian cancer. That’s it for now, thanks forjoining us. I’ll be back with the latest during the 10pm news, and lots more on our website. Have a lovely evening. In just a little time now, you can decide who’s going to run the country for the next five years. Over the past five years, the Conservatives have taken an economy that Labour left in ruins... ..and started to mend it. Thanks to the British people’s hard work, we now have an economy where every day there are 500 more businesses... ..1,000 jobs are created... ..where there are more people in work than ever before. Wages are rising faster than prices. And last year, ours was Europe’s fastest-growing major economy. Now, on Thursday, you can vote for all this to continue or, on Friday morning, wake up to Ed Miliband, propped up by the SNP, and find... this. It’s working. Don’t let them wreck it. Let’s turn the clock back five years. When Labour were last in office, they left behind this note - ""There is no money."" After spending and borrowing too much, Labour’s legacy was a deficit almost as large as that of Greece. So over the past five years, that is what we’ve had to mend, that is what our long-term economic plan has been all about. And there are now two million more people in work with the security of a pay packet. There are 760,000 more businesses. We’ve halved the deficit as a share of our economy, while cutting income tax for over 26 million people. And last year, thanks to the hard work of the British people, we were the fastest-growing major economy in Europe. And if we stick to the plan, we can look forward to a brighter, more secure future. So vote for the Conservatives on Thursday and you will have the security of a plan that is working. You’ll have stable government and the strong economy on which our schools, our NHS and your family’s future depend. But vote for any other party, and Britain’s recovery could be stopped dead in its tracks. Ed Miliband, propped up by the SNP, would wreck the recovery with more debt, more borrowing and more taxes. And this will be the result. So on Thursday, vote to keep our economy strong and our future bright. Vote Conservative. He is coming, you know. The Raven... is coming. Hello, and welcome to your Tuesday One Show with Matt Baker... And Alexjones. Now, it’s always nice to have a friend drop in for a chat. And you can definitely say tonight’s guest is a friend. Sorry, it was a reflex! I couldn’t help it, when FS Tecumseh at your face, you duck! Look! -- help it, when FS Tecumseh at your face, you duck! Look! -- when a fist comes at your face. Welcome back, Matt LeBlanc! That was a cracker! Movie magic! You did not really punch Ross in the face? I wanted to, he owed me did not really punch Ross in the face? Iwanted to, he owed me money! That was a tough seem to get through with a straight face. Is there a story about before that? When he went to punch me, there is a poll in the coffee shop, an ornate steel post, and they brought in a special one with a soft spot for him to punch, they measured where it should go and they put it in the wrong spot! He didn’t break his hand but it hurt. So he is holding his fist for a reason. Allah we look forward to talking about the new series of Episodes. -- to talking about the new series of Episodes. -- we look forward to. We have a giant map of Britain outside built for the coverage of the election results on Thursday night. There has been a lot of buzz. With two days to go, Alex Riley is hosting the great One Show manifesto lock in from Blackpool. Oh, I do like lock in from Blackpool. Oh, Ido like to be beside the seaside. The Cerner is shining, I have my bucket and spade, my stick of rock, I am hoping to get lucky. -- the sun is shining. So what are we doing? Reading party manifestos? ! I was hoping for Alexjones’s autobiography. How many of you will be reading any manifestos? Last time around, apparently only a quarter of voters made the effort. Should we PHY voters made the effort. Should we pay more attention? Have you read any manifestos? No. No. Idon’t understand it. Tonight, we are having a manifesto lock in, asking a group of undecided voters to read all 156,000 words of the main party manifestos in England to see if it helps them make a decision. I want you to clear your mind up anything you think you know about a party. Don’tjudge a book by its you think you know about a party. Don’t judge a book by its cover. Start reading. The first manifesto was published by the Conservative Party in 1834. That then, it was the only one on offer, whereas this lot have five to read in two hours. Downstairs we are hosting a pub quiz to test decided voters on whether they really know the policies of the party they plan to vote for. How confident are you that you can identify Labour policies against the other parties? People always say there is no difference, there are clear differences. But have you read the other manifestos? The Conservative one and the Ukip one. I have read all 83 pages. 89, actually. So you have not read the last six pages? You have read the manifesto? All of it? No. Is it quite heavy going? They are all a bit heavy going. Not many people bother to read party manifestos, is there any point in them? It is probably the most important document of any party, because it is what lays down their policies. Are you confident you will be able to tell the difference between which policies belong to which parties? I think we have a broad knowledge range, let’s see what happens. Time to put them to the test with a One Show manifesto pub quiz. Which party says it will invest £13 billion in transport for the North of England? Which party manifesto uses the word you the most? The Liberal Democrats only have one team member, which could be a disadvantage. The Labour Party have got so many people that they could get in each other’s way. Upstairs, the undecided voters have been wading through the manifestos for over an hour. been wading through the manifestos for overan hour. How for over an hour. How are you finding it? Some of the manifestos are easier to read than others. The Ukip one is very easy to read. I don’t think anybody could criticise it, but it is short on detail. The Labour one is very thick, I don’t know if anybody would get more than 30 questions in. I still don’t have any answers to my questions. Any chance of a drink? It is important to concentrate! Which party says it will increase ",,
183,BBC News 24,5-may-2015,BBC News at Ten,22:00,30 mins,True,"Tonight at Ten, one full day of campaigning to go and the party leaders are leaving nothing to chance. Nick Clegg warns that without the Lib Dems in coalition, there’ll be no stability and the likelihood of a second election. The last thing that Britain needs is a second election before Christmas. David Cameron warns that a Labour government backed by the SNP would be a ""chilling prospect"". And Ed Miliband tells the BBC that Labour’s plans would not mean more borrowing than the Conservatives. We’re in the BBC election studio with all the news from the campaign trail and the day’s other main stories. In Nigeria, intense emotion as hundreds are rescued from the clutches of Boko Haram extremists. More migrants rescued in the Mediterranean - but dozens of lives were lost on the way. If everybody has the right to ask a question and get it asks. And a taste of elections past as we ask how much has changed half a century on. In sport, Newcastle captain Fabrizio Coloccini writes a letter to fans apologising for the poor form that saw them lose eight straight league matches. Good evening from the BBC’s election studio. This is our home this week and this is where we’ll bring you all the results and reaction on Thursday and Friday. just one full day of campaigning left before the polling stations open on Thursday morning and party leaders are trying to cover as much of the UK as possible. Nick Clegg has started a two-day tour - from Land’s End tojohn 0’Groats. Ed Miliband has been visiting key seats in Wales and the South of England. But we start with David Cameron, who’s been campaigning in London and the South West of England, as Gavin Hewitt reports. The final stretch. It is testimony to a knife edge campaign. The photo opportunities in the pouring rain are still worth a detour. David Cameron pass -- are still worth a detour. David Cameron pass -- David Cameron’s last push, open to the occasional heckler. On to Hendon, another marginal, with Borisjohnson as his warm up act. His closing argument was not to gamble with the economic recovery. He warns of chaos, Labour making backroom deals with the SNP, of the risk of voting Liberal Democrat. If you vote Liberal Democrat you do not know what you will get. Nick Clegg was clear, he is just as likely to support and Ed Miliband-SNP government that will bring the country to a halt, as he is to support the Conservatives. If you prefer me as Prime Minister, vote conservative. Onto the West Country and seats the Tories must win from the Lib Dems to form a government. In these final stops, David Cameron is trying to get the voters to focus on two key questions, who did a best trust to run the economy and who do they trust to be Prime Minister? At every stop he reminds the audience of the legacy of labour. Ifeel stop he reminds the audience of the legacy of labour. I feel like the firefighter hosing down the burning building and there is Ed Miliband, the guy who lit the building the first place. That is why we need another five years, to first place. That is why we need anotherfive years, to make another five years, to make sure more are in work, lower taxes, more homes. David Cameron remains confident, but has warned of a credibility problem if a government was formed by a party that did not have the most seats. It is notjust about winning outright, it is a push to win the most seats, so important in earning the right to be given the first chance to form the next government. As we said Nick Clegg has embarked on a two-day tour from Land’s End to john O’Groats, insisting that the Lib Dems are the only party who’ll ‘guarantee stability’ in the event of a hung parliament. He warned of the prospect of a second election before Christmas if the Conservatives or Labour tried to govern without a majority. Kamal Ahmed has been speaking to Mr Clegg. His last visit to his constituency before the polls opened, Nick Clegg ended a 16 hour day of campaigning with the plea to vote Liberal Democrat or face another election before Christmas. If you want to avoid the shambles of an unstable minority government, if you want to avoid the shambles of a second general election before Christmas, you have got to vote Lib Dem. Nick Clegg believes the Liberal Democrats will learn many of their 56 seats, including his own in Sheffield. It raises the question, who would the Liberal Democrats go into coalition with? Nick Clegg said he was open to offers from the party, Conservative or Labour, who does best, as long as they agreed to read lines of education and health spending. The party if it reaches out to us, we will talk to them, they know our red lines. It started at land ‘s end and crisscrossed the country. This journey will end in john O’Groats. The Lib Dem target on Thursday is to win more than 30 seats and play a role as kingmakers in the next government. Ed Miliband has told the BBC he does not believe Labour would end up borrowing more money than the Conservatives plan to if he forms the next government. The Labour leader said he did not accept the suggestion that debt would be higher towards the end of the next parliament if Labour’s plans were implemented. In the latest of our series of interviews with the party leaders, he’s been speaking to our deputy political editorjames Landale. He could be just hours from climbing to the highest office in the land. On the way, he has been ridiculed and written off, but today Ed Miliband told me he was convinced that he was heading for Downing Street. No, I am ready to change this country for working people. And I see it as my duty to change this country for working people, because I believe that if David Cameron got back into power, he would wreck this country for working people, and I will not let his wrecking crew get back and wreck the chances for working families. But why was his confidence not matched by voters who still question his ability to run the economy? There is a big choice at this election. Do you believe that the way a country succeeds is with the wealth trickling down from the few at the top, or do you believe a country succeeds by putting working people first? That is the big choice. Have you ever made a profit? Have you ever worked in an organisation that makes a profit? Do you understand what it means? You can understand what it means without having been a business person. I have not run a business. Do you have friends who run businesses? Of course, but the reality is, what I know from them is what they want is a government that will work with them. The problem is that some voters think that you look at a business or an organisation that makes a profit, and your first instinct is to tax it, regulate it, control it. No, my first instinct is to work with those businesses so they succeed. Let me give an example. I took on the big six energy companies in the interests of millions of businesses and families who were not getting a fair deal. The future of this country will depend on millions more successful businesses. He said Labour would eliminate the deficit as soon as possible and get debt falling. Would you borrow more than the Conservatives plan to? I do not believe it. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said debt will be 90 billion more in 2019 if Labour’s plans were implemented, that if the Conservatives plans were implemented. Ido not agree with that. He said the Tories had failed on deficit cuts. The Tories accused him of being misleading about borrowing plans. The IFS stood by its view. You are not planning to get rid of the overall deficit. The credibility of the deficit plan is does it add up, will it work? Will Labour win a majority. Today he acknowledged he may have to work with other parties, revealing his plans to abolish tax free non-dom status would not be up for negotiation. Any government I lead will get rid of non-dom status. I want one rule for all. Whatever government it is, my government will do it. Non-dom, non-negotiable? Anything else? Lots of things. His decision to get policy promises carved in stone has prompted much derision. Today, one of his campaign she’s got in a muddle, saying Ed Miliband would stand by the tablet of stone, but then appeared to question its permanence. Ido not think anyone is suggesting carved in stone he means he is absolutely not going to break them, or anything like that. You might break your promises? Not at all, carved in stone, delivered by a Labour government. I am clear about it. It has been a long campaign and a personaljourney, I that even now is not short of surprises. In a matter of hours, we and he will find out if the country has said, hell yes, or, hell no. New figures released by the European Commission have forecast Britain to be the fastest growing economy in Europe this year. Although UK growth has been revised down slightly since the last forecast, it is still predicted to be higher than Germany and France. Our economics editor Robert Peston has been asking some of the parties how they’d plan to sustain growth in the years ahead. Building Britain for future prosperity. With growth slowing down a bit, what are the parties doing to keep the economy moving forward? No, I’m still... The Chancellor. ...of course, the Chancellor. You are. Probably the thing that I’ve had to keep the closest eye on is the Greek situation and it looks like that will now come to a head in the days after the general election. I mean, here we are at a big rogue building project. --road. Some economists would say borrowing for investment like this is a good thing. Why have you ruled that out? Well, this project here in Lancashire has been waiting to be built for 1+0 years, but because we’ve the public finances under control, we can afford to make our investments in our country’s future. We can afford to invest in the north of England and rebalance our economy. The train to a rosier or bleaker future? Labour’s Ed Balls would get the national debt down slower than the Tories because he would borrow to invest for future growth. George hasn’t got my mobile number? That’s what he says. You’ll have to text him. There we are. I think the thing is you, you know, the one thing people aren’t expecting is a coalition with me and George. Britain’s manufacturing future, microwave ovens made by a japanese company in Cardiff. Labour was in power for 13 years, weren’t you wrong to become so dependant on revenues generated by a city that was out of control? Look, it’s really important to have a balanced economy and financial services are important in that, but they’ve got to be regulated in a tough way. We need more manufacturing, advance manufacturing. We need to make sure that our creative industries, our media, our English language, our universities, a broad-based economy, based on exports and investment. If Danny Alexander keeps his seat, he may have a say OI’I OUT âCOI’IOITIiC tOITIOI’IâoWS. Our pledge is to keep the UK together. To make sure the UK’s leading in the European Union, not leaving it, and to finish the job of balancing the books and doing so in a fair way. Dismal Scottish weather, not in a political sense for the SNP. We think there’s a need to undertake modest increases in public expenditure by half a per cent above inflation to start fuelling the process of growth within the economy, it would still result in debt and the deficit reducing year-on-year over the course of the next parliament. So in all the talk of which party will best fill the budgetary hole, we also need to think which is most likely to stimulate the economy over the coming five years because we can’t get richer without growth. Robert Peston, BBC News. The SNP Leader, Nicola Sturgeon, has been campaigning at a nursery in West Lothian. She told journalists that if Scots voted for a large number of SNP MPs, Scotland would be demanding that its voice be heard loud and clear at Westminster. Ukip has suspended a candidate after he made racist remarks about one of his opponents and threatened to shoot him ‘between the eyes’ if he ever became prime minister. Robert Blay, who was standing in North East Hampshire, was filmed making the comments to an undercover reporter. Ukip called the remarks 'abhorrent’ and said Mr Blay had apologised to Ranil jayawadena. Meanwhile, on the campaign trail, Ukip leader Nigel Farage spent the day in Kent. He’s urged people to ""vote with their heart"" as no party would win an outright majority. I think we’re holding up remarkably well under an onslaught from everybody. Lots of ridiculous things being said. ""Please don’t vote Ukip or the sky will fall in."" All this sort of nonsense. And actually our supporters believe in what we’re trying to do, we’re re-engaging people who haven’t voted in many, many years. Yeah, I’m excited about it still. Our deputy political editorjames Landale is at Westminster. How did things stand? Everything might seem familiarfor How did things stand? Everything might seem familiar for this stage of the campaign with party leaders frantically out campaigning, you’ll have the party spin doctors trying to manage expectations and the party machines frantically trying to organise volunteers to help them get people out to vote. So much, so traditional. Underneath that, the mood is very different. I think there is a strain of uncertainty pervading the parties. Normally they sense which way the wind is going, voters want change, or more of the same will stop this time, the politicians, pollsters and media are struggling to read the election and thatis struggling to read the election and that is why there is so much focus on an uncertain result. Thursday might not be the end of the process, merely the calling of the half-time whistle. There could be a process of protracted negotiation if no party wins out right and also Nick Clegg has raised the speculation there could be a second general election this year. I think that will concentrate one or two minds. Let’s turn to some of the day’s other main stories. More than 700 women and children have been rescued from the clutches of Boko Haram extremists in the past week, according to the Nigerian army. It follows the army’s latest advances in Boko Haram’s last stronghold, the vast Sambisa Forest. Our correspondent Will Ross has travelled to Yola, where some of the captured women spoke to him about their experiences. There are distressing details in the report. An extraordinary family reunion. 15-year-old Fatima was kidnapped by Boko Haram when she was visiting her uncle six months ago. Her family didn’t know if she was dead or alive. The shy teenager was clearly traumatised by what she’s been through. Many of the captives were forced to watch as people were killed in front of them. Fatima says all she wants to do now is go back to school. Nigeria’s military has been on the offensive to destroy the camps in the jihadist stronghold of the Sambisa Forest. This footage shows the chaotic scenes as Boko Haram fighters flee for their lives in trucks, on motorbikes and some just running for it. At the same time, their captives, hundreds of women and children, are led to safety by the military. I’ve been hearing from those who witnessed the terrifying dash for freedom. This woman was held by Boko Haram for a year. She was separated from her seven and eight-year-old sons, who are still in the hands of the jihadists. TRANSLATION: Boko Haram heard the military were coming and told us to move deep into the forest but we refused. We were too exhausted and our children sick. They started shooting. Then suddenly the military arrived. They were also firing, so we were shouting, ""Don’t shoot, don’t shoot! We are women and children!"" People here tell me at least 15 of the captives died, most in the crossfire during the gun battle. Imagine what it was like for 27-year-old Lami, who gave birth to her child in the forest just the day before the military rescued them. She tells me how grim life was under Boko Haram. TRANSLATION: Every day they would come around and tell us we were infidels, that we should convert and accept their religion. Some days they beat us. Sometimes they would starve us of food and even water. These women and children are very lucky to have made it out alive. But they’ve will come here with appalling stories of brutality that they witnessed whilst in captivity. Over the past week, the Nigerian military says almost 700 women and children have been rescued. What we don’t know is how many more are still being held by the jihadists. No-one here had any news of the missing 219 Chibok schoolgirls. The search for them goes on. Those that are now free are haunted by what they experienced. Life in the bush has taken its toll but now, away from the brutality ofjihadist rule, they have a second chance in life. Will Ross, BBC News, north-east Nigeria. More migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean from North Africa to Europe are said to have drowned. Survivors who made the journey from Libya were eventually brought ashore on the island of Sicily and reported around Ao fatalities. They’re among hundreds of migrants who have drowned in recent days. Our correspondent james Reynolds reports from the Sicilian port of Catania. This is what it’s like to scramble for your life in the Mediterranean Sea. These pictures were filmed by a crew member on board the ZN container ship. Migrants are desperate to clamber on board. Some panic and fall into the water. The ship’s crew throw down life jackets. Migrants use empty fuel containers to stay afloat. The charity Save the Children says that several dozen migrants may have drowned in this weekend’s rescues when they fell from one of their dinghies. All survivors have been taken to port. These survivors are part of a recent surge in migration. Traffickers have taken advantage of better weather to launch many, many boats from North Africa, but the vessels these migrants have been forced to sail in are still dangerous and overcrowded. james Reynolds, BBC News, Catania. Mental health Trusts in England say they’re expecting further significant cuts to their funding over the next four years. BBC News has seen figures for almost three-quarters of trusts, which suggest they’re predicting a fall in income of about ÂlI70 million. NHS England has said the figures don’t paint a true picture of mental health funding. Scientists say a new blood test could dramatically improve the diagnosis of ovarian cancer. Using a blood test appears to be twice as effective as previous methods, although the researchers at University College London say it is too early to tell whether the approach would save lives. The Queen has visited Kensington Palace to see her new great-granddaughter, Princess Charlotte, who was born on Saturday. The Princess is fourth in line to the throne. Meanwhile, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have formally registered the birth, giving their occupations as Prince and Princess of the United Kingdom. A former senior IRA member has been shot dead in a street in Belfast. No-one has so far admitted responsibility for the murder of Gerard Davison. He was linked to one of the IRA’s most notorious killings, the murder of Robert McCartney in 2005. Our Ireland correspondent Chris Buckler is in Belfast now. just tell us a bit more on the background to this. Gerard Davidson was a prominent remember of the IRA and a very well-known figure in the Markets area where he was today. -- Gerard Davidson. Many are deeply upset by this, including children. He was involved in the wider controversy surrounding the murder of Robert McCartney and you might remember he was stabbed to death and there were allegations members of the IRA were involved and allegations that the IRA covered it up, and as a result, it made international headlines. It was a time when the IRA was supposed to be on ceasefire and indeed a very sensitive time for the peace process. Today the police would not talk about motives as far as the murder was concerned but they did say no action in the past should have led to a shooting like this. Thank you for the update. That was Chris Buckler in Belfast. In Scotland , where the Scottish National Party are expected to make unprecedented gains on Thursday, the former prime minister, Labour’s Gordon Brown, has appealed for Scots who believe in socialjustice to vote Labour. Mr Brown is not standing for re-election in Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, where he had a 23,000 majority last time. But as Gavin Esler reports, even Kircaldy is now in the SNP’s sights. If you want to see what this election looks like, this could bring possibly extraordinary political change. The retiring MP, Gordon Brown, has been campaigning hard for his Labour Party successor, defending an impregnable 23,000 majority, except... It isn’t. The SNP think they can win here and perhaps everywhere, raising, they say, big questions about the legitimacy of any Westminsterjunk --, without Scottish support. At this splendid golf club, some fear an SNP landslide could bring chaos but others want a much bigger safer Scotland. Even if we are not in how it will be nice for Scotland to be treated fairly, equally and get a say in more of the UK. We certainly want more of a say without actually being in charge. I keep hearing the SNP is going to be a whitewash. I don’t think so and I don’t think it would be a good thing if it did. And I still think I would prefer the union. The SNP still seem to be pushing Labour out of Scotland as well, so overall for Great Britain, it must be important as well because they’re going to lose a lot of seats. The trouble is, you could end UP seats. The trouble is, you could end up with the UK coming out of Europe and with Scotland coming out of the union. And then going into Europe. Absolutely crazy. Father of economics, Adam Smith, was born here. His hard-headed pragmatism could come in handy if the SNP decides a future SNP government does not meet their test of legitimacy. Changing the political party you vote for is a big step and it’s even bigger to switch from any of the three unionist parties at Westminster to the SNP but that is precisely what tens of thousands of Scottish voters are considering doing this week. If they do do it, it will bring about a profound change notjust it will bring about a profound change not just to the politics of Scotland, but affecting everybody in the UK. Gavin Esler, BBC News. Withjust one full day of campaigning to go and after weeks of pledges and polls, millions of people have already voted by post, while millions of others are still weighing up the options. Our chief political correspondent Vicky Young has this guide to some of the key issues and where the parties stand. There is a lots on offer from politicians at election time as they outline a blizzard of promises to tempt voters their way. From health and education to Europe and the economy. Arguments about the economy have focused on reducing the deficit. That is the difference between what the government by Chris Spence and what it gets in through taxes. The Conservatives plan to cut billions from welfare and government departments in order to balance the books within two years. -- departments in order to balance the books within two years. -- what the government spends. And then they will pay off the debt. They have started with tax cuts but haven’t laid out what they would do on all of them. Labourwant laid out what they would do on all of them. Labour want higher taxes on the wealthy and they would continue to borrow for major projects like road-building. The Lib Dems are offering to balance the budget with a mixture of cuts and taxes on higher earners. They, like the Tories, also want to increase how much we can earn before paying tax. In contrast, the SNP is calling for a modest spending increased to allow for extra investment. The Green Party Plaid Cymru are also calling for an end to austerity. So what about health, which is a devolved issue? The head of NHS England says the head of NHS England says an required by 2020 and big savings will need to be found. Labour is promising an extra £2.5 billion a year to pay for more nurses, midwives and GPs. This will be paid for by a mansion tax, a levy on tobacco companies and a clamp-down on tax avoidance. The Conservatives have promised to find that £8 billion but have not said how. They want patients to have seven-day access to GPs. The Lib Dems say they would also increase NHS funding by 8 billion and extra resources would go into mental health. Then there is the issue of Europe and Britain’s membership of the EU. Here there are real differences between the parties. Leaving the EU is Ukip’s number one policy. They argue it is the only way for the UK to reduce immigration and they say it would save billions which could be spent on the NHS and tax cuts. The Conservatives have vowed to hold and in -Bob -- The Conservatives have vowed to hold and in -Bob -- in-out referendum and negotiate with their EU partners. By contrast, the Lib Dems are arguing to remain in the EU and they agree with Labour, who are against a referendum unless new powers are transferred to Brussels. Finally, what about education in England? From early years to university funding for the next generation of young voters? This is a core issue for the Lib Dems, who are promising to protect the education budget from cradle to college. Labour want college. Labour wa nt to cut college. Labour want to cut university tuition fees to £6,000 a year. And the Conservatives say they will create at least 500 more free schools in England by 2020. In the past, politicians haven’t always kept the promises they’ve made in the heat of an election battle and this time around, if nobody wins outright, smaller parties might have a much greater influence. And a full list of party polices can be found on the BBC News website - search for the policy guide section on the Election 2015 page. As the political leaders make their last-minute appeals to voters, how will the 2015 election campaign be remembered? Our political correspondent Chris Mason has been considering how this campaign has differed from previous ones. This is the kind of thing the parties don’t want you to see. The heckler forcibly removed. By contrast, heckler forcibly removed. By contrast, these are the pictures they do want you to see. As politics feels more presidential. And, boy, have we seen plenty of this! I’ve never known campaigned so controlled. You had David Cameron meeting supporters and big aircraft hangars, you had Ed Miliband that his lecture on trying to look Prime Minister real. They are all trying to avoid an embarrassing encounter ",,

As the political leaders make their last-minute appeals to voters, how will the 2015 election campaign be remembered? Our political correspondent, Chris Mason, has been considering how this campaign has differed from previous ones. This is the kind of thing the parties don’t want you to see. The heckler, forcibly removed. By contrast, these are the pictures they do want you to see as politics feels more presidential and, boy, have we seen plenty of this. I’ve never known a campaign so controlled. You’ve had David Cameron going around meeting loyal groups of supporters in big aircraft hangars. Ed Miliband accompanied everywhere by his lectern to try and look prime minsterial. I think they’re all desperate to avoid an embarrassing encounter with an ordinary voter of the kind of sort we had in previous election campaigns. David Cameron was at a garden centre in Twickenham in South West London this morning. It had been closed to the public for the visit. This is the start of the Prime Minister’s big last push of campaigning, 36-hours to go, covering 1,300 miles. But like many of these events, it’s mainly party activists rather than talking to members of the public. And there’s similar stage management at Labour’s event. Here in Bedworth, in Warwickshire, the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, is here to gee up his activists at this cafe. Like many events like this, a single main TV camera has been invited inside, but the pictures it films will be shared. And the Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg, has stopped off here in Solihull in the West Midlands for that staple of the election campaign trail- the photo opportunity. How things appear to have changed. Here was the then Labour Chancellor, jim Callaghan, in 1966. NEWS REEL: Everybody’s got the right in a democratic society like ours to ask a question and get it answered. Look atjohn Major, Prime Minister at the time, in 1992. The election is now in the hands, not of the commentators, but of the people. By 2001, Tony Blair was Prime Minister. So would you like to tell me what you’re going to do? This campaign has had informal events, although these are often crafted by party managers too. But imagine you were one of the leader’s spin doctors. In a super close election, wouldn’t you be a little careful about what your leader did? Chris Mason, BBC News, in Solihull. across the UK. Tonight, it’s Hannah Bacon, from Cheltenham, who’s recovering from a recent operation. My name is Hannah Bacon, I’m a single mum. I’m not working at the moment as I’ve been ill for a while. My daughter she has asthma. We’ve spent many a night in A&E, so I would like those things to still be there. It does feel like it’s getting privatised slowly, piece by piece. For her future it would be secondary education, the class sizes she’s going into, the class sizes she’s in now. And, as to, you know, if it’s changed into an Academy. You know, I have worked a lot of my life. As I’ve been ill, I’ve needed more help. I’d really like to be looking to go back into work now. Although it’s great that there’s lots of apprenticeships going on I do feel like that a lot of people will want a younger person rather than myself. Hannah Bacon, there from Cheltenham, with her thoughts on the election. Thank you to everyone whod in that series over the past few weeks. In a moment on BBC one time for the news where you are. On BBC Two a special edition of Newsnight coming from six key battlegrounds. We will be back tomorrow reporting on the final day of campaigning from the BBC election studio here. For now, thank you for watching, have a good night. Tonight on BBC London News: The final push for votes - we assess whether the Mayor has been the Tories so-called ‘secret weapon’ in the capital’s key seats. What they care about is what you’re doing, what you’re saying to the country and how you’re going to take it forward. That’s the issue for this country. Also tonight: the owners of a 1920s pub demolished without permission - are ordered to rebuild it, brick by brick. The struggle to get tonnes of aid collected here in the capital- to people in Nepal. Plus, the rise of the houseboat - and how it’s putting pressure on London’s waterways. Good evening - I’m Riz Lateef. Mayor Boris johnson joined up with David Cameron today for a final push to win over the capital’s voters for the Conservatives. Consistently rated as his party’s most popular politician, Mrjohnson has been touted as its main weapon in the fight for the capital’s 73 seats in Parliament. But Labour and the Liberal Democrats have dismissed the Boris effect saying local campaigning- by local candidates - has been more effective. Here’s our political correspondent Karl Mercer. With two days to go it’s getting to shouty time. What they care about is what you’re doing, what you’re saying to the country and how you’re going to take it forward. That’s the issue for this country. 10pm May the 7th, we don’t stop until 10pm. Half an hour break before the count. Keep them going. Thank you very much indeed. In the capital’s key battle grounds the last few rallies are being rallied, the last few pavements pounded. The start of the campaign seems a long time ago. What better to help the campaign get off to a cracking start than to welcome Borisjohnson, the Mayor of London? London’s mayor has been at the forefront of the Conservative battle. A man who has won two elections here deployed to boost Tory candidates in the closest of seats. It says no leaflets or promotional material, folks. I think we have to adhere. I think this counts as promotional material. He did post it anyway but seems to have posted much of the campaign not posting, but posing for selfies. just see a random special guy on the street and you just want a photo with him. You’re missing the opportunity. Are you going to vote Tory? God no. But does a selfie mean a vote? I hope so but I didn’t really have any time to ask anybody precisely what their postcode was. But does the Boris selfie phenomenon translate into votes for local Tory candidates or give the opposition the chance to go on the attack? Can I be perfectly brutal and frank about this. I think Borisjohnson is a very funny man. He’s one of the funniest people I’ve ever met and he’s got great hair. People want to have their photograph taken with a famous person. Lots of people would like their photograph taken with Kim Kardashian. I’m not sure if they would vote for her. Unless I specifically tell you otherwise, I’m in Croydon. The mayor has been, as they say, all over the place, recognised everywhere, even if the spelling sometimes isn’t up to the mark. I think it’s better like that! I think I might change it. I think Boris will have no effect. We all know that Boris is running to be the next Conservative Party leader, not really helping Mr Cameron. Really? So by the time he’s spent here, the time he spent on the marginals elsewhere in London are not going to make a difference? People are looking on the doorsteps which is the candidate which has campaigned hard for them and represented local people the best. How are you feeling? A lot better for seeing you. Nice to see you anyway. I won’t interrupt. Has this campaigning been for the benefit of the Conservatives or for the benefit of Boris johnson? Well, obviously we’ve got a very tough fight in lots of places in London and I’ve decided it’s best to be as useful as I possibly can. As I’m sure you know I’m simultaneously on the blower to City Hall the whole time, unless I specifically tell you otherwise, talking about stuff we are doing there. But things are proceeding in London at the same time. Battle grounds in outer London are very important. And those London battle grounds, the key marginals, good in the key marginals, could in the end be decisive in an election that is still too close to call. Karl Mercer, BBC London News. The owners of a 1920s pub - which was demolished without permission - have tonight been ordered to rebuild it brick by brick - in what Westminster City Council believes is the first action of its kind in the country. The Carlton Tavern in Maida Vale was bulldozed last month - while it was being considered for listed status. Alex Bushill reports. PROTESTERS: Brick by brick. Brick by brick. And so they will, campaigners and regulars of the Carlton Tavern were ecstatic tonight after the decision at City Hall to order developers to rebuild their pub brick by brick. A local community working-class pub that has served for generations. Many people enjoyed it, we want generations more to enjoy it. It’s just a pub where you felt at home, you could sit and talk about books in there, you could play the piano, you could just go there for a quiet drink or you could go for a completely mental night. So it was such a diverse place. It was a reflection of us as a community. This was the moment the Carlton Tavern was destroyed on the 8th of April last month in Maida Vale when the developers brought in the bulldozers. They had no permission to demolish. Infact, the pub was about to be recommended for Grade II listed status as a significant 1920s building. It’s thought these are the owners, filmed back on demolition day. Their previous application to level the pub and build a new one in its place, but crucially with flats and housing, had already been rejected by Westminster Council. A fact not lost on its councillors. It’s very important to our local community because it’s a place they have known all their lives. It was demolished by a Zeppelin in the First World War. It was rebuilt and now it’s been demolished again and I think it should rise like a Phoenix from the ashes, I really do. They want their pub back. The developers were not at tonight’s meeting but they will now be informed they have 18 months to rebuild the pub exactly as it was. Legal appeals could potentially frustrate that order but Westminster Council says there is no lack of political will to ensure Carlton Vale gets its Tavern back. Alex Bushill, BBC London News. An army recruitment sergeant has been found guilty of sex attacks on seven young female recruits at his office in Croydon. Southwark Crown Court heard that lI6-year-old Edwin Mee abused his power to ""bully and groom"" young female cadets. The jury found him not guilty of three offences and will keep on considering five other charges tomorrow. A former teacher at one of the country’s leading private schools has pleaded guilty to possessing and making thousands of indecent images of children. Anthony Fuggle, was a Classics master at Colet Court - the junior section of St Paul’s Prep School in Barnes. He’s the first person to be charged under the Met’s ‘Operation Winthorpe’ - which was set up to investigate allegations of abuse at the school. He’ll be sentenced next month. For days - the Nepalese community in Woolwich has been collecting for victims of the Nepal earthquake. Organisers in Woolwich have been overwhelmed with food, clothes and toys - some of which have already reached those affected. But they say they’re frustrated with the difficulties of trying to get all of the donations to those who desperately need it. As Ayshea Buksh reports. Thank you very much. The donations keep on coming and coming. From all over London people have brought clothes, food and emergency supplies to Woolwich Town Hall. The appeal went outjust after the earthquake struck from the Nepalese community in Greenwich. Two tonnes of aid has already reached villages near the earthquake’s epicentre. But there is still much more to go. The material we receive is very overwhelming. We can manage about two tonnes of stuff, which we negotiated with the airlines to ship it for free. Once we sent those two loads of items we don’t have any more space there. And while they wait for the airlines and cargo companies to fly out the remaining aid the eight or so tonnes of items left must be sorted by volunteers. When I try and pack I think I hope these things get there and send some positive vibes and hopefully when these things get there, these people find a bit of peace. When you see other human beings suffering this is the hurt you have. At the moment I’m doing nothing so I better do something here. And then this can be sent to the people. Over the weekend a vigil was held in Woolwich in honour of the earthquake victims. Greenwich Borough has one of the largest Nepalese communities in the UK. And while material aid is plentiful here, spiritual support is also not in short supply. At this temple in nearby Plumstead, prayers are being said daily. I hope it gives them peace, those who have departed, and those who have lost their families. At least they get some peace and I hope God will help them. And help us. And while the donations may keep arriving money is now needed to pay for this precious cargo to get to those in need. Ayshea Buksh, BBC London News, Greenwich. There’s a warning that the rise in the number of people living on houseboats - due to unaffordable property prices - is putting a strain on the the capital’s waterways. Some areas, like Hackney, have seen an 85% increase in the number of boats in the last year alone. Tarah Welsh has the story. Life on the water is slow, so it might surprise you that more and more Londoners are taking to the canals, or maybe it won’t. Well, basically because of house prices. You can’t tell from the way I dress now, but I used to work in the City in banking. I decided to go back to university and do something different. Ijust realised there was no way I’d be able to afford university and living in London as well. So then I bought a boat. Renting a one-bedroom flat here in Hackney costs about £350 a week. It doesn’t cost Peter much more than that to repay the loan on his boat for a month. Boat prices vary and to have one you need a licence, which usually costs a few hundred pounds every year. But you need to commit to moving your boat every couple of weeks, because permanent moorings are few and far between and they are auctioned off to the highest bidder. Infact, the last one that went in Islington was auctioned for £18,000 a year. And some people aren’t moving their boats like they are supposed to. The amount in Hackney has gone up by 85% in a year and the organisation that runs the waterways says that’s putting pressure on resources. Boating is a bit of a lifestyle choice. There are a lot of challenges involved in that, which may not be convenient if you have a fixed lifestyle, a job in a particular place, or you have children in school and so on. So we encourage people really to consider boating as a lifestyle, not as an easy choice for cheap accommodation. But affordable homes are hard to come by, so for many turning to the water has clearly been too tempting. Tarah Welsh, BBC London News. That’s it from me, so I’ll say goodnight. And leave you withjohn Hammond for a look at the weather. It was blustery today. It certainly was. We saw some serious damage, this was the scene in Tottenham. Thank you for sending that picture in. With similar gusts we could see similar impacts tomorrow. Watch out for the wind, it could be nasty through tomorrow. Another blustery day to come, otherwise there will be showers as well. So not really feeling like early May. Some wet weather further north but these clumps of cloud on the satellite picture are generating a few showers and overnight tonight they will bustle through on the breeze. The breeze is not a strong by night as it is by day, but it is a blustery night. One consolation is that with the air churned up it prevents temperatures from falling too low, not too cold, nine or 10 degrees first thing in the morning. Tomorrow will be another windy day and when the gusts get up to Ao mph or more, which they will do at times throughout the day, that’s when you start to season impacts, maybe the odd branch and fence panel down and the odd wheelie bin perhaps flying around. And there will be some sharp showers around but hopefully where you are you will see brighter spells. The outlook settles down for a bit but turns unsettled again for the weekend. Good evening. The month of April didn’t live up to its reputation of sharp showers, because we have seen very few. Infact, it’s been the sunniest April since records began backin sunniest April since records began back in 19 29th with over 200 hours of sunshine. But me is making up for it. We’ve seen sharp showers. This was Cardiff Bay this afternoon, beautiful rainbow but not pleasant in terms of the weather. We have seen strong to gale force winds bringing down trees in central London and a gust of wind in excess of 66 mph in Kahriman Bay. It looks as though the wimps will remain a feature overnight. We will see plenty of sharp showers driving in as well with some heavy persistent rain up into the North. Temperatures falling down to 6-9 but I’m not sure if that is going to be the talking point in the morning. It will be the strength of the wind and rain. Starting relatively dry and bright in eastern areas but a cluster of sharp showers and longer spells of rain will drive eastwards throughout the afternoon. And we still keep the rain fairly persistent up into the far north and west of Scotland along with the northern and Western Isles. So, here it will stay rather grey and cold with a north-westerly wind and highs of seven or 8 degrees. A little bit warmer across the borders, maybe around ten or11, warmer across the borders, maybe around ten or 11, similar story with a few showers into Northern Ireland. Frequent showers and strong blustery winds still the feature across England and Wales come at some of those showers starting to push into the East Midlands and across East Anglia and the south-east. Maybe just escaping the worst of those along the south coast, but the talking point again will be the strength of the winds. Unusual for this time of year, A5, 50 mph gusts not out of the question and maybe stronger than that on exposed coasts again. Eventually the low pressure will drift off into Scandinavia and the isobars open about things quieten down. I want to draw your attention to the area of low pressure in the Bay of Biscay, it could bring more of the unsettled weather at the weekend. Thursday looks quieter, polling day looks largely fine with some sunshine and isolated showers and lighter winds and it will feel better with highs of 17 Celsius. Moving into Friday the cloud increases but largely dry. There is the potential for more wet weather to come for the start of the weekend.

Here is the solution and it is not for the faint hearted so if you have a weak stomach, go and do something else for a few minutes because these are jellyfish hunting robots and when they find the jellyfish, they shred them. It is a serious enough problem for the Korean government to fund the project. The robots themselves behave like a swarm, one is the leader and the others follow information. The machines are fitted with cameras which guide them into position, netting the jellyfish and then doing debate you probably do not want to see so here it is. Yuck. OK, let’s dealwith not want to see so here it is. Yuck. OK, let’s deal with the Yuck. OK, let’s dealwith the main thing that is going through your mind right now. Is this cruel? I think it is not cruel because the jellyfish don’t have a brain and they are just jellyfish don’t have a brain and they arejust some they are just some kind of plankton, and we can’t shred them because they are just like the plant. -- because they are just like the plant. -- can. At the moment these are guided to the general area of the swarm byjellyfish detecting technology but soon they will have a real support as a drone flies over the sea and uses recognition to spot jellyfish swarms and instruct these GUYS jellyfish swarms and instruct these guys on where to go so the main thing can begin.-- mincing. guys on where to go so the main thing can begin. -- mincing. Leaving the Venice jelly smooth the in this he is not a good idea ecologically so this next group will catch the swarm in a cage and take them to shore where they will be used in cosmetics. It is a hard life being a jellyfish. I may well be in the minority but I love 3-D cinema so the experience without the glasses was something I had to experience. There are three screens in front of me, one to my left and went to my left and one in front for a total immersive experience -- left and one in front for a total immersive experience -- one. Invented at the visual media Lab, ScreenX is used to change how we see films by giving a films by giving small ScreenX is used to change how we see films by giving small number of relatively inexpensive projectors which can be installed in cinemas anywhere in the world. Turn the projectors off and the cinema can be used again for regular films. This technology has been around for a couple of years but there haven’t really been any full-length feature films screened. Most of the content has been commercials. Design reviews for this format has many challenges and expenses for the film crew. One challenge would be to use three different cameras to cover three sides, 270 degrees so it will give you some challenges because if you use only one camera to shoot a movie, things can hide behind the camera, whereas with a film camera coming when there are three there is nowhere to hide. The first full-length movie release for ScreenX will be later this month in Korea with plans to bring the screens to Europe in 2016 and possibly using the ceiling as well. And finally, back to Hubo who has made mince meat of the robotic challenge so far. We call a bulldozer mode. Fantastic. Now it is time for some brute force. The robot has to pick its way through this rubble field. It has bulldozer kneepads or feet. What is it going to do? I don’t know. This looks like a challenge because there was a lot of debris for it to bulldoze through. Now he has to go left and she’s pushing every thing to the right. OK, he survived. I’m nervous now. The last part of the test is to walk over some rough terrain and for this Hubo calls on his final, bizarre, form. But-- this Hubo calls on his final, bizarre, form. But -- boat walking? OK. This is the final part of the challenge, it needs to mount the podium. It is 80 kg, slightly heavier than me. podium. It is 80 kg, slightly heavierthan me. It heavier than me. It is doing it. The last step. Last step, Hubo! Oh! LAUGHIN6. You brought all the luck. All it needs now is an Arnold Schwarzenegger mask and we can all be satisfied at the rise of the machines happening. Ijust can’t believe it. Hubo has completed the course. It has taken 38 minutes, the team are aiming for 35 so on their last day of reversal, they are close. So I wish this team behind Hubo all the best of luck in the DARPA challenge, if this is the level we have got to with robotics, then, well, we are all in trouble. And that is it from Click in Korea for this week. We have another Korea special for you next week. In the meantime, we are at Twitter. Thank you so much were joining me on this adventure, it has been fantastic. We will see you next week. # GANGNAM STYLE #. Welcome to the weekend. Disappointingly cool for the time of year. We will all see rain at some stage but it is not a washout of a weekend. Certainly a chilly start to Saturday morning, even ground frost in some places but Saturday offers not just a fine start but fine and dry weather for many of us throughout the day. Not wall-to-wall sunshine, some of us will have rather cloudy skies and there will be one or two showers in northern Scotland but as the day goes on, we will see the odd shower in eastern areas of England and the Midlands. At 4:00pm there is a weather system approaching the south-west and south-west Wales and Northern Ireland and that comes in during the evening. At this stage most places are looking dry. There will be some sunny spells around and Northern Ireland, it is not warm but the sun makes all the difference. If you are out of the breeze and in the sun it is not too bad. Northern Scotland will see one or two showers, the rest of Scotland sees a decent amount of sunshine as does much of northern England. The odd shower reaching part of the Midlands at this stage in the afternoon but the rest of England and much of Wales is seeing a lot of cloud and 60 degrees in London. Two final games in the world of football, the sunniest weather will be in Scotland but both are looking dry and it is a dry start to the weekend action at the cricket at Headingley but on Sunday, it is a different story. Let’s find out why. As we end Saturday weather fronts are approaching so it will turn wet in the west over Saturday evening with a freshening wind and the UK through Headingley and for the rest of us as well. It would give many a wet and windy start to Sunday but bear with it because it will not wash out the whole day. It will get dry and eventually brighter although some may see a further shower. The rain will push away east on Sunday morning and eastern Scotland and England will keep it going into the afternoon. Following behind, it will brighten up slowly with a few showers in northern and western areas in particular. Monday and Tuesday does not look like spring or summer, it is more like autumn with this area of low pressure promising more rain and strong winds or gales but as we go through next week, the weather transforms from that very autumnal looking field at the start of the week to something more settled and eventually more summerlike at the end of the week. Welcome to BBC News, broadcasting to viewers on public television in the US and around the globe. I’m Gavin Grey. Our top stories: Sepp Blatter is re-elected as president of Fifa despite the charges of corruption against some of his officials. As thousands of Asian migrants continue their desperate journey, we have a special report from the Thai-Malaysia border. No escaping justice on the dark web: The founder of a site setup to sell illegal drugs is sentenced to life in prison. And, another step in the thaw in relations: The US removes Cuba from its list of state sponsors of terrorism. Sepp Blatter has been re-elected president of Fifa, despite being at the helm during one of the biggest corruption scandals to rock world football. Mr Blatter secured another four years after his only rival, Prince Ali bin al-Hussein ofjordan, withdrew, though he won enough support to force a second round of voting. Football’s world governing body has become the subject of two criminal investigations in Switzerland and the US amid accusations of rampant corruption. In his acceptance speech in Zurich, Mr Blatter said he took full responsibility for restoring Fifa’s reputation. Our Sports Editor Dan Roan has more. Somehow he had done it again. At the end of the most turbulent week in Fifa’s history, Sepp Blatter tonight able to celebrate clinging to power. The 79-year-old living up to his reputation as sport’s great survivor having extended his scandal-hit regime into a fifth term. I thank you, I thank you that you accepted me, that for the next four years I will be in command of this boat called Fifa and we will bring it back. We will bring it back off shore. Earlier, Blatter’s challenger, Prince Ali ofjordan, arrived, hoping he could pull off one of the sport’s biggest ever results. Inside an early sign of the rancour that surrounds. Security, please. Protesters disrupting proceedings. Wednesday’s arrest of football officials plunging it into turmoil. Ali now vowing to restore the organisation’s battered reputation. We have heard questions raised about whether our family is morally bankrupt. If you give me the honour of your votes I will take full responsibility and hold myself accountable to all of you and to the world. Blatter meanwhile, pleading with his supporters in Africa and Asia for another chance. I would quite simply like to stay with you. I would like to stay with you. I would like to continue with you. With that, it was time for Fifa to decide. Eight delegate casting a vote in turn. Blatter polled 133 votes to 73. That was close enough to trigger a second round. But Ali withdrew. Blatter had prevailed, although opposition remains. This isn’t over by any means. The events of this week are so traumatic for Fifa that I cannot see Fifa reforming itself under Blatter. He has had 16 years to reform it. He hasn’t done it. The events of this week are so profound. If you listen to what the Attorney General in America said, this is the beginning and not the end. I think there is an awful lot more for this to play out. But for now, having weathered the storm, Blatter was left to bask in the glory of victory. The scandal he has survived, however, is set to linger on. The founder of the Silk Road website, Ross Ulbricht has been sentenced to life in prison in the United States. Dealers used the site to trade more than $200 million worth of drugs anonymously using the virtual currency Bitcoin. Our correspondent in New York, Nick Bryant, gave my colleague Ben Bland more details about Mr Ulbricht’s illegal activities. He was the kingpin of a digital drugs empire. It was called the Silk Road website, and it operated in the darker reaches of the Web, and supposedly offered untraceable drug deals. He was the kind of middle man, where people wanted to buying drugs -- man, where people wanted to buying drugs -- wanting to buy drugs, would make a commitment to sell drugs, and he would take a commission. It was found he had taken over $18 million in commissions through the site. He used the online alias, Dread Pirate Roberts, which was from the film the Princess Bright. As you see, we As yOU SEE, WE i’I8Vâ SOITIE As you see, we have some breaking news. The US defence Secretary, Ashton Carter, hasjust news. The US defence Secretary, Ashton Carter, has just started to talk at a conference in Asia. He is addressing this major meeting of defence security officials, about the tension in the South China Sea. Thank you for that kind of-- kind introduction. Thank you for sponsoring this remarkable forum. Overrich history, the organisation has posted vital conversation, and through all that you have made our world more secure. On behalf of the US, thank you. One reason I have enjoyed coming to this dialogue since attending it for the first time is the opportunity to visit with so many good friends the U -- the United States has. On my way to South East Asia, I attended a change of command ceremony, in Hawaii, and I met with the national defence secretary of the Philippines. When I arrived in Singapore I had the opportunity to visit with PM Lee, who gave a characteristically wise and incisive keynote speech last week. They were talking about regional challenges and a deepening defence relationship. Of course, I see so many friends here today, and I will meet with many of you. From Singapore I will travel to Vietnam with several visits, where the Defence Minister and I will sign a joint vision statement for greater operational cooperation. The first time that the US and Vietnam commit to do so. Then I will fly on to India to tour the Eastern Naval command and meet with my counterpart in New Delhi to sign the new US/India resolution, which will lay out the cooperation between us for the next decade. Each of these stops is a reminder of the regional demand for persistent American engagement, and the importance of the regional security architecture that has helped so many Asia-Pacific nations to rise and prosper. That is the theme of my remarks today. The US wants a shared regional architecture thatis wants a shared regional architecture that is strong enough, capable enough and connect it enough to ensure that all individuals, peoples and nations have the opportunity to rise and continue to rise in the future. -- rise and continue to rise in the future. -- connected. The US wants a future where an Indonesian fishermen, and energy executive from Malaysia, an entrepreneurfrom Malaysia, an entrepreneur from Singapore, Malaysia, an entrepreneurfrom Singapore, a farmerfrom California, a Chinese businesswoman, just to name a few, have the security and opportunity to rise and prosper. The US wants to opportunity to rise and prosper. The US wa nts to protect US wants to protect the rights of all countries, whether large or small, to win, to rise, to prosper and to determine their own destiny. To realise that future, the Asia-Pacific security architecture must be inclusive, it must be open, it must the transparent. And it must respect rights and notjust might. It cannot shy away from hard issues, it must provide a forum to openly discuss the challenges we face so we can tackle them collectively. It must be action oriented, to help us manage today’s challenges and event tomorrow’s crises. And it must reward cooperation, not coercion. That is an ordination idea, -- audacious idea, but we meet today to demonstrate what consistency and persistence can do, though we do so with heavy heart. Lee Kuan Yew once said, ""anyone who thinks he is a statesman meets to see a psychiatrist. But the world lost a great friend and indeed one of its premier statesman with his passing earlier this year. Lee Kuan Yew’s spirit of statesmanship endures, perhaps nowhere more than in this room. Here, men and women of good will come together and think critically about the region’s future. We owe it to Lee Kuan Yew, who described his leadership style as "" are set out to do something, I keep on chasing it until it succeeds"". We owe it to all those we represent, organisations, businesses and represent, organisations, businesses and individuals, to work together until we succeed, until every nation can rise and everybody wins. That is the future we all need to keep chasing. We succeeded before, over the past 70 years, the Asia-Pacific has grown and prospered in so many ways. Miracle after miracle has occurred. Firstjapan, then Taiwan, South Korea, South East Asia, including Singapore, rose and prospered. Now China and India are rising and prospering. And the region is not done yet. Today, over 60% of the world’s population lives in the Asia-Pacific. It is the fulcrum of the global economy, one of the fastest growing regions of the world. That sustained growth, supported by increased regional and international trade, has lifted millions out of poverty and into the middle class. Even though there is still room for improvement, democracy and freedom have spread throughout the region. Meanwhile, the US is doing well too. Following their worst recession since the great depression, the US economy has made great gains in bothjobs and GDP. Progress will continue because of America’s dynamic and innovative businesses, and strong commitment to the rule of law. World-class universities, and the domestic energy revolution now under way. The US military, long the finest fighting force the world has ever known, has improved its readiness while maintaining its unmatched operational edge and unrivalled capabilities. America’s so-called rebalance has always been about sustaining the progress occurring all around the Asia-Pacific and helping the region continue to fulfil its promise. As Secretary of Defence, I am fulfil its promise. As Secretary of Defence, Iam personally Defence, I am personally committed to its next phase, in which DOD will continue long-standing relationships, diversify America’s posture, and make new platforms and capabilities. The department is investing in the technologies that are most relevant to the complex security environment, such as new unmanned systems for the air and sea. A new long-range bomber, and new technologies like the electromagnetic rail gun, lasers and new systems for space and cyberspace, including a few surprising ones. As the US develops new systems, DOD will continue to bring the breast platforms and people forward to the Asia-Pacific -- best platforms. Such is the latest submarines, the Navy’s Poseidon aircraft, the Navy’s new destroyer, and the new early warning and control aircraft. The rebalance’s next phase is more about just security. The US is increasing economic and diplomatic engagement. The Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, orTPP, The Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, or TPP, just past a milestone in the U.S. Congress, and when it is completed it will unlock tremendous economic opportunities, not only for the US but for countries across the Pacific rim. It will create a do diverse area driven by TPP’s diverse subjects. Secretary Kerry and other members of the cabinet are making frequent visits to the region. President Obama will meet a number of Asian leaders at the White House before travelling here again in November. The entire Obama administration, and many others in Washington, both Republican and Democrat, are devoted to rebalance. The rebalance involves strong bipartisan support in Congress, as you can see from the large and distinguished congressional delegation joining me here today. Senator McCain, Senator Reid, Senator Hirano, Senator Gardner, Senator Sullivan, have been and will continue to be leaders in this important national effort. That is because full decade upon decade, regardless of what else was going on at home or in other parts of the world, during Democratic and Republican presidencies, in a time of surplus and deficit, war and peace, the US has stood with its allies and partners here and help maintain peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific. In the US always will. It is important to remember that our rebalance and a strategy to fix the architecture where everyone rises has never aimed to hold any nation back or push any country down. The United States wants every nation to have an opportunity to rise and prosper and we in because it is good for the region and good for all of our countries. -- for the region and good for all of our countries. -- win. As countries across the Asia-Pacific rise, as nations develop, military spending increases and economies thrive we expect to see changes in how countries defined and pursue their interests and ambitions. In addition to those changes, we have seen the region’s complex security environment become more fraught, North Korea continues to provoke. Decades long disputes over rocks and shawls are compounded by quarrels over fishing rights, energy resources and freedom of access to international waters and airspace. -- shoals. As the challenge of climate change looms larger, national disasters, not only threaten lives, but also upsets trade and economic growth. And at the same time, terrorism, foreign fighters, cyber attacks and trafficking in both people and narcotics plague this region like any other. These challenges risk upsetting the positive trajectory we have all been on. And the rise of so many in the Asia-Pacific. That can make it hard to remember our common interests, but the progress we have made must continue, it demands we do so. Unlike elsewhere in the world, the peace in the Asia-Pacific has never been maintained by a regionwide alliance, like Nato in Europe. And that made sense for the Asia-Pacific, with its unique history, geography, and politics. Instead, regional peace, stability and security here have required all of our nations coming together behind shared interests. We must continue to come together. Today and in the years ahead, security must be the shared responsibility of all of us, all our nations, with the strength in the East Asia Summit we have the foundation for a stronger architecture. It is incumbent upon all of us to make it better, by rear forming our long-standing rules and norms, strengthening institutions, modernising alliances, enhancing capabilities and improving productivity. -- capabilities and improving productivity. -- reaffirming. As President Obama said in Brisbane last year, it must be based, not on spheres of influence, or coercion, or intimidation, were big nations bully the small, but on alliances were international security and law and security and the peaceful resolution of disputes. First, we must all reaffirm the guiding principles and the rules that have served this region so well. Disputes should be resolved peacefully, through diplomacy, not aggression or intimidation. All countries should have the freedom of navigation and overflight so global commerce can continue unimpeded. And all nations should be able to make their own security and economic choices free from coercion. These are the rights of all nations, not obstructions, and they are not subject to the whims of any one country. They are not privileges to be granted or withdrawn by any country. These rules make sense, they have worked and they can continue to help all our nations to rise, so long as we reinforce them instead of putting them at risk. Second, we must strengthen regional institutions, the nations of ASEAN have laid the foundation for the security in Southeast Asia we have seen today and they will continue to be central to it. That is why the US and the Department of Defence are making an affirmative investment of time, resources and engagement in ASEAN. That is why America has committed to sending a new US defence adviser to augment the US mission to ASEAN in order to improve co-ordination and information sharing for the humanitarian and disaster response and Maritime Security. That is also why I plan to travel to Malaysia in November for this year’s ADMM Plus meeting. As ASEAN continues to build security in years ahead, we continue these communities to seek out new ways to work together and pull resources to maintain regional security. -- resources to maintain regional security. -- pool. Third, America boss to alliances and partnerships have in the bedrock of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific for decades. --'s. We are working with allies like Australia, japan, the Republic of Korea, Thailand and the Philippines to be sure all our alliances continue to serve this vital function. alliances continue to serve this vitalfunction. Modernisation vital function. Modernisation means changing these alliances to address the evolving threat environment as the US has done with South Korea. Growing those alliances into platforms for regional and international cooperation, as we have done with Australia and japan. Under Prime Minister Abe, japan is increasing its engagement in Southeast Asia. Through the recently updated guidelines for the US-japan defence cooperation, the United States and japan will be able to do more as an alliance in the region and beyond. Forward stationing America’s most advanced capabilities injapan, like the global surveillance drone, Ristic missile defence destroyers and the recently announced CV22 osprey will allow further rapid responses to regional contingencies. -- further rapid responses to regional contingencies. -- ballistics. Meanwhile, the US-Korea alliance not only ensures stability on the Korean peninsula, it increasingly works for the region as well. And in Australia, US and Australian forces now train side-by-side, not only with each other, as they have for many years, but also with friends and partners across Southeast Asia. Beyond alliances, the United States is also deepening its partnerships with friends across the region, including India and Vietnam, where as I said, I will travel next week. The United States is looking for new ways to compliment India’s Act East policy. The 2015 US-India defence framework I will sign next week will open up this relation on anything from maritime security to aircraft carrier and jet from maritime security to aircraft carrierandjet engine carrier and jet engine technology Corporation. We are leveraging these relationships to perform new pursuits of Corporation. That is why these networks are blossoming also. -- cooperation. Withjapan and Australia, the United States is strengthening maritime security in Southeast Asia, expanding trilateral exercises, exploring defence technology exercises, exploring defence technology Corporation. With japan in Korea, the United States is building on the first of its kind information sharing arrangement that will help them collectively deter and respond to crises. Withjapan and India, the United States is sharing lessons learned on disaster responses and building greater maritime security cooperation. Fourth, in addition to strengthening relationships, we must enhance the capacities of the regional security architecture, particularly on maritime security. American men and women in uniform working together with countries in the region to build that capacity, especially on maritime security, for example, the USS Ft. Worth, one of the navy’s nimble combat ships, just returned from a regional tour where it was welcomed everywhere from South Korea to Southeast Asia. And Singapore’s willingness to host ships like Ft. Worth helps all of us respond more quickly and effectively to regional crises, for example, when AirAsia flight... We will leave it there, Ashton Carter, giving his speech at the age security summit. In that speech, of defence and security officials, he said America wants Asian countries to rise and prosperous. But they would need to share regional architecture. prosperous. But they would need to share regionalarchitecture. It share regional architecture. It also said that regional peace in Asia and the lies in countries coming together, and then in a thinly veiled threat about the building of artificial islands in South China’s sees, he said big nations should not all be small nations. We will be back with the headlines shortly. -- Seas. -- will be. Disappointingly cool on the weekend. We will all see rain at some stage. Not a washout of a weekend. A chilly start to Saturday morning, even a rural ground frost in places, but Saturday offers not just a fine start, but fine and dry weather for most of us throughout the day. Not wall-to-wall sunshine. Some of us will have cloudy sky. One or two showers in northern Scotland. As the day goes on we might see eastern areas of England having reigned. -- Scotland. A weather system is approaching the south-west and south-west Wales and Northern Ireland. That comes in during the evening. At this stage, lipm, most places are looking dry. Sunny spells around in Northern Ireland. Not warm. But the sun makes all the difference. It is not too bad, even in the breeze. Northern Scotland will have some showers, the rest of Scotland sees a decent amount of sunshine appeared as does much of northern England. The odd shower reaching parts of the Midlands and eastern England again. But at this stage of the afternoon, the rest of England and much of Wales will see a lot of cloud. 60 degrees off. Queue World Cup games. The sunniest weather will be in Scotland. Both are looking dry. -- weather will be in Scotland. Both are looking dry. -- two. Dry for cricket. However, Sunday is a different story. That is because, as we and Saturday, fronts are approaching, it will turn wetter in the West. During Saturday evening a freshening wind. Then the rain will push across the UK through Headingley. Giving us a wet and windy start for Sunday. Better with it. It is not washing up the whole day because it will get dry and bright, though you may see a further shower. That rain may push eastwards during Sunday morning. North-east Scotland and eastern parts of England. Following on behind, eventually, a slow process, it will brighten up. A few showers following to north and western areas. Monday and Tuesday, this does not look like spring, it is more like Autumn with this area of low pressure promising more showers. But as we go through next week, the weather transforms from a very autumnal looking feel at the start of the week, something more settled, and eventually more Summer like at the end of the week. The latest headlines from BBC News. I’m Gavin Grey. Sepp Blatter has been re-elected president of football’s world governing body, Fifa, for a fifth term, despite separate US and Swiss criminal investigations into alleged Fifa corruption. Mr Blatter secured his tenure for another four years after his only rival withdrew after the first round of voting. The BBC has heard further allegations of the torture, rape and murder of Rohingya migrants from Myanmar. A BBC correspondent, who travelled to a camp formerly used by people traffickers in Malaysia, said people spoke of being detained, beaten, tortured and raped. Some were taken and never returned. The German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, has said she wants to play a constructive role as David Cameron tried to renegotiate Britain’s relationship with the EU. She also left open the possibility that reforms could mean changes made to the treaty is that underpin the EU. -- the treaties. Some children’s fruits snacks, labelled as healthy, contain more sugar than sweets, according to a new study. Some have the equivalent of four spoonfuls of sugar. Our health correspondent, Dominic Hughes, reports. A healthy diet helps children get a good start in life, but making sure they eat lots of fruit and veg is not always easy. So fruit snacks, often coated in yoghurt, can be a handy answer but do parents know howjust much sugar they contain? I do buy them because they’ve got fruit in them, so I think it’s a good idea. Are you aware of how much sugar they contain? Perhaps we should look a bit more closely maybe. They’ve all got pictures of fruit on them, so you think you’re doing a good thing by picking those off the shelf instead. Some do have added sugar to them and some don’t, so there’s no way of...it’s really hard. You have to read the small print to find out which are the good ones and which are, you know, not so good. And do you like them? You do! And experts warn the sugar in these snacks is different to that which occurs naturally in fresh fruit. As soon as it’s starting to be processed, you’re losing both an awful lot of the nutrients within it as well, but sometimes you consume much larger quantities in much more concentration than you expect to. Researchers looked at 94 fruit snack products on sale in the UK. They found that 85% of them contain more sugar than sweets. Some had more than four teaspoons per portion. And 99% of the snacks would receive a red colour-coded warning on the label for high sugar content. So researchers say that a child that ate two of these fruit snacks would have to work their way through this entire packet of strawberries in order to consume the same amount of sugar. But the manufacturers say information on nutrition and sugar is clearly marked on these packets, and it’s up to parents to decide what they feed their kids. The sugar content is very clearly displayed on the pack in the nutrition table and this empowers consumers to make informed choices for them and for their children. Health campaigners say parents already find it hard enough to work out what’s healthy for their kids and the packaging and content of these fruit snacks doesn’t help. Those are the headlines. Now on BBC News, it’s time for Witness. Hello and welcome to Witness at the British Library in London. I am here to introduce you to five more people who have witnessed a moment in history first-hand. This month, we will hear from a man who was taken hostage as a child. The mother who gave birth to India’s million baby. And a woman who survived an airport massacre in Israel. But first, this year marks the 70th anniversary of victory in Europe day. Millions of people packed the streets of London in a historic move to celebrate the end of the war in Europe. Dorothy Hughes was serving in the British forces at the time and travel to central London tojoin in. The crowd was so cosmopolitan. The number of nationalities of soldiers in uniform, I have never seen so many. Itjust uniform, I have never seen so many. It just was a uniform, I have never seen so many. Itjust was a day like none other. On VE Day we were working in Richmond Park with army operational research group, and a group of us decided to come into London and to just see what was going on. He eventually got to the West End -- just see what was going on. He eventually got to the West End -- we eventually got the West End and decided to up Whitehall. Everyone started shouting, we want Churchill, we want Churchill! He eventually came onto the balcony, waved to us, and called out"" it is not my day, it is your day"". We then decided we would like to walk up to Buckingham Palace. We got behind an open car and it stopped and Churchill was standing at the back, and he had his B sign, and he also said to us, good on you boys. He had his weeks ago, but it wasn’t lit. -- on you boys. He had his weeks ago, but it wasn’t lit. -- V sign. We were euphoric that the war had finished. I got to London late in 191+1, when I was 18. I enlisted and there were guns on every piece of grass you could imagine. Ourjob was really to fight off the bombers. There were 90,000 bombs dropped, and there were thousands of people killed. To be able to walk around in the street without hearing a noise overhead all the busting and whistle of bombs, and not being reigned with shrapnel, it was unbelievable. We were singing all sorts of songs, like, Doing The Lambeth Walk, and it got you in a long line with your arms around each other. We got involved with an American group of about Yanks and they invited us back to their canteen that they had in Piccadilly, and we were very hungry. To eat pineapple and peaches and bananas, we have -- To eat pineapple and peaches and bananas, we have -- had never seen bananas, it was fantastic. We went down to Trafalgar Square and it was chaotic. Everyone dancing in the fountain, who could get in. We had had five years of complete and utter darkness, and then to see lights coming on in buildings, and the buses had their headlamps on. To see some of the adverts come on in Piccadilly, and they had been out for all the time. We realised we were getting back to normal and it was a wonderful feeling. Dorothy Hughes, the first ever female Chelsea pensioner. In 1977, armed Indonesian separatist stormed a primer School in Holland and took 105 children hostage. Over the next four days, the men gave the Dutch government a series of demands. Our next guest wasjust government a series of demands. Our next guest was just nine years old when he was caught up in the crisis. It was the place where everything happen. -- It was the place where everything happen. -- happened. My school used to be here, but after the hijacking the school was pulled down. There was too much happened here. The first time I saw children playing again in this place, I had tears in my eyes. Really. I was going like a child to school, happy and free like a child. I came out completely changed. That ordeal started on Monday morning, soon after pupils at the school settled down to their lessons. The terrorists rushed in and herded pupils and teachers together at gunpoint. There was a lot of crying of the children, but immediately they said "" quiet!The threats were so high that you The threats were so high that you acquired. Of the hijackers, the youngest was 18 and the oldest was 23. The leader of the hijacking had hand grenades and pistols. He was carrying heavy weapons. To the liberal Dutch, the scion of armed soldiers on their streets is something alien. The Dutch have done much to ease the South blackens, but an independent Malacca is not something for them to bestow. We were told, if you don’t do what we say we will blow up the school with every child in it. They said that to the government. It was two hours before the deadline set by the gunmen that the children appeared at the window and started charging, let us live. You are sitting there, and you are thinking, I will never go home, I will never see my brother and sister, my father and mother, again. Never. After three and a half days, some of the children had problems with their stomachs. The teacher said to the hijackers, this is not going well, it is not going good. By dawn it was possible to see a parting in the school curtains, and at 6:35am the site everyone had waited for. The first small figures, draped in brown blankets, emerged from the school and walk to the bus. -- walked. I didn’t speakfor 20 years about what happened to me, to nobody. In 2007 I met one of the hijackers personally, and I talked with him. He was asking for forgiveness for what he has done. He is a hijacker, I am a victim, but I don’t hate him and we have something to tell. We have to live together, not fight each other but live together. And love each other. It doesn’t matter what is between you, but talk about it. Don’t do stupid things, talk about it. A truly remarkable story of forgiveness. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, thousands of Cubans forced their way into foreign embassies in Havana to seek vertical asylum. The Cuban President said that anyone wanting to leave Cuba should board boats bound for the US. This man was one of those who left during that boatlift. I believed in the revolution, I was a good student. Things began to change when I was in fifth grade. I teachers would make fun of me because I said I believed in God. They were extremely cruel to me and my family. My uncle and my aunt in the US visited Cuba in 1979, and through then I understood that I had been fed many lies, not only about the Cuban revolution but also about life in the US. They were doing well, certainly better than we were. It led to my rejection of the revolution. In April of 1980, an unemployed bus driver rammed the bus against the gate of the Peruvian embassy in Havana. That led to thousands of people rushing to the embassy to ask for political asylum. Shortly after that, there was a very small item in the newspaper saying that because of this, Cubans were coming from the US in boats, and everyone who wanted to could come to the US with their relatives. My father immediately, waving the newspaper, told my mother, this is it. President Castro has been seen to encourage as large an exodus as possible from his country. President Castro wants to get rid of people who oppose his ideas. The first few days were very tense. The Cuban government had organised acts of... People were harassing the neighbours simply because they wanted to leave Cuba. There was a knock on the door, and it was the police. They told us we needed to be ready in ten minutes to go. Our neighbour, the president of the watchdog committee, came upstairs with the police officers. The police asked her to do one of those, to organise one of these acts of repudiation for us. She said, nobody touches these girls. It is now a huge and open-ended migration, with hundreds of Cubans thanking the crossing daily. The seal it is a mixture of Cubans and Americans. Many are risking their lives boats in the gratitude shows through. It was incredibly hard, once we were off the water. We felt stateless. The police took the ID cards of my parents and a little money we had, 200 key -- parents and a little money we had, 200 key -- pesos was all we had. The boatjourney 200 key -- pesos was all we had. The boat journey was extremely difficult. I rememberthe boat journey was extremely difficult. I remember the moment I difficult. I remember the moment! stepped off the boat, my seasickness evaporated. On the one hand I was very happy to be leaving, but at the same time I was sad. I lost my country, and that is a wound that! carry with me and I will always carry with me.

Government officials decided the baby girl born on the 11th of May in a hospital in Delhi would symbolically marks the milestone. Astha Arora was that baby and her mother, Anjana, spoke to Witness. TRANSLATION: I had no idea what was happening. Here we were talking about overpopulation... I just felt, oh my god, where am I? We are ordinary people, we don’t own much.

In those days, the place where people stood to meet passengers who had arrived was separated by these huge panes of glass. This banging noise started and suddenly these huge panes of glass shattered, they came cascading down, and I rememberthinking, this looksjust down, and I rememberthinking, this looks just like looksjust like rain. People started dropping to the floor. And there was blood everywhere. And then I turned to run, and as I turned, this huge hole appeared in the back of my thigh. And I realised that! hole appeared in the back of my thigh. And I realised that I had been shot. And I ran and I heed under a seat. And it is impossible to convey the utter terror when you think you are going to lose a life. -- hid. And I sawa picture think you are going to lose a life. -- hid. And I saw a picture of my house in London, and my family, and I wasjust waiting house in London, and my family, and I was just waiting for the next bullet to hit me because I was convinced that it would kill me. And thenit convinced that it would kill me. And then it stopped. There was an eerie quiet. And I stood up to see this... The stuff of nightmares, really. The man next to me was dead. His hat was resting on his wife was marked lap. Ifelt, she was thinking, if you were standing here, you would want to take his place. -- his head. Ifound out on the following day that the terrorists were three japanese working for the Palestinians and they had killed 26 people and injured more than 70. We were driven to a hospital, there were dozens and dozens of people there. Ifound myself next were dozens and dozens of people there. I found myself next to a Puerto Rican women who was clearly pregnant. She kept asking, where her husband was, and the doctors around her bedside were saying to each other, Hilmet, it means, he’s dead, in Hebrew. She turned to me and said, you know, they cannot find my husband, do you think he is all right? So I lied and I said, I was sure that very soon she would know what had happened. I thought, sure that very soon she would know what had happened. Ithought, I what had happened. I thought, I am only 23 years old... And I am caught UP only 23 years old... And I am caught up in this nightmare. How will! ever get over this? I left Israel the following year because I found it very difficult to stay there. I wanted to come home. I often go in the garden and say to myself, this is a good to be a live day, I don’t think! is a good to be a live day, I don’t think I would have done that if I had not experienced what I did in Israel. -- alive. I have tremendous empathy for all these people caught UP empathy for all these people caught up in these terrible incidents. And I often write them letters to say it is oK. Life does go on, you are different, but, it will be oK. And thatis different, but, it will be oK. And that is all from us this month. Next month, we will be back at the British library with another five witnesses and more history through the eyes of people who were there. Bye for now, from me and from the rest of the team at Witness goodbye. -- at for now. Welcome to the weekend. Disappointingly cool for the time of year. We will all see rain at some stage. It is not a washout of a weekend. It is certainly a chilly start to Saturday morning. Even rural ground frost in places. Saturday offers not just a fine start but fine dry weather for many of us throughout the day. Not wall-to-wall sunshine. Some of us will have rather cloudy skies. There will be some showers in northern Scotland. Is the day goes on we might see the odd shower for parts of the East Midlands and eastern areas of England. We will take a look at things four o’clock in the afternoon. Weather system approaching the south-west, Wales and Ireland, it comes injuring the evening. At this stage, most places are looking dry. -- during. It will not be warm, but the sun makes the difference. It is not too bad, even in the breeze. Northern Scotland will see one or two showers.

Two cup final gains in the world of football, the sunniest weather will be in Scotland, but both are looking dry. -- games. And it is a dry start to the weekend, action in the cricket at Headingley, however Sunday is a different story. Let’s find out why. As we end Saturday, fronts approaching, it will turn wet in the West during Saturday evening with a freshening wind in the rain is pushing east across the UK through Headingley and for the rest of us as well. Giving many of us a wet and windy start to Saturday. Bear with it, it is not washing up the whole day because it will get drier and eventually brighter. You may see a shower. It will push eastward. Following behind, eventually, a slow process, a few showers following two northern and western areas. Monday and Tuesday, this does not look like spring or Summer, it is more like Autumn with the area of low pressure promising more rain or the showers, strong winds or Gaels but then as we go through the next week at the weather transforms from and autumnal look and feel at the start of the week, something more settled and eventually more Summer like at the end of the week. -- gales. The United States has called for an immediate and lasting halt to reclamation works by all claimants in disputed waters in the South China Sea. Speaking in Singapore a short time ago, the US Defence Secretary Ashton Carter told China that its behaviour in the area was out of step with international norms and rules. Bill Hayton reports. Out in the middle of the South China Sea, China is creating land. It is turning nine coral reefs into naval bases. Two of them will have major runways. In their natural state, most of these features would be under water, which means they don’t count as territory under international law, so the US has begun operations to challenge China’s claims, flying planes close to the new bases. The American defence secretary has called on China to stop what it is doing. There should be an immediate and lasting halt to land reclamation by all claimants. We also oppose any further militarisation of disputed features. He also made clear the US will push back attempts to prevent its ships and planes using the sea. There should be no mistake. The US will fly, sale and operate wherever international law allows, as US forces do all over the world. Those policies have already provoked criticism from Beijing. TRANSLATION: We urge the US, which is not a party to the South China Sea dispute, to take a responsible attitude. Be prudent in words and deeds, be reasonable and calm, and stop making provocative remarks. Other countries around the South China Sea are stepping up their cooperation in the face of China’s moves. Earlier this week Vietnamese and Philippines troops took part in joint sporting activities. A piece of fun but with a serious purpose. They seem determined to stand their ground, but the clashes at the moment will be limited to the ballroom. Sepp Blatter has been re-elected president of Fifa, despite being at the helm during one of the biggest corruption scandals to rock world football. Mr Blatter secured another four years after his only rival, Prince Ali bin al-Hussein ofjordan, withdrew, though he won enough support to force a second round of voting. Football’s world governing body has become the subject of two criminal investigations in Switzerland and the US amid accusations of rampant corruption. In his acceptance speech in Zurich, Mr Blatter said he took full responsibility for restoring Fifa’s reputation. Our Sports Editor Dan Roan has more. Tonight there is talk of the nuclear option, a vote of no-confidence, an general meeting. There is special pressure from high profile national sponsors who want immediate action from Fifa. There is bound to be more controversy over the way Fatah treats migrant workers. So severe was this issue, it was seen as a rebuke from the developing world to the West. -- rebuke from the developing world to the West. ÂÂ Qatar.

Ross Ulbricht was found guilty of drug trafficking, engaging in a criminal enterprise and money laundering in February. Silk Road carried out more than $200 million worth of illegal transactions. The US military says it has discovered even more suspected cases of accidental shipments of live anthrax than previously thought, both in the United States and abroad. The Pentagon said 21+ labs in 11 US states and two other countries were believed to have received live anthrax samples. The Defence Department has ordered a review of all its US labs. The United States’ Government has removed Cuba from its list of state sponsors of terrorism. The move removes a key obstacle to restoring diplomatic ties between the old enemies.

David Cameron’s received a boost to his plans for EU reform during a meeting with Angela Merkel in Berlin. The German Chancellor said she wasn’t ruling out changes to existing European treaties. But there was a less positive response in Poland about Mr Cameron’s idea to curb migrants’ rights to welfare. Our deputy political editor, james Landale, reports. In Berlin today they pulled out all the stops. Guards of honour, yards of red carpet, and a warm hug and a kiss. He doesn’t get this everywhere. But this was not just a display of German respect for a newly elected PM, it was also the continent’s most powerful politician extending the hand of friendship towards a leader she wants in lockstep, not just with her, but also the rest of Europe. So, after a quick lunch, Chancellor Merkeljoined David Cameron before the cameras and suggested she could do a deal with her guest over his plans to reform the European Union. TRANSLATION: We want to work closely together in the process that the UK is now going through towards a referendum. We would like to help in a constructive way. As I’ve said before, where there’s a will, there’s a way. And that’s quite something to say when Mr Cameron wants to cut migrants’ benefits, opt Britain out of ever closer union and give national parliaments new powers to block EU laws. What chance do you believe that David Cameron has in achieving his reforms, given the opposition that you and so many other leaders have towards the treaty changes that he’s seeking? TRANSLATION: If you are convinced of an idea, you can’t say that treaty change is an absolute impossibility. To a PM who has been told no so often, this, perhaps, WGS VâI’y WâlCO!T!â. I was very heartened by what the Chancellor said in terms of where there’s a will, there’s a way. If content requires changes in treaties, then you can’t let that stand in the way of what needs to be done. What Europe needs to be, it needs to have the flexibility of a network, not the rigidity of a bloc. Earlier, the mood in Poland was less positive. Mr Cameron and the Polish PM agreed the EU needed to be more competitive. But she told him of her strong disagreement with any benefit cuts that might discriminate against Polish nationals in Britain. If we are talking about imposing certain solutions that are going to divide European citizens, and some of the proposals could be read in this way, then obviously we would be against. David Cameron’s aim on this grand tour of Europe is to make sure that when the negotiations begin in earnest at a summit next month, everybody understands Britain’s position. But, as he found out today, getting everybody to agree to that position is quite another thing. james Landale, BBC News, in Berlin. A blanket ban on so-called legal highs has been proposed in a draft law. Anyone producing, selling or supplying mind altering substances, except alcohol, tobacco and caffeine, would face up to seven years in jail. Legal highs have been linked to a number of deaths. Our home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford has more. For nearly a decade now, high-street shops and websites have been selling unlicensed mind altering drugs, marketing them as legal highs. Although not banned, they can be very dangerous. This was 11+-year-old Owain Vaughan, just after he smoked one brand of legal high. Fortunately, he survived. Reliving today the moment two months ago when he took the drug. It hit me instantly. It is all fuzzy, my memory is all fuzzy. My heart slowing down, and hitting the floor. Not being able to move, walk, talk, nothing. At the time, police officers came and gripped me. Iran and fell on my face. He was in the ambulance, wired up to machines. He had a drip, he was fitting. He was shaking. I asked the ambulance men why he was shaking. They said he was fitting, we need to go. I don’t want any other family to go through what we’ve been through. Both know it was a lucky escape. The government has tried banning each legal high as it was invented. At this Home Office lab, they’ve just seen new, slightly altered psychoactive substances appear to take the banned drugs places. Most of the psychoactive substances sold in Britain are made in China. Leaving scientists here trying to catch up and identify them as they come on the market. Today, ministers took a dramatic and new approach, publishing a Bill to ban the sale of all mind altering chemicals, except medicines, alcohol, caffeine, and tobacco and food. But the owner of this shop said it would not work. The government are trying to sweep it under the carpet by putting a blanket ban on it. Making it a criminal offence. That drives it underground. In truth, no one knows if users will go back to take legal substances like alcohol or turn to the drug dealers. Daniel Sandford, BBC News. The mother of two children who died from carbon monoxide poisoning on a Thomas Cook holiday, has said she finds the actions of the company’s former boss ""abhorrent"". Earlier this week Harriet Green announced she would donate a third of her bonus to charity, in memory of Bobby and Christi Shepherd. An inquest found they were unlawfully killed in Corfu in 2006. Frankie McCamley has this report. Killed at just six and seven years old, Christi and Bobby were on a family holiday nine years ago. They never came home. They were staying on the Greek island of Corfu in this bungalow with their father, Neil, and his partner, Ruth. The boiler on the side of the property was found to have been installed incorrectly and was leaking fumes. The children died from carbon monoxide poisoning. The adults survived. In 2010, three people, including the manager of the Louis Corcyra Beach Hotel, were found guilty of manslaughter by negligence and sentenced to seven years in prison. It later emerged that Thomas Cook received a compensation pay-out after the deaths, reportedly to be in the region of £3 million. The parents say they received around a tenth of that figure. Earlier this month, an inquest here in the UK found Bobby and Christi had been unlawfully killed and Thomas Cook had breached its duty of care. This week, the former boss of the travel company, Harriet Green, announced she would be donating a third of her estimated £10 million bonus to a charity of the parents’ choice. But today, their mother, Sharon, has accused Ms Green of trying to use her children’s memory to gain public sympathy. If Harriet Green feels the need to off-load some of that money to salve her conscience, that is her decision to make. But to try and gain public empathy by attaching her donation to the memory of my Christi and Bobby I find abhorrent. The former boss of Thomas Cook has said she’s deeply saddened that Christi and Bobby’s mother feels like this. It’s thought she’s offered to meet with the family next week. This is BBC News, I’m Gavin Grey. The US defence Secretary has issued America’s strongest warning over disputed waters in the South China Sea. Sepp Blatter has been re-elected president of Fifa despite being at the helm during one of the biggest corruption scandals to rock world football. Myanmar says its navy has rescued more than 700 migrants off the country’s south coast. News of the rescue comes as regional representatives have been meeting in Thailand to address the crisis. Thousands of migrants, many of them persecuted Rohingya Muslims, are at the mercy of people traffickers. Our international correspondent, Ian Pannell, has been to Thai-Malaysia border. His report contains disturbing first hand testimony. The wild borderlands of Malaysia. Where migrant dreams of a promised land didn’tjust vanish in the mist, they were crushed into the ground. Rohingya Muslims fled persecution in Myanmar and were brought to these camps. But the men who promised to save them held them hostage instead. They were beaten, tortured, raped and many were killed. We’re in the deepjungle on the Malaysian-Thai border. This is the area that holds the darkest of secrets. There are more than 1+0 camps believed to be in this area and I’m standing in one of them. It’s very makeshift. There are bits of wood tied together, makeshift shelters, very little to protect people. Some people were kept in these areas for as long as two years. There are more than 1+0 camps like this believed to be hidden in these woods. Nearly 11+0 bodies have been recovered and the prediction is that there could be hundreds more buried somewhere in thisjungle. We met some of those held in these camps. Abdul Hakim staggered out of the jungle this week with just a pair of shorts to his name. He had been held for an astonishing two years in the jungle. As the police closed in, the traffickers fled and the migrants escaped. Abdul Hakim has the face of a haunted man. He was starved, beaten and tortured. TRANSLATION: At the end of this month I would have been two years in this camp. We couldn’t pay the ransom money so we were tortured and kept there. They poured boiling oil on us. Sometimes the traffickers hanged people. A lot of people died and the place was covered with graves. A lot of people died. And the memories will be with them forever. Rashida loves her baby daughter but the little girl will always remind her of the jungle camps where she was raped by so many men that she doesn’t know who Ayisha’s father is. TRANSLATION: They beat and killed the boys and raped the girls who couldn’t give them money. Life is really bad in Myanmar and we can’t survive there. That’s why we left. But it’s hard to survive here, too. When we go out the police take money from us and sometimes we are arrested. We thought Malaysia would be better but it’s the same. So, Rashida lives in the shadows with other migrants, fleeing hardships at home, risking journeys at sea, and suffering the horrors of the jungle camps - and for what? They’re non-people in their promised land. For those who survived the camps there is neither dignity nor hope. Rashida must beg on a bridge with her baby and other migrants from Myanmar, just to survive. Malaysia doesn’t class them as refugees. The UN stopped giving them papers and has failed to help her. They have endured the worst humanity can sink to. And yet still no-one sees them, and no-one wants them. In other news: The so-called Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for a suicide bomb attack on a Shia mosque in Saudi Arabia that killed four people. It happened in the Eastern city of Dammam, home to most of the country’s Shia minority. Exactly one week ago, the group attacked another Shia mosque in the region, killing 20. Members of Nepal’s Sherpa community, living at Everest, say they have seen potentially dangerous changes in their landscape after the 7.8 magnitude earthquake and aftershocks. They say they are living in fear of flooding and tumbling rock and ice because they’ve seen cracks in the ground and in glaciers. Some glacial lakes have sunk underground with their outlets appearing in new places. Within days an investigation in Argentina is expected to rule that special prosecutor Alberto Nisman, who was found damp in january under suspicious circumstances, probably killed himself. Shortly before he died, Nisman accused the government in Buenos Aires of trying to cover up to worst terror attack in the country’s history. Now Nisman’s ex-wife has launched her own investigation into his death. She’s been speaking exclusively to our correspondent Wyre Davies. Alberto Nisman is buried in a quiet corner of this cemetery in one size. His grave is piled high with stones of remembrance. He spent two decades investigating who was behind one of the worst terror attacks in Argentine history. Underlie the 18th, 1991+, a massive car bomb destroyed Asociacion Mutual Israelita Argentina, a jewish centre in Buenos Aires, killing 18 people. No one has been convicted of the AM I a bombing. No one has been convicted of the AM Ia bombing. 21 years later, a huge amount of evidence has been amassed. Interviews, witness statements, and wiretaps. Alberto Nisman spent 17 years working on this case. It was his life’s work. This was among the evidence that in 2006, it led him to formally accused Iran of being behind the attack. In 2013, when the Argentine President made a deal with the run tojointly Argentine President made a deal with the run to jointly investigate the bombing, he felt betrayed and began a parallel enquiry into the government. -- Iran. But he was found dead at his flat this year, just hours before he was due to testify in Congress about his claims that the President and other senior officials had been involved in covering up Iran’s alleged role in the attack. TRANSLATION: For the first time since the prosecutor’s death, his former partner, a districtjudge herself, agreed to sit down for an exclusive interview. She says that investigators are rushing towards an conclusion that he committed suicide. TRANSLATION: I have no doubt that because of the way he was, his personality, he never would have taken his own life. He was extremely careful about his health and was even afraid of dying young. So the moment they told me he was found dead and there was a gun at the scene, I knew someone had killed him. Official images obtained by the BBC points to a shocking lapse of medical and procedure at the flat where he died. Several people walking a levy the scene and evidence and property collected. -- all over the scene. The woman in charge of the official investigation into his death denies the office mishandled the initial hours of the scene. TRANSLATION: It is common in Argentina that we don’t always put on those white and he said roads. I have been too many homicides and not warned that kind of clothing because we don’t touch the scene. -- antisepctic. What is certain is that he never made it to Congress to deliver his controversial report. The official investigation has still to rule on the cause of death. But a few people here now believe this was a case of suicide. After a pioneering transplant three years ago, the sister of a man who died in a car crash has now met the person who was given her brother’s face. Richard Norris had suffered horrific facial injuries from a shotgun accident but the transplant has transformed this life. jon Sopel reports. Rebekah donated her dead brother’s face so another man could live... Three years after her brother’s death, three years after the transplant, Rebekah Aversano comes face to human face with the recipient. Do you mind if I touch it? No, not at all. The procedure, the first of its kind to be carried out in the world, is massively complex. Richard Norris was in the operating theatre for 36 hours, with teams of doctors involved. He had suffered a serious gunshot wound which had turned his face from this, to this. They transplanted facial tissue, tongue, teeth and upper and lowerjaw. The chief surgeon told me how Richard Norris is doing today. He’s integrating very well to society. He is going to school. He has a girlfriend that is by his side. To see him now, he is a totally different person than the one I transplanted back in 2012. I’m very proud of him. What about the ethical dimension? It’s one thing transplanting an anonymous organ under the skin, quite another a human face. When you look at the face of a donor on a recipient, although there are some resemblances, it does not look exactly like the donor, so the possibility of seeing your donor walking around, it’s not exactly as one would expect. And now the medics are looking at how these techniques might be used to help wounded soldiers returning to America. jon Sopel, BBC News, Washington. Next month sees the two-hundredth anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo. The historic conflict which saw the defeat of Napoleon, and the end to his ambitions to dominate Europe. All sorts of events will be taking place, including an exhibition with a difference. Tim Allman explains. Napoleon crossing the Alps. One of the most iconic images of France ‘s famous Emperor General. But look closely. This portrait is not quite what it seems. In Waterloo, Napoleon did surrender, so the song goes and what better way to remember it than with Lego? Lots and lots of Lego. Around a million bits of Lego, in fact. There is Napoleon, his Empressjosephine, infantrymen and cavalry, a replica of the Imperial throne and even a version of his famous bi-corn hat. TRANSLATION: More than 20 people, modelers and builders, worked on the Waterloo exhibition usiing around 100 million building blocks representing around 1000 hours of construction work, particularly if you take the Castle of Malmaison. There were 20,000 bricks! The biggest project is Invalides Dome, burial site of Napoleon, two and a half metres high and weighing half a ton, it is made up of 300,000 Lego bricks. TRANSLATION: We wanted to do something for children who generally come with their parents and grandparents. This exhibition meet our expectations and provide a better understanding of the Battle of Waterloo for all generations. There is also a miniature Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel, celebrating some of the battles that Napoleon did win. The Emperor was apparently a man conscious of his diminutive stature, so it is not certain that he would have appreciated this. Coming up next is Click. But first the Weather with Nick Miller. Welcome to the weekend. Disappointingly cool for the time of year. We will all see rain at some stage but it is not a washout of a weekend. Certainly a chilly start to Saturday morning, even rural ground frost in some places but Saturday offers not just a fine start but fine and dry weather for many of us throughout the day. Not wall-to-wall sunshine, some of us will have rather cloudy skies and there will be one or two showers in northern Scotland but as the day goes on, we will see the odd shower in eastern areas of England and the Midlands. At 1+:00pm there is a weather system approaching the south-west and south-west Wales and Northern Ireland and that comes in during the evening. At this stage most places are looking dry. There will be some sunny spells around Northern Ireland, it is not warm but the sun makes all the difference. If you are out of the breeze and in the sun it is not too bad. Northern Scotland will see one or two showers, the rest of Scotland sees a decent amount of sunshine as does much of northern England. The odd shower reaching part of the Midlands at this stage in the afternoon but the rest of England and much of Wales is seeing a lot of cloud and 16 degrees in London. Two Cup Final games in the world of football, the sunniest weather will be in Scotland but both are looking dry and it is a dry start to the weekend action at the cricket at Headingley but on Sunday, it is a different story. Let’s find out why. As we end Saturday, weather fronts are approaching so it will turn wet in the west over Saturday evening with a freshening wind and the UK through Headingley and for the rest of us as well. It would give many a wet and windy start to Sunday but bear with it because it will not wash out the whole day. It will get dry and eventually brighter although some may see a further shower. The rain will push away east on Sunday morning and eastern Scotland and England will keep it going into the afternoon. Following behind, it will brighten up slowly with a few showers in northern and western areas in particular. Monday and Tuesday does not look like spring or summer, it is more like autumn with this area of low pressure promising more rain and strong winds or gales but as we go through next week, the weather transforms from that very autumnal looking feel at the start of the week to something more settled and eventually more summerlike at the end of the week. The latest headlines from BBC News. I’m Gavin Grey. The US Secretary of Defence has issued America’s strongest warning yet over the creation by China of new islands which it’s using to try to extend its sovereignty in the South China Sea. Ash Carter said the US is ‘deeply concerned’ and will ‘fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows.' Sepp Blatter has been re-elected president of football’s world governing body FIFA for a fifth term - despite separate US and Swiss criminal investigations into alleged Fifa corruption. Mr Blatter secured his tenure for another four years after his only rival withdrew after the first round of voting. The BBC has heard further allegations of the torture, rape and murder of Rohingya migrants from Myanmar. A BBC correspondent, who travelled to a camp formerly used by people traffickers in Malaysia, said people spoke of being detained, beaten, tortured and raped. Some were taken and never returned. Those are the headlines - coming up injust over 10 minutes is Newswatch but now on BBC News, it’s time for Click. Hi there, welcome to South Korea - the most advanced country on the planet. (FUNKY MUSIC). After years of competition with japan, Korea has conquered the technology world. It has the highest penetration of mobile phones in the world, the fastest Internet speeds on the planet. We all use their phones, and we all watch their TVs. It is a country that has fully embraced technology. It is a fantastic place to get a glimpse of what might be possible and practical in the future. Here, in Songdo, a smart city built on reclaimed land. The idea is to show what is possible when the Internet of things becomes a reality. And every device, from heating to the furniture, is online. When you have a teleconference link to every other apartment, you can use it for anything, from learning to catching up with friends, to remote ukelele lessons, obviously, and you can use it in any other way that residents want to communicate with each other. This mockup control room combines ideas from different Korean start-ups, to show how they could be integrated into a fully functioning system where people, as well as devices, are plugged into the net. If a child who is supposed to be at school suddenly strays from the building, their GPS tag alerts the office, which in turn alerts the community. The child’s location is tracked and staff get to watch every camera along their route, live. Yes, this country really puts technology first in everything it does these days. It has more industrial robots per human worker than anywhere else, making up more than 1+% of the workforce. Now, it is time for me to meet a robot that might one day step into my shoes. This is Hubo. It is about to embark on the toughest test known to robotkind. Next weekend, it is the DARPA Robotics Challenge, where research teams from around the world will show up in California with their robots. The mission is to complete a series of very human tasks with minimal human help. Wow! My gosh! Tomorrow, the team pack up and fly out, meaning today is the last day of practice on their practice course. It is unbelievably tough. Will out of the car, he reveals he does notjust have feet, but wheels of his own. In role mode, he can go faster. Come on, baby. Next it is time to spin the gas valve and time to get some help coming very limited, from the humans in the control room. Now the challenge allows for limited human control which means that they can see what Hubo sees and identify the valve for him. Then it is up to the robot to go to it and do the manual work. It has it’s hand on the wheel. Yes! It is turning the gas off. Handling the drill is an even bigger test. Once it has been identified by the team, it is up to the sensors in the hands of Hubo to feel it, find the button and apply the correct pressure to cut it. Robot DIY! It is feeling the resistance of the drill. Oh yes! Down it goes and it is freakish in its transformation stage. Lets have a look at some of the other projects here. This is the MIT of South Korea, with over 10,000 students and over 1000 researchers. A tiny fraction of whom jim Cope steak and I have visited to see what is going on behind these closed doors. Here at the urban robotics lab, researchers are developing machines to work in unusual places. We have seen many drones here on Click but never one that can climb a wall. It is so loud! Very powerful, the drone sticks to the wall with the thrust generated by its four rotors and then climbs the wall using its wheels. It has a camera on the bottom it can use to inspect difficult to reach places like wind turbines, or it can be used to clean windows on tall buildings with some adaptation. This drones requires no expensive infrastructure to work and the team says if it falls off, it can easily fly itself back to where it is meant to be. I’m just going to go brush my hair. Spencer is outside with more urban robotics. Here is a problem you didn’t know Korea had. jellyfish. They are a nightmare for the fishing industry and cause about $230 million worth of damage a year. Here is the solution and it is not for the faint hearted so if you have a weak stomach, go and do something else for a few minutes, because these are jellyfish hunting robots and when they find the jellyfish, they shred them. It is a serious enough problem for the Korean government to fund the project. The robots themselves behave like a swarm, one is the leader and the others follow information. and the others follow in formation. The machines are fitted with cameras which guide them into position, netting the jellyfish and then doing the bit you probably do not want to see so here it is. Yuck. OK, let’s deal with the main thing that is going through your mind right now. Is this cruel? I think it is not cruel because the jellyfish don’t have a brain, and they are just some kind of plankton, and we can shred them because they are just like the plant. At the moment, these are guided to the general area of the swarm by jellyfish detecting technology but soon they will have a real support as a drone flies over the sea and uses image recognition to spot swarms and instruct these guys on where to go so the mincing can begin. I may well be in the minority but I love 3-D cinema so the promise of the experience without the glasses was something I had to experience. There are three screens in front of me, one to my left and one to my left and one in front for a total immersive experience. Invented at the visual media lab, ScreenX is used to change how we see films by giving a small number of relatively inexpensive projectors which can be installed in cinemas anywhere in the world. Turn the projectors off and the cinema can be used again for regular films. This technology has been around for a couple of years but there haven’t really been any full-length feature films screened. Most of the content has been commercials. Designing movies for this format has many challenges and expenses for the film crew. One challenge would be to use three different cameras to cover three sides, 270 degrees so it will give you some challenges because if you use only one camera to shoot a movie, things can hide behind the camera, whereas with a film camera coming when there are three, there is nowhere to hide. It is terrifying, thinking there might be a ghost coming to your side! The first full-length movie release for ScreenX will be later this month in Korea with plans to bring the screens to Europe in 2016 and possibly using the ceiling as well. And finally, back to Hubo who has made mince meat of the robotic challenge so far. This is the final part of the challenge, it needs to mount the podium. It is 80 kg, slightly heavier than me. It is doing it. The last step. Last step, Hubo! Oh! LAUGHING. All it needs now is an Arnold Schwarzenegger mask and we can all be satisfied at the rise of the machines happening. Ijust can’t believe it. Hubo has completed the course. It has taken 38 minutes, the team are aiming for 35 so on their last day of rehearsal, they are close. So I wish this team behind Hubo all the best of luck in the DARPA challenge, if this is the level we have got to with robotics, then, well, we are all in trouble. And that is it from Click in Korea for this week. We have another Korea special for you next week. In the meantime, we are at Twitter. Thank you so much were joining me on this adventure, Thank you so much forjoining me on this adventure, it has been fantastic. We will see you next week. # GANGNAM STYLE #. $:srARrrsso. Hello, welcome to Newswatch with me, Steve Hewlett. Coming up on this programme, the BBC’s world affairs editor john Simpson tells us about the challenges of reporting from the front line of Iraq’s fight against Islamic State militants. And how will this programme, currently made for an international audience, work for domestic viewers when it arrives on the News Channel next week? Parts of Syria and Iraq have become extremely dangerous and unpredictable places forjournalists to operate in - not least since the city of Ramadi was captured by Islamic State militants two weeks ago. Pro-government forces are now trying to drive the jihadists out of Anbar Province, from where the BBC’s world affairs editorjohn Simpson reported on Monday night. This is what they call the front line, in the sense that it is the closest the Iraqi forces get to the last remaining Islamic State positions, just on the other side of that ridge, there. Mostly, the fire is outgoing. There aren’t that many Islamic State fighters left. But they have just told us we have got to get out in case all the fire and excitement here attract incoming mortar fire. But as well as the obvious problems of safety and logistics, reporting about Islamic State presents other dangers. One of them is articulated by viewer Andy Wood in this e-mail. john Simpson is now back from Iraq and is here with me now. Thanks very much for coming. Are you, do you think, and the media more generally, really guilty of giving IS propaganda? It is the kind of thing people say, whenever you get this kind of situation, ""You are giving them air time, you are doing their propaganda work for them."" I mean, what is news? Otherwise we wouldn’t be reporting anything. People often say, ""Oh, would the BBC have been in Berlin in 191+3?"" Of course we would have been, if we had been able to. Of course, we don’t want to tell people less than we can. We want to tell them as much as we can. You’ve been covering conflicts for a long time, often featuring combatants, some of whom are described as terrorists, from time to time, one thing or another. How does covering this conflict differ? This is really, really hard. I’ve kind of made what I laughingly call a career out of really being on the other side, not our Government’s side, not the side of people who say you mustn’t give these people propaganda, but going and trying to see what is happening there. I used to do a lot of work with the IRA. I then went to Argentina, during the Falklands War. All of these kinds of things. You met the Taliban? And the Taliban, I spent a lot of time with, yes. And I would really like to go and see Isis, except that I would be one of these characters in an orangejumpsuit with my head being sawn off. When it is as extreme as that, it really does make it difficult. If I could find a way, Steve, of going and being pretty sure! would come back, I would do it. I wouldn’t tell the BBC before I do it, I don’t think, but I would go and do it. But I haven’t found a way of doing that. Do you think that because of this, or that effect, that we are less well informed about this conflict and the dynamics of it than we might otherwise be? I think if we saw the kind of people that are in places like Ramadi and Mosul, upfront, and listened to what they had to say, I think that would be the strongest propaganda against them that is imaginable. It may be that some of them are wise enough to realise ands that’s why they don’t want to do it. How sure can you believe that you know what is happening? In the piece that we looked at, there is a bit where you say, ""One thing about this conflict is you never see the enemy."" You see lots of people firing, but you never see who they are firing at. All you able to say is that IS are somewhere over that ridge, sort of thing. How sure can you be that you’re getting the truth about what’s going on? It’s hard, of course. The fact is, the Iraqis aren’t terribly good at... Well, they are not very good at lying, actually, the Iraqi government. Of course, when they win some places back, they are not actually terribly good about taking journalists there. But you can go there, you can see by the facts on the ground whether Isis is there or not. Frankly, you rather hope they won’t be. One last question, if I may. You have said that if you could, you would like to talk to IS, if you could do it without losing your head, sensibly. In every sense! Have you made any attempts to get to them, and are there any arrangements under way, any form of communication at all? Well, I probably wouldn’t say if there were. Actually, no. Because I don’t know, through the normal channels in Iraq and Syria, and so forth, I don’t know how to make contact with them. But, you know, you get a nose for these kind of things. One day, it might be possible. The problem is, you’ve got to have absolutely failsafe agreements that they won’t kill you. Whatever else, that’s not a very bright idea, I don’t want to make the news. OK, thank you very much indeed. Now, from Monday there will be a number of changes to the schedule on the BBC News Channel, prompted, the BBC says, by the need for cutbacks following the freeze in the licence fee agreed in 2010. Viewers in the UK will see more programmes which will be simultaneously shown abroad on the BBC’s World News Channel. That has led to fears that the reduction in journalistic resources will make it harder to cover big, breaking news stories here at home. We will be exploring that concern in a future edition of Newswatch. In the meantime, let’s look at one of the shows which will be given a regular slot on the News Channel from next week. Four nights a week, nine o’clock, Outside Source will be broadcast from the heart of the BBC’s main newsroom, just upstairs from us here in London, mixing up interviews and reports with instant reaction from newswires and social media from all around the world. The BBC is pushing the global news programme as a new style of deconstructed news for the digital age. So, how is that going to work for viewers of the News Channel here at home? The presenter of Outside Source is Ros Atkins and he joins me now. Thanks very much for coming. Pleasure. So, help me out here, what does deconstructed news for the digital age really mean? What it really means is that the internet has fundamentally altered how we all consume news and the various elements that add up to one story or issue that we are interested in. So, for instance, if you are on your phone and you are looking into what is happening in the north-east of Nigeria, you might look at a map, you might look at a long article, you might look at a clip from the President of Nigeria. You might also look at some footage from Boko Haram that they have posted on the net, you might look at some tweets from a local news agency. The list goes on and on. How we consume news online tends to be in a nonlinearform. We see something, we go in the direction that our interest takes us. But this is a TV show? This is a TV show. But with TV and radio, which traditionally do start at A and go to B, we don’t necessarily need to be as linear as perhaps we have been in the past. The idea of Outside Source is, it is myjob to weave together the different elements of any one story. So, how’s this going to work for a UK audience, many of whom, as you will know, when they’re polled, often say they have had enough of international news already, thanks. It’s going to work for a UK audience in that I think, although some people may say they’ve had enough of international news, I think, actually, the majority of people are incredibly interested in the world that we live in. And they might be surprised that the volume of expertise and content, and journalism, that we have within the BBC. The BBC World Service, for instance, has journalists working in 28 different languages. How often do we see the work that they are doing? I think if people do see that work, they will definitely be interested. So, you have been on world global news, the World News Channel, for quite a while, now you are going to be appearing in front of UK audiences. Is it going to change your agenda? It’s not going to really change our agenda. We do UK stories anyway. There are plenty of UK stories that cut through. Obviously we have just had a general election and we covered that extensively on BBC World News. What I would say is that any type of journalism caters to an audience. Within that audience, there are different groups of people. Some might know one story better than another group. I’ve just given you the example of Nigeria, a story today with Boko Haram. We broadcast in Nigeria and, when! am talking about a Nigerian’s country, I might make a reference to my script to, ""Well, those of you in Nigeria will need me to tell you..."" And so and so. If we are doing a UK story, for instance we’re going to be doing sport every day, so when we talk about football on BBC World News, I talk about the EPL, the English Premier League. No-one here says that. Clearly, I am going to need to find language that doesn’tjar with the UK audience. All I would say is that presenters ought to be able to find language that brings in different audiences, some of whom know more about a story than others. Lastly, and I know this is going to come up as a topic of conversation, in the event that there is a major breaking story in the UK, are you going to be equipped to deal with it? We are definitely equipped. I say that, given that the whole point was to save money by running the same show, it used to be UK, and now it’s going to be global on both networks. Is the journalistic resource behind you going to be there to service a big breaking story? Well, I couldn’t tell you the journalistic budget behind this programme, but what I can tell you is that always, Outside Source has access to the resources of the BBC newsroom, which are just about unparalleled in the world. If there is a UK story which we want to cover and it is significant enough for us to roll on it, to cover it as developing news, I’m really not going to go short of resources.

Disappointingly cool for the time of year. We will all see rain at some stage but it is not a washout of a weekend. Certainly a chilly start to Saturday morning, even rural ground frost in some places but Saturday offers not just a fine start but fine and dry weather for many of us throughout the day. Not wall-to-wall sunshine, some of us will have rather cloudy skies and there will be one or two showers in northern Scotland but as the day goes on, we will see the odd shower in eastern areas of England and the Midlands. At 1+:00pm there is a weather system approaching the south-west and south-west Wales and Northern Ireland and that comes in during the evening. At this stage most places are looking dry. There will be some sunny spells around Northern Ireland, it is not warm but the sun makes all the difference. If you are out of the breeze and in the sun it is not too bad. Northern Scotland will see one or two showers, the rest of Scotland sees a decent amount of sunshine as does much of northern England. The odd shower reaching part of the Midlands at this stage in the afternoon but the rest of England and much of Wales is seeing a lot of cloud and 16 degrees in London. Two Cup Final games in the world of football, the sunniest weather will be in Scotland but both are looking dry and it is a dry start to the weekend action at the cricket at Headingley but on Sunday, it is a different story. Let’s find out why. As we end Saturday, weather fronts are approaching so it will turn wet in the west over Saturday evening with a freshening wind and the UK through Headingley and for the rest of us as well. It would give many a wet and windy start to Sunday but bear with it because it will not wash out the whole day. It will get dry and eventually brighter although some may see a further shower. The rain will push away east on Sunday morning and eastern Scotland and England will keep it going into the afternoon. Following behind, it will brighten up slowly with a few showers in northern and western areas in particular. Monday and Tuesday does not look like spring or summer, it is more like autumn with this area of low pressure promising more rain and strong winds or gales but as we go through next week, the weather transforms from that very autumnal looking feel at the start of the week to something more settled and eventually more summerlike at the end of the week. Welcome to BBC News, broadcasting to our viewers on public television in the US and around the globe. I’m Gavin Grey. Our top stories: The US Secretary of Defence issues America’s strongest warning yet over Beijing’s activities in the South China Sea. Sepp Blatter is re-elected as president of FIFA - despite the charges of corruption against some of his officials. As thousands of Asian migrants continue their desperate journey, we have a special report from the Thai-Malaysia border. And we look at why the draft UN report stopped short of listing the Great Barrier Reef as an endangered site. Hello. The United States has called for ""an immediate and lasting halt"" to reclamation works by all claimants in disputed waters in the South China Sea. Speaking in Singapore a short time ago, the US Defence Secretary Ashton Carter told China that its behaviour in the area was ""out of step"" with international norms and rules. Bill Hayton reports. Out in the middle of the South China Sea, China is creating land. It is turning nine Coral reefs into naval bases. Two of them will have major Brian Rose. In their natural state, most of these features would be underwater. That means they don’t count as territory under international wall -- runways. The US has began operations to challenge China’s claims, flying planes close to the new bases. The American Defence Secretary has called on China to stop what it is doing. There should be an immediate and lasting halt to land reclamation by all claimants. We also oppose any further militarisation of disputed features. He also made clear the US will push back attempts to prevent its ships and planes using the sea. There should be no mistake that the United States will fly, sale and operate wherever international law allows. As US forces do all over the world. -- sail. Those policies have provoked criticism from Beijing. TRANSLATION: We urge the United States, which is not a party to the South China Sea dispute, to take a responsible attitude, be prudent in words and deeds, be reasonable and calm, and stop making provocative remarks. Other countries around the South China Sea are stepping up their cooperation in the face of China’s moves. Earlierthis their cooperation in the face of China’s moves. Earlier this week, Vietnamese and Philippine troops took part in their second ever day of-- of sporting activities. Fun but with a serious purpose. Both the US and China appear determined to stand their ground, but for now, the clashes will be confined to the hotel ballroom. Bill Hayden, BBC News. Sepp Blatter has been re-elected president of FIFA, despite being at the helm during one of the biggest corruption scandals to rock world football. Mr Blatter secured another four years after his only rival, Prince Ali bin al-Hussein ofjordan, withdrew, though he won enough support to force a second round of voting. Football’s world governing body has become the subject of two criminal investigations in Switzerland and the US amid accusations of ""rampant corruption"". In his acceptance speech in Zurich, Mr Blatter said he took ‘full responsibility’ for restoring Fifa’s reputation. Our Sports Editor Dan Roan has more. Somehow he had done it again. At the end of the most turbulent week in Fifa’s history, Sepp Blatter tonight able to celebrate clinging to power. The 79-year-old living up to his reputation as sport’s great survivor having extended his scandal-hit regime into a fifth term. I thank you, I thank you that you accepted me, that for the next four years I will be in command of this boat called Fifa and we will bring it back. We will bring it back off shore. Earlier, Blatter’s challenger, hoping he could pull off one of the sport’s biggest ever results. Inside an early sign of the rancour that surrounds. Security, please. Protesters disrupting proceedings. Wednesday’s arrest of football officials plunging it into turmoil. Ali now vowing to restore the organisation’s battered reputation. We have heard questions raised about whether our family is morally bankrupt. If you give me the honour of your votes I will take full responsibility and hold myself accountable to all of you and to the world. Blatter meanwhile, pleading with his supporters in Africa and Asia for another chance. I would quite simply like to stay with you. I would like to stay with you. I would like to continue with you. With that, it was time for Fifa to decide. Each delegate casting a vote in turn. Blatter polled 133 votes to 73. That was close enough to trigger a second round. But Ali withdrew. Blatter had prevailed, although opposition remains. This isn’t over by any means. The events of this week are so traumatic for Fifa that I cannot see Fifa reforming itself under Blatter. He has had 16 years to reform it. He hasn’t done it. The events of this week are so profound. If you listen to what the Attorney General in America said, this is the beginning and not the end. I think there is an awful lot more for this to play out. But for now, having weathered the storm, Blatter was left to bask in the glory of victory. The scandal he has survived, however, is set to linger on. Myanmar says its navy has rescued more than 700 migrants off the country’s south coast. News of the rescue comes as regional representatives have been meeting in Thailand to address the crisis. Thousands of migrants, many of them persecuted Rohingya Muslims, are at the mercy of people traffickers. Once on dry land, they imprison the migrants and hold them for ransom. Our International correspondent Ian Pannell has been to Thai-Malaysia border. His report contains disturbing first hand testimony. The wild borderlands of Malaysia. Where migrant dreams of a promised land didn’tjust vanish in the mist, they were crushed into the ground. Rohingya Muslims fled persecution in Myanmar and were brought to these camps. But the men who promised to save them held them hostage instead. They were beaten, tortured, raped and many were killed. We’re in the deepjungle on the Malaysian-Thai border. This is the area that holds the darkest of secrets. There are more than 1+0 camps believed to be in this area and I’m standing in one of them. It’s very makeshift. There are bits of wood tied together, makeshift shelters, very little to protect people. Some people were kept in these areas for as long as two years. There are more than 1+0 camps like this believed to be hidden in these woods. Nearly 11+0 bodies have been recovered and the prediction is that there could be hundreds more buried somewhere in thisjungle. We met some of those held in these camps. Abdul Hakim staggered out of the jungle this week with just a pair of shorts to his name. He had been held for an astonishing two years in the jungle. As the police closed in, the traffickers fled and the migrants escaped. Abdul Hakim has the face of a haunted man. He was starved, beaten and tortured. TRANSLATION: At the end of this month I would have been two years in this camp. We couldn’t pay the ransom money so we were tortured and kept there. They poured boiling oil on us. Sometimes the traffickers hanged people. A lot of people died and the place was covered with graves. A lot of people died. And the memories will be with them forever. Rashida loves her baby daughter but the little girl will always remind her of the jungle camps where she was raped by so many men that she doesn’t know who Ayisha’s father is. TRANSLATION: They beat and killed the boys and raped the girls who couldn’t give them money. Life is really bad in Myanmar and we can’t survive there. That’s why we left. But it’s hard to survive here, too. When we go out the police take money from us and sometimes we are arrested. We thought Malaysia would be better but it’s the same. So Rashida lives in the shadows with other migrants, fleeing hardships at home, risking journeys at sea, and suffering the horrors of the jungle camps - and for what? They’re non-people in their promised land. For those who survived the camps there is neither dignity nor hope. Rashida must beg on a bridge with her baby and other migrants from Myanmar, just to survive. Malaysia doesn’t class them as refugees. The UN stopped giving them papers and has failed to help her. They have endured the worst humanity can sink to. And yet still no-one sees them, and no-one wants them. David Cameron, visiting Angela Merkel in Berlin today, received a boost to his plans for EU reform when the German Chancellor said she wasn’t ruling out changes to existing European treaties. But there was a less positive response in Poland about his idea to curb migrants’ rights to welfare as our deputy political editor james Landale reports. In Berlin today, they pulled out all the stops. Guards of honour, yards of red carpet, and a warm hug and a kiss. He doesn’t get this everywhere. But this was not just a display of German respect for a newly elected PM, it was also the continent’s most powerful politician extending the hand of friendship towards a leader she wants in lockstep, not just with her, but also the rest of Europe. So, after a quick lunch, Chancellor Merkeljoined David Cameron before the cameras and suggested she could do a deal with her guest over his plans to reform the European Union. TRANSLATION: We want to work closely together in the process that the UK is now going through towards a referendum. We would like to help in a constructive way. As I’ve said before, where there’s a will, there’s a way. And that’s quite something to say when Mr Cameron wants to cut migrants’ benefits, opt Britain out of ever closer union and give national parliaments new powers to block EU laws. What chance do you believe that David Cameron has in achieving his reforms, given the opposition that you and so many other leaders have towards the treaty changes that he’s seeking? TRANSLATION: If you are convinced of an idea, you can’t say that treaty change is an absolute impossibility. To a PM who has been told no so often, this, perhaps, WGS VâI’y WâlCO!T!â. I was very heartened by what the Chancellor said in terms of where there’s a will, there’s a way. If content requires changes in treaties, then you can’t let that stand in the way of what needs to be done. What Europe needs to be, it needs to have the flexibility of a network, not the rigidity of a bloc. Earlier, the mood in Poland was less positive. Mr Cameron and the Polish PM agreed the EU needed to be more competitive. But she told him of her strong disagreement with any benefit cuts that might discriminate against Polish nationals in Britain. If we are talking about imposing certain solutions that are going to divide European citizens, and some of the proposals could be read in this way, then obviously we would be against. David Cameron’s aim on this grand tour of Europe is to make sure that when the negotiations begin in earnest at a summit next month, everybody understands Britain’s position. But, as he found out today, getting everybody to agree to that position is quite another thing. james Landale, BBC News, in Berlin. Stay with us on BBC News - still to come: Waterloo, in miniature, the exhibition celebrating an historic battle on a small scale Let’s see what’s been making headlines around the world, with a look at the international papers. We start with Gulf News, which leads on one of our top stories, the re-election of Fifa president, Sepp Blatter. He won his fifth term of office when Prince Ali Bin Al Hussain ofjordan conceded defeat after losing in the first round of votes. Ajubilant Mr Blatter can be seen on the front of the Financial Times. His election follows a torrid week for football’s world governing body and the indictment of numerous officials on corruption charges. Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post leads on a health scare in the territory. 18 people have been put under quarantine after coming into contact with a Korean man believed to be suffering from the MERS virus. Staying in the region, and China Daily says the government is to step up its efforts to combat the illegal trade in ivory. Nearly 700 kilos of confiscated ivory were detroyed by officials in Beijing on Friday. This is BBC News. I’m Gavin Grey. The latest headlines: The US Defence Secretary has issued America’s strongest warning yet over Beijing’s activities in the disputed waters in the South China Sea. Sepp Blatter has been re-elected president of Fifa, despite being at the helm during one of the biggest corruption scandals to rock world football. The Great Barrier Reef should not go on a World Heritage danger list, according to a United Nations draft report. However, it says Australia must carry out its commitments to protect the reef, including restoring water quality and limiting industrial activity nearby. The final decision on its status will be made at the World Heritage Committee meeting in Germany next month. Dr Steven Miles, Queensland Minister for Environment and Minister of the Great Barrier Reef says finding the best result for the Queensland area is a fine balance. This decision is a really great result for one of the world ‘s living wonders. This draft decision from the world heritage committee saying that they think the plan we have developed to improve the Great Barrier Reef is the right plan. But there are others were not quite so happy. I there are others were not quite so happy, I am thinking of Greenpeace who have said that UNESCO has clearly shown the Great Barrier Reef is not defined and not safe in the hands of the Prime Minister, Tony Abbott. There is no doubt that we have sadly seen substantial coral loss in recent decades and nobody here is disputing that but what this draft decision does is give a big kick to the plans our government has put in place to stop that the client and to see improvement over time. The short and medium-term challenges to the reef are really about the impact of the port developed along the coast and the pollution runoff from the catchment and we have very strong plans to address both those short and medium-term threats. The resources along the northeastern coastline of Australia are well known and that is one of the real conflicts, isn’t it? Trying to protect the reef but wanting to do business with the likes of China? Certainly, in part this is a balancing act between those in Queens land who are employed in the tourist industry on the reef and those who work in the resources sector. What we believe we have done and the world heritage committee has endorsed with this draft decision is found the right balance. We have banned the dumping of capital spoil and greatly limited the number of ports that can be built along the coastline and that can be concentrated on the best locations and channels. We believe that especially on the front of the ports, this strikes the right balance between allowing economic development but protecting the reef for future generations. development but protecting the reef forfuture generations. We for future generations. We are talking substantial policies of money invested here and in a sense, being denied by the restrictions of the port building. You’re right. On one front, we are investing hundreds of millions of dollars, particularly in the water quality initiatives and in terms of what these restrictions will do, they will make these port expansions more expensive but we think we have struck the right balance. We think investment is worth it for the sake of the Great Barrier Reef. We take our custodianship of the reef very seriously. Dredging has been an issue in the mind of Greenpeace and they are very concerned about that and any spoiling of the seabed around the reef. That’s right. There is strong evidence that the dumping of dredged spoil at sea have an impact on the reef and that is why when of the first things we did was to stop the dumping of that capital dredged spoil offshore and we will be legislating that ban in a couple weeks. The United States’ Government has removed Cuba from its list of state sponsors of terrorism. The move removes a key obstacle to restoring diplomatic ties between the old enemies. The change allows Cuba to conduct banking in the United States, among other activities. From Havana, Will Grant reports. Although Cu ba Although Cuba ‘s removal from the blacklist had been expected for some weeks, when it finally came it was Dell another important moment in this long and complex bilateral relationship. In a businesslike announcement, the US government said, in essence, Cuba is no longer deemed a country that alters terrorism. We have issued this morning a statement about the rescission of Cuba ‘s status as a state sponsor of terrorism. It is effective today, May 29, 2015 and it reflects our assessment after undertaking a review that was requested by the president, our assessment that Cuba meets the statutory requirement for the decision. In Havana, the Cuban government has long argued that their inclusion on the list was an injustice in the first place. Not only do they not finance terrorism groups, government officials say but they have even been hosting peace talks between the left-wing level army in the Farc and the Colombian government in Havana. A view echoed hy government in Havana. A view echoed by many in the Cuban capital on the streets. TRANSLATION: How wonderful that they realised it. It is a bit late because most Cubans were born under the stigma that has nothing to do with us but this pleases me a lot and I am very happy about it. It is time that commercial ties be opened. Communications and other kinds of business and bilateral relations between two countries. Well a decision hasn’t been greeted with any great response from the Cuban government, for now there can be little doubt that President Ronald Castro will welcome the move. It’s a blog Cuba greater freedom in terms of international financial transactions -- it should help, which should help bolster its floundering economy and make good on the promise of the Obama and ministration to make it with Cuba. The process of reestablishing domestic ties with Cuba is moving at its own speed. While that might not be as quick as some had hoped, it will go a long way to repairing the broken relationship and now the two sides can look forward to opening joint embassies in the next two weeks. Millions of Mexicans go to the polls next weekend to cast their ballot in the country’s mid-term elections. However, the lead up so far has been plagued by assaults, kidnapping and even murder of candidates and campaign workers. There’s also been social unrest on the streets with groups calling for a boycott of the elections. Catharina Moh reports. Withjust over a With just over a week left Withjust over a week left in voting, the electoral process in Mexico has been marred by the violence and social unrest. Dozens of candidates and campaign workers have been killed, kidnapped and assaulted by criminal gangs who have failed to respect their interests. And in the capital, political propaganda burned on the streets. Demonstrators are calling for a boycott of the elections. They don’t have faith in the government and distrust the electoral process. It is eight months since the abduction and possible murder of 1+3 students from Guerrero state and many feel politicians have done little to find those responsible and tackle organised crime. This man shouts that the political parties have never been the answer to the needs of the people. In Guerrero state itself, protesters have constantly attacked itself, protesters have constantly attacked government buildings to show their dissatisfaction with what they called the corrupt political class. But some experts worry that boycotting the elections would damage the country. TRANSLATION: Everyone is saying don’t vote, don’t go and vote because of the violence but the question is, than what? We replace democracy with something else? What they want is an authoritarian regime, a popular system or a dictatorship. The midterm elections are shaping up to be difficult, notjust in Guerrero state but in areas dominated by drug cartels. Next week millions of Mexicans look past ballots to choose hundreds of state legislators as well as governors and the outcome will be a political weather gauge for the president. Next month sees the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo. The historic conflict which saw the defeat of Napoleon and the end to his ambitions to dominate Europe. All sorts of events will be taking place, including an exhibtion with a difference. Tim Allman explains. Napoleon crossing the Alps. One of the most iconic images of France ‘s famous Emperor General. But look closely. This portrait is not quite what it seems. In Waterloo, Napoleon did surrender, so the song goes and what better way to remember it than with Lego? Lots and lots of Lego. Around a million bits of Lego, in fact. There is Napoleon, his Empressjosephine, infantrymen and cavalry, a replica of the Imperial throne and even a version of his famous bi-corn hat. TRANSLATION: More than 20 people, modelers and builders, worked on the Waterloo exhibition usiing around 100 million building blocks representing around 1000 hours of construction work, particularly if you take the Castle of Malmaison. There were 20,000 bricks! The biggest project is Invalides Dome, burial site of Napoleon, two and a half metres high and weighing half a ton, it is made up of 300,000 Lego bricks. TRANSLATION: We wanted to do something for children who generally come with their parents and grandparents. This exhibition meet our expectations and provide a better understanding of the Battle of Waterloo for all generations. There is also a miniature Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel, celebrating some of the battles that Napoleon did win. The Emperor was apparently a man conscious of his diminutive stature, so it is not certain that he would have appreciated this. Headlines next. This is BBC News. Welcome to the weekend.

The latest headlines from BBC News. I’m Gavin Grey. The US Secretary of Defence has issued America’s strongest warning yet over the creation by China of new islands which it’s using to try to extend its sovereignty in the South China Sea. Ash Carter said the US is ‘deeply concerned’ and will ‘fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows.' Sepp Blatter has been re-elected president of football’s world governing body FIFA for a fifth term - despite separate US and Swiss criminal investigations into alleged Fifa corruption. Mr Blatter secured his tenure for another four years after his only rival withdrew after the first round of voting. The BBC has heard further allegations of the torture, rape and murder of Rohingya migrants from Myanmar. A BBC correspondent, who travelled to a camp formerly used by people traffickers in Malaysia, said people spoke of being detained, beaten, tortured and raped. Some were taken and never returned. Let’s have a quick look at some of the Saturday morning front pages. The Independent leads with claims that a violent robber was able to escape from a private prison by walking out of the door with a group of visitors. The Mail says patients who want to go abroad to be helped to end their own lives are being sent to a struck-off doctor for the approval they need. The Times leads on news that one in five cancer deaths is now caused by obesity, which doctors say is on track to overtake smoking as the main cause of the disease. The Mirror leads on the same story - it says more 300,000 people are year are dying because they are too fat. The Financial Times reports on pleas from the Treasury Secretary for a deal to be struck between Greece and its international creditors. The Express dedicates its front page to news that Britain’s £12 billion aid budget is to be protected from spending cuts - while defence suffers more cutbacks. The Telegraph reports that almost 900,000 people who filed late tax returns have been let off a £100 fine for missing the deadline. In a tale of corruption and international espionage for Our World, Wyre Davies investigates the suspicious death of Argentina’s leading prosecutor. There are some scenes viewers may find distressing. It’s the case that has gripped Argentina. Alberto Nisman was a special prosecutor investigating the country’s worst terror attack. Hours before he was due to testify in Congress, he was found dead at his luxury flat. Suicide or murder? After weeks without answers, come here to try to piece together Alberto Nisman’s final hours and ask the question who may have wanted him dead. His ex-wife spoke to us in an exclusive interview. And we question the man who may have been the last to see him alive. Did you know you had a gun? We look at the evidence and ask, who killed Alberto Nisman? The story begins 21 years ago on july the 18th, 1991+. A massive bomb destroyed the Amia, a jewish community centre in Buenos Aires, killing 85 people. This previously unseen footage, show now for the first time, shows the ensuing chaos. Rescuers ask, ""Is anyone there? Is she alive?"" As a young reporter, I came to Buenos Aires to cover the aftermath of the 1991+ attack. At that time, everyone I talked to was in shock. How could this happen here, in Argentina? Much of the evidence was lost or contaminated, either deliberately or through incompetence. No one has ever been convicted for the Amai bombing. Alberto Nisman, a 51-year-old prosecutor, had spent almost two decades investigating who was behind the Amai attack, trying to crack the case that no-one else could solve. He was a meticulous and driven man, but he would never finish his task. In an exclusive interview, Nisman’s ex-wife described how he told their eldest daughter that the work he was doing was dangerous, but that he had no choice. At this luxury apartment complex in Buenos Aires, Alberto Nisman was preparing to deliver a damning report, accusing the Argentine government of being involved in covering up the worst terror attack in the country’s history. Butjust hours before he was due to testify, Nisman was found dead, here in his 13th floor apartment, with a single gunshot wound to the head. Our investigation reveals new details about Nisman’s final hours. We examine evidence from the crime scene and talk to key figures. Did the prosecutor kill himself? If not, was he murdered by someone close to him? Or could he have been the victim of a power struggle in Argentina’s notorious secret services? How and why Alberto Nisman died is an intriguing but complex story. And one which may not end, even once the official report is released. While working on the Amai case, in recent months, Nisman had embarked on a parallel inquiry which made him enemies at the highest level. His body was discovered hours before he was due to present this second report to Congress, in which he accused the government of plotting with Iran to cover up the Amai government. Nisman trusted few people and often worked from his flat. It was here, on the 18th ofjanuary this year, that he was found dead. Apparently alone and with a handgun next to his body, many senior figures in Argentina immediately assumed Nisman had killed himself. Even President Fernandez de Kirchner speculated on her Facebook page what may have made him take his own life. But Sandra Arroyo Salgado, Nisman’s former partner, disputed the official version of events from the start. I knew it might break me, Nisman had said, just days before he died, admitting his accusations against the government would make him a marked man. At the time of his death, Sandra Arroyo Salgado was travelling abroad and, although they were separated, she returned home to the glare of the media. Let the investigation take its course, she said then. But appalled by the rapid speed of the autopsy and the failure to preserve evidence at the scene, Arroyo Salgado, a judge herself, began her own inquiries. Official images, obtained by the BBC, pointed to a shocking lapse of protocol and procedure at the flat where Nisman died. Several people, walking all over the scene and evidence improperly collected. The woman now in charge of the official investigation into Nisman’s death denied her office mishandled those initial hours at the scene. A public feud between two of Argentina’s highest profile female legal figures over key facts has captivated the country. It is believed that Viviana Fein’s official investigation will rule that Nisman killed himself. However, Sandra Arroyo Salgado’s investigators say the evidence suggests otherwise. Including the way that Nisman’s body was found after his death. Nisman was lying on his back in the bathroom, with the gun that killed him behind his left shoulder even though he was shot in the rear, right side of the head. One of Argentina’s leading crime reporters says that points more towards a possible assassination, a theory he says is supported by criminologists from Interpol. The weapon that killed Nisman, a .22 calibre Bersa handgun, belonged to a 38-year-old computer specialist who worked closely with the prosecutor- Diego Lagomarsino. In the chaotic press conference after the body was found, Lagomarsino denied being part of a conspiracy to kill his boss. Later, he told me his version of events, that Nisman asked him for the gun because he didn’t trust his police bodyguards. Did he know you had a gun? Did you feel you had no choice, you had to give him the gun? You seem quite angry. Is that a fair reflection? Lagomarsino says he took the gun to Nisman’s apartment on the Saturday evening and then left. But Sandra Arroyo Salgado says her investigators concluded that Nisman actually died on the same Saturday night. It all comes down to what happened in those critical 21+ hours between when Lagomarsino says he gave Nisman the gun, and when the body was found on the Sunday night. One important key to that period is the apparent lack of communication from Nisman after Saturday evening, rare for such a busy and work-obsessed man. What you are saying is if Alberto had been alive on Sunday morning, he would have been active, he would have been phoning people, he would have been contacting people. Instead, we asked to believe he was silent all day Sunday? The vast majority of Argentines share Arroyo Salgado’s suspicion and her scepticism that the case is being handled neither impartially nor independently. Exactly one month after Nisman’s body was found, hundreds of thousands marched in torrential rain across the capital protesting against impunity - the feeling that, yet again, another high-profile crime would inevitably go unsolved because ofjudicial incompetence and political interference. Alberto Nisman was laid to rest in a quiet corner of the Ta blada Cemetery. His grave, piled high with stones of remembrance. Our investigation revealed that Nisman was walking a fine line in his work on the Amia case and his accusations against the government. A number of people could have wanted him dead and he had received many threats against his life. Only a few metres away from Nisman was not grave lie those who were killed in the Amia bombing. They were victims of an attack on one of the largestjewish communities outside Israel and Alberto Nisman believed their memories were being betrayed by the Argentine government. 21 years later, a huge amount of evidence has been amassed, interviews, witness statements and wiretaps. Alberto Nisman spent 17 years working on this case. It was his life’s work. 500,000 files and audio tapes, gathering dust in a government warehouse. ""Escuchas"" - the Spanish word for wiretaps. This was among the evidence that in 2006 lead Nisman to formally accuse Iran and its ally, Hezbollah, of being behind the Amia attack. So when Argentina signed a deal with Iran in 2013, establishing a truth commission, ostensibly to start a joint investigation into the bombing, Nisman could not contain his anger. He felt betrayed and accused President Fernandez de Kirchner of acting unconstitutionally and illegally interfering in the judicial process. It was then, in a move that may have cost him his life, that he began the secret, parallel investigation, alleging the government was part of an elaborate cover-up. Argentina’s combative leader was having love it. In the weeks after Nisman’s death, she showed little public simply for the dead prosecutor’s family and was accused of rallying her own supporters to exacerbate the already deep divisions in Argentine society. She dismissed Nisman’s conclusions that she and her Foreign Minister Hector Timerman had illegally cooked up the deal with Iran to benefit Argentina financially. Foreign Minister Timerman who, like Nisman, isjewish, told me it was inconceivable that he would betray the memories of those who died in the Amia bombing. Although Nisman had even drafted an order of arrest for Timerman and the President, the Foreign Minister said Nisman’s allegations of a cover-up were baseless and the idea of arresting the President has already been rejected by the courts. Do you say that in this case you have done nothing wrong? You all the President? Nothing, nothing at all, on the contrary. We did more than any other government in order to find out who committed the terrible crime against the jewish centre. More than any other government. We know from leaked documents that Nisman was a regular visitor to the US Embassy in Buenos Aires. He saw secret intelligence briefings that probably influenced his investigation into the Amia bombing. He is also believed to have close links with the Israeli Mossad. After Nisman died, Hector Timerman sent open letters to Washington and Israel, warning them to back off the internal affairs of Argentina. I think that there are countries whose intelligence services operate in third countries without authorisation of those countries. What I am saying in my letter is just telling them that they are doing that, they should stop. Is this all coincidental? Are you sending me is warning letters to the Americans and Israelis because of what we have learned from the Nisman case? That is something I prefer not to answer. If I can push you slightly differently, do you have evidence that there were foreign agencies at work? We don’t send letters without evidence. But foreign spies were not the only shadowy figures in Nisman’s world. He also moved in dangerous circles much closer to home. From its headquarters overlooking the presidential palace, some say this is the real seat of power, Argentina’s Internal Intelligence Agency. For decades, its operations director was Antonio ""jaime"" Stiusso, a man so elusive that only one known picture of him exists. He worked closely with Alberto Nisman on the Amia case, feeding him wiretaps and other sensitive information. After Stiusso was suddenly sacked by the President in December, a possible theory was that Nisman could have been the victim of a power struggle between the government and an intelligence service not used to being challenged. The only person who can request a change to this... Argentine judge and international war crimes prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo says the power still wielded by military era spies has compromise the independence of the judicial system where Nisman worked. In the 70s and 80s, our intelligence system was part of the massive atrocities committed by the dictatorship. This is over. We stopped it and and we prosecuted the junta leader for that. The Nisman case exposed that the democratic government did not change the functioning of the intelligence system. Yes, they are no more committing massive atrocities. But the intelligence system is used to manage money for political purposes, to spy on opposition members, and to controljudges and prosecutors that want to investigate the government. So, that is what we have here. The Nisman case exposed that. Nisman was using the intelligence services, but he was also being used by them. Could this be the reason that he died? In a city full of secrets and suspicions, the one person that got really close to the prosecutor, and allegedly gave him the gun, was IT specialist Diego Lagomarsino. But was he also an intelligence agent and, as some have alleged, did he have a role in Nisman’s death? No, Lagomarsino told me, emphatically. His job was merely to look after the prosecutor’s computer needs. Alleging that Nisman was fond of a highlife, government ministers and insiders have gone to extraordinary lengths to is the prosecutor died to sully his character, accusing him of being a womaniser and even misappropriating from his office. The smear campaign against a man who valued reputation and image, and the obvious political context, leaves Nisman’s family feeling like the official investigation into his death is being deliberately manipulated. Did you feel there was an attempt by the state, by the authorities, to control things, from the very start, to leave you, as a family, outside? Alberto Nisman never got here to Congress to deliver his controversial report. It was criticised by many, but those who knew Nisman say he was convinced by the veracity of his work and was certainly not suicidal. But he is dead, and by the end of the year Argentina will have elected a new President and a different Congress. For the families of Alberto Nisman and the victims of the Amia bombing, hope is fading with time. To come back here two decades after the Amia bombing and see such little progress is galling. And it suggests that Argentina’s transformation into a fully functioning democracy is not yet complete. That the system has also failed a man who dedicated his life to investigating the Amia bombing is also a tragedy. The official investigation has still to rule on the cause of death, but few people here now believe this was a case of suicide. A complete loss of faith in that system means we may never know who killed Alberto Nisman. Welcome to the weekend. Disappointingly cool for the time of year. We will all see rain at some stage but it is not a washout of a weekend. Certainly a chilly start to Saturday morning, even rural ground frost in some places but Saturday offers not just a fine start but fine and dry weather for many of us throughout the day. Not wall-to-wall sunshine, some of us will have rather cloudy skies and there will be one or two showers in northern Scotland but as the day goes on, we will see the odd shower in eastern areas of England and the Midlands. At 1+:00pm there is a weather system approaching the south-west and south-west Wales and Northern Ireland and that comes in during the evening. At this stage most places are looking dry. There will be some sunny spells around Northern Ireland, it is not warm but the sun makes all the difference. If you are out of the breeze and in the sun it is not too bad. Northern Scotland will see one or two showers, the rest of Scotland sees a decent amount of sunshine as does much of northern England. The odd shower reaching part of the Midlands at this stage in the afternoon but the rest of England and much of Wales is seeing a lot of cloud and 16 degrees in London. Two Cup Final games in the world of football, the sunniest weather will be in Scotland but both are looking dry and it is a dry start to the weekend action at the cricket at Headingley but on Sunday, it is a different story. Let’s find out why. As we end Saturday, weather fronts are approaching so it will turn wet in the west over Saturday evening with a freshening wind and the UK through Headingley and for the rest of us as well. It would give many a wet and windy start to Sunday but bear with it because it will not wash out the whole day. It will get dry and eventually brighter although some may see a further shower. The rain will push away east on Sunday morning and eastern Scotland and England will keep it going into the afternoon. Following behind, it will brighten up slowly with a few showers in northern and western areas in particular. Monday and Tuesday does not look like spring or summer, it is more like autumn with this area of low pressure promising more rain and strong winds or gales but as we go through next week, the weather transforms from that very autumnal looking feel at the start of the week to something more settled and eventually more summerlike at the end of the week. Welcome to BBC News, broadcasting at home and around the globe, I’m Gavin Grey. Our top stories: The US Secretary of Defence issues America’s strongest warning yet over China’s activities in the South China Sea. Sepp Blatter is re-elected as president of Fifa, despite the charges of corruption against some of his officials. As thousands of Asian migrants continue their desperate journey, we have a special report from the Thai-Malaysia border. And, we join the fight against rabies following one charity as it tries to vaccinate dogs in Malawi. The United States has called for ""an immediate and lasting halt"" to reclamation works by all claimants in disputed waters in the South China Sea. Speaking in Singapore a short time ago, the US Defence Secretary Ashton Carter told China that its behaviour in the area was out of step with international norms and rules. Bill Hayton reports. Out in the middle of the South China Sea, China is creating land. It is turning nine coral reefs into naval bases. Two of them will have major runways. In their natural state, most of these features would be under water, which means they don’t count as territory under international law. So the US has begun operations to challenge China’s claims, flying planes close to the new bases. The American defence secretary has called on China to stop what it is doing. There should be an immediate and lasting halt to land reclamation by all claimants. We also oppose any further militarisation of disputed features. He also made clear the US will push back attempts to prevent its ships and planes using the sea. There should be no mistake, the US will fly, sale and operate wherever international law allows, as US forces do all over the world. Those policies have already provoked criticism from Beijing. TRANSLATION: We urge the US, which is not a party to the South China Sea dispute, to take a responsible attitude. Be prudent in words and deeds, be reasonable and calm, and stop making provocative remarks. Other countries around provocative remarks. Other countries around the South China Sea are stepping up their cooperation in the face of China’s moves. Earlier this week, Vietnamese and Philippine troops took place in their first ever day of sporting activities. A piece of fun but with a serious purpose. But the US and China look determined to stand their ground, but for now the clashes will be confined to the hotel ballroom. Sepp Blatter has been re-elected president of FIFA for a fifth term, despite allegations of rampant corruption inside of football’s world governing body. Mr Blatter secured another four years after his only rival, Prince Ali bin al-Hussein ofjordan, withdrew. In his acceptance speech, Mr Blatter said he took full responsibility for restoring Fifa’s reputation. More from our Sports reporter, Richard Conway. SePP Sepp Blatter survives, at least for now. Despite the worst crisis in Fifa’s history, the 79-year-old confounded his opponents once again and secured a fifth consecutive term of office. Speaking to delegates after his rival, Prince Ali, withdrew from the contest, he pledged to restore trust in the governing body. Ithank pledged to restore trust in the governing body. I thank you so much, I thank you for the trust and confidence. Trust and confidence together we go. Let’s go, Fifa! Prompted by the arrest of seven football officials on Wednesday morning, Uefa believes change is now crucial if Fifa is to regain any credit ability. The Football Association chairman, Greg Dyke, Football Association chairman, Greg Dyke, a leading backer of Sally’s campaign, thinks step later received a shock. This isn’t over by any means. These events have been so dramatic for Fifa that! means. These events have been so dramatic for Fifa that I cannot see Fifa reforming itself under Blatter. He has had 16 years and he hasn’t done that. Despite that triumph, Sepp Blatter knows the spectre of further arrest and accusations still remains. The FBI insists their enquiries are onlyjust beginning. More than 700 migrants have been rescued off the south coast of Myanmar. News of the rescue comes as regional representatives meet in Thailand to address the crisis. Thousands of migrants, many of them persecuted Rohingya Muslims, are at the mercy of people traffickers. Once on dry land, they are imprisoned and held for ransom. Our international correspondent, Ian Pannell, has been to Thai-Malaysia border. His report contains disturbing first hand testimony. The wild borderlands of Malaysia. Where migrant dreams of a promised land didn’tjust vanish in the mist, they were crushed into the ground. Rohingya Muslims fled persecution in Myanmar and were brought to these camps. But the men who promised to save them held them hostage instead. They were beaten, tortured, raped and many were killed. We’re in the deepjungle on the Malaysian-Thai border. This is the area that holds the darkest of secrets. There are more than 1+0 camps believed to be in this area and I’m standing in one of them. It’s very makeshift. There are bits of wood tied together, makeshift shelters, very little to protect people. Some people were kept in these areas for as long as two years. There are more than 1+0 camps like this believed to be hidden in these woods. Nearly 11+0 bodies have been recovered and the prediction is that there could be hundreds more buried somewhere in thisjungle. We met some of those held in these camps. Abdul Hakim staggered out of the jungle this week with just a pair of shorts to his name. He had been held for an astonishing two years in the jungle. As the police closed in, the traffickers fled and the migrants escaped. Abdul Hakim has the face of a haunted man. He was starved, beaten and tortured. TRANSLATION: At the end of this month I would have been two years in this camp. We couldn’t pay the ransom money so we were tortured and kept there. They poured boiling oil on us. Sometimes the traffickers hanged people. A lot of people died and the place was covered with graves. A lot of people died. And the memories will be with them forever. Rashida loves her baby daughter but the little girl will always remind her of the jungle camps where she was raped by so many men that she doesn’t know who Ayisha’s father is. TRANSLATION: They beat and killed the boys and raped the girls who couldn’t give them money. Life is really bad in Myanmar and we can’t survive there. That’s why we left. But it’s hard to survive here, too. When we go out the police take money from us and sometimes we are arrested. We thought Malaysia would be better but it’s the same. So Rashida lives in the shadows with other migrants, fleeing hardships at home, risking journeys at sea, and suffering the horrors of the jungle camps - and for what? They’re non-people in their promised land. For those who survived the camps there is neither dignity nor hope. Rashida must beg on a bridge with her baby and other migrants from Myanmar, just to survive. Malaysia doesn’t class them as refugees. The UN stopped giving them papers and has failed to help her. They have endured the worst humanity can sink to. And yet still no-one sees them, and no-one wants them. The German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, has said she wants to play a constructive role as David Cameron tries to renegotiate Britain’s relationship with the EU. Standing alongside the Prime Minister in Berlin, at the end of his diplomatic tour of Europe, she also left open the possibility that reforms could lead to changes being made to the treaties which underpin the EU. More from our deputy political editor, james Landale. In Berlin today they pulled out all the stops. Guards of honour, yards of red carpet, and a warm hug and a kiss. He doesn’t get this everywhere. But this was not just a display of German respect for a newly elected PM, it was also the continent’s most powerful politician extending the hand of friendship towards a leader she wants in lockstep, not just with her, but also the rest of Europe. So, after a quick lunch, Chancellor Merkeljoined David Cameron before the cameras and suggested she could do a deal with her guest over his plans to reform the European Union. TRANSLATION: We want to work closely together in the process that the UK is now going through towards a referendum. We would like to help in a constructive way. As I’ve said before, where there’s a will, there’s a way. And that’s quite something to say when Mr Cameron wants to cut migrants’ benefits, opt Britain out of ever closer union and give national parliaments new powers to block EU laws. What chance do you believe that David Cameron has in achieving his reforms, given the opposition that you and so many other leaders have towards the treaty changes that he’s seeking? TRANSLATION: If you are convinced of an idea, you can’t say that treaty change is an absolute impossibility. To a PM who has been told no so often, this, perhaps, WGS VâI’y WâlCO!T!â. I was very heartened by what the Chancellor said in terms of where there’s a will, there’s a way. If content requires changes in treaties, then you can’t let that stand in the way of what needs to be done. What Europe needs to be, it needs to have the flexibility of a network, not the rigidity of a bloc. Earlier, the mood in Poland was less positive. Mr Cameron and the Polish PM agreed the EU needed to be more competitive. But she told him of her strong disagreement with any benefit cuts that might discriminate against Polish nationals in Britain. If we are talking about imposing certain solutions that are going to divide European citizens, and some of the proposals could be read in this way, then obviously we would be against. David Cameron’s aim on this grand tour of Europe is to make sure that when the negotiations begin in earnest at a summit next month, everybody understands Britain’s position. But, as he found out today, getting everybody to agree to that position is quite another thing. james Landale, BBC News, in Berlin. The US defence Secretary, Ash Carter, has called on China to stop building naval installations in the South China Sea. He was speaking at a conference in Singapore, from where we can now cross live to jonathan Marcus. Happy these comments go down? Widely supported, although it should be remembered that many cultures, notjust China, are trying to build these places in the sea, but China is doing it on a much faster scale than anyone else. I think broad support for the idea that should be done diplomatically, legal challenges should be posed rather than physical military challenges,... It rather than physical military challenges,... It has been disputed that this was not constructive criticism, and clearly a Washington and Beijing are not going to see eye to eye. This whole issue has been bumbling underfour to eye. This whole issue has been bumbling under four years. It seems it will be no more likely to be sorted out. It doesn’t. Words between the Chinese and Americans at this same conference last year, and in the last few months, Chinese island building has intensified dramatically. They are doing it much more than anyone else, 2000 acres of land have been reclaimed over the last two years alone, and what they are doing is building airfields, installations, surveillance centres and so on, and that is something that many countries in the region find extremely threatening. Stay with us on BBC News, still to come: Troubled times for Mexican democracy - how violence and harassment has marred the country’s mid-term election campaign. Let’s see what’s been making headlines around the world, with a look at the international papers. We start with Gulf News, which leads on one of our top stories, the re-election of FIFA president Sepp Blatter. He won his fifth term of office when Prince Ali Bin Al Hussain ofjordan conceded defeat after losing in the first round of votes. Ajubilant Mr Blatter can be seen on the front of the Financial Times. His election follows a torrid week for football’s world governing body and the indictment of numerous officials on corruption charges. Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post leads on a health scare in the territory. 18 people have been put under quarantine after coming into contact with a Korean man believed to be suffering from the MERS virus. Staying in the region, and China Daily says the government is to step up its efforts to combat the illegal trade in ivory. Nearly 700kg of confiscated ivory were destroyed by officials in Beijing on Friday. This is BBC News. I’m Gavin Grey. The latest headlines: The US Defence Secretary has issued America’s strongest warning yet over Beijing’s activities in the disputed waters in the South China Sea. Sepp Blatter has been re-elected president of Fifa, despite being at the helm during one of the biggest corruption scandals to rock world football. Every day across the world over a hundred children die from rabies. The virus almost always proves fatal once symptoms begin to show. Reports have concluded that the easiest and most cost effective way to stop its spread is by vaccinating enough dogs, and one charity is doing just that. Mission Rabies started their campaign in India and are now moving onto Malawi, as Lizzie Crouch reports. In Malawi, like many countries, dogs are Redman’s or even a child’s best friend. But these pets are harbouring a hidden menace, rabies. Here in Blantyre, there is the highest number of babies dying from rabies. This family’s puppies were written by a rabid dog. They struck at anything that came near them, that made the parents worried. They had headaches, severe backpain. They looked weak and lost their appetite. Luckily the children weren’t infected, as once a dog or a human starts to show symptoms of rabies, it is too late, they will likely die. But postexposure rabies vaccine is in short supply here. Action is needed to tackle this crisis. Most human cases of rabies result from being bitten by an infected dog. So mass campaigns like this one here that aim to vaccinate dogs throughout communities are key to eradicating this redoubtable disease. The idea is that if enough dogs are protected from rabies, then more dogs and more importantly people will be protected to. It is called herd immunity. Usually, they will be a certain number of individuals that are infected by each affected animal. For rabies, each rabid log might actually only infectjust each rabid log might actually only infect just over infectjust over one other. -- dogs. It does not spread like a huge outbreak, butjust slowly in the population. By vaccinating 70%, the chance of a dog biting a vaccinated dog is greater than unvaccinated dog. That is how the disease runs out. Mission Rabies is hoping to vaccinate up to 1+0,000 dogs in the first month. As each dog is vaccinated, they answer key information into a smartphone at. This will keep track of the dogs vaccinated and provide data on the rabies situation in the city. This type of mass vaccination programme has already proven effective in India. Our programme in India has been running for nearly two years now. And we are starting to see the crease in the instance of canine rabies in the areas we are working in. -- see a decrease. In north India where we began the programme hy India where we began the programme by picking up a rabid dog each month, now in the last five months have only picked up two. There is already 80 crease those cases and we hope by the end of next year we are seeing very few if at all. -- a decrease. 99% of cases in India are from dog bites. If we see no more rabies cases in dogs we will see no more in humans either. This vaccination programme isjust vaccination programme is just getting vaccination programme isjust getting started. It is hoped that these efforts, along with better education, will reduce the number of people dying from rabies. The United States’ Government has removed Cuba from its list of state sponsors of terrorism. The move removes a key obstacle to restoring diplomatic ties between the old enemies. The change allows Cuba to conduct banking in the United States, among other activities. From Havana, Will Grant reports. Although Cuba’s removal from the blacklist had been expected for some weeks, when it finally came it was still another important moment in this long and complex bilateral relationship. In a businesslike announcement, the US government said that, in essence, Cuba is no longer deemed a country that sponsers terrorism. We have issued this morning a statement about the rescission of Cuba’s designation as a state sponsor of terrorism. It is effective today, May 29, 2015 and it reflects our assessment, after undertaking a review that was requested by the president, our assessment that Cuba meets the statutory criteria for the recision. In Havana, the Cuban government has long argued that their inclusion on the list was an injustice in the first place. Not only do they not finance terrorism groups, government officials say, but they have even been hosting peace talks between the left-wing rebel army, the Farc and the Colombian government in Havana. A view echoed by many in the Cuban capital on the streets. TRANSLATION: How wonderful that they realised it. It is a bit late because most Cubans were born under the stigma that has nothing to do with us but this pleases me a lot and I am very happy about it. It is time that commercial ties be opened. Communications and other kinds of business and bilateral relations between two countries. While the decision hasn’t been greeted with any great response from the Cuban government, for now there can be little doubt that President Raul Castro will welcome the move. It should allow Cuba greater freedom in terms of international financial transactions, which should help bolster its faltering economy and it shows a willingness from the Obama administration to make good on its promise to do business with Cuba. In President Castro’s own words, the process of reestablishing domestic ties with Cuba is moving at its own speed. While that might not be as quick as some would have liked, the decision to remove Cuba from the blacklist will go a long way to repairing the broken relationship and now the two sides can look forward to re-opening embassies in the coming weeks. Mexicans go to the polls next weekend to cast their ballot in the country’s mid-term elections. However, the lead up so far has been plagued by assaults, kidnapping and even murder of candidates and campaign workers. There’s also been social unrest on the streets with groups calling for a boycott of the elections. Catharina Moh reports. Withjust over a week left in voting, the electoral process in Mexico has been marred by violence and social unrest. Dozens of candidates and campaign workers have been killed, kidnapped and assaulted by criminal gangs who have failed to respect their interests. And in the capital, political propaganda burned on the streets. Demonstrators are calling for a boycott of the elections. They don’t have faith in the government and distrust the electoral process. It is eight months since the abduction and possible murder of 1+3 students from Guerrero state and many feel politicians have done little to find those responsible and tackle organised crime. This man shouts that the political parties have never been the answer to the needs of the people. In Guerrero state itself, protesters have constantly attacked government buildings to show their dissatisfaction with what they called the corrupt political class. But some experts worry that boycotting the elections would damage the country. TRANSLATION: Everyone is saying don’t vote, don’t go and vote because of the violence but the question is, then what? We replace democracy with something else? What they want is an authoritarian regime, a populist system or a dictatorship. The midterm elections are shaping up to be tense, notjust in Guerrero state but in areas dominated by drug cartels. Next weekend millions of Mexicans will cast ballots to choose hundreds of federal and state legislators as well as nine governors. The outcome will also be a political and social indicator for President Pena Nieto who had pledged to bring stability to the country. Next month sees the two-hundredth anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo. The historic conflict which saw the defeat of Napoleon, and the end to his ambitions to dominate Europe. All sorts of events will be taking place, including an exhibtion with a difference. Tim Allman explains. Napoleon crossing the Alps. One of the most iconic images of France ‘s famous Emperor General. But look closely. This portrait is not quite what it seems. In Waterloo, Napoleon did surrender, so the song goes and what better way to remember it than with Lego? Lots and lots of Lego. Around a million bits of Lego, in fact. There is Napoleon, his Empressjosephine, infantrymen and cavalry, a replica of the Imperial throne and even a version of his famous bi-corn hat. TRANSLATION: More than 20 people, modelers and builders, worked on the Waterloo exhibition usiing around 100 million building blocks representing around 1000 hours of construction work, particularly if you take the Castle of Malmaison. There were 20,000 bricks! The biggest project is Invalides Dome, burial site of Napoleon, two and a half metres high and weighing half a ton, it is made up of 300,000 Lego bricks. TRANSLATION: We wanted to do something for children who generally come with their parents and grandparents. This exhibition meet our expectations and provide a better understanding of the Battle of Waterloo for all generations. There’s also a miniature Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel, celebrating some of the battles that Napoleon did win. The Emperor was apparently a man conscious of his diminutive stature, so it is not certain that he would have appreciated this. This is BBC News. Welcome to the weekend.

A 1+7-year-old man has been detained indefinitely under the mental health act after starting a number of fires in Oxfordshire, including one which destroyed an entire council headquarters. Andrew Main admitted starting the fires at the offices as well as at a neighbour’s cottage and a funeral parlour. From Oxford Crown Court, Duncan Kennedy reports. just watch the lights on the left. This is a ram-raid on a council office in Oxfordshire. And this is 1+7-year-old Andrew Main, his aim not to steal, but to set the place alight. He walks away, his car now on fire. A few minutes later, he returns and there’s an explosion. That’s because there’s a gas canister in the car, and he’s set it alight. A few moments later, the fire starts to spread and the offices are engulfed. This was the inferno that followed, gutting the entire building. It took nearly 200 firefighters to control it, with the cost of repairs put at nearly £20 million. Andrew Main admitted causing the fire. The court heard he’s bipolar, but that there was no clear motive why he’d done it. It was one of four fires he started that night last january. He also lit a blaze at this thatched cottage in Roke Marsh near Oxford. Inside at the time was the owner, 80-year-old jean Gladstone. The court heard that, without a smoke alarm, she would have been killed. She says she can’t forget the night her home burned down. There was smoke everywhere and it was not difficult breathing but it was a funny sensation and then I thought, ""I think we’re on fire."" I don’t know why I thought so, because I’m sure I didn’t see a flame. And so I went to the other end of the house to my drawing room and phoned up the police. On that same night, Main also set light to this funeral parlour, a few metres away from the council office he later destroyed. At all three locations, gas canisters, including this one, were found by police and are believed to have been the propellant for the fires. The judge said no-one will ever know why Main lit all these fires, but that the consequences were utterly, utterly devastating. He ordered that Main be sectioned indefinitely under the Mental Health Act for what he called ""these motiveless crimes of an enormous nature"". It is amazing what some people will do to avoid eating by themselves, but what other concessions to South Koreans have these days? -- obsessions. South Korea’s signature cherry blossom and returns to the land of the morning calm. But right now, this is a restless country, where traditional values are being challenged.

Finally, up towards the mountains to find out how South Korea is determined its own martial art will kick kung fu and karate out of sight. Seoul, the capital of South Korea, is a teeming city, home to more than 11 million people. That is nearly a quarter of the country’s population. It is also the hub of an amazing economic transformation that began after the horrors inflicted began after the horrors on amazing economic transformation that began after the horrors on it in the Second World War. The story of South Korea goes back thousands of years, the country always fighting off outside pressure to preserve its own identity. After partition in 191+8, then invasion two years later from the north, the USA stepped in smartly in the first significant Cold War conflict. Today, the American influence on popular culture and consumerism is impossible to ignore. Decades of mind-boggling modernisation have led to South Korea enjoying way faster internet connectivity than the rest of the world, and that affect us all aspects of everyday life, like shopping.

This man is a film director, who after 15 years in New York has returned to a very different motherland. Status and glamour are very much part of the new scene here, but he sees deeper, more significant changes in modern-day South Korea. When! more significant changes in modern-day South Korea. When I was in the West, people talk about the decline of Western civilisation, about the death of cinema, the death of everything. Here, we are looking at a rosy future, and I love that sense of optimism here. While he was making films in the US, South Korea was exporting its own brand of film, soap operas and music to the rest of the world as part of a popular culture movement. It has been successful, but not to everyone’s taste. In recent years, Korea has become well- known for taste. In recent years, Korea has become well-known for a become well- known for a very heavily manufactured kind of music called kapok. However, there is another contemporary art form in which this country is genuinely a world leader. -- K-Pop. Breakdancing originated in urban American communities in the 1980s, on the streets of New York. In recent times, it has been adopted more eagerly by South Koreans. This crew are now recognised as one of the world’s best. Korean people are known for being very technical, they do a lot of difficult moves. They became very famous for that. This crew consist of 11+ members, half of whom are full-time and teach dance as well. Today, this is more than just a dance fad, it is an art form thatis just a dance fad, it is an art form that is constantly evolving, and thatis that is constantly evolving, and that is attracting people from all around the world to come and witness at first hand. So, how does it fit into the K-Pop scene, for which South Koreans have become so well- known? South Koreans have become so well-known? We started making South Koreans have become so well- known? We started making this culture with K-Pop. Personally, I don’t really see that as Korean culture. It isjust don’t really see that as Korean culture. It is just pure entertainment. Somehow we found a way to tease people overseas with his entertainment business. K-Pop, for us, ultimately it is a business. They sell music. On the other hand, we are not really trying to sell this, we think it is for everyone to be shared. This is one, two. This crew are like a tight family, and social bonds like these are beginning to replace the traditional family unit. The at session with achieving high career status has also pushed family down the list of priorities for many of the younger generation. We live in a very confusing time. I think the older generation still believe in community and family, but now that unit is somewhat collapsing. A lot of young kids in now living alone. The old-fashioned family units may be under threat, but what about communal dining? Food remains very central to the Korean way of life. Let’s face it, we all like someone to share a meal with, don’t we? Well, here they think they have come UP Well, here they think they have come up with the answer to that. Some people label it food porn. This woman is a music teacher, 28 years old and living with her parents and elder sister in an apartment on the outskirts of Seoul.

One day I found said they were interesting. One day Ifound myself watching it said they were interesting. One day I found myself watching it all through the night, then my sister asked me why I was watching it. She said, you like to cook and eat a lot, why did you do the programme? -- why don’t you. So she did. Now, four nights a week she broadcasts online to lonely viewers who have an instant pop up dining partner. Sometimes she cooks arrive up, sometimes she orders a takeaway, sometimes it is boat. After all, there is four hours of airtime to fill every night. It is 15 minutes before tonight’s transmission starts. She is not the only one doing this, around the country thousands of others are about to host similar shows. She ever wonder why it has become so popular? TRANSLATION: I think it is mainly to get vicarious satisfaction. Any people are on a diet in Korea, so they get satisfaction from watching someone it.

Do you think in a way it is a kind of therapy for some people? Yes, some say they are depressed, but! therapy for some people? Yes, some say they are depressed, but I make them feel better and cheer them up. While South Korea grapples with the consequences of its rapid transformation, shadows from its past refused to go away. Drive north from saw and you find a large looming legacy. We are less than 20 kilometres from the border between North and South Korea. Not so long ago, these peaceful surroundings were the scenes of tremendous military aggression from both sides. 1+ million people died in a short but brutal war here between the two sides. Today, there is a buffer zone, four kilometres wide and 21+0 kilometres long, cutting Korea in half along the 38 parallel. It is one of the eerie as places on Earth, and rather bizarrely, one of the world’s most popular tourist attractions. They even have a theme park dedicated to it.

I have met a lot of young people on this trip and they seem confident about the future of their country.

We will all see rain at some stage but it is not a washout of a weekend. Certainly a chilly start to Saturday morning, even rural ground frost in some places but Saturday offers not just a fine start but fine and dry weather for many of us throughout the day. Not wall-to-wall sunshine, some of us will have rather cloudy skies and there will be one or two showers in northern Scotland but as the day goes on, we will see the odd shower in eastern areas of England and the Midlands. It does not wash out the whole day. Things will turn dry and bright. Cool and breezy again but it will turn brighter from the West as the day turns on. Than cool and wet showers. ~ Hello, this is Breakfast, with Sian Lloyd and Charlie Stayt. Nearly a million people will be let off fines for filing their tax returns late.

186,BBC1 London,30-may-2015,BBC Weekend News,12:00,10 mins,True,"Good afternoon. The president of world football’s governing body, Fifa, Sepp Blatter accused the US authorities and the European Football Association, Uefa, for conducting what he called a ""hate campaign"" against him and his organisation. In his first press conference since he was elected president, Mr Blatter faced a barrage of questions about corruption in his organisation. Yet another classic performance from the man who has been called the great survivor, Sepp Blatter, here beginning his fifth term as Fifa president, surrounded by well-wishers. Today, he faced the world’s media. He has blamed them for exaggerating problems. All this happened on your watch. Do you accept it is time to go and why did this happen during your watch? The Congress are still of the opinion that I am the man to go into these problems and to solve these problems. The arrests of senior international football officials in Zurich this week seem almost forgotten. Mr Blatter has even told Swiss television he thinks it is all a conspiracy on the part of America Hangeland, because their World Cup bids failed. That allegation is dismissed by a Swiss prosecutors -- America and England. Last Wednesday was the perfect timing because so many people were physically present in Switzerland in one place, and that enabled us to bring in as much as information at the same time. Sepp Blatter says he wants to concentrate on Fifa’s future now. There isjust one not small problem, Fifa’s future contains two major criminal investigations into corruption, bribery and money-laundering. The truth is, Sepp Blatter may be President, but they seriously damaged and deeply divided organisation. It will take more than the confidence of a 79-year-old man to rescue Fifa. Our correspondent image and fix is in Zurich for us now. -- Our correspondent image and fix is in Zurich for us now. -- Imogen Foulkes. An extremely hostile line of questioning for Sepp Blatter? Absolutely, Sepp Blatter is always using nautical metaphors, sailing the ship back into calmer waters. Today he was surrounded by media sharks. He was asked again and again about corruption, asked openly, are you corrupt? Did you slyly give someone $10 million? Well, Mr Blatter was Mr Blatter, he just cruised right along above it. He is confident he is back in powerfor a fifth term. Caesar, now faces some very big problems. Thank you. -- Fifa now faces some very big problems. A 16-year-old boy has appeared in court accused of murdering a man and a woman in Colchester. Saudi student, Nahid Almanea, was stabbed as she walked to the University of Essex last june. james Attfield, who was 33, was found with more than 100 knife wounds in March 2014. The boy, who cannot be named due to his age, entered no plea at the hearing at Chelmsford Magistrates’ Court. Hundreds of thousands of people who failed to complete and file their tax returns have been told they will not have to pay a fine, as long as they have a ""reasonable excuse"". HMRC has said it wants to focus its resources ""on investigating major tax avoidance and evasion"". Our business correspondentjoe Lynam is here. joe, what exactly are the tax authorities saying? This applies to self-assessment tax returns who have defiled their files by january the 31st. Ordinarily, they would face a fine of £100 if they had -- they would face a fine of £100 if they had -- unless you have a reasonable excuse which would be the death of a partner, staying in hospital or your software crashing on the day you are filing your tax return. If you have not filed it by now then you will face a fine. Margaret Hodge has been vocal about the big tax aggressive avoidance schemes so not everyone is pleased with the new Wallasey by HMRC. People filing tax returns will be pleased. -- the new policy. Cancer specialists have welcomed the result of a trial of a new lung cancer treatment, which has more than doubled the life expectancy of some patients. The drug, Nivolumab, makes it harder for the cancer to hide from the body’s immune system. Here’s our health reporter james Gallagher. Lung cancer is a killer. Around the world, nearly 1.6 million people die from it annually. That is more than from any other type of tumour. And treatments are lacking. Our body’s own defences, our immune system, can kill some cancerous tissues. But tumours are cunning, and can get into cells and turn them off. Nivolumab stops that from happening and allows the body to fight back. The trial took place on 582 people with late stage lung cancer. Those getting standard treatment lived for nine months. But with Nivolumab, life was extended to 12 months. Some lived longer than 19 months, they were the people whose tumours were exceptionally good at turning off the immune system. For lung cancer patients, it offers a great new hope for a new treatment. That could be with us very soon. We need to work out why some patients responded very well to the treatment and others don’t. The more we can find out about how we can increase the amount of patients it will benefit, the better. But it offers hope where, at the moment, there are few options. But these therapies are likely to be very expensive, and that will pose a big question for health services trying to fund them. You can see more on all of today’s stories on the BBC News Channel.

As for the cricket, it should be dry and bright at Headingley. Potentially if delayed start. Why? Because the cloud we saw earlier on the satellite picture will bring rain through this evening. The rain means it will not be as cold tonight but it will be a pretty grey and dismal start to Sunday with blustery conditions as well. The winds chase the rain away so for most places it will brighten up through the day. The wind lingers in East Anglia. Elsewhere, it brightens up with some afternoon sunshine.

Full-blown joy for Arsene Wenger, Good evening. Sepp Blatter has brushed aside any suggestion he may be arrested as part of a US corruption investigation. Appearing at his first news conference since re-election as the head of world football’s governing body FIFA, he was forced to deny authorising an alleged $10 million bribe. Earlier Mr Blatter condemned what he described as a ""hate"" campaign against FIFA by Europe’s football authorities. Our Sports Editor, Dan Roan reports now from Zurich. He may have been celebrating surviving the biggest crisis in Fifa’s history, but as he faced the media, Sepp Blatter discovered scrutiny of his leadership had not gone away. Fifa’s reputation is at an all-time low with two criminal investigations into bribery and corruption totalling $150 million and it has all happened on your watch. Why was it not time for you to go for the sake of football? It is very easy seeing the results of the Congress yesterday. They asked the opinion that I am still the man to go into this programme and solve this progress. This week US led arrests plunged Fifa into turmoil, but having swept to victory in yesterday’s election, the accused people of conducting a hate campaign against him, dismissing ideas that he could be brought into the investigations. Are you concerned at some stage you might be arrested? Arrested for what? And what about an alleged $10 million bribe paid to jack Warner, authorised by senior Fifa officials? Was it you? It definitely was not me. Is that incompetence or intentional negligence? The only thing I can say is know to both. At Wembley the focus return to the sport itself with the FA Cup final. England’s governing body was left to display its dismay at yesterday’s result. He will not be able to rule a fundamentally corrupt organisation because he is part of it. If you are either captain of the ship and the ship is sinking, you should go. He should have resigned. The night FA president Prince William added his voice to calls for reform of world football’s governing body. These are challenging times for Fifa’s newly re-elected president who appeared intense and rattled this morning, but at the end of an unprecedented week the 79-year-old remains in power. Serious challenges remain. Damage relations with sponsors have to be repaired and there is still the possibility of a European boycott of the World Cup and the authorities have warned of further charges in their bribery investigation. Sepp Blatter may still be here, but his grip on power has never felt so divisive or perhaps precarious. The Italian coastguard says more than 4,000 migrants have been rescued from the Mediterranean Sea in the past 24 hours, with the Royal Navy warship HMS Bulwark helping with the operation.

At dawn this morning this group came ashore on the Greek island of cause, punching their flimsy inflatable, before walking off in the hope of a new life in Europe. A 16-year-old boy has appeared in court accused of murdering a man and a woman in separate attacks in Colchester. Nahid Almanea was stabbed as she walked to the University of Essex lastjune, while james Attfield, who was 33, was found with more than a hundred knife wounds in an attack three months earlier. The boy, who cannot be named because of his age, entered no plea at the hearing at Chelmsford Magistrates’ Court.

Hundreds of thousands of people who filed their tax returns late have been told they won’t have to pay fines as long as they have a ""reasonable excuse"". HMRC says it wants to focus its resources on investigating major tax avoidance and evasion. Here’sjoe Lynam. After working all week why not treat yourself to a day out at the markets? Around 10 million of us filed a self assessment tax return last year, but some of us did not file on time. Being told that the taxman would be coming after you for being late might be the icing on the cake and a few at this market had any issues with it. I think it is a great idea going after tax evaders, it is the way forward. It is a very sensible move, if they do not have the staff because of the economy, go after the bigger fish. Evasion is unacceptable, but do it from the top down. I think they should go for big businesses or companies that are avoiding it purposefully rather than people who have made a mistake and not done the tax return. Staffing levels at HMRC have been cut in half in the last decade and they have been asked to maximise the money that they get in. So, what they are doing is focusing now on the big fish, the big tax avoiders and the big tax evaders and they are spending a lot more time on them and not on people who file late. But Margaret Hodge, the former Labour chairman of the Public Accounts Committee and scourge of the Internet giants regarding their taxes said not pursuing those who filed late could bring the rules into disrepute. Some former tax inspectors SOITIE ‘fOI’ITIâIâ tax iI’ISpâCtoI’S BQFEE. SOITIE ‘fOI’ITIEIâ tax iI’ISpECtoI’S BQFEE. REVENUE i’13VE to EI’1COUI’3gE pEoplE Some former tax inspectors agree. Revenue have to encourage people to file their returns and if you say there is £100 fine and then a few months later they tell them to let people off, that is not fair. The Conservative government has promised to raise an additional £5 billion by clamping down further on tax avoidance. HMRC will have to do this with the same number or even fewer staff in future. In football Arsenal have won the FA Cup after beating Aston Villa 4-0 at Wembley, the biggest winning margin for 20 years. Arsenal have lifted the trophy more times than any other club. Ina week club. In a week that saw football dragged through the mud, a reminderat Wembley that playing the game is still a childhood dream. Aston Villa’s season had once looked more like a nightmare, but Tim Sherwood has taken them from relegation threats to the FA Cup final. Defence has not been their strong suit, and Arsenal quickly piled under pressure. His last FA final appearance 17 years ago, Shay Given’s reaction was timely. Even so, Villa fans were beginning to feel that defence would crumple and they were right to feel nervous. Theo Walcott was up front and had a point to prove. They say it is the hope that kills you, but for a villa it was a bullet courtesy of Alexis Sanchez. And if the sweetest of strikes broke their spirits, the easiest of headers broke their hearts. His side were well beaten. Olivier Giroud added the final icing to the cake, to see him equalled the record is the most successful manager in the history of the world’s oldest cup. Natalie Perks, BBC News. And in Scotland Inverness Caledonian Thistle have won the Scottish Cup after beating Falkirk 2-1 at Hampden. They went ahead in the first half but conceded an equaliser after going down to ten men. james Vincent then scored the winner in the 86th minute to earn Inverness their first major trophy, in their 21 year history.

Sepp Blatter accuses US prosecutors of attempting to engineer his downfall, with their anti-corruption arrests at FIFA. The newly re-elected head of world football is asked if he personally authorised a multi-million dollar bribe. Are you concerned at some stage you might be arrested? Arrested for what? Next question. There’s a new surge in the number of migrants crossing the Mediterranean. 4,000 have been rescued injust one day. And Arsenal put four past Aston Villa, for an historic win at Wembley. They lift the FA Cup for a record 12th time. Good evening. Sepp Blatter has accused American prosecutors of acting in bad faith, and of trying to engineer his downfall, in their anti-corruption investigation into FIFA. Today, Mr Blatter faced questions from journalists following his re-election as head of football’s world governing body. He dismissed suggestions that he might face arrest, and denied he personally authorised a $10 million bribe. Tonight Prince William, the President of the English FA, has called for reform at FIFA. Our sports editor, Dan Roan, reports from Zurich. He may have been celebrating surviving the biggest crisis in Fifa’s history, but as he faced a barrage of questions from the world’s media, Sepp Blatter discovered scrutiny of his leadership had not gone away. Fifa’s reputation is at an all-time low with two criminal investigations into allegations of systematic bribery and corruption totalling $150 million going back decades, and it has all happened on your watch. Why was it not time for you to go for the sake of football? It is very easy, seeing the results of the Congress yesterday. The Congress are of opinion that I am still the man to go into this problem and solve this problem. This week’s US-led arrests plunged Fifa into turmoil, but having swept to victory in yesterday’s presidential election, Blatter attacked his critics in America and Europe for conducting a hate campaign against him, dismissing ideas that he could be brought into the investigations. Are you concerned at some stage you might be arrested? Arrested for what? Next question. And what about an alleged $10 million bribe paid to ex-Fifa parabrokerjack Warner, authorised by a senior Fifa officials? Was it you? It definitely was not me. Is that incompetence or intentional negligence? The only thing I can say is that I have no $10 million. At Wembley, the focus returned to the sport itself. English football’s governing body was left to express its dismay at yesterday’s result. He will not be able to sort out a fundamentally corrupt organisation because he is part of it. If you are the captain of the ship and the ship is sinking, you should go. FA president Prince William helped lead England’s bid for the 2018 World Cup, only to lose out to Russia, a decision that is now being investigated by Swiss prosecutors. Today, the prince added his voice to calls for reform of world football’s governing body. These are challenging times for Fifa’s newly re-elected president who appeared tense and rattled this morning, but at the end of an unprecedented week, the 79-year-old remains in power. Serious challenges remain. Damaged relations with Fifa’s sponsors have to be repaired and there is still the possibility of a European boycott of the World Cup, and the authorities have warned of further charges in their bribery investigation. Sepp Blatter may still be here, but his grip on power has never felt so divisive or perhaps precarious. The Italian coastguard says more than 4,000 migrants have been rescued from the Mediterranean Sea in the past 24 hours, with the Royal Navy warship HMS Bulwark helping with the operation. The migrants, many of them women and children, were rescued from unseaworthy boats off the coast of Libya, and have been brought ashore in Italy. But the bodies of 17 people were found on one vessel. On a calm sea in perfect weather, a migrant boat settles slowly, dangerously, in the water. These people are lucky. A German navy vessel found them and took them aboard. Over 300 men, women and terrified children. The good weather means the numbers risking thisjourney have spiked dramatically. More than 4,000 were picked up from drifting fishing boats injust 24 hours, thronging the decks of warships from half a dozen European countries. Some do not make it. The Italian authorities say 17 died yesterday. In Italy, the cost of the rescue effort and of sheltering migrants has sparked political controversy and an intervention from the Pope. Leaving our brothers on the boats in the Sicilian channel was, he said, an attack on the sanctity of life. The Royal Navy’s flagship HMS Bulwark docked at the Italian port of Taranto this morning, as more than 700 dazed migrants filed ashore, the crew worked to restock with food and humanitarian supplies before setting sail once more. Meanwhile, they still come. At dawn this morning, a group come ashore on the Greek island of Kos, puncturing their flimsy inflatable before walking off in the hopes of a new life in Europe. At least 70 people are reported to have been killed in Syria’s Aleppo province by bombs dropped from government helicopters. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the worst incident was in the town of al-Bab, where a market was hit. The area is controlled by Islamic State. Macro speak the Syrian government has repeatedly denied using the bombs. A 16-year-old boy has appeared in court, accused of murdering a man and a woman in separate attacks in Colchester. Nahid Almanea was stabbed as she walked to the University of Essex lastjune, while james Attfield, who was 33, was found with more than a hundred knife wounds in an attack three months earlier. The boy, who cannot be named because of his age, entered no plea at the hearing at Chelmsford Magistrates’ Court. Hundreds of thousands of people who filed their tax returns late have been told they won’t have to pay fines, as long as they have a ""reasonable excuse"". HMRC says it wants to focus its resources ""on investigating major tax avoidance and evasion"". Here’sjoe Lynam. After working all week, why not treat yourself to a day out at the markets? Around 10 million of us failed a self-assessment tax return last year, but many did not file in time. Few at this market had any issues with the taxman not coming after them. issues with the taxman not coming afterthem. It after them. It is a great idea. It is a very sensible move. If they do not have the staff cuts of internal cuts, go after the not have the staff cuts of internal cuts, go afterthe biggerfish. Do it from the top-down, where the big fish are. I think they should go for big businesses, or companies that are purposefully avoiding it, rather than people who have just had a mistake. Staff levels at HMRC have been halved in the last decade, and they have been asked to maximise the money they get in. So they are now focusing on the big fish, the big tax avoidance and the big tax evaders, spending more time on them than on people who file late. But Margaret Hodge, the former Labour chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, said not pursuing those who filed late could ring the rules into disrepute, and some former tax inspectors agreed. The revenue has to encourage people to file their tax returns. If you said there is going to be a £100 fine, and then a few months later do let everybody off, that isn’t fair. The new Conservative government has promised to raise an additional £5 billion by clamping down further on aggressive tax avoidance. HMRC will have to do this with the same number, or even fewer, staff in the future. With all the sport, here’s Olly Foster at the BBC Sport Centre. It’s been a day of Cup finals, we will start at Wembley, where Arsenal have become the most successful club in the history of the FA Cup. They lifted the trophy for a record 12th time after beating Aston Villa 4-0, the biggest margin of victory in a final for 21 years. Our sports correspondent was at the match. For those who love football, it has been a week to forget. Arsenal reminded fans today why it is a sport to cherish. Tim Sherwood has steered Aston Villa from relegation threatened to the FA Cup final, but defence has not been their strong suit, and Arsenal quickly piled on the pressure. His last FA Cup final appearance 17 years ago, Shay given’s reaction was timely. But Villa fans began to fear their defence would crumble. Theo Walcott was up front, and had a point to prove. They say it’s the hope that kills you, but for Villa, it was a bullet. And if the sweetest of strikes broke their spirits, the easiest of headers broke their hearts. His side were well beaten before Olivier Giroud added the fourth cherry on the top, and ensured he equalled the record of the most successful manager in the history of the competition. I am very proud that our club is doing well. This win was not only historic, the first side ever to win 12 FA Cups, but also much deserved. Arsenal turned on the style to finish the season with a flourish, this brilliant performance the perfect antidote to a toxic week for football. Inverness Caledonian Thistle have their name on the Scottish Cup for the first time. They beat Falkirk 2-1 at Hampden Park. despite having a man sent off in the last 15 minutes. That allowed the Championship side back into the match, Peter Grant made it 1-1. But inside the last five minutes, substitute james Vincent scored the winner for Inverness. It’s been the club’s best season, they qualified for Europe after finishing third in the league and this is their first major trophy. Alastair Cook has become England’s leading run scorer in Tests. He passed Graham Gooch’s old record at Headingley on the second day of the second Test against New Zealand, that was after they had bowled the tourists out for 350. Patrick Gearey reports. just when England thought they had finished New Zealand’s innings, some gusts brought them up to 350 all out. This isn’t a series to dawdle. Pants on, runs to get. 32 would make Alistair Cooke’s England’s top ten run scorer. England cricketers don’t tend to make 8900 runs. The Yorkshireman came on to make his first test 50 in Leeds. The game had gone unusually flat. Time for building beer snakes and partnerships. The umpire said no. When England asked, the technology said otherwise. Born in Whitby, century in Headingley. He and they will remember that. The next hour was less memorable. Gary Ballance called a run that could not be completed. Gary Ballance would be joining him before long. And a third Yorkshireman was soon heading for a dressing room grumble. joe Root and Ben Stokes followed, so the test has taken a different route yes again. Saracens have become Aviva Premiersip Champions for the second time. They beat Bath 28 points to 16 in the play-off final at Twickenham Hookerjamie George scored one of their three tries to help them to a commmanding 25-3 lead at one stage and though Bath fought back in the second half. The trophy was Sarries’, 4 years after they last lifted it. They are the first side to finish outside the top two in the regular season and become champions. Finn Russell added another try after the break. He also kicked all four conversions. Glasgow have become the first Scottish side to win the title. Andy Murray is now into the la st last 16 of the French Open. jessica Ennis-Hill is competing in her first epitaph on since she won Olympic gold in London 2012. Her highlight today was a better than expected one metre 86 in the high jump. She is on course for the 6200 points required to qualify for the Rio Olympics next year. That is all the sport. You can see more on all of today’s stories on the BBC News Channel. From all of us here, have a very good night. Good evening. I hope you made the most of the first part of the weekend, because we have some rain on the way. It was a lovely day for many of us earlier on. This was Warwickshire. It was like that for many, but this evening has been changing all the while. This front has come in from the Atlantic, bringing rain with it. I thinkjust the far north and the north-east of the UK is the only part that will stick out and stay dry. Temperatures several degrees up on what we saw this morning, but it is a wet and windy start. That first pulse of rain moves out the way. Dull, damp and drizzly conditions will follow. The second batch of rain will come in from the west, so a pretty unsettled sort of day, but later on we will see something a bit dry and brighter towards the west. In that cool breeze, many of us will struggle with those temperatures. They will stay in the low teens, although a little warmer in the south-east. It is a windy day on Monday. Rain is gathering out towards the west, so it turns wet and windy on Tuesday night. Midweek onwards, things should turn drier, ",,
191,BBC1 London,21-may-2015,BBC News at One,13:00,40 mins,True,"Migration into the UK is up again, at 318,00 it’s a record high, with increases in people from EU and non-EU countries. The figures are released as the Prime Minister unveils plans to tackle illegal immigration. We’re going to make illegal working a criminal offence in its own right. That means wages paid to illegal migrants can be seized as proceeds of crime. We’ll be getting reaction to the latest figures from Norman Smith. The Mirror hacked and has to pay out more than a million pounds to eight celebrities it targetted. I didn’t trust anybody, the closest people to me in my life I couldn’t trust. Eight men appear in court charged in connection with the Hatton Garden jewellery heist. The Syrian city of Palmyra has fallen to Islamic State militants, increasing fears they could destroy the World Heritage site. against New Zealand at Lord’s. Later on BBC London: As Network Rail goes to court over next week’s strike, warnings the tube will also be affected. And with a warm afternoon in prospect, Elizabeth will have a full forecast. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC news at One. Migration into the UKjumped by 50% last year to 318,000. The Office for National Statistics said this was a ""statistically significant"" rise of more than 109,000. The news comes as David Cameron unveiled new plans to seize the wages of illegal workers as proceeds of crime in an attempt to reduce the numbers. He said it has become ""too easy"" for migrants not entitled to be in the country to exploit loopholes. Labour says the Conservatives are still not doing enough to protect the country’s borders. Our political correspondent Ross Hawkins reports. Immigration, can you come to the door, please? A raid on alleged illegal migrants in West London in front of the cameras. On the morning figures showed ministers missing their targets for legal migration by a mile. They promised to get net migration to under 100,000. Now it stands at 318,000. The difference between the numbers coming to the UK and leaving for over a yearjust shy of the record high reached under Labour. But at the Home Office, David Cameron said he still aimed to hit his migration target. There is the approach ofjust give up, cave in and forget about it. But that is not my approach. We had an open, successful trading economy in the 1990s. We had a far lower level of people coming to live in our country. He emphasised fresh government plans. A new review of illegal working, giving police the powers to seize migrants’ wages and it will be an offense to recruit abroad without advertising in the UK. An idea Labour say they had first. I would respect the Prime Minister for picking out our ideas, good on him, because they are the right thing to do for the United Kingdom. Ijust wish he voted for them, when we proposed them in the House of COITIITIOFIS B yâ8Iâ 890. The headlines this morning were about raids and police powers, much of the policy will be focused now on people who break no rules at all when they moved to Britain. Because the figures suggest the Home Office’s plans to control the number of people coming here legally aren’t working as well as they might hope. Both the numbers coming from inside and outside the European Union are sharply up. So, David Cameron says restricting EU migrants’ access to welfare will be an absolute requirement of his EU renegotiation and he wants to significantly reduce economic migration from outside Europe. Plenty of visible enforcement then, but it leaves securing that 100,000 net migration target a very long way off. Let’s speak to our assistant political editor Norman Smith who is at the Home Office. Not helpful figures for the Prime Minister, that probably understate it? Simon, Isuspect Minister, that probably understate it? Simon, I suspect some people will see today’s figures as Mission impossible for the Prime Minister in terms of this net migration down to his target of tens of thousands. He insists he will not cave in or give up, he is now demanding that all government departments focus on tackling immigration. He will take personal charge by chairing an immigration task force. He unveiled lots of new policies today. But there are already questions about how effective they will be, whether they can even be delivered. He is talking about tackling illegal working, but there will be no more resources to track down illegal workers. He is suggesting there will be further curbs on skilled workers coming here from outside the EU but thatis coming here from outside the EU but that is certain to enrage the business community. He is talking about trying to enforce a ban on EU migrants claiming in work benefits forfour migrants claiming in work benefits for four years, but that would require the agreement of our EU partners. But there is a bigger difficulty than all of those problems and that is the success of the British economy. It creates a huge pull factorfor the British economy. It creates a huge pull factor for migrants and the rest of the TEU, to come here and look for work. The real danger for Mr Cameron is this -- and look for work. The real danger for Mr Cameron is this -- for the EU. He looks like a man desperate trying to run down the escalator where no matter how hard he tries to run, he gets no closer to his hopeful destination. Thank you very much. The publisher of the Daily and Sunday Mirror has been ordered to pay one and a quarter million pounds in compensation to eight victims of phone-hacking. They include the actor Sadie Frost, who was awarded £260,000 and the former footballer Paul Gascoigne who received £188,000. Our correspondent David Sillito sent this report. Among those arriving in court today the actresses Sadie Frost and Lucy Taggart, just three of eight people who have been waiting for this day, for many years. In court it was announced that Paul Gascoigne who had suffered ten years of having his phone hacked would receive £188,000. The Coronation Street star received £117,000. And Sadie Frost £260,000 for what she felt was hounding by secret police. She had no idea where stories were coming from. When you lose trust in your friends, your family, you begin to... It is a very lonely place to be. It wasn’t the best time of my life, anyway. I couldn’t have the support I needed. When I found out I was hacked things began to make sense. I never realised the extent of it. The extent was the most kind of surprising thing about it. This is about far more than just a handful of famous names. For years, the Sunday Mirror has denied hacking. What has emerged here is the fact that the daily Mirror was hacking phones on a daily basis and it wasn’tjust intercepting phones on a daily basis and it wasn’t just intercepting voice wasn’tjust intercepting voice mail messages, it was accessing confidential details, medical records. This was going on for more than ten years. One convicted hacker explained how it happened. The words muppets muppetry. One mobile would be used to keep the phone busy at the second would access the voice mail. This might happen 60-100 times a day. The worry is that this company might face a huge bill because there are potentially hundreds of other claims to follow these eight will stop no one would want to see a newspaper have its viability threatened. This has shifted the legal landscape when it comes to privacy. Before today, the player was six to £5,000. The Mirror is considering an appeal but criminal action may follow. Eight or nine cases is being considered at the moment. Forthe eight nine cases is being considered at the moment. For the eight victims today a sense of relief that for them, it is over. A tenth man has been arrested in connection with the multi-million pound Hatton Garden safety deposit raid. The A2-year-old was detained in Essex this morning. It comes as eight men are due in court, charged in connection with the heist over the Easter weekend. They’re aged A8 to 76 and accused of conspiracy to burgle. Our correspondent Sarah Campbell is at Westminster Magistrates Court. It was a packed courtroom, illustrating the interest in this case, not least because the age of the defendants. Most had grey or white hair. Two of them had to have questions repeated, because they were hard of hearing. All have been charged with involvement in the theft of what the prosecution said was around £10 million worth of valuables. More than six weeks after millions of pounds ofjewellery and other valuables were stolen, the eight suspects were driven in convoy to Westminster Magistrates’ Court. They are charged with involvement in a raid at a safe deposit company in Hatton Garden, carried out over the Easter weekend. Hatton Garden, carried out over the Easterweekend. It is Hatton Garden, carried out over the Easter weekend. It is believed the scaled down a lift shaft and a hole was drilled in the volt wall and the contents of more than 70 deposit boxes stolen. Appearing in court today, the men who the police believe are responsible. One by one, they were asked their names. The youngest is aged A8, three pensioners. All are charged with conspiracy to burgle. At 76, the oldest suspect is Harry Reader. Also charged, his 50 runs on, Paul, both from Dartford in Kent. Hugh Doyle a 4081, from north London and 67-year-old Terry Perkins are also charged. They were arrested during coordinated raids across London in Kent on Tuesday. 200 flying squad officers took part, searching a total of 12 properties. Afterwards, the police said they believed items seized during the raid had been taken from the Hatton Garden Sadie deposits. Owners of the stolen goods now have an anxious wait to see whether that is indeed the case. The eight men who allegedly carried out the heist were remanded in custody until a Crown Court appearance on the 4th ofjune. A ninth suspect who was arrested earlier this week is currently on police bail. The 10th suspect who was arrested this morning in Essex is currently being questioned at a London police station. Thank you. Five students at Lancaster University are in hospital, two of them in a serious condition, after taking a banned synthetic cannabis drug known as Spice. The drug was a legal high and sold in shops, until it was outlawed six years ago. The university has warned students of the dangers and has asked them to check on friends who may have taken the drug. The Syrian city of Palmyra, one of the greatest archaeological sites of the Middle East, is now under the control of Islamic State. Syrian television says that government troops have withdrawn and that most of the city’s residents have fled. Some precious artefacts have been taken to safety, but many others remain. Our Middle East correspondentjim Muir sent this report from Beirut. The IS attack on Palmyra came out of the blue after the militants attacked across the desert from the East. Government forces, army troops and local militia resisted for about a week, but then collapsed suddenly as the militants pushed into town from the north, getting ever closer to the precious archaeological ruins. The ancient site at Palmyra with its Greco-Roman temples and colonnaded streets had been preserved for 2,000 years. It’s one of the world’s best-known cultural treasures and in normal times visited by tens of thousands of tourists every year. The Syrian authorities are well aware of Palmyra’s unique value, they took steps to rescue what could be saved. TRANSLATION: We have saved hundreds of statues that were under fire by snipers. Two of our workers were injured, during the operation. The statues are now safe, but the question is how to protect the beautiful temples and monuments that are in this city. The international community is also aghast at the prospect of the priceless ruins being destroyed. It is an extremely important World Heritage Site, which belongs to all of humanity. We have the responsibility to protect and preserve it. I can’t imagine that the world will never see Palmyra evermore. Those fears are clearly not misplaced, the militants deliberately demolished similarly irreplaceable sites at Nimrud and Hatra in northern Iraq, saying they represent idolatry. just a few days earlier, the inhabitants of Ramidi were fleeing their lives. The people of Palmyra have lost their homes. All this despite everything the Western coalition and the Iraqi and Syrian governments could do to stop them. of Top Gear, jeremy Clarkson has spoken of his regret at no longer being involved in the show. He told Chris Evans on BBC Radio 2 that it was his ""own silly fault"". Clarkson’s contract was not renewed after he punched a producer in the face during filming. Our correspondent Colin Paterson reports. jeremy Clarkson back at the BBC, for his first interview since he was told two months ago his Top Gear career was over. Welcome to the Radio 2 breakfast showjeremy Clarkson. Good morning, Chris, how are you? He told Chris Evans he was still coming to terms with losing his job for an unprovoked physical and verbal attack on one of Top Gear’s producers. It was my own silly fault, so I can hardly complain. Which were you saddest about, if it is at all comparable? Having to leave Top Gear or having to stop working for the BBC? Equal. Because I like the BBC. There are some dreadful people in it, but there are also some really talented, brilliant people. Bring it back. Ready, look at this! Tomorrow, jeremy Clarkson will be reunited with Richard Hammond and james May, the trio who presented Top Gear together for 12 years. They will start a long-planned live tour in Belfast, originally billed as Top Gear Live, but they can no longer use any of the show’s branding. But he said it could be months before any future TV projects are announced. He denied having talks with broadcasters or the streaming service, Netflix. I have just been listening, talking would involve me saying something. It was very sudden. You would be a fool to justjump into something, you need to have a look what’s out there. Before he roared off in the Ferrari, jeremy Clarkson said he wasn’t ruling out a return to the BBC. Although his contract wasn’t renewed, he was never actually sacked. Our top story this lunchtime. Net migration into the UK is up again. And still to come: Destination Dunkirk - the little ships heading for the French coast, 75 years after the mission Winston Churchill described as ""a miracle of deliverance"". ' â9o .ÂÂ""Iâ ,go upin , go up in sport, the latest of from the latest from the England football team as Roy Hodgson names his squad. It’s the first day of the first Test of England versus New Zealand at Lord’s. And the team are going into it in an excellent position - having had a great World Cup and rising up the rankings they’re considered one of the best Test sides in the world. Unfortunately, that’s New Zealand. England, batting first today, have already collapsed. At lunch they were 99-4. ~ -- 115-4. Our sports correspondent joe Wilson is at Lord’s. It is horribly familiar. No hesitation from the New Zealanders, they decided to bowl. They are here to make the most of every opportunity, they only have two Test matches. They want to utilise the weather conditions to make the most of their bowlers but also to exploit those ongoing uncertainties in the England setup. One morning on, four English batsmen wondering where it all went wrong. But I suppose it’s tradition. Here WE QO again. It’s sport’s most sedate race, the MCC members queueing at Lord’s for their place in the pavilion. New Zealand this year, chaps. And new faces. The new boss, Andrew Strauss, welcoming the latest opening batsman, Adam Lyth, England’s 666 player - just a number. And a new fast bowler, Mark Wood, another international from the Durham production line. Same captain though. Alastair Cook. Oh, the sheer simplicity of scoring runs, that is after all Cook’s job, although at least the part of it he enjoys. Adam Lyth’s debut at the crease lasted 17 balls. The faintest of touches still enough to end an innings. Gone for seven. Well, that’s Test cricket. Gary Ballance is England’s Mr Reliable. In at number three, out for one. New Zealand, quite at home. Cook thought he could hit this one, well, he did, to the wicketkeeper. England 25-3. Worse, Ian Bell into bat, the ball from Matt Henry was too good. In truth, England could not have imagined a worse opening hour of the season. As the caretaker coach on the balcony, the new director in the stands, well, someone has to stick around in the middle. Attack is the best form of defence, that’s the motto Ben Stokes bats by. And so one day one the rebuilding began. England will resume in about 20 minutes’ time on 113-4, Stokes-macro on 36, joe Root not out, newly promoted to England’s vice captain. A lot is expected of Root today and in the future. I suppose we can reflect this is the beauty of Test match cricket, although it was very much New Zealand’s morning, it may yet the England’s day. Is that right? The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall have arrived in Belfast on the first of a two-day visit to Northern Ireland. They are visiting a Catholic Church in north Belfast, as part of its 200th anniversary celebrations. St Patrick’s on Donegall Street has been at the centre of disputes in relation to loyalist band parades. The BBC’s discovered that a terror suspect from Manchester who is banned from returning to Britain is living freely in Denmark. 22-year-old Ahmed Halane grew up in Bolton and Chorlton and is suspected of fighting with militant groups abroad. Duncan Crawford reports. They’re Britain’s most notorious jihadi brides, Zahra and Salma Halane, from Manchester, who ran away to Syria and married Islamic State fighters. The twin sisters used to spread the group’s propaganda. I came to England when I was nine years old. But this is their elder brother, Ahmed. He is also accused of extremism, suspected ofjoining up with jihadists in Somalia and Syria. He’s subject to an exclusion order, banned from returning to Britain, but the BBC can reveal he is back in Europe, living freely in Denmark. This is him, on the outskirts of the Danish city of Aarhus. The BBC secretly filmed Ahmed Halane after he declined to speak to us. He has been attending this mosque, which has been accused of radicalising young men to fight in Syria. Ahmed Halane has been attending this mosque. It’s just the last maybe 20 days, not before. The mosque is now working with police to rehabilitate returnee fighters. We give a very clear message to our people here in the mosque that we are a part of this country and we don’t accept by anyway to destroy this society we live in. In Denmark, returnee fighters can face arrest or imprisonment but the focus has been on integrating them back into Danish life. Ahmed Halane is a Danish citizen. That’s why the British authorities can ban him from re-entering the UK. But should someone deemed so dangerous in Britain be free to roam the streets of Europe? The tracking of terror suspects is a growing challenge for security services. The BBC understands that Ahmed Halane is being monitored. He may have returned to Europe but his sisters are seemingly committed to Islamic State. The Halane family torn apart by radicalisation. One of the country’s most senior doctors has said that ministers must end their ""surreal obsession"" with wanting GPs surgeries in England to open seven days a week. The chairman of the British Medical Association’s GP committee, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, has told a conference that there are not enough doctors to cope. Our health editor Hugh Pym is with me now. What else has been saying? The BMA’s job is to What else has been saying? The BMA’sjob is to represent BMA’s job is to represent the interests of its members, that is doctors, and they’ve been saying they are under pressure, the workload is going up because of increasing patient demand and there aren’t enough GPs to fill vacancies. We have heard that before. The interesting thing today is their attack on the government’s plan over the next four or five years to extend the NHS in England to seven-day working, with surgeries opening at weekends. The GPs really don’t like that. There was prolonged applause when the GPs’ don’t like that. There was prolonged applause when the GPs’ leader at the BMA made his speech at their conference this morning. And if government claims to have any clue about the plight of general practice, it must halt its surreal obsession for practices to open seven days, when there aren’t the GPs to even cope with current demands. APPLAUSE. This is after David Cameron said this is what he wants. The Prime Minister said he wants a 7 NHS in England, the first of its kind anywhere in the world. He wants 5000 more GPs, seven-day working, surgeries open at weekends and so on, and here are GPs saying that is not possible, it is not the important thing here, we need to concentrate, they think, on the immediate crisis. The Department of Health have hit back and said the BMA’s view with negative and pessimistic and there are thousands of GPs offering seven-day access, by next March one third of the country will be covered. This debate will continue. Train companies have started cancelling services over the Bank Holiday because of a planned strike by thousands of Network Rail workers in a row over pay. the TSSA union has suspended its strike after a new pay offer from Network Rail. The RMT is still threatening action. Talks are continuing to try to solve the dispute. Severe damp, rat infestations, risk of explosions - the grim reality of some private rentals. A report by Citizens Advice has found landlords of thousands of privately rented homes in England are putting the health of tenants at risk by failing to keep standards up to a legal minimum. The charity says around a sixth of all privately rented properties are in a far worse condition than social housing. Our social affairs correspondent Michael Buchanan reports. The private rented sector in England has doubled over the past decade to nearly 4.5 million households. But not everyone is staying in a decent home. Someone actually lives in this London flat. The bedroom is infested with fleas and bedbugs. It’s damp. There are rodents. There is nowhere to wash. Look at the flooring in this room. It is covered in cement. There are mice coming through the floor. The landlord wasn’t interested in helping. She has put down the cement herself. Through there is the bathroom, which hasn’t worked in several years. For this, she is paying £600 a month. Today’s report from citizens advice says nearly three quarters of a million households in England are living in private rented homes that are unsafe. The charity says tenants are paying over £5.5 billion in rent to live in illegal conditions. Stacey and her four children have spent the past week living in this single room. She was recently evicted by her landlord after she says she repeatedly complained to him about the property’s condition. There was damp growing from the floor to the ceiling. The mould was thick around the windows. We did not have the boiler, we had three winters with no heating or hot water. That is going to be really stressful on all of us. It was just a really depressing horrible time. As houses become increasingly expensive to buy, more people will be forced to rent. And despite today’s report, landlords say most tenants get a good deal. There are poor conditions in a small minority of properties. But something like 80% of tenants say they are satisfied or very satisfied with their landlord. Most landlords keep their properties in good condition and rent good-quality homes. Ministers say they are giving councils a range of powers to tackle rogue landlords. Many tenants wish they would use them more often. Around 50 small boats set out this morning from Ramsgate in Kent bound for the beaches of northern France to mark the anniversary of the Dunkirk evacuation. On board a handful of veterans who made that same journey 75 years before - in very different circumstances - to take part in what Winston Churchill called ""a miracle of deliverance"". The so-called ""little ships"" helped rescue more than 338,000 British and French soldiers trapped on the beaches during the Second World War. Our correspondent Andy Moore reports. A Hurricane and a Spitfire flew by in tribute to the little ships as they headed out to sea. There were all sorts of different vessels, from Thames barges to pleasure cruisers. Many of these little ships were designed to sail on inland waters, so setting out across the Channel on the open seas will be quite a challenge. But they will be well looked after. This time they were escorted by a lifeboat. 75 years ago they were attacked by German warplanes. NEWSREEL: Hour after hour, men weighed out of waiting ships. The British and French forces were trapped on the beaches of Dunkirk surrounded by the Germans. Hundreds of small boats were requisitioned at short notice. Theirjob was to ferry soldiers to larger ships or bring them directly to English ports. 95-year-old Garth Wright remembers the relief of being told he was going home. The skipper and captain said, you can stay on board. What a lovely feeling and I didn’t argue with him at all. Vic Viner was 23 at the time. He manned a small boat rowing soldiers off the beaches in rough seas. There was blood all over my hands, and of my colleagues. We had sweated blood for the effort. I went back aboard and said to the captain, you know, we can’t do this any more. He said, you’re not going to because Operation Dynamo is taken place. In the end more than a third of a million men were rescued from the beaches. They formed the nucleus of an army that would live to fight another day. The slowjourney to France will take six or seven hours. But the seas are calm, just as they were 75 years ago, when Operation Dynamo ended in what Winston Churchill called ""a miracle of deliverance"". You’re watching the BBC News at One.

That’s according to the Payments Council, which says that last year only 48% of transactions were in cash. Here’s our personal finance correspondent, Simon Gompertz. It’s the big switchover from cash to cards and electronic payments. Increasingly, contactless cards you just wave over the terminal. Some shoppers don’t bother to go out with much cash at all. What do you think about cash? It’s becoming a bit obsolete. It’s nice to hold, nice if you’ve got it. You’ve got no notes at all? None. We’re definitely going to go cashless. It is much simpler. It makes it easier to transact. You are most likely to use a card in supermarkets, electrical shops and petrol stations. Cash still rules in newsagents, pubs and convenience stores. It’s favoured for controlling spending and for safety. Is cash king? Cash is king. My identity has been stolen three times from credit cards. You are safer with cash? Safer with cash. You can carry cash and cards, but 1.6 million rely on cash most of the time. Many aged over 65. While 2.3 million rarely use cash, mostly under 35. Businesses don’t buy what they need with cash. Their customers still are the ones more likely to use it. It’s not quite the end of cash, but within ten years, cash will account forjust one in three of the purchases that we make.

And it was not suicide, it contradict -- in squalid conditions. And it was not suicide, it contradict -- a coroner contradicts German police Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. The government’s aim of drastically reducing immigration suffered another setback today after new figures showed a surge in the numbers coming to Britain. Net migration, that’s the number of people arriving in the UK minus the number leaving has risen to 318,000. That’s the highest level for a decade. The government says it remains committed to reducing the number to ""tens of thousands"" and it’s unveiled new measures aimed at tackling illegal immigration. Our Deputy Political Editor james Landale has more details. This is what the battle against illegal immigration looks like on the front line. A police raid on a house in west London, where illegal immigrants are thought to be living. A raid for the cameras and Prime Minister, whose big a problem today was not migrants who come here illegally but those who come fully within the law. The latest figures show that while 323,000 people left the UK last year, an extraordinary 641,000 came in. A massive increase from the year before. Of those, 290,000 came from outside the EU, 268,000 from within Europe. Figures that leave David Cameron’s target of the juicy net migration to the tens of thousands in tatters. It is disappointing that we have not met targets but it is a clear instruction to deliver and deliver faster. The premise to gathered hundreds of civil servants at the parliamentary cuts net migration and set out new plan to stem the flow. This isn’tjust about having better border controls, it is about making sure that if people are here illegally, it isn’t as easy to the health service, get a council house, have a job, have a driving licence. You have got to deal with each and every one of those things. He promised a new immigration bill in next week’s Queen ‘s speech including new powers to seize the wages of illegal workers and deport them more quickly. A ban on firms recruiting overseas without advertising in the UK and a plan to reduce significantly the number of skilled workers from outside the EE you. And... Changes to welfare to cut EU migration will be an absolute requirement in my renegotiation. Isn’t the truth is that while the economy is growing, net migration will rise and no amount of clamp-downs, deterrence, benefit curbs clamp-downs, deterrence, benefit curbs will change that? -- deterrents. There is the approach of give up, cave in and forget about it. That is not my approach. In recent years, Wrexham has seen some of the largest increases in Eastern European migration in Wales. The youngsters just European migration in Wales. The youngstersjust can’t getjobs. I’ve no objection to them coming, like, but they need to be kept, don’t they? As long as they are coming here to work. But a lot of them aren’t here to work. Maybe if you limited it a bit and forced our own to work, they would not claim benefits. Ukip said the free movement of labour within Europe had to be stopped. Labour said they were copying their plans to protect low- paid copying their plans to protect low-paid migrants. I respect the Prime Minister for picking our ideas, good on him because they are the right thing for the United Kingdom. Ijust wished he voted for them when we propose them in the House of Commons a year ago. His hopes of reducing migration rests in part on persuading EU ministers to cut benefits to their nationals in this country which will be no easy task. It is one the Prime Minister will begin at an EU summit tomorrow. Our Home Editor Mark Easton is with me here. There’s no sign of immigration slowing down, what effect is that having on the country as a whole? 318,000 extra people coming to live in Britain, equivalent to a city the size of Preston. But the effect is not even, most immigrants head for London, where one person in three is foreign-born. In the north-east it is nearer one in 18. In Scotland, they have seen some falls in the number of immigrants in the population. The Scottish Government is arguing they want more immigration to boost their economy. Similar voices in parts of Wales. Where you do have sudden, un-planned increases in immigration, it has an impact on public services. Housing, schools, maternity services. Somebody groups are saying the government’s inability to control net migration means they should put more emphasis on ensuring services aren’t stretched. The other big impact is cultural. In London, whole neighbourhoods have been reinvented as new communities come in. The numbers may be small in other parts of England, but where you have smaller communities, less used immigration, the psychological impact of that change can be just as great. Many thanks. Eight men charged in connection with the Hatton Garden jewellery raid have appeared in court today. They’re aged between 48 and 76 and accused of conspiracy to burgle. Detectives say valuables worth more than £10 million were stolen. Sarah Campbell reports. The journey to court was as high-profile as this case has become. A convoy of police man is transported the eight suspects to London’s. Photographers were keen to get a glimpse of the alleged burglars. Some of them were caught on camera inside the bands. But it was inside the courtroom, as the men took their seats in the dock that the reason this case has remained in the headlines became clear. Reflecting the advancing years, most had greying or white hair, two seemed to have hearing issues, finding it difficult to hear the questions. The oldest was 76 involved Brian Reader from Dartford in Kent in the brown top, next to him, 74john Collins. Three of the group pensionable age. All are charged with conspiring to carry out a raid at this safety deposit company in London’s jewellery district Hatton Garden. It is believed the premises was entered via a lift shaft, a hole was drilled through the 50 centimetre deep volt wall and over the course of the bank of the banker the weekend, the contents of more than 70 deposit boxes were stolen. On Tuesday, the flying squad carried out a series of coordinated raids across London and Kent, arrests were made and the police said they believed that items seized had been taken from the Hatton Garden safety deposit. In total, the police have arrested ten men in connection with the raid. The eight who appeared here earlier today, were remanded in custody and are scheduled to appear at Southwark Crown Court on june fourth. The former England footballer Paul Gascoigne and the actress Sadie Frost are among a number of celebrities who received six-figure settlements at the High Court today, after their phones were hacked byjournalists at Mirror Group Newspapers. The total figure for damages was in excess of a million pounds. Our Correspondent David Sillito was in court. Sadie Frost arrived in court today forjudgement on five years of torment. Her medical records, her children’s lives, her mental health, visits to Alcoholics Anonymous all appeared in the Mirror. She thought it was her friends who are betraying her. When you lose trust in your friends, yourfamily, you know, you begin to... You know, it’s a very lonely place to be. These are record pay-outs. Paul Gascoigne was hacked for nine years, he is receiving more than £188,000. Coronation Street’s Shobna Gulati over £117,000. Sadie Frost, more than £260,000. And EastEnders’s Lucy Benjamin £157,000. Seven years the hacking took place. I am glad it’s all over. For years, Mirror Group denied there was any evidence of hacking. But what’s emerged here is the fact that the Mirror was hacking phones on a daily basis. It wasn’t just intercepting voice mail messages. It was accessing confidential details, medical records. This was going on for more than ten years. E-mails were written in code. The Muppets were the hackers. One journalist was making 60-100 calls per day. What is uncertain is how many claims will now come. Scores, certainly. Possibly hundreds. This is a legal landmark. The question is, how far has the culture changed? Hopefully hacking is history. What will replace it? The competition is still there. journalists are still under severe pressure to go out and get that scoop. The question is, can they and will they do that within the law? As the victims left, Mirror Group was pondering an appeal. It was thought £12 million would cover the costs. That figure went up today by an extra £16 million. And criminal charges are also being considered. A 23-year-old woman, who has spent five years in prison for the murder of her friend’s boyfriend in Somerset, has been acquitted at a retrial. She has also been released. Stacey Hyde’s conviction for killing Vincent Francis at his flat in Wells, was overturned by the Court of Appeal last year. Her family and the group, justice for Women had been campaigning on her behalf. A taxi driver from north west London has been found guilty the murder of a US soldier in Iraq, in a roadside bombing, eight years ago. Woolwich Crown Court heard how Anis Sardar, who’s 38 and from Wembley, built bombs as part of a campaign to kill Americans fighting in the country. One caused the death of 34-year-old Sergeant First Class Randyjohnson, who died after a bomb hit the armoured vehicle he was travelling in. Daniel Sandford is outside Woolwich Crown Court. An unusual case? Yes, Anis Sadar went to Syria in 1997 to learn Arabic but ten years later he was in a rock, making bombs, targeting American soldiers who was taking part in the surge, trying to prop up the new government in Baghdad. He claimed in court that the bombs were aimed at Shia militias, attacking the silly Muslims that the jury decided he was specifically targeting US soldiers in heavy armoured vehicles. When one of the bombs killed Sergeant first class Randyjohnson in 2007, Anis Sardar returned to Wembley and became a black cab driver. He even started working with young offenders in the Young offenders institution in Feltham in West London. But the Americans kept every bomb that they found in Iraq and Afghanistan in a huge warehouse in Virginia. They spend years poring over them, for fingerprints and eventually Anis Sardar’s prints were found on two devices links to the bomb which killed Sergeant Randyjohnson.

Tomorrow, a referendum will decide Ireland’s approach with all of the Republic’s main political parties calling for a ""yes"". But the Catholic Church is opposed to any change and as our Ireland Correspondent Chris Buckler reports, Ireland’s church and state are battling for every last vote. In Ireland, the referendum about marriage has sparked a debate about equality and what makes a modern family. From shopping centres to the streets, Yes campaigners are trying to persuade people to vote in favour of allowing two men or two women to marry. When you fall in love with someone, there are natural steps and my natural next step with my beautiful partner would be to ask her to marry me. Among the supporters of the Yes campaign, celebrities, sports stars and politicians from all of Ireland’s main parties. But among the most vocal opponents to any change in the definition of marriage, the Catholic Church. In Ireland, that still matters. It is away from the cities, in rural towns and villages, where that concern about change is strongest. Here in County Donegal, most people leaving morning Mass indicated that they would be voting No. I totally believe in equality for gay people and I do not have a problem with that but I also believe in equality for children, and I think it is their right to have a mother and a father. Issues surrounding religion and children have waded into this referendum. In Ireland, the family is protected as a moral institution in law. The introduction of same-sex marriage would require a change to the constitution, which is why there has to be a public vote. This phrase, same-sex marriage, there is no such thing. Same-sex relations, certainly, marriage, certainly. Together, it is like water and oil, they don’t mix. Modern Ireland remains a Catholic country but on this issue, people hold different beliefs. Tom is the general secretary of Ireland’s main government party and a devout Catholic. One of his three sons is gay. I want our people to say, this guy is the equal to my two sons and my daughter, or anybody else. He is trying to realay a message to other Catholics like him to vote yes and I think it is absolutely amazing what he’s doing and I’m so proud of him for doing it. It means so much to me. And it’s important to you as a father? This is fundamental to me as a father. Fundamental. There is nothing, you know, if you say you love somebody, you have to do it. And this is doing it. It is only 22 years since homosexuality was officially decriminalised in Ireland. In cities like Dublin, there is a clear confidence among the gay and lesbian community. However, this referendum will be decided by voters from right across this country. A 24 hour train strike planned for Bank Holiday Monday has been called off. Talks between the unions and Network Rail had been going on for four days over a pay deal. The action was suspended after a new offer was put forward. Our Industry Correspondent john Moylan is at Waterloo station in London. Relief for rail users, but is the dispute now resolved? Formally, the dispute is not over but it does mean that the first national rail strike in more than 20 years, which would have hit nine out of ten services on Monday and Tuesday, that is now off the table. It happened after Network Rail tabled a revised offer, allowing the unions to say that they would suspend their action and look at that offer with their members. The government today has welcomed this decision and the train companies which were warning of mass cancellations yesterday have today been saying that they expect to run a near normal bank holiday service. just a word of warning, that does involve lots of engineering works, a whopping £27 million worth of engineering over the next few days involving 14,000 people working on the network. If you are travelling over the next few days, despite the fact that the strike is over, the advices to check with the train company about possible disruption. There’s growing concern tonight about the fate of one of world’s most important archaeological sites. Fighters from so-called Islamic State have entered the ancient city of Palmyra in Syria, according to reports. The extremists have already destroyed sites in Iraq that were built before Islam and the fear is they’ll do the same to Palmyra. These pictures were taken as IS fighters moved towards the city and Syrian government forces withdrew. So far it’s believed the site, on the road between the capital Damascus and the eastern city of Deir al-Zour, is still intact. We asked one of the country’s top experts, the historian Dan Cruickshank, to explain Palmyra’s significance. It is one of the great ruined classical cities of the ancient world. You travel east from Damascus and suddenly you see a magical world, great columns rising up. And you know you are in the presence of something utterly wonderful. The street stretches from the west to the east. Originally, there would have been shocked and palaces and houses on either side. In the middle, this amazing arch, a wonderful piece of architecture. It is intrinsically beautiful, stone in the desert landscape. The space, the sun, the sense of antiquity. And with it, a tremendous attached story, as a great Arab trading city before Islam, one of the jewels of the latter Roman Empire. That it should fall to Islamic State is appalling given that we have seen what they did to many other great classical Arab artefacts. These attacks are cultural terrorism, destroying memories, architecture and our political sites. In addition, they are destroying images. This is why these attacks are unprecedented. There are these great locations on earth were they passed somehow lives and you can come with your imagination, go back. They are full of information. If we lose Palmyra, we are robbing generations of a place of wonder and inspiration. The art historian Dan Cruickshank on the Syrian site of Palmyra and why it is considered one of the most important cultural centres of the ancient world. jeremy Clarkson has admitted that being dismissed from Top Gear was entirely his own fault and that leaving the programme has left ‘a big hole’ in his life.

Before he roared off in a Ferrari, jeremy Clarkson said he was not ruling out a return to the BBC. Although his contract was not renewed, he was never actually sacked. morning to Dunkirk in France in honour of one of the most famous rescue missions of the Second World War. The flotilla took six and a half hours to reach the French coast, making the same journey as that made 75 years ago when 300,000 Allied soldiers were evacuated from Dunkirk. England’s summer season didn’t get off to a good start today. They lost four quick wickets against New Zealand before joe Root and Ben Stokes put together a fight back.

England could not have imagined a worse opening hour. But perspectives can quickly change, just ask this cameraman. joe Root and Ben Stokes proceeded in perfect humour. A partnership of 161 as Ben Stokes in particular took the aggressive approach to rebuilding England’s innings. Which made his dismissal look especially in exportable. Eight short of a century, just to rub it in. The interval allowed cloud dispersal and discussion. England were five wickets down but past 200, so could you feel the fragile confidence of a cricket nation being restored? Maybe. Nothing more reassuring thanjoe Root in full flow, moving with complete composure to a century. Still, 98, he was gone. But after that, to a century. Still, 98, he was gone. But afterthat, England gone. But after that, England were still batting after 300. And that is progress. A lovely day in Lourdes, but how has it been elsewhere? Blue skies across many parts of the country. This photo was sent in by Marco. The skies were blue above him with plenty of sunshine. We will keep this blue sky. Increasing cloud bringing outbreaks of rain to parts of Northern Ireland, West of Scotland and later in the night, sinking across northern England and Wales. Towards the south-east, clearer skies lasting through the night but wherever you are, it will be frost free to start Friday. Friday, we will have the best of the brightness in the far south-east. Later in the day, it will start to cloud up. Towards the North West, things brightening up later in the day. The return of sunshine to Northern Ireland and Scotland and temperatures up to 19 degrees. During Saturday, high pressure in charge. Light winds, a lot of sunshine, and it is looking like a dry day for many of us. Towards the north-west, Sunday brings light rain pushing its way across the country. Then we are back to sunny skies and fresher conditions. All in all, not a bad bank holiday weekend. That is all from the BBC News at six. On BBC One, we can nowjoin BBC news teams where you are. Tonight on BBC London News. The shocking state of many of the capital’s rented homes.

They claim that rogue landlords earn billions of pounds per year for unsafe homes that fail to meet legal standards. Hugh Strickland is chief economist of a consumer charity. We looked at the private rented stop in England and found that three quarters of a million households are unsafe and dangerous and should not be let out.

He accepted evidence from an expert in cults who said that the organisation seduced young people by pretending that it was lifting when Ed had right-wing tendencies and was anti-Semitic. And whenjeremiah anti-Semitic. And when jeremiah Duggan anti-Semitic. And whenjeremiah Duggan expressed that he wasjewish and challenged their views, he may have been threatened by members of that organisation and that is what caused him to leave. The inquest heard that he was likely to be under severe psychological pressure at that conference. The coroner said there were unexplained injuries on his body, so he might have been involved in an altercation before he died. He did reject evidence given yesterday that said that he was killed elsewhere and then his body was moved and the scene had been staged. This afternoon, his mother spoke outside the court. She said that she hoped that this narrative verdict acted as a warning to other young people thinking ofjoining right-wing organisations. How long has all of this gone on for? This goes back to 2003. The family has never access did that it was suicide, and neither did the first British inquest back then. In 2003, a German High Court ruled that the original police investigation was flawed. So that is ongoing. The family hope that the verdict today is taken into account. They stayed -- they say that they do not believe that they still have all wheels is. -- all the answers. In the first operation of its kind in the country surgeons in Essex have successfully carried out two operations at the same time on a patient with two different heart conditions. Cherie Bason had the surgery at Basildon hospital. It’s thought hundreds of people could benefit from the same procedure. As you might expect, Debbie Tubby’s report does contain images of surgery. This is Cherie Bason’s first checkup with both of her heart specialists since her five hour dual operation only a month ago. How long before you were up and walking around and feeling reasonably OK? I suppose after a few days. This is her ground-breaking operation filmed by the hospital. Traditionally she would have needed open-heart surgery with her breastbone cup in two and a vein taken from her leg. But these operations by two surgeons at the same time are less traumatic and invasive. The combined the two and physically do both of them at the same time under the same anaesthetic with the same port of access, that is unique at the moment. It is great as a practitioner to be involved at the cutting-edge and offering patience the best that you can offer them. An opening is made in Cherie Bason’s lake. A spent is pushed into the blocked artery. Immediately afterwards another surgeon uses a -- uses the same access point to repair a valve in her heart. We have seen an example of where we can enhance the clinical benefit to patience and get them back to work of physical activity sooner and in an austere environment like we have at the moment and health care, it is a winning strategy. Cherie Bason returned home after spending only four days in hospital. Traditionally, she would have needed three months to recover. Never in my wildest dreams had I thought that four weeks down the line I would be feeling as I do now. Ijust count myself extremely fortunate to have been able to use the facilities at Basildon. This operation not only means one step in hospital and less time in theatre, but reduced risks, and faster recovery times, and the possibility of other combined heart problems being operated on at the same time. The Bank Holiday rail strike may be off- but a tube strike could be on the cards. The union, Aslef, has announced that drivers on London Underground are to be balloted for strikes. It’s in a row over pay for new all-night services. Alice Bhandhukravi joins us with the details. is new strike action plan for the Tube network. It is not related to the national rail strike that was planned on bank holiday Monday and Tuesday. That was called off today when unions managed to come to agreement with Network Rail. This strike action is about plans for the 2l+-hour tube. That is the overnight services starting on September I2 on some lines. On thejubilee line and Victoria line, most of the Piccadilly, Centraland Victoria line, most of the Piccadilly, Central and Northern line, on Fridays and Saturdays. What are the drivers unhappy about? Basically, their terms and conditions have not been finalised, so a row has developed over how it will work in practice. 80% of Tube drivers are reported to be members of the union, Aslef. And Aslef says that they have been told that, unless drivers agreed to rosters which include all-night services on Friday and Saturday night, they will be imposed and no pay offer will be made this year. They say that they are not opposed to all-night services but they would like them to be introduced in a fair and sensible way. They say that London Underground has closed down negotiations and they need to think about the work life balance of their members. What does London Underground have to say? Nick Brown, the chief operating officer, says they have been in discussion with trade union since the jury, and they say, to suggest that we have closed down negotiations is completely untrue. They say that they are extremely disappointed to hear of this strike ballot. What happens next? The ballot decision will be made by Aslef on 18th june. We will expect to hear about that decision. The RMT union will be balloting its members on strike action on this issue, so we shall see. The father of a teenager who was murdered in a park in Chelmsford says his son was lured to his death. Stephen Davenport pleaded guilty to murdering Ashley Woolley yesterday. just as his trial was about to start. Ashley’s father Trevor has been talking to Richard Daniel. He began by describing the moment, a week before Christmas last year, when he heard his son had been murdered. It is still like it is not real, now. I was meant to meet him on the Friday for a drink, before I went to work, and I am still waiting to meet him, and that will never happen. We get on with our lives and we move on, but it is a relief, and now we can see the story of what happened, because up until that point, we could not. Stephen Davenport was a coUege could not. Stephen Davenport was a college colleague, a friend. Ashley had befriended him because he felt he was the loan of the class. Ashley was one of the kids that said, come and join the party. -- was one of the kids that said, come and join the party. -- the loner. What do you know about the events leading up to the killing? We know that the killer had fantasies of murdering someone, and when Ashley was the one in the class who befriended cup him, he chose him. He saw Ashley coming out and he ran up behind him and he stabbed him. He knew nothing about what was going to happen. He stabbed him in the neck, and then on the floor, he stabbed him in the kidney and liver. You spoke about the moment that Davenport admitted his guilt. What are your feelings towards him? At the moment I have got no feelings. I am still trying to come to terms with the loss of Ashley. He loved life. He was cheeky, he was funny. If he saw somebody was down, he would crack a joke and make them laugh. That is what he wanted, fun in life. He wants to move on. Whenever we feel sad about Ashley, we think about the good times that we had with him. Then looking on the other side we are never going to see any otherfun times. other side we are never going to see any other fun times. The plans that we had for this year are never going to happen. Trevor Woolley ending that report from Richard Daniel. Next: how do you get a million Londoners tojoin a car club? Turns out it’s not an easy task because it means people giving up their vehicles for the greater good of city. But that’s what transport bosses want more of us to do. Let’s join Alpa Patel in central London who can tell us more. ~ Iam standing I am standing next to a car club car. You can tell by the badge in the windscreen window and the fact thatitis the windscreen window and the fact that it is in a car club day. We are going to explain how it works with the help of Mark Walker from ZipCar UK. The plan would be to get1 million people signed up to a car club by 2025. That number at the moment is 11+5,000. On average, we use the carforfour moment is 11+5,000. On average, we use the car for four hours a week, so the plan would be to reduce congestion on the roads, to reduce pollution and to reduce cost. So explain how it works, Mark. Basics first. We put cars out all over London. There are 2500 car club cars around. That means everybody is never more than five minutes away from one of our cars. You can book any car that you want using an app or going online for the time that you need, and you only pay for the time that you need it. It is very easy. I spoke to people on the street who were not convinced about giving up their own private vehicles. How would you convince them? They do not really know how it works yet and how convenient it is. If they went online and investigated how close these cars are and how easy it is to use the app the book car round the corner, they will change their minds immediately. And when they realise that they will save around £3000 a year against owning a car, they start to get very interested. You mention the environmental impact. Why notjust encourage people to use public transport? That is exactly what our members do. It is why the city is backing the growth of car clubs to 1 million members. As a member, you also use public transport, cycling and walking much more than a car owner. That means that people are more thoughtful about when they drive, and only dried when you need to, so congestion and pollution are reduced. And congestion and pollution are big issues for London might now. Thank you very much. I have been talking to people on social media about this. Whilst people were positive about this scheme, some mentioned that they would not give up their private vehicle because of the convenience and the fact that they like having their own car. So it is fair to say that the argument is far from won. It’s one thing as a football fan to see your club win the Premier League, but imagine getting the chance to present the actual trophy to the captain. For one Chelsea fan - Rachel Key - that’s exactly what will happen this Sunday at Stamford Bridge and she’ll be the first fan to ever to do. She joins me now. A very warm A VâI’y WBFITI WâlCOITIâ smile on your face. Has it sunk in yet you are going to meet your idols? I don’t think that it will sink in until the day that that happens. So much has been done over the last two weeks. So much to take in. I have not had time for the Main Event to sink in. Going back to the start, how did this come about? Usually, it is a football official sponsor who does this. I was at Stamford Bridge at the beginning of the yearfor 12-15 weeks. Stamford Bridge at the beginning of the year for 12-15 weeks. Barclays approached a few tutors from Chelsea and asked them to put people forward with a short story about them, and they chose me. One of the reasons is because of your football coaching work. Can you tell us about that? I have all been interested in football. When I was younger it was about playing it, but now that I have got older, I would like to give back everything that I got as a child, I would like to give that back to the community. We know that you’ll dad is a massive fan. He must be jealous. you’ll dad is a massive fan. He must bejealous. He be jealous. He has not told me yet howjealousy is. I am sure that that drivers overtaking it, to be honest. Is it true that your middle name is Chelsea and that is his fault? Yes, he wanted my first name to be Chelsea, but my mum was not having any of that. She did not want her daughter to be named after a football club. Have you even thought about what you are going to see when you meetjohn Terry about what you are going to see when you meet john Terry face-to-face? The only thing I have thought about that day is, don’t drop that cup. That is the thing that goes through mY That is the thing that goes through my mind. I am going to have to say something, sol my mind. I am going to have to say something, so I will have to give it some thought. What is it about football that you love so much? I really don’t know. It is something that I have had a passion for, since I was a child. Ido not really like any other sport. It has literally just always been football. So, yeah. I will let that new sink in. We wish you all the best on Sunday. There will be lots ofjealous people, and lots of people wishing you luck on the day. For almost six decades the biggest names in music have gathered in central London to honour the year’s best song writers. Paul McCartney, Sting and Tinie Tempah are just a few of those to have received Ivor Novello Awards in the past. Today, the awards were presented for the 60th time. So who won? Our Entertainment Correspondent Brenda Emmanus can tell us. Above the clouds of Pompeii by London folk trio Bears Den, was nominated for the best song lyrically at the Ivor Novello awards. It is wonderful to be at an award that is voted for by songwriters. We feel very honoured to be here. The band have evolved from a support act to headlining their own gigs in America and sell-out shows on home turf. Sadly, they were beaten by Hoosier with his pit, take me to church. The Ivor Novello award celebrates the art and craft of British and Irish songwriting. It is the 60th year of this prestigious event in an injury that has changed significantly. But there is one constant, says Brian May from Queen. Without a song you’re wasting your time. It is key to what we do. And we were singer-songwriter performance, but it singer-songwriter performance, but it is not always the case, so that celebrates everybody who writes a great song. The romantic notion of an artist writing and producing songs solo has changed. Today, it is more of a collaborative affair. Sam Smith were multi-million selling it, but one is credited with five composers, including the man of the moment, james Napier. I think I work very hard for a long time and people only see the end product when you win awards. But I worked for ten years making no money and trying to get a break. And I consider myself to be extremely fortunate to be able to be a songwriter for a living. Boy George was honoured for outstanding contribution to British music. It was 1+0 years ago that daredevil Evel Knievel attempted to jump over thirteen London buses at Wembley Stadium. But he failed to clear the final bus and crashed in front 90,000 people, fracturing his pelvis and breaking his hand. His son - Kenny Knievel - has been speaking to BBC London about his father’s unusual career, while our sports reporter Sara Orchard has been to meet some of the fans who were there that day and regard Knievel as their hero. To many, the American daredevil accurately was a real life superhero with scant regard for his own personal safety. with scant regard for his own personalsafety. If personal safety. If you ask somebody 1+0 years later that knew him, you could tell that they are still on the edge of their seat when they hear this term, Evel Knievel. He moved people. He was an inspirational figure. moved people. He was an inspirationalfigure. In a moved people. He was an inspirational figure. In a career lasting 15 years, he made 175jumps with a landing success rate of close to 95%. In 1975, the epitome of don’t try this at home, he tried and failed tojump over 30 buses at Wembley Stadium. Despite suffering multiple injuries including a fractured pelvis, he told his team, I came in walking, I went out walking. And he dressed the crowd. I would like to tell you that you are the last people in the world who will ever see mejump. They were aged between seven and 12 when the big day came along but they remember it like it was yesterday. He was my boyhood hero. Simple as that. A true life superhero. It was my birthday treat. My dad knew how much I did. I had had the start by the year before. It was like waiting for Father Christmas. It was just that kind of feeling. just waiting. And then suddenly, this massive roar filled the stadium. Evel Knievel was mY filled the stadium. Evel Knievel was my hero. Me and my friends were just post rock -- we were just awestruck. This guy almost trying to kill himself in front of 100,000 people. The memorabilia collected by the five men includes the helmet worn on the day but probably the most the more your item is this. He had the biggest selling toy in the world. Almost every kid had either a Evel Knievel wind-up motorcycle or Evel Knievel lunchbox full stop they were the biggest selling toys in the world. They were very popular. And in case you didn’t know, of course, Evel Knievel did jump again. And you can watch the documentary ""I Am Evel Knievel"" next Friday, 29th May, at 9pm on the Quest Channel. Let’s get a check on the weather with Chris Fawkes. Nice to see that it is warming up. This is how the day panned out. Sunshine in London. Some Fairweather Cloud, melting away to leave a fine evening. Temperatures, 20 Celsius, a little above average for the time of year. It is the first time I have said that this week. In the next 21+ hours, some doubt about how quickly this cloud to the north-west is going to work his way towards cars. Overnight tonight we are looking at clear skies. Overnight tonight we are looking at clearskies. -- clear skies. -- towards others. -- towards but one. For Friday, it should be fine, sunny start to the day for most of us, but we expect cloud to build in as we head through the day. Most of the day will be dry. Then we have a few showers working in late on. By and large, a dry, bright start to the day. We will see cloud moving in from the North and West, but remaining dry until the evening, and temperatures, highs of around 21 Celsius, similar to the temperatures today. That is how the weather is shaping up. You can see more on the stories on our website, and we will be back with the ten o’clock news.

On BBC London. A coroner contradicts German police on howjeremiah Duggan from Golders Green died - saying it wasn’t suicide. And sub-standard homes for rent. The dangers being faced by tenants. Good evening. The government’s aim of drastically reducing immigration suffered another setback today after new figures showed a surge in the numbers coming to Britain. Net migration, that’s the number of people arriving in the UK minus the number leaving, has risen to 318,000. That’s the highest level for a decade. The government says it remains committed reducing the number to ""tens of thousands"" and it’s unveiled new measures aimed at tackling illegal immigration. Our Deputy Political Editorjames Landale has more details. This is what the battle against illegal immigration on the front line looks like. A police raid on a house in West London, where illegal immigrants were thought to be living. A raid the cameras and the Prime Minister, whose bigger problem today was not migrants who come here illegally but those who come fully within the law. The latest figures show that while 320,000 people left the UK last year, an extraordinary 641,000 came in. A massive increase from the year before. Of those, 290,000 came from outside of the EU, 268,000 from within Europe. Figures that leave David Cameron’s target of reducing net migration to the tens of thousands in tatters. It’s disappointing we have not made more progress but I take the figures as a clear instruction to deliver and deliver faster. So, today the Prime Minister gathered hundreds of civil servants to the Home Office to promise once again to cut migration and set out new plans to stem the flow. This isn’t about simply having better border controls it’s about making sure that if people are here illegally it is not as easy to use the health service service, get a council house, have a job, have a driving licence. You have to deal with each and everyone of those things. So, he promised a new Immigration Bill in next week’s Queen’s Speech, including new powers to seize the wages of illegal workers and deport them more quickly. A ban on firms recruiting overseas without advertising in the UK. And a plan to reduce significantly the number of skilled workers from outside of the EU and... Changes to welfare to cut EU migration will be an absolute requirement in my renegotiation. In recent years Wrexham has seen some of the largest increases in Easter Europeans in Wales. Theyjust can’t getjobs, the youngsters can’t. I have no objection to them coming but they need to be kept, don’t they? As long as they are coming to work, that’s all right, but I’ve met a lot that aren’t coming here to work, that’s the trouble. Maybe if we limited it a birth and forced our own to work, Maybe if we limited it a bit then we wouldn’t have as many people claiming benefits. Ukip said that free labour movement from Europe had to be stopped, Labour said the Tories were copying their plans to protect low-paid migrants. David Cameron’s hopes of reducing migration rest in part on persuading EU leaders to let him cut the benefits of their nationals when they come to this country, that will be no easy task but it is one that the Prime Minister will begin at an EU summit tomorrow. And our Europe Editor Katya Adler is in Riga for that EU summit. Katya will The Prime Minister get a sympathetic hearing on the issue of immigration? Well, he is expected here in Riga in a few hours’ Well, he is expected here in Riga in a few hours’ time. Tomorrow is the first time he meets EU leaders since his election. They are very cures: Britain now for certain will hold a referendum, and David Cameron for certain wants to change Britain’s relationship with the EU but how? That is what the leaders want to know. This is really the beginning. But today details were made clear by the Prime Minister on immigration. If presented as an EU-wide reform, it is thought that the UK has the support of countries like Germany, Austria and the Netherlands, especially when it comes to the idea of newcomers accessing benefits or cracking down on illegal workers but when it comes to the Prime Minister’s desire to differ enSecretary of State the access to tax credit between UK workers and EU workers, it is likely to cause up roar. It goes against the fundamental EU right for citizens to work anywhere in the European Union. The Prime Minister appears to have stepped back from calling for a block on the freedom of movement, Germany and others would not countenance that but the tax credit issueis countenance that but the tax credit issue is likely to cause big problems. Thomas Cook says two hotel staff convicted in connection with the deaths of two British children have been found working in hotels where the company sends holidaymakers. Bobby and Christi Shepherd were killed by carbon monoxide poisoning while on a holiday in Corfu in 2006. Earlier today, it was revealed their family will receive a ""financial gesture of goodwill"" from the tour operator. Kamal Ahmed reports. Christi and Bobby Shepherd, two children, faces now a marker of all thatis children, faces now a marker of all that is wrong in a relationship between a global corporation and family grief. Today after nine years of waiting the parents finally met the people in charge of Thomas Cook. The mothers said that they were the underdogs up against a corporate giant. . Nothing can give us back our children or the care free lives we once led. No-one can erase the life long pain for Christi and Bobby’s family and friends. We cannot change the past. The father said that Thomas Cook would make donations to a series of charities close to the family’s heart. To the British Heart Foundation and the NSPCC a charity that had a special place in Christi and Bobby’s heart. After arriving to meet the family, the chief executive of Thomas Cook told me he was deeply sorry and the company had failed to show compassion. The tragedy happened in 2006 it is now 2015, why has it taken Thomas Cook so long to meet the family? That is what I regret, that I was not meeting and trying to meet them at the very beginning when I took overin at the very beginning when I took over in November, 2014. To be honest, that should have happened long before but this is exactly what, probably was my biggest mistake. But tonight, more controversy, two hotel workers convicted following the deaths of Christi and Bobby were discoffered to be working in hotels used by Thomas Cook. One was that man, the manager of the hotel where the children died. When he found out, the Thomas Cook chief executive said he felt physically sick. . When I was aware of it, we reacted really fast. The hotel manager was out yesterday evening. I have finished visiting the head of Thomas Cook here. The words of contrition were sad and genuine but this is a company that has a long way to go to rebuild public trust. Christi and Bobby’s parents want the bungalow where they died to be turned into a memorial playground. The tragedy here has seen a family who had to battle for years for a company to recognise their loss. Record damages totalling more than a million pounds have been awarded to eight people whose phones were hacked by the Mirror group of I’IâWSp8pâI’S. The actress Sadie Frost and the former footballer Paul Gascoigne were among the celebrities set to receive six-figure sums after their voicemails were routinely listened to byjournalists overa numberof years. Our Correspondent David Sillito was in court. Sadie Frost arrived in court today forjudgment on five years of torment. Her medical records, her children’s lives, her mental health, visits to Alcoholics Anonymous, all appeared in the Mirror, she thought it was her friends betraying her. When you lose trust in your friends, yourfamily, you know, you begin to... You know, it’s a very lonely place to be. These are record payouts. Paul Gascoigne was hacked for nine years, he received more than £188,000. Coronation Street’s Shobna Gulati, over £117,000. Sadie Frost, more than £206,000. And EastEnders, Lucy Benjamin, £157,000. For seven years the hacking took place, I’m just glad its all over. And for years the Mirror Group denied there was any evidence of hacking. But what’s emerged here is the fact that the Mirror was hacking phones on a daily basis and notjust intercepting voicemail messages. It was accessing confidential details, medical records and that was going on for more than ten years. E-mails were written in code, the ""muppets"" were the hackers, one journalist was making 60 to 100 calls a day. What is uncertain is how many claims will now come. Score, certainly, possibly hundreds. This is a legal landmark, the question is how far has the culture changed? Now full hacking is, hopefully history, what is going replace it?, history what is going replace it? The competition is still there, journalists are under severe pressure to go out and get that script and the question is can they and will they all do it within the law? As the victims left, Mirror Group was pondering an appeal. It was thought that £12 million would cover the cost, that figure went up today by an extra £16 million. And criminal charges are also being considered. Eight men charged in connection with the Hatton Garden jewellery raid have appeared in court today. They’re aged between 48 and 76, and accused of conspiracy to burgle. Detectives say valuables worth more than ten million pounds were stolen. Our correspondent Sarah Campbell has more details. The journey to court was as high-profile as this case has become. The convoy of police vans transported the eight suspects through London’s streets. The photographers keen to get a glimpse of the alleged burglars. Some of them were caught on camera inside the vans. But it was inside the courtroom as the men took their seats in the dock that the reason that the case has remained in the headlines became clear. Reflecting their advancing years, most had greying or white hair, two seemed to have hearing issues, finding it difficult to hear the questions. The oldest was 76-year-old Brian Reader from Dartford in Kent in the brown top. Next to him, 74-year-old john Collins. Three of the group were of pensionable age. All are charged with conspiring to carry out a raid at this safety deposit security company, in London’sjewellery district in Hatton Garden. It’s believed that the premises were entered via a lift shaft. A hole was then drilled through the 50cm deep vault wall and over the course of the bank holiday weekend, the contents of more than 70 deposit boxes were stolen. On Tuesday the Flying Squad carried out a series of co-ordinated raids across London and Kent, arrests were made and the police said that they believed that items seized had been taken from the Hatton Garden safety deposits. In total the police have arrested ten men in connection with the raid. The eight who appeared here earlier today, were remanded in custody and are scheduled to appear at Southwark Crown Court on june the 4th. The extremist group Islamic State has captured the Syrian town of Palmyra. There are reports of executions, many residents have fled, and there are fears for the town’s world-famous archaeological treasures. In Iraq, thousands of people are fleeing from Ramadi, which also fell to IS fighters in recent days. Our World Affairs Editorjohn Simpson reports from Baghdad. With this latest success, capturing not just the historic city of Palmyra but the important Al-Hail gasfield outside it, the self-styled Islamic State now controls 50% of Syria’s territory. The sheer savagery of IS has worked superbly well. It paralyses its enemies with terror. ""We are coming for you,"" he says, with disturbing calm. ""With men who love death as much as you love life, you will never be safe as long as we are alive."" Palmyra, one of the world’s great classical cities, is now defenceless. When it can, Islamic State destroys all vestiges of the non-Islamic past. The speed of the IS advance has been quite extraordinary. Yesterday it was Palmyra. Four days ago, it gained the important town of Ramadi in Western Iraq. A vast flood of terrified refugees pours along the roads out of Ramadi. Desperate to escape the vengeance of Islamic State. A mere 200 IS fighters captured the town, chasing out ten times that number of Iraqi soldiers. The people of the town feel utterly abandoned. This woman screams at the BBC... ""The government has let us down."" All that is only 60 miles away. Yet Baghdad feels calm and pretty relaxed tonight. Almost two thirds of the Iraqi army is based in and around the capital to protect it. The fall of Ramadi has given people a scare here, though the anxiety has started to fade now. But there is a definite feeling that the Iraqi army let the country down. While in America, some people are starting to blame it all on US policy. And yet Western officials here are confident that IS can and will be beaten. They believe Ramadi will be recaptured within weeks. Even so, the last few days have been a nasty shock. jon Sopel, what is the White House saying about the situation in the Middle East? I have to say, it is as defensive as I have heard the president’s spokesman being. He spoke about their being a dynamic between progress and setback. While saying that Palmyra and Ramadi were setbacks, he said there had been progress as well. But the things he pointed to where things which had happened in the past. There is great criticism of the strategy, but nobody is coming up with an alternative. There is no way that President Obama is going to send 150,000 troops to invade Iraq again and invade Syria. So you are left with the existing strategy, with perhaps a bit of amplification. He said at the outset that the twin strategy was to degrade and destroy IS. The spokesman admitted this afternoon that destroying IS was not going to happen while this president was in the White House, and so you are left with the more modest aim of degrading, and that is still a long way off. 21 countries around the world have legalised same-sex marriage, but never before has it been put to a popular vote. Tomorrow, a referendum will decide Ireland’s approach, with all of the Republic’s main political parties calling for a yes. But the Catholic Church is opposed to any change, and as our Ireland correspondent Chris Buckler reports, Ireland’s church and state are battling for every last vote. In Ireland, the referendum about marriage has sparked a debate about equality and what makes a modern family. From shopping centres to the streets, Yes campaigners are trying to persuade people to vote in favour of allowing two men or two women to marry. When you fall in love with someone, there are like these natural steps. And my natural next step with my beautiful partner would be to ask her to marry me. Among the supporters of the Yes campaign are celebrities, sports stars and politicians from all of Ireland’s main parties. But among the most vocal opponents to any change in the definition of marriage is the Catholic Church - and in Ireland, that still matters. It is away from the cities, in rural towns and villages, where that concern about change is strongest. Here in County Donegal, most people leaving morning Mass indicated that they would be voting No. I totally believe in equality for gay people and I do not have a problem with that - but I also believe in equality for children, and I think it is their right to grow up with a mother and a father. Issues surrounding religion and children have waded into this referendum. Issues surrounding religion and children have wedded In Ireland, the family is protected as a moral institution in law. The introduction of same-sex marriage would require a change to the constitution, which is why there has to be a public vote. This phrase, same-sex marriage, there is no such thing. Same-sex relations, certainly, marriage, certainly. Together, it is like water and oil, they don’t mix. Modern Ireland remains a Catholic country. But on this issue, people hold different beliefs. Tom Curran is the general secretary of Ireland’s main government party, Fine Gael, and a devout Catholic. And one of his three sons is gay. I want our people to say, this guy is equal to my two sons, my daughter, or to anybody else. He is trying to relay a message to other Catholics like him to vote yes, and I think it is absolutely amazing what he’s doing, and I’m so proud of him for doing it. It means so much to me. And it’s as important to you as a father? This is fundamental to me as a father. Fundamental. There is nothing, you know - if you say you love somebody, you have to do it. And this is doing it. It is only 22 years since homosexuality was officially decriminalised in Ireland. In cities like Dublin, there is a clear confidence among the gay and lesbian community. However, this referendum will be decided by voters from right across this country. A taxi driver from north-west London has been found guilty of the murder of a US soldier in Iraq in a roadside bombing eight years ago. Anis Sardar, who is 38 and from Wembley, built bombs as part of a campaign to kill Americans fighting in the country. Daniel Sandford reports. Today, Anis Sardar became the first man to be found guilty by a British court of murdering a US soldier in Iraq. It was during the so-called surge in 2007. US soldiers were trying to help the new government in Baghdad deal with Al-Qaeda in a rack and found themselves as targets. The bomb which blew a hole through the bottom of this armoured vehicle killed Sergeant First Class Randy johnson. It was made by Anis Sardar. But amazingly, the Americans stored every bomb they found in Iraq and Afghanistan in this warehouse in Virginia, and poured overthem Afghanistan in this warehouse in Virginia, and poured over them for fingerprints. Anis Sardar’s prints were found on two devices linked to the bomb which killed Sergeant johnson. He was tracked down to Wembley, and today, a South London iurv Wembley, and today, a South London jury convicted him. He has reinvented himself as a black cab driver in the last few years, but in reality, he is a bomb maker, here’s a terrorist, and this conviction says he is also guilty of murder. Within months of returning from Syria, and his arm making exploits in Iraq, he was here at Feltham Young Offenders Institution, but not as an inmate, he was working with the Muslim chaplain, teaching young offenders. Records show that he was invited through the prison gates three times over the next four years. Scotland Yard said Anis Sardar’s conviction showed they will pursue anyone for terrorist acts, anywhere in the world, no matter how long afterwards. He will be sentenced tomorrow. The Conservatives’ unexpectedly decisive win at the general election came in part due to some stunning successes against their former coalition partners, the Liberal Democrats. They were completely wiped out in the south-west of England, losing every one of their 15 seats to the Tories. In the second in a series looking behind the election result, our chief political correspondent Vikki Young examines why former Liberal Democrat voters deserted their party. Across the Somerset plains, through the rolling Devon hills towards the coastal towns of Cornwall - this was the closest there was to a Liberal Democrat heartland. Not any more. To many, the scale of the Conservative victory was a surprise, but not to those who had spent months campaigning in the south-west. I kept telling people back in London until I was blue in the face that we were seeing a blue tide sweep up the peninsula in the south-west. And again, that was happily correct because it probably got us our overall majority in Parliament. And so, the Conservative election strategy was born. They had no qualms about targeting their coalition partners. David Cameron and other senior ministers made repeated visits to the area. As the campaign wore on, their ambitions grew. Seats which had seemed beyond them were now in play. Torbay was one of them. The Lib Dems had held this seat for 18 years and they were banking on voters staying loyal to their sitting MP. But when it came to it, the so-called incumbency factor was not enough to counteract the party’s unpopularity nationally. People were looking for something different, in the Greens, in Ukip, and even in Labour, which was perhaps speaking more to them than we were able to. And we were not able to because we had been fighting for the previous five years with one hand tied behind our back being in coalition with the Conservatives. The story of what happened on election day in the south-west is pretty dramatic. The Liberal Democrat vote completely collapsed, and it splintered, too. Some of it went to Labour, to Ukip and to the Greens. It allowed the Conservatives, with a fairly modest rise in their vote, to win almost every seat. Conservative strategists had always hoped this election would be like 1992, where they could win over floating voters in a close race between them and an unpopular Labour leader. Over the years, the Liberal Democrats persuaded people here in the south-west to vote for them as the main opposition to the Conservatives. But once the two parties went into coalition together, that was always going to be much harder. The Tories saw this weakness and targeted seats here to win the general election outright. And there was one message which cut through more than any other. About one in three people that you spoke to on the doorstep would have raised the spectre of either a very London-based Labour government or a government in coalition with the SNP - neither of which were appealing to south-west voters. The Conservatives struck gold in the West Country, and they are confident they have seen off the Liberal Democrat challenge for years.

On tonight’s BBC London. Over a decade after the German police concluded jeremiah Duggan from Golders Green committed suicide, a coroner here disagrees - and the students mother speaks out. Well, a very powerful statement has been made by the coroner. We hope it will be his legacy. Sub-standard and dangerous homes for rent. A demand for tougher laws to protect tenants. The Ivor Novellos in their 60th year, still drawing-in the biggest names in music. We have a report on the winners. And with more good weather to come, a full forecast later. Good evening, I’m Asad Ahmad. jeremiah Duggan from Golders Green was found dead in Germany over a decade ago. His body was discovered on a motorway in the west of the country, in Weisbaden, after which the authorities there concluded he’d committed suicide. Today, a coroner in North London disagreed, to the relief of the Duggan family. Tarah Welsh reports The smiling, happy 22-year-old student, whose parents have maintained would not commit suicide. 12 years on a coroner agreed. jeer mire Duggan went to a dmfrns Germany, organised by a political movement. After a few days he was found dead on a motorway. Shortly before he had called his mother, saying he was terrified. Two policemen came to the door. They walked through and said your son is dead and that he committed suicide. In 2003, German police looking into the death said it was suicide. That same year, a British inquest said it was not. In 2010, the High Court ordered a fresh UK inquest, two years later, the German higher court ruled that the original investigation was flawed. This inquest heard from a cult expert, saying that the Larousche organisation was dressed as a left-wing group when in fact it was a far-right cult. She said that the group put members under extreme psychological pressure and experts say that the group held extreme anti-Semitic views. It was said. The coroner rejected evidence saying he was killed elsewhere, and the collision staged. Other witnesses said they had seen Mr Duggon trying tojump in front of said they had seen Mr Duggon trying to jump in front of cars. tojump in front of cars. In recording a narrative verdict, Andrew Walker said he accepted the evidence of the drivers but said he rejected that this was suicide. He said that Mr Duggan may have been at risk from members which may have caused him to become distressed and seeking to leave. He added there may have been an altercation. A powerful statement has been made by the coroner, which we hope will be our son’s leg sassy, that students are warned against the dangers of these extremist groups that target students. At times like this, when you have to go back there and go through it is quite hard. Yes, it is gruelling. The German investigation remains open. The family believe that there are still many questions that need answering. The Bank Holiday rail strike may-be off, but a Tube strike could be around the corner. The train drivers union, ASLEF has announced a ballot for their members on the London Underground - in a row over pay involving new ‘all-night’ services. ACAS, is planned for next month. Hundreds, if not thousands of tenants in London, could be renting homes which are sub-standard or even dangerous to live in. Citizen Advice has found landlords cashing in on properties which have rats, severe damp, or even where there’s a risk of explosions. The charity wants to see tighter controls in place and tougher sentences for those breaching the law, as Ayshea Buksh reports. These are the conditions some Londoners are paying hundreds of pounds a week to live in. Damp, inpested and dangerous. This woman and her daughter once lived in a rented flat in Hackney. There was raw sewage in the basement and a life current in the bathroom. I was electrocuted in the shower. That is as a fault I had previously reported eight or nine months prior, had not been maintained correctly or fixed. Unauthorised personnel had come to fix it and left in a worse state than before. Citizens Advice Bureau say that the number of people renting and the problems with homes is unthe rise. We looked at the state of private rented stock in England and found that three-quarters of I rented stock in England and found that three-quarters of1 million households are unsafe. They are dangerous, they should not be let out to individuals. Including in thatis out to individuals. Including in that is half a million children living in the households. That is scandalous and something should be done about it. But, the national landlords Association disputes the figures. I think that the report is biassed. There are a small minority of landlords that keep the conditions in poor condition but it is small. The vast majority of landlords have good conditions and rent good quality homes. But what can be done about rogue landlords who operate under the radar? Some have a compulsory licences scheme for landlords. It is estimated that £1 billion of benefit has been spent on dangerous homes. Generation Rent believe that cost to the taxpayer could have a better use. USE. At use. At the moment, the taxpayer through Housing Benefit is subsidising a huge number of private landlords. We would like to see a taxation of the rent that the private landlords charge in order to ring-fence a house fund for social housing to help the tennants who should be in social housing. Layla was evicted when she complained. She is now living in a new, safer home. There’s a push to get us Londoners to give up our cars - in order to put the needs of the city first. Transport bosses have got their eye on getting a million of us, to start sharing cars - as they say, it makes financial and environmental sense for us all. Marc Ashdown has more details. Talk to anyone that drives around London, they will tell you there are too many of these things down the street, cars. Drive forward one of theseit street, cars. Drive forward one of these it looks like a car, it feels like a car... Well it is a car but with a difference. Thousands of people could use this each year. It is part of a car club. Members sign UP is part of a car club. Members sign up and hire it for hours or days at a time. The idea to get accounts us out of the cars into these. The RAC found that 85% of car club members live in London but the target is to get1 million car club members by 2025. Here is a sat, the average city car is drive be li. 6 hours a week, so 97% of the time your car is sat in the drive or the street. If they were to go online and investigate where their closest cars are and how easy it is to use the GPP are and how easy it is to use the app and book the car, they will change their minds immediately. And once they realise that they can save £3,000 versus owning a car they start to get interested indeed. £3,000. You can go online or download an app and you are away. There are more and more car, the idea being that no-one is more than five minutes away from a car club car. They are a cut in pollution, congestion and costs. Some will always want to own their own car but the idea is to get one in ten Londoners into a car share in the next ten years. What a great series. One of the most prestigious music awards in the world are the Ivor Novello’s - or ‘The Ivors’ for short. The Beatles won a clutch of them - while David Bowie, Adele and Tiny Tempah have them too. But today was special- as it was the 60th ceremony and our Arts Correspondent, Brenda Emmanus was there. Her report does contain flash photography. # Walking through the town. Above the Clouds of pop pie, by London folk trio, the single nominated for best song and music, at today’s I’ve yore Novello awards. It was voted for us, so we are feeling very honoured.

The Ivors celebrate the arts and the craft of British and Irish song writing. The 60th year in an industry that has changed significantly. # Stay with me... The romantic notion of an artist writing and producing songs solo has changed. Today it is more of a collaborative affair. Sam Smith’s multimillion selling hit, Stay With Me, is exited to five composures, including james Napier. Today he picked up two Best Songs for his band, Bandit. I have worked hard for a long time. People see the end product. But I worked for ten years trying to make and getting a break. I consider myself fortunate to be able to be a songwriter for a living and myself fortunate to be able to be a songwriterfor a living and call songwriter for a living and call it mY songwriter for a living and call it my career. I never take it for granted. Boy George was back at the Ivors to be honoured for his outstanding contribution to music. It is not about who is selling the most records who, is popular, it is about your work. I have two, so this is the big one. With Ed sheeran, Sir Bob gel to have and Midge Ure, generations of literary writers had much to celebrate -- literary writers had much to celebrate -- Sheeran and Sir Bob Geldof. Now, let’s get the weather forecast with Phil. Tonight clear skies. The temperatures dipping to two or three Celsius. In the north not a cold night. But the cloud is working in. A dry commute tomorrow. But as the day goes on, the cloud filling in the north and the east. Maybe a spot of rain. Where we keep the sunshine it is in the upper teens, up to 21 Celsius. Saturday, we are just beginning to see something a little bit drier but cooler perhaps there. The top temperature of 19 and then as we move into Sunday, well, we are going to see a dry start and then the rain moving in from the north. A wet end to the day and then we shall now leave it to Sarah Keith Luka to bring you the rest of the holiday weekend. ~ Ican I can promise i CBFI pI’OITIiSâ yOU one of the bank holiday days. But before we get there, there is cloud and rain to get out of the way for the next 24 hours. Cloud in the north and the west. The rain fairly light and patchy here.
