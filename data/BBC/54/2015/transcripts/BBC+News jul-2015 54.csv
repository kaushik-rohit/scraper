In Greece, the polls have closed in the crucial referendum on whether to accept a new international bailout package. Turnout is reported to be high. The governing Syriza party has urged people to vote no, saying the terms of the deal are humiliating. But the vote yes campaign is warning Greek banks are on the verge of running out of money, and the country could be forced out of the Eurozone. Our Europe Editor Katya Adler is in Athens for us this evening. Over the last week since this referendum was called, we have been saying how momentous it is, notjust for Greeks before the Eurozone, and thatis for Greeks before the Eurozone, and that is why it is being watched so closely from outside Greece. There is apparently, according to some opinion polls, a victory for the Greek Prime Minister’s no vote. But it is important that when the result is confirmed, it is interpreted correctly. If it is confirmed, then what it is is a vote in of confidence in the Greek Prime Minister, a no vote for posterity without hope such as debt relief. It is not a vote by the Greek people to leave the Eurozone. The majority of Greeks want to stay in the single currency but their partners in the Eurozone will not be pleased by a novelty, if it is confirmed. A warning that this report contains some flashing photography. A moment of calm contemplation before the political storm. After praying for the health of loved ones and a better future for their country, the faithful in this Athens church were heading to vote in a referendum that has the rest of Europe holding its breath. TRANSLATION: I am very worried. My pension was cut in half. How can a country survive with no food and no education? Is this Europe? Greece’s Prime Minister called today’s referendum partly to change the way that Europe is governed, to make it fairer for that Europe is governed, to make it fairerfor ordinary fairer for ordinary people. Today he voted no to the demands from those lending Greece money and asked his countrymen to do the same. It is a controversial move in and outside of Greece. The Prime Minister’s bodyguards were clearly concerned for his safety. Alexis Tsipras is the divisive man of the moment. But now he is the saviour of Greek national pride for some but seen as a troublemaker by others. For many, this is not a vote about austerity, it is a yes or no for the Prime Minister and his plans for Europe. Greek society has been politicised by this economic crisis. Apathy reigns in many other European countries on voting day but here young and old streamed into polling stations. You could feel a sense of urgency. Of history in the making. How are you feeling? I am frustrated and anxious. Ido not know How are you feeling? I am frustrated and anxious. I do not know what is going to happen tomorrow or the day after. It is an important day for our country because we face a crisis every day. And it is very important to vote for our history. With polling stations now closed, supporters of the Greek Prime Minister are beginning to gather in central Athens. Minister are beginning to gather in centralAthens. Hope central Athens. Hope this coming is one of their favourite slogans. But banks remain shut here and they are running out of money. Worrying times lie ahead. Whatever the final referendum result. Our Economics Editor Robert Peston joins us from Athens now. Very early indications are that the no camp may have triumphed here. In the short term, what does that mean? Well, let’s be clear, this likely no vote came against it terrible banking and economic backdrop. I have been told by authoritative sources that Greek banks are within days of running out of cash in spite of the fact that they were effectively closed last Monday. Such has been the speed with which Greek people have withdrawn the small amount of cash that they have been allowed to do. That means that according to the bankers I have been speaking to, and they use to this exact phrase, that Greece is facing a potential humanitarian disaster. Why is that? The banks are unable to facilitate overseas payment and companies cannot find the vital raw materials they need. So companies may well lay off more workers as soon as tomorrow. The hospital service fears that it will run out of medicine because again they cannot be imported in scale. Banks are tellingly that there has to be a way of providing emergency lending to them so that they can prevent the economy from imploding. Right now the European Central Bank is very unlikely to do that. And that is why I have been extraordinarily struck that bankers are talking openly for the first time that it might be the right thing for Greece to leave the euro so that the bank of Greece can create vital new money to lend to them to prevent an economic catastrophe here. Robert, thank you. The Chancellor George Osborne has been outlining details of the government’s planned £12 billion in welfare cuts, ahead of the budget on Wednesday. He said he plans to lower the cap on the total amount of benefits some households receive, and those on high incomes living in social housing will have to start paying closer to the market rental rate. Here’s our Political Correspondent Alex Forsyth. It is the first all Conservative budget for more than 18 years. And the Chancellor is expected to reveal long-awaited details of £12 billion of welfare cuts. George Osborne, unfettered by Lib Dems in coalition, can press on with Tory principles and promises a fairer system for working people. It is not fair, for example, that people out of work can earn more than people in work. So we will cut the benefit cap as we said in our manifesto, £223,000 in London, and lower in the rest the country. It is thought that the cap for places outside of London like Manchester will be £20,000 perhaps hold. For some, it could mean a cut in benefits of up to £6,000 a year. If they cut benefits, I might have to move. I would be If they cut benefits, I might have to move. Iwould be in a high-rise block with loads of whatever. No matter what they do, it will hit the working class. I think it is reasonable. £28,000 is a lot of money. The Chancellor has hinted at other areas that could be cut to find the £12 billion of savings. He said that tax credits used to top up earnings for the low-paid are very expensive and the housing benefit bill needs to be looked at. And it is thought he wants the BBC to pay for the cost of free TV licences for the over 70 fires, which could be up to £75 million. Experts say these measures could have significant impact, particularly as the Chancellor has ruled out savings like cuts of the lie for pensioners. Given what the Chancellor has said he wants to protect, £12 billion is a large portion of the Social Security budget, 10%. To get there, you need to make significant cuts to some of the big benefits, housing benefit and tax credits, that affect people on low income. Labour has questioned the government’s priorities and warned that the most vulnerable must be protected. The Chancellor claims he is putting work over welfare in the first budget which will only reflect his vision for the country. Princess Charlotte has been christened at a private ceremony on the Sandringham estate. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge chose five godparents for the baptism, including William’s cousin Laura Fellowes. It was the family’s first public outing together since her birth in May. Our Royal Correspondent Nicholas Witchell reports. Afamily A family force in their Sunday best. On an afternoon stroll to church. Mum, dad, Big Brother George in the bright red shorts, and in a pram which once belonged to the Queen, a baby whose christening this pause. George, not surprisingly, looked bemused and curious. Why, he seemed to be wondering, is that man in a suit following me? And why are all these people staring and waving. Blissfully unaware of it all was the occupant of the pram, Charlotte, two months old, making her first public appearance since the day of her birth on May the 2nd.

Lewis Hamilton has won his third British Grand Prix and stretched his championship lead to seventeen points. It was a very familiar result with a Mercedes 1-2 yet again but that doesn’t tell half the story. Patrick Gearey reports from Silverstone The place of the British Grand Prix in our landscape is such that Silverstone has become a golden ticket. It record crowd looked for any place to watch. 140,000 people take up the vantage point around Silverstone, attracted by cheaper tickets on offer and perhaps by the chance to watch Lewis Hamilton win a third British Grand Prix. He began on pole position but after a week in which Formula 1 was called predictable, the start of the race was anything but. Williams, with both cards beaten by Mercedes! In a blur, Hamilton’s lead was gone. Further back, jenson Button’s problems were greater, his British Grand Prix did not last lap, hit by Fernando Alonso. Hamilton pressed fast forward, perhaps too hastily. Going for first comedy fell to third. The plan failed. Foranother. Hamilton swaps tires in the pits and returned faster. He went second and when Valtteri Bottas pitted, he emerged to find Hamilton in front of them. The home favourite moved further ahead but as he did so, rain moved towards the surface. Gathering clouds, gathering thoughts. Rain tests skills and tyres. Hamilton picked just the right moment to change tyres and it was the decision that ran -- change tyres and it was the decision that ran -- that won him the race. By the time the rain finished, Lewis Hamilton was about to. Lewis Hamilton wins the British Grand Prix. The result the crowd wanted, a race decided in the wet, celebrating by getting wetter. Mark Cavendish missed out on a 26th career stage win at the Tour de France despite putting himself in a perfect position today Cavendish, on the right, just ran out of steam in a sprint finish at the end of the second stage from Utrecht to Zeland in the Netherlands.

3,BBC1 London,5-jul-2015,BBC News,22:20,20 mins,True,"Greece has voted overwhelmingly to reject the terms of an international bail out deal in a crucial referendum, taking the country a step closer to leaving the euro. There’s jubilation as the Greek Prime Minister says he now has a clear mandate to return to the negotiating table, backed by a majority of the people. It’s not only a victory of the Greek people today - it’s a victory for all the people of Europe. We’ll be asking what next for Greece, as France and Germany call for an emergency summit of eurozone leaders. Also on the programme: As he prepares for the first Conservative Budget in 18 years, George Osborne says he knows where to cut £12 billion from welfare. Princess Charlotte has been christened in a private ceremony on the Sandringham Estate. Lewis Hamilton wins the British Grand Prix. And the reigning World Champion, after a bad start and bad weather, triumphs at Silverstone. Good evening. The people of Greece have overwhelmingly rejected the terms of an international bailout package, putting Athens on a collision course with eurozone leaders. In a decisive referendum with most of the votes counted, more than 60% said no to the deal. Thousands of people are now on the streets celebrating. It’s a victory for the governing Syriza party, whose leader Alexis Tsipras now wants to negotiate a new bail out agreement, and insisting tonight’s vote didn’t mean Greece would leave the euro. Our Europe Editor Katya Adler is there for us now. You talk about celebrations, and what celebrations. The final result, as you say, has to be confirmed, but it appears like an overwhelming majority for the no vote, meaning millions of Greeks decided to support their controversial Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, in saying no to Greece’s creditors, no to more austerity without any sign of hope, like reducing Greece’s enormous debt. The party you see below me in the square has a dampener on it because there’s a huge looming, which is what next. Greece has to wait for a reaction from its eurozone partners and the IMF. Will they choose to lend Greece more money and what conditions will they say needs to be attached? There are mutterings from the financial markets saying with its huge no vote Greece may have taken a large step closer to falling out of the eurozone, something the overwhelming majority of Greeks don’t want. There was quite some celebration in Athens tonight. Greece’s no voters felt proud of themselves. They stood UP felt proud of themselves. They stood up to date about country’s powerful creditors, the IMF and European Union. After five years of austerity misery, their message was clear. No more. But what now? I don’t know what is in my country tomorrow. I don’t know. I hope they come to a compromise but I don’t know. No money. ITIOI’Iây. TRANSLATIONZ money. TRANSLATION: No money, we were hungry before and we will stay hungry but we stood up to Angela Merkel. The no voters here are delighted to have got their voice of protest heard. Behind the music and celebration is a sense of confusion and they fear whatever Greeks voted today, the vast majority want to stay inside the eurozone. But will that be possible? Greek banks are shut and are fast running out of money and no one knows what’ll happen. Coverage of the referendum was self-conscious and dramatic. Greece knows the rest of Europe is watching, with bated breath. The impacts will be felt not only in Greece but throughout the eurozone. Buoyed by the backing of their people which they say strengthens their bargaining position, the Greek government is upbeat about filing a new bailout deal. TRANSLATION: We will try to cooperate with our partners and will invite them to find common ground and we will try to be positive. TRANSLATION: Greece will go back to the negotiation table is and our primary responsibility is to reinstate the financial situation of the country. Or Greeks celebrating the no vote dancing on the edge of a precipice? Greece has to wait for the reaction of its eurozone partners. It could just have taken a big step closer to falling out of the single currency. So, what will be the response of the other Eurozone countries to Greece’s rejection of their latest bailout deal? German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the French President Francois Hollande will meet in Paris tomorrow, and they’ve called for an emergency summit of all the Eurozone leaders, expected on Tuesday. Our Economics Editor Robert Peston is in Athens, but first let’s talk How close his Greece to leaving the euro? The Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said he doesn’t want take rupture with Europe but he may not be able to avoid a rupture with the euro. I learned today that Greek banks are just days away from running out of cash, that is days away from collapse, or what Alexis suppress said was a humanitarian disaster. It would mean Greeks losing huge chunks of their saving. It would make it almost impossible for Greece to import vital medicines and raw materials. It would be an economic disaster. What weak banks need our emergency loans. The European Central Bank cut off those loans a week ago and is showing no signs of providing those loans in the next 21+-1+8 hours, no matter how desperately the Greek government would like them to do that. Which leaves the Greek government with one of two choices. The ECB could ignore the European Central Bank and make emergency euro loans to those banks that would be seen by many eurozone government heads as they date factor withdrawal from the euro. There will be furious. Or the Greek government could to recreate the new drachma to P""ÂP UP could to recreate the new drachma to prop up its banks. That fear of a Greek euro exit is weighing on governments and central banks and investors. It will be an extraordinarily hairy date on the markets tomorrow. Lets talk to Gavin Hewitt in Berlin. What is the likely reaction of other euro seen leaders? This vote was an act of defiance against Europe’s leaders, many of whom had warned a no vote was a vote to leave the euro. There will be emergency meetings. Angela Merkel will leave tomorrow to meet with Francois land in Paris. He has spoken to Alexis Tsipras on the phone. There is huge pressure to revive talks but Angela Merkel is under pressure. Her deputy chancellor under pressure. Her deputy chancellor said Alexis Tsipras had effectively torn down the bridges on which compromise could be built and other voices are saying Greece should leave the eurozone. They feel there has been a total breakdown of trust with the Greek government. On Tuesday, there will be an emergency eurozone summit. At least one of the leaders sitting around the table believes Greece should leave the eurozone. Compromise in all this is going to be very difficult. We will return to Athens for more on what is expected towards the end of the programme. The Chancellor George Osborne has been outlining details of the government’s proposed ?12bn in welfare cuts, ahead of the budget on Wednesday. They include lowering the cap on the total amount of benefits some households receive. The Chancellor says his Budget will ""reward work over welfare"". Here’s our Political Correspondent Alex Forsyth. It’s the first all-Conservative Budget for more than 18 years and the Chancellor’s expected to reveal long-awaited details of £12 billion of welfare cuts. George Osborne, unfettered by Lib Dems in coalition, can press on with Tory principles and promises a fairer system for working people. It is not fair, for example, that people out of work can earn more than people in work, so we’re going to cut the benefit cap, as we said in our manifesto, to £23,000 in London but I can tell you today will be lower in the rest of the country. It’s thought the cap for places outside London, like here in Manchester, will be £20,000 per household. For some, it could mean a cut in benefits of up to £6,000 a year. If they cut the benefits than maybe I might have to move, then I’ll be in a high-rise block with loads of whatever. No matter what they do it’s all going to hit the working class and that’s it. I think it’s reasonable, you know, I mean £20,000 is quite a lot of money. The Chancellor has hinted at other areas that could be cut to find the 12 billion of savings. He said tax credits, used to top up earnings for the low-paid, are very expensive. He said the housing benefit bill needs to be looked at, and it’s thought he wants the BBC to pay for the cost of free TV licences for the over 75s, which could be up to £650 million. Experts say such measures could have significant impact, particularly as the Chancellor’s ruled out some savings such as cuts for pensioners. Given what the Chancellor said he wants to protect, £12 billion is a pretty large proportion of the rest of the social security budget, a good 10%. To get there you need to make some really significant cuts to some of the big benefits - housing benefits and tax credits. That affects people on low incomes. Labour has questioned the government’s priorities and warned the most vulnerable must be protected. The Chancellor claims he’s putting work over welfare in the first Budget which will wholly reflect his vision for the country. Well as you heard there, the chancellor is planning to announce in Wednesday’s Budget that the BBC will have to meet the cost of free TV licences for over-75s. A former Chairman of the BBC Board of Governors, Sir Christopher Bland, described the move as ""the worst form of dodgy Whitehall accounting"". Our correspondent Nick Higham is outside New Broadcasting House. Potentially, how much cost the BBC? A lot of money. Chancellor says the BBC should make savings because it’s part the public sector and this is an attractive idea because it takes a lot of money out of the welfare budget. We are talking about £650 million, about one fifth of the BBC’s total budget. When this was suggested in 2010, the BBC’s trustees threatened to resign. One told me today this could mean the closure of BBC Three, BBC Four, digital radio, local radio, parts of the World Service. The BBC won’t make any comment. Sir Christopher but that said it’s fine if the government wants to give free licenses to over 75, but it’s the government who should pay for it. The Chancellor may give the BBC a sweetener. You don’t need to pay the licence fee if you only watch catch-up TV. The Chancellor may be prepared to change the law so those people are forced to pay the licence fee. It won’t make up the shortfall, but it will be a sign the government is committed to the BBC as technology changes. Princess Charlotte has been christened at a ceremony on the Sandringham estate. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge chose five godparents including William’s cousin Laura Fellowes. It was the family’s first public outing together, since Charlotte’s birth in May.

Children in Gaza are still showing signs of severe emotional distress, a year on from the war with Israel. The charity Save the Children says at least 500 were among the more than Our Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet has been speaking to some of the youngsters most affected, including one 12-year-old boy, who survived a defining moment of the war. A year ago life changed forever for 12-year-old Syed. The last time they went to the beach to play became one of the most harrowing moments of the war. Israel says its air force mistook the children for Hamas fighters. Syed’s brother Mohammed and three cousins were buried that day. In all, more than 500 children were killed in last year’s conflict. Many children also lost loved ones, lost their homes. Syed still lives in his family’s small flat, not far from the beach. But his mother says he’s not the same boy. Syed dropped out of school. It reminds him of his brother. His father takes him out on his fishing boat, but Syed no longer feels safe here. Syed is one of some 1+00,000 Gazan children the UN says need counselling. He and three cousins who survived the beach attack are all deeply scarred. One tried to kill himself. Another almost killed someone else. Say goodbye to these strong men, they sing, of the four boys who died that day on the beach. They ask, who says that scars heal and pain gets any easier? And you can hear more about the children affected by the war, on both sides of the conflict in ""Children of the Gaza War"" on BBC2 on Wednesday at 9:00pm.

It may have been a very familiar result with a Mercedes one-two, but the race was far from predictable. Patrick Gearey reports from Silverstone. Thanks to his car, his skill, his tyres, Lewis Hamilton is a triple British Grand Prix winner. This is a race he has embraced, fuelled by the energy generated by a record crowd of 11+0,000 people. Hamilton had begun on pole. This would be no procession though. The start was hardly predictable. Williams getting both cars passed both Mercedes. In a blur, Hamilton’s lead was gone.

That’s all your sport. Services will be held on Tuesday to mark the 10 year anniversary of the 7/7 terror attacks in London. 52 people were killed and more than 700 were injured. In recent days we’ve been hearing from some of those caught up in the tragedy. Dr Peter Holden was working at the Headquarters of the British Medical Association, just across the street from the explosion on a number 30 bus. This is his story. When the bomb went off I was slightly sensitised to the fact that something was going on, because of the helicopter and all the klaxons and anything else, but I remember everything went momentarily salmon pink and in retrospect that must have been the pressure wave hitting us and slightly distorting my eyeballs. And then I heard the bang. SIRENS. I managed to get the window open and looked straight out. And the bus was there. The roof was off it, there was a taxi there, there was debris everywhere. And you could see victims. I could see colleagues down in the street and table tops, rather like that one there, being used as stretchers. Ijust turned to my three colleagues and said, ""This is a bus bomb."" As I was walking to the main gates I thought how quiet everything is. There were no seagulls, no aircraft, no traffic. It was absolutely quiet. And that really was quite eerie. I thought, either I can let emotion take over or let training kick in, and I opted for the latter and let training kick in. In fact, the first half an hour was really quite hard because we’d got no kit. We’d got one pair of latex gloves, one pocket facemask, one identity card and four statutory first aid kits. And in fact we were cutting up the curtains from the state room into bandages. My team, as I choose to call them, delivered what the medical profession is about, without fear or favour. We didn’t know whether we were dealing with victims, the perpetrators of the crime or what. ",,

We’re in Hyde Park this evening, by the memorial to the victims of the London bombings. 52 steel columns to mark each of those who were killed exactly ten years ago today. A ceremony of remembrance took place here this afternoon to remember them, the injured, the bereaved and others caught up in the chaos and tragedy of that morning. There have been other ceremonies across the capital, and a minute’s silence to remember the worst single terror attack on British soil. 52 people murdered and more than 700 injured by four suicide bombers. Our special correspondent Fergal Keane has been following the day’s events, ten years on. This was the London the bombers wanted to destroy. An idea as much as a metropolis. The echoes of a fateful morning were everywhere today. Ladies and gents, we need to clear Russell Square. It was probably one of the worst noises I have ever heard in my life. Your gut drops when you hear it, it was the loudest boom ever. wounded, and the fateful numerals 7/7 engraved in the memory of a Day when we recall the incredible resolve and resolution of Londoners in the United Kingdom, a day when we remember the threat that we still face, but above all it is a day when we think of the grace and dignity of the victims’ we think of the grace and dignity of the victims’ families. The solemn process of remembering began this morning. The laying of flowers at the The bombers claimed to be acting in the name of Islam. They killed people of all backgrounds. Today is all about showing solidarity, to the families of the victims and the survives and I as a Muslim, imam, wanted to be part of that service. At St Paul’s Cathedral symbol of a city that defied the Nazi blitz ordinary Londoners came to reject the ideology of killing and to show respect They are not going to win. That is all there is to it. I am here just to support and to be here for all the people who have lost their lives. Inside, representatives of the emergency services on duty that day, carried candles marked with the name of each site that was attacked. Bus driver George Psaradakis was driving the number 30 bus blown up on Tavistock Square. There was solidarity. London had been attacked. And our unity was in our grieving. Then, silence. A minute to reflect on the dead, and all that has been borne by those who survived. Back at Hyde Park the laying of flowers for the families of the dead and survives led by the Duke of Cambridge. Emma Craig was is-year-old when she survived the attack at Aldgate My mum rang me to check I was OK. Because she had heard a bomb had gone off. He attack at Aldgate My mum rang me to check I was OK. Because she had heard a bomb had gone off. I said ""Mum, I was there. I was on the tube."" My mum doesn’t square swear, so all use she had heard a bomb had gone off. I said ""Mum, I was there. I was on the tube."" My mum doesn’t square swear, so all I remember her saying was ""Sugar, I’m on my way."". Cities can rebuild. Tragedy becomes part of their legend. But in private live, the journey is far harder. All of those who were killed in the attack left behind families suddenly bereaved. Many of those families have been attending today’s memorials. Some took time to reflect on their loss with our Special Correspondent Lucy Manning. Miriam could be serious, and she could be incredibly daft and fun, always very positive whatever happened. Ciaran was a lovely man, a lovely boy, really. He enjoyed life. Happy-go-lucky. james was, I would say, highly intelligent, fun loving and had a good sense of humour. A bit impractical. Miriam Hyman loved to draw, to paint. People always noticed the 32-year-old’s smile. She was murdered on the bus in Tavistock Square. She had this immediacy, an incredible warmth, she was altruistic and generous. Football-mad Ciaran Cassidy was just 22 when he was murdered, on the Tube at King’s Cross. If I left the house with him to go to Finsbury Park, it would take half an hour, because every person he passed knew him and wanted to talk to him. james Mayes’ job was to try and improve the NHS. Six-foot tall, musical and a book lover, the 28-year-old was also killed at King’s Cross. Initially I felt that the colour had gone out of the world. It was kind of grey, and you couldn’t, well, I couldn’t see that it was ever going to be different, and it really did seem that life was going to be just awfully long and awfully grey forever. Their memories are now a decade old. She really loved to squeeze every last drop out of life, and the Saturday before the bombings, she and I went to an outdoor Elvis Costello concert together and we were dancing there, and after we got home she was dancing, and our last dance was to Stevie Wonder’s Superstition. How do you feel, a decade later, about what happened to Ciaran? A lot poorer. A lot, lot poorer. Half our family has gone, really. I only have a daughter left, so it’s... I think it has made our family incomplete, in some ways, and you can’t really replace one member of four in that kind of way, I don’t think, so I think there’s always going to be a gap. I knew Miriam a little bit, through friends, and I’ll always remember her with a big smile on her face. She always seemed to be such a positive person. Having had Mim’s identity confirmed to us the previous day, this is the first time I’m sitting with my parents in the garden, and we’re remembering Mim with laughter. And we were surprised at ourselves and we were almost embarrassed in case people would hear us and think, what are they doing? Right from the start we’ve remembered her the way she lived. I mean, if someone died naturally, you can accept it, but when someone is brutally killed and murdered, it’s completely different. A different ball game, I mean, it was just senseless killing. 52 innocent people killed for nothing. She was my little sister. I’m the luckiest person in the world because she was my little sister for 32 years. We were blessed in those years we had, actually, and I’ve always felt that. That, you know, at least we had him for some time. Ijust wish we could have had him for a bit longer, really. Lives, futures, dreams, all lost on the 7th ofjuly. One of those people caught up in the bombings was Paul Dadge. Not as a survivor or member of the emergency services, but a passer by, who rushed to help those in need. He was caught on camera helping badly burnt Davinia Douglass, and that photo become one of the defining images of the day. I’m please to say Paul Dadge is here with me. Thank you for taking the time to talk to usment you were passing by and you decided to set up an informal triage centre. Yes, the people who were coming out of the tube station were starting to congregate on the corner of the road and to me it was common-sense for these people, they were ushered into an area where they could be kept together until more police arrived to take details from people. We were evacuated from that Marks & Spencer’s store, dav that was closest to me, I grabbed it and ran out into the street. We were directed to a hoe ho the road, unbeknown to me there was a line of photographers and we ran directly to that line and we were obviously photographed. That became one of the defining images of the day. One thing that struck me at the service and you were there of course, was in amid the obvious sorrow, so many of the people present, was a sense of determination and a bond between you, forged by the events of this day. We have known each now for ten years. I think we have got, we are like an extended family, across all of the sites, so, notjust Edgware Road where I was. We are supportive of each other, protective of each other as well. And that is a bond that has formed over the last ten year, we have been on a journey together, and we are very much in sympathy at the moment with people who have been involved in the incidents in Tunisia who are about to start on thatjourney, we will do what we can to support them. Thank you for talking to us today. Behind me you can see the flower and bouquets and personal messages left here today at this memorial to the 52 people who lost their lives ten years ago today. You can see the yellow flowers left there signifying innocence and purity. From Hyde Park, back to you in the studio. Sophie. Leaders from across Europe have arrived in Brussels for tonight’s emergency summit to try to resolve the Greek debt crisis. The German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Greece must commit to reforms to secure new loans, and she stressed that there were just days left to reach a deal. If no deal is reached, the banking system in Greece faces collapse. From Brussels, here’s our Europe correspondent Damian Grammaticas. He is the man who is shaking Europe’s foundations. Alexis Tsipras, smiling, even as his country teeters on the brink. His referendum win means, he says, the will of 11 million Greeks is to end austerity. Yet to be convinced, the leaders of the rest of the Eurozone. The Netherlands, France, representing 300 citizens who share ti’Iâ SBITIE CUI’I’âI’ICy. Chief among them, Germany. There are, she said, no grounds yet for new negotiations with Greece, adding Europe should be prepared to help, but Greece must in return be prepared to carry out reforms. the European Union has ever faced. Greece’s debts now stand at a staggering £230 billion. That is about 180% of what Greece’s economy produces each year, almost double the size. And money has been withdrawn fast from Greek bank accounts. Deposits are at their lowest level in a decade. Of course many EU countries have made painful economic reforms Of since the crisis. They don’t see why Greeks should be given special treatment. EU finance ministers today arrived to hear what EU finance ministers today arrived to hear what Greece is now proposing. I’m sorry to say we have made no progress towards a deal today as we didn’t get any concrete proposals from the Greek side. Time is of the essence here, and unfortunately we could not make any progress because there is nothing on the table. They are promising for tomorrow, for the Greek government it is âVâIây tiITIâ I’|'I8I’I8I’I8. For us always can’t be manana every day. Europe’s leaders now expect Greece to table something tomorrow. By the end of the week its banks could be bust, Europe deep in economic and political mire. Nothing, of course, the Greeks came empty-handed. In Greece, the banks are still closed, with people only allowed to withdraw around EAO a day. And there are signs that the banks are fast running out of cash. So how are people coping with the uncertainty? Mark Lowen has spent the day with the residents of one Athens suburb. It is the life and soul of a Greek neighbourhood where locals spend what little money there is on what they cherish. Today the market is in this Athens suburb. It may seem bustling, but these are the worst of times. She says she took a month’s worth of cash out of the bank a few days before it closed, so worried was she. There is no money, there is no democracy, there is no hope. Here, like everywhere in this country, life has slowed down as Greece’s financial future hangs in the balance. Across Greece the mood has changed over the past few years from anger to depression to now overwhelming uncertainty, over the banks and over Greece’s place in the Euro. People here simply don’t know what they’ll wake up to tomorrow and that is what’s so paralysing. Across the road, the pharmacy, too, is feeling the effect. With Greek banks on life support, customers are anxious. The financial crisis is becoming a health one. Customers would panic, they did not have the money they needed to buy the medicines. And we had problems to buy these medicines from our suppliers as we had a greater need. So have you had a shortage of medicine? Shortage of medicine in some medicines that were in shortage before, and now the shortage was greater. Next door they pay the price with empty tables. Staff have been cut, and the butcher has sent a note that with banks shut, the price of meat will go up 10%. After Ao years, Nikos says he may have to close. One neighbourhood that tells the story of Greece, a once confident country that’s fallen so far, so fast. Our top story this evening. Britain remembers. Ten years after the London bombings which killed 52 people and injured many more. And still to come. England expects, but holds its breath over taking Murray ensures at least one brother will be in Wimbledon semifinal action. Should shops be allowed to open for longer on Sundays? The government thinks they should and it’s about to unveil new proposals for England and Wales to allow that to happen. Current laws allow smaller shops to open all day, but large stores, can only open their doors for a maximum of six hours. In his budget tomorrow, the Chancellor will give elected mayors and councils powers to decide what’s right for their area. Our correspondent jon Kay has been gauging reaction in Bristol. Here is what George Osborne is thinking. He says if you can go to your little corner shop on a Sunday night and buy a pint of milk, if you can go on the Internet on a Sunday night and buy clothes or electrical devices, why shouldn’t you be able to go to your big supermarket and do your big supermarket shop on a Sunday night, or your big DIY store, out-of-town retail centre? There was a pilot scheme in London during the Olympics, the Treasury thinks it can boost the economy and jobs. What about out of London in the rest of the UK? Shoppers here in Bristol seem split right down the middle. I think it’s about time, because most people work during the week. So on a Sunday they need to go and shop. Would you shop on a Sunday afternoon, Sunday night? Yeah, probably. It is like any other day then, isn’t it. There has to be something a bit special about Sunday, about being a family day, about being a religious day, it’s Sunday. I work in a shop on a Sunday, and by 3.00, no-one comes in, so I am not sure if you would get very many customers. I am in there enough. People are shopping long enough now any way. You don’t fancy it, Sunday night? No, I don’t. He certainly seems very determined and certain about that. It won’t be UP and certain about that. It won’t be up to George Osborne to decide, he will devolve upon our two councils in England and Wales. The elected mayor in Bristol says he thinks it would be a difficult decision, because he does not want the Megastores, as he calls them, to damage little shops like bees. He wants to damage little shops like bees. He wa nts to protect wants to protect shop workers rights. And he says he wants to protect the special nature of Sunday. Decisions for local authorities to make. Remember, in Scotland, there are no restrictions on Sunday training. In Northern Ireland larger shops are limited to five hours. An investigation into the UK energy market has found that millions of people have been paying too much for their electricity and gas, partly because switching suppliers was too hard. The Competition and Markets Authority said bills were, on average, 5% too high, meaning customers had been overcharged by more than £1 billion between 2009 and 2013. Our industry correspondent john Moylan reports. It’s been suspected for years, now it’s been confirmed. The big energy suppliers have market power. They can exploit that position and charge higher prices. In short, millions of us has been praying too much for our energy. -- us has been praying too much for our energy. -- have been paying. That’s the damning verdict from these experts. Forthe past the damning verdict from these experts. For the past year they’ve been cast in their eye over the entire energy market. The team have undertaken almost a dozen site visits. There have been dozens of hearings and almost a hundred submissions. It’s the biggest investigation into our energy market since its privatisation. Their landmark report says customers have been overcharged due to lack of competition, that’s up to £60 per household. So it’s proposing a regulated tariff, a price cap to protect customers while reforms pushed through. It must be right for the regulator to step in quickly and protect people, particularly vulnerable customers from excessive prices. Talking today about saving money on energy bills. The report says that switching supplier can save jewel fuel customers are around £160 per year. But for many people like these women on low incomes in Cambridge it’s still a daunting process. No, Ido trust them. But I feel that I have no choice. So I stayed put. If we knew about it more and understood it more, that would be more helpful. The probe found no evidence of illegal behaviour by the big six firms. It doesn’t recommend breaking them up. At the prospect of putting millions of customers on a regulated tariff will be a concern. It’s a really complex issue, just looking at how you might set it, administer it. It needs a period of reflection for all stakeholders to look at. The government says it would consider a temporary price cap for some customers. As for the CMA, it’s shone fresh light on the energy market and has the power to really shakeit market and has the power to really shake it up. It will publish its final decisions by the end of the year. A brief look at some of the day’s other other news stories. A former city trader, Tom Hayes, who is accused of manipulating inter-bank lending rates, has told a court that senior managers knew what he was doing. He is the first person to face a criminal trial in connection to the Libor scandal. Mr Hayes denies eight counts of conspiracy to defraud. A migrant trying to reach the UK has died on a freight shuttle inside the Channel Tunnel. An official said he may have been hit by the train while trying to board it. A group of Ao migrants were taken from the tunnel after the victim was found. The England and Australia cricket teams resume their rivalry in Cardiff tomorrow when the first of five Ashes Test matches begins. Last time out Australia overwhelmed England on their home soil in a one-sided and frequently bad-tempered series. Now England are hoping home advantage can help, in Wales. joe Wilson reports. Australia know exactly where they are, and this is not home, where they humbled England in the last Ashes. This is unpredictable Britain, where the weather changes by the second, forcing training session indecision. Australia haven’t won an Ashes Series here for 14 years, and Michael Clarke has been part of all the recent failures. He’s desperate to win, but insists he will be nice. I’ve made it very clear that in the last series, if somebody overstepped the mark, it was me, and as captain of this team I need to be more disciplined, and I know I will be. After a decade of live cricket solely on subscription TV, England are trying to reach audiences in other ways. Through this film, passionately produced for social media, for example. So, the Ashes, it is all a question of rival identity. Which side are you on? Aussie or Pom? Actually, it’s not quite that simple. In old south Wales, a man from New South Wales, coaching the England team. Trevor Bayliss. His first match in charge is against his native Australia. If you are very good at yourjob, and England win a couple of Test matches, is there a danger there might be some kind of backlash back home, Trevor? CHUCKLING. What’s that man Bayliss doing, going against our guys? It’s funny, after I got the position, everyone I spoke to was very good about it, congratulating, and wishing me all the best, except against Australia. I’m working for England at the moment, and that’s the team I’m coaching, so I want England to win. That’s just the way it is. In truth, the two captains, and two teams, know each other inside out. It’sjust possible this summer familiarity will breed respect. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s john Hammond ~ I want to show you some storms, things got lively this afternoon with heavy downpours, thunder and lightning drifting across northern England. Laterthis lightning drifting across northern England. Later this afternoon for Northern Ireland and particularly eastern Scotland, torrential downpours and some flooding. This shot was taken earlier from the heart of Aberdeen. Surface water around and storms rumbling on into the evening for Scotland. Batch of showery rain pushing down across northern and western parts of England and Wales towards the south-east. A lot of cloud, Breeze, temperatures not falling all that low, but it will not feel all that friendly tomorrow morning, quite cool in the breeze. Showers dotted around, they will drift south-eastwards. The main focus of the showers by the afternoon across more eastern parts of the UK, which means, I’m quite optimistic for the Ashes, that we’ll get away with a largely dry day. Where some layers, it will be cool in the breeze, particularly where it stays cloudy. Brighter spells but not doing much for the temperatures. Still some sharp showers to be had across some eastern parts of England. The odd one across the heart of Scotland. Hopefully not torrential downpours like we have seen today. Some brightness butjust 12 or like we have seen today. Some brightness but just 12 or 13 degrees. I know it’sjuly but we are in for a bit of a plunge of cold air coming down from the Arctic in the middle part of this week. It will not get desperately low but compared with last week you will notice the difference, particularly overnight with difference, particularly overnight with some pretty chilly nights, particularly across the more northern parts of the UK, temperatures could get down to low single figures. It. To warm up again as we end the week. Best of the Sunshine South. A reminder of our main story. Britain remembers, ten years after the London bombings which killed 52 people and killed hundreds more. Tonight on BBC London: A special programme to mark the tenth anniversary of the 7-7 bombings. On this day ten years ago 52 people were killed in four suicide bombings here in the capital. Nearly 800 more were injured in the attacks on three tube trains and a bus. It was the worst single terrorist atrocity on British soil. Hello, it is the underground. Hello, can you please get as many ambulances as you can? There’s been an explosion. A huge light appeared. We were trying to close the doors, there was smoke, you couldn’t breed. There had been a series of explosions on the public transport system in London, which police fear could have been a coordinated attack. People started to scream. There was a burning smell. Everyone thought they were going to die. Everything was dusty and we could not break the windows of the carriage. People were screaming for help. They struck at some of the most reassuring symbols of everyday life, a bus and the tube. There was a lot of smoke and bodies and the roof had been torn off of the bus. Everyone started screaming and we got out as quickly as we could. My sister called to tell us what happened and she was hurt and she is on the tube somewhere and we just want to know that she is safe. Londoners will not be divided by this cowardly attack. They will stand together in solidarity around those who have been injured, those who have been bereaved, and that is why I am proud to be the Mayor of that city. Today, survivors and relatives of those killed have beenjoined by tens of thousands of people across the Capital to remember - events large and small, public and private. Londoners came together to pay their respects, as Katharine Carpenter reports. As the clock crept towards the time the bombs went off, survivors and those who had left loved ones gathered at the places were their lives changed. Londoners, long defined in the face of terror, bustled past, getting on with their lives, but remembering also. It is strange to see the normality of people going about their everyday lives and also having the sombre memories of that day as well. People still carry on as usual. We are joining hands together to fight terrorism. Whenever you come to London now, you think about security. Today, even more so. But for others, today was about very specific memories. Sights, sounds, that will never leave them. There were movements and they were happening so quickly and I couldn’t tell howl happening so quickly and I couldn’t tell how I was doing them, whether I was being faster not, or in slow motion. So really if you ask me how long I was there, where’d you get four seconds, were you there ",,

At St Paul’s Cathedral, lighted candles from the four bomb locations at a service of remembrance for the 52 who lost their lives. The bombers struck in the morning rush hour, hitting a bus and three Tube train. Ten years on, the city paid a silent tribute. And among those paying tribute today were some of the survivors. Not for my sake, but for those that were killed on that day and their families. They’re the people we’re here today to remember. May we never forget. We’ll be reporting on the day’s services and we’ll be asking how the terror threat has changed in the past ten years. Also tonight: On the eve of the first Conservative Budget for nearly 20 years, we reveal a revised timetable of welfare cuts. The Greek Prime Minister is accused of failing to come up with new proposals to resolve his country’s debt crisis. He has been given until Thursday to come up with new proposals.

And looking ahead to the first Ashes Test and why the England On BBC London, a day of reflection across the capital as Londoners mark the tenth anniversary of 7/7. And, after a breakdown in talks, the biggest Tube strike for over a decade starts during tomorrow evening’s rush hour. Good evening. Ceremonies have taken place throughout the day to remember the 52 people killed and the hundreds injured ten years ago in the London bombings. Much of the city fell silent for a minute this morning and at St Paul’s Cathedral and in Hyde Park services of remembrance were attended by survivors, bereaved families, and those who contributed to the support and rescue work on the day. The Bishop of London said the bombings had released an ocean of pain that was still being felt by many, as Fergal Keane reports. This was the London the bombers wanted to destroy. An idea, as much as a metropolis. The echoes of a fateful morning were everywhere today. SIRENS Ladies and gents, we need to clear now Russell Square. It’s probably one of the worst noises I’ve ever heard in my life. Your gut drops when you hear it. It was the loudest boom ever. Everybody started screaming and we got out as quickly as we could. 52 lives taken, 700 wounded and the fateful numerals 7/7 engraved in the memory of the city. It’s a day when we recall the incredible resolve and resolution of Londoners and the United Kingdom. A day when we remember the threat that we still face, but, above all, a day when we think of the grace and the dignity of the victims’ families. The solemn process of remembering began this morning, with the laying of flowers to the dead at Hyde Park. The bombers claimed to be acting in the name of Islam. They killed people of all backgrounds. At St Paul’s Cathedral, symbol of a city that defied the Nazi blitz, ordinary Londoners came to show respect and to reject the ideology of killing. Representatives of the emergency services carried candles marked with the names of each place that was attacked. George Psaradakis was driving the number 30 bus blown up on Tavistock Square. Giles Vernon Hart. Marie joanne Hartley. Miriam Hyman. Ojara Ikeagwu. Shahara Islam. Neetu jain. Laura Susan Webb. William Wise. Then, silence. A minute to reflect on the dead, and all that has been borne by those who survived. Ordinary Londoners showed again their desire for community. Was your sense of longing here damaged at all by 7/7? Not at all, I think it is binding me more with this city and this country. Back at Hyde Park, the laying of flowers for the families of the dead and survivors led by the Duke of Cambridge. Emma Craig was 1lI-years-old when she survived the attack at Aldgate. She had honest and painful words. My mum rang me to check I was OK, because she had heard a bomb had gone off. I said ""Mum, I was there. I was on the tube."" My mum doesn’t swear, so all I remember her saying was ""Sugar, I’m on my way."" Quite often people say, it wouldn’t break us. Terrorism won’t break us. The fact is, it may not have broken London, but it did break some of us. Sometimes I feel that people are so hell-bent about making a point about terrorism not breaking is that they forget about all of the people that got caught up in it. Not for my sake, but for those killed on that day and their families, they are the people we are here today to remember. May we neverforget. Cities can rebuild. Tragedy becomes part of their legend. But in private lives, the journey is far harder. The victims of the 7/7 bombings, many of them young people, came from all over the United Kingdom and from many parts of the world. Their friends and relatives were in London today, attending the services and ceremonies, and some have spoken to our special correspondent Lucy Manning. Miriam could be serious, and she could be incredibly daft and fun, always very positive whatever happened. Ciaran was a lovely man, a lovely boy, really. He enjoyed life.

That, you know, at least we had him for some time. Ijust wish we could have had him for a bit longer, really. Lives, futures, dreams, all lost on the 7th ofjuly. Some of the relatives speaking to Lucy Manning. The police and the security services believe the threat posed by Islamists in Britain today is higher than it was a decade ago. Let’s talk to our security correspondent Frank Gardner, who’s in Tavistock Square, the site of one of the explosions in 2005. Frank, why don’t you describe to us how you see the threat today, in relation to a decade ago? I think it is far harder to pin down. The site of the bus bomb attack, part of a day, synchronised, coordinated attack, was really typical of Al-Qaeda attack planning in the first ten years of this century. The 911 attacks, the Madrid bombings, they were all coordinated a very high-profile attacks. The ambition to do those kind of attacks by some people hasn’t gone away, but it is far harder for the police, people hasn’t gone away, but it is far harderfor the police, sorry, far easier for the far harderfor the police, sorry, far easierfor the police far easier for the police and intelligence services to detect them these days. The big new threat they are facing is that of people that are self starters, people radicalised over the internet, very much by what is going on in Syria, encouraged by fighters out there, by recruiters, you don’t even need to come out to Syria, they say, go and do what you have to new. The difference that the police and intelligence services, that they are having to skim through, is the difference between aspiration, people that want to do something, and operation, the real threat that they have to stop very early on in the attack planning. The Chancellor, George Osborne, is preparing to deliver the first Conservative budget for nearly 20 years. His statement to MPs tomorrow will include details of welfare and other spending cuts as Mr Osborne tries to move to turn the deficit into a budget surplus by the end of this Parliament. There’s already a pledge to cut a further £12 billion from the welfare budget and the focus is likely to be on restricting tax credits and housing benefit, but there’s news, too, on other measures, including taking more households out of inheritance tax, paid for by reducing tax breaks on the pension contributions of higher earners. The Chancellor might also allow shops in England and Wales to open for longer on Sundays. And tax thresholds, especially for the less well off, could be raised again in line with a manifesto commitment. Our political editor Nick Robinson is in Downing Street. What are you expecting tomorrow? We are expecting the detail of those £12 billion worth of welfare cuts which the Tories refused to give in the general election campaign. But I’m expecting something else which is more of a surprise, that those cuts will be phased in over a slower timetable than we were told. Not over two years, but over three. 8 billion over the first two years, another four in the third year. I am told that that will not reduce the controversy that the cuts generate, not to silence what the Chancellor has called the predictable howls of protest. Because when he does limit child tax credit, I am told to families with only two children, you will not be able to claim for more about at least if you are not a new claimant, when he cuts Housing benefit from young people, when he removes part of what is now called empowerment support allowance but used because sickness benefit, the bit that pays for people who are deemed to be capable of work, those will indeed reduce those howls of protest. He can do a bit slower because there is a bit more tax money coming in, and that will allow him to make tax cuts as well, not just for the low paid, but increasing that threshold at which you increasing that threshold at which YÂU PGY you pay a higher rate 1+op tax. The question is whether he will, as many economists have urged him to do, slowed the planned pace of spending cuts overall. The OECD said to front-load the cuts would endanger the speed of recovery and punish the poor. I asked a well-placed person who knows about the Budget to sum it UP who knows about the Budget to sum it up for me. The reply came very simply. Big, very big. It has got to be, given the scale of what the Chancellor has got to do. But exactly what you put after the word big will depend on your political persuasion. The latest efforts to find a solution to the Greek debt crisis have still not produced a result after Greek ministers were accused of failing to come up with any new proposals. Eurozone leaders had expected to consider new plans at an emergency summit in Brussels this evening. But now the Greek Prime Minister has been given until Thursday to provide a new plan. Damian Grammaticas reports. His country is teetering on the brink, but smiling today, Greece’s Prime Minister. Alexis Tsipras came to tell Europe’s leaders they cannot ignore his referendum win, a democratic mandate from 11 million Greeks who want to stay in the euro, but end austerity. But the rest of the Eurozone, prime ministers and presidents from 18 nations, representing 300 million citizens who share the same currency, aren’t willing to rewrite the rules for him or forgive Greece’s debts. Chief among them, Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel. There are, she said, no grounds yet for new negotiations with Greece, adding that Europe should be prepared to help, but Greece must in return be prepared to carry out reforms. The leaders here today are grappling with one of the biggest challenges the European Union has ever faced. Greece’s debts now stand at a staggering £230 billion. That is about 180% of what Greece’s economy produces each year, almost double the size. And money is being withdrawn fast from Greek bank accounts. Deposits are at their lowest level in a decade. Of course, many EU countries have made painful economic reforms since the crisis. They don’t see why Greece should be given special treatment. EU finance ministers were hoping to hear what Greece is now proposing after it rejected their reforms in its referendum. But Greece’s new finance minister came clutching not a plan, just some notes hastily scribbled on a hotel pad, one to remind him self to avoid triumphalism. And around the table tonight, European leaders. In their hands, the future of their single currency and Greece’s place in it. They have agreed that Athens will now present a new plan The decision is that we wait until Sunday for the new proposal to the European institution by the Greek government. I hope this could be the last meeting about Greece. the end of the war. I hope it will be a happy ending. Greece has been told it must do more if it wants negotiations to begin. It has been given two days to come up with its proposal. Damian Grammaticas, BBC News, Brussels. In a moment, we’ll have a word with Robert Peston, our economic editor, but first to Brussels and our Europe editor, Katya Adler. Is there a clear way ahead now or not? Yes and no. There is talk tonight that there is a short-term deal on the table. The idea would be to keep Greece afloat long enough to be able to then have a longer term deal. This is dismissed by many as typical EU kicking the count down the road. It has been another day of mixed messages in Greece, and if the noises coming from Eurozone leaders sound confused, that is because they are confused, frustrated and dismayed. There has never been a situation like this. No Eurozone country has ever acted with such defiance towards its creditors. No Eurozone country has ever come this close to falling out of the single currency. It was thought to be so unthinkable that there are no provisions in the euro for a country to leave it. So we have heard this phrase a lot of late, uncharted territory. If Greece nosedives, so could the rest of the Eurozone, affecting every economy of every member state. That is another adjective to describe the feelings of Eurozone leaders, which is worried, as they ponder whether to give Greece more money. The unity in the European Union is also at stake. Greece is clearly isolated among some countries, and you have big powers, France, Germany and Italy at odds over how to proceed and how tough to be with Greece. It is of such concern that all 28 EU leaders have decided to come to Brussels on Sunday to discuss what to do next. And Robert Peston, our economics editor, is here. What is your reading of what has happened today? In the last few minutes, we have had a press conference held by President of the European Union, and jean-Claude juncker, the commission president, which I found profoundly shocking and I am not often shocked. The president of the European Union said that at last, this is a real deadline for deciding whether Greece stays in the euro or goes from the euro. They want concrete proposals by the end of the week and the heads of government of the Eurozone and the wider European Union will make the definitive decision on Sunday. They have provisions in place to facilitate an exit of Greece from the euro. They have that plan B. They don’t wish to go to plan B, but right now, they do not have, Donald Tusk said, realistic proposals from Greece to stay in the euro. He said that what is at stake for the Greek people, in his words, the insolvency of its banking system and the property of Greece. So although we have had many deadlines, I am persuaded that this is a real deadline. And again, as Donald Tusk said, he regards this as the biggest moment in the history, he said, not only of the Eurozone, but of the wider EU. Thank you, Robert Peston and Katya Adler. An investigation into the energy market has found that millions of British customers have been paying too much for their electricity and gas, partly because switching suppliers has been too difficult. The Competition and Markets Authority said bills were on average 5% too high. It means that customers had in effect been overcharged by more than a billion pounds between 2009 and 2013, as our industry correspondent john Moylan reports. It has been suspected for years, and now it has been confirmed. The big energy suppliers have market power. They can exploit that position and charge higher prices. In short, millions of us have been paying too much for our energy. That is the damning verdict from these experts. For the past year, they had been casting their eye over the entire energy market. They have undertaken a dozen site visits and there have been almost 100 submissions. It is the most thorough investigation into our energy market since its privatisation. Their report says customers have been overcharged by £1.2 billion a year, due to lack of competition. That is up to £60 per household. It is proposing a regulated tariff, a price cap to protect customers whilst reforms are pushed through. It must be right for the regulator to step in quickly and protect vulnerable customers from excessive prices. The report says switching supplier can save dual-fuel customers around £160 a year, but for many people like these women on low incomes in Cambridge, it is still a daunting process. I do not trust them, but I feel I have no choice. If we knew about it more and understood it more, that would be more helpful. The probe found no evidence of illegal behaviour by the big six firms and does not recommend breaking them up, but the prospect of putting millions of customers on a regulated tariff will be a concern. You are looking at how you might set it and administer it, so it means a period of reflection with all stakeholders looking at it. The Government said it would consider a temporary price cut 'foI’ SOITIE CUSloITIâIâS. But the report has shown fresh light on the energy market and it has some power to shake it up and it will put forward its final decisions by the end of the year. A former City trader who is accused of manipulating inter-bank lending rates has told a court that senior managers knew what he was doing. Tom Hayes is the first person to face a criminal trial in connection to the Libor scandal. The former UBS and Citigroup trader denies eight counts of conspiracy to defraud over the period 2006 to 2010. The Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel says a migrant died on a freight shuttle trying to reach Britain. The incident happened near Calais early this morning and is the second migrant death in as many weeks. Eurotunnel has again called on governments to end the migrant crisis. At Wimbledon, Serena Williams came from a set down to beat Victoria Azarenka to reach the semi-finals. Miss Williams will hold all four major titles if she wins the championship. Cricket, and the first Ashes Test starts in Cardiff tomorrow. The England captain Alistair Cook says his side can overturn the odds and win back the urn. But Australia are overwhelming favourites to hold on following the whitewash of England just 18 months ago. joe Wilson’s report contains some flashing images. Australia know exactly where they are. This is not home, where they humbled England in the last Ashes, this is unpredictable Britain, where the weather changes by the second, forcing training session indecision. Australia haven’t won an Ashes series here for 14 years. Michael Clarke’s been part of all the recent failures. He’s desperate to win, but insists he will be nice. I’ve made it very clear that in the last series if somebody overstepped that mark, it was me. As captain of this team, I need to be more disciplined, and I will be. So, the Ashes. It’s all a question of rival identity. Which side are you on, Aussie or Pom? Actually, it’s not quite that simple. In old south Wales, a man from New South Wales, coaching the England team - Trevor Bayliss. His first match in charge is against his native Australia. If you are good at yourjob and England win a couple of Test matches, is there a danger that there might be some kind of backlash back home? ""What’s our man Bayliss doing, going against us?"" It was funny. After I got the position, everyone I spoke to was very good about it, congratulating and wishing me all the best, except against Australia. I’m working for England at the moment. That’s the team I’m coaching, so I want England to win. That’s just the way it is. In truth, the two captains and two teams know each other inside out. It’s just possible that this summer, familiarity will breed respect. joe Wilson, BBC News, Cardiff. Before we go, let’s pause to remember those who lost their lives in the London bombings ofjuly 7th 2005, the wide circles of families and friends they left behind and the hundreds of others whose lives were changed by injury on that morning a decade ago. Good night. BELLS TOLL. Miriam Hyman. Ojara Ikeagwu. Shahara Islam. The time is 11.30, and the one-minute silence will now begin. # I’ve looked at clouds from both sides now...# ..Not for my sake, but for those killed on that day and their families. They’re the people we’re here today to remember. May we never forget. # I really don’t know clouds at all. # Good evening. I’m Riz Lateef. Across the capital, 7/7 survivors and victims’ families have been joined by tens of thousands of people at events large and small, both public and private, to remember this day exactly ten years ago that changed London forever. As Katharine Carpenter reports, it was a day of unity, respect and reflection. As the clock crept towards the time the bombs went off, survivors and those who had lost loved ones gathered at the places were their lives changed. Londoners, long defiant in the face of terror, bustled past, getting on with their lives, but remembering too. Strange juxtaposition between the normality of people going about their everyday lives and also having the sombre memories of that day as well. People still carry on as usual. ",,

The Government announces the BBC will PGY Government announces the BBC will pay for TV licences for the over 75s. On the eve of the tenth anniversary of the London bombings, the unexpected friendships forged out of tragedy. Tonight on BBC London: I’ll be on the Olympic Park looking back ten years since the capital won the bid to host the games. Many promises were made, but did politicians ""squander"" the chance to get more young people into sport? in favour of action. A football injury means Rory Mcllroy misses this week’s Scottish Open and possibly the Open. The ball is in your court - that’s the message from Eurozone finance ministers to Greece after the country voted not to accept the current European bailout deal. The ministers are to hold emergency talks tomorrow but so far are not offering any fresh concessions. The German chancellor Angela Merkel has flown to Paris and is in a meeting with her French counterpart now. Emergency talks have taken place here too between the Prime minister and the Governor of the Bank of England. Meanwhile the banks in Greece will remain shut until at least Wednesday. Our economics editor Robert Peston reports from Athens. In the end it wasn’t close. A momentous victory for the no-campaign and Greece’s radical left-wing government. Not a no to Europe, they said, but a no to further austerity and recession. This morning the Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, met the leaders of all political parties, united for now to try to save the Greek economy. There is no time to lose and other European countries have sounded sceptical at best. One leading Greek minister told the BBC they should listen to Greek people. Their message is two fold, one that they fully support the government and B that they want a deal because the vast majority irrespective whether they vote yes or no, they want to stay in Europe. Another prominent figure in this Greek drama has resigned. Yanis Varoufakis said he’d been made aware that many of his fellow eurozone Finance Ministers would prefer him not to be in their meetings and the Prime Minister thought that could be helpful. Now the government’s needs to move on quickly. A changing of the guard and a gesture to European politicians who’ve reached the end of their tether with Greece. It’s a chance for the government here to portray this as a fresh start. But all the while and more immediately, what on earth is going to happen to the Greek banks? They’re still closed. People are still queueing and the money is about to run out. This is the biggest time pressure there is. If there is no sign of an agreement, which I hope will not be the case, then we’d have to extend the situation as it is so closed banks, closed Stock Exchange and Capitols. Greece waits and watches. He has been selling flowers on the street outside Parliament for 30 years. He’s seen crises come and go, but nothing quite like this. I saw quite a lot and today I feel very proud that I am Greek. That’s all. Pride I think is the word. Now the Government here is relying on Governments and institutions elsewhere in Europe to give it another chance, a deal involving less austerity and more debt relief and an agreement to keep the banks from collapse. It’s quite a gamble. So Eurozone leaders are now in uncharted waters , trying to resolve what has so far proved to be an intractable problem - how to keep Greece in the Eurozone without writing a blank cheque. Our Paris Correspondent Lucy Williamson is in Paris accessing the European Response, Lucy. The talks here are We need a strong, joined Europe. We can solve issues much better if Europe moves together. Greece’s debt totals 323 billion euros, around 30% is owed to the IMF, the European Central Bank and bondholders. But around 60% is owed to other Eurozone nations. Most to Germany, followed by France. On a personal level, French taxpayers are deeply divided over the Greek Prime Minister. But there is widespread support for his stand against Brussels and its austerity programme. At this restaurant, Parisians were out contributing to the coffers of one Greek business, as they wait to hear what their leaders decide. TRANSLATION: Europe needs to write off part of the Greek debt and renegotiate the terms because the Greeks need to live. They can’t be the ones to pay for their politicians’ errors. I’m really worried, I think Greece will have to leave the Eurozone. In the group there are rules everybody has to respect. Greece has shown people that there’s an alternative austerity. But what will it cost, and who will pay? So what does the Greek crisis mean for the UK? The chancellor George Osborne says the prospects of a happy resolution are diminishing and the risks for Britain are growing. Our Business Editor Kamal Ahmed assesses the UK response. In whatever language, Greece’s resounding no to Europe’s austerity plan was loud and clear. They were celebrating, but how far will the moment is events centred on Athens perfect Britain? Let start with the economy. Is the governor -- perfect Britain? Let start with the economy. Is the governor -- here is the governor of the Bank of England leaving a meeting this morning. He didn’t have much to say, leaving it to George Osborne to tell Parliament just how serious things were becoming. This is a critical moment in the economic crisis in Greece, nobody should be under any illusions. The situation risks going from bad to worse. Britain will be affected the longer the Greek crisis last and the worse it gets. There is no easy way out but even at the IIth hour we urge the Eurozone leaders and Greece to find a sustainable solution. As a member of the IMF, the UK is owed £8 billion by Greece. That’s considerably less than other members of the Eurozone. For example Aoooooooooo pounds is owed to Germany. As a trading partner Greece only represents 1.2% of the exports to the European Union, so the impact here of its economic problems is limited. At when it comes to holidays, there were 1.7 million visits to Greece in 2014. It’s one of the UK’s most popular destinations and there is some evidence that figure is higher this year. Tourism is big business and people jetting off to day were advised to take plenty of cash. At Stansted there were concerns. I went to the Euro change pace and changed all my money which is quite scary because I have to carry it with me. I’m not going to do anything stupid like get drunk and get mobbed. As holiday- makers like get drunk and get mobbed. As holiday-makers soaked up the sun, the travel industry was urging calm. In the resorts and hotels we are hearing it is very much business as usual. The hotels are running as normal, customers are able to take money out from the majority of ATMs, and supermarkets are well stocked. But what about markets? German and French stock exchanges were down. The value of the euro fell. But the volatility predicted by many did not materialise. Those I spoke to said that after months of drama and demonstrations, they expect one more attempt at a deal before the global markets deliver their finaljudgment. Our Economics Editor Robert Peston’s in Syntagma Square in Athens for us. Robert, I’m beginning to lose track of how many times I’ve asked this over the past couple of weeks, but what chance of a deal? Well probably not great tonight. Signals out of Berlin, Brussels and indeed from the IMF in Washington indicating that we are still a long way from seeing a report meant between Greece and its creditors. When I spoke to the Greek economy Minister earlier today, he told me that he thought there was a maximum of 48 hours for Greece to make sufficient progress for the world to be confident that Greece is staying in the euro. Now why is this the first deadline since the Syriza government was elected six months ago that is a real deadline? As I have been saying for the past 24 hours it is because the Greek banks are almost out of cash. And once banks are out of cash they cannot serve as the economy, the economy melts down. Right as we speak the European Central Bank is holding an emergency meeting to decide whether to give further emergency help to Greek banks, and the Greek banks themselves are meeting to determine how and whether they can open their doors tomorrow. If, and it seems very unlikely talking to central bankers, the ECB refuses to provide additional help to Greek banks then we are into the territory of the Greek government having to determine whether to leave the euro and readopt its own currency, a new kind of drachma, in order to try to save their banks by making emergency loans to them. We should be under no illusion, whether Greece stays or goes, the cost to the European Union will be enormous. Thank you. The Government has confirmed that the BBC is to take on the cost of free TV licences for the over 75s which is expected to cost the Corporation around £600 million a year. The Culture Secretary, john Whittingdale, told the Commons the measure would be included in Wednesdays Budget. He said that in return the government would introduce legislation to update the licence fee to include those watching on devices other than televisions. Our correspondent Nick Higham is outside the BBC’s London Headquarters. How does this all add up? At first sight it looks bad for the UK, it is about a fifth of the total budget, and the BBC was rather bounced into this. The shadow culture secretary Chris Bryant in the Commons called it a shabby little deal coming he said it was a smash and grab raid on the BBC. It is true that the chairman of the BBC trust and the director-general were only told about this by the Chancellor a week ago. But when I spoke to him a short while ago, Lord Hall really seemed quite upbeat. This gives us financial stability, to the whole organisation. It is not saying there won’t be hard choices, there will. But it gives financial stability and the ability to build the sort of organisation I really want to build, which is a world-class creative organisation. Why is he so happy? He says he has done a deal with the Chancellor, and there is £100 million of the licence fee now spent on rolling out broadband, the BBC is going to get that money back, and this business about modernising the licence fee so that people that watch catch up services like BBC I play, ITV player, will have to pay, they do not at present. At the end of five years, Lord Hall says, the BBC will be about where it is now in cash terms, though not necessarily in real terms. Even so he was not prepared to rule out some cuts in services. Our top story this evening. As the German Chancellor and her French counterpart meet for emergency talks, European ministers tell Greece no help to stay in the Eurozone unless you come up with a new plan. Still Later on BBC London: The family the family of Alice withdrawn from this weekend ‘s Scottish open. Many of those who were affected by events of 7/7 will come together tomorrow to remember the 52 people who were killed a decade ago in the London bombings and to reflect on a day which changed so many lives. On that morning relationships were forged which have endured over the past decade. june Kelly has been speaking to a 7/7 survivor and a tube driver who helped him. They’ve stayed in touch ever since. I’m the supervisor of Broadgate, we’vejust heard a big explosion. There’s people with blood coming down. Smoke coming from the tunnels, get as many ambulances as we can. If you guys hadn’t been there with your expertise, what would have happened? Phil Duckworth was among the most badly injured in the bomb near Aldgate station. Steve Eldridge, a tube driver, one of those who tended to him. On the 7th ofjuly they forged a bond which remains, ten years on. For me it was just a normal commute. I remember being stood at the door next to the partition. There was just a white flash. Everything just went blank and white, there was sort of a very loud ringing noise. And after that I don’t really remember anything until I came round on the tracks. And at some point I remember somebody shining a light on me and saying, oh, this one’s gone. And that’s what sort of gave me... I got sort of angry about that. They’d thought I’d died. I got a sort of adrenaline rush and managed to get onto my knees and then get up. And then people were trying to help me and I was falling over. And one of those people trying to help you was, of course, Steve? What do you remember about that, Steve? Itjust seemed a miracle. You walked past my left shoulder and Ijust looked and thought, where did he come from? Then it was a case of, he slumped on the wall, and we just had to catch you. And Phil, you sustained serious injuries? Well, I’d got a fragment of bone from the bomber in my left eye. |,m I’m blind in that eye. And my legs were badly damaged from the blast. And it was mainly my lungs as well, and my hearing had gone. Phil’s had some horrendous injuries, I know. But you’re still here, you know. I also think part of my personal recovery is to be pig-headed and carry on as I was. I guess it’s the sort of Yorkshire streak. And you two guys will always have this link? Yes. And do you think you’ll always be in touch? I’d like to think so, yes. Update the Christmas card list. Definitely. Tomorrow they’ll both be at the memorial service at St Paul’s Cathedral. Reflecting on a day which has woven together so many lives. One person ODE pâI’SOI’I I’âITI8iI’IS being hit by lightning in the Brecon Beacons in Wales. Two other walkers were killed in the same storm yesterday. A mountain rescue volunteer said the accident was the worst of its kind he’d seen in thirty years. Hywel Griffith has more. Exposed to the elements, even in summer, the weather on the Brecon Beacons can change in seconds. The violent storms that swept through yesterday saw lightning hit several peaks, striking down walkers on two different summits. Two Royal Marines Cadet instructors ran to help one of the men who’d been injured. He had a burn on his chest. Head wound and a burn on his leg as well. We were fairly sure at that point that he’d been struck, it wasn’t just a case that he’d passed out. It was something more serious going on. Three mountain rescue teams who’d been training nearby scrambled to try to reach the injured walkers and had to radio in for more help. Shrouded in cloud again now, the peakjust behind me is where one of the thunderbolts struck. An RAF Sea King helicopter had to be flown in through the storm to try to airlift the men to hospital. But when they got there the two of them were pronounced dead on arrival. A third man is still being treated at a specialist burns unit. For others caught up in the storm the experience was frightening. The sound, it was horrifying how quickly it changed. The thunder sounded so close. That could have been us if we were at the top of the hill. Multiple deaths from lightning strikes are very, very rare. Yesterday brought a sad reminder of nature’s destructive power. The Chancellor could receive a much larger tax windfall this year than expected with people using new freedoms to cash in their pension savings. The Treasury could get a boost of £700 million, double the anticipated. Let’s go and have a look at these geraniums on the left here. Suddenly this summer you can enjoy your pension as you want, but for the Morrises from Congleton, with £75,000 to dip into, pension freedom hasn’t been the rose garden they expected. Their provider says they have to cash it all in, or nothing. So the pension isn’t flexible to dip into like a bank account. They can transfer to another provider but some have high charges, and if they do take out all the money at once they face a tax bill at the 40% rate. My first thoughts were, I’ve got my fund, it’s my money. It comes as quite a shock to find that the taxman wants some back. Not some, could be 40%. Could be 40%. The tax implications could really sting. Today’s forecast from pension experts Hargreaves Lansdown that the Chancellor will snip off twice as much tax as expected has raised concerns that people are paying more than they need to. We are concerned that people might be paying more tax than they should when they try to access their pension. Our research shows as many as one in four are unaware as how much tax they have to pay. For those lucky enough to be dreaming about what to do with their pension money, a fancy holiday, a new car, or paying off some debt, tax will be the last thing on your mind. And yet it can take a big slice and end up with you giving a tidy sum to the Chancellor. The Treasury said over 60,000 people have already accessed £1 billion flexibly. The scenery should be spectacular. The freedoms are popular. 65-year-old Terry, packing for Las Vegas, will tap into £24,000 of pension money for more trips rather than having to buy an annuity. We’re hoping to go to Australia, New Zealand, the Far East, if we can. And this money will all help. It won’t be all used up but it will help to make it doable. else, be aware that some of the money could go to George Osborne to help with his budget on Wednesday. England’s players were greeted by fans at Heathrow Airport on their return from Canada, after an impressive performance at the Women’s World Cup. The team wore the bronze medals they won after defeating Germany 1-0 in the third-place play-off. But they were also greeted with an official FA tweet that’s prompted accusations of sexism. Katie Gornall has more. The most successful team in a generation. This is a squad that’s shed past baggage to travel further in Canada than many expected. We got better with each match. We wanted to win a medal first and foremost. The overall performance was fantastic and we deserve this Bronze today. Still time for a slip-up. The players can now go back to being mothers, partners and daughters, according to England’s official Twitter account. The post was later deleted. Nearly 2.5 million people watched England beat Germany for the first time to win World Cup Bronze. Theirjourney’s made national headlines and established some of the squad as household names. England’s players will have wanted nothing more than to be here in vamp could have and facing these American fans. But they came as close as they’d ever come to reaching the final and now it’s hoped their success at the World Cup can put them on a path to one day enjoying the kind of support and profile that the US national team has. That profile is on the rise after a spectacular Lloyd hat trick saw the USA beat japan 5-2 in the final to win the World Cup for a record third time. Their success is part of a legacy forged when the US last won the trophy back in 1999 and those within the English game are urging the FA to seize its own World Cup Spotlight. Next time this trophy is lifted, England will hope to have closed the gap and take their team to new highs. Andy Murray and Serena Williams are both into the quarter-finals. Welcome to so-called manic Monday with every player in action. The only problem for fans and officials is knowing where to look. For many, this was the answer. Andy Murray against six foot 11 Ivo Karlovic, facing him requiring courage. And ideally a crash helmet. As for trying to lob him, surely no-one would attempt that. Problems as Ka rlovic Karlovic responded. The third set was his, Murray’s frustration plain to see. His poise returned and soon it was all over. It was a struggle at times but Murray marches on. Over the years, the fans here on Centre Court have seen some famous rivalries, but today they saw the latest chapter of perhaps the most remarkable between two five times champions who just happened to be sisters. 15 years after their first meeting here, Serena and Venus were back, sibling rivalry played out on the biggest stage. It’s tended to provide more intrigue than classic matches and so it proved again, Serena winning in straight sets. Afterwards, she described her sister as inspirational. Elsewhere, the mood wasn’t quite as generous. Obscenity warning. After being warned for swearing, Nick Kyrgios briefly seemed to give up against Gasquet, the crowd less than impressed. He took it to four sets before losing, but he exits on the sourest of notes. It’s been a lively day here at Wimbledon but a good one for Andy Murray. He’s through to the quarter-finals for the eighth year in a row which is some record. He’ll now play Pospisil of Canada for a place in the semi-finals. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Matt Taylor. The south-easterly winds dominated last week and the warmest july day on record last week. We change the winds to more of a north-westerly and many struggling to get to 20 degrees, never mind 30. A short-lived spell. A slice of warmer air comes back, especially for the southern half of the UK and it’s south to south-westerly winds dominating tonight. Heaviest bursts across Scotland and Northern Ireland. Later on, wetter weather push fog the far south. Mid teens for most as we go into Tuesday morning, with plenty of cloud around. Bit of sunshine here and there. Lively bursts of rain potentially for the morning commute. Northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland should start the day dry. Sunshine wins through. A reasonably warm start to the day, but a wet start to the far north of Scotland and staying wet here all day long. The lively bursts of rain in East Anglia and south-east do clear through, in East Anglia and south-east do clearthrough, sunshine clear through, sunshine comes out, small risk of a shower during play at Wimbledon. We’ll see thunder storms work their way in from Wales to the Midlands and through to Yorkshire. Wet weather in Northern Ireland to finish the day. Feeling warm in the sunshine away from the showers. Thunder storms to end the day across the north-east of Scotland. Outbreaks of rain clearing and into Wednesday, the northerly winds again. Plenty of showers around. Feeling chilly in the showers but some sunshine overhead. That’s all from the BBC News at Six, we Tonight on BBC London News: We’re live from the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park as we look back on ten years since London was awarded the Olympic and Paralympic Games. From an industrial wasteland, we assess how a multi-billion pound Olympic makeover transformed this corner of East London. Plus the drive to get more youngsters into sport - the former Olympic Minister Dame Tessa jowell claims the opportunity has been squandered. There is no point in simply saying, ""Well, we have given schools all this money."" It won’t be spent on sport. Also on the programme: From jubilation to despair- A decade on, former Mayor Ken Livingstone talks to us about 48 hours which defined London. Londoners will not be divided by this cowardly attack. They will stand together in solidarity. And questions surrounding security at the Wireless festival as gatecrashers force their way into the event. Good evening and welcome to the programme. I’m Asad Ahmad. Good evening and welcome to a special programme live from the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park ten years to the day that London discovered it had won the Olympic and Paralympic Games and the chance to transform one of the most deprived parts of the capital. In a moment we’ll be hearing how the regeneration of this area has transformed the lives of those living and working nearby. But first - from the outset it was Paris who were favourites to host the games. In the end, London’s dynamic and visionary bid won over IOC. I was in Singapore for the announcement and have been looking back on that moment and what swung it for London. The 2012 Olympic Games are awarded to the city of London! It was the moment which London Olympic bid optimists were hoping for, but few thought it would ever happen. Paris were the hot favourites, but in those final 48 hours in Singapore, London pulled it back, but how? And in the audience, 38 between 12 and 18... Sebastian Coe said the children of East London where his secret weapon. No one else had thought of doing it, and the impact was massive. This man too, an East London local, also had quite an effect. How much does it mean to have the Olympics in your hood, and how much will it change the lives of local people in the area, who tonight will be holding their breath? I think to have Olympics in my manor... The London bid films, combined with an inspired presentation, changed the tide in London’s favour. The result? ",,

Film-makerjay Bulger captures a warts and all portrait of this percussive genius. Tonight at Ten: The mounting pressure on Greece from the European Central Bank. Cash machines will run out of money by Wednesday night unless a bailout deal is agreed. In Paris, Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande consider their next move, as the UK prepares for a possible Greek exit from the Euro. The situation risks going from bad to worse. Britain will be affected the longer the Greek crisis lasts and the worse it gets. There is no easy way out. We’ll have the latest from Athens where there’s a new Finance Minister in place to try to broker a deal. Also tonight: The BBC is to pay for the TV licences of the over-75s, as part of a new financial settlement. The BBC has agreed to play its part in contributing to reductions in spending, like much of the rest of the public sector, whilst at the same time, further reducing its overall reliance on taxpayers. We report on the surge of migrants on the Greek island of Lesbos, where local shelters are overwhelmed. And at Wimbledon, Andy Murray reaches the quarter-finals for the eighth consecutive year. Later on BBC London: Ten years after London was awarded the Olympics, Dame Tessa jowell says the opportunity to ""inspire a generation"" has been wasted. And security questions after gatecrashers force their way into the Wireless Festival. Good evening. The European Central Bank has tonight increased the pressure on the Greek banks, placing new conditions on financial support. The Greek government has acknowledged that it now has until Wednesday night to agree a new bailout deal with its international creditors. Greek banks are on the verge of collapse, and tomorrow, there’s to be an emergency summit of Eurozone leaders. From Athens, our economics editor, Robert Peston reports. The day after Greece’s historic vote against the bailout offered by the rest of the eurozone, Greeks queued to get their hands on the up to 60 euros they are allowed before all the cash runs out. I am worried about the future. I believe that we’re on the right path. We are not fortune tellers. And we don’t know what will happen. The pillar of any economy is a country’s banks, who look after our savings and who look after our savings and provide vital finance for businesses. But Greece’s banks are crumbling. They are just days away from running out of cash, which is why they are desperate for their survival for emergency loans from this imposing organisation, the Bank of Greece. But the Bank of Greece is powerless to provide that emergency help without permission from the European Central Bank in Frankfurt. Tonight, the ECB did the opposite of what Greek banks want. It told them they have to hand over more assets in return for the emergency loans they have already received, and that has the effect of bringing forward the fateful day when they totally one out of cash. when they totally run out of cash. the forced resignation of this man, Yanis Varoufakis, as finance minister, who got firmly up the nose of creditors, may improve the climate for rescue talks, a bit. This man is what Greece needs many more of- a high-tech entrepreneur, who provides work via his smartphone app to 4,000 Athens taxi drivers. But like most Greek businesses, he’s hurting. The banks are shut, so you can’t get money. We can’t get our money. This is the money we use to pay our employees. The taxi business has been decreased by 20-25% this week. As the minister of the economy knows too well, no company is immune to the depressing impact of the banking crisis. What’s of particular concern to Greeks is that the absence of credit means stocks of imported food, raw materials and medicines are running dangerously low. It’s correct, isn’t it, that there are literally A8 hours, at most, to keep Greece in the single currency? 1+8, or it might be a week or ten days. It’s up to the negotiation process to find out the solution. But this is the last moment? That’s definite, because, as you know, at this point there is T10 pI’ogI’STT’ITT’Iâ. Nice to see you. Hello. Cafe life may not look too grim, but it’s deceptive. How has it felt since the banks closed? How difficult has it been? We are feeling terrible to stay in the lines for hours. 60 euros - it’s nothing. It’s not enough, you know, to survive. It’s been, for sure, very hard, because we are four people in the house, to pay for medication, food and for our every day needs. What a day for this man, Alexis Tsipras. Greece’s Prime Minister, stronger than ever thanks to his referendum win. But facing his greatest ever test - two days to decide whether he can save Greece’s banks without exiting the euro. Chancellor Merkel of Germany has been holding talks in Paris with President Hollande, trying to work out their next move, amid signs of deepening divisions, between some of the Eurozone countries, on the right approach. The Dutch Prime Minister says Greece must adopt wide-ranging reforms if it wants to remain in the euro. Our chief correspondent, Gavin Hewitt, is in Paris. Well, Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande met tonight, here under real pressure. Two other European leaders spoke up today and said things simply can’t go on this way. And the White House got involved, saying there needed now to be a compromise and the message coming from Paris here tonight was directed at Alexis Tsipras, the Greek Prime Minister. You have to come up with new proposals by the emergency summit tomorrow. Europe’s two most powerful leaders met for dinner tonight, trying to fashion a response to Greek voters who had so firmly rejected more austerity. President Hollande believes that talks with the Greek government have to resume. TRANSLATION: The door is now open for discussions and it’s now up to the government of Alexis Tsipras to make proposals, serious and credible ones, so that this desire of the Greek people to remain in the Eurozone can be translated into reality. Angela Merkel has been cautious in her response, but she firmly placed responsibility for the next move on the shoulders of the Greek Prime Minister. TRANSLATION: Time is of the essence, and we insist that Greek proposals must be on the table this week, so we can deal with the situation the way it is at the moment. These were restrained comments. Back at home, Angela Merkel knows the mood is hardening. In political circles in Berlin, there is a widely held view that the Greek vote changed nothing. The message here was that there was currently no basis to enter into negotiations with Greece on a new aid programme. The problem that Berlin has with the Greek government is trust. It no longer believes that promises made about future reforms will necessarily be carried out. And without trust, Angela Merkel will struggle to sell any future bailout agreements to the German people. Dr Norbert Roettgen is an MP from Angela Merkel’s party. You can’t rescue a country against its will, and you can’t give solidarity without the readiness to accept solidarity and to contribute all efforts. He believes Greece can’tjust stay in the euro, but need to explore adopting a parallel currency. Elsewhere in Europe, other leaders will take some convincing that they can continue helping the Greeks. The Dutch Prime Minister, Mark Rutte, said ""It can’t go on like this. ""Greece has to take difficult decisions to make ""its economy healthy"". In these uncertain times, theyjust happen to be dismantling the sign of the euro outside the former headquarters of the European Central Bank. Angela Merkel left the Elysee Palace tonight knowing how hard it will be to find a solution at tomorrow’s summit to keep Greece and the euro together. Gavin Hewitt, BBC News, Paris. So, what is the likely effect of the continuing Greek crisis on the UK economy? The Chancellor, George Osborne, says the prospects of a happy resolution to the Greek debt problem are diminishing and the risks for Britain are growing. Our business editor, Kamal Ahmed, has been assessing the UK’s FESPOFISE. Oxi, oxi, oxi! In whatever language, Greece’s resounding no to Europe’s austerity plan was loud and clear. 1,500 miles away, they were celebrating, but how far will the momentous events centred on Athens affect Britain? Let’s start with the economy. Here’s the Governor of the Bank of England, leaving an emergency meeting this morning with the Prime Minister and the Chancellor. Are there risks to the British economy? He didn’t have much to say, leaving it to George Osborne to tell Parliament just how serious things were becoming. This is a critical moment in the economic crisis in Greece. No one should be under any illusions. The situation risks going from bad to worse. Britain will be affected the longer the Greece crisis lasts and the worse it gets. There is no easy way out, but even at the 11th hour, we urge the Eurozone leaders and Greece to find a sustainable solution. As a member of the IMF, the UK is owed £1 billion by Greece. That is considerably less than other members of the Eurozone. For example, EAO billion is owed to Germany. As a trading partner, Greece only represents 1.2% of all the UK’s exports to the European Union, so the impact here of its economic problems is limited. But when it comes to holidays, there were 1.7 million visits to Greece in 2014. It’s one of the UK’s most popular destinations, and there is some evidence that that figure is higher this year. Tourism is big business, and people jetting off today were advised to take plenty of cash. At Stansted, there were concerns. I went to the euro change place and changed all my money up, which was scary, because I have to carry it with me. We have enough cash. As long as I’m not stupid, we’ll be fine, yeah. As holiday- makers soaked up the sun on the beaches of Greece, the travel industry was urging calm. In the resorts and hotels, we’re hearing that it’s business as usual. Hotels are running as normal. Customers are able to take money out from the majority of ATMs, and supermarkets are well stocked. But what about the markets? In London, Frankfurt and Paris, stock exchanges were down. The value of the euro fell, but the volatility predicted by many didn’t materialise. Senior market figures I’ve spoken to said that after months of drama and demonstrations, they expect one more attempt at a deal before the global markets deliver their finaljudgment. Kamal Ahmed, BBC News. In a moment, we’ll have the latest from Robert Peston in Athens, but first our political editor, Nick Robinson, in Westminster. just wondering really, we have spoken a lot about the financial and economic impact. Let’s talk about the political dimension of this crisis as you see it. Well, standing here, ratherthan crisis as you see it. Well, standing here, rather than standing in say Athens or Paris tonight, it is easy to imagine that Britain is pretty much immune. After all, we are not in the eurozone. The British economy is not much exposed to the Greek banks, but the Chancellor was keen to stress today that would be a mistake. Partly that is for political reasons. He is going to deliver a potentially unpopular Budget on Wednesday w its own dose of austerity and spending cuts and welfare cults, so it suits him to -- welfare cuts, so it suits him. He knows that any knock on from our principled trading partners, any consequences for the markets would hit Britain as well. There is a political knock on, much longer term than that. What we are seeing already is that many on the left have concluded that after this referendum it is both possible and popular to stand up to austerity. Many who are anti the EU, largely on the right of politics, think it is possible to stand up to Berlin and to stand up to Brussels and they will take that message into the referendum on Britain’s message, of Britain’s membership of the EU, probably as soon as next autumn. The final thought, probably as soon as next autumn. The finalthought, it final thought, it is a reminder those things, referendum, they have very, very unpredictable, political and economic outturns. Thank you very much for now. Our economics editor, Robert Peston, is in Athens for us now. How do you see the next few days? If the Greek Brahmin is to somehow thought that the resounding rejection -- thought that the resounding rejection -- if the Greek panellist for the rejection of the bailout terms announced by the Greek people yesterday would somehow make those Eurozone governments and the IMF somewhat more emollient in trying to find a rescue, he has been cruelly disappointed. The signals from the office of Angela Merkel, the most powerful politician in Europe, the Chancellor of Germany, is that she sees no prospect of a big breakthrough any time soon in rescue talks. Perhaps more importantly, the European Central Bank has intensified the squeeze on Greek banks. As I have been saying for the past 48 hours, they are perilously close to running out of cash. The actions that the European Central Bank has taken tonight mean that broadly, the Greek banking system will be out of options by Wednesday night, out of cash by Wednesday night if there is no breakthrough in the bailouts negotiations. Alexis Tsipras has been on the phone today to Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank, begging him to allow some more emergency landing. Talking to central bankers tonight, I see no prospect of that, as that is forcing a really difficult calculation now for Alexis Tsipras. Capitulate to his creditors, or contemplate leaving the creditors, or contemplate leaving the euro and therefore, by creating a new currency, somehow rescuing his banks with that new currency. But neither road for Greece is easy. Neither road for Greece will be other than very painful. Robert Peston in Athens and Nick Downing Street in Downing Street -- Peston in Athens and Nick Downing Street in Downing Street -- Nick Robinson in Downing Street, thank you. The BBC has agreed to bear the cost of providing free TV licences to viewers aged over 75. It’s expected to cost over £700 million a year by 2020, but the BBC says it’s part of a wider financial settlement, which means the BBC will not be worse off in cash terms. The BBC licence fee will be pegged to inflation, and it will also be extended to include those watching on catch-up services, including the iPlayer, as Nick Higham explains. At first sight, it’s bad news for the BBC - less money for programmes because around a fifth of its total budget is effectively being hived off. But the BBC says it’s done a deal with the Government, and it’s really rather pleased. After weekend leaks, the new arrangement was confirmed unexpectedly this afternoon. The BBC will take on the cost of providing free television licences for those households over 75. This will be phased in from 2018-19, with the BBC taking on the full costs from 2020-21. This is the deal worked out behind closed doors injust a week. The cost of free TV licences for the over-75s is around £700 million a year, but to help pay for that, the BBC has been promised a return to licence fee rises in line with inflation. People watching only catch-up services like the BBC iPlayer and ITV Player will have to pay the licence fee, and the BBC will get back £150 million, which now goes on paying for the roll-out of broadband. This gives us financial stability to the whole organisation. It’s not saying there will not be hard choices, but it gives us financial stability and the ability to build the sort of organisation I want to build, which is a world-class creative organisation. Lord Hall says the BBC will be no worse off in cash terms at the end of the next five years than it is now, and may even be a little better off. But he’s still not ruling out possible cuts in services. Meanwhile, the Chancellor is happy because he has managed to make a big cut in Government welfare spending, and if at some point in the future, the BBC wants to modify the concession to over-75s in some way, well, it will be the BBC, not the Government, that takes any flak. But there has been criticism of the way the deal was done, as there was five years ago when the BBC agreed to take on funding World Service radio. In the Lords, a former BBC director-general weighed in. This has taken a huge slice out of the BBC’s budget. Again, it has happened with no public discussion of any kind. This Government and the last Government have essentially set S VâI’y d8I’1gâI’oUS pI’âCâdâIâ1t. The BBC believes it now has a secure future, but the BBC Trust complained that in all this, no one consulted the licence payers. Nick Higham, BBC News. Police on the Greek island of Lesbos are reporting a big increase in the number of migrants. They say 1,600 arrived on Saturday, breaking all previous records. Many are believed to be fleeing the conflict in Syria. As our correspondent Anna Holligan reports, the island’s only detention facility is overwhelmed, and a makeshift camp set up on an abandoned race track is also unable to cope. On the intellect I love Lesbos, -- on the intellect I love Lesbos, here is where they welcomed the refugees. Some tell me Syria was paradise compared to this. The first shock is this scene. This man is 29 years old. I have been here forfour days. In Aleppo, I was feeling safe because that is where I was born. But it was going away day by day, seeing people getting killed, losing too many friends. And then getting bullets around me so many times, I survived by chance and I could not take more chances. Like so many of the 2000 people now living here, he paid a smuggler to get him into Europe illegally. It is a sewage swamp. It is a catastrophe for health. And you describe the smell? It is garbage, and you feel like they’re dead bodies. There are no dead bodies, but it smells like that, because I have smelt that in Syria and it smells that. At dawn, a Navy ship patrols. The refugees set sail from Turkey, while in what was left of their hopes and possessions into an inflatable dinghies. Last month, an average of 500 people a day made this voyage to Lesbos. The tide is swelling. Actually, it is a very short way, so hopefully, there are very few deaths. I no one is too many, but compared to other ways, this is the safest one. Here at the island’s only official reception centre, they can apply for temporary visas. There is space for 700 people. The authorities are now dealing with more than four times that amount. And now they are pleading for painkillers, plasters for their blisters, cream to heal his rash. The aid agency doctors without borders is sending a rapid response team. They will not arrive until later this week. The most important treatment is to be treated as a human being. It is hard to hold it together here. Tomorrow, the victims of the London bombings will be remembered, a decade after terrorist bombs killed 52 people and injured more than 700. One of those killed in the bus bomb in Tavistock Square was 26-year-old Anthony Fatayi-Williams. In the days that followed, his mother Marie made a deeply emotional speech during the search for him. Our special correspondent Fergal Keane has been to meet her, ten years on. My son Anthony is my first son, my only son. 26. My only son, the head of my family. She became a defining voice in a time of trauma. He has dreams and hopes, and I, his mother, must fight to protect them. Anthony Fatayi-Williams was a life-loving 26-year-old, an oil company executive murdered on his way to work. Ten years after she lost her son, Marie told me what the anniversary means to her. Loneliness, a lot of sadness. A lot of unfulfilled dreams. A lot of... ""Oh, I wish I could put back the hands of the clock. ""Oh, I wish I had done this. ""Oh, I wish he was here"". Missing him so badly. He had a very strong shoulder for me to lean on. He had strong arms. He cared for me, loved me, would enfold me in his arms, call me. I miss his voice, I miss his smile, I miss the way he says ""Mummy"". He had a special way he called me. There’s now a memorial plaque at Tavistock Square to remember Anthony and the 12 other victims of this man, 18-year-old Hasib Hussain, the youngest of the 7/7 bombers. Do you forgive the young man who went on to that bus on Tavistock Square and killed your son? I struggled to learn of his name and to pronounce his name, because I believed that that was the beginning of me acknowledging him as a person who did this, and then if I’m able to pronounce his name, Hasib Hussain, it means I’m able to accept that he did what he did to Anthony and I will start to forgive him. If I don’t forgive him, what will happen to me? I will get eaten up. In the wake of 7/7, Marie was one of the leading voices for tolerance. Hatred begets only hatred. It is time to stop this vicious cycle of killing. Among most Britons, that message has endured. But she was to be disappointed in her hope that the bombings would prove a turning point in the battle against terrorism. Ten years on, see what is happening. See the pain all the mothers are going through. See the pain that many more families are going through. And I ask myself, do we really understand what is going on? Have we learned any lessons? Have we drawn anything from 7/7? Marie now campaigns for peace through a foundation set up in Anthony’s name, but she has never let go of the private wishes of a mother. I wish you the very best. I wish your spirit and your soul to rise to the heights of God’s glory, and I want to say goodbye, my love. I will hold you in my dreams, until we meet again. That was Marie Fatayi-Williams, whose son died in the Tavistock Square bus bomb, speaking to Fergal Keane. Football, and the USA has won the Women’s World Cup. They beat japan 5-2 in the final in Vancouver. The Americans scored four times in the first 15 minutes. They’re now the first nation to win the World Cup three times. And the England team arrived home this morning after winning their third place play-off against Germany. This report by Katie Gornall contains some flash photography. They left with hope and returned as history-makers, the most successful England team in a generation. This is a squad that has shed past baggage to travel further in Canada than many expected. With every match, we got better and better. We wanted to come away with a medal. We wanted the winner’s medal, first and foremost. But the overall performance of the squad, they were fantastic and we deserved the bronze medal today. There was still time for a slip-up. The players can now ""go back to being mothers, ""partners and daughters"", according to England’s official Twitter account. The post was later deleted. Nearly 2.5 million people watched England beat Germany for the first time to win World Cup bronze. Theirjourney in Canada has made national headlines and established some of the squad as household names. England’s players would have wanted nothing more than to be here in Vancouver and facing these American fans, but they came as close as they’ve ever come to reaching the final, and now it’s hoped that their success at the World Cup can put them on a path to one day enjoying the kind of support and profile that the US national team has. That profile is on the rise after a spectacular Carli Lloyd hat trick saw the USA beat japan 5-2 in the final to win the World Cup for a record third time. Their success is part of a legacy forged when the US last won the trophy back in 1999. Those within the English game want to seize this world spotlight. The next time this trophy is lifted, England will hope to have closed the gap on the world’s best and have taken the game back home to new heights. Katie Gornall, BBC News, Vancouver. Britain’s Chris Froome has come second in the third stage of the Tour de France in Belgium to take the leader’s yellowjersey. The stage was dominated by two heavy crashes that twice saw the race briefly stopped. Swiss rider Fabian Cancellara was injured in the first pile-up and lost the overall lead to 2013 winner Froome. At Wimbledon, Andy Murray has reached the quarter-finals after beating Ivo Karlovic in four sets. But the defending champion, Novak Djokovic, will have to wait to see if he canjoin him after his match with Kevin Anderson was suspended for bad light at 2-2. Our correspondent Andy Swiss was watching. Champion, top seed, favourite, but if the fans expected a Novak Djokovic procession, they were in for a giant shock. At six foot eight, Kevin Anderson is one of the sport’s guest servers, but he was soon proving there is rather more to his game. And in a first set tie-break, guess what? Anderson seized it, and that wasjust tie-break, guess what? Anderson seized it, and that was just the start. It went from bad to worse for Djokovic, as Anderson edged the second set, playing the match of his life. But in the nick of time, Djokovic relocated his brilliance. By the time he levelled it up at 2-2, the emotions were plain to see. But with the light fading, play was promptly suspended. So as the fans head home tonight, the champion was mY head home tonight, the champion was my fate is hanging in the balance. They will resume tomorrow for what promises to be a dramatic deciding set. As for Andy Murray, he was up against another hefty obstacle, six foot 11 Ivo Karlovic. Facing him also requires courage and ideally a crash helmet. As for lobbing him, well, who would be silly enough to try that? While, Murray was, with impressive results. A 2-set lead. But then more problems, as Karlovic responded, taking the third set. Murray’s frustration was all too obvious. But his poise returned, and soon it all over. An incredibly difficult match. It is mentally tiring. It is not as physically difficult, but mentally it is tiring, because you need to focus on every single point. And you have to be ready when your chances come. It has been a struggle at times, but Murray marches on. And the Swiss, BBC News, Wimbledon. Now on BBC One, it’s time for the news where you are. Welcome to BBC London News. I’m Alice Bhandhukravi.

A prisoner custody officer, who was attacked while on duty outside a court in central London on Monday, has died. Lorraine Barwell was 54 and had worked for security firm Serco for more than a decade. The company says it’s conducting a major review of procedures. Frankie McCamley reports. Our popular and a brave women, known as Rocky by her friends. Lorraine Barwell was attacked in this Court on Monday as she and her colleagues were getting ready to escort a prisoner between the building and a waiting van. She was treated at the scene before being airlifted to hospital where she was put on life support. But the 5lI-year-old later died from her injuries. Rupert Soames is the chief executive of Serco, a prison transport service where she worked. In a statement he said: Lorraine was a brave and experienced prisoner custody officer who was a popular and highly respected member of our team popular and highly respected member of ourteam and of our team and had worked Serco for over ten years. She will be sorely missed by everyone who worked with her. Lorraine Barwell is believed to be the first prison custody officer to have died in a line of duty. The first death to result from violence on a member of prison staff is understood to be 24 years ago at Norwich prison. This is a very tragic situation and obviously thoughts go out to the family and friends of Lorraine. It is a sad day for the criminaljustice system, it is a sad day for the prison service, and obviously it is a very sad day for the family. 22-year-old Humphrey Burke appeared at Camberwell Green Magistrates’ Court charged with causing grievous bodily harm on Wednesday. He remains in custody. Today as a postmortem is carried out, Scotland Yard have confirmed they are now carrying out a murder enquiry. This case has been described as a stark reminder of the challenging job protection people like Lorraine carry out everyday. The head of the children’s charity Kids Company, has rejected criticism of the way the organisation is run. The government is withholding funds until it’s founder Camila Batmanghelidjh is replaced, following concerns about the charity’s ability to manage its finances. She’s now agreed to step down, but says she’d always planned to do So I’IâXl year aI’IyWay. She’s accused politicians of trying to discredit her. In just A8 hours time, the people of Greece will be given their say on the country’s bailout crisis, in a crucial referendum. The rival ‘yes’ and ‘no’ camps are planning to hold simultaneous rallies in Athens but even at this late stage, the country’s highest court is considering a bid to have the referendum halted on the grounds that it violates the constitution. Chris Morris is in Athens. Good afternoon, it is all a bit frenetic, a bit chaotic and there are continuing concerns about whether this referendum will meet international standards. In the next few hours we should hear from the Constitutional Court about whether it believes it violates the country’s constitution or not but for the moment it is all systems go. These are the days which will define Alexis Tsipras’s political future as the first radical left-wing Prime Minister of Greece. On Greek TV last night he repeated his insistence that the referendum is a boat against austerity and no will strengthen his hand. If no prevails he says, I reassure you the next day I will be in Brussels and the referendum will be signed -- I will be in Brussels and the referendum will be signed -- the agreement will be signed. They are setting the stage for his appearance at a big no rally this evening. Expect more defiance, more accusations that the rest of the Eurozone is trying to blackmail this country into submission. And on lamp posts across the country the other poster boy of the no campaign, the German finance minister. He has been sucking your blood for five years, it says, it is time to tell him no. Down the road another stage under construction, this is where the yes campaign will rally its supporters. They say and no would be catastrophic and the Prime Minister is deluded. Supporters of the yes campaign argue that Greece’s future in the Eurozone is at stake. It needs a deal with the creditors that the government has rejected. They hope Nisse Sauerland majority will stand with them. It is not kind to scare them, it is the reality. When people talk about closed banks and month ago they were accused of scaremongering but this is happening now. Evilare scaremongering but this is happening now. Evil are already suffering so it is not scaring people, it is telling them the truth. There has been no referendum campaign as such, just a few short, chaotic days during which Greece’s negotiations with its creditors have grown to a halt and this country’s economy has come close to breaking point. Even as ballot papers are hastily shipped around the country the banks remain closed and opinion polls seem to close to call. These are critical days, notjust for Greece but close to call. These are critical days, not just for Greece but also for Europe’s big project, the single currency, of which Greece is still, just, a member. The pressure on the government continues to mount, business leaders say banks have literally run out of cash so the idea that they might be able to reopen next week is in doubt. In Brussels, jean-Claude juncker has said and no vote would dramatically weaken Greece’s position. Or Alexis Tsipras, it looks like if he is going down is going to go down fighting. The NHS ""can and should do better"", at preventing unnecessary hospital admissions, and improving survival rates among those who suffer a serious illness. That’s the conclusion of new research from The Nuffield Trust and the Health Foundation, which compared the UK’s performance to other developed countries. Here’s our Health Correspondent Dominic Hughes. We want you to step up and then back down. Nice and gentle. An exercise class specifically to help cancer patients with their recovery. Both physically and mentally. It is very isolating if you have got cancer and you tend to put on a front for your friends and family and here you have exercise, I have lost weight and I have people suffering the same so you can be honest. It has improved my mood no end. It is quite depressing, feeling less and less fit all the time. Exercise classes like this one in Salford are a vital way of helping people recover from serious illnesses like cancer or heart disease and keeping them healthy in the future. The message from today’s research is actually quite encouraging, it shows that in many areas big strides have been taken to improve the quality of care we all receive. But there are also some areas where the UK health care system It is not performing as it should. So while the number of deaths following a stroke has improved, it is still higher than many comparable countries. Death from heart attacks have also been reduced but here as well the UK does not match the best. The big concern is that over the next few years not much extra money is going into the health service at a point when demand is increasing, if we can hold onto that position is in doubt. The authors accept that international comparisons are tricky, data can be collected in different ways, but this report suggests that whilst progress is being made there is some way to go before we match the very best in the world. Dominic Hughes, BBC News. Our top story this lunchtime. A minute’s silence is observed across the UK to remember the victims of the Tunisia terror attack a week ago. Coming up, a busy day at Wimbledon as British fans get up for a Centre Court clash between Heather Watson and Serena Williams. Later on BBC London: The downside of the warm weather- the RNLI sees a big rise in the number of people it’s rescuing from the Thames. And it’s their home race - but are McLaren’s chances of success slim in this weekend’s British Grand Prix? Marine life as we know it could be irreversibly changed, unless carbon dioxide emissions are drastically cut. That’s the stark warning from experts writing in the journal Science, who say climate change is heating up the oceans and making them more acidic. It follows studies examining sediment from the sea bed dating back 55 million years. Roger Harrabin has the story. Coral reefs, one of nature’s marvels. Now under threat from our emissions of carbon dioxide. Co2 is a mildly acidic gas and these natural Co2 vents in Papua allow scientists to assess which creatures will survive as our Co2 emissions make the seas more acidic everywhere. The branching corals that provide shelter for fish are unlikely to last the century. In Germany, they are experimenting to see how creatures can withstand the multiple impacts we are having on the oceans. These organisms, they can cope with elevated temperatures, they can cope with heat, they can cope with increased Co2 with acidification, but they have problems coping with both of them at the same time. Scientists are also looking to the past for lessons. They’ve drilled into the ocean floor to take long samples, tracing a timeline over millions of years. The samples are chalky white for millions of years, from the fossils of tiny shellfish. That’s until this dramatic point, 55 million years ago, when the ocean suddenly got hotter and more acidic and the shellfish disappeared. It took shellfish 160,000 years to recover and scientists here say we humans are changing the seas ten times faster than at this catastrophic event. From the samples here in Bremen, scientists conclude that we will have irreversibly changed the seas by 2100. Some ocean systems will benefit from the changes we are inadvertently making, especially in the short-term, but the report says most will suffer unless we radically cut emissions of Co2. Trials of a gene therapy for cystic fibrosis suggest a new treatment could be made available within five years. In the study, patients were given healthy genes to breathe in, to help correct the problem in their lungs. Early results showed slight improvements, but scientists say more work is needed to make the treatment truly effective. Here’s our science correspondent, Pallab Ghosh. Kieran Kelly is 31. He has cystic fibrosis. It’s caused by a faulty gene which stops his lungs from working properly. He has to take dozens of different pills each day to live a normal life. The average life expectancy is A1, but Kieran and his fiancee Nadia are positive and they plan to get married at the end of this month. You live every day that you’ve got, be as positive as you can and just live your life, enjoy it. You’ve always got to be quite hopeful. When we first met, I think it was the average life expectancy for someone with cystic fibrosis was 28, so it’s gone up since then. But every time you see any kind of medical developments, it’s always so encouraging. Kieran has been taking part in a trial of a new genetic treatment. He inhales copies of the healthy gene into his lungs. These are absorbed by the damaged cells inside. The healthy gene takes up the role of the faulty one, shown in red. The hope is this will stop the lungs from getting worse. Or even make them work a little better. For the first time in the world we are beginning to show that by giving gene therapy repeatedly, we can improve the workings of the lungs in these patients. Now, we have to caveat that I think a little bit, by saying the changes we saw were modest. This powder contains the genes that seem to help the patients, but it’s far from ready to be used in the clinic yet. Doctors still need to find a way of making it more effective, but they say these early results show in principle that gene therapy could work. What are you looking at? Any treatment probably won’t be ready in time to help Kieran. But he and his fiancee are hopeful about the future as they plan for their wedding. Prepay energy customers are paying up to ÂlIoo a year more for their energy than others on the cheapest deals. Citizens Advice say customers using the meters are more likely to be on low incomes. Our industry correspondent john Moylan has the story. Pensioner Brenda Aicarda from Newport likes the peace of mind of paying upfront for her energy. She uses a prepayment meter but she thinks it’s unfair that she ends up paying over the odds. I definitely pay more. I’ve looked into this. We are paying a lot more. I don’t understand the reasons at all. I think it’s totally unfair that having a prepayment meter, we’ve got to pay more. According to new research, people like Brenda have been paying on average £226 more than those on the cheapest tariffs. That’s a difference of 22% in annual bills. At one supplier, the Co-op, the difference was more than ÂlIoo. It’s now said that it will cut its prepayment rates. These are not the people that we want to see pay a couple of hundred pounds more a year than everybody else and that’s what we want to uncover. Why is it that we can’t see decent competitive deals coming forward in this market to help the people that actually need the help the most. One in six energy customers use prepayment meters. These are often low-income households. Today, the message from the industry was shop around. My reaction is to urge anyone that’s watching and is concerned about how much they are paying via prepayment for example, really get onto a comparison site, because you could save an awful lot of money by making sure you’re on the best possible deal. But they do have fewer options for switching. I don’t think that’s true today. There are 18 different companies that are offering prepayment tariffs. An industrywide probe to be published next week is expected to focus on the plight of vulnerable customers. Citizens Advice thinks those on prepayment meters, like Brenda, should get a better deal. It’s day five at Wimbledon, and everyone’s still talking about the shock exit of Rafael Nadal last night. He lost to the qualifier Dustin Brown, ranked 102 in the world. Later today, the British number one Heather Watson will attempt a similar upset, when she takes on the world number one Serena Williams. Our sports correspondent Natalie Pirks is there for us now. Perhaps Heather watched that performance of Dustin Brown yesterday thinking, that’s how you do it. He played with zero pressure on centre court against a legend. It’s the fourth year in a row that Rafael Nadal has bombed out of the early stages. Now everyone is asking, are his glory days on grass numbered? Another dream comes true on centre court. As he pounded a tattoo of his father in triumph, Centre Court took a man called Dreddy into their hearts. The six foot five German Dustin Brown captivated fans with his aggression... ..and at times barefaced cheek. It may have been his first time on centre court, but the occasion never once overwhelmed him, dragging his opponent out of position and out of his comfort zone. Rafa Nadal has earned almost £50 million in winnings, but for the player who used to travel to events in a camper van this win was priceless. It’s easy for me to play my game against someone like him because I have nothing to lose. If I lose 6-1, 6-2, 6-3, everyone says ""Bravo Rafa"" and that obviously makes it a lot easier for me especially playing that type of way. Nadal has looked short of confidence on the green green grass of SW19 since 2012. Once you lose your aura, it’s hard to get it back. I would be really surprised if he got to another semi or final at Wimbledon. The other surfaces, no doubt. I think grass is a tough one. Things are going far better for Britain, with three British players in the third round for the first time since 2002. Andy Murray and james Ward will play tomorrow, one shouldering the expectation of the nation, the other being willed on with hope. james Ward’s win yesterday pushed the 28-year-old into the top 100 for the first time. Plenty for Heather Watson to ponder today, predominantlyjust how you stop the tennis equivalent of a steam roller. Her opponent already holds three of the four big titles. Can Watson stop her romping to the Serena slam? Heather could perhaps ta ke Heather could perhaps take heart from the fact that Serena has gone out at the third and fourth round in the last two years. But she will need to bring her a game to stop the Serena express. She’s used to reaching speeds in excess of lIomph, now Britain’s most successful female Olympian, Victoria Pendleton, has switched saddles to make her debut as an amateurjockey. The double Olympic cycling champion finished eighth out of 11 at Newbury, after riding a horse for the very first time just four months ago. joe Wilson has more. Victoria Pendleton about to set forth on a saddle. That’s where any familiarity ends. She conquered cycling. Two wheels is certainly tough but the progress is repeatable. Four legs and a mind of its own - that’s horse racing. Mighty Mambo was the name of the animal, look screen right for the red cap as Pendleton consciously kept out of trouble at the back. It was a charity race but most of the riders were vastly experienced. Pendleton finished in a group, seventh place, she felt. Eighth, most observers said. Not acceptable on a bike - it was here. I want to do a nice clean performance and not look out of place and I hope that I achieved that. Ultimately next time I think I’ll be in a different frame of mind but now I’ve got that first one out of the way, box ticked, I can move on and see what else I can do. Victoria Pendleton has made her debut racing here in the flat. Remember, her ambition is to compete at the prestigious Cheltenham Festival next year and that will mean taking on jumps the size of this. Words can’t explain what it feels like. It’s a tremendous feeling and anybody that tries it would understand, so maybe, yeah, addictive. Well, the path Pendleton set out for herself, it’s about the most dangerous sport can offer. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Ben Rich. A little while, but it’s one of those sunny summer days when it’s hard to imagine anything could go wrong. Friday will have a sting in the tail, with severe thunderstorms, which will affect some areas this evening and tonight. All the ingredients for thunderstorms. Heat on the near continent wafting in our direction. Thunderclouds are developing in the south, moving in this direction. It’s hard to imagine anything could change out there because it’s a fine day with plenty of sunshine. A bit of iCloud turning the sunshine hazy. Making it feel cool on the eastern coasts, especially combined with the breeze. 18-19 degrees on the coast. Elsewhere, it could get to 28-29 in the south-east. This evening, this is where things change. We are expecting some quite scattered thunderstorms across the South West and South Wales. A bit of uncertainty about how many thunderstorms in the south-east and East Anglia, but the risk is there. The rate -- the greater risk is for Wales, later on Northern Ireland and Scotland.

A small risk the thunderstorms could push into south-east England. Cool and fresh, 18-24 degrees. That’s it from us. Now on BBC One it’s time for the news where you are. But first we’ll leave you with some of the images of today’s tribute to the 38 people who lost their lives in the Tunisia terror attack exactly a week ago. Welcome to BBC London News with me Victoria Hollins. The Head of the charity Kids Company, Camila Batmanghelidjh is to stand down, following controversy over the way it is run. Kids Company helps thousands of disadvantaged and vulnerable children and their families across London. But concerns have been raised in Whitehall- and the BBC has learnt that £3 million is being withheld from the charity, until there is a change to management. Miss Batmanghelidh has accused politicians of trying to discredit her. jean Mackenzie reports. The rich, famous and powerful have all enjoyed a tour of Kids Company over the years.

Donors include Richard Branson, jK wrote mine and Coldplay. But political sport has faltered in concerns over how the charity is run. journalists investigating it have uncovered some unusual practices. I spoke to former clients who told me that they would regularly receive cash in envelopes. These are vulnerable people who had given in some cases large sums of money and allowed to go and spend it on whatever they want to encourage them to keep attending the charity seemingly. Last year the government gave Kids Company £4 million, one fifth of its funding but this year it is holding ",,

Also tonight: Sweet as, sweet as. .. The shooting of Azelle Rodney - a police officer is cleared of his murder, ten years after his death. A prisoner custody officer has died after she was attacked outside a court in London earlier this week. Could World Heritage status be a first for the Forth? And Britain’s Heather Watson takes on the might of Serena Williams. Tonight on BBC London. A gang is convicted of smash and grab raids in which they stole hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of Rolex watches. And the founder of a high profile children’s charity is to stand down following allegations of mismanagement. Good evening and welcome to the Six 0’Clock News. A minute’s silence has been observed across the UK to remember the 38 people, 30 of them British, who were killed in the beach attack in Tunisia a week ago. The Queen and the Prime Minister, David Cameron, marked the silence, along with the families of the bereaved. The bodies of more victims arrived back in Britain this afternoon. Fergal Keane has this report. It was to be a silence that spoke for millions. A collective space to gather in a nation’s grief. BIG BEN CHIMES Not with rage, or calls for revenge, but with quiet, communities across Britain remembered. Like in Walsall, where three local football fans were among the dead. Adrian Evans, his father, Patrick, and his 19-year-old nephew, joel Richards. It is quite eerie. With colleagues I spoke to, who worked with Adrian, they were still walking around not believing what has gone on. In Glasgow, Elaine and Alison McKenzie remembered the dead and said they were lucky to be home. They were in the hotel next to the attack. And in Blackpool, another couple who had beenin Blackpool, another couple who had been in Sousse, in a hotel mark far from the massacre. Another kilometre UP from the massacre. Another kilometre up the beach and it could have been asked. But it wasn’t. You just feel for all the families. All who were involved. This is the headquarters of the travel group in Luton which organised the holidays of the dead. And in London, at the Tunisian embassy, an expression of solidarity with Britain from those with roots in both countries. I heard an appeal for British visitors to keep faith with Tunisia. Tunisia is in need of your presence in our country. If you don’t go, terror will win. These people want to terrorise us, they want to make us afraid, they want fear. Let’s turn this into of, hope and courage. In the late afternoon, from Tunisia came some of the last returning dead. Christopher and Sharon Bell, Scott Chalkley and his partner, Sue Davey. Ray and Angie Fisher. Eileen Swannack and her partner, john Welch. They are going to grieving families in Leeds, Derby, Leicester, Wiltshire, InterCity and country, into memory. -- into city and country. In Tunisia, a minute’s silence was also held on the beach in Sousse. Tunisians joined their Prime Minister, foreign dignitaries, and tourists, many of them British, in a ceremony that was timed to coincide with the silence in Britain. Let’sjoin Orla Guerin now in Sousse. Well, officials, holiday- makers, hotel staff Well, officials, holiday-makers, hotel staff and local people gathered here today at the sight of the massacre on the beach. One week on, many questions remain, chiefly, how could a lone gunman takes so many lives before the security forces stepped in? Tunisian’s Prime Minister told the BBC today he believes that police were slow to respond. Forthe believes that police were slow to respond. For the families of the bereaved, that will add to the torment. Coming to order the many Britons who lost their lives on this foreign shore. -- coming to honour the many Britons. Some who stood in tribute were on the beach at seven days ago, when tourists became targets, where no mercy was shown. Diane from Telford brought a flower and a poem and gave thanks for being alive. We were only over there, near the shop. We were coming to the beach. My daughter was eating her ice cream very slow. Had she have not eaten ice cream, we would have been dead, too, because we would be on the beach. Security was tightened just before officials arrived, and faded away soon afterwards, in spite of promises from the authorities. Then the bugle sounded the last post. Looking on, Britain’s ambassador and Tunisia’s Prime Minister. Britons and Tunisians were united today in sorrow and in defiance of extremists. Local staff saved many lives but are now finding themselves jobless. People are paying their respects to the dead on the sands where they fell. This beach is a place of mourning. Sousse has become a byword for terror, a reminder of what a lone attacker can do, and for many, the horror of what happened here is still very raw. And still impossible to understand. At some Britons have stayed on here, in spite of their trauma. We are so sorry for the people that have come here for a holiday. It chokes you up. We go home on Sunday, and we just wanted to pay our respects. We saved all year for our holiday and we thought, well, if we go, we have let them win. And why let them win? Mixed with the grief here, there is anger and resolve. The Prime Minister has said the battle against Islamic extremists is the struggle of our generation. Those who died on the sun loungers here may not be the last. A police marksman who shot and killed a suspected armed robber ten years ago has been cleared of his murder today at the Old Bailey. Anthony Long fired six fatal shots at 24-year-old Azelle Rodney, who was in the back of a car stopped by police in north London. Mr Long had denied murder, saying he was sure that he and his colleagues were in imminent danger. But two years ago a judge-led inquiry concluded that the shooting was not legallyjustified, a finding kept from the jury. june Kelly reports. Inside a police combo in pursuit of a criminal gang believed to be heavily armed and on their way to rob Colombian drugs dealers. -- a police convoy. There was a command for the team to carry out a hard stop on the gang’s car. And then one officer opened fire. Eight bullets in all. This is the man who was shot and killed, 24-year-old Azelle Rodney. Six bullets hit him in the head and body. Anthony Long, who fired the fatal shots, said he believed that Azelle Rodney was reaching for a weapon. Today the marksman, now retired, was cleared of murder by the jury, in a majority verdict. The shooting happened outside this pub. Injust over two microseconds, Anthony Long pulled the trigger eight times. He said he fired because he believed Azelle Rodney was posing an imminent threat to his fellow officers. The dead man’s mother, Susan Alexander, fought for a public enquiry into his death. It took seven years for that happen. The enquiry concluded that the shooting of Azelle Rodney was notjustified. The jury in this criminal case was not told about that. Azelle Rodney’s mother says she is very disappointed by today’s verdict. They could have stopped that car, apprehended them if they thought they were doing something, or they could prove they were doing something. Theirjob is to stop and apprehend. This was an officer who had opened fire before. In 1985 he was involved in the rescue of a young girl, following a siege in which a knifeman had murdered the child’s mother. Anthony Long shot and wounded the killer and carried the four-year-old to safety. One of his fellow officers here was Tony Gray. They worked together on hundreds of operations. I would say that hisjudgment would hundreds of operations. I would say that his judgment would be very good, if not better than most. And I would happily rely on hisjudgment at any time I was on the job. would happily rely on hisjudgment at any time I was on thejob. In 1987, Anthony Long shot dead two armed robbers and wounded a third during a police ambush. This was how he was described on one front page, a reference to a 1980s TV show. Tonight, in a statement on the Azelle Rodney shooting, he said he had to make a split-second life or death decision. The founder of a leading children’s charity is stepping down, after claims that it’s been badly run. Camilla Batmanghelidjh will cease to be the chief executive of Kids Company after the Government said it would withhold a £3 million grant if she didn’t go. She said claims the charity was mismanaged were a ""red herring"" to distract from Government policy failings on child protection. The former celebrity publicist Max Clifford has been charged with indecent assault, relating to an alleged incident in 1981. Clifford was arrested at Littlehey Prison in Cambridgeshire in March, as part of Operation Yewtree. He will appear at Westminster Magistrates Court on july 21st. A prisoner custody officer, who was attacked while on duty outside a court in central London on Monday, has died. Lorraine Barwell was 54 and a mother of two. She’s the first prison custody officer to die in the line of duty. Tom Symonds reports. She did a toughjob, at the sharp end of the criminaljustice system. She was experienced and popular, but Lorraine Barwell has become the first custody officer to die in the line of duty. She worked for the private contractor Serco, responsible for ferrying prisoners to their courts. I speak for all my colleagues when we say that we are shocked, horrified and deeply saddened by what has happened, and our feelings go out to the family at this terrible time. It happened at Blackfriars Crown Court, where prison vans enter and leave through these doors. Inside, on Monday, Lorraine Barwell was transferring a prisoner from a court to one of those vans. She was working with other custody officers, male and female, but she was suddenly attacked. She was left critically ill and, this morning, police were told that she had died after her family agreed that life support could be withdrawn. Serco has promised a forensic investigation, but the company has stressed... There were the correct number of people dealing with this man in the escort suite, so it was notjust Lorraine by herself, she was accompanied by other experienced officers. At the depot where she worked, Lorraine Barwell’s colleagues described her as a ‘lovely lady who loved herjob’. They said they had been told not to give interviews. A 22-year-old man, Humphrey Burke, has been charged with conflicting grievous bodily harm. The police investigation continues.

And ahead of the British Grand Prix, jenson Button tells us why he hopes things can only get better for his team McLaren. One of Scotland’s best-known landmarks is being considered for world Heritage status. It’s one of Scotland’s greatest landmarks, but could the Forth Rail Bridge gain the ultimate official recognition as a World Heritage site? A United Nations Committee is expected to make the decision over the weekend. If it does win, it would put the bridge on a par with the Great Wall of China and the Barrier Reef, as Lorna Gordon reports. For 125 years, this monument to Victorian engineering has spanned these waters. Still much in use, the Forth Rail Bridge is a masterpiece, balancing elegance and strength. Much admired and much visited, it could soon be adding another accolade to its name. I think it’s amazing, yeah. My dad worked for the railways in New Zealand, he would love it. World Heritage status, a must-see destination? For me, it is, yeah. I think it should be, yeah. It’s so beautiful. Those tourists may one day get to scale its heights. It’s a thing of beauty. It’s got lovely dimensions... It’s quite a journey. Ian Hay has made it many times. He’s worked on the bridge for 20 years and believes World Heritage status would be well deserved and significant. I think where it lands in the history of engineering puts it in a very special place. From a Scottish point of view, I think it’s our greatest landmark. Certainly of our -- certainly of its type. It lies close to all our hearts, I think, in Scotland. The views from the top stretch for miles, but look towards the water and you see instead the intricate latticework of girders that took seven years to complete. From this unique vantage point at the top of the Forth Rail Bridge, you really get a sense of just how special this actually is. It was the first bridge of its kind in the world and its rigid, red steel structure has become an iconic image of Scotland. Locals support the bid, but urge caution in dealing with the extra visitors the area might now receive. I welcome it. I think it should, I think it should get World Heritage status. I think obviously, if somebody lives here, we’ll be looking at the quality of the management, traffic management, parking, all that sort of thing. We’re already pretty full of people in cars in this place, so it has to be managed carefully. The Forth Rail Bridge is a triumph of engineering. This much-loved landmark may now be about to gain recognition on the global stage. Lorna Gordon, BBC News, South Queensferry. With just two days to go before Greece’s crucial bailout referendum, the Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, has again urged people to vote no and to reject what he called ""blackmail"". Voters will have to decide on Sunday whether they support the terms of further international loans, which will involve more tax rises and spending cuts for Greece. EU leaders have warned that a ""No"" vote could see Greece leave the Eurozone. Our Europe Editor, Katya Adler, has been speaking to voters, ahead of the referendum. In these stormy times in Greece, Yanis says hisjob gives some peace of mind. Diving daily under these cool waters to keep the nets of this fish farm intact. Yanis worries about the future of his family, he tells me, but also about the reputation of his country. We hear in the news about the Greek people. They don’t care about the European, they don’t care about tomorrow, they don’t care about nothing. It is not like that. We care. The nearby port town here is an example of the unhappy state this country is in. Youth unemployment is high, expectations of a better future low. But this Sunday could change all that, with the referendum called by the government asking Greeks to vote yes or no to more austerity. Many Greeks feel ground down by their economic difficulties, but ahead of Sunday’s referendum, there is a creeping sense of excitement. After years of austerity imposed on Greece, people said they feel finally there is a choice in what happens next, although no-one expects overnight miracles, whatever the outcome of the vote. Everyone we come across here has a vocal opinion of how Greece should vote this weekend. This man told me they’re split. The old people here have not got any courage to vote against EU demands for more economic pain in Greece, he told me, but his friends who are all unemployed had nothing to lose. We won’t be slaves to Germany and the Eurozone, he said. This man has been running tavernas for 30 years and he keeps the news on all the time at the moment, he tells me, he believes this is a really important time for Greece. Life is a struggle. All the businesses are suffering. Voting this week is important not just for me, but for the future of my grandchildren. How are we are going to live if it doesn’t get any better? Those lucky enough to live by Greece’s watery shores should enjoy the calm while they can. The vote this weekend could send shockwaves through their country and beyond. The rest of Europe is watching. A solar- powered plane attempting to fly round the globe without a drop of fuel has landed in Hawaii after a record-breaking flight across the Pacific. The aircraft, Solar Impulse, touched down after a flight of more than 117 hours from japan, smashing the previous record of 76 hours’ flying time. A court case in Miami has taken an unusual turn for the man in the dock. Did you go to Nautilus, for middle school? Oh, my goodness! I’m sorry to see you there. I always wondered what happened to you, sir. This is the nicest kid in middle school. Oh, my goodness. The judge recognised defendant Arthur Booth as a school friend. Booth broke down as he realised how he’d fallen from grace with a life of petty crime and drug misuse. I hope you’re able to change your ways. Despite the judge’s sympathy, Booth remains behind bars following the bail hearing. What’s sad is how old we’ve become. Oh, my goodness! It’s been another great day for tennis, with the sun shining on Wimbledon. Heather Watson has been taking on the mighty Serena Watson -- Serena Williams on Centre Court. They seven -- they say never to meet your idols, how about trying to be done? HeatherWatson your idols, how about trying to be done? Heather Watson as a child had a post of Serena Williams and now she was there across the net, and the early signs were not encouraging. Williams quickly broke serve but it was not one-way traffic. A 23, the potential of Heather Watson was no secret and she was proving she could slug it out with the best. But Williams remember has won a 20 grand slams and she powered to the first set 6-2. All over? No way! Watson raised her game and she broke the Williams serve. For the thousands of home fans, time to get excited. But soon, they were silenced, as Williams responded by breaking back. The world number one was determined as ever. And the very latest is that Heather Watson is 5-A in front in the second set. She is serving for that second set. It would be an extraordinary turnaround if she can manage it. It is a gutsy display from Heather Watson. As you can see from these live pictures. What a result if she can beat Serena Williams, the top seed. HeatherWatson can beat Serena Williams, the top seed. Heather Watson has never been into the last 16 before but the fans keeping their fingers crossed. Elsewhere, a good day for the big names with straight set wins for both Novak Djokovic and Maria Sharapova. Back to you. Very exciting, thank you! It’s almost a decade since four bombs exploded on London’s transport system on 7th july 2005. 52 people were killed and more than 700 injured. Over the next few days, we’ll be hearing from some of those caught up in that terrible attack. We begin with Sajda Mughal, from North London. Sajda was on the Piccadilly Line train between King’s Cross and Russell Square when the bomb went off. While Sajda is still emotionally scarred by the day’s events, 7/7 also helped her change her life for the better. It was ten seconds into the tunnel, going towards Russell Square, when there was a massive, loud explosion. People started to bang onto the windows and banging on the doors. I thought we were going to die, and that’s when I started to prepare myself for death. In the sense of, I was thinking, I haven’t said bye to my loved ones, I haven’t got married, I haven’t had children. What we all started to hear were distant cries saying, it’s the police, we’re coming to get you! It was a sense of relief. But I remember, also, it being chaotic. Crowds gathering, people staring. News later started to break that they were bombs carried out by a small handful of Muslim males, and that shocked me even more, being a Muslim myself. And actually, Islam does not stand for what happened on 7/7. And that’s when I decided, well, actually, something needs to change and I want to make that difference. In 2008, I quit myjob in the private sector to work here, injAN Trust, working with those who are at risk of radicalisation or working with those who have been radicalised. But also, working with Muslim mothers so that they can safeguard their children. On our website, we’ve got our web guardians here... Ultimately, 7/7 completely changed my life. And when I look back ten years ago, everyone came together to help each other. And that’s exactly what we need to do, come together so that we can overcome these issues of radicalisation and Islamophobia. Sajda Mughal, remembering the events of the 7/7 attacks of 2005. And on the News at Ten, we will hear from a father of one of the victims. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Nick Miller. A very pleasant evening.

Thunderstorms breaking out across the son of-- across the South, but notice how the area of stormy weather expands across parts of Wales, the Midlands, Northern England and it may move quickly through Northern Ireland, reaching Southern Scotland later in the worst will tend to go through when most of us will be safely at home but out and about, it is difficult travelling and sleep may be disturbed by the thunder and the fact it is a warm and muggy night, paired with last night, although Northern Scotland, temperatures around ten, 12 degrees -- compared with. Still wet weather across the North tomorrow, rain still heading North across Scotland. Still some of that in the far North into the afternoon. Improvements elsewhere, a late today shower in Northern Ireland and an early thunderstorm in the far South East of England but a lot of fine weather in the afternoon. Very warm and humid across eastern so we feel the heat again at Wimbledon. On Sunday, it is cooler and fresher, still warm when the Sun makes an appearance but some showers from West to East across the UK. The potential for heavy showers but many places stay dry. We cannot rule out something at the Grand Prix at Silverstone and you notice temperatures for most around 20 Celsius. The immediate focus is on storms tonight.

A gang is convicted of a series of smash and grab raids in which they stole hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of Rolex watches. It was very difficult because they were unpredictable, we never knew when they were going to commit the offences. And the means that they used are very dangerous, they used axes and sledgehammers to steal the goods. The ringleader handled luxury goods stolen in other robberies too, including a million pound raid on Selfridges. Also tonight...

A gang have been convicted of a series of smash and grab robberies across London over the last seven years. In one attack, the men were armed with sledgehammers and an axe, and stole hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of Rolex watches before making off on mopeds. Police say the ringleader also handled high-value goods sold in another robberies, including a £1 million raid on Selfridge’s. Alice Bha nd hu kravi reports. Armed robbers dressed in burkas. This audacious attack in Selfridge’s took place in broad daylight. The thieves made off with luxury watches worth more than £1 million. Some of those watches made their way into the hands of this man, Rhys Dunford, from Walford Abbey in Essex. He made a name for himself handling goods stolen by armed gangs on mopeds. This was one of the shops targeted, jimmy Choo, here in the middle of the West End. ",,

A gang is convicted of a series of smash-and-grab raids in which they stole hundreds of thousands of pounds of watches. Good evening. A minute’s silence has been observed across the UK to remember the 38 people, 30 of them British, who were killed in the beach attack in Tunisia a week ago. The Queen marked the silence, along with the families of the dead. The bodies of more victims arrived back in Britain this afternoon. Our special correspondent, Fergal Keane, has this report. It was to be a silence that spoke for millions. A collective space to gather in the nation’s grief. BELLS TOLLING. Not with rage or calls for revenge, but with quiet, communities across Britain remembered. Like in Walsall where three local football fans were among the dead. Adrian Evans, his 78-year-old father Patrick and 19-year-old nephew joel Richards. It was quite eerie. With colleagues I spoke to who worked with Adrian, they were still walking around not believing what had gone on. In Glasgow, Elaine and Alison MacKenzie remembered the dead and said they were lucky to be home. They were in the hotel next to the attack. In Blackpool, another couple who had been in Sousse, in a hotel not far from the massacre. Another kilometre along the beach and it could have been us. But it wasn’t. You just feel for all the familie who were involved. This was the scene at the headquarters of the travel group in Luton which organised the holidays of the dead. And in London, at the Tunisian embassy, an expression of solidarity with Britain from those with roots in both countries. I heard an appeal for British visitors to keep faith with Tunisia. Tunisia is in need of your presence in our country. If you do not go, terror will win. These people want to terrorise us and make us afraid, they want the fear. Let’s turn this into love, hope and courage. In the late afternoon, from Tunisia, came some of the last returning dead. Christopher and Sharon Bell, Scott Chalkley and his partner Sue Davey. Ray and Angie Fisher. Eileen Swannack and her partner, john Welch. They are going to grieving families in Leeds, Derby, Leicester, Wiltshire, into city and country, into memory. In Tunisia, a minute’s silence was also held on the beach in Sousse with local people joining dignitaries and tourists in the ceremony. The country’s Prime Minister said today that the gunman, Seifeddine Rezgui, had at the end of last year travelled to Libya, where self-styled Islamic State has a stronghold. Our correspondent orla Guerin reports now on today’s events and on the challenges facing Tunisia and its people in the aftermath of the attack. Coming to honour the many Britons who lost their lives on this foreign shore. Some who stood in tribute were on the beach seven days ago when tourists became targets, where no mercy was shown. Security was tightened just before officials arrived and faded away soon afterwards, in spite of promises from the authorities. Shortly before noon, the Last Post was played. Looking on, Britain ‘s ambassador and Tunisia’s Prime Minister. Soon afterwards, as Britons and Tunisians were united in grief, the Prime Minister admitted the security forces were at fault. The problem with what happened in Sousse is that the time of reaction. This is the problem. He said the police were too slow. They were. They were. Of course, they were. People are paying their respects to the dead on the sands where they fell. This beach is a place of mourning. Sousse has become a by-word for terror. A reminder of what a lone attacker can do and for many, the horror of what happened here is still very raw. And still impossible to understand, but some Britons have stayed on here, in spite of their trauma. We are so sorry for the people who have come here for a holiday... It chokes you up. And, you know, we go home on Sunday and wejust wanted And, you know, we go home on Sunday and we just wanted to pay our respects. We saved all year for our holiday and we thought, well, if we go we have let them win and why let them win? Some Tunisians are worried the extremists will win through recruiting young men forjihad, allegedly in mosques like this one in a nearby town. This man told us his son was radicalised at the mosque before joining Islamic State in Syria, two years ago. This is the last photo taken of Mohammed, then 17. His parents say he was a top student before joining the exodus to the battlefields in Syria, Libya and Iraq, which have attracted an estimated 3,000 Tunisians. TRANSLATION: I blame the Government because they didn’t do anything to bring back our kids. They didn’t do anything to stop these people brain-washing our children. I want mY brain-washing our children. I want my son to come back, but the way he was before. Back at the beach, they mourn for the many victims of another young Tunisian who was trained by Islamic State in Libya and came home a mass killer. A jury has found a police marksman not guilty of murdering a suspected armed robber ten years ago. Anthony Long shot 2lI-year-old Azelle Rodney at close range in north London. He said he’d acted in self defence. But two years ago, a judge-led inquiry concluded that the shooting was not legallyjustified - a finding kept from the jury. Our Home Affairs Correspondent june Kelly reports. Inside a police convoy, in pursuit of a criminal gang, believed to be heavily armed and on their way to rob Columbian drug dealers. That was the command for the team to carry out a hard stop on the gang’s car. And then one officer opened fire. Sweet as. .. Eight bullets in all. This is the man who was shot and killed, 2lI-year-old Azelle Rodney. Six bullets hit him in the head and body. Anthony Long, the officer who fired the fatal shots, said he believed Azelle Rodney was reaching for a weapon. Today, the marksman, now retired, was cleared of murder by the jury. The shooting happened right outside this pub. Injust over two seconds, Anthony Long pulled the trigger eight times. He said he fired because he believed Azelle Rodney was posing an imminent threat to his fellow officers. The dead man’s mother, Susan Alexander, fought for a public inquiry into his death. That happened in 2012. And it concluded that the shooting of Azelle Rodney was not justified. The jury in this criminal case wasn’t told about that. Susan Alexander said she’s very disappointed by today’s court verdict. They could have stopped that car, just apprehended them if they thought they were doing something or they could prove they were doing something, then stop them, arrest them. Theirjob is to stop and apprehend. This was an officer who had open fired before. In 1985, he was involved in the rescue of a young girl following a siege in which a knifeman had murdered the child’s mother. Anthony Long shot and wounded the killer and carried the four-year-old to safety. One of his fellow officers here was Tony Gray. They worked together on hundreds of operations. I would say that his judgment would be very good, if not better than most. And I would happily rely on his judgment at any time I was on thejob. In 1987, Anthony Long shot dead two armed robbers and wounded a third during a police ambush. This was how he was described on one front-page - a reference to an ‘80s TV show. Tonight, in a statement on the Azelle Rodney shooting, he said he had to make a split-second life or death decision. With just two days to go before Greece’s crucial bailout referendum, the Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras this evening held a rally - urging voters to reject the bailout proposals put forward by the country’s creditors. Voters will have to decide on Sunday whether they support the terms of further international loans, which will involve more tax rises and spending cuts for Greece. EU leaders have warned that a ""No"" vote could see Greece leave the Eurozone. Our Europe Editor Katya Adler is in Athens for us. Well, there is a sense of nervous anticipation here ahead of Sunday’s referendum. As you say, there is so much riding on it. For Greeks, of course, this is about their families, their businesses and their bank accounts, but adding to a sense of tension is the fact they know all of Europe is watching with this vote seen as key, notjust of Europe is watching with this vote seen as key, not just for Greece, but for the eurozone as a whole. Greece is not a country known for orderly queues. But Athens central bus station was calm, although crowded, as people jostled aboard buses bound for home towns across Greece, where they are registered to vote in Sunday’s referendum. I have to do it. I have to vote to make the future for my country, for Europe. With so much at stake, these are stormy times in Greece. This man says hisjob is a welcome escape, diving daily under shimmering glassy waters to keep the nets of this fish farm in tact. He worries about the future of his family, he tells me, but also about the reputation of his country. We hear in the news about the Greek people, these are lazy guys, they don’t care about Europe, they don’t care about tomorrow, they don’t care about nothing. It’s not like that. We care. This nearby port town is a sad example of the state this country is in. Youth unemployment is high here. Expectations of a better future, low. But this Sunday could change all that. Many Greeks feel ground down by their economic difficulties, but ahead of Sunday’s referendum there is a creeping sense of excitement. After years of austerity imposed on Greece, people say they feel finally they have a voice and a choice in what happens next. Although no-one expects overnight miracles, whatever the outcome of the vote. Everyone we met here had a strong opinion about the referendum. Old people here lack the courage to vote no to more economic pain imposed by the EU, he told me. But his friends, all unemployed, had nothing to lose. We won’t be slaves to Germany and the eurozone, he said. With emotions running high here, police fire tear gas at a group of violent troublemakers back in Athens, shortly before mass rallies for the yes and ""no"" vote. Prime Minister Tsipras was greeted like a rock star when he arrived on stage. This is the biggest gamble of his career, it will make or break it, deeply affecting the future of his country. Haunting people here is the fear of riots breaking out in Athens, as they did two years ago. The skirmishes in my report were just that, but the fact that they broke out and police tried to stop them with tear gas left a bad taste in everyone’s mouth. Greece really is divided ahead of Sunday’s vote, with arguments splitting friends and families, as they did in Scotland ahead of the referendum on independence. But, as one Greek mother put it to me, she said there is too much focus on referendum day. We all need to live together the day after. A prison custody officer who was attacked while on duty outside a court in central London on Monday has died. Lorraine Barwell was 54 and a mother of two. She’s the first prison custody officer to die in the line of duty. The former celebrity publicist Max Clifford has been charged with indecent assault, relating to an alleged incident in 1981. Clifford was arrested at Littlehey Prison in Cambridgeshire in March, as part of Operation Yewtree. He will appear at Westminster Magistrates Court later this month. The founder of a leading children’s charity is stepping down, after claims that it’s been badly run. Camilla Batmanghelidjh will cease to be the Chief Executive of Kids Company, after the Government said it would withhold a £3 million grant if she didn’t go. She said claims the charity was mismanaged were a distraction from Government policy failings on child protection. A court case in Miami has taken an unusual turn for the man in the dock. Did you go to Nautilus, for middle school? Oh, my goodness! I’m sorry to see you there. I always wondered what happened to you, sir. This is the nicest kid in middle school. Oh, my goodness. The judge recognised defendant Arthur Booth as a school friend. Booth broke down as he realised how he’d fallen from grace, with a life of petty crime and drug misuse. I hope you’re able to change your ways. Despite the judge’s sympathy, Booth remains behind bars following the bail hearing. What’s sad is how old we’ve become. Oh, my goodness! Shares in China’s stock markets have been falling sharply, despite efforts by its government to restore confidence. The markets have slumped by almost a third since the middle ofjune, wiping more than a trillion pounds off share values. Many of the losers are small investors, who have come to expect ever-rising returns, as Carrie Gracie reports. Shanghai, home to China’s stock market, where what went up was never quite expected to come down, and first-time investors poured in to hunt big rewards. Prices surged over the year tojune but in the past three weeks they’ve lost £1.6 trillion. Inexperienced investors, with no time to assess the companies they were buying, and no reservations about slowing economic growth. This bubble was always going to burst. As markets closed for the weekend, there was resignation among investors on the streets of Beijing. TRANSLATION: I don’t want to look at the price of my shares. I haven’t looked for days. It’s all bad news. TRANSLATION: All the money I’ve made, I’ve now lost. I’m back where I started. TRANSLATION: The market is a bubble and it’s bursting. We are heading to the bottom and dropping fast. 90 million Chinese investors have gambled on the belief that a government which still controls many aspects of the economy wants to see, and can guarantee, even, a flourishing stock market. And over the past week, Beijing has tried to restore confidence, but it hasn’t worked. The long-term impacts could delay the opening of China’s financial markets. And also, in some degree, will reduce people’s confidence in the government’s control of the economy and the financial system. The government wants small investors like this to pour their savings into the stock market. But it’s uncomfortable when it can’t control the narrative. Already nearly 100 million Chinese citizens have a stake in these numbers going up, and that’s a lot of angry people if they continue to go down. Carrie Gracie, BBC News, Beijing. Wimbledon served up one of the all-time great women’s matches this evening when Britain’s Heather Watson came within a whisker of beating the number one seed, Serena Williams. Andy Swiss was watching the action on Centre Court. Andy, this was some match. It was an incredible match. I think few people expected Heather Watson to have any realistic chance against the woman who has won 20 grand slams, but she was just one game away from beating her. The end result, though, was heartbreak. From hope. To delerioum. To despair. The faces ultimately told the story of what might have been. As an eight-year-old, Heather Watson had a As an eight-year-old, Heather Watson had a poster of Serena Williams on her bedroom wall. Now, she was across the net. The top seed powered to the first set. All over, surely. But Watson, the world number 59, suddenly found the form of her life. One set all, Wimbledon going wild. Out on the hill, they were transfixed, as Watson dominated the decider. Soon, she was serving for the match. And working the crowd into a frenzy. But in the nick of time, Williams reeled off three games in a row. Watson had pushed her to the brink, but the dream was dashed. So near and yet so agonisingly far. The fans have been through every emotion over the last few hours, but they are rising to applaud Heather Watson and the gutsiest of displays. Coming off the court, I was gutted. I felt was so close from the biggest win of my career on the biggest court. And to do that at home in front of the crowd, that was just amazing today. Amazing, indeed. Thrilling, enthralling. But for Watson tonight, that may be of little consolation. Andy Swiss, BBC News, Wimbledon. The England defender Laura Bassett has given her first broadcast interview to the BBC since her own goal helped to eliminate the women’s team from the football World Cup. They were knocked out by the holders, japan, in the semifinals, but it was still the furthest the women’s team has ever reached in the tournament. Katie Gornall reports. It was the moment that brought England’s World Cup dream to a crushing conclusion and one that captured the nation’s sympathy. England’s semifinal seemed destined to go to extra time until Laura Bassett found herself at the centre of one of the most heartbreaking defeats in football. For those people that know me, some people call me a swinging brick, and that I lacked emotion. Mine times out of ten, I agree. But something took over me, where I was out of control. I just wanted to get off there and cry and be on my own. The healing process continues for Laura Bassett, but at England’s team hotel she has been forced to turn her attention elsewhere as the squad prepare for their third-place play-off with Germany. It is a match she is expected to play in, underlining not only her worth to the team but also her strength of character. Bassett’s performances have character. Bassett’s performances have seen her become a central figure in Canada, putting her body on the line to help the team through some of its toughest challenges. Now the team is hoping her. I have to say a big thank you to my team-mates. We have, a long journey. Our squad isn’tjust team-mates. We have, a long journey. Our squad isn’t just together. Our squad isn’tjust together. The togetherness and the team spirit has not happened overnight. It has been a long journey for all of us. It is overwhelming. Like I say, I would change it in a heartbeat if I could. England’s emotionaljourney through England’s emotional journey through Canada England’s emotionaljourney through Canada is not over yet. Tomorrow, they play European champions, Germany, in a play-off for third place. Victory would be historic and perhaps some solace. It’s almost a decade since four bombs exploded on London’s transport system on 7thjuly, 2005. 52 people were killed and more than 700 injured. Over the next few days we’ll be hearing from some of those caught up in that terrible attack. Tonight it’s the turn ofjohn Taylor from Billericay. john’s 2lI-year-old daughter, Carrie, died when the bomb went off on the Tube train heading to Aldgate station. As john explains, ten years later, Carrie’s memory lives on. I’d got up late that morning, basically, and I didn’t have the chance to see Carrie or her mum leave for work. It was just a normal day for them. They travelled up from Billericay to Liverpool Street. Carrie and june got off at Liverpool Street, said goodbye to one another. june turned left and went one way, Carrie turned right and went the other way, and that was the last we saw of Carrie. After I realised there was something drastically wrong, I started to ring Carrie’s mobile. Phone calls, I don’t know how many phone calls we made on that day. We must have made dozens and dozens of phone calls between one another. It wasn’t until about ten days after the events our two family liaison officers came back to us they broke the news to us. It wasjust like a brick hit me in the face, really, the realisation that she wasn’t there any more. She’d died in an attack that killed 52 people. And it was just like living in a black hole from then on. Carrie was a very bubbly person. She was the light of our life, of course she was. On the 6th ofjuly, the day before the events had happened, I was redecorating our kitchen. And she was absolutely bouncing off the walls, she was so pleased ",,

That’s the recommendation of the long-awaited report into airport expansion in the south-east of England. The report said a third runway should come with severe restrictions - including a ban on night flights and limits on noise. It’s now up to the government to accept or reject the proposal. Let’s cross to Heathrow and our transport correspondent Richard Westcott. In the whole process to pick around Lake, if it were a long haul flight we probably would have just taken off, there is a long way to go. First of all politicians have got to decide on that one happen until the end of the year then we are talking about ten years to go through the planning processes, to build the thing and then go through the legal challenges. In other words, we’ve just started but there is plenty of distance to go yet. Britain’s biggest and busiest airport should be even bigger. A three-year study into all of the options has recommended a new third runway at Heathrow. We believe we’ve got reasonable solutions that won’t please everybody, but we’ve set a new balance between the needs of the economy as a whole and the interests of local communities. What he means is he wants Heathrow to be a better neighbour to those living nearby. That would mean no more flights before 6am in the morning. It would mean an absolute guarantee that there will never be a fourth runway at Heathrow. It will mean legal limits on the amount of noise and on local air pollution as well. And it would mean airlines having to help fund things like double glazing to keep that noise out, but that could put money on the price of the ticket. So, first blood goes to Heathrow. That fight was child’s play compared to the next, convincing politicians it’s the right idea. If you look at the politics this runway is still undeliverable, isn’t it? In the Prime Minister came out against it five years ago. The Prime Minister showed great political leadership setting of the Airports Commission with cross-party support three years ago. We’ve changed our plans to meet his needs, we have you turned so the Prime Minister does not have too. In the end it has come down to money. Heathrow would make more for Britain than Gatwick. The report says that an extra runway would add an extra £1li7 billion to the economy over the 60 next years, atjobs £1li7 billion to the economy over the 60 next years, at jobs and add Ao new destinations, although only a dozen of those would be long haul. But, Gatwick isn’t finished yet. Although the report says the economic benefits would be considerably smaller, it says it is still feasible giving the government a get out if it can’t agree on Heathrow. Gatwick Airport is still very much in this race and as we look forward we see the next important milestone is the next government decision. Ultimately it is the government that will decide which airport gets the additional runway and because we have the strong distaste, we are the fastest of the liver and the cleanest and quietest we remain of the view that when the government decides later this year will back at Wick. For all the business benefit, ordinary people would still lose their homes -- Gatwick. A big chunk of the village of Harmondsworth would be wiped off the map. It would be an act of barbarism, of unparalleled proportions at this time. It’s also going to destroy an awful lot of lives. These people are never going to find work again if they move on, where will they move to? So the recommendation is in, now it is over to the politicians. Richard Westcott, BBC News, Heathrow. Asa As a plane lands behind me the committee has now picked Heathrow. But this is by no means a done deal. We can expect plenty of rows in the months ahead. Thanks very much, Richard. Well, opponents of a third runway say they won’t give up the fight. And London’s mayor, Borisjohnson - who’s always opposed the plan - says he thinks it will ""never be built."" Here’s our political correspondent Robin Brant. There was a time when David Cameron was against a bigger Heathrow. No ifs, no buts, he said in 2009. A clear commitment. He delayed the final decision so the election could pass but now he has to make his mind up. His big problem is the people leading the fight against it are Tories, from his own side. Is this NIMBYs? No, says the mayor of London. He insists this is about more than just building in his own backyard. I just don’t think that you can do this kind of thing in 21st-century western European society. Yes, maybe in some Communist regime in the 1950s, but this is too environmentally damaging. In a city with plenty of noise and pollution on the streets his concern is a bigger Heathrow means more of it in the skies above. The Tory MP who wants to be the next mayor said he will quit Parliament if it gets the go-ahead. I made a pledge years ago that I would trigger a by-election if my party gives the green light for expansion. The Prime Minister has problems at the heart of government as well. Here we are in Downing Street, overhear the Foreign Office, where the man in charge Philip Hammond is an MP near Heathrow and he doesn’t want it to get bigger. Next door, the Chancellor, George Osborne, does support it. He thinks it is good for the economy. In the middle, David Cameron, who has been against the idea of a third runway in the past. Is he about to change his mind? One thing is clear from Prime Minister’s Questions. He is not rushing into any final decision. I am clear about the legal position that if we say anything now before studying the report you can endanger whatever decision is made. The guarantee I can give is that a decision will be made by the end of the year. That gives the Prime Minister more time and room for manoeuvre. For Labour this is an issue of country over party. Can I ask the Prime Minister, will he stand up for Britain’s interests or will he be bullied by Boris? There was much talk of that long-term economic plan during the election. David Cameron needs to decide if expanding Heathrow is part of that. Knowing he will have to fight some on his own side along the way. Let’s speak to our assistant political Editor, Norman Smith. This report is finally out but it is politically fraught. It may be eight scorching day today but if I was David Cameron I would dominate tin helmet because ready much whatever he does he faces a bruising backlash. If he gives the go-ahead to Heathrow he faces a bust UP go-ahead to Heathrow he faces a bust up with some of the biggest beasts in his party, Borisjohnson, Zac Goldsmith, the man who would be Tory Mayor of London, some of the senior figures in his government. One of whom told me today that the Davis report was"" a steaming pile of beep"". If on the other hand he gives the go-ahead to Gatwick there are 20 Tory MPs determined to stop him and they already say that those Cabinet ministers opposed to Heathrow on constituency grounds should not be allowed a vote. On the other hand, if Mr Cameron goes for the third option, delaying this and booting it into the long grass, he faces a ferocious row with business who are screaming out for a decision after more than 50 years of prevarication. Now, at the moment Mr Cameron is circling over the Davis report. He’s in a holding pattern over Heathrow. He says he won’t say anything until December. But when he does finally decide to land, be it at Heathrow or Gatwick, he faces the most almighty political prank. Thanks, Norman.

Frantic efforts are being made to try to stop an exit by Greece from the Euro. Greece is reported this lunchtime to be making major concessions to its creditors - over pensions and VAT - which are due to be discussed by European finance ministers this afternoon. Yesterday the deadline expired for Greece to make its debt repayment to the International Monetary Fund. At the same time, its international bailout agreement also expired. Our economics correspondent Andy Verity reports. On his way to work this morning the Greek para list was preparing a climb-down, a letter published showing Greece now accepts most of the terms demanded by creditors when it broke off talks on the weekend. Addressing creditors at the Eurogroup, the IMF and European Central Bank, the letter says Athens will accept their proposed rear forms of VAT with just one amendment and on pensions with a request to bring them in slightly more slowly. -- proposed reforms. Even with those concessions it is not clear that creditors want to reach a deal and the head of the European Commission is not saying much. On in permanent contact with the Greeks and other authorities. Thank you. Time is running short. Eurozone finance Mr Zaw will meet this afternoon to discuss Greece’s latest offer. With a referendum set for Sunday the Germans especially don’t want to renegotiate before them. Looming over proceedings is a deadline to PPV over proceedings is a deadline to pay 3.5 billion euros in three weeks’ ‘time. TRANSLATION: We await the outcome of the referendum. Head of the referendum there cannot be any talks about a new bailout programme. And besides, this is impossible without a mandate from the German parliament. In Athens, pensioners who can’t get their hands on their pension money are exasperated with both sides. TRANSLATION: What can I do with 120 euros? What? Eat, pay my obligations? What? TRANSLATION: S everyday we are falling down and we have reached the point of waiting for people to get their pension, and what, not even a third of it. This morning the governor of the Bank of England said the risks to our own financial stability had worsened in recent days. The events in Greece have moved very quickly. At the time of its policy meeting the FPCjudged the associated risks were particularly acute and just before this report was finalised the Greek crisis intensified and Greek authorities imposed a bank holiday and capital controls. The situation remains fluid. Polls in Greece show growing support for a Yes vote if the referendum goes ahead on Sunday. The prospect of a last-minute deal pushed global markets up this morning. The euro, though, is no stronger than it was last night. Andy Verity, BBC News. Let’s get the latest from our business correspondent, joe Lynam, who’s in Athens. Are we any Are WE any ClOSâIâ sure we are. This apparent climb-down from Alexis Tsipras does not necessarily get the warm welcome in Eurozone Capitals. I’ve been speaking to finance ministries and the suggestion as they got to wait until the Greek people have spoken on Sunday before they can get talks back under way. They cannot accept something described as a humiliation I Alexis Tsipras last week, they can’t get those talks under way. Let me give you an anecdote about the mood music here and how on age people are. Everyone is listening to the radio and watching their phone and when the word came through of this new offer, the climb-down from Tsipras, people decided at a cafe where we were to order lunch. They were only going to have a copy or a soft drink but they decided to order lunch because they thought maybe the crisis is coming to an end and I can spend the extra 1+ euros, 5 euros, 6 euros on lunch that I otherwise wouldn’t have done. One final thought on the polls, a fairly new polling agency for a left wing paper, the good news for the yes side the gap is narrowing, the no side is on the way down. Still a lot to play for. Many thanks, joe Lynam. The bodies of some of the British tourists killed in last Friday’s attack in Tunisia - are being flown back to the UK this lunchtime. The Prime Minister said that 27 people from Britain are now known to have died and that number is likely to rise. Let’s cross to Ben Brown - who’s in the Tunisian resort of Sousse - where the attacks took place. Since the killings here there has been a mass exodus of more than 10,000 British tourists. All of the British wounded survivors of the attack have now been flown home and this afternoon the first of the British dead are being repatriated. The cortege arrived this morning at Tunis air base, bearing the confidence of eight Britishjurists. It has taken five days to confirm their identities and arrange their repatriations but finally the first of the dead are on their way back to the United Kingdom -- of the dead are on their way back to the United Kingdom -- coffins. There was a military salute from the British defence at Ashley here and the coffins are being flown home on an RAF Sea 17 transport plane, a three-hour flight to Brize Norton, the base near Oxford where the bodies of so many British soldiers killed in Iraq and Afghanistan have been repatriated in recent years. At the beach where many of the gunman’s victims died, representatives from Thomson, one of the holiday companies, left flowers and wrote messages for the dead. You did not deserve this, read on Tunisia did not deserve this. A local doctor who was amongst the first medics to arrive at the scene of the massacre said she is still traumatised by the horror of what she saw, as she tried to treat the casualties. TRANSLATION: When I sit by myself I review the previous scene over and over again. I remember everything. I can’t sleep any more. The first few days I couldn’t sleep at all so I took a couple of days off, and until today I couldn’t get out of the house because I was scared. Around RAF Brize Norton this afternoon flags are flying at half- mast. As a grieving nation prepares to receive the first of its dead. There will be many more coffins to follow in the coming days. There are suggestions today that the gunmen Seifeddine Rezgui had taken drugs before he went on the attack here at this beach resort. Traces of amphetamine have been found in his body during a post-modern might-- examination. Police are looking for two men who they believe could have been his accomplices and arrested seven others. In the last hour, a jury has acquitted the former editor of the News of the World, Neil Wallis, on charges of phone hacking. He broke down in tears when the verdict was given. Let’s go to the Old Bailey and our correspondent, Richard Lister. Neil Wallis was the last of the jealous to face legal action. He was and he was clearly relieved and quite emotional as he stood in the dock to hear the decision of the jury. He repeatedly thanked them for finding him not guilty. The prosecution had argued it was inconceivable that is deputy editor at the News of the World he did not know about widespread hacking at the paper. Hacking for which nine people including his former boss Andy Coulson were convicted. But Neil Wallis argued throughout that he was known as a stickler for the rules and someone with a close relationship with the press complaints commission. He said that those engaged in illegal activity he it from him. I asked those engaged in illegal activity he it from him. Iasked him if he blamed those phone hackers at the newspaper including Andy Coulson for landing him in court. I believe that people have got me into this situation where the CPS and Operation Golding detectives, when I first got arrested, started questioning me about my involvement with Milly Dowler. Basic research would have shown that I didn’t even work at the newspaper at the time. That’s how little research went on. It is ten years since allegations are packing first surfaced that News of the World and four years since the new -- of the World and four years since the new -- since the newspaper was forced to close. This is the last scheduled prosecution as a result of this enquiry. Our top story this lunchtime. Heathrow should get a third runway - says a long-awaited report into airport expansion - but critics say it’s a catastrophic decision. And coming up I am meant Wimbledon were Novak Djokovic is already out on Centre Court. But it is the weather that is the hot topic. Later on BBC London. A troubled star- we speak to the director behind the new film, Amy. And it’s already 34 degrees at Heathrow! We’ll bring you the full forecast in 15 minutes. join us then. 15 years ago, the United Nations decided to mark the new millennium with a series of targets aimed at improving the lives of the world’s poorest people. The Millennium Development Goals focused on eradicating poverty and hunger- improving maternal and child health - and more. The targets were supposed to have been met this year. So - how far have they been? Fergus Walsh is in one of the world’s poorest nations, Chad in central Africa. ~ Iam in lamina I am in a health clinic in central Chad. The first of those development goal targets was to have global rates of extreme poverty. That has already been achieved but largely due to spectacular success in China. But not here. In spite of some progress, Chad looks set to fail all of the targets. And on every measure of global development, on health and education and the economy, Chad is at or near the very bottom. This is the face of extreme poverty. Hassimi and her daughter Halima are nomads. They travel across Chad, raising and selling livestock. Millet is the staple diet. It may fill their stomachs, but it’s not enough to keep anyone healthy. Halima will probably never go to school. But for once, she is going to a health clinic. It is a two and a half hour walk. The temperature is A3 degrees. She is four years old, underweight. Her mother is worried. TRANSLATION:. We took to the local healer but she didn’t get better. So now she is coming to hospital and will get food which will make her stronger. Halima isjust 90 centimetres, three foot tall. That means she is stunted, a condition where the body and brain never fully develop. It is due to malnutrition, the failure to get enough healthy food. And it is irreversible. One in four of the world’s children is stunted. Never reaching their full potential. It holds back notjust individuals, but whole economies. So what can be done? Here, mothers have been taught how to prepare more nutritious food. And they are encouraged to breast-feed, the best way to keep infants healthy. At the moment the children here are not going hungry, but many of them are malnourished. The long-term effects can be profound. As well as stunting, malnutrition makes children more vulnerable to illness. It is a factor in nearly half of all child deaths. Making it one of the world’s greatest health problems. One in six children here dies before the age of five. That is the terrible price of poverty. Fergus Walsh, BBC News. The MDG has provided a focus and rallying point for the issues but the fundamental right of every child to survive and thrive. So it would be wrong to dismiss them as a failure because many of those targets are not met. For example 17,000 fewer children die every day than 25 years ago. Chad and sub-Saharan Africa show the challenges that still remain. The sun is out at a scorching Wimbledon. It’s day three of the competition and five Britons are through to the second round. Four of them are men, and that’s the first time that’s happened in nine years. Let’s cross to SW19 and our sports correspondent, Natalie Pirks. The heat has got everyone talking but the clouds have come over in the past hour to provide some respite from the blazing sunshine. The players have been taking it in their stride. As you said it has been near- perfect stride. As you said it has been near-perfect for the British players. Two of them are playing today. More on them later but first we can talk about the weather. For years when there was no proof Centre Court was at the mercy of the rain. This morning it was providing much-needed shade from the sun. The hottest Wimbledon day on record was 34 degrees in the summer of 1976. Today at 11 o’clock the ambient temperature was already nudging 32. But it seems all the talk of the weather is a curiously British obsession. We come from a very hot place in the United States. just an average day really in Sydney! Beautiful, glorious. I love the sunshine. The UK does not get enough. Perhaps that is where Andy Murray trains in Miami where he is used a hotter temperatures. But he admitted yesterday that it is not comfortable out there. It was very hot and that changes the way that the court plays and the weight the match plays out. I was glad to get off in a couple of hours. Ideally you do not want to be playing extremely long matches in those conditions. In 2001 the weather was more in keeping with what we are used to. Grant Denisovich battled through a rain delay in his semi with Tim Henman to reach and to win the final. The only wild card to ever do so. You’re not a fan of the rain at Wimbledon? I am because the rain and the roof saved me. But still I like more sunshine than rain. Speaking of wild cards, Liam Broady is battling the 16th seed David Goffin. He last a hard-fought third set to put a dent in his aspirations. That she lost. Much like this car outside gate number one when a tree fell on the bonnet, nature showing its unpredictability today. Some updates for you, Liam Broady lost the second set to David Goffin and he is now set to lose the match. Novak Djokovic is out on Centre Court against Iago Nieminen. He is 3-2 down at the moment. And later Heather Watson plays Daniel Agger cover. The only British woman left in the draw. And it is notjust Wimbledon that is hot. Forecasters are predicting record high temperatures across the UK today, on what could be the hottest day in a decade. Some areas of Britain will reach temperatures of up to 35 Celsius - hotter than Barcelona and Athens. Health officials say people should avoid physical exertion and drink plenty of liquids. Daniella Relph reports. This is Brighton. Hotter than Barcelona and Ibiza. Hotter than Athens. In much of England amateurs are above 30 degrees today. Here at the Norfolk show there are obvious ways to cool off. But hot temperatures come with a health warning, especially forthe temperatures come with a health warning, especially for the elderly. Older people cannot regulate their body temperature so well. The heart cannot respond as you would if you’re younger and you cannot handle changes in salt and water balance. All these things are critical. In Scotland it is likely to be the hottest day of the year with temperatures in the high 20s in some areas. And similar scenes in Northern Ireland. The skies may be more grey but it is still hot enough for the beach. All the hot weather is being imported from Spain and France. Being dragged across all these countries on to our shores. They have had temperatures in the 1+os, we’re not quite seeing that. The train network is not faring so well in the heat. There are speed restrictions on some services, and attempt to stop the metal tracks rattling. But it does mean delays. The tracks are not fit for purpose. But it is just frustrating. It is either hot weather or the wrong kind of snow, or with some excuse. London is expected to have some of the hottest temperatures of the day. Here at London zoo that means having to improvise. There are regular cold showers for the bearded pigs who can get sunburnt. And the Tigris get blocks of ice filled with chicken wings to keep cool. It seems that the animals are resourceful in the heat. It is only humans that are stupid. We are the ones to sit out in the sun and get burnt. The Tigris and all the other animals seek out the shade of the water. Enjoy it while you can, it will not stay this hot and humid for long. Rain is bmmu hot and humid for long. Rain is forecast in many areas in the coming days. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Ben Rich. It is the peak of the heat wave today. That could be good or bad news depending on your view. Temperatures have dropped off a bit temporarily across the continent. But we have been importing that heat in from the south. These are the temperatures we have had so far today. Up to 34 degrees already. But even further north around 31 degrees in Carlisle. We have also imported some cloud from the south. And through the rest of the afternoon as temperatures rise, there is the increasing risk of some thunderstorms. For Northern Ireland, dodging most of the action for the time being, just a pleasant summer day. But for Scotland there is an increasing risk of sundry downpours. Some relief does to the coast. The odd shower breaking out across southern England and Wales. Most bases dry with a high of 36 degrees in London. The record warmest Wimbledon day was back in 1976. Today the there is a chance that we could exceed that record. There could also be a shower at Wimbledon this afternoon. This evening and tonight for the North of England and Scotland we have some heavy downpours. Not everywhere, but if you do catch one you will know about it. There is the risk of localised flooding. Elsewhere during the night not quite so impressive as last night. But temperatures still holding up into the 20s in some parts. Tomorrow we have one cold front trying to push on from the West which will introduce some less humid air. Further south and east we have another weather front bringing some downpours through the first part of tomorrow. Generally a little more cloud around tomorrow. The best of the sunshine in western areas. And the temperature is not so hot humid as today. Friday starts with that pressure feel and also starts dry with some sunshine. But later in ",,

Brought home - the bodies of the holidaymakers killed in Tunisia in the deadliest attack on Britons since the 7/7 bombings. Eight coffins were carried off a plane at RAF Brize Norton including three members of one family. The eight are the first of what’s believed to be 30 Britons killed while they enjoyed a holiday in the sun. More bodies are expected to be repatriated by the RAF in the coming days. A family of 12 from Luton ranging from a one year-old baby to grandparents in their 70s, are believed to have gone to Syria. An official report recommends a third runway at Heathrow - but as the arguments begin, will it ever happen? ~ Iam in I am in Bangladesh looking at progress made reaching towards the UN’s development goals and at the barriers still faced by women and girls. Tonight on BBC London: A special programme from Harmondsworth, a village that’ll be practically wiped out if Heathrow expands. We’ll have reaction from all sides on this huge issue for the capital. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. In the last few hours, the first bodies of British holidaymakers killed in last week’s gun attack in Tunisia have arrived back in the UK. They were flown by an RAF transporter plane to Brize Norton in Oxfordshire. Family and friends watched as eight coffins covered in flowers were carried off the plane and into a waiting hearse - one by one. Robert Hall reports from Brize Norton. Slowing in the Tunis traffic, the small convoy passed almost unnoticed. A handful of vehicles, eight visitors to this country under escort for theirjourney home. By mid-afternoon, the aircraft was dropping through the heat to RAF Brize Norton. This is a military community, which has taken pride in respecting service personnel who lost their lives overseas. Today’s programme reflected those priorities. No flags, just simple white flowers, as one by one, they were carried to the waiting hearses. The first three represented a single family. Adrian Evans, his father, Patrick Evans and his nephew, joel Richard. joel was a football referee and all three supported Walsall. A carpet of scarves and condolences was laid outside the club. Dennis Thwaites, 70, died with his wife. His son-in-law said the deaths had left a void which could never be filled. 2li-year-old Carly Love it had been looking forward to her wedding. Herfamily said herfuture had been taken away. Stephen Mellor had shielded his wife during the attack. She was badly injured and is now back in the UK. His community in the Cornish town of men held a candlelit vigil in his memory. And john Storey from Nottinghamshire who worked with children in care. His wife described him as a devoted father, a man who gave his best to others. In the House of Commons, the Prime Minister said support would be available to every family. Every family of victim has a Foreign Office liaison officer. I have asked the Cabinet Secretary for advice on creating a ministerial committee to make sure work is created across government to support all the victims of this attack are looked after and as a nation we mark and commemorate this event appropriately. This couple from Leeds were the last of the 30 British people to be named. I have watched his kids grow up, his grandkids grow up. It is devastating. The cortege is en route to west London where postmortems will be carried out. Inquests can be formally opened and adjourned, so funerals can be arranged. The cortege has been delayed slightly and believe in the next half an hour, after what has been a sombre and difficult afternoon. But all of us who have attended repatriations here at Brize Norton have been struck IV attention to detail and dignity. An entire family from Luton ranging from a one year-old baby to a 75 year-old grandparent are believed to have crossed into Syria. The family of 12 have not been seen since they flew to Istanbul in April. The city has become a gateway for foreign fighters and their families looking to cross from Turkey to Syria to join so-called Islamic State. Lucy Manning has the story. One family, three generations, from the 75-year-old grandfather, to the one-year-old child, it is thought this family could be in Syria. 12 family members, the grandparents, four sons, family members, the grandparents, foursons, her four sons, her daughter, two daughters-in-law and three young children. The community is extremely worried about the family. There are three generations of the family. The elderly parents, I believe the father is very old and frail. The mother, she has been diagnosed with cancer. She obviously needs treatment. The family initially travelled to Bangladesh via Istanbul on the 10th of April. They flew back to Istanbul on the 11th of May and were due to return to Heathrow three days later. However, they didn’t and a relative reported them missing on the 17th of May. Counterterror police searched the house, but their disappearance wasn’t made oblique. Many police here. -- disappearance wasn’t made oblique. Many police here. -- made public. Many police officers. A lot of police. What did they do? We don’t know really, we don’t know. But day and night, around about two weeks, many police. There is no one at the family home in Luton, but in a statement a relative said this is completely out of character, they are now worried they could be in some danger. They said they believed the family might have been tricked into going there, because this was no place for the elderly or the young. This man is one of the sons who is believed to have travelled with his wife. His brother is also missing. Locals believe one of the women in the family could have radicalised other members. Friends of this 19-year-old are shocked. Obviously, I was gobsmacked when I heard. He is a nice guy, it generallyjust an ordinary person. Did he ever give any clues he was going to Syria? No, just an ordinary guy. He was cool. This is another British community with a family feared to be taking old and young to a war zone. A third runway at Heathrow has moved a step closer after a long-awaited report said it should go ahead. Some business groups have welcomed the recommendation but London’s mayor Boris johnson said Heathrow was the ""worst option by miles"". Mr Cameron, who categorically ruled out a third runway back in 2009, said a decision would be made by the end of the year. Our Business Editor Kamal Ahmed has more. A few fields, a few hundred houses and now, the battle ground over Britain’s aviation future. This unassuming patch of land to the west of London, is the proposed site for the UK’s first third for runway built in this crowded corner of the country since the 1940s. How does the UK remain connected to the world when its main airports of all? Sir Howard Davies told me he has the answer. The economic and fits of expanding Heathrow are much greater than any other option we have looked at. You get trade benefits, connectivity benefits and additional long haul routes to important cities in emerging markets will be crucial to our economy in the 21st century. What is the case for Heathrow? 147 billion pounds boost for the economy over the next 60 years. More flights, ticket prices could fall by £20 per passenger by 2030. There is plenty of evidence for the case against. More flights could mean more noise, although night flights will be banned. Air pollution could leave the UK missing its European and environmental targets. Sir Howard Davies has produced a substantial report on the economic case for a new runway here at Heathrow. This is very much is the front line there is the village warehouses will be demolished. What do residents think about the fact this huge and busy airport could now be expanded? It is a name that will become synonymous with the battle over a she aged -- become synonymous with the battle over a she aged -- aviation expansion. It is here that most people, understandably, are most opposed. The village will be cut in half by the new runway. I live in that little coach house and it is 54 paces from my front door to the new boundary, which is here. So everybody that site, 750 homes and families get destroyed. Their life here is over. just down the road in Bedford, it is a different mood. 15, 20 minutes maximum. This man runs a small minicab firm which he thinks can expand, providing some of the 70,000 jobs the report says will come with the third runway. We hope we get more business from the airport. It is expansion for everybody, more drivers and more jobs. Sir Howard did not totally rule out Gatwick, he said a second runway there remained a credible choice. The strongest case with the fastest deliver, the cleanest and the quietest. When the government decides later this year, we remain of the view they will back Gatwick. But Sir Howard claims he has made the economic case for Heathrow. But this will not be a decision made by him, it will be made by the government. The recommendation for a third runway at Heathrow in today’s report presents a political headache for the Prime Minister. He’s facing a possible revolt from inside his own party with several senior Tory figures against it. Our Deputy Political Correspondent james Landale reports. Britain’s giantair Britain’s giant air terminal... Almost from the moment Heathrow opens, there has been talk of building more runways as the economy has grown. But it has never happened. Above all, because of politics. Within moments of these proposals being published, those opposed to Heathrow were out in force. I don’t think you can do this in 21st century, Western European society. Yes, maybe in some Communist regime in the 19 these, but this is too environmentally damaging. The Tory MP hoping to replace him as the London mayor said it would be bad for the environment and bad for his constituents. I made a pledge years ago I would trigger a by-election. There is no wriggle room in the pledge I made. He is not alone. Five Tory ministers with seats around Heathrow, all have their concerns. As for their boss, he said in 2009, a third runway at Heathrow was not going ahead. A promise he does not want to be seen to break. But, David Cameron is under huge pressure from business, the Treasury, to back a third runway at Heathrow. Senior Tory MPs say they expect Mr Cameron to bite the bullet and put what they say is the national interest ahead of Boris johnson’s interests, regardless of the political costs. Today, David Cameron promised MPs a decision by the end of the year. There is a detailed report and it is important we study it. If we say anything now before studying the report, you could endanger what ever decision is made. Labour said it would act Heathrow expansion, potentially making Heathrow expansion, potentially making it easier to head off a rebellion in the Commons. He seems to be keen to get off the issue of airports. It seems like he is in a holding pattern above Heathrow and Boris will not let him land. For years, the expansion of Heathrow showed little sign of getting off the ground. Now David Cameron faces one of the toughest decisions of his Premiership. The mercury has been soaring across the UK with the hottest july day on record. Temperatures hit 36.7 degrees Celsius in west London, elsewhere they hovered between 30 and 33 degrees. Sarah Campbell is in central London. It looks glorious with people cooling off? Everybody is trying to cool down. This is King’s Cross bathing pond. Less easy if you are on a traffic jam. Summer in the city and people of all ages have been trying to keep cool. On the east coast of Scotland, a dip in the sea to cool off warm toes. And at the Norfolk show, visitors lapped up the dairy products on offer. Temperatures peaked in London and the south-east with Kew Gardens a sweltering 36 degrees. It’s currently 60 degrees cooler inside Kew’s tropical palm house than it is outside. People are coming in here to escape the heat. Earlier on, the sun was out full blast and the temperature was a lot higher than it is now. And now it is 34.8. And now it is 34.8, yes and the public are wilting and looking for shade but we have plenty of that around Kew. Parts of the UK have been hotter than Rio, Athens and Rome, enjoyed by many but with the heat, the health warnings for the very young and elderly. Older people can’t regulate their body temperature quite so well. Their heart can’t respond as it would if you were younger and also you can’t handle changes in salt and water balance. All these changes are critical to keeping you well in very hot weather. The transport network has suffered, with speed restrictions on many rail lines amid fears the tracks could buckle. On the M20 in Kent, council and volunteer workers handed out water to queueing drivers. In Glasgow, there were mixed views about the 25 degrees heat. It is a bit too hot, we’ve had to get fans and stuff in work. just too hot, it’s hard to work in. just come to the park and read my book. We don’t often get the sun coming out like this so it’s nice tojust... It makes a change from all the rain we get. The weather is set to change, but the brief heatwave has brought a tropical feel to Britain’s shores. Our top story this evening: The bodies of eight of the holidaymakers killed in Tunisia in the deadliest attack on Britons since the 7/7 bombings are brought home. Here in Edmonton, England’s women Later on BBC London, we’re in Harmondsworth, where many are fiercely opposed to a third runaway at Heathrow. We’ll talk to campaigners who say it’ll destroy their village. And speak to businesses who say it’ll mean more jobs and opportunities. 15 years ago the United Nations marked the new millennium with a series of pledges to improve the lives of the world’s poorest people. Have the goals made a difference in people’s lives? Well, the picture is mixed. In developing countries the number of people living in extreme poverty has declined by more than half and, on average, 91% of children now enrol in school- that’s 43 million more than in 2000. But, despite the progress achieved, 800 million people still live in extreme poverty and 16,000 children die each day before their 5th birthday. Mishal Husain has been looking at how Bangladesh has fared and joins us now from Dhaka. Fiona, we are in the main market in the centre of Dhaka this evening. It is a thriving scene. Bangladesh has done well on some of the key UN targets, helped by good economic growth. But there is a sense here that to go further it will need to do more for its women. There are still not enough in the workforce and there are too many girls dropping out of school, and even marrying while they are still children. Morning exercises at a Dhaka school. The girls and the boys, lining up alongside each other. Bangladesh has done a lot to get its children into education, with as many girls as boys now starting primary school. He wants to improve his English... There’s little need to encourage aspiration and ambition in girls like Mohsina. She’s ten years old and knows exactly what she wants to do. TRANSLATION: A doctor. I want to be a doctor. But I know I can’t be lazy, I’ll need to study a lot. Only hard work can help me achieve my goals. But it’s in the teenage years that the barriers for young women in Bangladesh start to mount, particularly for the less privileged. Shanaz was 14 when she got married. Now 15, she is six months pregnant. Her husband beat her when he didn’t receive the promised dowry, and then abandoned her. She says she told her parents she didn’t want to get married so young. TRANSLATION: Isaid no, it was a child marriage and no girl can be happy getting married at such an early age. I told them several times I didn’t want to get married. I have a right to make my own decision. They said, no, it is for your happiness. Finally they said, if you don’t marry, we’ll abandon you. What would you have liked your life to be if you had been able to stay in school? TRANSLATION: If I had spent more time in school, I could have got a good job. Now I don’t have the opportunity. How can I expect to get a decentjob? The only options are factory work for domestic work. work or domestic work. Shanaz’s story is not unusual. Bangladesh has the world’s highest rate of marriage for girls under 15 and the government’s commitment to tackling it has been questioned. But the Prime Minister told me that the outlook for girls is improving. Now they are going to school, they are going to college, they are getting education. And also we have created job opportunities for them. If you can engage them, then, automatically, it’s reduced. The parents should think, no, for girls, marriage is not the only ultimate goal. Bangladesh has achieved some of its development goals. But to go further in its fight against poverty, it will need to unlock the potential of all of its women. That means keeping them in education and raising their chances of a betterjob, and a better future. Michelle Hussain, BBC News, Dhaka. Greece’s Prime Minister has called on the country to vote no in this weekend’s referendum on whether to accept the reforms being demanded by Greece’s creditors. Meanwhile Alexis Tsipras has offered them another deal. But Germany insists that any discussion of new terms will not be possible until after the referendum. Our Europe editor Katya Adler is in Athens. How do you interpret this latest move from the Greek Prime Minister? Is itjust more of the same? Well, it’s been a day of high drama here. At this stage, the politics between Greece and its creditors are as important as the economic ‘s, and relations aren’t good. The Greek Prime Minister seemed to contradict himself today, firstly seeming to come closer to their demands and then openly insulting them on public television. Germany’s Angela Merkel says there is no point talking to him seriously ahead of Sunday’s referendum. Remember, when these politicians seem to talk to each other, they often actually have a message for people back home. Angela Merkel knows that her taxpayers are fed up of throwing money at Greece, as they see it, and the grip Prime Minister will make any moves he believes will strengthen his hand ahead of the referendum. -- Greek. A former Deputy Editor of the News of the World, Neil Wallis, has been found not guilty of conspiring to hack phones. Mr Wallis argued that he hadn’t known thatjournalists at the newspaper were intercepting voicemails and that he had no involvement at all with the hacking of Milly Dowler’s phone. Now, could they become the first England football team to reach a World Cup final since 1966? The English Women’s team take onjapan tonight in a World Cup semi-final in Canada. And our sports correspondent Katie Gornall is there for us now. Katie, a big night ahead? That’s right. The biggest in their history. All through this World Cup, the England coach Mark Sampson has been fond of the phrase, we are in a good place. Recently he has had to upgrade that is saying that they are in a great place. The one place he wants to be is in the final in Vancouver on Sunday. First, his side have to overcome the defending champions, japan, have to overcome the defending champions,japan, in champions, japan, in Edmonton, at the Commonwealth Stadium. Takes it wide. Can she finish from here? jodie Taylor! Yes, she has! Against expectations, England are still standing. And, after spoiling Canada’s party in the quarterfinal, they want to give people back home something extra to celebrate. We really do feel like the nation is behind us, which gives us another boost. There’s just something special about this team, in the air, something that we all feel. We have the mentality that we have a really good chance of going on to win the tournament. First, they must beat the defending champions, japan - a team known as the Barcelona of women’s football. Technically brilliant, tactically astute and daunting opposition. The last time any England team was in this position was at Italia 90. Back then, Gary Lineker’s goals brought the country as close as they’ve ever come to winning a World Cup on foreign soil. 25 years on, it’s time for the men to be the cheerleaders. We know what it’s like when you’re watching something at home and the country’s successful. It motivates other people to take part and young girls will be desperate to get out there and kick a football. And that’s a great thing. It could be a watershed moment. England appear to be enjoying their role as the tournament’s outsiders. Spirit and strength has seen them this far. Now we’ll see if this team has something extra special. Katie Gornall, BBC News, Edmonton. On day three at Wimbledon it’s British Women’s number one Heather Watson who will make all the headlines .In In the last hour she’s beaten former top five ranked Daniela Hantuchcova in straight sets. It’s only the second time Watson has made it into the Wimbledon third round. She’s now likely to meet the imposing figure of Serena Williams. The man dubbed the British Oskar Schindler has died aged 106. Sir Nicholas Winton saved the lives of 669 mainlyjewish children by helping them flee the Nazis in Czechoslovakia in the run up to the Second World War and placing them with British families. Nick Higham looks back at his remarkable legacy. Formal accolades came late to Nicholas Winton. He was 105 when the Czech Republic last year awarded him its highest honour, watched by some of those he helped save more than 75 years earlier. He had been 92 when the British government knighted him, a modest sort of hero. He calls himself an ordinary man. But what he did was remarkable. The Nazis had seized part of Czechoslovakia and Prague was full of refugees. Nicholas Winton helped organise trains to take jewish children out of the country to Britain and found them homes. He met them at Liverpool Street station, where there is now a memorial. Few knew what he had done until, in 1988, his wife found the names of the rescued children among papers in his loft. To me, it was something that I’d done when I was quite young, and the war had intervened and it was finished. It’s wonderful, a nice feeling that you’ve done the right thing. You don’t often do that in your life, do you? You are actually sitting next to Nicholas Winton. In an emotional episode of the TV programme That’s Life, he was reunited with some of those he had saved. They called him Britain’s Oskar Schindler, though he could not help everyone. Eight kindertransport trains left Prague. A ninth was stopped the day war was declared. All 250 on board perished. Sir Nicholas Winton, who died today at the age of 106. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Nick Miller How long is this heatwave going to go on for? He’d like this is a one-day wonder, but extraordinary, to break the july record on the first day. The hottest day at the tennis as well, nearly 30 in Scotland. If you don’t like 37, the 25 at Belfast looks inviting. A lot of cloud drifting north across the UK, with some showers and thunderstorms, drying up in Wales soon. Still some downpours in northern England and Scotland over the next few hours. Torrential downpours are isolated in nature. It will turn a little bit fresher from the west overnight, but no relief over eastern parts of England. A very warm and sultry night to come, difficult for sitting. Tomorrow will be less hot and humid. Still very warm and the sun makes an appearance. Like today, there will be areas of plywood, showers and thunderstorms drifting north and east. Not exactly where you see them here, there was some uncertainty about the flying -- here, there was some uncertainty about the flying -- fine detail. Heavy thunderstorms across Scotland and Northern Ireland. We could see a spell of wet weather pushing east across northern England. It looks largely dry in Wales and southwestern in. You will be taking note of these temperatures, much lower compared with today. It looks like for South East England we will see a shower in the morning. That could have an impact on Wimbledon. No guarantee, but something to be aware of. It looks like things clearer as we go deeper into the day stop Friday looks a decent day, but the heat starts to build in southern areas, head of thunderstorms that move north across the UK. The weekend, though showers clear Scotland and Northern Ireland at the start of the weekend. Fresher by Sunday, with sunshine and showers. We are getting back to more typical British weather. The extreme heat is a one-day wonder, but what a day! Tonight on BBC London, a special programme live from Harmondsworth. We are in the village where a third Heathrow runway could be built. Many businesses are delighted at the promise of billions in investment and tens of thousands of newjobs in West London. But there’s frustration over how long that’ll take. Get on with it. I think that is what British business wants. You have got the likes of Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam, who have all got the infrastructure in place to deal with long haul, and if we don’t get on with it, we will be left behind. But with furious opposition from thousands of people who fear being affected by noise and pollution, will Heathrow ever expand? It is going to take 50 years to build it. By the time we do that, it will be completely fun. They will need to come back for a fourth runway, and the effects on London will be totally devastating. Plus, Gatwick Airport’s down, but not out. It’s boss says they’ve ""got everything to play for"". And it’s been the hottest day in 9 years. How Londoners cooled down as the mercury rose. Good evening and a very warm welcome from Harmondsworth, just north west of Heathrow Airport. Let me put this village into perspective if a third runway where to be built. It would cut this village in half. You can probably just see the local pub behind me obscure by the huge media interest in this story. Behind that, the church. They would stay. However, if you turn to my right you can see the post office and village shop. Everything behind there would be the perimeter fence of a third runway. You can understand why people here are anxious and angry. This is an ",,
31,BBC News 24,1-jul-2015,BBC News at Ten,22:00,30 mins,True,"# Oh, no # Well, my left hand’s free Tonight at Ten: Heathrow is the controversial choice for expanding airport capacity in the south-east of England. A long-awaited report says that building a third runway is the best option despite concerns about environmental damage. You get additional trade benefits, connectivity benefits, additional long haul routes to important cities in emerging markets which will be crucialfor in emerging markets which will be crucial for our economy in the 21st century. But the scheme is firmly opposed by many local people and by some prominent Conservative politicians. ~ Ijust don’t think I just don’t think that you go do this kind of thing in 21st century western European society. Yes, maybe in some communist regime in the 1950s. But this is too environmentally damaging. The decision on to proceed will present a big political challenge for David Cameron. We will have the latest. Also tonight: The bodies of eight Britons killed in Tunisia by an Islamist gunman have arrived home.

Angry pensioners in Greece demand their money as frantic efforts are made to solve the country’s debt crisis. Is there anyone in the audience tonight who owes their life to Nicolas Winton? has died the age of 106. Tonight on BBC London: We’ll have reaction from the people of west London to the news that Heathrow will get a third runway if the Government agrees to the airport commission’s proposals for expansion. Good evening. The Mayor of London, Borisjohnson, has declared that a new runway at Heathrow won’t happen despite the recommendation of the Airports Commission. After almost three years of consideration the Commission said today that a third runway for Heathrow was its clear and unanimous choice. But a third runway would come with severe restrictions, including a ban on night flights and limits on noise. David Cameron said a decision would be made later this year. Live to Heathrow and our business editor Kamal Ahmed. Yes, it’s still pretty warm here at Heathrow and pretty noisy and one group that did give a pretty warm and pretty noisy welcome to today’s expansion plans were business leaders. There is quite a bit of concern that London’s airports could befalling behind our international competitors, whether that’s in Amsterdam or the 2li-hour airport thatis Amsterdam or the 2li-hour airport that is operate across the Middle East and in. But, of course, the controversial aviation debate goes far deeperthan simple controversial aviation debate goes far deeper than simple economic arguments. A few fields, a few hundred houses and now the battle ground over Britain’s aviation future. This unassuming patch of land to the west of London is the proposed site for the UK’s first full-length runway built in this most crowded corner of the country since the 1940s. The key question - how does the UK remain connected to the world when its main airports are full? Sir Howard Davies told me he has the answer. The economic benefits of expanding Heathrow are greater than any other option we have looked at. You get additional trade benefits, productivity benefits, additional long haul routes to important cities and emerging markets which will be crucial for our economy in the 21st Century. What is the case for Heathrow? A EM7 billion boost for the UK economy in the next 60 years. With more flights, ticket prices could fall by £20 per passenger by 2030. Also evidence for the case against. More flights could mean more noise, though night flights would be banned. And air pollution is expected to rise but the report said there should be a legal commitment to limit poor air quality. Sir Howard Davies has produced a substantial report on the economic case for a new runway here at Heathrow. This very much is the front-line. There is Harmondsworth, the village where houses will be demolished. What do the residents think about the fact that this huge and busy airport could now be expanded? It is a name that will become synonymous with the battle over aviation expansion. It is here that people are, understandably, most opposed. Their village will be cut in half by the new runway. I live in that little coach house and it is 51+ paces from my front door to the new boundary, which is here. So basically everybody that side, 750 homes and families, get destroyed. just down the road in Bedford, it is a different mood. This man runs a minicab firm which he says will be able to expand, providing some of the 70,000 jobs the report says will come with the third runway. We hope we will get more business, more cars into the business and it is expansion for everyone. We will have more drivers, morejobs. Sir Howard did not totally rule out Gatwick. He said a second runway there remained a credible choice. We have the strongest case. We are the fastest to deliver. We are the cleanest and quietest and we still remain of the view that the Government will back Gatwick when it decides later this year. But business leaders do back expansion at Heathrow and Sir Howard claims he has made the economic case. But in the end, this will not be a decision made by him, but made by the Government. The commission’s preferred option of a third runway at Heathrow produces a significant political challenge for David Cameron who expressed his firm opposition to the idea before he became Prime Minister. He’s facing the real prospect of a rebellion among his own party colleagues, including some of the party’s most prominent names, as our deputy political editorjames Landale reports. 'Britain’s giant air terminal at London Airport is rapidly 'being developed into the finest in the world...' Almost from the moment Heathrow opened, there’s been talk of building more runways as the economy’s grown. But it’s never happened, above all because of politics - politics like this. Within minutes of today’s proposals being published, MPs opposed to a bigger Heathrow were out in force. I just don’t think you can do this kind of thing in 21st-Century western European society. Yes, maybe in some communist regime in the 1950s. But this is too environmentally damaging. The Tory MP hoping to replace him as London Mayor said a third runway would be bad for the environment and bad for his constituents. I made a pledge years ago that I would trigger a by-election if my party gives the green light to expansion. Obviously, that pledge stands. There’s no wiggle room in the pledge that I made. And he is not alone. Five Tory Cabinet Ministers with seats around Heathrow all have their concerns. And as for their boss, well, he said in 2009 that a third runway at Heathrow was not going ahead. No ifs, no buts - a promise that he doesn’t want to be seen to break, even if he didn’t repeat it in his election manifesto this year. But David Cameron is under huge pressure from business and the Treasury to back a third runway at Heathrow. And senior Tory MPs have told me they expect Mr Cameron to eventually to bite the bullet and put what they say is the national interest ahead of Boris johnson’s interest, regardless of the political cost. Today, Mr Cameron promised MPs a decision by the end of the year. It is important now that there’s a detailed report, that we study it and I’m clear about the legal position that if we say anything now before studying the report, you could endanger whatever decision is made. Labour said it would back Heathrow expansion, potentially making it easier for David Cameron to head off any rebellion in the Commons. He seems to be keen to get off the issue of airports. It seems like he’s in a holding pattern above Heathrow and that Boris won’t let him land. So David Cameron now faces one of the toughest decisions of his premiership. But even if he does decide to expand Heathrow, another prime minister will be in charge of making it happen, and it could be 15 years before any planes are taking off from a new runway. The repatriation of the bodies of eight British nationals who were among the victims of the terrorist shooting in Tunisia last week has taken place. They were brought back by the Royal Air Force to Brize Norton airbase this afternoon. The number of British tourists confirmed dead has now risen to 29. Our correspondent Robert Hall reports. Slowing in Tunis traffic, the small convoy passed almost unnoticed. A handful of vehicles, eight visitors to this country under escort for theirjourney home. By mid-afternoon, the giant aircraft was dropping through the heat haze to RAF Brize Norton. This is a military community which has taken pride in respecting service personnel who lost their lives overseas. The programme today reflected those priorities. No flags, just simple bouquets of white flowers as one by one, the coffins were carried to the waiting hearses. The first three represented a single family, Adrian Evans, his father Patrick Evans and his nephewjoel Richards. joel Richards was a football referee and all three supported Walsall, a carpet of scarves and condolences laid outside the club. Denis Thwaites, who was 70, died with his wife Elaine. His son-in-law said the deaths had left a void which could never be filled. 2lI-year-old Carly Lovett had been looking forward to her wedding. Her family said her future had been cruelly taken away. Stephen Mellor had shielded his wife Cheryl during the attack. She was badly injured and is now back in the UK. His community in the Cornish town of Bodmin held a candlelit vigil in his memory. And john Stollery from Nottinghamshire, who worked with children in care. His wife described him as a devoted father, a man who gave his best to others. In the House of Commons, the Prime Ministers said support would be available to every family. I’ve asked the Cabinet Secretary for advice on creating a ministerial committee to make sure work is coordinated across government to provide all the support that victims of this appalling attack deserve and make sure that as a nation we mark and commemorate this event appropriately. Today, Christopher and Sharon Bell from Leeds were the last of the 30 British dead to be named. I’ve watched his kids and grandkids grow up. When you work with him so many years, it is devastating. The cortege was Escorted to London where postmortems will be carried out. Inquests will be opened and the bodies released for burial. Brize Norton will offer support and dignity to all who need it. In Luton, police are investigating the disappearance of 12 members of the same family amid fears that they’ve travelled to Syria. The group - including two grandparents and a one-year-old child - flew into Istanbul in May on their way home from a trip to Bangladesh and did not return to the UK. Our special correspondent Lucy Manning reports. One family, three generations. From the 75-year-old grandfather to the one-year-old child, it’s thought this Luton family could now be in Syria. 12 family members, the grandparents, four sons, a daughter, two daughters-in-law and three young children. We are extremely worried about the family, there is three generations of the family. The elderly parents, I believe the father, he is very old, very frail. The mother has been diagnosed with cancer. So she needs, obviously, treatment. The family initially travelled to Bangladesh via Istanbul on the 10th of April. They flew back to Istanbul on the 11th of May and were due to return to Heathrow three days later. However, they didn’t, and a relative reported them missing on the 17th of May. Counterterror police then searched the house, but their disappearance wasn’t made public. Many, many police here, many police cars, police officers. And a lot of police! What did they do? We do not know, really we don’t know, but day and night, two weeks I think it is so many police. There is now no-one at the family home in Luton, but in a statement, a relative said that this was completely out of character, that they are now worried that they could be in some danger. They said they believed that the family might have been tricked into going there, because this was no place for the elderly or the young. This is Mohammed Saker, one of the sons who, it is believed, has travelled with his wife. His brother, Mohammed Zayd Hussain, is also missing. Locals believe one of the women in the family could have radicalised other members. Friends of 19-year-old Mohammed Toufique Hussain are shocked. Obviously, I was gobsmacked when I heard about it, he was a nice guy, he wasjust generally, you know, he was a normal guy, an ordinary person. And did he ever give any clues that he was going to go to Syria? No, he was just an ordinary guy, you know, he was chilling, it was all cool. This is another British community with a family feared to be taking old and young to a war zone. Lucy Manning, BBC News, Luton. In Greece, the Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras says he’s going ahead with the referendum this weekend on the terms of the bailout offered by Greece’s creditors. Mr Tsipras said he wanted Greeks to vote no, while at the same time making a new offer to lenders to try to end the debt crisis. He says he’s now ready to accept most of the conditions imposed by the IMF, the European Commission, and the European Central Bank. Our Europe editor, Katya Adler, is in Athens and sent this report. With desperation in the air, Greek pensioners pushed and jostled their way into banks opened especially for them today. Some queued all night to be first in line to get very little of what is actually theirs. 120 euros of their savings is all they were allowed - no more for at least a week. We found these pensioners rowing about the state of their country at a local cafe. They told me they needed their money to support children and grandchildren - out of work in austerity Greece. Yanis was particularly upset. TRANSLATION: Today I went to the bank to get my 120 euros, but when I got to the front of the queue, they told me there was no money. It was there all these years, where has my money gone? Greece is awash with unanswered questions, a sense of insecurity and helplessness. The Greek Prime Minister added to the confusion today, first indicating he was coming far closer to his creditors’ demands, then shortly after. .. ..insulting them on national television, calling them autocratic and anti-democratic, describing their bailout conditions as blackmail and urging his people to vote against them in a referendum he has called this Sunday. There was a tight-lipped response from his eurozone colleagues. There is no point talking, they said, until after your referendum. At this point in proceedings, the politics between Greece and its creditors are as important as the economic, and relations are pretty dire. But the most pressing problem right now for the Greek Prime Minister is that, for the first time in five years, he has no access to international funding from the EU or the IMF. Banks remain closed here, the old bail-out deal expired yesterday, there is no sight of a new one, and people we are talking to here say they are being pushed to the edge. The Greeks are increasingly divided on what to do next. This taxi driver disagrees with her Prime Minister. She’ll vote yes to the demands of Greece’s creditors in Sunday’s referendum - with a heavy heart, she told me. The minute that I will vote yes to those measure, I will be crying. I don’t care if I’ll starve. I know that my children will starve. And we are not strong to say no. Sorry. The referendum could be a turning point for Greece. It will be keenly watched across Europe. Katya Adler, BBC News, Athens. 15 years ago, the United Nations marked the new millennium with a series of pledges to improve the lives of the worlds poorest people. But have those goals made a notable difference? Experts say the results are not consistent. The number of people living in extreme poverty has declined by more than half. And on average, 91% of children now enrole in primary school, A3 million more than in 2000. But despite the progress, 800 million people still live in extreme poverty, and 16,000 children die each day before their fifth birthday. My colleague Mishal Husain has been looking at how Bangladesh has fared, and she joins us now from Dhaka. Huw, we are in the main market in the centre of Dhaka this evening, a thriving scene, and Bangladesh has done well on some of those targets, helped by economic growth. But to go further, women are going to need to play a bigger role in the economy. Today too many girls are dropping out of school here and even marrying while they are still children. Morning exercises at a Dhaka school, the girls and the boys, lining up alongside each other.

But I know I can’t be lazy, I’ll need to study a lot. Only hard work can help me achieve my goals. But it’s in the teenage years that the barriers for young women in Bangladesh start to mount, particularly for the less privileged. Shanaz was 14 when she got married. Now 15, she is six months pregnant. Her husband beat her when he didn’t receive the promised dowry and then abandoned her. She says that she told her parents that she didn’t want to get married so young. TRANSLATION: I said no, it was a child marriage and no girl can be happy getting married at such an early age. I told them several times I didn’t want to get married. I have a right to make my own decision. They said, ""No, it is for your happiness."" Finally they said, ""If you don’t marry, we’ll abandon you."" What would you have liked your life to be if you had been able to stay in school?

The only options are factory work or domestic work. Shanaz’s story is not unusual. Bangladesh has the world’s highest rate of marriage for girls under 15 and the government’s commitment to tackling it has been questioned. Bangladesh may have achieved some of its development goals, but to go further in its fight against poverty, it will need to unlock the potential of all of its women. That means keeping them in education and raising their chances of a betterjob and a better future. The first of the UN goals is about extreme poverty and hunger. In Chad, one of the poorest countries in the world, one in every three children is undernourished. Our medical correspondent Fergal Walsh has travelled there to see the effect of extreme hunger. This is the face of extreme poverty. Hasine and her daughter Halime are nomads. They travel across Chad raising and selling livestock. Millet is the staple diet. It may fill their stomachs, but it’s not enough to keep anyone help me. ~ -- healthy. Halime will probably never go to school, but for once she’s going to a health clinic. It’s a two and a half hour walk, the temperature is A3 degrees. She’s four years old and underweight. Her mother is worried. TRANSLATION: We took her to the local healer, and she didn’t get better, so now she’s going to hospital and will get food, which will make her stronger. Halime isjust 90 centimetres, three foot tall. That means she is stunted, a condition where the body and brain never fully develop. It is due to malnutrition, the failure to get enough healthy food, and it is irreversible. One in four of the world’s children is stunted, never reaching their full potential. It holds back notjust individuals but whole economies. So what can be done? Here, mothers are being taught how to prepare more nutritious food, and they are encouraged to breast-feed, the best way to keep infants healthy. At the moment, the children here are not going hungry, but many of them are malnourished. The long-term effects can be profound. As well as stunting, malnutrition makes children more vulnerable to illness. It’s a factor in nearly half of all child deaths, making it one of the world’s greatest health problems. Tackling malnutrition means tackling poverty. With a population doubling every 25 years, that will require investment in Chad’s people, like this man, who depends on rain that may never come.

Parts of England have experienced their hottest july day since records began, breaking the previous record high setback in 2006. Hot weather was a contributing factor to a large fire which took hold of around 30 acres of Thetford Forest in Norfolk. Many were enjoying the sun, but paramedics were reporting a surge in calls with warnings being issued to young children, the elderly, those with serious illnesses. On day three at Wimbledon, the British women’s number one, Heather Watson, has won her second-round match in straight sets. APPLAUSE And she’s through! She beat the former top five ranking player Daniela Hantuchova. It’s only the second time that Heather Watson has made it into the Wimbledon third round, where she will meet Serena Williams. England’s women are in action in the World Cup shortly in the biggest football match in the team’s history. It is the first time they have reached the competition’s semifinal, and they kick off against the holders, japan, in 90 minutes’ time in Edmonton, Canada. Our correspondent Katie Gornall is at the Commonwealth Stadium. Yes, Huw, both teams have now arrived here at the stadium, some of the England players are checking the surface ahead of what will be the biggest match of their careers. There is no shortage of support for them, in net tactics meeting they received a surprise vocal from Prince William wishing them luck. -- a surprise phone call. Even the Palace is wishing them luck with this one. Against expectations, England are still standing, and after spoiling Canada’s party in the quarterfinal, they want to give people back home something extra to celebrate. Anyone who watches the game back home, we’re certainly going to feel that support, and it might make the difference. So if you are considering going to bed, just consider you don’t want to be the one who lets us down. Standing in England’s way are defending champions japan, a team known as the Barcelona of women’s football - technically brilliant, tactically astute, and daunting opposition. The last time any England team was in this position was at Italia ‘90. Back then, Gary Lineker’s goals brought the country as close as they’ve ever come to winning a World Cup on foreign soil. 25 years on, it’s time for the men to be the cheerleaders. It could be a watershed moment. We know what it’s like when you’re watching something at home and the country is successful, it motivates other people to take part, and young girls will be desperate to get out there and kick a football, and that’s a great thing. England appear to be enjoying their role as the tournament’s outsiders. Spirit and strength has seen them this far. Now we’ll see if this team has something extra special. Katie Gornall, BBC News, Edmonton. And you can see the match live here on BBC One, kick-off is at midnight. Sir Nicholas Winton, the man who saved hundreds ofjewish children from the Nazis, has died at the age of 106. On the eve of the Second World War, he arranged for trains to carry jewish children from occupied Prague to safety in Britain, and then kept quiet about his immense contribution for half a century. Nick Higham has been looking back at his life. He was a modest sort of hero, 105 when the Czech Republic were detained its highest honour last year, watched by some of those he had hoped to save. He wasjust 28, a stockbroker planning a skiing holiday, when a friend suggested he go to Prague. The Nazis had invaded Czechoslovakia, the capital was full of refugees. Nicholas Winton organised trains to take jewish children to safety, the Kinderstransport, and found them homes in Britain. Somebody wrote and said they wanted to go, we sent them a picture of seven girls, about seven, and said it, choose one. Not the kind of way one would normally try and save a human, but it worked very well, it was quick. Suzanne was one of those he saved. She reached London 76 years ago today. Her rescuer has been called the British Schindler. There is no comparison with Schindler, who albeit saved some jews, with Schindler, who albeit saved somejews, because he with Schindler, who albeit saved some jews, because he employed them in his factory, but he also made money out of them. Let’s face it, thatis money out of them. Let’s face it, that is the truth. Nicholas Winton had no of the truth. Nicholas Winton had no of TV a you are actually sitting next to Nicholas Winton. -- -- had no ulterior motive. In 198080 was reunited with some of those he had saved. He had kept quiet about what he had done until his wife and a scrapbook in their loft. But even Nicholas Winton couldn’t help everyone. Eight Kinderstransport trains left Prague, a ninth was stopped the day that war was declared. All 250 on board later vanished. Sir Nicholas Winton, who saved hundreds ofjewish lives, who has died at the age of 106. That is all from us. Now on BBC One, it’s time for the news where you are. Good evening, I’m Asad Ahmad. So one big story affecting our city today, and it’s caused a massive split in the emotions and opinions of Londoners. The recommendation from the Airports Commission - that Heathrow should have a third runway. Whatever the commission decided, it was never going to be popular- as politicians and the owners of our two major airports are as split over what to do, as those living near the flight paths. But what of those people and communities who stand to be effected and possibly lose their homes and livlihoods? Here’s our political correspondent Tim Donovan reports. This is Longford a village benefits from but also plighted but its noisy neighbour. They come in close here. It’s more or less confirmation that we are going to go. This is the landlady at the local pub, 84 years old. She got a letter from Heathrow this morning saying she may are to sell her home. She and others fought hard against plans five years ago. She admits she’s worn down. I am pleased about it. If there is any money to come I will have the money and run. Do you think other people feel like that? Most of them, yeah. Because they’ve all had enough of living here really. The third runway would mean more than 700 homes being demolished, including Margite’s. I think it ought to go to Gatwick. We have enough terminals here now. You know, where will it end? Will they build a fourth runway? But some people don’t mind this at all. For Edie the more planes overhead the better for business. A lot of staff members from Heathrow when they finish their shifts they come for a coffee or beer or a drink and I ask them are you busy, if they’re busy, I know I am going to be busy. It’s all one thing to another. Dedesigned to make this new runway north-west of the existing ones more Pattialable are conditions such as no night flights, legal limits on noise and air pollution, and a law ensuring no 4th runway. But Heathrow are delighted saying this will be a huge boost to the economy. What we are trying to be is fair and we are trying to minimise the impact wherever we possibly can and then provide fair compensation where we can’t. No soothing words will convince Tory MP Zach Goldsmith. Doors from his constituency office we found a business excited by the benefits expansion could bring. I live in this area and the flight path, as well. They come straight over me. It doesn’t really bother ",,

Greece has a ""major trust issue"" according to European ministers discussing a possible debt bailout. Suspicion clouds intensive talks in Brussels, as efforts continue to try to avert a Greek exit from the Euro. Credibility is very low. And so, we will see. I am always constructive and optimistic and I hope a Grexit will not take place. Serbia’s Prime Minister flees bottles and rocks from a jeering crowd at a ceremony for the Srebrenica massacre 20 years ago. Did she do it? Yes she did, Serena Williams wins her sixth Wimbledon title. COMMENTATORZ Hi COMMENTATOR: Hi one, who wants it? Root is underneath this, and he makes no mistake. And England pull off a convincing win in the first Test against Australia to go 1-0 up in the Ashes. Good evening. Eurozone finance ministers are continuing to debate whether Greece’s new reform proposals qualify the country for a third debt bailout. The talks were described earlier by the German finance minister as ""extremely difficult,"" with the head of the Eurogroup saying there was a ""major issue of trust"" with Greece. Tomorrow, a full summit of EU leaders will meet, with this weekend seen as the final opportunity for a deal, without which Greece could leave the Euro. Chris Morris reports now from Brussels. What exactly is he walking into? Greece’s finance minister arrived in Brussels knowing his country’s economy is hanging by a thread. And it’s clear that his government’s latest proposals to its creditors are by no means a done deal. I think we’re here to make a lot more progress. These finance ministers must have lost count of the number of times they’ve had to meet in the last few weeks to talk about Greece. But now they have to make a decision. Without some kind of green light this weekend, Greece will slide into bankruptcy. And one senior official told me the chances of success are roughly 50-50. Greece is asking for a third bailout worth more than 50 billion euros. Although its creditors say it needs even more than that. It also wants its huge debt burden to be restructured, and it expects significant aid from the rest of the EU to help promote much-needed economic growth. But first it has to get its proposals for tough economic reforms and budget cuts approved. They had been seen as broadly positive. But the rest of the Eurozone and looks set to ask for more, and opinion at the very top is divided. Germany’s finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, said it would be extraordinarily difficult to make progress. He complained of a complete loss of trust. Others are anxious to avoid what could be a greater crisis if Greece were to go bust. And possibly leave the single currency. I think that they have to put forward a list of reforms. Credibility is very low. And so, well, we will see. I’m always constructive and optimistic. And I hope that a Grexit will not take place. And in Athens, they know their immediate future will be decided in Brussels. So they wait and watch and they wonder above all if and when their banks will reopen. I think if there is a deal, they will reopen very soon. It will be a quick process as long as the deal is there and the refinancing mechanism is put in place. But at the end of another long day, Europe still has to decide whether it is prepared to pay the price for saving Greece. There are those who argue that letting it go could cost even more. This is not just about the future of Greece but the future of the euro, too. Chris is in Brussels for us now. Sounds like there may be more complications tonight? Yes, this was never going to be easy. It looks like finance ministers will meet well into the early hours. They are drawing up lists of extra demands they want to make an Greece, things like labour market reform, possibly a specific list of legislation they want the Greek parliament to pass in the next few days as evidence that they actually mean business. There have also been other developments this evening from different countries sticking out different positions. Finland, for example, has said that its government has no mandate to agree to any extra debt relief for Greece, and the Italians on the other hand have said they will come in tomorrow when there is an EU summit and in tomorrow when there is an EU summitand demand summit and demand a deal is done for the sake of European unity. At the moment it is simply too close to call. More than 2,000 British tourists are expected to fly home from Tunisia over the course of the weekend after the Foreign Office changed its travel advice and urged all British citizens to leave the country immediately. Tourism forms a vital part of Tunisia’s economy, and the attack that killed 38 tourists two weeks ago has left the industry reeling, as Orla Guerin reports. The empty beach-front in the resort town of Hammamet, overlooked by empty hotels. Among them the A-star Chich Khan which relies on British tourists. Instead of the usual 600 guests, the front office manager says there are fewerthan 30. This hotel have I2 years open. I have worked with tourism 18 years and I haven’t seen like this. If the British do not come back, can this hotel remain open? No. Prices have been slashed and most of the staff sent home. The head of entertainment is still here, just about, with his Tunisian flag tattoo. No chance for all Tunisia if they do not come. He shows me letters written by departing British visitors. He’s ready lost one job this year, after the attack on the Bardo Museum in Tunis. He’s worried for his country and for himself. Well, the hotel already looks deserted and by tonight the last of the British tourists will be gone from here. Reluctantly, they say, they’ll be following the initial they’ll be following the official advice from London. But there is confusion over the fact that European governments have not been speaking with one voice about the risks of visiting Tunisia. Christine Dunne, from Essex, on holiday with her daughter Megan, thinks the government may have overreacted. There’s German here, there’s French here, they’re allowed to stay, they’re not being sent home. It’s just the English that have been sent home, and Ijust really don’t understand why. Then Megan broke down. They haven’t got a job after today. Concerned about the staff they are leaving behind. Reclining nearby, Belgian tourists who plan to stay another fortnight. But at the airport in the nearby town of Enfidha, crowds of British holiday- makers were checking in for flights home. By tomorrow night, all those on package tours are expected to be back in the UK, where the threat level is the same as Tunisia. The Serbian Prime Minister was forced to flee an event remembering the Srebrenica massacre. After being pelted with stones by an angry mob. The ceremony was taking place to mark the killing during Bosnia’s Civil War of 8000 Muslim men and boys by Bosnian Serb soldiers, 20 years ago. Serbia’s Prime Minister said he came to Srebrenica to extend the hand of friendship on the 20th anniversary of the massacre. Some Bosnian Muslims aren’t ready to accept that. They responded with boos, bottles and stones, as Aleksandar Vucic made a swift exit from the cemetery. There’s still a lot of anger here in Srebrenica over Serbia’s refusal to acknowledge what happened here as genocide. This sign is directed toward Serbia’s Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic, reminding him of what he said when he was in the Milosevic government in the 1990s. ""For the life of one Serb, we take 100 Muslims"", it says. The early 90s was a bloody time in Bosnia. It had long been a harmonious multiethnic society, but as Yugoslavia disintegrated, nationalist leaders sparked a Civil War. At the heart of the commemoration, the burial of more than 100 victims of the massacre. The remains were deliberately scattered across multiple gravesites. But advanced DNA testing has enabled identification. At the trials of some of the men responsible that may help with the painfully slow reconciliation process. But many Bosnian muslins say that can’t happen until everyone admits what happened here was genocide. Charities will have to draw up written agreements showing how vulnerable people will be protected from being pressurised to give money, under plans released by ministers today. David Cameron said the actions of some fundraisers were damaging the reputation of the charity sector. Our Political Correspondent Ross Hawkins reports. And how many years have you been doing this? 70 years. For more than 70 years, Olive Cooke sold poppies. She died aged 92, exhausted, according to a friend, by requests for money from other charities. Although she is thought to have taken her own life, her family said the letters she was sent by fundraisers weren’t a factor in her death. But now the law will change. Stuart Hemmings knew Olive. Like her he made a donation, and like her he was repeatedly pursued for money afterwards. If I’d have known that by signing up for this one little charity that it was going to cause such heartache, and it is heartache, because we can’t help them... I wouldn’t have done it in the first place. And then everybody would have lost. In future, contracts between charities and fundraisers will have to say how they’ll protect vulnerable people. And after high-pressure call centre tactics were exposed in the press, charities accept change is needed. Quite clearly from the public outcry and the enormous amount of media exposure from the public with regard to poorfundraising practice, this has to be a good thing. But Olive wouldn’t have wanted her name involved in a campaign that would cut the money charities received, her granddaughterjessica Dunn told me this evening. Ministers can’t know whether charities bore any of the responsibility for the death of Olive Cooke, but David Cameron is certain some fundraisers have been behaving unacceptably, and there could be yet tighter regulation to come. With all the sport here’s Lizzie Greenwood Hughes at the BBC Sport Centre. Thanks very much Rita. Good evening. England have comfortably beaten Australia to win the first Ashes test. They won by 169 runs, bowling them all out with a day to spare. joe Wilson reports from Cardiff. BY By 7pm in Cardiff, optimism had reached raucous levels. We’re going to win 5-O!

When Alastair Cook help this catch to get rid of Brad Haddin, he knew it was his day. Only Mitchell johnson held up England. Man of the matchjoe Root then inevitably johnson held up England. Man of the match joe Root then inevitably came back into proceedings, taking the wicket ofjohnson, and completing England’s day as a fielder. His catch, Australia 242 all out. Maybe Cardiff would have enjoyed a fifth day of the test for the spectators. But basically for England this was a match where everything went to plan. Is that your best test as a captain, do you think? To be honest, that’s irrelevant for me. It was about the other ten guys and how they performed. We stuck to our guns with our plans. We changed a little bit. But you’ve got to have the bowlers to be able to do that. You win it in five Test matches, not for days, but England have radically altered their Ashes image, here. Serena Williams has won her 6th Wimbledon title and 21st Grand Slam. The American’s staight sets victory over the spirited Spaniard Garbine Muguruza means she now holds all four majors at the same time, her second so-called ‘Serena Slam’. Andy Swiss has been following the action from Centre Court. Leaping into the record books. At 33 the oldest grand slam champion of the open era, surely one of the greatest. Yet Serena Williams’s day was also her opponents. Fearless and seemingly nerveless. From 4-2 down, Williams won nine of the next ten games, powering herway Williams won nine of the next ten games, powering her way to the brink of glory. Still, though, Muguruza was not finished, as she launched a thrilling comeback. The crowd on their feet. thrilling comeback. The crowd on theirfeet. But their feet. But Williams kept her composure and the result was history. COMMENTATOR: And she’s done it! She now holds all four major titles on a day of tears on one side and triumphed on the other. A Serena slammed, it’s happened! I can’t believe I’m standing here with another Serena slam. You guys helped me get through it. I heard you saying I love you, I love you more. A 21st grand slam title for Serena Williams, nowjust three short of the all-time record. Hopes today of a British champion ended in disappointment. Watched by his brother Andy, jamie Murray was in action in the doubles final. But he and his Australian partnerjohn Pearce were beaten byjohnjulian Roger and Horie at cow in straight sets. Great Britain’s Chris Froome still holds the leader’s yellowjersey after Stage 8 of the Tour De France. The 2013 winner has an 11 second overall advantage, just over a third of the way through the world’s toughest cycle race. The Frenchman Alexis Vuillermoz won the stage in Brittany. And that’s the sport. You can see more on all of today’s stories on the BBC News Channel. That’s all from me, good night. Good evening. We had sunshine on Centre Court today. Not quite so straightforward for tomorrow’s men’s final. The latest rainfall picture picking up heavier rain to parts of western Scotland pushing further inland towards England and Wales. Through the night tonight, rain and showers, could be quite heavy at times. Plenty of cloud across the country with breezy conditions. All in all not an especially cold night, with temperatures starting at 14 to 15 on Sunday morning. And starting Sunday morning on a fairly cloudy note. Rain to parts of East Anglia, Southern counties of England. That will clear away into the afternoon slowly and further north after a cloudy start we will see some brighter skies with sunshine into the afternoon. Potential for some light well scattered showers in parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland but many places staying dry and find into the afternoon. Plenty of sunshine across northern England, temperatures of 20 to 21 degrees. Steadily brighter spells developing for Southern counties of England but that might trigger the odd shower, potentially heavier through southern Wales, South Midlands and into East Anglia. Can’t rule out the thunderstorm and showers not too far away from Wimbledon. Towards Monday and Tuesday it is looking fairly cloudy. Temperatures generally in ",,

The Foreign Office has advised more than 3,000 British nationals to leave Tunisia as soon as possible, but some are angry. The Tunisian people are incredible. All they did was hug us, apologise, they all were crying, blaming themselves for what happened.

Critics say the new laws could mean more neighbour disputes. Good evening. Thousands of holidaymakers are leaving Tunisia after the British Government warned that another terror attack is highly likely. The Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond, said the Government now had a better picture of the emerging scale of the threat and it was too big a risk for Britons to stay in the country. It comes two weeks after a gunman killed 38 tourists in Sousse - most of them British. Denmark and Ireland have now also advised their citizens to leave. Our correspondent Orla Guerin is in Tunisia. Most Britons have been departing from the airport here. We had three flights today. We are expecting about a dozen more over the weekend. That will bring the British tourist trade here to an end, at least for now. Although the Foreign Secretary says that will be kept under review. Tourism is, orwas, a lifeline here and Tunisians are now bracing themselves for layoffs and hotel closures. You can have the pool all to yourself. At this four-star hotel in Hammamet, we found a lot of empty chairs and idle and anxious staff. There are just a handful of British tourists here and they are not happy about being sent home. Especially those whojust arrived. about being sent home. Especially those who just arrived. Like those whojust arrived. Like Heidi Barlow from Derbyshire. We have been here a couple of days. We arrived on Wednesday. We are disappointed we have to leave so early and also why were we not told beforehand? Why did they let people can come out to holiday. Darren Blackery was enjoying a last dip in the pool, but worrying about the staff, hit hard by news of the departures. Everyone’s faces have dropped. There’s not a lot of people here, as it is. The way they look at it, they need the tourism. They will be out of a job. They have all got families to support. They need the tourism in Tunisia to keep them living. But already on the golden sands nearby, police outnumbered holidaymakers. police outnumbered holidayma ke rs. The police outnumbered holidaymakers. The authorities here are afraid this is the new image of Tunisia’s tourist industry - is the new image of Tunisia’s tourist industry - a virtually deserted beach. Tunisia’s Prime Minister insists everything possible was done to protect British tourists. He admits there were short comings with security and says there is still a threat. In Vienna, the Foreign Secretary defended the new travel advice and the time it took toissue travel advice and the time it took to issue it. We’ve got a lot of people on the ground working with the Tunisians. We now have a much better picture of the emerging scale of the threat, as well as a better understanding of the mitigations that the Tunisians have put in place. We have had to make the decision that it is too big a risk to continue allowing British tourists to travel in Tunisia. And here a reminder of the risk - tourists to travel in Tunisia. And here a reminder of the risk - in this footage, filmed by a Czech tourist, casually strolling on the beach, gun in hand - tourist, casually strolling on the beach, gun in hand - the killer, who massacred almost Ao tourists. Two weeks on, the British exodus is well under way. Although plenty of holidaymakers said they didn’t want to go and give into terrorists. Some flights have already landed back in the UK. Many coming home with concern and gratitude for the people of Tunisia. The Tunisian people are incredible. All they did was hug us. Apologise. They were crying, blaming themselves for what happened, because obviously they are all Muslim and they feel like they have taken the blame for what has happened, when it is not their fault. what has happened, when it is not theirfault. Britain has been accused of playing into the terrorist hands by emptying the beaches. One senior Tunisian official says jobs beaches. One senior Tunisian official saysjobs and official says jobs and hope will be lost and there’ll be more room for the extremists. Our security correspondent, Frank Gardner, is at the Foreign Office now. Why has this decision been taken now, two weeks after the attack? ~ Ican I can see it must be incredibly annoying and frustrating for all the people - annoying and frustrating for all the people - particularly those who had already booked after the attacks. The reason is that it’s taken all of this time for British investigators, thatis this time for British investigators, that is police, Security Service, counter-terrorism and intelligence cou nter-terrorism and intelligence officials counter-terrorism and intelligence officials to work with the Tunisians and make a sober, detailed assessment of the threat. They didn’t want to do a knee-jerk reaction immediately after it. The threat they have come up with, that they have decided is that Tunisia is tonight facing a serious and credible threat from a partially dismantled terrorist cell, meaning they have accounted for some of it - obviously the gunman is dead. They are convinced he had accomplices and they are still at large. They probably have access to weapons and they have to assume there are people of the same mind set of him looking to target more westerners. Now, the light at the end of the tunnel is that there are security officials staying behind in Tunisia to help that country rebuild its security apparatus, with the view to lifting advice, so British tourists can go back, hopefully in a few months’ time. The funeral ofjim and Ann McOuire, who were killed in the attack in Tunisia two weeks ago, has taken place at the church where they worshipped in Cumbernauld. Their family and friends paid tribute to them at the service and said they would be sorely missed. Politicians in Greece are debating their government’s latest proposals to try to solve the debt crisis - and to secure a third bailout. Greece is asking for more than 50 billion euros in return for a commitment to raise taxes and reform pensions. But so far, the proposals have received a mixed reaction from eurozone countries. Our chief correspondent, Gavin Hewitt, is in Athens. Tonight in Athens, the chants of protestors who feel betrayed. These people believe that the Government of Alexis Tsipras, in its latest proposal, has made too many concessions to its creditors and Europe’s leaders in the hope of winning a third bailout. The Greek Prime Minister swept into Parliament, having sent off his plan to Brussels, offering more cuts and tax increases. He managed a smile, but he is struggling to persuade his own party that he had not sold out. The measures are not pleasant, but are considered necessary, said one of the Government MPs - are considered necessary, said one of the Government MPs - the big success is that we are starting to talk about Greek debt, which is not sustainable. In the queues at the ATM machines there is some bewilderment, with people questioning how the Government can propose tougher measures days a. The country voted no to further austerity. So, what are the latest Greek proposals? Firstly, pension reforms - are the latest Greek proposals? Firstly, pension reforms - phasing out early retirement. Increasing VAT rates on restaurants, hotels and catering and a commitment to privatise ports and airports. This is a small private hotel. Now, they will have to shoulder steep VAT increases. Frankly, Idon’t will have to shoulder steep VAT increases. Frankly, I don’t know if we will be here next year. This is how bad it is. At the moment, we just survive. These Greek proposals ma I be unpopular, but they are intended to persuade European leaders that the country is serious about reform. The early signs are the Greek proposal will be received positively by the creditors and by Europe’s leaders. The French, who had a significant influence on this proposal were the first to come out and support it. TRANSLATION: The Greeks have just shown the determination to want to stay in the eurozone because the programme they are presenting is serious and credible. Meanwhile, there are increasing signs of a country facing economic collapse, 5,000 containers at this port cannot be unloaded. No-one can PHY port cannot be unloaded. No-one can pay the tax to release them because the banks are closed. Inside the Greek Parliament, the Prime Minister has secured the backing of opposition parties for his latest proposal. There is strong resistance from the left of his own party. Hours before a weekend, that will determine Greece’s future. Tomorrow -i-oITIOI’I’oW pI’opoS8l detail at a meeting of the finance minutesters. It will be studied again at a full European summit on Sunday. This could turn out to be one of the most important meetings in the history of the European Union, or it could decide whether Greece stays or leaves the euro. We learnt today that both France and Italy believe this Greek proposal is credible. Who we didn’t hear from was the Germans and theirjudgment could turn out to be all important. The Chief Constable of Police Scotland, Chief Constable Sir Stephen House, has apologised to the families of a couple who lay for three days in a crashed car despite it being reported to police. john Yuill died in the accident and Lamara Bell was seriously injured. Police Scotland said the incident was ‘an individual failure’ that the force ‘felt most profoundly’. Comedian Freddie Starr has lost a damages case against a women who accused him of groping her when she was 15. Ajudge at the High Court said he believed Karin Ward’s claim she was assaulted by Starr at the BBC in 1974. Starr was investigated by police but not charged with any offences due to a lack of evidence. He now faces a substantial legal bill. The Government says it wants a further relaxation of planning laws in England to encourage more house building. Developers could get automatic planning permission to build on disused industrial land, so-called brownfield sites. The proposals are part of a wider Government plan to boost Britain’s productivity. Here’sjohn Moylan. Taking shape near Birmingham, a huge new development. Rover cars were once built here. Soon there could be up to 2000 houses. But according to the Business Secretary, who was touring the site today, it has been too difficult to get projects like this off the ground. The UK has long been incapable of building enough homes to keep up with growing demand. The decline in house building is nothing new. It’s been going on for decades. Last year we completed under 120,000 new homes. Figures today showed new house-building fell by 5.8% in May, the sharpest decline in four years. But the Government wants to see more than 200,000 built each year. So it’s overhauling the planning system, targeting brownfield sites like this one in south London. It was once a greyhound racing track. Soon it will be home to hundreds of workers and families. To prevent more sites like this from going to the dogs, the Government wants there to be automatic planning permission for this sort of development. Ministers will be given more powers to seize disused land, and some major housing projects could even be fast tracked. Why the changes? Because a shortage of housing can damage the wider economy. This doesn’t just frustrate the ambitions of hard-working people who want to own their own home. It also harms productivity and restricts flexibility in the labour market. While some industries are productive, in general our output per worker lags behind that of countries like France and Germany. The planning reforms are the centrepiece of measures which it is claimed will fix the foundations of the economy. Some aren’t convinced. Building more homes can lead to productivity increases in construction and it will have a tiny effect on productivity overall. But 50,000 homes is not going to change for prices, not going to change for tensions in the economy. The Local Government Association claims planning isn’t the problem, it’s the cost of transforming these brownfield sites. Reversing the long-term decline in house building will take hard graft. john Moylan, BBC News. The film star Omar Sharif has died at the age of 83. He was propelled to international fame by his role in Lawrence of Arabia and went on to star in Dr Zhivago as well as many other films. He died of a heart attack in hospital in Egypt. He’d been suffering from Alzheimer’s disease. David Sillito looks back at his life. There simply could not have been a better screen entrance. The film was Lawrence of Arabia, the man in the distance, Michel Shalhoub, an Egyptian Catholic of Lebanese descent. This is my well. His father was appalled that he had become an actor and so he had chosen a new name, the word for noble in Arabic, Sharif. Omar Sharif. You will not attack with any great success. The star of Egyptian film became a leading man in the age of the Hollywood epic. Better to lose face than your head. You know, you often look at me as though you knew me. I have seen you, four years ago, Christmas Eve. And when David Lean was looking for a Doctor Zhivago and Peter O’Toole turned the role down, he turned to the former co-star. He sent me a marvellous letter. He likes my poetry. The films became a way of supporting his real passion, cards. Bridge is what gives me real pleasure and I’d rather be playing bridge than filming, that’s quite true. He became the world’s most famous bridge player. He had, afterall, studied maths before training at Rada. He loved a puzzle. He also loved to gamble. I have lost up to... I mean, it’s obscene. I don’t like to say them, because I feel very guilty pronouncing such words. But huge amounts. I mean, hundreds of thousands of dollars, in one night, which is a lot. To the insanity of governments. But as the years went by, the films got worse, the debts got bigger and the playboy lifestyle began to pall. I had become, to my eyes, a useless person who played cards all the time and went racing and lived a sort of dissolute life, in my opinion. The devil-may-care charm was both a blessing and curse. Even on his first night in Hollywood, he and Peter O’Toole had managed to get arrested. There was always a glint, a touch of danger behind the liquid brown eyes of Omar Sharif. Omar Sharif, who’s died at the age of 83. 75 years ago today, the RAF launched attacks against German fighter aircraft off the English coast. It was the beginning of what became known as the Battle of Britain, the first significant Allied victory against the Nazis. Today, Spitfires and Hurricanes flew over Buckingham Palace to mark the anniversary. The Queen and other members of the Royal Family watched on from the balcony, as Nick Higham reports. They were changing the guard at Buckingham Palace this morning but the uniforms were not Brigade of Guards red, but the blue of the RAF. Winston Churchill famously called them ""the few"", the young fighter pilots who scrambled daily to attack enemy planes in the summer of 1940. It was the RAF’s equivalent of the Navy’s Trafalgar, or the Army’s Waterloo, a decisive victory which changed the course of history. A battle fought in the sunny skies over the English Channel and southern Britain to forestall a threatened German invasion. Paul Farnes was 21. He flew Hurricanes and shot down more than a dozen enemy planes. I felt completely confident the whole time. I never... I was never afraid. I never was apprehensive, really. Slightly apprehensive occasionally, but never much. jeffrey Wellan was 19 and flew Spitfires against a determined enemy. They weren’t doing this for fun. They mea nt business. And therefore it was deadly serious. And the constant bombing and mortal combat and the fear of invasion are very real indeed, believe me. Today, they were among six members of a diminishing band of veterans who watched a commemorative fly-past from the forecourt of Buckingham Palace. The Queen and other members of the royal family were on the balcony, as the RAF’s Battle of Britain flight came down the Mall. First came three Spitfires and between them a pair of Hurricanes, the less glamorous but equally effective workhorse of wartime Fighter Command. Afterwards, the veterans had lunch with the royals. There was a group photo, although an impatient Prince Philip lost his temper at the photographer’s delays. His grandson looked embarrassed, but the veterans had no doubt heard WOFSE. Today, their 21st-century successors joined in saluting them in the skies over London. Nick Higham, BBC News. A British corporate investigator, who’s been deported from China after being linked to a corruption case against the pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline, has spoken for the first time since he was released from prison. Peter Humphrey and his wife spent almost two years in jail. He told the BBC he’s shocked that he and his wife were imprisoned, while senior GSK staff convicted of more serious charges, were not. At the time the company was fined half a billion dollars, around £300 million. Here’s our China editor, Carrie Gracie. Peter Humphrey says it was a show trial for the cameras and that he and his wife, Yu Yingzeng, were collateral damage. They had become embroiled in a bigger drama, a corruption investigation at GSK. The British pharmaceuticals giant had bribed Chinese doctors to buy its medicines. The company paid a fine and the boss, who was convicted, did not go to prison. Now back home in Surrey, I asked Peter Humphrey why he and his wife did. I think it’s very simple. The answer is we don’t have, we didn’t have half a billion to pay the authorities. That story was about money from the beginning. Money got them into trouble, and money got him out. This story goes back to a series of anonymous allegations against GSK. With decades of China experience, Peter Humphrey was hired to investigate the source of these, and a secretly filmed sex video of GSK’s top boss in China. Even now, he’s reluctant to discuss any of this and is considering legal action. Initially the British consulate were more communicative than the Americans. A year ago, Peter’s teenage son, Harvey, showed me desperate prison from his parents, corporate investigators convicted of selling the personal data of Chinese citizens to their multinational clients. A miscarriage ofjustice, he says, which some could have helped overturn. It might be different in a different environment. But in the Chinese environment, people are very nervous about sticking their neck out on somebody else’s behalf. That’s disappointing. I guess it’s life in China. So how did he get through the ordeal of a crowded and squalid jail cell, separated from his wife and without desperately needed medical treatment? My wife and I were able to exchange letters through a very laborious procedure from time to time. And these letters showed been the strength of our love for each other. So I think what sustained me above all else was this knowledge of how strong our love was for each other. This kept us both nourished in the following months. But once the investigator, always the investigator. From a world away in rural England, Peter Humphrey is determined to work out exactly what triggered his two-year nightmare in Shanghai. Carrie Gracie, BBC News. Andy Murray has crashed out of Wimbledon after losing in straight sets to the seven-time champion, Roger Federer. He will now play his tenth Wimbledon final on Sunday against the world number one Novak Djokovic. Our sports correspondent Andy Swiss reports. It was a tale of frustration in the face of perfection. A day when Roger Federer rolled back the years with effortless elegance. At 33, Federer should be past his prime, but this was the very best at his very best. He seized the first set before Andy Murray stirred in the second, staving off five set points. For his wife, Kim, and mum, judy, something to shout about. But not for long. Federer making the sublime look almost ridiculously easy. The result was a straight sets masterclass. Federer, on course for a record eighth title here. Murray, beaten by brilliance. Ifelt like I played a pretty good match. It’s obviously disappointing that it’s finished here. But that’s the way it goes. Federer will play champion, Novak Djokovic, here on Saturday, after he beat Richard Gasquet. It’s still some final, just not the one the home fans hoped for. Andy Swiss, BBC News, Wimbledon. And in cricket, England have set Australia a record-breaking target of A12 if they want to win the first Ashes Test. England were bowled out for 289 in Cardiff this afternoon, with joe Root and Ian Bell putting the home side in a strong position with the bat, as Andy Swiss reports. Sometimes suddenly, quickly, you can read the same Test match very differently. So it came to pass in Cardiff that England took five Australian wickets inside an hour and a half on Friday morning. When Root and Anderson combined to get rid of Mitchell Starc, Australia were 308 all out. Well, Anderson has certainly done his bit. Now England’s batsmen had to back it up. England began their second innings with a lead of over 100 but when Lyth fell they were 73-3. Australia’s captain, Michael Clarke, keeps itjump on because he’s got a bad back. Imagine the catches he could take if he felt flexible. Most of the Australian exercise then became craning neck towards boundary, as Ian Bell batted him self back into form with 60. 60, as well, forjoe Root, a low score by his standards. England’s dominance was really demonstrated by tail-ender Mark Wood, almost hitting the ball into the River Taff. Australia will need to make A12 in their second innings to win, an Ashes record in anyone’s language. joe Wilson, BBC News, Cardiff. 55 years after she wrote her classic novel To Kill A Mockingbird, Harper Lee is about to publish another book. Already the most pre-ordered title since the final Harry Potter instalment, Go Set A Watchman returns to the fictional town of Maycomb, and follows the lives of the Finch family 20 years on. It will be Lee’s second published novel, but as Will Gompertz has been hearing, the writer did have plans to be far more prolific. Home was Maycomb County, a gerrymander some 70 miles long. This is an extract from Harper Lee’s Go Set A Watchman. A wilderness, dotted with tiny settlements. A story of racial tensions in the American South, set and written in the 1950s, but discarded by the author after the extraordinary success of her first novel, To Kill A Mockingbird. You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view. Atticus and his daughter, Scout, feature in both books. I went to New York to meet Harper Lee’s friend and one-time benefactor, joy Brown, who showed me a letter she had received from the author, known to all as Nell, in 1958, outlining her literary career plan. I have my work cut out for me for the next 15 years. One, race novel. Two, Victorian novel. Three, what Mr Graham Greene calls an entertainment. Four, I’m going to tear Monroeville to pieces. So she didn’t stop writing or thinking about all of a sudden, I’10 TT’IOI’â. What did she tell you, why she chose not to follow it up? Oh yes, she tried, but I think that when it really began to snowball and when it really snowballed to the top of the mountain, I wonder if it sneaked up on her after a while, whether it overwhelmed her. Were you not always, ""Come on, Nell, get your typewriter out""? No, because you don’t do that, somehow. And you’ve seen her recently. Yes, just last week. And how did you find her. She is obviously very deaf now. Yes, she is. And so what I wound up doing is you write out magic marker. She can speak and she thinks about what you’ve written. So that when she answers, she’s very specifically answering what you’ve written out. Is she happy about Watchman, or is she not completely aware? Oh, no, she is aware, she is very much aware. The fact that she can’t hear well, the fact that she can’t see all that well, has nothing to do with the fact that her brain isn’t running, I think, on full tilt. Has she read Watchman? She said she didn’t need to. She remembers it. joy Brown has read the book. She thought it lacked the literary subtlety of To Kill A Mockingbird, but that is unlikely to deter those who’ve waited in hope for decades to get an update from the Finch family. Will Gompertz, BBC News, New York. That’s all from us. Now, time for the news where you are. Welcome to BBC London News with me Victoria Hollins.

SOBBING Decision day for Greece as its parliament votes on whether to accept the tough new reforms demanded by the Eurozone. If MPs agree to the measures, it will mean a new bailout deal to keep Greece in the Euro. It comes as one of the country’s biggest creditors - the IMF - says it fears Greece will never be able to repay its debts. Also this lunchtime: A price cut for almost 7 million British Gas customers as household gas prices drop by 5 percent next month. A 94 year old former SS officer is jailed after being found guilty of facilitating mass murder at Auschwitz. The government sets out plans to toughen strike laws in the biggest shake up for decades. And giant hogweed - the plant being branded the most dangerous in Britain as a number of children are severely burnt after touching it. Later, on BBC London, had a capital’s toxic air is killing more people than previously thought. And the Chelsea football fans are suspected of an alleged racist attack fights in match ban. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC news at One. The Greek parliament must agree to reforms demanded by the Eurozone by tonight in order to secure another bailout. MPs will vote on the terms of the deal later today. But the vote comes amid fierce criticism from the International Monetary Fund. It says that even if Athens carries out the full austerity programme being demanded, it still won’t be able to pay back tens of billions of euros to its creditors. Our correspondent Mark Lowen is in Athens. Thank you very much indeed. After those bruising bailout talks, Alexis Tsipras faces his first big test today, to rush legislation through Parliament behind me and made a dangerous rebellion in his own Parliament. The majority of the governing party’s Central committee say they are opposed to the agreement. Meanwhile, social unrest has returned to the streets. Greeks will not take this deal lying down. Fighting a deal which they call the death of Greece. Here at being backed into a corner by creditors, forced to accept measures that they rejected in a referendum. Strikes hit public transport across the country. Businesses closed amid fear of what is to come. TRANSLATION: It is unthinkable that I would stay home while my wallet is empty. I have worked and I have not stolen from anybody. TRANSLATION: We work at hospitals. They there are already shortages and the problem will get worse when measures like this are fermented. MPs used to lead protest against austerity and now they are putting it through. Pension reforms and tax hikes must be passed today but several coalition members will rebel. The Prime Minister will have to rely on opposition support. It is hard to convince the -- to rely on opposition support. It is hard to convince the -- dissenters when Alexis Tsipras told TV that the deal was forced upon him TRANSLATION: I accept my responsibilities for mistakes, and the responsibility for signing a text that I do not believe in but that I am obliged to implement. Even from some creditors, little believe that it will work. Last night, the IMF made a damning report public. Greece’s debt can now only be made sustainable through debt relief measures that go far beyond what Europe has been willing to consider so far, it says. Alexis Tsipras faces pressure in parliament and on the streets but polls show that the majority want him to stay on as Prime Minister. They give him credit for fighting for Greece, even though he lost. It is unlikely that he will be forced out, but will he choose to stay on and implement measures he fundamentally does not endorse? That is less clear. Cue furious debate at the governing party’s radio station. Callers are desperate for questions about the austerity. Those answering have almost become therapists. TRANSLATION: I have said, angry people calling in. They feel betrayed. But most are calm. They are rallying behind Alexis Tsipras because he gave us hope. Venting frustrations, it is cathartic for sure, but Greeks know they have had a gun held to their heads and for now there is little way out. More protests will gather here tonight as parliament prepared to vote on the measures. But there is a growing sense that no sign agrees on the viability of this deal. Neither Alexis Tsipras, the IMF or Germany, whose Finance Minister says that many ministers they would prefer a Greek exit to the Eurozone. But they will push on regardless, even if we will be back here again in a few months’ time. Our Europe correspondent Chris Morris is in Brussels. We’re not in the Eurozone, but could Britain end up funding some of the bill for Greece? That’s right. There is a big problem with short-term financing for Greece. They have big debt repayments in the next few days and this third bailout has not yet begun being negotiated. The European Commission has decided to use a fund called the ESFN, which all European states contribute to. They say that is the only option to prevent Greece going bust. They are aware that countries outside the Eurozone are not happy with this and they say they are looking at ways to avoid those countries, including Britain, taking responsibility financially if those loans do not get repaired. But for the government, there is also a political problem. The Prime Minister thought that five years ago he had a cast-iron guarantee that this fund would not be used for any future rescue. Now it seems that the European Commission is saying that is not the case. So even if Britain does not actually get involved in guaranteeing any of these loans over the next few days, there will be critics of the Prime Minister who say, you see the promises you get from Brussels, they can never be kept. British Gas is cutting household gas prices by five per cent from the end of August. It will lead to an average saving of £35 on annual energy bills. It’s the company’s second reduction this year. Our industry correspondent john Moylan reports. When British Gas cuts prices, it impacts on households across Britain. It Leeds this morning, customers gave the news a cautious welcome. At least they are going the right way. Anything that is lower is good. If they can save the customers anything, it is brilliant. It would be better if they stop treating us, pretending they are giving us something when they are not bringing it down like they should do. The 5% cut will come into effect on August 27, in time for winter, knocking £35 of annual gas bills. That will benefit 6.9 million customers on standard and fixed tariffs. There is a new boss British Gas, so this move is evidence of a new strategy? We want to be competitive and offer good value. Want to retain the customers we have, that is important, but we also want to win new customers. Hundreds of thousands of new customers have joined us this year already. The move makes British Gas competitive on standard tariffs, although experts say that customers can still save money by switching to fixed-price deals. Consumer groups hope that the move could heap pressure on British Gas’s rivals to cut prices as well. Barely any price cut is good news for -- cut prices as well. Barely any price cut is good news for -- any price cut is good news for consumers. That is an indication that other suppliers will follow suit. But could British Gas have done more? There is no change to address the tariffs despite falls in the wholesale power market. The company claims that other parts of the bill have been rising. And it is likely to face scrutiny for the 5% cut in gas given the changes of global gas prices. Wholesale gas prices have fallen by 35%, and that is down to a couple of factors. A drop in the oil price, along with gas entering into Europe. And we also have new supply coming in in regions like Australia, which will eventually bring the supplied to the UK. Last week, a report found a lack of competition allowed the big six energy firms to overcharge customers. This price cut by British Gas may go some way to enter its critics. And john’s with me now. Are other companies likely to follow suit? History tells us that the big 610 tends to hunt in packs and when one moves, the rest move. Pressure growing on them to tell us that they need to cut prices. The industry is in the middle of a huge investigation by the competition authorities so there is pressure for downward prices in the weeks ahead. And I would expect us to hear more. For British Gas, there is a new boss at the top of Centrica, new boss at British Gas, and one wonders whether this gives the company a opportunity for a new strategy, and not these big moments once a year when they announced falls or rises and there is a big row, whether they may want to move to more flexible arrangements where they are changing prices more often. And this comes on the day that the National Grid has warned that the risk of blackout has increased since this time last year. This is the gap between the supply on the grid and the demand. This margin is going to drop to its lowest level in ten years this winter, so this issue of tight margins in the winter seems like it will be around for the next few years. The government has outlined its plans to toughen up the laws on strike action. Unions claim that the proposals will make it almost impossible to go out on strike. One of the requirements under the Trades Union Bill would be a 40% turnout of eligible union members in order for strike action affecting core public services - like health and transport - to go ahead. Here’s our political correspondent Robin Brant. This is what a strike looks like. Last week, a walk-out by rail workers caused problems in the West Country. At the same time, action underground in London led to chaos, but was it fair? The government wants to change the rules and make it tougher to go on strike. What we’re trying to do is to make striking more reasonable, with a fairer balance between the interests of unions and also the interests of people who rely on schools to be able to put their kids into so they can go to work, relying on public transport, so that they can get to theirjob on time. The big change is new thresholds. Turnout would have to be 50% of members affected to make a strike legal, and in core services like the NHS, at least 40% of all members would have to back it. Underthose rules, the of all members would have to back it. Under those rules, the tube strike last week would have gone ahead but the country’s top union leader thinks these changes will hurt millions. The government is looking to put all the powers in the hands of the employers at the effect of working people -- hands of the employers at the effect of working people -- the expense of working people. This is a nasty attack on the rights of working people, which will make it harder to defend jobs and services. Britain’s trade unions have 6 million members but they are not the force they once were. There were walk-outs over coalition cuts in 2011. The membership have declined -- coalition cuts in 2011. The membership have declined -- has declined since the field miners strike in 1984. Industrial action is at a historical low. There were more days lost to strikes in 1926 than in most of the 70s, 80s, 90s and 2000s. The reforms are notjust about striking and the power of the trade unions, it is also about the money they get from their members and how they choose to spend it. Ed Miliband change the rules. The trade unions still give Labour a lot of money, sometimes automatically. The Tories want to make members tick a box to opt in every year before that can happen. Whoever you are giving money to, it should be an act of free will. It should be a decision that you have to take. The money should not be sequestered away from you without being asked. It is a simple principle which is that it must be fair. What he is doing is one rule for the Labour Party, but something completely different for the Tories. The changes are the biggest two union law in 30 years. The proposals come at a vulnerable time for the Labour Party. Let’s speak to our assistant Political Editor, Norman Smith. MPs this lunchtime that this is about protecting the public. The reforms provoked a furious clash in the Commons but the man behind them, the Business Secretary, is an admirer of Mrs Thatcher. He has a picture of her on his office wall. That tells us a story because these are the most sweeping and radical reforms since Mrs Thatcher. But these are very different days. Mrs Thatcher came into power on the back of a winter of discontent with garbage in the streets, and she plunged into an epic strike with the National union of Mineworkers and steelworkers. Today, the unions are much reduced, tamed beasts. The levels of strikes is the lowest for a generation which is why Labour say this isjust a party a generation which is why Labour say this is just a party political attack to nobble the unions and nobble the Labour Party. Incidentally, all four Labour people trying to become the next Labour leader has said that they would reverse these changes. Mr Cameron’s argument, it is about looking after businesses and the public who are affected by strikes but do not get to vote on them. The critical question is where does the public stand, and here, but Mr Cameron and the Labour Party believe the public is on their side. Mr Cameron believes that people are fed up with strikes at schools and on transport and London Underground, and Labour take the view that Mr Cameron has overreached himself, by the scale of these reforms, and that they undermine his claim to be a1 nation government. But they cannot both be right. We simply do not know where the public stand. Unemployment has risen for the first time in more than two years. Official figures show the total rose by 15,000 between March and May, bringing the jobless total to 1.85 million. However regular pay also rose by 2.8 percent, that’s the highest rise in real terms for five years. Here’s our economics correspondent, Andy Verity. After years of expansion in every sector from construction to retail, to manufacturing, the jobs creation machine that is our economyjuddered to a halt in the spring with more people losing jobs than gaining them for the first time since early 2013. There are nowjust under 31 million people in work. That is down 67,000 compared with the previous quarter. A big part of the reason was that 131,000 fewer people declared themselves self-employed. There are a quarter of a million more people in work now than there were a year ago. So even though unemployment has ticked up more recently, employers will tell you it is a very tight labour market. They are having to take longer and longer to find the staff and pay them more and more. Pay rose by 2.8%, partly because employers like this Shrewsbury manufacturer have to compete to attract the staff they need for expansion. It is getting tough out there. We’re not the only manufacturing company that has seen the market improve. The sector is getting very competitive and skilled workers are harder and harder to find. And we put a lot of time and effort into training on-site. It is notjust about investing in plant, it is also in people. But it is notjust a shortage of skilled people to do skilled jobs. Even unskilled vacancies are proving difficult to fill. It seems that there is a shortage in every single sector and every region of the UK in the jobs market. So trying to find people in skilled roles, whether it is construction, engineering, IT, is difficult. But equally we are finding it difficult to find people as general labourers, office professionals, nurses, medicalstaff. It is every sector that we are finding there are skills shortages now. The economy did slow down earlier this year and now it looks like the jobs market may also be slowing. But for employers, if there is a problem with the jobs market, it is not too many people looking for work, but too few. Our top story this lunchtime. Decision day for Greece as its parliament votes on whether to accept the tough new reforms demanded by the Eurozone. And still to come. Who will win a ""wide open"" Open? Later on BBC London. We join the American Football stars putting a group of London pupils through their paces. And from bricklaying to choristers - the best of the London modern art scene is celebrated in a new exhibition at the Whitechapel Gallery. A former SS officer, known as the ""Book-keeper of Auschwitz"", has been found guilty of facilitating mass murder. A German court sentenced Oskar Groening, who’s 94, to four years in prison. Groening had the job of counting the money confiscated from prisoners as they arrived at Auschwitz. Our correspondent jenny Hill is in Berlin. Good afternoon from Lueneburg. This is the hometown of Oskar Groening at four month the court here has heard details from one of the darkest periods of world history. Oskar Groening was not a key player within the Nazi regime, nor did he physically kill anyone. Nevertheless the court here has ruled he did head -- help facilitate genocide. It is merely a lifetime since this man helped to kill 300,000 people. Today justice caught up with Oskar Groening. He was proud to be in the SS. Hisjob at Groening. He was proud to be in the SS. His job at Auschwitz, to count the money confiscated from prisoners as they arrived. Many were sent straight to the gas chamber. Amongst them this man’s parents. Leon survived Auschwitz, he is 94. The same age as Oskar Groening. I think the sentence is right. Can you forgive him? No. I cannot forgive. Because 30 members of my family were murdered. This is where they died. Auschwitz was described in court as a machine designed to kill human beings. Anyone who played a part in that Hashim is guilty of facilitating mass murder, the court said. This is a historical milestone. Thejudge said. This is a historical milestone. The judge said that Auschwitz in itself was a motor machine. And my clients have been waiting for the sentence their whole lives. There is huge public interest in this trial both here in Germany and overseas. And here is why. This is likely to be the last trial of its kind. Because Oskar Groening may be the last that the 2-faced justice for his crimes. For years injail for a man who said he wasjust following orders. A number of Auschwitz survivors gave evidence during this trial and the number of them expressed the desire to hear an apology from Oskar Groening. He is now told the court here he is truly sorry. In his own words, I can only now ask forgiveness from God. After a three billion mile journey that’s taken almost 10 years, an unmanned NASA spacecraft has hurtled past the planet of Pluto and sent a message to earth telling scientists that it survived its close encounter with the dwarf planet. Later today it’s expected to send back photographs - the first of their kind - which should reveal details of Pluto never seen before. Our science editor David Shukman sent this report from mission control in Maryland. A long anxious wait at Mission Control then suddenly, a few key words. Lock with carrier. That meant the spacecraft was in contact. And then came more. Stand by. A flow of data had started and everyone here just went wild. A mission to the very edge of the solar system was unfolding, just as planned. The scientists and engineers gathered to get the latest news were alljubilant. This isjust amazing. This is just amazing. You know, we actually had a rock band visit us a week or two ago. These are the rock stars! CHEERING. The spacecraft New Horizons was launched from Earth nearly ten years ago. And had travelled three billion miles towards Pluto. Grainy images of this distant world became sharper and sharper. The latest to come in showed a bizarre pattern of dark and pale terrain. What is now due to reach us should be far more revealing. CHEERING. What is being celebrated is a landmark in space exploration. And when the next pictures come in, we will all be witnesses to a moment of genuine discovery. David Shuckman, BBC News, at Mission Control in Maryland. Well let’s speak to our correspondent Rebecca Morelle who’s at mission control for us now. What the moment it will be when these photographs come down to earth. How soon do we expect? They will not be presented to the world for a few hours of the data from the spacecraft arrived back this morning and scientists have been busy assessing it. They are expecting something fabulous. If you thought the picture but came back yesterday was incredible, we have been promised that will be blown out of the water. We will have ten times more resolution in the images, we will see pictures like mountains possibly, craters, maybe even nitrogen flow, carbon monoxide ice. A real taste of what this place is like. And not only to but it’s large room also. We will be processing images of that which had been taken and that is unusual, the moon is almost the same size as Bhutto. It has a strange pole at the north end of it which is unusual for so scientists want to find out what is going on there. They were worried when I set out that Pluto could be quite dull and cold world but it is turning out to be at this, spectacular. And the promise that the images we get back later today should just been wonderful and we will get a real taste of what this world is like. With just a day to go until the start of the Open - the Old Course at St Andrews is ready to welcome some new rising stars. In its 144 year history it’s seen some memorable moments from jack Nicklaus in 1970 to Seve Ballesteros’s iconic victory in 1984 and the reign of Tiger Woods. But with Rory Mcilroy out on crutches - who are the favourites this year? Our correspondent Andy Swiss reports. Undergrey Under grey skies, the brightest star in goal. jordan Spieth on the practice range this morning, ready for a shot at history. A 21 jordan Spieth is already ripping up the record books. Winning the Masters this year and the US Open, now hoping to become the first man ever to take the first three majors of the year. A fact that he is trying his best to forget. When I step on the tee on Thursday I do not look at it as trying to win three in a row but trying to win the Open Championship at a very special place. The hardest thing will be forgetting about where you are because being here at St Andrews and looking at the past champions and who wins open Championships here, thatis who wins open Championships here, that is elite company. jordan Spieth says he has been preparing for St Andrews by practising on a golf simulator at home. But nothing can prepare you for the weather conditions. With rain and strong winds forecast later in the week, it could be some challenge. But it is a challenge without a champion. 12 months ago Rory Mcllroy lifted the claretjug. See you months ago Rory Mcllroy lifted the claret jug. See you at St Andrews? Sadly not.

When four days of drama is about the only guarantee. This is giant hogweed - and it’s been dubbed the most dangerous plant in Britain. So far this summer five children have suffered serious burns from the plant. It contains chemicals that diminish the body’s natural protection from UV light. Our correspondent judith Moritz has more. The Victorians imported it as a garden ornamental, but giant hogweed is a massive horticultural hazard. Its dainty white flowers give the wrong impression, this plant is poisonous. Its toxic sap dangerous to the touch. Reid Daley was playing in a patch of he plants. His skin burned and blistered and will remain sensitive to light foI’ SEVEFI VEBFS. I was in agony. It felt like every time I moved or touched something with it, it was like someone was poking me with a needle. It just would not stop. At its full height, you can see how tall giant hogweed is. Along this path, some of the stems have been treated with herbicide. You can see there that they’ve been killed. But the seeds spread so effectively that look, just here, yet more of it is popping up. Without a shadow of a doubt, it is the most dangerous plant in the UK. Now, this environmental campaigner is calling for more to be done to get rid of the giant hogweed. It needs to be a multiagency approach, directed by government. Because this is becoming such a huge problem. I mean, it was first reported ten, fifteen years ago. It is now highlighted because of these poor children in Glasgow, Salford, Bolton. And this is going to happen and happen again. Giant hogweed often grows near canals and rivers. Local councils have a duty to get rid of it, and landowners who deliberately cause it to spread can face hefty fines. judith Moritz, BBC News. Time for a look at the weather with john Hammond. Todayis Today is sent with state and as we all know if it does rain today it will rain for the next 40 days. The flip side, if it is dry today it will be dry for the next 40 days. It has no scientific basis whatsoever because some of us had the rain today and some had dry weather. In fact a cloudy and damp weather across the Southern counties is finally shifting. Things slowly beginning to brighten up. Some sunshine and temperatures already reaching 24 degrees in parts of Kent. Inland weather cloud persist, temperatures in the low 20s but the better sort of day. The odd shower around in parts of Northern Ireland and the East of Scotland but pretty isolated. And temperatures in the mid-to high teens, very pleasant indeed. Most places stay find through the evening. The odd shower lingering across the East of Scotland into the night.

Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. A former SS guard at the Nazi death camp Auschwitz has been found guilty of facilitating the murder of 300,000 people. 9li-year-old Oskar Groening was known as the ""bookkeeper of Auschwitz"". His job was to count the money confiscated from prisoners as they arrived at the camp. A court in Germany sentenced him to four years in prison at the end of what’s expected to be one of the last Holocaust trials. Our correspondent Caroline Wyatt is outside the court in Lueneburg. In this quiet, unassuming Germantown where Nazi forces surrendered to the British in May, 1945, the street was made again today when perhaps the last trial in the Second World War crimes returned its verdict. Today, Oskar Groening, now 94 was finally forced to live up to the consequences of his pa rt part in the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz. Guilty, the man known as the book-keeper of Auschwitz. Guilty, the man known as the book- keeper of Auschwitz, the book-keeper of Auschwitz, now frail and in the book-keeper of Auschwitz, now frailand in diminishing health. It has taken over 70 years, but at last Oskar Groening will pay the price of his crimes. This was him as a young man, proud to wear his SS uniform. From 1942 to 1944 he worked at Auschwitz, tending the money taken from the prisoners as they arrived. Most did not live for long ones inside these gates. Over a million people were killed at Auschwitz, most in the gas chambers, others from starvation or the bitter cold. Oskar Groening was tried for his part in the deaths of 300,000 jewish men, women and children deported from Hungary to be murdered here. Oskar Groening even spoke to the BBC in a documentary in 2005. He was unrepentant even when asked if it was fair to unrepentant even when asked if it was fairto him was fair to him that he had had a family and children while so many millions ofjewish families and others were killed. TRANSLATION: Absolutely not. Everybody is looking out for themselves. So many people died in the war, not onlyjews. So many things happened, so many were shot, so many snuffed it. People burned to death, so many were burned. If I thought about all of that, I would not be able to live one minute longer. Oskar Groening showed little emotion as he was sentenced to four years in prison as an accessory to the murder of 300,000 people. The verdict came so quickly and just one survivor was here in court to witness it. But many others welcomed the verdict and the factjustice had many others welcomed the verdict and the fact justice had finally caught UP the fact justice had finally caught up with one of the many thousands of SS men who worked to make Auschwitz possible. In those days... Susan Pollack wasjust13 possible. In those days... Susan Pollack wasjust 13 when possible. In those days... Susan Pollack was just 13 when she arrived at the death camp from Hungary. Somehow she survived, most of her family did not. She was one of 60 survivors who testified against Oskar Groening. Back at home in London today the verdict was a vindication. For me the message is he has been recognised and identified as a guilty person. He is a symbol. He is 94 years old and he is notjust standing in for himself, he is standing in for those many thousands, others who have escaped. Any trial, any kind of identification in what they were doing. This trial has raised questions about how German justice has dealt with the Nazis over the past decades. The German Federal office for the prosecution of Nazi crimes has a number of other suspects under investigation, but they are all extremely elderly men. Given how long these investigations take, the preparations for a trial, how long or of that takes, it is quite unlikely that any of these men in their 90s are actually going to appear in court. Oskar Groening never did say sorry, even as he faced his victims in court. He was, his lawyers argued, a small cog in the bigger Nazi machine. Oskar Groening himself said only his God would forgive him. Unemployment has risen for the first time in more than two years. New figures show a rise of 15,000 between March and May, bringing the jobless total to 1.85 million. But pay continues to rise with average weekly earnings up by 3.2% in the latest three-month period, the highest rise in five years. Our Economics Editor Robert Peston reports. The sparks and thuds of wealth creation - metal working in Shrewsbury. A company, Salop Design & Engineering, which can’t get enough skilled operatives to meet demand and doesn’t really understand today’s first national rise in unemployment for more than two years. I think it must be a short-term blip. I think manufacturing is very strong in the UK and I think it will continue to strengthen. We fell a long way back in the recession and so there is a lot of climbing to do. We are back to almost, almost where we were but there is still room to grow. And I think there’s a lot of other manufacturers that are continuing to grow as well. After the great crash of 2008, unemployment reached a peak greater than 8% of available workforce just under four years ago, and has been falling and falling since then. But this year, the rate ofjob creation has slowed considerably and gone into reverse, a bit. I think we see a combination of a short-term blip but also at the end of a long-term expansion in the labour market. So looking forward, we are going to see jobs coming back but nowhere near as strong as in the past. The striking trends are rising unemployment among women and a fall in the number of self-employed. But in most of the economy, employers complain theyjust can’t get the people. We see that there is a shortage in every single sector and every region of the UK in thejobs market. So trying to find people in skilled roles - whether construction, engineering, IT - is difficult. But equally we are finding it difficult to find people as general labourers, office professionals, nurses. And that’s an explanation for why pay is rising faster, after adjusting for inflation, than at any time since 2007. So here, at the Bank of England, they face something of a dilemma. Does the fastest rise in wages since before Northern Rock went down pose a threat that inflation will take off and therefore interest rates have to rise to ward that risk off? Or does the first rise in unemployment for more than two years show that the economy is slowing down and that, therefore, there’s no inflationary risk? This simultaneously hot and cold jobs market is something of a puzzle. Busy, busy worker bee. Lovely weather for making honey and money, but for how much longer may depend on how and when the Bank of England puts up interest rates. The Government has set out plans to make it harder for workers to go out on strike. Under the proposals, at least half of those affected would have to take part in a ballot before a walk-out could go ahead. In key public services, like transport and health, there would be an additional hurdle. At least 40% of those entitled to vote would have to support industrial action. Ministers say the proposals are about protecting the public, but unions say it’s a fundamental attack on workers’ rights. Here’s our Political Correspondent, Vicki Young. Congestion. Do not enter. Stations closed, commuters stranded. Roads gridlocked. This was the chaos caused by transport strikes in London and the West Country last week. Ministers want new laws to stop a small number of union members disrupting essential services. In future, this ferry strike in Ayrshire will be harder to organise. Unions say workers won’t be able to fight for their rights, but those who have had to deal with the fallout from strike action say it is time to get tough. They say it will stop people withdrawing their labour, a fundamental right, they say. Ido not think it will do that at all. People will always have the right to strike and to withdraw their labour. All we want to do is stop coercion by union leadership in getting people who do not want to strike, who are very often the majority, forced out onto the streets, not able to earn for that day and to cause a lot of disruption to everybody else. So what impact does industrial action has in Britain? Back in the 1970s and 1980s, a wave of strikes meant close to 30 million working days were lost in some years. Since then, walk-outs have become much rarer, although there was a slight increase in 2011 with protests over public sector pensions. The new strike rules include plans to allow agency staff to be brought in to cover for those on the picket line. Union leaders say it is an attack on workers. Much of this is counter-productive, it will impact upon industrial relations in such a negative way that we will spend more time talking about the legislation, how to get round it, how it is unfair, than actually dealing with the issues that are out there. And there is a sting in the tail for the Labour Party too. Union members will have to actively opt in for their membership fee to be paid into Labour coffers. It is not acceptable for him to be curbing funds from hard-working people to the Labour Party, while turning a blind eye to donations from hedge funds to the Tories! There is a very simple principle here. If you want to give money to a party, it should be an act of free will. Not something that is taken out of your pay packet without you being told about it properly! Ministers want to limit the kind of disruption that was seen across stations like this last week. And they firmly believe that the public is on their side in this battle. But there is politics in this too. The Conservatives want to make it awkward for Labour notjust over their union funding, but forcing them to speak out in favour of strike action. In Greece MPs are preparing to vote on whether to accept the terms of another bailout laid down by the eurozone by tonight. But the vote comes as the International Monetary Fund criticised the deal hammered out in Brussels on Monday. It says that even if Athens carries out the full austerity programme being demanded, it still won’t be able to pay back tens of billions of euros to its creditors. Our Europe Editor Katya Adler reports from Athens. This is judgment Day This isjudgment Day in a country thatis This isjudgment Day in a country that is virtually bankrupt. The Greek Prime Minister has promised to pass tough new laws by tonight in a cash for reforms deal with his mistrustful creditors. It is a very tall order and they know it. They are not the only ones who have lost faith. The shouts here today are of betrayal. Protesters are saying there Prime Minister has abandoned Greece, that a new deal with its creditors will mean hell to pay here. Betterto creditors will mean hell to pay here. Better to leave the euro, even the European Union now. Tonight’s vote in the Greek parliament is set to be stormy. The Prime Minister will rely on the opposition for support. Pension and VAT reform is an acceptable for many in his left wing party. The deputy Finance Minister has resigned in disgust. Why did you stand down? This cannot lead anywhere. That is in both Greece and Europe. It shows the end of not only us, but the end Europe is facing. So, the Greek government could fall and banks are empty and more austerity is guaranteed whether or not a new bailout deal comes off. But life and is little pick me ups go on. People here are actions but resolute. Our Prime Minister promised us something different from what he is doing, it is true, she told me, this country is bankrupt. But somehow I hope we will be OK. TRANSLATION: Today is important because of the vote in parliament. The crisis is all my clients talk about. Personally I do not trust politicians anywhere. Lack of trust is a recurring stumbling block in resolving the Greek crisis. It is splitting Europe as well with countries arguing over the terms and conditions of a rescue package and who should foot the bill. Tonight at the Greek parliament there is a fight over the bailouts deal that may never get off the ground. Our deputy political editor, james Landale, is in Westminster for us. And there are questions tonight over whether Britain could end up having to help Greece financially in the short term? That’s right, the European commission has proposed that a big part of EU cash should tide Greece overin part of EU cash should tide Greece over in the coming weeks. As it is EU money, Britain would be involved and potentially liable for £730 million if Greece does not pay the money back. The Prime Minister and Chancellor are not happy, they say tax-payers’ Chancellor are not happy, they say tax-payers’ money will not be put on the line to help bail out any Eurozone country. The problem is that they don’t have a veto on this. However I am told by Treasury sources that they are progressing towards a deal that would allow the British money to be ring fenced and protected if Greece did eventually default. The problem for the Prime Minister, Eurosceptic MPs say this breaches a deal he struck five years ago to ensure Britain has nothing to do with your bailouts. They say it bodes poorly for Mr Cameron’s reforms in the months ahead. Our top story this evening: 94-year-old Oskar Groening, known as ""the bookkeeper of Auschwitz"", is found guilty of being an accessory to the murder of 300,000 jews. And still to come: Can England win again? The second Ashes Test starts tomorrow. Later on BBC London: People in west London lose their battle to stop this viaduct being built, as their hopes for a tunnel instead get dashed. And the ‘art of bricklaying’. How the best of London’s modern art scene is celebrated in a new exhibition. Caught on camera by an unmanned Nasa spacecraft that’s travelled three billion miles to get there - this is the most detailed image ever seen of the planet Pluto. And there were celebrations at mission control this morning when the spacecraft sent a message to Earth telling scientists that it had survived its close encounter with the dwarf planet. Now scientists are waiting for even more detailed images of the last truly unexplored world in the solar system. Our science editor David Shukman is at mission control in Maryland. People are on the edge of their seats here, because this is a remarkable moment, potentially al-Anbar in the history of the exploration of space. There has never been a visit to such a distant world. -- potentiallya never been a visit to such a distant world. -- potentially a landmark. The check that it was working OK came at mission control. OK, we are in lock with carrier. Lock with carrier. The first confirmation of contact with the spacecraft. We have a healthy spacecraft. We have recorded data with the Pluto system. And we are outbound for Pluto. The scientist leading the mission, Alan Stern, was overjoyed. For years he has planned to explore Pluto, now it is happening. No-one knew if the spacecraft would survive flying right past Pluto. Three billion miles from Earth, this is just unknown territory. But everything performed exactly as planned and now we are all waiting to see what has been found. Among the scientists eager for results is Stephen Hawking. He recorded this message for the mission team. We explore because we are human. And we want to know. I hope that Pluto will help us on that journey. I will be watching closely and I hope you will too. As the mission has unfolded, our view of this distant world has been transformed. Pluto was once thought to be too icy and remote to be interesting. Now in the latest pictures we are discovering an active and rather puzzling world. Soon the artists’ impressions of Pluto, all we have had until now, will no longer be needed. Real close-ups are being transmitted through space right now. And we are on the brink of seeing them. What we expect in a little under two hours’ time is a new shot of the whole of Pluto. One of its largest moon. And then two or three close-ups of the service of Pluto which may reveal mountains and valleys. When they come in and we see them later, bear in mind that they were brought to you from the very edge of the solar system. British Gas is cutting household gas prices by 5% from the end of August. It will lead to an average saving of £35 on annual energy bills. It’s the company’s second reduction this year. Our industry correspondent john Moylan reports. In recent years, soaring iI’I I’âCâI’Il VEBFS, So8IâiI’Ig âI’IâI’gy prices have ignited a political row. The big six firms have been warned about overcharging. So could this price cut turn down the heat on British Gas? That’s what the UK’s biggest supplier will be hoping. In Leeds today, news of the price cut received a cautious welcome. £35 over a year isn’t a huge amount but at least they are going the right way. Anything that they can lower is good. Anyway they can save customers money is brilliant. I think it would be better if they stopped cheating us and pretending they are giving us something when actually they are not bringing it down like they should do. British Gas says 6.9 million gas customers will benefit, although those on fixed deals will not. For many, it will mean savings this year £72, including the price cut February. Taking the average dual fuel bill to around £1169. Falling wholesale gas and electricity prices have put pressure on the big six suppliers to pass on savings. By some measures, wholesale gas prices are at a five-year low, so is a 5% cut really enough? We want to be competitive and offer good value. We want to competitive and offer good value. We wa nt to retain want to retain the customers we have, that’s really important, but we also want to win new customers. Hundreds of thousands of new customers have joined Hundreds of thousands of new customers havejoined British Gas this year already. Wholesale electricity prices are on the floor and yet you are not moving prices at all? There is the wholesale cost but there is the transmission, the metering and the investment in renewables. Those three categories are where costs have been rising steadily. Margins have been rising too, some say that is why British Gas has announced this move before results due at the end of the month. Whatever the reason, consumer groups are calling for the other big six suppliers to cut prices too. The number of mental health patients who’ve had to travel away from their local area due to a lack of hospital beds has increased by almost a quarter over the past year. An investigation by the BBC has found that some patients have been sent hundreds of miles for treatment, in one case from Bristol to Scotland. NHS England says it is determined to improve mental health services. Our social affairs correspondent Michael Buchanan reports. For Daniel, Margate is home. Familiar, comforting. But his mental health problems have forced him to leave the Kent seaside. Two years ago, he was sent to Somerset because no hospital beds were available locally. When he fell ill again last month, he was sent to Manchester, nearly 300 miles away. I was a long way away from home because it took so long to get there. But I didn’t know where in the country I was. Was it scary going to Manchester? Not scary, just ridiculous. A rising number of very sick people are being ferried around the country in search of treatment and care. The number of mental health patient in England forced to travel to find a bed as increased from just over 3500 in 2014 tojust under 4500 increased from just over 3500 in 2014 to just under 4500 last year, a rise of 23%. A patient was sent from Bristol to Livingston, 370 miles. Another from Cumbria to London, a distance of 270 miles. This growing problem shames the NHS, sending six and lovable patients around the country looking for a hospital bed. -- probable. It can delay the recovery. More than 2000 psychiatric beds have been closed in England since 2000 psychiatric beds have been closed in England shutting wards is not the cause of the difficulties. Creating more beds will not necessarily solve the problem. What will is better access to housing, better alternatives to care, keeping people at home. Remember, people are really only admits it as a last resort. Daniel is now getting care in Margate, but the loneliness of being far from home still lingers. My wife telephoned me everyday. Much more comfort to be had from a real live human being than a telephone. NHS England say they have plans to ensure all psychiatric patients are treated locally. Britain’s Chris Froome has maintained his lead in the Tour de France after today’s eleventh stage. The 2013 champion finished ninth on the 117-mile route through the Pyrenees. Froome keeps his overall lead of two minutes and 52 seconds. Poland’s Rafal Majka won the stage. The race finishes in Paris a week on Sunday. England’s cricketers begin the second Test of the Ashes tomorrow morning with a 1-0 lead, though their captain insists Australia are still the favourites. England produced one of their best performances in recent years to win the first Test in Cardiff. But now there’s concern about how few people were actually watching. From Lord’s, joe Wilson reports. Two captains - one fuelled by victory, the other faced with uncertainty. After one match the Ashes perspectives have swapped for Clarke and Cook. Australia are at Lord’s, under pressure and unsure of their team, with a big defeat behind them. That is sport right there, the highs and lows. You have to be able to cop a few smacks in the mouth, get up and go again. In Cardiff, round one, we got beaten. We look forward to round two. Weather permitting the Lords Ashes Test is a great sporting occasion, and this ground will be full. But English cricket continues to wrestle with a difficult equation: The money they get from their subscription TV deal is crucial. joe Root’s heroics in Cardiff were watched, on average, by peak audience of 500,000, compared to the last home Ashes it’s declining viewing figures. Yes, they were disappointing, but at the end of the day it is the first Test, let’s see as we go along. We are doing a lot of work to try and reinvigorate that, from a viewing point of view. They said, ""What are you going to predict as a result of the Ashes?"". I said then, quite honestly, we would win the Ashes. I firmly believe that. And the captain’s view? Would you rather still be the underdog? Well, it is always nice being the underdog. Australia probably still are favourites, they only have to retain the Ashes, I suppose. But, as I said at the beginning of the series, it is not played on paper, not played on potential, it is what happens out there. While Cook has been keen to share a dressing room beer with the Australians, they say they will wait until the end of the fifth Test. England are 1-0 up, generally in the Ashes there is no such thing as peaking too soon. Time for the weather. Here’s Helen Willetts. At la st At last the sun came out, we have been stuck under a stubborn bank of cloud. It is still quite muggy. A fine evening and we keep the fine weather generally through tomorrow. Then it is all change. Overnight, quiet, mist and fog returns. It has been foggy all day in the Channel Islands. Quite chilly under the clearing skies. Behind me, trouble brewing. The low pressure will dominate the next 36 hours, and it is attached to a warm weather front. Temperatures up to 30 degrees, and it will bring that heat our way. Temperature is higher, although not a in Northern Ireland. Should be fine in northern Scotland and England. Temperatures higher than today. If the sun comes out, which it should, we are thinking possibly 29. Stilla it should, we are thinking possibly 29. Still a bit of mist and fog first thing. A slow start for some of us. So how is it looking at Lord’s? Fine, and pretty warm as well. It would be a more bright and dry day for the start of the Open golf. Not as warm. And then some rain to come on Friday. Some rain overnight on Thursday. Possibly thunderstorms across central Wales and southern England. Some downpours, combining with the weather front further north and unusually windy weather. We could have gales across parts of Northern Ireland and close to the central lowlands of Scotland on Thursday night into Friday. It will freshen UP night into Friday. It will freshen up the air. There is the risk of thunderstorms, and then we have rain and unseasonably windy weather spreading north. Tonight on BBC London: Last year, Boris johnson approved the purchase of three water cannon.

The Mayor of London could be on the lookout for a buyer who’ll take three water cannon off his hands.

Although the mayor has gone ahead and bought three water cannon, the Home Secretary ruled out their use in London and anywhere else. On the basis of the evidence provided by both the police and relevant independent bodies, I can inform the house that I have decided not to authorise the use of water cannon and the policing tactic for operational use in England and Wales.

The second-hand machines had more than 60 issues of faults which would have needed correcting and there were limitations to their use in response to disorder or other fast-moving situations. The mayor and Met police have cited the rioting of four years ago as a reason to have the Canon in future but the Home Secretary said it had the potential to be counter-productive, particularly in some communities.

Tim, thank you very much for that update. -- get things his own way. You’re watching BBC London news this Wednesday evening. Stay with us tonight as there’s lots more to come, including: A doctor meets the lifeguards who brought her back to life with a defibrillator. People living in west London who had hoped that part of the route for the new high speed rail link would be put into a tunnel have had their hopes dashed. MP’s have today turned down a request for a tunnel to be built beyond Ruislip, with a huge viaduct being built instead. Our reporter Tarah Welsh is in Harefield for us now. The high-speed rail line will literally run right through this activity centre behind those buildings and then across this leg. Everywhere you go in this area, there are signs saying stop HS2. But people had hoped for a compromise. He wanted the trains to run underground. That is not going to happen. The plan is for a tunnel which runs from all or common through to West Ruislip, which is not far from here. Trains will then travel and back into the time of further up the lane, on the way to Birmingham. Campaigners wanted it extended here, but today MPs rejected that proposal. They said a viaduct running right through this centre was a better option. They say it will be at least £200 million cheaper and that a tunnel would come with its own problems anyway. What difference will this all make to the people living there? Well, they say they will literally be living at the end of a tunnel and on a building site. There will be lots of traffic, noise. But the infrastructure just simply is not in place for it. For this activity centre, 20,000 children come here for outdoor activities every year. And the people that run it say that building HS2 means that it will simply have to close. The value being put on kids education versus business then getting to Birmingham ten minutes earlier, the balance is not there. Is this place goes, there is nowhere else for them to go. There are 20,000 kids a year come here. There justis 20,000 kids a year come here. There just is not the balance. The government says it recognises that this is an important facility and wants to another location but says that, you know, it is in favour of the committee’s decision. Campaigners and local people say that they are bitterly disappointed and are vowing to fight on. I am sure they are. Thank you very much. Every day, more than 25 Londoners are believed to die prematurely from air pollution. The figure released by City Hall and Transport for London is almost double the previous estimate and it’s led to calls for tough new action to deal with the problem. Our transport correspondent, Tom Edwards, is in Marylebone for more on this. We always knew that London had a serious pollution problem. Today, we have got a much clearer picture of the impact of this toxic error. Diesel cars produce the toxic gas nitrogen dioxide. It makes some of London’s most famous streets, like Oxford Street, the most polluted in the world. Today, for the first time, that pollutant was included in the new figures. It shows that the number of premature deaths in London caused by bad air is now 9400 people per year. Much higher than previously thought. Air quality is improving in our city. But I think everybody will agree that those figures are far too high. And it makes our case for going forward with the ultra low emissions zone and indeed forfighting off real challenges to air quality in London, such as a third runway at Heathrow Airport, ever more pressing. Nitrogen dioxide can cause heart and respiratory disease and lead to premature death. All of this will increase the pressure on drastically cutting the number of diesel engines in the capital. just yesterday, a report from the London Assembly said the mayor’s plan for an ultra low emission zone restricting diesel engines should be brought forward from 2020. The mayor has introduced more hybrid buses and an age limit on taxis but nitrogen dioxide levels have not come down much. Campaigners, however, have applauded the mayor for publishing these figures and say it is a wake-up call. I really do hope that this news today means the death of diesel, not the death of Londoners. These estimates from the mayor are going to send shock waves around the entire world. They are the first time these have been calculated and they are so much higher than we have ever understood before. And diesel is at the heart of this big increase on the numbers we are seeing today. I think the research was important and I think it shows that the mayor is serious about the scale of the problem. What he is not serious about is the solutions that are required. And I do not think he has been at all bold enough or treated the issue of air pollution with the seriousness and the urgency that it needs. Reducing the number of diesels will not be easy or cheap. But campaigners say this new evidence shows tough action is needed at all levels of government and in Europe. This comes at an absolutely crucial time in this debate. The Supreme Court is forcing the government to tackle pollution. These figures will certainly add to that pressure. A court’s heard how a former policeman pushed a black man twice and refused to allow him onto the Paris Metro as Chelsea fans chanted racist songs. Richard Barklie, from Northern Ireland, is one of four fans facing a football banning order over a racist confrontation ahead of Chelsea’s Champions League game in February. jon Brain is following the case at Thames Magistrates’ Court. jon? This incident would probably never have come to light if it had not been filmed by a member of the public on a mobile phone. The footage, which caused outrage on both sides of the channel, shows a black man trying to get into a tube train which is packed with Chelsea fans and been prevented. Metropolitan Police identified five men they claim were involved in that incident and they are trying to get them banning orders of between three and five years to stop and also make them surrender their passports for that time. One of the men has accepted the ban. The other four have been in court today to contest it. There are lawyers argue that they have been made scapegoats the stop the footage was shown of trouble in Paris that night and they were seen at various points in the group causing the trouble, but at no stage where they involved in the troubled themselves. There are lawyers say the police, after this incident, were desperate to show that Scotland Yard was doing something to crack on football hooliganism. The case will continue and a ruling is expected next week. Thank you. Dozens of lives have been saved in the past year thanks to a campaign led by the London Ambulance Service to get more defibrillators in public areas. The equipment sends strong electric pulses to someone’s heart when they’ve had a cardiac arrest, often making the difference between life and death. Karl Mercer has been to meet a Londoner saved by the relatively inexpensive device. Ido not really remember much from the day to be honest but I remember getting in the water and then Ijust remember waking up in hospital a few days later. Straight away I knew she was having a cardio crisis. She was not breathing and her colour started changing. Scary but it isjust one of those things. It happens for a minute and then you just go back to what you trained for and you start doing the CPR and what you were taught. Nearly three months ago, these three met in less happy circumstances. Natasha Price, 32, had just had a cardiac arrest at Finchley Lido. Chloe and Ozzie saved her life with CPR and the defibrillator. Any time it happens it is always a shock to yourself. But the adrenaline gets going and you just do what you were taught, really. We are CPR and defibrillator trained. We receive training two hours a month and we do scenarios exactly like what happened. So, yes, we knew exactly what to do. Natasha is one of 30 Londoners to have been saved in the last year following a London Ambulance campaign to get defibrillators into more workplaces. So far, 1000 extra have gone in. Yes, very lucky to have, you know, trained individuals who are very good at theirjob and can act in times of emergency. So that is what they did and they did it well, which is why I am standing here today. 'Stand clear. Press shock button.' This is what we are talking about, a machine that will help restart the heart and is designed to be simple to use. It will not deliver a shock unless the patient needs it. All of the defibs are fully automated so from the moment you open it up, you know where to place the pads, exactly how to switch it on etc. But for us, yes, fantastic she had immediate CPR, she had immediate recognition she was in arrest and she had a defib that was so close to start trying to get that rhythm changed in the heart. Natasha is now nearly back to full health and backing calls for more firms to use defibrillators. A hugely successful campaign. It is 6:lIlIpm. Still to come on the programme before 7pm: ~ I will have more on the warnings to stay away from giant hogweed. The comedian Michael McIntyre has found himself as the subject of a privacy row, after police tweeted a photograph of him in the street in central London. The picture, taken by a police helicopter, has now been taken down for being inappropriate. But it’s already caused quite a stir. Katharine Carpenter is here. So what happened? The police helicopter that operates around London has a very active Twitter account, with over 120,000 followers. As well as treating information about where it is flying and why, it has also got a reputation for its humorous tone, tweeting digital pictures of the London skyline. It seems in this case, the team of steps the mark. This is the image that is causing such controversy. It shows the comedian Michael McIntyre outside the radio studios in Leicester Square this morning. You cannot see his face but he was immediately identified on Twitter and there was a backlash straightaway, with people asking if this was an appropriate use of police surveillance powers. As members of the public, we have an understanding that there are so many ways that the police can put us under surveillance, whether CCTV cameras, body-worn cameras or even in the sky through helicopters. But we do that on the basis of trust, that they’re only going to look at us if we are subject to suspicion, if they think we are subject to criminal activity. And clearly this tweet shows that is not always the case. The National police air service, which oversees helicopter surveillance, has admitted that this was an inappropriate thing to publish in the public domain. But it says it does not think any laws have been broken. The surveillance camera Commissioner does not agree. He says that his Code of Conduct has been breached and that is potentially breaks data protection law. When I spoke to him earlier, he was very frustrated about all this. He said that public trust in surveillance was paramount and he said he would be having a very frank discussion with those in charge, both at the Met and the service, about how this was allowed to happen. He said it should not have been used for humour and fun. As for Michael McIntyre, his people have not commented so far but no doubt it might make some good material for him in future. I am sure it will. I know this is still being hotly debated on social media. Thank you very much. After nearly 100 years, a school which serves pupils with special needs is to close. The trust in charge of Penn School in High Wycombe says it’s ‘no longer viable’ to run, despite the school still helping young people with speech, hearing and behavioural problems. Yvonne Hall has been hearing from parents angry at the closure, and from the pupils themselves. Rebecca Clarke is 13 and has autism. Her mother says her confidence and behaviour have dramatically improved since she has been a pupil at Penn School. Penn School has been amazing for Rebecca. It is showing everyone Rebecca’s true potential. Instead of this vulnerable, quiet little girl, she is now opening up. Susan fears the closure of Penn School will badly affect her daughter’s behaviour and progress. I am worried that, you know, Rebecca is going to go back to her old ways, running off. Rebecca is going to revert back to not speaking to anyone. Outside the school, angry parents and staff campaign to keep it open. It has affected staff, students, parents. We have got children who have nowhere to go. The school closes next week, they have not got a school in sight. A couple of my children have been offered really inappropriate schools that will not meet their needs. The school has 55 pupils aged 11 to 19. Half of them live here. It offers them specialist help with speech, hearing and behavioural problems. Some of the people told us how they feel about the closure. Very upset. (Very upset.) I want this school to be safe. Because. .. So the children can go back in September. The school is run by a charitable trust with funding from education authorities. But since a poor Ofsted report two years ago, pupil numbers and funds have been falling here. Now, the trust says the school is no longer viable and must close next week. Protesters are accusing the trustees of incompetence. HORN TOOTS Nobody from the trust has been available for interview. Meanwhile, withjust a few days to go, campaigners are desperately trying to raise £1 million to keep the school open. The Rayners Special Educational Trust, which runs the school, denies the protestors’ accusations of ‘mismanagement and incompetence ', saying the claims are ‘totally unfounded’. If you’ve headed outside to enjoy a walk in the summer sun, you may well have come across this. It looks nice enough. But if you touch it, it can cause blisters, burns and even blindness. It’s called giant hogweed. And for more on this, let’s cross to Hanwell and hear from Alice Bha nd hu kravi. ~ Iamona I am on a public footpath, used by dog walkers and joggers. To my right, a field full of this stuff, giant hogweed. Most of it is brown because this deal has been treated. But you might see an example of fresh, green plant. It has been causing all sorts of problems recently to stop several people have been hospitalised in the last few days as a result of coming into contact with the giant hogweed. One lady, in Enfield, simply brushed past some with her leg and suffered severe burns. And two children, in Bolton, who were playing amongst the hogweed also suffered severe burns. Those cases have highlighted the risks. This is becoming such a huge problem. It was first reported 15 years ago and it is highlighted because of these poor children. ~ I know you’re being careful out there but how do we avoid being harmed by the plant? You have got to look out for it, for a start. Identified correctly to stop it looks a little bit like what people know as cow parsley. But it is different because it has got a reddish, purple stem. It has got fined spines on the stem and also has spotted leaf stalks. It can grow UP has spotted leaf stalks. It can grow up to five metres high, hence the name giant. It tends to grow along canals and river banks. It is the sad that causes the damage to stop it causes the skin to become hypersensitive to the sun and can cause severe burns. -- hypersensitive to the sun and can cause severe burns. -- the sap. Enfield Council has been working with environmental organisations to view the field and is working in the rest of the borough but it grows quite easily. It spreads very easily so the advice is, like as, keep a safe distance away from the giant hogweed. Very good and important advice. Thank you very much. What is art? This maybe? It may look as if art is about to be done but that is not the case. Or a bricklayerjust doing hisjob? Well, in London - which some now say is the ‘art capital of the world’- it seems the definition of art is as diverse as Londoners themselves. And that’s exactly what’s being celebrated at a gallery in east London which our arts correspondent, Brenda Emmanus, has visited. Brian Watts is a bricklayer from Newcross but his latest project is not a new build property but a work of art. Here in the Whitechapel Gallery, he has collaborated with his artist daughter, Demelza, to create a sculpture that forms her contribution to the venue’s latest exhibition, the London Open. I wanted to work with my father because he is an artist, in that he works in bricklaying. So we devised this piece together, I guess. Do you think we don’t appreciate the art of bricklaying? No, I don’t think you, really! It’s very time consuming. Following a record number of applicants, the London Open showcases a selection of works of artists living and working in the capital, reflecting the city’s diverse and vibrant artistic community. London really is the art capital of Europe and the world at the moment. London has put a lot of effort and hard work into supporting artists and supporting artist infrastructure and into supporting people who love art and are curious about finding out about art. That is what we love when we are doing the London Open, that we can talk to people, we can argue about art, and can laugh about art. We can talk about art and we can be enthusiastic about art. The Whitechapel Gallery held its first open submission in 1932. Called the East End Academy, it was for all artists living or working east of the famous Aldgate pump. Initially only open to East London artists, in 2012 the gallery extended its reach to artists all over London. CHORAL SINGING Performance art features strongly in this year’s offering. The launch was marked by a live choral performance conceived by artist and musician Sam Belafonte, featuring the musarc choir. London has become a crucible of culture and the broad range of work on show reflects how what is perceived as art has evolved, and why Londoners have a lot to say for themselves. Right, let’s get a check on the weather withjohn Hammond. A bit ofa A bit of a great start to the week but it was much better today. We got there in the end. It has been a grisly couple of days. It felt like November this morning. a grisly couple of days. It felt like Novemberthis morning. But things did brighten up the good news is, tomorrow is looking good. There will be some fun rain and it will pretty warm, I think, in the end of the afternoon. That is something to look forward to. We still have a fair bit of cloud across our patch but this thins and allows the sun breaks in the budget. Pleasant enough. Quite a muggy night to come, when that cloud drifts northwards. A bit of mist and drizzle over the hills but not too much of an issue. I’ve notjust as humid as last night. That is good news if you wanted to sleet! The lowest temptress to the north of London and in the countryside it could get a single figures. It might be a bit murky first then but I am pretty hopeful that it will brighten up nicely. The sun rises at 5:01am. By the time most of us are up, the sun will be getting to work on that cloud. It will come and go, the cloud. It will not be blues scares on the agenda all day long. If you’re going to the cricket, you wanted to know if it will stay dry. I think it will. In that sunshine it will begin to feel very warm indeed. 24 degrees, 25 degrees. I would not rule out 27, frankly. It will be one of those lovely, warm and at times sunny days. The priest will be freshening and we could see the odd thunderstorm later on tomorrow evening. Mostly to the west of London. Some thing to be aware of. Many of us will avoid these and stay fine. Most of the action will be further north across the UK. This area of low pressure brings heavy rain. That’ll sweep north eastwards. We are then into a run of fairly brisk westerly south-westerly winds. A different feel and Friday. It will feel fresher without the humility and some clouds starting across the sky to stop but the bottom line is, I think it will be drier up bright and breezy. What about the weekend? It is looking good. It will stay mostly find that sunshine. Notjust as good. It will stay mostly find that sunshine. Not just as warm but the winds will be dying down. All in all, not a bad weekend! Not bad at all. That’s it. join me again at ten tonight for our next news on BBC One. Until then, I hope you have a very good evening. Being a parent can be a real challenge. The risks are high. But the rewards are priceless. That is definitely my kind of theme tune that. Perfect for you. Love it. Welcome to The One Show with Alex jones And Matt Baker.

Oskar Groening had admitted moral guilt but said he did not facilitate the murder of hundreds of thousands ofjews. The man known as the ""Book- keeper of Auschwitz"" is jailed for four years but some former inmates say it’s time to forgive. If they want to use him as an example, fine.

The Home Secretary rules water cannon will not be used on the capital’s streets, leaving the mayor frustrated. And a question of privacy after a picture of Michael McIntyre is tweeted by a police helicopter team. Good evening. A court in Germany has convicted a 9lI-year-old man of being an accessory to the murder of at least 300,000 jews. Oskar Groening is expected to be one of the last Nazis to be tried for actions during the Second World War. He was an SS guard known as the ""Book- keeper of Auschwitz"" because he was responsible for counting the money confiscated from prisoners. He had admitted ""moral guilt"" but said he did not facilitate genocide, as our correspondent Caroline Wyatt reports. Guilty, the man known as the ""Book-keeper of Auschwitz"", now frail and in diminishing ""Book-keeper of Auschwitz"", now frailand in diminishing health. It’s taken over 70 years but at last, Oskar Groening will pay the price for his crimes. Most did not live for long once inside these gates. Over1 million people were killed at Auschwitz. Oskar Groening was tried for his part in the deaths of 300,000 jewish men, women and children. This was Oskar Groening a young, proud to wear his uniform. From 1942-4, he worked at Auschwitz, counting the money. Taken from the prisoners as they arrived. In1943, from the prisoners as they arrived. In 1943, Oskar Groening was 22-year-old Corporal... Unusually, 22-year-old Corporal. .. Unusually, he 22-year-old Corporal... Unusually, he spoke to the BBC ten years ago. To silence the holocaust deniers. He was asked if he was sorry that he had lived and prospered while millions died? TRANSLATION: Absolutely not. Everybody is looking out for themselves. So many people died in the war. Not onlyjews. So many things happened. Oskar Groening showed little emotion as he was sentenced to four years imprisonment as an accessory to the murder of 300,000 people. The verdict came so quickly thatjust one 300,000 people. The verdict came so quickly that just one survivor was here in court to witness it. But many others including those who gave evidence against Oskar Groening have welcomed the verdict and the fact thatjustice has finally welcomed the verdict and the fact that justice has finally caught up with one of the many thousands of SS men who worked to make Auschwitz possible. In those days, immigration was not... Susan wasjust 13 possible. In those days, immigration was not... Susan was just 13 when she arrived at the death camp from Hungary. Somehow she survived. Most of her family Hungary. Somehow she survived. Most of herfamily did of her family did not. Susan was one of many survivors who testified against Oskar Groening. He is a symbol, 94 years old, he’s notjust standing for himself, he is standing in for those many, many thousands of others who have escaped. Any trial. Any kind of sort of identification, what they were doing. Oskar Groening spent much of his life here in northern Germany. Even acting as a judge in industrial tribunal is. At the age of 94, Oskar Groening could be the last Nazi to face trial over his role in the Holocaust. The German Federal office for the prosecution of Nazi crimes has a number of other suspects under investigation. But they are all extremely elderly men. And, given how long this the preparations for a trial, how long all of that takes, I think it’s quite unlikely that any of these men, in their 90s, are actually going to appear in court. Oskar Groening never did say sorry. Even as he faced his victims in court. He was, his lawyers argued, a small cog in the bigger Nazi machine. Oskar Groening himself said only his God would forgive him. During the trial of Oskar Groening, one of the survivors of Auschwitz publicly forgave him. Eva Kor was one of those who suffered medical experiments at the Nazi death camp 70 years ago. In court she embraced the former SS guard and said she forgave him. She now lives in Indiana and our international correspondent Ian Pannell went to meet her. A warning that you may find some of the images in his report distressing. Eva Kor, witness to the darkest moment in history. A survivor of Auschwitz and the experiments. We came on track number one. The space between track number one and track number two is called the selection platform. She’s built a small museum in her adopted home platform. She’s built a small museum in heradopted home in in her adopted home in middle America. She gave evidence at Oskar Groening’s trial and today heard the news of his prison sentence. I am very disappointed. If they want to use him as an example, fine, I ask them to find him guilty, and to sentence him to community service. Which he could do, lecturing to young people who need to know about what happened, a former Nazi guard from Auschwitz could give them a lot of information that they would be impressed by it a lot more than by me, a survivor of Auschwitz. And thatis me, a survivor of Auschwitz. And that is exactly what she told Oskar Groening in this astonishing courtroom video. Despite so much pain, she decided to forgive those who would murdered her parents and so many others and tortured her and her sister to the point of death. I no longer carry any anger or hatred towards anybody and that is not because they deserve it, but I deserve it. But once I don’t have animosity and anger towards them, your opening yourself up to a lot of other human emotions. And I know that people are very quick to anger. For the life of me, Ido not understand why nobody cares to endorse my gesture of kindness towards an old man or his gesture of loving towards me, why is that such a big crime? Why are we so willing to accept animosity and revenge, and not goodwill? These are the laboratories. We never used them, six days a week, three days observation sitting naked. There are few left to tell the stories now and Eva Kor worries mankind has been too ready to forget its solemn vow of what she and her sister and millions more suffered should never happen again. In Athens, riot police have used tear gas against protestors outside the Greek parliament ahead of a vote by MPs on the reforms demanded by the Eurozone. The prime minister Alexis Tsipras says he doesn’t agree with the reforms but says they are the price that has to be paid for a new bailout. Many from his own party are expected to vote against. Our Europe editor Katya Adler is in Athens tonight. And Katya is in Athens for us tonight. The violence here began pretty much at the same time as the debate inside Parliament started on the new bailout deal. People that we met running away from the squares that this is another must sign of what yet could come to Greece -- ominous sign. A new bailout deal can only bring harsher conditions. This had been billed asjudgment Day for Greece. The day the Prime Minister tried to squeeze tough reforms through Parliament to prove to miss trustful creditors abroad that he was in control of the situation at home. But that is not quite as it turned out. The riots are getting increasingly violent. There firebombs at the police demonstrators. The peaceful protesters have disappeared from this street. They wanted a better future for their country. This is definitely not what they had in mind. The violence began with small groups of masked troublemakers. Until then, the thousands of protesters here had been peaceful if angry. It’s a prison for people. It is a present for all. No education, no health, no anything. We don’t want Europe. We don’t want to be in this prison. The Eurozone. It’s not just the euro. Certain countries have been singled out for the harshest punishment. We don’t want it to go on like this. I’m 25 years old. The atmosphere inside Parliament was stormy, too. Many MPs are furious with the Greek by Minister for agreeing to a bailout deal which, Minister for agreeing to a bailout dealwhich, in their opinion, humiliate their country. The parliament is voting on a package of tax increases, pension reforms and a commitment to liberalise the labour market. Once this has been agreed, Greece is hoping for a short-term crass injection by Monday to avoid bankruptcy. -- cash injection. Finally, the Eurozone. The process of agreeing a possible 86 billion new row bailout deal which could take at least one month. The deputy finance minister has resigned in disgust. Why did you stand down? Both Greece and Europe, it shows not only is but Europe is facing trouble. Denied Europe will watch horrified at scenes of rage and distress in Greece. Four years, people here have warned that, under the weight of suffocating debt and spreading poverty, their society is stumbling and falling apart. Will their partners in Europe listen now? What are the prospects do you think for the Parliamentary vote and what other prospects for the days to in Greece? The bill is likely to pass because large chunks of the opposition say they will support the Prime Minister but his position will be severely weakened if, as expected, quite a number of his MPs vote against him. And all of this is in a fight over a bailout which may yet never take off from the ground because a number of other Eurozone Parliament need to approve at first including in hardline Germany where Angela Merkel faces a potential rebellion from inside her own party and the detail of this new rescue package also needs still to be worked out, potentially deepening already existing rifts between key European superpowers like Germany, France and Italy and their co-creditor, the IMF, over how hard line to be with Greece and over whether and how to reduce its crippling debt. Thanks very much indeed. Lawful strike action would become almost impossible under plans being put forward by ministers, according to the trades unions. The Government’s Trade Union Bill would impose a minimum 50% turnout and public sector strikes would need the backing of at least 40% of those eligible to vote. Ministers say the Bill will ensure a balance between the interests of the unions and the rest of the public. But the unions say it’s a fundamental attack on workers’ rights, as Vicki Young reports. The Government wants to see less of this kind of disruption to public services. Last year, strike action by hundreds of thousands of workers, including teachers, wouldn’t have been legal under new rules unveiled today. Unions say workers won’t be able to fight for their rights, but those who’ve had to deal with the fallout from strike action say it’s time to get tough. They say it will stop people withdrawing their labour, a fundamental right, they day? I don’t think it will do that at all. People will always have the right to strike and withdraw their labour. All we want to do is stop coercion by union leaderships into getting people who don’t want to strike, who are very often the majority, forced out onto the streets not able to earn for that day and to cause a lot of disruption to everybody else. The new strike law would require a minimum 50% turnout in any ballot. In essential public services like transport and health, at least 40% of eligible voters would have to support industrial action. So what’s the impact of strikes in Britain? In the ‘70s and ‘80s, close to 30 million working days were lost in some years. Now walkouts are much rarer although there was a slight increase in 2011 with protests over public sector pensions. The new strike rules include plans to allow agency staff to be brought in to cover for those on the picket line. Union leaders say it’s an attack on workers. Much of this is counter-productive and will impact on industrial relations in such a negative way that we will spend more time talking about the legislation, how to get round it, how it’s unfair, than actually dealing with the issues that are out there. And there’s a sting in the tail for the Labour Party too. Union members will have to actively opt-in for their membership fee to be paid into Labour coffers. It’s not acceptable for him to be curbing funds from hard-working people to the Labour Party while turning a blind eye to donations from hedge funds to the Tories. Why is ther such a blind spot, even with the Honourable Lady, when it comes to the trade union paymasters? Soon Labour will have a new leader. All of the candidates in that race oppose the changes to strike rules and odds have been slashed on the left-winger and union favourite, jeremy Corbyn. Ministers want to limit the kind of disruption that was seen across stations like this last week, and they firmly believe that the public is on their side in this battle. But there’s politics in this too. Conservatives want to make it awkward for Labour, not just over their union funding, but forcing them to speak out in favour of strike action. Vicky, Young, BBC News, Central London. Scientists have been celebrating the arrival of detailed images of Pluto sent back by the New Horizons spacecraft. The probe sped past Pluto yesterday capturing an immense volume of data. Significantly, all the images are at a much higher resolution than anything seen so far. From Mission Control in Maryland our science editor, David Shukman, reports. On the edge of the solar system a mesmerising view of Pluto, revealing in close-up extraordinary details of mountains made of ice. The image only reached Earth this morning and no-one can yet explain it. And a new view of Pluto’s largest moon, Charon, an unprecedented sight of an alien world with dramatic scenery, including an unexpected and vast C8I’IyoI’I. It’s about four to six miles deep. I find that fascinating. So it’s a small world with deep canyons, troughs, cliffs, dark regions that are still slightly mysterious to us. All this began back injanuary 2006 with the fastest ever launch. The New Horizons spacecraft sent hurtling towards Pluto. The journey involved a very precise schedule for the fly-past, to happen at a particular time, and flying for nine-and-a-half years, it arrived 72 seconds early. Even the approach transformed our view of Pluto. The images becoming clearer, reaching a peak, 24-hours ago, with the closest encounter. This is a model of the spacecraft on the mission to Pluto. It’s packed with instruments to measure everything from Pluto’s atmosphere, to its structure, to its surface. Here are the cameras, infra-red and round this side, high resolution for the close-up. The antenna beams everything back here. Because the spacecraft is now so for away that way that job will take 16 months in all, today is just the start. We have a healthy spacecraft. A key step came when Mission Control confirmed the spacecraft had survived the fly- past. APPLAUSE. The scientist leading the mission was overjoyed. For years he’s planned to explore Pluto, now it’s happening. APPLAUSE. It’s totally exciting. When we started off looking and saying we’re going to go and go to Pluto, it was a tiny little dot, and now it’s a real world. A real world with geology and so on and five moons that are their own worlds too. And because Pluto is not alone, but is one part of a huge outer zone of the solar system, called the kuiper belt, this mission becomes the first to a totally unexplored realm of space. So tonight is about worlds that were hidden until now. The vast canyon on the moon Charon, and those ice mountains on the surface of Pluto. This isjust the beginning of our exploration to the farthest reaches of our solar system. What amazed the scientists here is that these distant worlds are not dull lumps of rock of ice they are more active than anyone could possibly have expected. There are processes changing their surface that can’t be explained at the moment. When you thought they might have got a handle on the workings of our solar system, which is our neighbourhood in space, afterall, they have a lot of new thinking to do. All because of the discoveries of a tiny spacecraft that’s three billion miles away. David many thanks. David Shukman there, our science editor at Mission Control in Maryland. Unemployment has risen for the first time in more than two years. New figures show a rise of 15,000 across the UK between March and May bringing the jobless total to 1.85 million. But at the same time, average weekly pay rose at the fastest rate in more than seven years. Our economics editor, Robert Peston, considers the impact of the latest economic picture, including the effect on interest rates. The sparks and thuds of wealth creation. Metal working in Shrewsbury. A company, Salop Design & Engineering, which can’t get enough skilled operatives to meet demand and doesn’t really understand today’s first national rise in unemployment for more than two years. I think it must a short-term blip. I think manufacturing is very strong in the UK and I think it will continue to strengthen. We fell a long way back in the recession, and so there is a lot of climbing to do. We’re back to almost, almost where we were, but there’s still room to grow. I think there’s a lot of other manufacturers that are continuing to grow as well. After the great crash of 2008, unemployment reached a peak - greater than 8% of the available workforce - just under four years ago and has been falling and falling since then. But this year the rate ofjob creation has slowed considerably and has now gone into reverse - a bit. I think we’ve seen a combination of a short-term blip, but also the end of a long-term expansion in the labour market. So, looking forward, we’re going to see jobs coming back, but nowhere near as strong as in the past. Now the striking trends are rising unemployment among women and a fall in the number of self-employed. As it happens in Scotland, unemployment actually fell a bit to below the UK average. In most of the British economy however employers complain, theyjust can’t get the people. We see that there is a shortage in every single sector and every region of the UK in the jobs market. So trying to find people in skilled roles, whether it’s construction, engineering, IT is difficult, but equally we’re finding it difficult to find people as general labourers, office professionals, nurses. That’s an explanation for why pay is rising faster, after adjusting for inflation, than at any time since 2007. So here, at the Bank of England, they face something of a dilemma. Does the fastest rise in wages since before Northern Rock went down pose a threat that inflation will take off and therefore interest rates have to rise to ward that risk off? Or, does the first rise in unemployment for more than two years show that the economy is slowing down and that therefore there’s no inflationary risk? This simultaneously hot and cold jobs market is something of a puzzle. Busy, busy worker bee, lovely weather for making honey and money, but for how much longer may depend on how and when the Bank of England puts up interest rates. Robert Peston, BBC News. A brief look at some of the day’s other other news stories. British Gas is cutting household gas prices by 5% from the end of August. It will mean an average saving of £35 on annual energy bills. It’s the company’s second reduction this year, but critics have said the cut is too small. The Home Secretary, Theresa May, has refused to authorise the use of water cannon, which are used in Northern Ireland, by police in England and Wales. Last year, London’s Mayor, Boris johnson, agreed to buy three water cannon for the Metropolitan Police. But Mrs May said she wouldn’t allow the equipment to be deployed after assessing medical and scientific evidence. CCTV images have been released showing the moment the head of one of Mexico’s most notorious drugs cartels escaped from prison. joaquim Guzman can be seen pacing his cell on Saturday before escaping through a tunnel in the shower. Authorities say they will pay a substantial reward for information leading to his recapture. It’s the second day of a UN summit in Ethiopia aiming to set new development goals for the international community. But no agreement on sustainable development will be credible without China’s backing. After three decades of growth, the world’s biggest country has a major challenge to deal with environmental damage. It’s estimated 20% of China’s arable land is polluted with heavy metals. 90% of ground water is said to be contaminated. More people are now at risk of being killed by air pollution than by smoking. Our China editor, Carrie Gracie, reports from Hunan Province in Central China on the country’s search for sustainability. Water, the life giver, but here it’s a silent killer. Yang ju-Chin’s water is polluted with industrial waste. This land was once known as China’s basket of rice and fish, but it’s also rich in minerals. So as China became the factory to the world, chemical and metal industries moved in here. Untreated effluent in the water. Heavy metal is in the soil. Sulphur dioxide in the air. A fifth of China’s farmland is contaminated, and Yang ju-Chin complains her crops are all bad. TRANSLATION: Here, in this village, many people have cancer. Three people died in three months. They were all so young. It’s so toxic here. China’s often congratulated for pulling hundreds of millions from poverty, but wealth has come at a heavy price. Unregulated, smoke-stacked industries have ravished the environment and damaged the health of generations. But now polluting factories are being demolished. China has said creating jobs and turning a profit can no longer come at the expense of public health. TRANSLATION: No more economic growth sustained by blood. Under the new environment law, every factory has to be approved before it is built. No more unregulated chaos. just one of the factories forced to move away from the fields into a new industrial zone. In the old days, minerals for enamel paints were mixed by hand and no-one wore a mask. But the consequences of China’s Industrial Revolution are harder to overcome. At only three years old, this boy has three times the safe level of lead in his blood. No sign of the factory next door moving. His health endangered by the air, food and water that should nourish him. China has a long way to go to make good on its promise to children like this. Sustainable development in which every life counts. Carrie Gracie, BBC News, Hunan Province. Britain’s Chris Froome has maintained his lead in the Tour de France after today’s eleventh stage. The 2013 Champion finished ninth on the 117-mile route through the Pyrenees. Froome keeps his overall lead of two minutes and 52 seconds. The race finishes in Paris a week on Sunday. Cricket. England captain, Alistair Cook, says Australia ""are still probably favourites"" to claim the Ashes despite his side’s First Test victory in Cardiff. The Second Test gets under way at Lord’s tomorrow and Australia are struggling with injuries as our sports correspondent, joe Wilson, reports. Two captains, one fuelled by victory, the other faced with uncertainty. After one match, the Ashes perspectives have swapped for Clarke and Cook. Australia are at Lord’s under pressure, unsure of their team, and with a big defeat behind them. That’s sport right there, the highs and lows. You have to be able to cop a few smacks in the mouth, get up and go again and in Cardiff, in round one, we got beaten. We look forward to round two. It’s a bit like watching Australia from behind the sight scene as players fade from view. First, fast bowler Ryan Harris retired. Wicketkeeper Brad Haddin has family concerns, keeping him out of this match. All wish him well. But elsewhere, who’s doing the confusing? Over night, the Australian media reported with absolute confidence that a key man, Shane Watson, had been dropped from the team. Lunchtime today, here at Lord’s, Michael Clarke, the captain, told us he hadn’t been told what the team was going to be. Um, in comparison, England’s thinking would seem clear. They said, what are you going to predict as the result of the Ashes? I said then, quite honestly, you know, we would win the Ashes. I firmly believe that. And, the captain’s view? Would you rather still be an underdog? It’s always nice being the underdog, isn’t it? No, Australia probably still are favourites. Australia want to wait until the end of the fifth Test before the two teams share dressing room beers. Now generally, in the Ashes, there’s no such thing as peaking too soon. joe Wilson, BBC News at Lord’s. On BBC Two, Newsnight has the tale of the spy who spent 18 years with Now, on BBC One, it’s time for the news where you are. Have a very good night. Good evening. I’m Asad Ahmad. The Home Secretary has refused to allow the use of water cannon a year after the Mayor of London bought three of them for the Metropolitan Police. But now, as he knows, they’ll never be used, Boris johnson could well tonight be looking for a buyer to get back as much of the £330,000 he spent. Critics are calling it a complete waste of tax-payers’ money. Here’s Tim Donovan. In Northern Ireland they’ve been used just recently but although the Mayor has gone ahead and bought three water cannon, the Home Secretary today ruled out their use in London and anywhere else. On the basis of the evidence provided by both the police and the relevant independent bodies, I can inform the House that I have decided not to authorise water cannon as a policing tactic for operational use in England and Wales. And there was no shortage of reasons. She was not convinced that water cannon were safe. There had been injuries abroad. The second-hand machines bought by the Mayor had more than 60 issues or faults which would have needed correcting. And there were limitations to their use in response to disorder or other fast moving situations. The Mayor and the Met had cited the rioting of four years ago as a reason to have the cannon in future, but the Home Secretary said it had the potential to be counter-productive particularly in some communities. I do not believe and thinking Londoners do not believe that undermining a centuries-old tradition of policing by consent is the way to go on these very serious matters. A special cut-price deal the Mayor called it. New, the cannon would have cost more than £2 million but his deal is more expensive than first thought. A Freedom of Information request by the BBC reveals the cost of the three second-hand machines. Once you factor in transportation, refits, maintenance and office training, it reached nearly £329,000. Today the Mayor try to salvage what he could. Can I remind her that the decision to buy the canons was taken in light of the strong support of the Metropolis, for this operational tool, the crowd control, of the strong support of the Prime Minister and indeed of the strong support of the people of London. The Met police said they were disappointed but officers had been getting valuable training and would be ready if extreme disorder prompted a rethink in future. He went ahead with the purchase without her say-so. Today’s decision he clearly didn’t expect. More than 25 Londoners are believed to die prematurely from air pollution every day. The figure released by City Hall and Transport for London is almost double the previous estimate. Reason for the high death rate include the use of diesel vehicles, which are blamed for the rise in nitrogen dioxide. A court has heard how a former policeman pushed a black man twice and refused to allow him onto the Paris Metro as Chelsea fans chanted racist songs. Richard Barklie, from Northern Ireland, is one of four fans facing a football banning order over a racist confrontation ahead of Chelsea’s Champions League game in February. Mr Barklie denies he’s racist. Comedian Michael McIntyre has found himself at the centre of row over privacy after a police helicopter tweeted a photograph of him in central London. It caused anger on social media by those who believed police surveillance cameras had been misused, while Tarah Welsh has more on this. This is causing quite a stir. The police helicopter in London has a very popular Twitter account, more than 120,000 followers and it often shows pictures of the London skyline and has a humorous tone to it. Today people have said it may have overstepped the mark. This is the image which has caused all the frenzy on twitter. It said, in central London this morning, we spotted a certain energetic funnyman. Can you guess who? It shows the comedian Michael Mclntyre in Leicester Square. You can’t see his face. He was quickly identified. Immediately, there was a backlash of people saying is this appropriate use of the surveillance? We have an understanding with so many ways the police put under surveillance, CCTV cameras, even by helicopters, but we do that on the basis of trust that they will only look at us if we are subject to suspicion and they think we are under criminal activity and this is not the case. What are the National Police Air Service saying? National Police Air Service said it does not believe any laws have been broken. The surveillance regulated disagrees. The man who oversees theirs says the incident breaches his code of conduct and potentially breaks data protection laws. He will have a full and frank discussion with those in charge at the air service about releasing this image to the public. As far as Michael Mclntyre goes, he is yet to comment. Thank you very much. Campaigners in North West London say they are bitterly disappointed after MPs rejected plans for a new tunnel to take High Speed Rail trains through their area. Hillingdon Council said the Rail Link should run through a tunnel to reduce disruption. But the argument has been rejected as a viaduct over Ickenham was said to be cheaper and more feasible. Finally, a warning to avoid a plant which looks harmless enough but if you touch it, it can cause blisters, burns and even blindness.

Four people are thought to be trapped after an explosion at a wood treatment works in Cheshire. The blast at Wood Flour Mills in Bosley happened just after nine o’clock this morning. Cheshire Police say it is a ""major incident"". Our correspondent Lisa Hampele reports. people living nearby have been told to stay indoors. It felt like an earthquake, say people living near close by. Plumes of smoke could be seen for miles. There were two explosions around 9am this morning and the four storey flour mill collapsed. The impact was enormous. I saw this big black smoke, like a fireball coming off it. The fireball seemed to disappear very quick, but as it seemed to go off the floor and the walls were shaking and as I turned back round it was like another explosion which had gone off. It was pretty scary, very loud. It’s not clear how many people are trapped. A major incident has been declared and large numbers of police, fire crews, ambulances and doctors are at the scene. Police say there have now been two more explosions and fire fighters are facing a dangerousjob as they search for the missing. So far, two people have been taken to hospital suffering from burns. People living nearby are being advised to keep their windows and doors closed because of the smoke. Our correspondent Dave Guest is near the scene. Bring us up to date. What more can you tell us? You can probably see the smoke still rising across the fields, although the fire service tell us they are in the damping down stage of this operation. Four people remain unaccounted for. Whether they are in the building or not is unclear. Two people were taken to hospital with burns. One, a man, has been detained in hospital and is undergoing treatment. This has been treated as a major incident by the emergency services. There have been ambling screws on the north-west and Midlands here, I5 fire appliances on site, at one point the four storey Elding collapsed. It has been a complicated place to get control of. The children in the nearby school have been told to stay indoors. 165 houses have had their power cut off as a safety precaution to enable firefighters to tackle the blaze more safely. Still quite a confused picture and ongoing situation. It’s emerged that a small number of British military pilots have been carrying out air-strikes in Syria, while working for allies in the US-led coalition. The Commons voted nearly two years ago against British military action there. Responding to a Freedom of Information request, the government confirmed that some UK personnel- embedded with the forces of the USA and Canada - have been authorised to take part in operations against the Islamic State group in Syria. It’s thought about 20 personnel, including three pilots, are involved. Our Security Correspondent Frank Gardner reports. Air strikes on Isis. Only US and Canadian warplanes, not the RAF, target their forces in Syria. Today, it has emerged that three British pilots, flying in US planes, have also been taking part in air strikes over Syria. Parliament only authorised air strikes in Iraq. They have been flying in these aircraft, FA 18s from a US Navy aircraft carrier in the Gulf, supported by 17 more British personnel. Militarily the geography makes little difference. The coalition is attacking Isis across both Syria and Iraq. Politically, it does matter. Two years ago parliament voted overwhelmingly against Britain getting involved in Syria’s civil war. It’s clear to me that the British Parliament, reflecting the views of the British people, does not want to see British military action. I get that and the government will act accordingly. The whole question of air strikes over Syria risks becoming an issue of blurred lines, because British warplanes already fly surveillance and refuelling missions over Syria. They also conduct air strikes over Iraq. The coalition warplanes conduct air strikes over both countries. So the question is, should Parliament have been consulted before British pilots embedded with those of air forces flu air strikes over Syria? We were told that the bittern had got the message and that any future intervention would be subject to a vote. Here we are learning we have British military personnel engaged in airstrikes. British military personnel engaged in air strikes. But that, says a former RAF commander, is permissible. Operating in Syria is a perfectly normal, once you are invited in those squadrons, it is vital they are able to do that. On the ground, in Syria and Iraq, the jihadists of Isis remain in control of large swathes of territory, imposing a brutal rule and pushing to expand. Coalition air strikes have been crucial in stopping them taking more ground. So Britain’s exact role in this campaign needs to be clarified now. If the government gets its way, RAF tornadoes based in Cyprus will soon be joining US planes and air strikes -- Cyprus will soon be joining US planes and air strikes -- in air strikes over Syria, but Parliament will need to be consulted first. Let’s speak to our political correspondent Ross Hawkins. Downing Street says the Prime Minister knew UK personnel were involved in US operations. Did he know they were fighting in Syria? He did. The Prime Minister knew about the air strikes. The government is saying these embedded operations have gone on for some 50 years, people have known that they exist and none of those pilots are flying missions at the moment, but, and it is a huge but, the is simply why weren’t MPs informed, having just two years ago voted against military action in Syria. There is trouble coming on this. Labour, on Monday, will demand that ministers come to the House of Commons and explain the situation. Some senior, influential Conservative backbenchers are concerned. One said the executive, the government, was pushing its look. I think you’ll see a debate not necessarily about the wisdom of the bombing, it may be that comes anyway, it may be that the government and the opposition could agree to authorised those strikes at some point in the future. The issue will be that Parliament wasn’t told on a deployment this controversial and sensitive and members of parliament had to find out through a Freedom of information request instead. A manhunt is under way for a driver who stabbed another motorist to death after a collision between their two vehicles. The accident happened last night near Findon in West Sussex. The 79-year-old victim died at the scene. A murder investigation is under way. Duncan Kennedy is therefore is now. Ewan-macro there is a huge police operation going on at the scene, not only looking for clues as to what has happened but also for that man in his 30s, responsible for killing that 79-year-old man, who has been named locally as Don Lock. The police are not officially describing this as a road rage incident but thatis this as a road rage incident but that is certainly how local people are calling it. They tell us they are utterly shocked by what has happened. This was the scene of the attack moments after it happened. Paramedics are trying to revive the 79-year-old man, but police say he was pronounced dead by the roadside. He had been stabbed several times. Detectives say it happened after the Oldham and pulse back car hit another car last night, in what they call a minor rear another car last night, in what they calla minor rear end another car last night, in what they call a minor rear end shunt -- the elderly man’s car hit another car. The man went up to the 79-year-old man and stabbed him. The younger man then drove off. This woman came across the scene a few seconds later. I asked the gentleman on my right what had happened, had there been an accident, and he said no, an altercation. I said, been an accident, and he said no, an altercation. Isaid, an accident? He said no, road rage. Can you believe it? Not really, it’s been shocking, quite sad. Sad for the family as well. The man who died has been named by his friends as Don Lock. This morning, they brought flowers to the scene. He would do anything for anyone. You could not wish for a better guy. Unbelievable. The murder happened in the heart of the South Down National Park, one of the most beautiful places in southern England. No one here can understand how an elderly man could be killed by another driver, who was not only carrying a knife but was prepared to use it. There will be a police press conference in about 20 minutes and we will get more details as to what happened. Police say the man they are looking for is six feet tall, in his 30s, with shoulder-length, wavy brown hair. His vehicle is pale in colour. They are asking the public to help look for the car and also the man as well. The funerals of eight of the British tourists who died in the beach attack in Tunisia are taking place today. They include three generations of the same family. Their funerals are taking place in Wednesbury in the West Midlands - and our correspondent, Andrew Plant, is there. Three cars in the funeral procession carrying three generations of one family, killed in Tunisia. Adrian Evans works for a local council, the calendar showing his holiday plans. All three were killed on their first day abroad. His 78-year-old father, Charles Evans, known as Pat, died beside him. He leaves his wife, Maureen, behind. 19-year-old grandsonjoel Richards Maureen, behind. 19-year-old grandson joel Richards was also killed. His 16-year-old brother revived the attack. I still haven’t really absorbed the full horror of what happened. Three members of the same family killed suddenly, for no good reason. 38 people died in the attack on a beach and hotel near Sousse, in Tunisia. 30 were from the UK and today, exactly three weeks on, eight are being laid to rest. 2lI-year-old Carly Lovett’s funeral has been held in Gainsborough. She was recently engaged. Bruce Williamson’s family had a private service in his hometown of school this morning. A service of thanksgiving was held for Sue Davie in Tamworth in Staffordshire. And john and janet Stocker’s funeral is being held in south-west London. They leave behind five children and ten grandchildren. The three men being remembered here today, grandfather, son and grandson, all supported Walsall FC. Where fans showed their grief and their support in the days after they died. The stadium will hold a private service this afternoon. Here, several hundred people have filled the areas both inside and outside the church. To come and pay their respects. It is one of five funerals taking place across the UK today. In memory of those killed in Tunisia. A chance for people here to come and say their goodbyes. Four US Marines have been shot dead during an attack on a military recruitment office and a Naval reserve centre in the city of Chattanooga in Tennessee. The gunman - who has been named as 2lI-year-old Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez - was killed by police. Officials have said there is no evidence to suggest that Abdulazeez was linked to any terrorist organisation. President Obama called the shooting ""heartbreaking"". The Department of Health has said a limit on care costs - which was due to come into effect in England next April- will be delayed until 2020. The cap would have restricted the amount a person pays on social care to £72,000. Our Social Affairs correspondent, Alison Holt, is with me. Bringing the cap in was a manifesto commitment for the Tories. What’s happened? It was a manifesto commitment, to introduce the care capped by April 2016. Social care funding, many people will say, is in crisis. We have an ageing population and there are the financial pressures on council budgets. The Local Government Association had asked for consideration of whether this should be paused. The government has come back and has suggested, and has said indeed, that it is going to delay things. What will surprise many people as the length of delay. It’s not by a year, but four years. We have some of the thinking in a written ministerial statement issued 30 minutes ago. At a time of consolidation, it’s not the right moment to be in lamenting expensive new commitments such as this. They maintain they are committed to this. It will happen, but not until 2020. That leaves one big question. Funding it is at the heart of this. The councils are hoping they will still get the money earmarked for the implementation of the cap, to stabilise the existing system. We are told no decision about funding will be announced until the competence of spending review. There will be a lot of people worried that the necessary money, the question is, will it be there.

And how an Essex company made the recent images of Pluto possible. Memorial services are taking place around the world to mark the anniversary of the MH17 air disaster over Ukraine. All 298 people on board were killed, including ten British citizens. Commemorations are being held in Malaysia, Australia, the Netherlands and eastern Ukraine. Russian-backed rebels have been widely accused of firing the missile that brought the plane down, but Moscow denies this. Anna Holligan sent this report. These are the unforgettable images of Flight MH17. The linings of the passengers scattered in fields of sunflowers. 298 people lost their lives, including 80 children. They had said off from Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport, had said off from Amsterdam’s Schipholairport, now Schiphol airport, now synonymous with the disaster.

Adults and children should halve the amount of added sugar they eat and drink, according to experts. The Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition says only five percent of daily calories should come from what are known as ""free sugars"", which include those found naturally in honey and fruit juice. For adults, that’s the equivalent of seven teaspoons a day. Here’s our Health Correspondent Adam Brimelow. It is one thing setting out what people should aspire to eat and drink, quite another making it happen. Lowering the recommended limit for added sugars will be the challenge for government, the industry and the public. The new advice proposes a limit of 5% of total calories from added sugar. For people over 11 that is equivalent to 30 grams or seven sugar cubes a day. For seven to ten-year-olds it accounts for no more than than 24 grams or six sugar cubes. And for four to six-year-olds it isjust 19 grams or five cubes. At the moment the average intake in all groups is at least twice this limit. What kind of things would we be eating? For breakfast there might be a couple of wheat biscuits with a chopped banana. For lunch, cheese and chutney on a roll with salad and fruit. For dinner, a veggie bean chilli and a treat, a small chocolate mousse. There is a snack thrown in along the way. All of this contains just over half the added sugar you might encounter in one can of regular cola. A switch to this type of diet would help tackle obesity and type two diabetes. But is it realistic? It will require a big cultural change in how we eat. These meals are doable but they need planning. They need people to shop, to prepare, to cook the meals, to prepare foods to take with them when they go to work or school. So it is different to what we’re doing at the moment. And that is before you factor in the extra cost. The government has rejected taxing sugar to help change people’s choices. But the head of the NHS in England says retailers could decide for themselves to increase the cost of sugary goods. This is an option for retailers as they think about how to fund the national living wage. If they reflect the costs of that in the prices they choose to charge for sugary drinks and junk food for kids, then this could be a win, win. It will take the pounds of the waistlines of our children and put pounds in the pockets of employees. The food industry says it is already working to cut added sugars, but it is under pressure to do much more. The German parliament hasjust opened in favour of opening detailed talks on the proposed bailout for Greece. During an often angry debate, Chancellor Angela Merkel told the Bundestag it had been hard for everybody but that it was needed to avoid chaos. Let’s speak to jenny Hill in Berlin. Tensions laid bare? Absolutely. Angela Merkel has effectively got her way. She can begin negotiations over a third bailout deal for Greece. It is begin negotiations over a third bailout dealfor Greece. It is her 61st birthday today but I doubt she is in celebratory mood. That is because this boat has exposed political turmoil here in Berlin. She has had to deal with open rebellion from her own party. We do not yet know the political colours of the people who voted against the proposals. For many of them it is simply getting harder to sell the idea of a bailout for Greece to taxpayers back in their constituencies. I think there is huge public support in Germany for the plight of the Greek people but there is also huge mistrust in the Greek government and its promise to implement all of these reforms. In fact, this morning a poll revealed that 1+9% of all Germans think it is a mistake to begin negotiations over a new bailout package. Nevertheless, the vote has gone through. There will be another vote at a later date on the actual bailout deal, when and if a deal is put together. The Bundestag is one of a number of European Parliament stuff will have to approve it before it is put into practice. Before the MPs voted this lunchtime, Angela Merkel said to them that the prose of the bail out outweigh the cons. She described the situation in Greece as a shambles but went on to say that Europe needed compromise in the same way that man needed air to breathe. jenny Hill. Play finally got underway at the Open at St Andrews this morning, after a three hour delay due to heavy rain. Greens, fairways and bunkers were flooded and an army of greenkeepers were deployed to clear the standing water. Let’s get the latest from our correspondent Andy Swiss. Welcome to St Andrews where it is cool and blustery but a lot better thanit cool and blustery but a lot better than it was first thing this morning when the course was essentially underwater. Thanks to an amazing effort from the staff here, play is finally underway. Nice weather for docs but not for birdies. St Andrews I walk to an early morning deluge. Fairways were transformed into paddling pools. A 3 one half hour delay and a huge mop UP one half hour delay and a huge mop up operation. The water hazards getting a refill. The hardy few who braved it out were soon rewarded, astonishingly by 10am there were playing. With most of the big-name snap out until the afternoon, it was a chance for others to a move. Scotland’s Richie Ramsay gave the home crowd something to cheer. The cameras were soon trained on a more familiar figure, former champion john Daly. The trousers more sober than usual, the shotsjust as booming, as he and his playing partners tried golf snooker style. I do not believe it. Others were sticking to conventional methods, with some success. After his superb round yesterday, Danny Willett moved into a share of the lead. Shot of the morning belonged to this man, Yang Guang chunk. A terrible first round yesterday but this might have improved his mood. It is not going in. It is! Right in the middle and! A stroke of brilliance. How the rest would love one of those. The latest I can tell you is that Danny Willett and Zach johnson lead on eight under par. But because of the rain a lot of the late starters, including overnight leader Dustin johnson, will not complete their second round until tomorrow. At Lord’s, on the second day of the Ashes, England’s cricketers might have been hoping for some of that rain. Their bowlers have taken two key wickets this morning. But at lunch Australia are on 1+21+. joe Wilson is there for us. Thing perfectly playable from the Australian point of view. The sun in the sky, every bounce of the ball on the pitch predictable and true. Australia increased their dominance run by Ron. Basically, a grand old day for batting. At Lord’s you are never far from history. The great thing about batting is not to be half-hearted about it, so said WG Grace in 1891. In 2015 batsman looked different. There is a reason Chris Rogers wears a helmet with a modern adaptation, protection near the air full -- year. He was taken by surprise by the first ball of play. There is every reason to take this seriously. By the end of the over Rogers was displaying graceful application. Four more for him and four more for Steve Smith. Their partnership, Australia’s biggest ever at Lord’s. A statue worthy performance. Remember what a dismissal looks like? England’s second wicket nearly 300 runs after their first, Rogers out for 173. Nothing for England to do but keep on keeping on, hoping that good fortune would come along, soon. Please. Here you go. Would bowling, Michael Clarke directing the ball directly to the field, Gary Ballance. 383-3. Steven Smith still going. His personal score advancing beyond 150. There is precious little to help the beleaguered bowler. Australia past 1+00. Steve Smith will resume shortly on 168 not out. We can expect Australia to whack the ball around for a couple of hours. But we will get a true sense of how the Test match may evolve when it is the Australian turn to ball. Many thanks. Now the weather. You have already seen how the weather affected St Andrews from the ground. This is what it looked like from above. A great swathes of cloud. A combination of wet and windy weather. The wind will be a big player on Saturday. And a combination of weather for part of Sunday. Further south, plain sailing at Lord’s. Certainly until Sunday. Some uncertainty about that. In the shorter term, we have got the wet and windy weather close by. It will return to Northern Ireland. Showers looming in the south-west. They could feature across Devon and Cornwall. They will fade away. Old weather fronts still producing cloud in the East. Elsewhere, essentially a settled picture until we come to Northern Ireland. The dry interlude will not last. There is no dry interlude for the Northern Isles, where the temperatures have been depressed by a combination of the stiff wind and the rain. Through the evening that rain gets across Northern Ireland. It tends to become quite confined to the west of Scotland. A fresher night. Saturday that low pressure still close by to the Northern Isles. Notice how the rain is still there. We could be thinking about 80s or a 100 millimetres across the high ground. Northern England and southern Scotland, much improved. A scattering of showers in England and Wales. The wind still a factor in the north, less so in the South. Despite the temperatures, just a hint of freshness about proceedings. Let me take you to Sunday. Initially we were thinking it was going to be just rain for Scotland and Northern Ireland. But we have weather fronts here. Whenever you get three or four together, it is difficult to know how they will interact. Our current feeling is that through the day on Sunday the more northerly feature runs into the North Sea having produced more rain across northern Britain. This is why I say Sunday at ",,

On BBC London: An expert on female genital mutilation fears new laws could push the problem underground. And the justice Secretary suggests Pentonville and other London prisons could be sold off for housing. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. Several large explosions at a wood mill in Cheshire have left four people unaccounted for and four in hospital, one with serious burns. The force of the blasts at Wood Flour mills in Bosley near Macclesfield this morning shook nearby houses. judith Moritz is at the scene for us. Yes, nine hours after this morning cosmic explosions, you can see smoke rising above the mill and across the fields find me. The building, we are told, is still absolutely treacherous. Specialist search and rescue teams who worked in the recent earthquake in Nepal are on site but it is too dangerous for them to get right into the heart of the mill, where three men and one woman remain missing. Curling above the countryside, plumes of smoke belched and billowed into the sky. Fire raged, ripping through the mill, the noise shattering the peace of a quiet Cheshire morning. I heard this massive explosion and there was a fireball coming out of it. The ground was shaking, the walls were shaking. As I turned round, there was another explosion going off. It was like somebody had burst my eardrum, it was that loud. The wood mill workers were just one hour into their morning shift. 35 people were caught in the explosion, with others living just yards away. There was thick smoke coming of everything. Warren’s cottage is right next door. It was like a war zone, everything everywhere. It was raining down, bits of shrapnel, corrugated iron, wood and everything else, actually burning. A major incident was declared, with emergency workers scrambled from six counties. The most badly injured were airlifted to hospital, while the search continued for those who could not be accounted for, their colleagues left waiting for news. Tell me what your worries are? As long as my mates get out alive I’m not bothered. What can you tell us about them, people you have worked with for a long time? A very long time. One of them has not been found yet, and he was like a dad to me at work. That is why I have come UP me at work. That is why I have come up here, to see who has been found, what has happened. The lI-storey building collapsed completely, making the search difficult and dangerous. We have specialist teams, urban search and rescue teams which willjoin us from Greater Manchester and Merseyside Fire Service. They have specialist tools and equipment and knowledge to undertake a methodical search. and knowledge to undertake a methodicalsearch. How methodical search. How long do you expect it to take to get on top of the situation? It is difficult to say. We have pockets of fire throughout the situation. By later, perhaps even in, we will have a full grip and most of the fire will be extinguished. The explosions were so powerful that masonry was flung into the air and metal beams bent out of shape, but the real impact is on the people who stay at work turned into disaster. People in the area say they are traumatised by what has happened. Tonight, we are told that 50 mill workers have lost theirjobs. Others have, at least temporarily, lost their homes. And tonight remains the terrible possibility that more people have lost their lives. New guidelines suggest we should drastically reduce the amount of SUQBF WE COFISUITIE. A Government-appointed committee of scientists suggests we should cut our intake by half- that’s of sugars that are added to food or occur naturally in honey and unsweetened fruit juice. That would mean no more than seven teaspoons of sugar a day, so one can of fizzy drink would be too much for a child under 11. It’s all part of a drive to reduce obesity and diabetes. The head of NHS England has added his voice by calling on leading food retailers to raise prices of sugary drinks. Hugh Pym reports. Sugar used to be a big deal in this family. Every night with our evening meal we would have a fizzy drink, so there would always on the table for us. We have definitely cut back on that. We only have it once a week now. Polly Taylor realised they were consuming far too much sugar. She went on a nutrition course to find out what they should be eating and drinking instead. She has worked hard to make sure they eat a healthy diet, cutting right back on sugar, with only occasional treats. The new guidelines mean you will not be able to have many snacks and treats like these before going over the recommendation of the limit. That means big challenges for all of us trying to work out what should be on the menu. We asked one of the experts involved in today’s report to design a sample meal plan with added sugar kept to a minimum. Breakfast was a banana and wheat biscuits, lunch a wholemeal roll with cheese chutney and salad, and for dinner, bean curry with a treat of chocolate mousse. She admits it will not be easy for everyone. It will be quite a big cultural change in how we eat. These meals need planning, they need people to shop, prepare and cook the meals, to prepare food to take with them when they go to work or school. It is very different to what we’re doing at the moment, and that is before we factor in potential extra costs. So how much responsible T should fall on those who sell food and to? Today, the head of NHS England called on leading retailers to raise prices of these products, to persuade consumers to look at choices. With the extra takings paid out on higher wages for staff. If they reflect the cost in prices they choose to charge for sugary drinks and junk food for kids, this could be a win-win. It will take pounds of the waistline of our children and put pounds in the pockets of low income employees. But food and drink companies hit back this evening, saying his comments were an absolute disgrace and an abuse of his position. Low sugar choices, they said, are widely available in shops. With ministers set to launch a major obesity strategy in the autumn, the role of companies, consumers and the government will be debated. The politics of sugar are getting more bitter. A man has been arrested after a pensioner was stabbed to death in a suspected road rage incident in West Sussex. 79-year-old Don Lock’s car was involved in a crash with another vehicle. The driver of that car got out and stabbed the pensioner repeatedly before driving off. Duncan Kennedy is at the scene for us now. Duncan what more can you tell us? Well, Fiona, all afternoon close members of the family have been here to the scene to pay their respects, to lay their flowers. They included his wife, his daughter and his granddaughter. It comes, as you said, after the arrest in nearby Worthing of a 3l+-year-old man on suspicion of murder. But all day here in this beautiful west Sussex countryside, members of this community have been expressing their shock. This was the traumatised scene tonight with the shattered family gathering under the trees where Don Lock died. There were flowers and embraces for the man who lost his life during a summer evening drive. His wife, Maureen, sharing her heartbreaking tribute. He was a wonderful husband for 55 years. It was on the A2lI last night that medical teams rushed to save the life of 79-year-old Don Lock. A few minutes earlier police said he had been involved in an argument with another driver after a small shunt. They say moments later he died of multiple stab wounds. I looked over to the centre reservation and I could see this chap lying there. I took one look at him and realised he was dead. All day, friends and strangers have been coming to lay flowers. They included john Curtice, who had known Don Lock for 50 years. He would do anything for anyone. You could not wish for a better guy. Unbelievable. This afternoon, police came to this area of Worthing and arrested a 3lI-year-old man on suspicion of murder. They say they are up looking for anyone else in connection with the case. The arrest came as Don Lock’s beloveds cycling fraternity issued a statement. He had been a member of a cycling club for more than 50 years. Club members said simply, Don Lock is irreplaceable. Tonight, Don Lock’s granddaughter and daughter also came, locked in grief, heartache and puzzlement. Bewildered over how their loving father and grandfather could die on the verge of his 80th year, over a minor roadside blemish. Let’s take a brief look at some of the day’s other other news stories. The High Court has ruled that an act passed last year to set out powers on surveillance and data collection is unlawful. Two MPs had brought the unprecedented legal challenge, saying more safeguards were needed to protect innocent people. The Government said it disagreed absolutely with the judgement and said it would appeal. The justice Secretary, Michael Gove, says he’s considering closing some Victorian prisons and selling them off to fund newjails. He says the current prison estate is ""out of date, insanitary and inadequate"". He singled out Pentonville Prison in London as the most dramatic failure. The German parliament has voted in favour of opening detailed talks on the proposed bail out deal for Greece. During an often angry debate, the Chancellor, Angela Merkel, who played a key role in forcing through the deal, told the Bundestag it had been hard for everyone, but that the bail out was needed to avoid chaos. British pilots have been involved in carrying out airstrikes against so-called Islamic State targets in Syria. The Government has confirmed that up to 20 personnel are involved in the mission, embedded with American and Canadian forces. That’s despite a vote in parliament two years ago against British military action there. Here’s Frank Gardner. AUS A US airstrike A US air strike hits and Isis Targett, an almost daily occurrence. US warplanes carry out air strikes across Iraq and Syria. British warplanes are only authorised by Parliament to hit targets in Iraq. So the revelation that British pilots have been taking part in US air strikes in Syria has surprised many. It has emerged that three Royal Navy and Royal Marine pilots have been flying in these aircraft from a US Navy aircraft carrier in the Gulf, part of a bilateral programme to keep up Royal Navy flying skills. The Defence Secretary defended the policy. There is a huge coalition effort going on to ensure that Isil is degraded and defeated in both Iraq and Syria. We don’t have at the moment Parliamentary authority to carry out military strikes in Syria, but the Americans do and they have been, and they have been doing that to keep all of us safe. Two years ago, MPs voted decisively against Britain joining in planned missile strikes against the Syrian regime will stop it is clear to me that the British Parliament, reflecting the views of the British people, does not want to seem British military action. I get that and the Government will act accordingly. There is an important difference between the situation in Syria two years ago and now. Back then, Parliament voted against getting embroiled in Syria’s civil war. It did not want to start a conflict with that country’s government, headed by President Assad. But today, Britain is already at war with so-called Islamic State just across-the-board in Iraq. The orange area here shows their dominance across both Iraq and Syria. There have been extensive US-led attacks against IIS, with these circles showing where there are concentrated, so militarily, the border to Syria makes little difference. But politically, here at home, it does. I am shocked that this has happened without a statement before Parliament or at least a discussion in Parliament. I am not in favour of us being involved in this war. But if the Government gets its way, Britain’s involvement will soon deepen and RAF planes like these tornadoes in Cyprus will be joining US jets planes like these tornadoes in Cyprus will be joining USjets in air strikes over Syria. But Parliament will need to be consulted first. Our top story this evening... A series of explosions at a wood mill in Cheshire leaves four people unaccounted for and another four in hospital. Later on BBC London: The mayor says billions of pounds are needed to construct another huge rail tunnel under London. And Andy Murray levels things up for Great Britain, in their Davis Cup quarter final tie against France. population of the tiny island. And how our staff have been forced to switch to trousers. Ceremonies have been taking place around the world to mark the downing of a Malaysian airliner over eastern Ukraine exactly a year ago. All 298 people on board MH17 were killed, including ten British citizens. A Dutch-led international criminal investigation team has spoken to 140 witnesses, as well as studying tens of thousands of photos and videos. Russian-backed rebels have been widely accused of firing the missile that caused the crash - something Moscow denies. Despite this, fighting continues in Ukraine, particularly in the east, from where Tom Burridge now reports. CHURCH BELL TOLLS They showed a solemn sense of respect. At a service at their village church - for men, women and children who were strangers to this community. And who were killed in the sky above. One year on, local people who witnessed the horror of the aftermath, when Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 was shot down, are still trying to reconcile what happened. This video gives a sense of the carnage and chaos just after the passenger plane was brought down. The pro-Russian rebel soldiers who filmed it are confused about what has happened. ""Our guys have brought down a fighterjet,"" says one man. But later, they realised that this was a civilian aircraft. On that day, this woman heard the explosion and saw parts of the plane drop out of the sky. But when she rushed home, she discovered that a woman’s body had fallen through her roof. A passenger from the plane was lying dead in her kitchen. Today, they honoured the dead. But finding out who was responsible for killing 298 innocent people in a war zone is a hugely complicated task. Away from the genuine sense of grief here, there is a poisonous climate of mistruths and propaganda in this reason, linked to the ongoing conflict. So, even when the Dutch-led international investigation team decides what and who brought the plane down, the nextjob is finding justice for those who died. 20-year-old Ben Pocock from near Bristol was on board the plane. His father, jeremy, says the British government must continue to fight forjustice - for all of the victims who died. We must not lose sight of the fact that their were 80 children on that there were 80 children on that plane, including many babies. Whole families were wiped out, and there were numerous young adults, including Ben, who had barely started their adult lives. In the blink of an eye, it was gone. A year ago, there was an international tragedy here. But Russia and the West back different sides in this region’s war, and they are unlikely to agree on who killed those on board flight MH17. Thousands more pensioners will have to pay for their care after the government decided to delay one of its flagship election promises. Ministers were due to bring in a £72,000 cap on the amount older people are required to pay for their care before the state pays the rest. But the plans, designed to prevent pensioners from having to sell their homes, have been put on hold until 2020. Alison Holt reports. jack Rutherford is 80, and he has Alzheimer’s. His son looked after him for years, but now he needs the support provided by a care home. jack’s own house had to be sold to PPV jack’s own house had to be sold to pay for the £2600 per month costs. The bill was meant to help people like jack, who had worked hard to build up savings which are now being drained. The family says the four year delay has left him on his own. He worked hard, he had his own property, his own private pensions. Whatever you earn and what inheritance you hope to leave for your family, inheritance you hope to leave for yourfamily, that is now gone inheritance you hope to leave for your family, that is now gone to the cost of funding the care homes. At the moment one person in ten aged 65 and over will pay more than £100,000 for care. Reforms, when they eventually come in, will limit that to £72,000. It was estimated originally that one in eight people needing care would benefit. Ministers now say next year is not the right time, even though it was a Conservative manifesto pledge. It is more important to get it right than to stick to a particular date. I except the embarrassment and I recognised that it was in the manifesto, but this is the right thing to do. Social care provides older and vulnerable people with vital help in day-to-day tasks. But councils have been warning that increasing demand from an ageing population and the financial squeeze mean they are facing a crisis. Charities say they accept the delay to the cap, as the funding problems have to be fixed first. It shows how desperate the situation for social care now is. Everyone is worried the system could fall over, so we could not possibly prioritise the care cap right now. Forfamilies not possibly prioritise the care cap right now. For families like this one, the care is vital. Councils hope they will now be able to keep money earmarked for the cap to help them face the problems they could be facing ahead. England’s cricketers are in deep trouble after two days of the second Ashes Test. They began their first innings 566 runs behind the tourists and struggled from the off, on a day that Australia dominated with both bat and ball. Our correspondent joe Wilson reports from Lord’s. At Lord’s, you are never far from history. The great thing about batting is not to be half-hearted about it. So said WG Grace in 1891. In 2015, Steve Smith followed that to the letter. England dropped Smith when he had made a near 50 on Thursday. Second thoughts, try to forget Smith began this series ranked as the world’s best batsman, and was trying to live up to that billing. For the first time now, he reached 200. joe Root, who else, finally got Smith out. He’d made 215. But a wicket is still a wicket. After a serene day, Steve Smith headed to the dressing room. He knew there were other batsmen to come. Oops! Well, Australia finally stopped with a total of 566. Then theyjust needed to settle down and take wickets. Second ball, first one - Adam Lyth gone. Starc is that bowler. This one isjohnson. Ballance gone. Suddenly, Australia looked like the team we have seen in the last Ashes, and so did England. Bell clean bowled by Hazelwood for one. Never mind batting half-hearted. Try batting brokenhearted. joe Root out, Mitchelljohnson a hero. England have moved on to 84-4. Some resistance from Alastair Cook, and from Ben Stokes, who has hit a six. You may have heard of the famous Lord’s slope. At the weekend, England have a long, long journey ahead of them, and it will be uphill all the way. Play finally got under way on day two at the Open Golf Championship at St Andrews this morning after a three-hour delay due to heavy rain. Fairways and bunkers were flooded and a small army of greenkeepers deployed to clear the standing water. As for the leaderboard, the early player setting the pace is little- known Englishman Danny Willetts. Here’s our sports correspondent Andy Swiss. Nice weather for ducks, but not for birdies. The fairways were transformed into paddling pools. The result was a 3.5 hour delay. The water hazards got a refill. But the hardy few who braved it out were soon rewarded. Astonishingly, by 10am, they were playing, and in the case of Sheffield’s Danny Willett, playing rather well. He is ranked 39th in the world, but he charged to the top of the leaderboard. So, how does it feel to set the pace? It is pretty cool. Leading the Open, it is what you dream of doing, for us Brits especially, it is THE Major. And here at the home of golf, it is more special. And it was a good day for the British challenge. Scotland’s Marc Warren also rode into contention. justin Rose, a man who knows all about winning Major titles, was using every ounce of that expertise. But the shot of the day belonged to this man, Liang Tom from China. He had a terrible day yesterday, but this might have lightened his mood. How the rest would love one of those, with conditions expected to get trickier. The latest I can tell you is that Danny Willett ‘s is still leading the way on nine under par. Because of the rain delay, a lot of the big names have onlyjust started their second round, and this wind is getting stronger all the time, which is not good news for them. Time for a look at the weather. What about that rain in Scotland? This was the scene at St Andrews, on the 18th. And this was in Persia. So much rain, the streets were turning into torrent. -- Perthshire. 750 people without power at one stage as well. Tomorrow, for the golfers, it will not be rain, withjust a couple of shelves, but rather it will be the wind which they will have to contend with. Most areas will be dry overnight tonight. Gusts in excess of 50mph in western Scotland. Tomorrow morning, gusts up to 50mph again. The breeze picking up further south. just one or two showers by the end of the night in western parts of England and Wales. Feeling fresher than in recent nights. It should be a fine start tomorrow morning for England and Wales. Northern Ireland having a better day. One or two showers in southern Scotland, the most persistent rain in the far north-west. Temperatures tomorrow, towards the south, it will be 20-25, without the humanity of recent days. Across the north, the temperatures tempered by the strength of the wind. The wind will ease on Saturday night. Saturday evening should be fine for many. There could be a bit of cloudy, damp conditions on Sunday morning. Southernmost counties, there should be rain on and off throughout the day on Sunday, some of them heavy. Not exactly the British summer weather you really wanted to see. For something a bit warmer, head to the Mediterranean. Blue skies overhead and high temperatures as well. A series of explosions at a wood mill in Cheshire have left four people unaccounted for, and another four in hospital. New guidelines suggest we should cut the amount of sugar we consume by half. That’s all from the BBC News at Six. So it’s goodbye from me, On the programme tonight: Britain’s leading expert on female genital mutilation fears new laws could push the practice underground. What we need to be doing is working with the practising community, reaching out to raise more awareness rather than sending them underground. Also tonight: The justice Secretary suggests Pentonville and other London prisons could be sold off for housing. The Ramadan rush: How the muslim festival of Eid gets London’s tills ringing. Plus... It’s the 120th year of the Proms. And we’ve found a superfan who won’t miss a moment. As many as I can, but I have to play it by ear, I am a bit wobbly now. Welcome to BBC London News, with me, Riz Lateef. Some people call the school summer holidays - ""the cutting season"". It’s the time of the year when young girls from some African and Middle Eastern communities get sent abroad for female genital mutilation or FGM. Today laws came into force aimed at preventing the practice and already police in Luton have used the new powers. But as Tarah Welsh reports there are some concerns that new legislation may actually prevent people from seeking help. The start of the school holidays means freedom, and fun for most children. Others it means the summer means being taken abroad for a procedure to change them for ever. When this girl was six years old she had her genitals cut in Somalia. Her family threw a party for the event. You could do what whatever you want, you were showered with affection, you were told nice things about you and all that, but nobody ever explains the horror you will go to see under the next day, how you will feel afterwards. Despite the devastating effect it can have, many ",,

British pilots carry out air strikes in Syria with US forces - MPs demand to know why they weren’t told. The government insists the strikes do not contravene a vote in parliament against military action in Syria. This is different. These are a handful of British pilots who’ve been embedded with American forces and are part of an American military operation for which the Americans have full approval. But MPs across the political spectrum demand to know why parliament wasn’t informed. Also tonight: A series of explosions at a wood mill in Cheshire leaves four people feared dead and another four in hospital. Tributes to a pensioner stabbed to death in a suspected road rage incident- a man has been arrested. The Government shelves its election pledge to cap the cost of care for the elderly to £72,000. And Root’s exposed as England’s batsmen collapse in the Ashes. Later on BBC London: Police investigate reports that dozens of girls have been flown from the UK to Somalia for female genital mutilation. And the London prisons which could be sold off for housing. Good evening. British pilots have been involved in carrying out air strikes against so-called Islamic State targets in Syria. The Government has confirmed that up to 20 personnel are involved in the mission - embedded with American and Canadian forces. That’s despite a vote in parliament two years ago against British military action there. The Defence Secretary Michael Fallon defended the exchange of troops, saying it was ""standard operating practice"". But there’s been criticism from across the political spectrum that Parliament should have been informed. Here’s our security correspondent, Frank Gardner. A US air strike hits an Isis target - an almost daily occurrence. US warplanes carry out air strikes across both Iraq and Syria. British warplanes are only authorised by Parliament to hit targets in Iraq. So the revelation that British pilots have been taking part in the US air strikes in Syria has surprised many. It’s emerged that three Royal Navy and Royal Marine pilots have been flying over Syria in American aircraft, F/A-18s, from a US Navy aircraft carrier in the Gulf, part of a bilateral programme to keep up Royal Navy flying skills. The Defence Secretary has defended the overall policy. There’s a huge coalition effort going on to ensure that Isil is degraded and defeated in both Iraq and in Syria. We don’t have at the moment Parliamentary authority to carry out military strikes in Syria, but the Americans do, and they have been, and they’ve been doing that to keep all of us safe. Two years ago MPs voted decisively against Britainjoining in planned US missile strikes against the Syrian regime. There is an important difference between the situation in Syria two years ago and now. Back then, Parliament voted against getting embroiled in Syria’s civil war. It didn’t want to start a conflict with that country’s government, headed by President Assad. But today, Britain is already at war with IS, so-called Islamic State, just across the border in Iraq. The orange area here shows their dominance across both Iraq and Syria. There have been extensive US-led air attacks against IS. These circles here show where they are concentrated. So militarily the border into Syria makes little difference. But politically, here at home, it does matter. Opposition figures say they’ve been kept in the dark. They want an immediate explanation. Well, I think the Prime Minister needs to make an urgent statement about what’s happening. We’ve never been told this. Parliament has not been told this. And given the huge sensitivities around Britain’s role in terms of both Iraq and Syria, it’s extremely important. It’s a dramatic revelation. It’s extremely concerning. There are two issues of course. One is that we are still involved in bombing in Syria, but the second and pertinent issue is whether the government is actively defying the will of Parliament in the vote two years ago. If the government gets its way, Britain’s military involvement will deepen even further. RAF planes like these ageing Tornadoes in Cyprus will soon join USjets in air strikes over Syria. But given the reaction to today’s revelations, that may now be harder to push through Parliament. Let’s speak to our political correspondent Ross Hawkins, who’s at Westminster. The MoD are claiming this is just business as usual, but some MPs are very angry about this. They are, and opposition figures have been demanding answers all day. I’m told the Ministry of Defence has formally notified the Parliamentary authorities that their will at the very least be a written statement on Monday. There is every chance we hear from the defence Secretary himself. If we do, he won’t come to Parliament in the spirit of apology. He will not rule out these arrangements in future. That matters, because senior influential Conservative figures think the government has mishandled this. They have concerns it’s not showing Parliament the respect they think it deserves and all of that will matter because there is every chance that within months, possibly in the autumn, we could see a crucial vote on whether there is every chance that within months, possibly in the autumn, we could see a crucial vote on whether by the British in Syria. If that were the case, ministers want the support of their own side and the opposition. If they are going to achieve that, they will have to work hard next week to win back the heartland minds that were lost with the revelations this morning. Several large explosions at a wood mill in Cheshire have left four people feared dead and another four in hospital, one with serious burns. The force of the blasts at Wood Treatment Ltd in Bosley near Macclesfield this morning shook nearby houses. judith Moritz reports. Curling above the countryside, plumes of smoke belched and billowed into the sky. Fire raged, ripping through the mill, the noise shattering the peace of a quiet Cheshire morning. I heard a big massive explosion and it was like a fireball coming out of it. The ground was shaking, the walls were shaking, and as I turned back round there was like another explosion going off. The sound, it was like somebody had burst my eardrum. It was that loud. The wood mill workers were just an hour into their morning shift. 35 people were caught in the explosion, with others living just yards away. There was a thick pall of smoke coming over everything. Warren Van Leeuwen’s cottage is right next door. I opened the door and it was like a war zone. There was everything everywhere. It was still raining down then, bits of shrapnel, if you like, bits of corrugated iron, wood and everything else, you know. It was actually burning. A major incident was declared, with emergency workers scrambled from six counties. The most badly injured were airlifted to hospital, whilst searches continued for those who couldn’t be accounted for, their colleagues left waiting for news. Can you tell me what your worries are now? As long as my mates get out of there alive, I’m not bothered. What can you tell us about them, are they people you have worked with for a long time? Yeah, a very long time. Very worried, I’ve got one of them that hasn’t been found yet and he was like a dad to me at work, so that’s why I’ve come up here, to see what happened. The four-storey building collapsed completely, making the search difficult and dangerous. When you have two explosions within the building, the building splits open from the inside and as a result of our firefighting tactics over a course of two or three hours the building collapsed on itself, so it’s extremely difficult and challenging for those fire crews. Rescue teams who worked in the Nepalese earthquake will search their way through this tomorrow. Tonight, livelihoods are gone and it looks increasingly likely that lives have been lost too. A man has been arrested after a pensioner was stabbed to death in a suspected road rage incident in West Sussex. 79-year-old Don Lock’s car was involved in a crash with another vehicle. Duncan Kennedy reports. Under a tree in the Sussex countryside, Don Lock’s close family gathered by the road where he died. There were flowers and embraces for the man who lost his life during a summer evening’s drive. His wife Maureen shared her heartbreaking tribute. He was a wonderful husband for 55 years. It was on the A2lI last night that medical teams tried to save 79-year-old Don Lock. Police say he had been involved in a suspected road rage incident with another driver, after Mr Lock went into the back of the man’s car. They say a few moments later Mr Lock was dead from multiple stab wounds. I walked a matter of yards down the grass verge and looked over to the central reservation and I could see this chap lying there. I didn’t want to look at him when I realised he was dead. This afternoon, armed police came to this area of Worthing and arrested a 3lI-year-old man on suspicion of murder. They say they are not looking for anyone else in connection with this case. The arrests came as Mr Lock’s beloved cycling fraternity issued a statement. He’d been a member of Worthing’s Excelsior Cycling Club for more than 50 years. One member of the club out riding tonight at the scene said he’d known Don for Ao years and said he was the club’s inspiration. Don was such a nice man, always a life enhancing character and a joy. It’s just a tragedy, a total tragedy really. Don’s grand daughter Kirsty and daughter Sandra also came today, embraced in grief. His family said he’d onlyjust been given the all clear from cancer and had been looking forward to welcoming his sixth great-grandchild. The High Court has ruled that an act passed last year setting out powers on data collection is unlawful. Two MPs had brought the challenge, saying more safeguards were needed to protect innocent people. The government has said it will appeal. There have been funerals for eight of the 30 Britons killed in the Tunisia beach massacre today. Among today’s ceremonies was a joint funeral for three members of the same family - joel Richards, who was 19, his uncle Adrian Evans, and the teenager’s grandfather, Charles Patrick Evans. The German Parliament has voted in favour of opening detailed talks on the proposed bailout deal for Greece. But there were angry exchanges in the debate as the Chancellor Angela Merkel insisted the bailout was needed to avoid chaos. Dozens of her own MPs voted against the measure. Our Europe editor Katya Adler is in Berlin tonight - the end of a critical week for Greece. After this vote in the Bundestag, now the detailed negotiations about the bailout begin. That’s right. We have come a long way this week, since that stormy all-night meeting between Eurozone leaders, when there were those huge rifts on display between key powers Germany and France. What brought Germany back from the brink then was the prospect of Europe divided and weakened over Greece. This country has invested hugely in the European project since World War II as part of its European reintegration. So when the German chancellor stood in front of Parliament arguing for a third bail out over Greece, she did that in the name of European unity and German self-interest. She said, if Europe is doing well, Germany does well. While outside Germany this country is criticised for not showing enough pity towards Greece, here at Chancellor Merkel has to persuade people that she is not a soft touch. Germany is the biggest contributor to rescue packages for Greece and that worries German taxpayers. Angela Merkel’s secret weapon is her hardline finance minister. His uncle Mike -- uncorrupt -- minister. His uncle Mike -- uncorrupt -- and compromising stands led to him being described as Germany’s most popular popular addition and if it were not for him that rebellion would have been far larger. New guidelines suggest we should drastically reduce the amount of SUQBF WE COFISUITIE. A government appointed committee of scientists suggests we should cut our intake by half- that’s of sugars that are added to food or occur naturally in honey and unsweetened fruit juice. That would mean no more than seven teaspoons of sugar a day - so one can of fizzy drink would be too much for a child under 11. It’s all part of a drive to reduce obesity and diabetes. The head of NHS England has added his voice, by calling on leading food retailers to raise prices of sugary drinks. Our health editor Hugh Pym reports. Sugar used to be a big deal in this family. Every night with our evening meal we used to have fizzy drink. There would always be a lemonade on the table for us. We’ve definitely cut back on that. We only have one once a week now. Hollie Taylor realised they were all consuming far too much sugar. She went on a nutrition course to find out what they should be eating and drinking instead. She’s worked hard to make sure they have a healthy diet, cutting right back on sugar. What the new guidelines mean is that you won’t to be able to have many snacks and treats like these in a day before going over the recommended sugar limit. And that means big challenges for all of us trying to work out what should be on the menu. We asked one of the experts involved in today’s report to design a sample meal plan with added sugar kept to a minimum. Breakfast was a banana and wheat biscuits, lunch a wholemeal roll with cheese, chutney and salad, and for dinner, bean curry with a treat of chocolate mousse. She admits it won’t be easy for everyone. It will require a big cultural change in how we eat. These meals do need planning, they need people to shop, to prepare and cook the meals, to prepare food to take with them when they go to work or school. So it is very different to what we’re doing at the moment, and that’s before we factor in the potential extra costs. So how much responsibility should fall on those who sell sugary food and drink? Today, the head of NHS England called on leading retailers to raise prices of these products to persuade consumers to look at healthy choices, with the extra takings paid out on higher wages for staff. If they reflect the cost of that in the prices that they choose to charge for sugary drinks and junk food to kids, then this could be a win-win. It will take pounds off the waistline of our children and put pounds in the pockets of low income employees. But food and drink companies hit back this evening, saying Mr Stevens’ comments were an absolute disgrace and an abuse of his position. Low sugar choices, they said, are widely available in shops. With ministers set to launch a major obesity strategy in the autumn, the role of companies, consumers and the Government will be debated. The politics of sugar are getting more bitter. Hugh Pym, BBC News. Ceremonies have been taking place around the world to mark the downing of a Malaysian airliner over eastern Ukraine exactly a year ago. All 298 people on board MH17 were killed -- including ten British citizens. A Dutch-led international criminal investigation team has spoken to 140 witnesses as well as studying tens of thousands of photos and videos. Russian-backed rebels have been widely accused of firing the missile that caused the crash - something Moscow denies. Despite this, fighting continues in Ukraine - particularly in the east- from where Tom Burridge now reports. In their village church, the people that witnessed the horror of the aftermath when a Malaysian Airlines plane was shot down, paid their respects to the innocent men, women and children on board who were strangers to this community, which a year on is still trying to reconcile what happened. This video gives a sense of the carnage and chaos just after the passenger plane was brought down. The pro-Russian rebel soldiers who filmed it are confused about what has happened. On that day, this woman heard the explosion and saw parts of the plane drop out of the sky. But when she rushed home, she discovered that a woman’s body had fallen through her roof. Today, they honoured the dead. But finding out who was responsible for killing 298 innocent people in a war zone is a hugely complicated task. Away from the genuine sense of grief here, there is a poisonous climate of mistruths and propaganda in this region linked to the ongoing conflict. So even when the Dutch-led international investigation team decides what and who brought the plane down, the next hurdle is finding justice for those who died. 20-year-old Ben Pocock from near Bristol was on board the plane. His father, jeremy, says the British Government must continue to fight forjustice for all of the victims who died. We mustn’t lose sight of the fact that there were 80 children on that plane, including many babies. Whole families were wiped out and there were numerous young adults, including Ben, who had barely started their adult lives, and in the blink of an eye was gone. Today, the pro-Russian rebels in charge of this area made sure that lots of their flags were flying at an event of remembrance by the main crash site. This was an international tragedy, but Russia and the West back different sides in this region’s war and they are unlikely to agree on who killed those on board flight MH17 and how to implement justice. Tom Burridge, BBC News, in eastern Ukraine. Bridget Kendall is with me. The conflict in Ukraine has rather fallen out of the headlines but the fighting there is still going on. That’s right. There is supposed to be a ceasefire and heavy weapons drawn back from both sides. But they are still fighting each other at a low level. There are 61+,000 Ukrainian soldiers in that part of Ukraine, facing a smaller number of rebels, but they are very well equipped and they have the Russians backing them, and more Russian troops in a big build-up on the Russian side of the border. Every day there are clashes, sometimes quite fierce fighting. Pretty well every day there are people dying and being injured, and it doesn’t feel as though the ceasefire is really holding. At the same time, there is also supposed to be a peace plan being worked through. This afternoon the Russian president, the Ukrainian president and the French and German leaders had a telephone conversation to assess progress. The next thing they are trying to do is arrange partial self rule for the rebels in this area in eastern Ukraine but it is getting bogged down in squabbles. The Russians say what the Ukrainians are doing is not serious. The Ukrainians say they cannot implement this until the rebels get credible lead is through new elections. You can’t have that while it is a war zone. All the time, with the fighting simmering and this stand-off, this frozen conflict people talk about, not that frozen, the real worry is there could be some new crisis, another plane shot down or something, which could escalate the fighting. Then the danger is that already now the Russians are so involved with the rebels and the Americans and Europeans are actually training some Ukrainian soldiers, what if this escalation turns into a conflict between Russia and the West? Thousands more pensioners will have to pay for their care after the Government decided to delay one of its flagship election promises. Ministers were due to bring in a £72,000 cap on the amount older people are required to pay for their care before the state pays the rest. But the plans, designed to prevent pensioners from having to sell their homes, have been put on hold until 2020. Alison Holt reports. jack Rutherford is 80, and he has Alzheimer’s. Are you cold? It is cold. His son looked after him for years, but now he needs the support provided by a care home. jack’s own house had to be sold to pay the £2600 a month it costs. The cap on care costs was meant to help people like jack, who, with his wife, worked hard for years to build up savings which are now being drained. His family says the four-year delay leaves him on his own. He’s worked hard all his life, he had his own property, his own private pensions. Whatever you earn and whatever inheritance you hope to leave for your family, that is now gone to the cost of funding the care homes. At the moment one person in ten aged 65 and over will pay more than £100,000 for care. The reforms, when they eventually come in, will limit that to £72,000. It was estimated that one in every eight people needing care would benefit. Ministers say it’s not the right time to introduce the cap next year, even though it was a Conservative manifesto pledge. It is much more important to get it right than to stick to a particular date. I accept the embarrassment and I recognise that it was in the manifesto, but this is the right thing to do. Social care provides older and vulnerable people with vital help with day-to-day tasks. But councils have been warning for some time that increasing demand from an ageing population and the financial squeeze mean they are facing a crisis. Charities say they accept the delay to the cap, as the funding problems have to be fixed first. It’s a reflection ofjust how desperate the situation for social care is. Everyone is worried the system could actually fall over, so we could not possibly prioritise a care cap right now. For families like the Rutherfords, care is vital. Councils now hope they will be able to keep money earmarked for the cap to ease the problems they face. Alison Holt, BBC News. England’s cricketers are in deep trouble after two days of the second Ashes Test. They will continue batting in the morning, four wickets down and still trailing the tourists by 1+81 runs, after a day that Australia dominated with both bat and ball, asjoe Wilson reports from Lord’s. Stunned and staggered, they wandered home from Lord’s and wondered, is it the last Ashes returned? First job here for Australia, build massive score. Steve Smith wasjust in the mood for thatjob. He finished with 215. Take that. Well, Australia got to 566, stopped batting and started bowling. Be brave, or look away now. Second ball, first wicket. Adam Lyth gone. Starc is that bowler. This one isjohnson, Ballance out. Suddenly Australia looked like the team we’d seen in the last Ashes, and so did England. Bell clean bowled by Hazelwood for one. joe Root, out, and that’s the Mitchelljohnson who ripped through England 18 months ago. Reminded me of the last Ashes and is bound to have reminded some of the England batsmen of the last Ashes, too, isn’t it? I hope so. That would be nice, to have those scars come back out. This is familiar, too, Ben Stokes still attacking. England will resume 1+81 behind. There’s still loads of time for famous resistance. joe Wilson, BBC News, Lord’s. Play has onlyjust ended on day two at the Open golf championship at St Andrews. At the top of the leaderboard, America’s Dustinjohnson, with a one shot lead over England’s Danny Willett. The late finish came after a three-hour delay due to heavy rain. Fairways and bunkers were flooded and a small army of greenkeepers deployed to clear the standing water. Here’s Andy Swiss. Nice weather for ducks, but not for birdies. St Andrews awoke to a golf course more like a paddling pool. The result, a three-hour delay and an almighty mop up. But by mid-morning they were playing, and in the case of Sheffield’s Danny Willett, playing rather well. He has done it. He led for a while but the big names were after him. America’s Dustinjohnson edged him out at the top of the leaderboard. He, like TigerWoods, though, will have to finish his round tomorrow. Slightly better from Woods but still set to miss the cut. Others, though, had a more memorable day. Sir Nick Faldo, playing his last ever Open at St Andrews. Some farewell. And clad in his 1987 Open-winning sweater, a highly emotional one. But for both players and organisers this has been an often challenging day, and with a forecast for strong winds, tomorrow could be even trickier. Andy Swiss, BBC News, St Andrews. That’s all from us. Now, it’s time for the news where you are. Good evening and welcome. I’m Alice Bhandhukravi. Scotland Yard are investigating reports that at least 50 girls have been taken from the UK to Somalia for female genital mutilation.

But as Tarah Welsh reports, there are some concerns that new legislation may actually prevent people from seeking help.

His comments are the clearest indication yet he wants a vote in Parliament, to allow British bombing raids backing up US forces. We know that we have to defeat ISIL, we have to destroy this caliphate, whether it is in Iraq or Syria, that is a key part of defeating this terrorist scourge that we face. Police say they’ve found a body, in the search for four people missing after a devastating fire at a wood processing plant in Cheshire. We are dying. People are dying. What is the government doing for us? We don’t know. We return to Sierra Leone to discover the devastating legacy of Ebola for one survivor. Bowled him! That is the one Australia wanted! And England slump to one of their worst defeats in history, as Australia comfortably win the second Ashes Test at Lord’s. Good evening. David Cameron has indicated the Government is likely to seek approval from Parliament, for British forces to attack so-called Islamic State militants in Syria, as well as in Iraq. Speaking on American television, he said the UK is committed to working with Washington to destroy IS. But his remarks have attracted criticism, as our political correspondent, Chris Mason, reports. Iraqi soldiers taking on so-called Islamic State, or ISIL, in Anbar Province in Iraq. They currently get support from British air strikes, strikes that don’t extend into Syria, at least yet. We know that we have to defeat ISIL, we have to destroy this caliphate, whether it is in Iraq, or in Syria, that is a key part of defeating this terrorist scourge that we face. I want Britain to do more. I’ll always have to take my Parliament with me. We are talking and discussing at the moment. The noes to the left... David Cameron is making his case carefully because two years ago, his plans to bomb President Assad’s regime in Syria were defeated. And so, this time, the Defence Secretary has already set out his argument for striking targets in Syria and so too has the Prime Minister. But one senior Conservative MP told the BBC today that David Cameron was making up his approach to Syria on the hoof and instead, needed a coherent strategy. At the moment, both the SNP and the Liberal Democrats are unconvinced, too. As for Labour, three of those running to be its next leader said they were open to David Cameron’s idea, but... Is it in line with international law? Is there a clear military objective and a clear moral objective? It would have to be part of a much broader and wider political strategy in the region. We haven’t seen the Government’s case, but I don’t want Labour to sit on the sidelines... Only left-wingerjeremy Corbyn is definitely opposed. I would not support the bombing of Syria. What I would support is choking off arms supplies and finances for ISIL. Questions are already being asked as to whether extending British air strikes to Syria is enough. One former head of the Armed Forces suggested ground troops and tanks would eventually be needed. There is an old military adage - if you are going to go to war, do it properly. It is shortened to clout, don’t dribble. The critics of the existing strategy, without wishing to reduce the importance of this, would accuse of us of too much dribbling and not enough clouting. British forces are training troops fighting IS, but there is no immediate prospect of the UK being involved in an all-out war. Our political correspondent, Chris Mason, is at Westminster. NumberTen is saying Number Ten is saying David Cameron’s comments are part of a wide-ranging strategy to defeat Islamic State terrorism? Yes, Clive, if the focus was on facing up to IS in the Middle East, tomorrow the Prime Minister’s focus will switch to the domestic agenda. A big speech from David Cameron on the whole issue of extremism. His aides saying the biggest he has ever given on this topic. The language will be very, very strong, as he sets out his long-term strategy. He will make the arguments that people who are drawn in to Islamic State can become cannon fodder, there is nothing respectable about it, people instead will be abused. He will make the argument again and again, that this is a generational struggle, that there is a sad truth, he’ll say, that some people born and bred here can’t identify with Britain and winning them round will take some time. I’m told we will get some new policies from the Prime Minister tomorrow. What I can tell you tonight is that both militarily and diplomatically, as well as domestically, this all boils down to one word - domestically, this all boils down to one word - that word is persuasion. There’s lots of it to be done. Chris Mason, thank you. A judith Moritz is there. In the last few minutes, a body has been discovered. It is not known which of the four missing mill workers it is. They went to work and didn’t return. 62-year-old Derek Moore. William Barks, 51. Dorothy Bailey, 62. And jason Shingler, 38. He’s a nice, pleasant, quiet gentleman. jason’s next door neighbour is Neil Williams. He says he doesn’t want to think the worst. There is always hope. And for the families as well, always make sure you always hope because it might be something that might happen and they might bring them out alive. Search teams are working around-the-clock clearing broken brick and twisted metal, to get to where the mill workers are thought to be. Tonight has come the news that one body has been found, though it is yet to be identified. Our hearts, our thoughts and prayers go out to those who are still waiting, waiting for news. Villagers who are suffering together, this morning prayed together, too. Everybody has been connected in some way with this. Families - there’s nobody who doesn’t know someone, who hasn’t spent time in that area. It’s devastating. Bosley’s two churches joined together for the special service. The windows were blown out in our Methodist church which is next door to wood treatment, so we couldn’t have our service there this morning, but we needed to band together any way with the people of Bosley. I don’t often come to church and it’s this that’s brought me and that is a very sad reason, really. At the mill, searches will continue overnight with investigators working to find the cause of the blast and the public is rallying to help, too, with thousands of pounds raised already in charitable donations. The Cheshire Police say that although the body hasn’t been positively identified, the four families waiting for news are all being given support and kept up-to-date with information as they have it. judith, thank you. A man has been charged with the murder of a 79-year-old motorist, in an apparent road rage incident earlier this week. Matthew Daly, who’s 34, is charged with killing Don Lock, a retired solicitor, on the AZA at Findon near Worthing. He’ll appear before magistrates tomorrow. Police in Northern Ireland say a bomb which exploded in Lurgan last night was designed to kill. They say officers were lured to the area by a phone call but no-one was injured in the explosion. At the time the police were also attacked with petrol bombs. In Yemen there’s been heavy fighting near the port of Aden, leaving at least A3 people dead and more than a hundred injured. It’s thought Shi’ite Houthi rebels shelled the area, after losing control of parts of the city to pro-government forces. NHS patients in England should get the results of cancer tests within four weeks of being referred for them under new proposals to improve treatment. The target - part of a new strategy to improve cancer survival rates - will come into effect by 2020. Some experts say the changes could save 30,000 lives a year, though others have questioned whether the health service can afford it. Our health editor, Hugh Pym, has more. john Marsh feels he’s very fortunate. He took a routine bowel cancer screening and to his surprise, it showed he needed further testing which resulted in surgery to remove a tumour. Since then, he’s needed regular checks, but the cancer hasn’t returned. If I hadn’t done the test, because I had no symptoms, I wouldn’t have known I had bowel cancer, so every day it would have been getting bigger in my body and so it would have been more difficult to treat when eventually there were visible symptoms and my chances of surviving would have been much lower. Today’s report aims to encourage more early diagnosis, as injohn’s case, which is good for patients, and saves the NHS money, because early treatment is more straightforward. The Task Force sets out plans for quicker cancer testing, with a commitment to all test results within four weeks, help for GPs to order more tests directly rather than going through a specialist, and a helpline to refer patients who call in with certain symptoms straight to testing. A key part of the strategy is investment in new equipment and recruitment of more specialist staff, but the big question is, where’s the money going to come from, at a time when NHS finances are under pressure and there are increasing demands on its budget? NHS chiefs believe it is affordable from the money already promised by the Government. The Health Service overall is going to require continued investment by the British people and, alongside that, we will have to make new efficiencies. Put those two together, that will give us the head room to make the kinds of improvements in cancer services that this Task Force report calls for. But some experts, whilst welcoming the strategy, say it is too optimistic about what can be achieved with the money available. Until we get more people employed to do the expert work of interpreting scans, more consultant radiologists, we won’t see the improvements that the strategy is looking for. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all have their own cancer strategies. The four-week diagnosis policy isn’t applied anywhere in the UK. The devolved administrations will take note of this report as they face up to the same challenges as England - an aging population and a steady increase in the numbers diagnosed with cancer each year. Hugh Pym, BBC News. And there’s lots more information on developments in cancer detection and treatments on the BBC website at bbc.co.uk/cancer. In Greece, banks are due to re-open tomorrow after three weeks of closure. It comes after the Greek Parliament passed austerity measures, which start to be implemented in the coming week. Our correspondent, Mark Lowen, is in Athens for us. Mark, what do we expect to happen tomorrow when the banks re-open? Are there still restrictions, capital controls for customers? There are. Even though they are in place, I think there will be a bit of a rush here at these banks tomorrow morning. It is possible that the queues that have formed outside every morning for the last three weeks will move inside as people scramble to make the transactions that they have been unable to make for three weeks. The restrictions are in place. There are weekly withdrawal limits of 1+20 euros, you won’t be able to open new accounts, or cash cheques, at least the banks will be open. That is because the Greek Parliament passed those austerity measures last Wednesday, the first of those will bite tomorrow. VAT will rise from 13% to 23% on restaurants, transport and other goods as well. So businesses will feel pain, but there will, it is hoped, to be a sense of normality that will return. I wouldn’t hold your breath. The capital controls will last for some time. In Cyprus, they lasted for two years and in Iceland, they have only recently been lifted after being in place for seven years. Mark Lowen, thank you. The Ebola outbreak in West Africa killed more than 11,000 people in the past year. But at least 16,000 have survived. Many of those who’ve recovered face psychological problems from the trauma they have been through and ongoing medical issues. The BBC’s global health correspondent, Tulip Mazumdar, has returned to Sierra Leone to see one survivor, Lucinda Samuka, who she first met almost a year ago as the outbreak devastated her family. Looking back on the day Lucinda’s world starting falling apart... 'His bloodshot eyes, a classic sign of Ebola.' ..when her dying brother Francis was turned away from a full treatment centre. That Sunday, at the height of the outbreak, we filmed her family’s desperate situation. What is the government doing for us? We are dying. People are dying. What is the government doing for us? We don’t know. It was so sad, so I feel each time I talk about that, I feel the emotion, you know, it’ not easy. Francis was seriously ill. just press it into your hands and wash. Five gloves for each of you. With nothing to protect themselves with at that time, they were all at risk. 'The family are leaving now. They are not sure where they are going to go to yet. They are completely and utterly bewildered.' We go to different hospital, they said there was no bed, so, by the end of the day, we lose Francis by then because there was no care. Francis’s infection set off a chain of death, killing two of his brothers in the car that day. His children and his parents also died. Lucinda, too, was infected. They wanted to take me to the mortuary. They had already wrapped me in the bag they use to wrap people that are dead in Ebola, but then I came back to life. You must be a very strong person to come back from that? Yes. Yes, I have confidence that I will not die. Lucinda now helps run a survivors’ group. We have so many survivors that are blind because that is the post-Ebola syndrome. As Sierra Leone tries to move on, there are still many unknowns for the thousands who have recovered from Ebola. Research is under way looking at whether male survivors could be transmitting the virus through sexual contact. Health officials say the recent re-emergence of Ebola in Liberia probably came from a survivor. After coming back from the brink of death, Lucinda says she faces another battle, isolation and stigma. It’s not really easy. It only takes the grace of God to leave. Ebola will not kill me, never. I’m just doing that to encourage myself that all is not lost. Tulip Mazumdar, BBC News, Freetown. With news of an extraordinary defeat for England’s cricketers, and the rest of today’s sport, here’s Ore Oduba at the BBC Sport Centre. Australia have levelled the Ashes series at 1-1, beating England by 1+05 runs in the second Test at Lord’s. How did Australia go from the defeated to the victorious so overwhelmingly? Alastair Cook would love to know. Australia’s one concern was Chris Rogers who felt dizzy. Team-mates believe it is not related to recent times he’s been hit by the ball. Rogers watched England’s second innings, a decent prescription. England’s innings began with a collapse. 509 to win, they didn’t get beyond the starting line. Changes to the line-up may follow. There were players who have stood up strongly for England, Ben Stokes is one. He won’t ever want to repeat his dismissal. He got to the other end, he didn’t ground his bat and run out. Moeen Ali was the seventh wicket to fall. james Anderson the last man out and England were all out for 103 in 37 overs. Is that acceptable? It’s not a good performance over the last four days. All credit to Australia, from the first morning they got on top of us and never let us back in the game. It is not good enough, not acceptable and not up to the standard that the guys can play. Remember, in the Ashes it is 1-1 with three Tests to come. At the end of this match, Australia’s captain confirmed to me that, for him, this performance will set the tone for the rest of the summer to come. joe Wilson, BBC News, Lord’s. Great Britain are into the semifinals of the Davis Cup for the first time in 31+ years. Andy Murray beat Gilles Simon of France in the decisive rubber to clinch an unassailable 3-1 win in the tie. It sets up a semifinal for Great Britain for the first time since 1981. They’ll face Australia in September for a shot at the final. There are few occasions in tennis as colourful as a Davis Cup decider. That was the picture that greeted Andy Murray and the captain at Oueen’s. Friends of the French Open -- French opponent making their feelings clear. It is in such environments the British number one thrives. He fought back to win a thrilling tie-break. Those earlier signs of tiredness replaced now only with passion and brilliance. That is magnificent. Murray once again finding the crowd-pleasing shots, in the final set he was dominant. A first Davis Cup semifinal in 31+ years awaits. Now, just expect that excitement to keep growing. An Irish amateur is leading the Open as the delayed third round comes to an end at St Andrews. Paul Dunne went round in 6-under par today, and is 12-under overall, tieing for the lead with Louis Oosthuizen and jason Day. Chris Froome has maintained his overall lead at the Tour de France after Stage 15. Andre Greipel won the stage with an impressive sprint as he pushed hardest with 800 metres to go. Great Britain have won another four medals at the final day of the IPC Swimming Championships in Glasgow. That is all your sport, Clive. Now, the incredible moment when an Australian professional surfer was attacked by a shark on live television during an event in South Africa. Mick Fanning was competing in a World Surf League competition injeffreys Bay when the shark came at him from behind. He managed to shield himself with his surfboard and then, in his own words, punched the shark in the back. It swam off, leaving Mick Fanning unhurt, but the rest of the day’s action was cancelled. just before we go, let’s take a quick look at some of the main stories coming up this week. As we’ve been reporting, tomorrow the Prime Minister will make a ",,
63,BBC1 London,20-jul-2015,BBC News at One,13:00,30 mins,True,"David Cameron sets out a five-year strategy to tackle home-grown Islamist extremism. Speaking of Britons who have joined so-called IS and those tempted to join, Mr Cameron said it was a ""tragic truth"" that they don’t identify with Britain. Any strategy to defeat extremism must confront head-on the extreme ideology which underpins it, take its component parts to pieces. We’ll be asking what the government can do to stop young people becoming radicalised. Also this lunchtime. The murder of 79-year-old Don Lock after a road accident. A man appears in court charged with his stabbing. Fifa’s outgoing President aims to put his house in order before he leaves. The doors are open again but the queues are long. Greek banks let customers in after a three-week close. And caught on camera. The terrifying moment an Australian surfer is attacked by a shark. On BBC London, the green buses powered by diesel, battery problems mean they are more polluting than promised and tributes for a 5 -year-old girl crushed by a tree in an east London park. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. The ""struggle of our generation"" - that’s how the Prime Minister has characterised the fight against Islamist extremism. Speaking this lunchtime to an audience in Birmingham, he said there’s been a ""failure of integration"" in the country and he pointed out that many convicted terrorists were first influenced by non-violent extremism. Mr Cameron also criticised anti-semitic conspiracy theories. Our Political Correspondent Iain Watson reports. This man became a suicide bomber. He’s one of more than 700 people who travel to the Middle East since IS ceased territory in Syria and Iraq including these sisters from Bradford were thought to have taken their children with them. It estimated as many as half of those who went to Syria have returned, potentially posing a threat to this country. Today the Prime Minister set out a five-year strategy to tackle extremism. We have to confront a tragic truth that there are people born and raised in this country who don’t really identify with Britain and who feel little or no attachment to other people here. Indeed there is a danger in some of our communities that you can go your whole life and have little to do with people from other faiths and backgrounds so when groups like Isil rally young people to their poisonous cause, it can offer them a sense of belonging that they can lack here at home. At the core of the prime ministers strategy, a review led by Louise Casey, civil servant whose work of families and tackle social behaviour. She will try to make people who are a danger of being radicalised a part of society. Betterjob opportunities society. Better job opportunities for women, society. Betterjob opportunities forwomen, language society. Betterjob opportunities for women, language skills. Today’s speech by the Prime Minister was more about changing attitudes than changing laws. Parliament will debate counterterrorism measures in the autumn but the Home Secretary was stressing that tackling Islamist extremism is simply part of a much wider strategy. What we’re doing is the government later this year is setting out a wider counter extremism strategy which will introduce some legislation which will also be about working positively with communities. The words the prime ministers speech where welcomed by the foundation set UP where welcomed by the foundation set up to counter Islamist extremist in this country but they now want to see action. We also in my belief need somebody accountable to the PM who coordinates all of the various departments on this agenda and each have their own internal strategy to deal with and make sure they are singing from the same hymn sheet which requires coordination from Downing Street. So much for the home front for that today MPs will ask the Defence Secretary wider were not told British military personnel had taken part in air strikes without Parliamentary approval. So where there is cost party agreement on the need to tackle radicalisation, it’s how to do it at home and abroad which often proves controversial. With me now is our Home Affairs Correspondent Daniel Sandford. We have been here before. The government is talking tough about terror. What’s new this time to mark the Prime Minister is still speaking some are not sure exactly he so far, but we are in a situation where we have been before with the Prime Minister standing up and saying now we need to get serious about this issue. You may remember when Tony Blair said after the 7th ofjuly attacks on London, the rules of the game are changing. But what is different this time is that the Prime Minister started his speech by talking about dealing with the ideology. Previously there was a lot of focus on legislation, on what is the right legislation we need to deal with people who are conducting small-scale warfare against us in the Internet age. Whereas today was all about ideology. About the fact that young people seem to be finding themselves in a position where they are more easily persuaded by jihadists in Syria than by their people around them, their teachers, and by their politicians around them and I think that is the thing which is slowly dawning on the politicians that, actually, this is a battle of ideas and it is a battle which, in a small section of the Trinity, they are losing and they need everyone to come on board and try and help them to try to stop them losing any more ground. OK, Daniel, many thanks. The Fifa president, Sepp Blatter, is to set out his plans for reforming world football’s governing body which was plunged into crisis when seven of its officials were arrested in a US corruption investigation. The proposals include publishing salaries, introducing ""integrity checks"" and setting a term limit for presidents. Mr Blatter has announced he’s stepping down, but still hasn’t set out exactly when. The election will be held on the 26th of February next year. Our correspondent Richard Conway sent this report from Zurich. Sepp Blatter it seems has a little over seven months to try and cement those reforms he is so keen to introduce before he hands over power for that we’ve been waiting all morning in zero to find out exactly what those plans will be, how he will prevent them, and of course when he will want to start that transitional process. Now we know it will be February next year and at that point, Fifa will hopefully start looking to its future. Fifa officials arriving in Zurich today know they must act fast and decisively. The US criminal investigation into alleged widescale bribery and corruption involving football officials is ongoing. They are now attempting to salvage Fifa’s long-term future. Sepp Blatter announced last month that he would step down as president in light of this latest scandal. But before he departs, he claims he wants to change Fifa. In particular, he wants to introduce a centralised integrity test to vet new executives. He believes Fifa’s congress of 209 member nations should elect a powerful committee members known as Exco. Crucially, he is advocating a maximum term limit of 12 years for top officials and he wants football fans to know how much they are paid. This is not a Sepp Blatter problem. This is a cultural problem within Fifa. No question, Sepp Blatter is a key part of the problem, no question. You can’t change culture with the same leadership. He’s got to go. The key issue here is proper root and branch reorganisation as opposed to who’s going to in a popularity contest and sit at the top of the tree. Whoever comes next will inherit an organisation scarred by scandal. One man who may want the formidable job is the former French international Michel Platini, who now runs the European game. I understand the majority of world football leaders back him to take over, but he still to make a final decision. The 26th of the breed 2016 is the date we now know for the Fifa presidential election. -- date we now know for the Fifa presidential election. -- 26th of February. They will come back to zero and come back to rubber-stamp the reforms that we will find it a little bit more about in the next few hours when Sepp Blatter speaks to the mediocre but for Michel Platini it’s an opportunity now to try and decide if he wants this job and then to try to persuade those member associations he is the right man to reform Fifa and lead it out of the crisis it’s found itself in. Richard, many thanks. Banks in Greece have reopened after a three-week shutdown. There are still restrictions in place and prices are going up because of increases in VAT. It cost to Greece billions of euros. Our correspondence sent this report. After three weeks of limbo, the banks are finally reopened and with them the safety deposit boxes where many here store their cash. The European Central Bank pumped emergency liquidity into the Greek banking system allowing them to reopen because of the austerity measures that the Greek government passed here last week. But there are still restrictions in place. So for example a weekly withdrawal limit of A20 euros. You can’t open any new account or cash any checks for example but they are still functioning and the authorities here hope that might restore a sense of normality here in Greece. They queued from early morning, a rush to access the banks as the doors opened. Among the crowd, frustration at what the past three weeks have brought. Businesses having been unable to pay suppliers, pensioners having queued up at cashpoints in the boiling sun. I want to tell Tsipras and his predecessors to drown themselves for the nightmare they created. I owe rent, the prime minister can pay it for TTIE. We are hungry. How should I feel? I feel as if I’m without money. What can I do? The banking crisis may be easing but the first new austerity measures are biting. Today, VAT in restaurants, on transport and other goods rises from 13% to 23%, a concern for Greece’s service industry. We have a problem with the customers because everybody is scared about the extra money they have to pay. So we think that Greeks every year will be less and less. That’s important for small business, small restaurants, family businesses, destroyed. Many of them will be closed. The closure of the banks is thought to have cost the economy around 3 billion euros. Making it necessary to have even harsher austerity measures to address the balance so in the coming weeks there will be a rise in corporate tax, a push for more privatisation and labour reforms including Sunday trading. The chaos of the past three weeks may have eased very slightly, but Greece is very far from being out of the woods. A 3lI-year-old man has appeared in court charged with stabbing a retired lawyer to death after a minor road accident in West Sussex. Don Lock, who was 79, died after the attack near Findon last Thursday. Matthew Daley, from Worthing, was remanded in custody and will appear at Crown Court tomorrow. Let’s speak to our correspondent Daniela Relph who’s in Crawley. This was a short hearing, three minutes long. Matthew Daley appeared in the dock wearing a grey sweatshirt, bluejeans and in the dock wearing a grey sweatshirt, blue jeans and was sweatshirt, bluejeans and was in handcuffs. He spokejust sweatshirt, bluejeans and was in handcuffs. He spoke just three times during the hearing to confirm his name, his date of birth, he is 31+ years old, and his address in Worthing in West Sussex. He faced two charges, one of murder of Don Lock and a second charge of the possession of a bladed article, the knife that was used in relation to that murder charge. He didn’t enter a plea today and he will appear in Crown Court again tomorrow. That will be just for a bail hearing. Now, watching all of this from the public gallery of course, at Crawley Magistrates’ public gallery of course, at Crawley Magistrates’ Court was Don Lock’s a family, his grandson, his grandson 's girlfriend looked across at Matthew Daley as he spoke in the hearing and they wanted to be here today for these initial proceedings. They left the court here with their family liaison officers and other police officers without making any comment. But Andrew Locke spoke about his father being the perfect role model, thanking the public for their overwhelming support in recent days following the death of Don Lock in that alleged road rage incident in Findon last Thursday. Thank you very much. At least 27 people have been killed and 100 injured in a bomb attack in the south-eastern Turkish town of Suruc. It’s close to the Syrian city of Kobani, the scene of fierce battles between Kurdish forces and fighters from Islamic State. Militants have carried out a number of suicide bomb attacks at or near border crossings in the past. One of Britain’s most successful Paralympians has described wheelchair services for many disabled people in England as being in ""chaos."" Baroness Tanni Grey Thompson says thousands of disabled people are waiting more than a year for the right chair. NHS England has admitted it doesn’t know how many people in the country use wheelchairs, or how much it spends on them. Our correspondent Nicki Fox reports. For 12-year-old Penny, her wheelchair enables For12-year-old Penny, her wheelchair enables her to be independent and do all the things her friends do. But it’s not always been this way because she’s not always have the right chair. Her family lost confidence in their local NHS wheelchair services after being told they would have to wait more than a year for a suitable chair. At one point, she was given this. I could not move, could not reach the wheels and an adult had to help me and that kind of ruined any friendships I wanted or had. But her experience is not unique. The process of getting a wheelchair on the NHS is failing on every level. According to one of Great Britain ‘s most successful Paralympic and is. With some waiting up to seven years to get the right chair. For many disabled people in England, the provision of wheelchairs, it’s just chaotic and we know that if people aren’t getting the right chair it’s causing harm. It costs the NHS over £1 billion a year for that we can’t tinker around the edges with this and need to make sure we do something dramatic so people get the right wheelchairs. Those who work in wheelchair services say the lack of national guidelines and funding means there’s a need for reform. We have been asking for change for more than years. We know the situation is not acceptable because every locality commissions differently and you always going to get this postcode lottery. NHS England acknowledges the need for change. It is setting up a national database because it doesn’t know how many wheelchair users there are or how much it spent on equipment because the figures are held locally. Today campaigners took two wheelbarrows to launch their charter backed by the NHS. It will urge services across England to ensure more people get the right chair when they need it. Our top story this lunchtime... David Cameron sets out a five-year strategy to tackle home-grown Islamist extremism. He says there is been a failure in the country. On the hunt for ET, Professor Stephen Hawking launches the biggest search yet for other life in the universe. Later on BBC London, we speak to a builder whose one-man protest against airport expansion brought traffic at Heathrow to a halt. The primary school playwright getting ready for opening night at the Royal Court Theatre. That is in 15 minutes. Is there other life out there? It’s a question millions of us have asked over the years. Well, Professor Stephen Hawking says that now is the time to find out. Supporting the launch of the biggest effort to date to search for extra-terrestrial intelligence, he said the ten-year effort will listen for broadcast signals from a million of the stars closest to Earth. Our Science Correspondent, Pallab Ghosh, reports. The sky is littered with stars. We know around most of them are planets, some of them capable of supporting life, possibly intelligent supporting life, possibly intelligent life. Maybe even a world like our own. Astronomers in the US have been scanning the skies for radio signals from advanced civilisations for hundreds of years. Now there is a new, more ambitious, plan involving Professor Stephen Hawking. Speaking at a news conference at the Royal Society in London he said it was now time to begin seriously searching for other signs of life from other worlds. Somewhere in the Kosmos, perhaps, intelligent life may be watching these lights of hours, aware of what they mean. Or do our lives wander in life with Kosmos? Universe discovered its existence on one rock. There is no bigger question. It is time to commit to searching for life beyond Earth. Those behind the initiative sale be the biggest scientific search ever undertaken for signs of intelligent life beyond Earth. They plan to cover ten times more sky than previous programmes and span five times more of the radio Spectrum 100 times faster. For decades, Manatee has speculated about the possibility of making contact with alien civilisations. -- mankind. If we did get a signal from another world, what should we do? An interesting question would be, do we communicate? Do we answer? We do not want to engage ourselves in answering that question. We believe it is really a subject of big debate to be had. Many scientists believe there is only a small chance of receiving a signal from aliens from outer space. If we do, we will know that humanity is not alone in the universe. The number of people in the UK whose organs are donated after death has fallen for the first time in more than a decade. Figures show that transplants also fell by 5% last year compared with the previous 12 months, due to a lack of suitable donors. Our Health Correspondent, Dominic Hughes, reports. Donating a vital organ - a heart, kidney or liver - can save a life. The number of donors has fallen, reducing the chances that a vital match with someone in need can be made. Anyone at any time can need an organ. If we were all on the liver transplant list, not just liver, kidneys, heart, all the organs transplant list, we would always be insuring each other. Unfortunately, someone has to pass away every minute of the day. Each body has the potential to have nine organs donated to nine other different people. The number of donors saving lives like Daniel’s is in decline. Last year, those donating after death fell by 3% to around 1300, the first fall for 11 years. Living donations, people who give a spare kidney part of their kidney while they are still alive, were down by 5%. There was a fall in the overall number of people receiving a donated organ, also down by 5%. The reasons for the decline, fewer people are dying in circumstances which means organs are suitable for transplant. A greater proportion of families are refusing permission for organs to be taken. One thing we know, which is really hard is making that decision on behalf of someone else, if you did not know what they wanted. We are calling on everyone to have the conversation so the family would know if it ever happened to them. New technology could help. This device keeps organs warm and bathed in nutrients, rather than storing them on ice and could increase the number of organs available for transplant. From December, Wales will be the first part of the UK to assume everyone is an organ donor unless they opt out. Dominic Hughes, BBC News. Labour’s Acting Leader Harriet Harman is facing a revolt after ordering Labour MPs to abstain in a vote about the Government’s Welfare Bill. Many are expected to defy her, and three of the party’s leadership contenders have criticised her. The bill includes plans to limit child tax credits to two children. Let’s speak to our Assistant Political Editor, Norman Smith. Labour seem in disarray over this? ~ I think we all thought Labour’s election result was a disaster for them. Actually we seen -- election result was a disaster for them. Actually we seen -- things seem to be getting even worse. They are facing a rebellion on government plans to curb benefits. This after Harriet Harman told MPs she wanted then to abstain on the Government welfare bill, which includes plans like cutting child tax credits and capping benefits. She said we need to stop opposing everything the Government does. A lot of her MPs, I am told scores of them, are deeply unhappy about this. They believe these changes will drive more people into poverty. This is a split which runs from top to bottom of the party, right up into the Shadow Cabinet. A leadership -- party, right up into the Shadow Cabinet. A leadership -- leadership contenders seem to be going off into allsorts of different directions. jeremy Corbyn says he will rebel. Yvette Cooper says she will remain loyal to Harriet Harman. Andy Burnham has remained silent about what he will do. We have reached a stage where Ed Miliband, for all his difficulties, at least led a united party and you know where he stood. Now we do not know where the party stands on welfare and it seems to be split from top to bottom.

The mother of a professional Australian surfer, who was attacked by a shark, has spoken of the ""terrifying"" moment she watched the incident unfold live on TV. Mick Fanning was competing in South Africa when the shark attacked, as our correspondent, james Longman, now tells us. A surfer waits for his next wave. And then this... Look again to the right. That is the grey fin of a shark bursting out of the water. The surfer is unaware what is happening. Ifelt like I wasjust about to start moving and get going, just start paddling again. All of a sudden, I don’t know, Ijust had an instinct that someone was behind me. All of a sudden, I started getting pulled under water. Then the thing came up and I was on my board and it was like, right there. I saw the whole thing just thrashing around. I was getting dragged under by my leg rope. Ifelt like it had kicked me off but it was still there, attached to my board. Ifelt like I punched it a couple of times. It is not over, he still has to get away. Thankfully, rescuers were there moments later. It was all caught on live TV at the World Surfing League final in South Africa. The lucky man? Three times world surfing champion cannot believe what has just happened. It kept coming at my board. I was kicking and streaming. Wow! Did you see some teeth? Did you get some teeth? Ijust saw fins. I was waiting for teeth to come at me while I was swimming. I was just like, ""Agh!"" Did you get a couple of punches in? I punched it in the back. I cannot believe it. Back on dry land, the 31+-year-old is taking it in his stride. I am somehow perfectly fine. And, an important message. just so you know, we’ve spoken to your mum. Cool! This is absolutely terrifying. I got up and walked across to the television. I could not believe what I was seeing. I thought we had lost him. Mick Fanning is already a surfing legend. Now he will always be the guy who says he punched a shark on live TV and lived to tell the tale. james Longman, BBC News Time for the weather. Here’s Chris Fawkes. Ple nty of Plenty of whether to sink your teeth into. You can see the extent of the live rain and drizzle. A nightmare for those with frizzy hair! We have also had extensive cloud cover. By and large a lot of cloud to take us through the rest of the afternoon. There could be a few moments that brighten up, particularly across parts of Northern Ireland but maybe towards Wales and the south-west of England later on in the day. In the middle and we could start to see the cloud breaking up as well. There is a chance to see a few brighter spells later on, across Cornwall and western parts of Devon. A humid feel in the southern counties of England. Eventually it will reach northern England later on this evening. It will feel sticky. For northern Ireland, some brighter spells. There is the risk of some heavy, potentially thundery, showers. In Scotland, some extensive cloud an outbreaks of rain. Rain there or thereabouts, perhaps turning try later on in the day. It will be a particularly warm and humid start to the evening across East Anglia and the south-east of England. Temperature is still around 20 degrees. Eventually the temperatures will drop away. One or two forecasts across the North of Ireland. For most of us, a mild night. What about the rest of the week? We have an area of low pressure just to the north of Scotland. It will be there for the rest of the week. The wind will come from quite a long way north, past Iceland. It will not be the warmest spell of summer weather. Tuesday looks like this. Close to the area of low pressure, plenty of showers in Scotland. One or two showers moving into England and Wales and into the Midlands. The best of any bright sunny spells in the east.

He calls it the ""struggle of our generation."" Speaking to Britons who’ve joined so-called IS and those tempted to join, Mr Cameron issued this blunt warning. If you are a boy, they will brainwash you, strap bombs to your body and blow you up. If you are a girl, they will enslave and abuse you. We’ll be asking whether today’s plans stand any more chance of being successful than previous government measures. Also tonight: Ti’1âI’â YOU QD, More trouble at FIFA - a protest aimed at Sepp Blatter who confirms he won’t stand for the presidency again. after an accident on a swing. And a mother’s terror as she watches her surfer son being attacked by a shark live on TV. Absolutely terrifying. I actually got up and walked across to the television because Ijust On BBC London: And, powered by batteries - so why are hundreds of eco-friendly ""Boris buses"" running on diesel? And the young father killed in a punching game - a man goes on trial accused of manslaughter. Good evening. The ""struggle of our generation."" That’s how the Prime Minister described the fight against Islamist extremism in the UK. Speaking to an audience in Birmingham, David Cameron said some British-born Muslims had little attachment to British society and he spelt out in stark terms the fate that awaited young men and women if they left the country to join self-styled Islamic State. He also outlined new measures to combat radicalisation, including giving parents powers to confiscate their children’s passports and looking at ways of tackling extremism in prisons and online. Here’s our Home Editor Mark Easton. The message ITIESSBQE WGS Muslims delivered to a largely Muslim audience in a predominantly Muslim Birmingham school. Characteristics are now as British as queueing... David Cameron believes the two longer has been looked and is to counter bogus theories to hear Rack Attack allies in young men and women. He made a direct appeal to anyone tempted by the extremists. He will not be some valued member of a movement, you are cannon fodderfor them. They valued member of a movement, you are cannon fodder for them. They will use you. If you are a boy they will use you, struck bombs to your body and blow you up. If you are a girl, they will enslave and abuse you. That is the sick and brutal reality of Isis. After the murder of 30 British tourists in Tunisia, the Prime Minister promised a full response to the threat from so-called Islamic state. With hundreds of attrition Muslims having already travelled to Syria to join term -- already travelled to Syria to join term -- IS, the response in encouraging moderation and promoting integration. But it is a strategy that comes with risks. He talked about enforcing British values, how can you be confident and forcing values about the role of women or the freedom of homosexuals, you won’t alienate the people you are hoping to integrate? Our values are so great, we should want to enforce them for all, including new arrivals, including people who are subject potentially to these practices. It is only if we do that we can claim to have a strong values that build a strong country. David Cameron spoke of the failures of integration, pointing to areas where people had little or no contact with those from different faiths and backgrounds. There are places in Birmingham where residents can live in a cultural bubble, places where extremism can be quietly incubated. But telling people they must conform to British weighs risks leading the resentment the government wants to neutralise. In a local restaurant, a group of young Muslims had mixed feelings about David Cameron’s speech. If it restricts civil liberties, he might draw people to the radicals. Ithink liberties, he might draw people to the radicals. I think the the radicals. Ithink the Prime Minister was right when he said there are progressive or moderate Muslim voices being drowned out by those claiming that there is land is right. There has been members of the community that are hiding things happening in their communities. They are afraid to speak out and this speech, David Cameron made it clear what is is Islam, what is ordinary Muslims and what is Islamic extremism and he made that distinction clearly. David Cameron knows it is controversial but he is convinced the way to defeat is Islamic extremism is worried less about cultural sensibilities and more about British values. The Defence Secretary has confirmed five British pilots have been embedded with US and Canadian coalition forces since last autumn, carrying out air strikes against so-called Islamic State in Syria. Michael Fallon told MPs none of the pilots was currently involved in active missions. The government has faced criticism for not consulting MPs, who voted against proposed military action in Syria two years ago. Some think the Defence Secretary today asked them to reconsider in the future. Our Political Correspondent Carole Walker has the story. A suicide on attack today killed and maimed dozens of young people in a Turkish town close to the Syrian border. Government officials blame Islamic State militants, a reminder that borders are no barrier to the extremists. Richest pilots have carried out more than 180 successful strikes on IS targets in Iraq. They don’t have Parliamentary approval to carry out similar attacks into Syria, but the Defence Secretary said he would like to get an agreement to do so in future. Tackling Isis only in Iraq is illogical when it doesn’t respect international borders. It’s command and control centre is in northern Syria. It is from Verte that its weapons and fighters flow into Iraq. But he confirmed five British pilots have already carried out attacks like these in Syria. They were authorised either Defence Secretary who said they were under Allied command but acting within British and international law. Some MPs on all sides are angry they had not been told. We were given a solemn promise that if British service people were to bomb in Syria, we would be consulted. If the government does seek to extend air strikes to take on IS fighters like these in Syria, it might not be easy to win the backing of MPs. We remain opposed to extending air strikes into Syria without a great deal more justification than has been outlined by the Minister. I cannot help but feel we are in danger of doing something just to be seen to be doing anything. The government’s opponents have warned the failure to come clean until now about the actions of those embedded pilots, has undermined trust in ministers. It may make it harder for the government to win any future parliamentary vote. Many thanks. The embattled head of Fifa, Sepp Blatter, has ruled out standing again as a candidate in next year’s election to be president of football’s world governing body. At a news conference in Zurich, Mr Blatter outlined reforms to the organisation - including publishing salaries and setting term limits for executives. He’s stepping down after senior officials were arrested for alleged corruption. Mr Blatter’s press conference had its fair share of drama when a British comedian rose from his seat and approached him. He then showered the FIFA President with fake dollar bills - before being removed by security guards. From Zurich, here’s our Sports Editor Dan Roan. Backin Back in May, senior Fifa officials turned up here ahead of the presidential election and several of them were arrested and thrown into Swiss jails. Today, a surprise raid of a different kind, but one nonetheless, which served to underline how much rancour, controversy and ill feeling surrounds wilful all’s governing body, on this, a crucial day for its future. The last time set latter spoke publicly here, he announced he was standing down. Today was no less dramatic. We are starting a press conference. Where is my security. A British comedian managed to infiltrate the press conference and showering the Fifa president with fake banknotes in a protest against football’s beleaguered world governing body. When he was escorted out, a visibly shaken Mr Blatter composed himself and then confirmed he will be stepping down in February. I will not be a candidate for the election in 2016. I have put mY for the election in 2016. I have put my mandate at disposal and there will be a new election for a new president. I insisted on that. It is not only for that, I cannot be the new president because I am an old resident. The shock arrests almost two months ago plunged Fifa into crisis. Amid American and Swiss criminal investigations into allegations of corruption, Mr Blatter resigned four days after being re-elected. Today he announced a new task force to bring in reforms, central integrity checks for executive committee members, term limits for officials, including Presidents and disclosure of salaries of Fifa members. With this, we are on the right track, Fifa. With improved governance and greater accountability. But that hasn’t satisfied those who want a body from outside Fifa to lead reforms. We shouldn’t be surprised from the meaningless waffle we have heard. It is what we predict it, they have been fiddling around on the fringes. But there isn’t a genuine reform we need. They have appointed, or they intend to appoint some sort of independent person to oversee the process, but it will be answerable to them, appointed by them or the confederations, said the degree of independence will not be there. The race to become the next president will begin. Michel Platini is the favourite. Replacing Mr Blatter is one thing, but restoring Fifa’s credibility could be problematic. A man’s appeared in court charged with the murder of retired lawyer in West Sussex. Great-grandfather Donald Lock, who was 79, was stabbed to death following a minor road accident on Thursday.

She often had three jobs at a time. She was a single parent, and just looked after her boys the best she could. Sylvia has now raised thousands of pounds for the mill workers’ families. I want to help them as much as what I can. So many families who have been been hurt. One unidentified body was recovered late last night. As time goes on, firefighters say they fear the worst. We have been on site for four days, and I think realistically we are looking at moving into a search and recovery phase, but we are still hopeful of potentially finding life as well. Firefighters say they won’t leave here until everyone is found. It has emerged the owners of this mill will warn two years ago about the dangers of explosions. The council said the company listened and the site was made safe will stop police have also confirmed an investigation to give people answers about how this explosion started is now finally underway.

Wheelchair services for many disabled people in England are in chaos - according to one of Britain’s most successful Pa ralympia ns. Baroness Tanni-Grey Thompson says thousands of people are waiting more than a year for the right chair. NHS England admits the system needs to change. It’s setting up a national database because it doesn’t know how many people in the country use wheelchairs, or how much it spends on them. Our Disability News correspondent Nikki Fox reports. A game of football with friends would normally be in possible for these boys who all have severe disabilities. But it isn’t, thanks to these souped-up, speedy chairs. For disabled people, the wheelchair doesn’t just get you from A to B. The right wheelchair enables you to get the life you want. Having the right chair means a lot. You have to feel comfortable and relaxed with it. I can get out and about and I can have trust in my wheelchair. There is evidence that thousands are waiting more than a year to get the right chair. In some extreme cases, those with life limiting conditions have died before their chair arrived. For many disabled people in England, the provision of wheelchairs is just chaotic. We know that if people aren’t getting the right chair, it is causing harm. We need to make sure that we do something dramatic and make sure that disabled people get the right wheelchairs. How do you go about getting a chair on the NHS? Firstly, you’ll get a referral to your local wheelchair services. From your GP, for example, you’ll then be assessed to determine your physical and social needs. Finally, a decision will be made on whether there is a need for a chair. It seems like a simple system. But campaigners say it is failing on every level. Because of a lack of funding and port commissioning. 12-year-old Penny’s family lost confidence in their local wheelchair service after being told they would have to wait more than a year for a suitable chair. At one point, she was given this. I could not move. I couldn’t reach the wheels. An adult always had to be there to help me. That ruined any friendships that I wanted or had. Now, she can play with her friends and be more independent, thanks to this chair donated by a charity. Those who work in wheelchair services, say the lack of national guidelines and funding is a means the service is in need of reform. We have been asking for change for more than 20 years. We know the situation isn’t acceptable. Because every locality commissions different, then you are always going to get this postcode lottery. NHS England acknowledges the need for change. For the first time, it will collate data on a national level to improve services. Today, campaigners took to wheelbarrows to launch an NHS backed charter which aims to ensure that people get the right wheelchair when they need it. Police are investigating the death of a five-year-old girl, after an accident on a swing in East London. Officers believe the girl was hurt when a tree the swing was attached to collapsed in Mile End Park on Friday. Helena Lee reports. Like many children, Alexia was enjoying a warm july afternoon at this playground with her family. But these blue tents, a sad reminder of how it turned to tragedy. Little Alexia, just five years old, she was with friends, her mother was watching on. She went on one of the swings, then, somehow, its wooden frame collapsed. This is part of what is left of the Sweden frame. Questions now turn to how this could have happened. For Alexia’s grieving mother, she says more checks should have been done to make it safe. It is tough. Really tough. During the day, you have friends and family sitting, keeping you company so it keeps you strong. At night, when we go to sleep, you just look at a place and it’s void. You go into the bathroom, you see her toothbrush, toothpaste. You know. The adventure playground here has been closed. An investigation is being carried out by the Met Police and the Health and Safety Executive. While that goes on, the family left devastated. Among the floral tributes and cards here one that simply reads, ""words can’t explain."" People in Greece have been going into banks to withdraw money and pay their bills for the first time in three weeks. The banks were closed to stop a run on deposit accounts - amid uncertainty that Greece would remain in the Eurozone. But the stock market remains shut, banks won’t make new loans and customers can’t use their deposits to repay their loans early. Good news for some drivers - the price of diesel has fallen below that of petrol at some supermarkets for the first time in more than a decade. Morrisons was the first to cut the price of diesel by up to 2p per litre. Tesco, Asda, and Sainsbury’s followed the move with their own price cuts. The mother of a professional Australian surfer who was attacked by a shark has described how she watched the incident live at home on TV. Mick Fanning was competing in South Africa when the shark went for him. He managed to escape by thumping it on the back. His terrified mother Elizabeth saw the whole thing happen in her living room in Sydney. Sangita Myska reports. It was like a scene from the Hollywood movie, jaws. A surfer, seeking a thrill gets the shock of his life. Slowed down, Mick Fanning’s tussle with a shark is even more terrifying. After its fin slices through the water Fanning desperately clings to his board only to have it knocked away. For a funeral heart stopping seconds, he disappears out of sight. Fanning finally re-emerges, this time furiously swimming for his life. Miraculously, the 31-year-old was pulled out of the water completely uninjured. The video clip of his survival has gone viral with over 2 million downloads. Once on board a rescue boat, Fanning spoke to a reporter. Ijustjumped away and he kept coming at my board and I was kicking and screaming. It was off the South African coast cheering the final of thej league surfing championship. Mick Fanning’s extraordinary encounter took place. The entire incident was broadcast live around the world. Watching at home in Australia was his mum. It was absolutely terrifying. I actually got up and walked across to the television because I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. I thought we had lost him. Somehow, I’m perfectly fine. Somehow, indeed. With feet back on dry land it was relief all round. The competition was temporarily suspended. Organisers said it was the first time a surfer had ever been attacked while taking part. The Open Golf Championship in St Andrews has reached an exciting and long-awaited climax. Let’sjoin Karthi Gnanasegaram, who’s there for us now. 22-year-old Paul Dunn struggled at the start. By the second hole, he was so far off course, he had to play from the new course. As he struggled, Zachjohnson steered his way to the top. Challenging was former Masters champion Adam Scott. He has come close at the open before. At the age of 21 jordan Spieth has already made his mark in the first two majors of the year. He wants to make it a hat-trick at the home of golf. With the leaders chopping and changing, the pressure played on the mind. Charging up the leaderboard came Australian Marc Leishman. And former champion Louis Oosthuizen. With the trio tied at the top after 18 holes, preparations began for a play-off. It wasn’t to be Paul Dunn’s day. jordan Spieth’s dreams of a grand slam have gone. They are still playing behind me in a play-off. Zachjohnson, Marc Leishman, Louis Oosthuizen. We have gone into an extra day and into an extra evening. They have four holes left to play. A hidden network of tunnels built underneath the White Cliffs of Dover during the Second World War has opened to the public today. The Fan Bay Deep Shelter was carved out of chalk in just a hundred days to help guard Britain’s coastline. But when it fell into disuse, its entrances were sealed. We’ve sent Duncan Kennedy underground to take a look. Duncan. You join us live 100 feet deep inside the white cliffs of Dover. Built as you said on the direct orders of Winston Churchill who was afraid that Britain’s coastal defences simply weren’t ready in 1940. He ordered this to be built in secret. Take a look at these shots from outside. You are zooming in on the only hole you can see from the surface. Into this incredible subterranean world that the rest of the world had no idea that eight existed. In 100 days they burrowed through the chalk and showed it up with metalwork. But look how dangerous it could have been. That is what happens when the chalk comes tumbling down with no bracing. john Barker is from the National Trust. You were one of the first in here after 50 years left on touch. What was it like to step back in time? It was amazing to find this expensive system of tunnels. We found lots of artefacts is, a needle and thread, books and a telegram. We found lots of graffiti, some sensitive and some saucy. Nearly 200 officers were based inside here. Everything was left the way they left it. A lot of their tools were found here. There was also a hospital, and officers mess, and accommodation for all of the troops who live down here in temperatures of about 12 degrees. One of them was Warrant Officer George Duggan and his sonjohnjoins as with a picture of his dad. What was it like for your dad to live down here like a mole? Pretty rough. Condensation, cold, smoky. Pretty tough, I imagine. But there you go. He was down here from 1939 to 1945. He never really talked about it much. Little bits and pieces now and again. Thank you very much indeed. The National Trust have spent two years restoring it to make it safe for the public. years restoring it to make it safe forthe public. It for the public. It was open to the public today and what a treat they are going to get walking back into the history of the Second World War. Thanks very much, Duncan. Time for a look at the weather. Here’sjay Wynne It was a muddy day beneath all of this cloud. This cloud is now bringing some rain. Behind it, there will be some showers. Once the showers have cleared away from the far south-east, we should see fresh air filtering far south-east, we should see fresh airfiltering in. Still quite warm, though. Humidity should be that bit slower. A bit of a mixed bag tomorrow. Some places will have a very pleasant day with sunshine. However, there will be clouds around and thick enough to deliver a fuchsia hours. The best of the conditions are to be found in the south-east. Mainly dry. Similar temperatures towards the south-east but much dry and brighter skies. To the Midlands a bit more cloud. A fuchsia hours dotted around. My sun-dried mainly for the rush hour. Across western Scotland, quite cloudy with frequent showers. Hence it should improve with the showers becoming fewer and further in between. Any places will have a pretty reasonable day with good spells of sunshine. It could stay dry all day in the far south-east. Still quite warm in the south-east corner. 25 also in London at the humidity that bit lower. In the latter part of the week, quite a bit of cloud around. Then the temperatures start to drop away. 14 degrees in Glasgow by Thursday. By the end of the week the top temperature anywhere in the UK no higher probably than 20 degrees.

They’re part of the Mayor’s flagship transport project, and the hybrid electric diesel buses are meant to be the most environmentally friendly bus of their type. Now BBC London has learnt that many of the new Routemasters are in fact running on diesel. They are certainly distinctive. No known as new Routemasters. They are meant to be powered by a a hybrid electrical and diesel system. I quite liked them because you can get on the back as well. Where is the other ones, you couldn’t. They look good. At the moment there are 500 in London, but will be another 300 next year. The total cost will be just under £300 million. Backin under £300 million. Back in March, Transport for London admitted it had a problem with the batteries on these buses. Now the drivers are saying the problem has not been resolved.

In all, 200 will have faulty batteries replaced on the warranty. I get complaints about it being too hot on the top deck, and other power systems are not working. These are always the cleanest and greenest buses. Even on diesel? Yes, we have more of these than anywhere else in the countries so we are doing well with these.

Now BBC London has learnt that many of the new Routemasters are in fact running on diesel. They are certainly distinctive. No known as new Routemasters. They are meant to be powered by a a hybrid electrical and diesel system. I quite liked them because you can get on the back as well. Where is the other ones, you couldn’t. They look good. At the moment there are 500 in London, but will be another 300 next year. The total cost will be just under £300 million. Backin under £300 million. Back in March, Transport for London admitted it had a problem with the batteries on these buses. Now the drivers are saying the problem has not been resolved. This is meant to be the most environmentally friendly bus of its type. But if the hybrid system is not working, it rains in some cases they are running on diesel. -- it means. Ten out of ten of these buses do not have the electric motor is working. The diesel motor is not strong enough... Critics say problems with the batteries mean drivers are finding that buses difficult to drive. When the battery is not working, the buzz is slow to respond. People allow the bus to get out and then get angry that it does not pull out. One driver told me he could only get UP One driver told me he could only get up the road at 60 mph. This path is the -- up the road at 60 mph. This path is the -- this bus has had problems. The prototype broke down on the first day. Passengers complained about the stifling heat. They are excessively priced, sometimes as much as £70,000 more than the bus they have replaced. And this eat less people. -- than the bus they have replaced. And this eat less people. -- they seat less people. But the problem is the batteries are not strong enough to fulfil the whole duty for the day. This photo shows the removed batteries sitting in a bus depot. TfL admits there are 80 of these buses now operating onjust diesel generators. In all, 200 will have faulty batteries replaced on the warranty. I get complaints about it being too hot on the top deck, and other power systems are not working. These are always the cleanest and greenest buses. Even on diesel? Yes, we have more of these than anywhere else in the countries so we are doing well with these. From time to time the science will have to be adapted, but we are working very hard at low -- have to be adapted, but we are working very hard at low -- no cost to London. This most logical of transport projects remains extremely contentious. -- contentious. -- this most political project. We hear from the families still not backin We hear from the families still not back in their homes in Canvey Island after the floods. Ajury’s heard how a father of two from south east London was killed during a ""macho game"" where the players took turns to punch each other. 23-year-old Tommy Main from Erith collapsed after being hit in the chest during a 16th birthday party last summer. Our home affairs correspondent Nick Beake was in court. Tommy Main when to this party one evening injune last year. The court was told thatjust evening injune last year. The court was told that just after midnight he became involved in what was described as this match show game in which he exchanged part-- described as this match show game in which he exchanged part -- punches with another man. Today the jury heard from the woman who was hosting the party. She said the pair were laughing and joking, engaged the party. She said the pair were laughing andjoking, engaged in laughing and joking, engaged in what she described as man banter. They were talking about the gym and muscles. She said it was the victim who threw the first punch, at which the defendant laughed and said, have another shot, which he did, but then it was the defendant’s turn and it was said he threw a punch at the chest and shoulder area of Tommy Main. He was said to remark at that point, that was a good one. Moments later, he fell forward and went into cardiac arrest. Somebody tried to administer CPR but it was to no avail. Paramedics were called but he died in hospital short time later. We understand the jury was red estate went from the defendant. -- was read a statement. He was said to be crying and very emotional, and said ""I was play fighting with Tom in the dining room, and exchanging jabs, just messing about."" ""He just stood there, took a breath, laughed and fainted onto the floor. "" the jury was also told a postmortem had found the cause of death to be cardiac arrest after a blow to the chest, and that cocaine and alcohol were found in Tommy Main’s system. The prosecution says no one suggests that the defendant intended to kill or seriously injure Tommy Main, but nonetheless he does find himself faced with manslaughter because it was said that his punch was a significant cause of the death. He denies manslaughter and this is expected to last two weeks. People who carry knives are to be targeted by the Met Police as part of a crackdown on the growing problem in the capital. Officers are planning weapon sweeps and high visibility patrols, and will also be visiting the homes of known offenders. Under new rules, re-offenders will be sent to prison for four years. Lambert has the highest rate in the country of people living with HIV. -- Lambeth. St Thomas ‘s hospital is to become the first hospital in the UK to screen all A&E patients for HIV during routine blood tests unless nations opt out. Three years ago Christian felt so ill he told us back to consult A&E. Doctors said he had flu and sent him home. Eventually I got diagnosed with HIV. Had there been universal testing available I would have reduced the number of hospital visits and also, you know, the distress that being ill has caused me. Most hospitals require you to opt in for an HIV test. But patients at St Thomas ‘s will now have to opt out. Around half the people here on have their blood is taken. They are routinely tested for things like liver and kids a function. -- kidney function. But from now on, they will also be tested automatically for HIV. In the capital is -- automatically for HIV. In the capital is -- it is estimated one in 140 people has HIV. But in Lambeth that soars to one in 68. Across the country nearly a quarter of those living with HIV do not know they have it. If you are died and is late, you are ten times more like you to die in the first year after diagnosis. -- if you are diagnosed late. And you have been more at risk from passing it on. Your treatment could also be costly, so clinicians are saying in the long run this could save the NHS money. We have skilful councillors who support people post diagnosis. It is important to get people in quickly so they are getting the right information, but it is much worse to live with HIV and not know the infection is there. Kristian is among those who say automatic testing should be rolled out elsewhere, so those with HIV can manage their condition and look to the future. A builder from West London whose one-man protest brought traffic to a halt at Heathrow has told a court he acted to defend his area from airport expansion. Neil Keveren pleaded guilty to obstruction at Uxbridge Magistrates after admitting blocking a road with his van. Our reporter Gareth Furby has been speaking to the Harmondsworth resident about what he did. Outside Uxbridge Magistrates’ Court, supporters of a builder called Neil Keveren, who believes he had no choice but to break the law, to fight the prospect of a third runway at Heathrow. We have to get our voice heard. We have a promise, no third runway, by David Cameron, and we have to draw a line. No third runway! This is what he did onjuly two. He used his van to broke -- This is what he did onjuly two. He used his van to broke -- block the road tunnel to terminals two and three. The route was closed for about 20 minutes. Neil Keveren says a new runway will destroy the community of Harmondsworth village. About 54 paces from my front door, everything that we gets destroyed. 750 homes. Everything this way gets to live on the boundary fence over the Slashdot airport. Also supporting him today, the Labour MP who believes lawbreaking is justified if it is the only way to fight the plans. Women would not have the vote if it wasn’t for the suffragettes. Surely that aims a local MP is saying it is fair enough, go ahead? We were given a fairenough, go ahead? We were given a certain promise by the Prime Minister that no third runway would be built. People voted for him on that basis, and he has a trade the whole community. Mr Keveren admitted causing obstruction. He was fined £600. The prosecution said such disruption had huge repercussions for the travelling public. The court heard the trafficjams were so bad that police had to abandon their vehicles to get to him. But he left court today unrepentant, after saying if the Government betrays his community they will have to look after each other. More now on the death of five-year-old Alexia Walenkaki who was crushed after a rope swing she was playing on collapsed. Tonight an investigation by the police and Health and Safety Executive is underway. Our reporter has spent the day in mile end. You have been so beating to Routemaster’s family. -- You have been so beating to Routemaster’s family. -- speaking. -- Alexia’s family. You can see what a popular and familiar face Alexia was at the playground. This tribute says"" you are my best friend in the whole wide world. When I fell over, you always pick me up. uPÂ up. "" on Friday Alexia came to celebrate her sixth birthday. Before it was time to go home, she begged her mum for one more shot on a favourite ride. One of the posts snapped, falling on Alexia and she was left lying on the ground. Despite the efforts of Arimidex she died later of hospital -- in hospital. -- paramedics. Her mother is asking serious questions about the safety of the playground. This should not happen at all. The post broke, and looking at the loch itself you could tell but it was rotten. -- block. What is going through my mind is like, you kind of wish you couldn’t come to the park with her, but parks are supposed to be safe for children to play. Which is why I took her here every day. Obviously there is an investigation. We don’t know what the conclusion will be, but I get the sense you feel this was a death that maybe could have been avoided. Surely. If the play equipment was checked properly, I am sure that it wouldn’t have happened. It should have been much stronger. How are you coping without Alexia? It has only been a couple of days, hasn’t it? It has been tough. During the day you have friends and family visiting and keeping you company so it keeps you strong, at night when we go to sleep, you just look at the place and it is void. You go into the bathroom and see her toothbrush, toothpaste... Now the focus will be on whether this could be avoided. Yes. Alexia’s mother handed us some footage given to her by parents at the scene, showing the post that clearly snapped. It appears to show the wood was rotten. We ca n not rotten. We cannot verify that, but the condition of that post will be the centre of a joint investigation by the Met police and the Health and Safety Executive. Many parents in this community and indeed many parents across London now will be worried about the safety of the children, when they come to do what all children should do, play.

A year ago today hundreds of homes and businesses were hit by flash flooding on Canvey Island. A million cubic metres of water fell in what was described as the worst storm in 300 years. Many people are still not back in their homes. Gareth George spent the morning with one family on Canvey Island. Christopher and his mother Patricia reliving last year’s flood. Christopher, who has autism, still hasn’t been able to go home. He is still in temporary accommodation, and we think he won’t be going back to his home until September. This wall, now protects Canvey from the sea, but the layout still makes it vulnerable in exceptionally heavy rain. The island itself is at or below sea level, and very flat. When it rains it is a bit like a teacup, it can just fill up. Blocked drains made the flood was, on the island’s pumps overheated. At the County Council says the lessons of 2014 have been learned. The works we have undertaken, and the amount of money that is going to be spent and has been spent, it will certainly not have that serious effect like it did injuly 2014. Since then, Canvey’s Underground draining system has been mapped, and hundreds of faults fixed. But some worrying damage has been discovered. A huge amount of faults were other companies havejust A huge amount of faults were other companies have just ploughed through pipe works, not even bothering to notice.

The team are here because they travel to the US tomorrow. And it is a large team, 115 great British athletes here to not Mike getting that send off. Stars of stage and screen are here to wish them good luck, giving them messages of support. They have also been demonstrating some of the sports that will be on show in Los Angeles. Many people will not be familiar with the Special Olympics. It starts on Saturday, there will be 6500 athletes from 165 countries, and our squad consists of 115 athletes competing across 19 different sports. I am joined by the actor Colin Salmon. And one of our dressage riders. Do you think this will have a transformative effect like the Paralympics? I hope so. As you can see here this is a very serious warm up. People are dancing and having so much fun, that they are going to Los Angeles very relaxed. Georgina, you have been competing since you are four. It is notjust about since you are four. It is not just about winning It is notjust about winning medals though. How has Riding helped you? It is about being part of a team, the social life is good. Also it is about having a good laugh and trying your best of the same time. The organisers think about half a million of-- people will watch some part of the games. How will you cope taking part in front of such large crowds? Hopefully it will be more than that, but I think the more it is working lives the more people will recognise learning difficulties as well. Colin, you have met many members of the team. What is the message? They know they are going out to perform and have fun and really be brave and bold. On a more serious note, if these people were engaged in all sports with everybody you would see a different level of engagement on a seriousness, but most importantly theyjust love it. It is heartening. Good luck, Georgina. 1984 was the last time Los Angeles staged an event like this, that was the Olympics. I am sure there will be many golden moments for these athletes. We wish them well, good luck to them. Now, when you go to a performance at the Royal Court Theatre in Sloane Square you perhaps might not expect time travelling ninjas and the ice cream that never melts. But that’s what happens when a group of 8 to 11-year-olds write for you. They’ve developed their own plays to tour London schools. And their production is now in residence at the Royal Court. Here’s our arts correspondent, Brenda Emmanus. The creativity of young minds interpreted by professional actors. A selection of short plays by aspiring writers aged eight to 11.

It is going to bring us some rain, we have had heavier bursts across the North West. It is all clear by tomorrow morning. The temperatures though will stay in double figures, but it should be a much more comfortable night’s sleep.

BBC London has learnt that many batteries on the new hybrid Routemaster buses are faulty, which means the vehicles are running on diesel alone.

67,BBC News 24,20-jul-2015,BBC News at Ten,22:00,30 mins,True,"David Cameron’s strategy for tackling what he calls the ‘poison’ of Islamist extremism. Among the measures he outlined was allowing parents to get their children’s passport cancelled if they feared they’d been radicalised. Our new Our DEW 3ppI’08Ciâ1 the extremist from everybody else, so that all our Muslim communities can be free from the poison of Islamist extremism. And he blamed the failures of integration for the hundreds of Britons who travel to Iraq and Syria, a message which divided opinion on the streets of Birmingham. There are progressive and moderate Muslim voices that are being drowned out by those that are claiming that there is line is right. If it restricts civil liberties it may your people over to the other side. We’ll have more reaction to the Prime Minister’s strategy - he called it ‘the struggle of our generation’. Also tonight... More trouble at Fifa. A protest aimed at Sepp Blatter who confirms he is not standing for the presidency again. A key vote in Parliament right now on the government’s welfare bill with the likelihood of a Labour split. Trump in trouble on the campaign trail as the billionaire Republican is accused of insulting American veterans. And, after a play-off at the Open, American Zach johnson wins at St Andrews - his second major title. Coming up in sports day, recovery from a huge crash to finish Day 16 of the Tour de France. Chris room retains the overall lead. Good evening. David Cameron has set out a 5 year strategy to defeat what he calls the ‘poison’ of Islamist extremism in Britain. He said some British-born Muslims had ‘little attachment’ to British society, and blamed the ‘failures of integration’ for making hundreds of UK citizens join Islamic State militants. Our Home Editor, Mark Easton, has the story. The message was aimed at British Muslims, delivered to a largely Muslim audience in a predominantly Muslim Birmingham school. David Cameron believes for too long there has been reluctance to confront the arguments and bogus conspiracy theories used to radicalise young men and women. He made a direct appeal to anyone tempted by the cultish glamour of the extremists. You won’t be a valued member of a movement. You are cannon fodder for them. They will use you. If you are a boy, they will brainwash you. Strap bombs to your body and blow you up. If you are a girl, they will enslave and abuse you. That is the sick and brutal reality of Isil. After the murder of 30 British tourists in Tunisia last month, the Prime Minister promised a full spectrum response to the threat from so-called Islamic State. With hundreds of British Muslims already having travelled to Syria to join IS, the strategy is based on challenging extremism, countering radicalisation, encouraging moderation, and promoting integration. But it is a strategy that comes with risks. You talked about enforcing British values. How can you be confident that enforcing values about the role of women, or the freedom of homosexuals, you won’t actually alienate the very people you are hoping to integrate? Our values are so great that we should want to enforce them for all, including new arrivals and people who are subject, potentially, to these practices. It is only if we do that that we can really claim to have the strong values that build a strong country. David Cameron spoke of the failures of integration, pointing to areas where people have little or no contact with those from different faiths or backgrounds. There are places here in Birmingham where residents can live in a cultural bubble. Places where extremism can be quietly incubated. But telling people they must conform to British ways risks feeding the very resentment the government wants to neutralise. In a local Balti restaurant, a group of young Muslims had mixed feelings about David Cameron’s speech. If it restricts civil liberties, I think you may draw other people to the other side more. People may turn towards the radicals. I think the Prime Minister was right when he said that there are progressive and moderate Muslim voices that are being drowned out by those that are claiming that their Islam is right. That has been members of the Muslim community that are hiding things happening in Muslim communities. They are afraid to speak out. I think David Cameron made clear what is and what are ordinary Muslims. He made that distinction very clearly. David Cameron knows its controversial, but he has become convinced of the way to defeat extremism is to worry less about cultural sensitivities and more about British values. The defence secretary Michael Fallon has rejected claims that MPs were kept in the dark about the involvement of British pilots in airstrikes against Islamic State targeted in Syria. He said that 5 British pilots have been embedded with coalition forces carrying out attacks in Syria in the past year. Islamic State militants have been blamed for the deaths of 30 people today in a bomb attack in a Turkish town near the Syrian border. Our Political Correspondent, Carole Walker, reports. A suicide bomb attack today killed and maimed dozens of young people in the Turkish town of Suruc, close to the Syrian border. Government officials blamed Islamic State militants, a grim reminder that borders are no barrier to the extremists. British pilots have carried out more than 180 successful strikes on IS targets in Iraq. They do not have parliamentary approval to carry out similar attacks into Syria, that is something the Defence Secretary said he would like to get agreement to do so in future. Tackling Isil, Mr Speaker, only in Iraq is illogical when Isil itself does not respect international borders. It’s command and control centre is in northern Syria. It is from there that its weapons and fighters flow into Iraq. But he confirmed that five British pilots, embedded with allied forces, have already carried out attacks like these into Syria. They were authorised by the Defence Secretary who said they were under allied command, but acting within British and international law. Some MPs on all sides were angry they had not been told. We were given a solemn promise that if British service people were to bomb in Syria, that we would be consulted. And if the government does seek to extend air strikes to take on IS fighters like these in Syria, it may not be easy to win the backing of MPs. We remain firmly opposed to extending their strikes into Syria, without a great deal more justification than has been outlined by the Minister. I can’t help but feel that we are in danger of doing something just to be seen to be doing anything. Labour has said it will consider any proposal to see British planes like these sent into Syria, but will seek assurances on the objectives and the legal basis. Some of the strongest criticism of the government has been on its failure to tell Parliament about what those pilots have been doing. Critics are warning that it is failure to do so that will damage trust and make it harder for the government to win a parliamentary vote that could take place this autumn. Sepp Blatter, the president of Fifa, football’s world governing body has confirmed that he’s stepping down and that his successor will be elected next February. Mr Blatter decided to retire following the arrest of senior FIFA officials for alleged corruption. The start of Mr Blatter’s news conference was delayed after it was disrupted by a British comedian. Our Sports Editor, Dan Roan, reports. The last time Sepp Blatter spoke publicly here, he stunned the world of football by announcing he was standing down. Today was no less dramatic. This is starting... We are starting a press conference. British comedian Lee Nelson, real name Simon Brodkin, managing to infiltrate the press conference and showering the Fifa President with fake banknotes in a protest against football’s beleaguered world governing body. Once the prankster was escorted out, a visibly shaken Blatter took a few moments to compose himself, before returning to confirm that his reign would finally end in February. I will not be a candidate for the election in 2016. I have put my money at their disposal and now there will be new elections for a new president. I insisted on that. It is not only for president, but a new president. I cannot be the new president because I am an old president. The arrests of senior football officials here almost two months ago plunged Fifa into crisis. Amid American and Swiss criminal investigations into allegations of systematic corruption, Blatter resigned just four days after being re-elected. But clung to power in a bid to oversee Fifa’s recovery. Today he announced a new task force to bring in reforms, central integrity checks for executive committee members. Term limits for officials, including presidents. And disclosure of salaries of Fifa members. With this we are on the right track. We have improved the governance and greater accountability. Today was all about Fifa trying to regain control, and with a period of anticipated upheaval. But these measures would satisfy many, who feel the governing body lost the right to decide how to repair its reputation a long time ago. What do you make of what we have heard from Sepp Blatter today? We should not be suprised. What we heard was what we predicted. They have been playing around with the fringes, but at the end of the day there isn’t a genuine reform that we need. They have appointed or have been intending to appoint an independent person to oversee a process, but it will be answerable to them, appointed by them or the confederations. The degree of independence is not going to be there. The race to become the next President will now begin in earnest, Uefa’s Michel Platini the favourite. But replacing Blatter is one thing. Restoring Fifa’s battered credibility could prove a much tougher challenge. Voting is taking place in the House of Commons on the government’s welfare reform bill, which includes £12 billion of new welfare cuts to be implemented over next five years. Some of the measures being proposed include limiting child tax credit to two children, and reducing the welfare cap to £20,000 to households outside London. But the decision on how to vote tonight has divided the Labour Party. The party’s acting leader, Harriet Harman, had suggested that Labour would not oppose the bill. But many of her colleagues disagreed and after an internal debate Labour MPs were asked to back an amendment, but to abstain in the main vote. There’s a sharp focus on how the four contenders for the Labour leadership are voting tonight. Our Political Correspondent, Vicki Young, is at Westminster. What is your reading of things tonight? This isn’tjust about welfare. This is about George Osborne and the Conservatives try to frame the political debate for the next five years. Osborne is trying to plant the Conservatives flag where he thinks the centre ground of British politics is. It has exposed deep divisions within the Labour Party. There are some on one side who agree with Harriet Harman that the party can’tjust oppose welfare changes for the sake of it, they have to listen to those who didn’t vote for them at the general election. Elsewhere, you have those led byjeremy Corbyn. They say the welfare changes will cause more children to be brought into poverty and will be penalised those at the lower end of the income scale. Tonight, there is an uneasy compromise. Most Labour MPs will certainly add staying on this bill. They are very happy about it. Lots of them are saying they are papering over the cracks. When a new leader is in place, this issue could come back to cause more issues for the Labour Party. A brief look at some of the day’s other other news stories... A man’s appeared in court charged with the murder of a 79-year-old in West Sussex. Donald Lock, a retired lawyer, was stabbed to death following a minor road accident on Thursday. Matthew Daley, who is 34 and from Worthing, was remanded in custody by Crawley Magistrates. He’ll appear at Lewes Crown Court tomorrow. Rescuers searching the remains of a wood mill in Cheshire, which was destroyed by an explosion on Friday, have said they’re now carrying out B I’âCOVâI’y OpâI’8lioI’I. Although they’ve insisted they are still holding out hope that they may find someone alive. Last night a body was recovered from the factory. Three people are still missing. Police are investigating the death of five-year-old Alexia Walenkaki in a zip-wire accident in East London. It happened in a play area at Mile End Park on Friday. Officers believe she suffered serious injuries when a tree the wire was attached to collapsed. The Health and Safety Executive is also investigating. In Greece, ministers say they’re hoping the economy will start to pick up again fter banks re-opened today for the first time in 3 weeks. It follows last week’s decision by MPs to accept the terms of another bailout. But banks won’t make new loans and prices are going up because of increases in VAT. Our correspondent Mark Lowen reports from Athens. This is 21st-century Greece, where they queued today outside banks closed for three weeks, desperate to regain a sense of normal life. But even as the shutters came up, capital controls stayed in place. Withdrawal limits, a ban on new accounts, and on cashing cheques. The frustration of those waiting is still clear. I want to tell Alexis Tsipras and his predecessors to go and drown themselves for this nightmare they are creating. I owe rent. The Prime Minister can pay it for me. This is all the money I can take out now. We are hungry. But as the banking crisis eases, new austerities bites. They changed the VAT rate on receipts today from 13% to 23%. Restaurants, transport and other goods were all hit by the hike. It is very serious for the business of restaurants. It is something that for the last two years we have tried to fight. Tourists go to Turkey, or they go to Spain, and they have VAT about 6%. It is much better. Some restaurants say they will cover the tax rise, worried that if not it is their customers who will be cut. You will feel the tax hike with the change of prices. The old Greek kebab has gone from £1.lIo to £1.55. The iced coffee, good in this heat, has risen from £1.10 to £1.25. Transport too has been affected. The minimum fare for an Athens cab ride has gone from £2.20 to £2.lIo. It has hit high tourism season, Greece’s biggest money earner. Business numbers are already down here due to Eurojitters. The sales tax would help. This picturesque country craves stability. The recent chaos may have eased a touch, but Greece faces a daunting road ahead. In Afghanistan, a US air strike killed up to 10 Afghan soldiers at an army checkpoint this morning in an area south of Kabul where the Taliban are active. It’s one of the deadliest episodes of what’s called ‘friendly fire’ in recent years. It’s over 6 months since British troops left Helmand province in southern Afghanistan, where Afghan forces are struggling to cope as our correspondent, David Loyn, reports. This 13-year-old can strip down ago in seconds, reassemble it and shoot. He and his brother, who is 14, are on the front line in Helmand. Defending a police post which is often under Taliban attack.

The main towns are secure, with poppy growing pushed out to the Badlands outside the zone where most people live. Roads are far better than they were.

In the United States, the former Republican presidential candidate john McCain has called on the billionaire Donald Trump to apologise to the families of veterans for comments he made about servicemen captured in war. Mr Trump, who’s in the race to become the Republican presidential nominee next year, said Mr McCain was not a war hero because he was taken prisoner in Vietnam. Our North America Editor, jon Sopel, has the latest. Quiet, modest, and understated - words that have never been attached to the billionaire property mogul and reality TV star Donald Trump. And nor will the word underfunded, now that he is having a tilt for the Republican nomination. But few would have imagined his comments would be this outspoken. In his sights this weekend, former Republican presidential candidate Senator john McCain. He is not a war hero. He is a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured, OK? McCain spent more than five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, and was tortured when he was there. These latest comments from Trump have finally brought condemnation from the other Republican hopefuls. When you go after an American hero like that, likejohn McCain or anyone else who has served, particularly under those circumstances as a prisoner of war, that is just wrong. Donald Trump owes every American veteran, and in particular john McCain, an apology. But arguably, at this typically flamboyant launch for his presidential bid, he was even more offensive about Mexicans, calling them rapists and criminals. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they are bringing those problems with us. Drugs, they are bringing crime, they are rapists, and some I assume are good people. But his comments have brought boycotts at this soon-to-open Trump Hotel. The celebrity Hispanic chef who is due to open the major restaurant here said he wants nothing more to do with the project. Other bigger contracts have been lost as well. But among Republican voters, since focusing on immigration, Donald Trump’s poll numbers have gone up and up. The Republican leadership might have hoped he would burn bright but quickly burn out. That hasn’t happened. And the man who isn’t playing by any of the normal rules of engagement is, for the moment, leading the Republican field. Who said this race would be dull? The Cuban flag has been raised over Havana’s embassy in Washington for the first time in 54 years. The US Secretary of State, john Kerry, welcomed the restoration of diplomatic ties between the two countries, saying it was futile to live in the past. But he cautioned that the road to full relations remained long. The price of diesel has fallen below the price of petrol at some supermarkets for the first time in more than one decade. Morrisons was the first to cut the price I to peep early to. This was followed by Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury’s. Computer hackers have stolen millions of items of customer data from an online adultery website called Ashley Madison. The hackers, calling themselves The Impact Team, threatened to expose personal details unless the service was shut down. Ashley Madison has 37 million users worldwide, more than a million of whom live in the UK. Our Technology Correspondent, Rory Cellan-jones, has the story. Have you ever found yourself on a really bad blind date? It has 37 million users, has been around for 14 years, and is even talking about floating on the London stock market. But Ashley Madison, with its slogan, ""Life is Short, Have an Affair"", is a controversial site holding very sensitive data. Now it has been hacked by an organisation calling itself the Impact Team, and there is a threat that all those who use it to cheat on their partners will see their details published online. The site had made big claims about its security. But experts aren’t convinced. Well, I think we’re finding out some things this afternoon that suggest that security maybe wasn’t their top priority. There is some evidence coming to light that even simple tricks allow you to find out whether a certain person has an account or not. So, you know, in retrospect it is no surprise at all. In a statement, the Canadian firm behind Ashley Madison said: But, despite the company’s claims that the leaked data has now been removed, some of it is still out there. We found a document that is still online with the Impact Team, and gives some details about the data it claims to have that. There are names, addresses, and some very personal information about two male users of Ashley Madison. One of whom is said to have paid recently to have his profile deleted from the side. And there is a warning to the company, ""if you profit off the pain of others, whatever it takes, we will completely own you."" The company has promised to delete user profiles for free. The hackers have called it immoral for charging for this service. Ashley Madison is among a long list of organisations to have had their security breached by hackers recently. But few have been the guardians of quite such sensitive and embarrassing data.

Significant concerns remain over the ability of the police force at the centre of the Rotherham child abuse scandal to keep children safe. The police watchdog found a quarter of cases were handled inadequately by the South Yorkshire force. It’s not a thing of the pastjust because we have had media intention, perpetrators aren’t going to think I am going to stop abusing children now because it’s on the news. They’re going to find different ways of getting away with it. We’ll be asking what more the force needs to do to protect children properly.

Later on BBC London News: The Mayor’s deputy claims the Home Secretary was wrong to overrule the use of water cannon in the capital. Mexico calls for tighter regulations. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at one. The police force at the centre of the Rotherham child sex scandal has been told it still needs to make major improvements to some of its procedures. The police watchdog said that although there had been tangible signs of progress since an initial report last September, since then of 28 child protection cases handled by the South Yorkshire force, only two were assessed as good. A report last September raised serious concerns about the force’s approach to child protection. Danny Savage reports. Rotherham, a town tainted by a legacy of child abuse. It’s almost a year since the full horrific scale of what was going on here was laid bare and according to one woman, who was a victim of abuse as a child in the town, it is still going on. It is not a thing of the past. just because we have had media attention, perpetrators aren’t going to think, ""I’m going to stop abusing children now because it’s on the news."" They’re going to find different ways of getting away with it. So yeah, it is still happening and I would love to sit here and say one day we can stop it permanently, but I think it is about being realistic. It is about bringing it to a minimum. And that alarming snapshot is backed up by a review out today from Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary. They strongly criticise South Yorkshire Police’s approach to child protection in a report last September. Today, the results of a follow-up inspection have been published. It says major improvements are still needed here to protect vulnerable children. They are not good statistics. They are not what I’m sure the public would expect. They’re not what the leadership of the force would expect and they’re certainly not what we would expect. And further improvements need to be made and we’ve made that very clear. So what does the force say as they find themselves in the spotlight yet again for failing children? Do you feel that South Yorkshire Police needs to apologise to people for the situation as it stands at the moment? I am incredibly sorry that victims have been let down previously. I want to make sure that doesn’t happen again and so I and my staff are absolutely committed to making sure that doesn’t happen and that we do actually learn from the mistakes that have been laid bare. There is no hiding place for anyone. We’ve got an independent investigation in relation to our past failings. We need to make sure they don’t happen again. South Yorkshire Police do point to improvements which have been made and the inspectors stress the situation is not irretrievable. There are more investigators working on cases and police point to a number of arrests over abuse in Rotherham, but a lot more needs to be done and South Yorkshire Police acknowledge that’s the case. With me is our social affairs correspondent Alison Holt. What are the force still getting wrong? They really haven’t, it seems, got their head around the detail of how they need to record and question in these cases. We need to be clear there’s been some improvement. For instance, control room staff have been looking at whether a child is at risk when calls come in and putting that information into how the call is handled. Then they hold a review of what’s going on to make sure they haven’t missed anything. But across the force there still seem to be many same things coming up. For instance, the wrong questions being asked. Children who are vulnerable and at risk being judged for the way they’ve behaved, they found in police records one I5-year-old girl who was vulnerable being described as a naughty child. Rather than anyone looking behind that to find out what might be going on in her life. Paperwork not being kept up to date. And if you don’t have that paperwork you can’t build up a pattern of what’s going on. Why this matters so much is because exploiters and abusers and traffickers are very good at what they do. They’re extremely professional about it. Therefore, the people who are tackling them need to be as good. They need to be better, in fact, need to be as good. They need to be better, infact, one better, in fact, one step ahead. Briefly, why is it taking them so long to change? I think many would say that this is about changing a culture. We have seen the scale of what has gone wrong in South Yorkshire over the last two decades. More than 11+00 children exploited over a period of 16 years. But I do think it’s fair to say that very few forces would stand up to this level of scrutiny. This is an area where we are still learning and it’s not just South Yorkshire, it’s many authorities, notjust the police, who need to get this area right. Thank you. The Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, Stephen Timms, has accused some Labour MPs of undermining the party. Last night, 1+8 Labour MPs voted against the Government’s plans to cut the welfare budget- despite being told not to by the party’s acting leader, Harriet Harman. One of those MPs, the leadership contenderjeremy Corbyn, says it’s Labour’sjob to stand up for the poorest in society. Here’s our political correspondent, Ross Hawkins. THE SPEAKER: Division, clearthe lobby. Watch what happened when the Commons voted on welfare. Labour told its MPs to abstain to stay where they were. 1+8 ignored that order, got up and voted against the Bill. The morning after, the party split. Those 1+8 rebels unrepentant. I think it is clear from the fact that we were not supporting, whether we voted against or whether people abstained. We are not supporting the vast majority of what is in that Welfare Bill and most people will support us in our view on that. Some won’t. One Shadow Minister said new MPs had rebelled like her were undermining Labour’s work. I think it is important that all of us work together. I think party unity is important and I think that will be the view right across the party when we return from the recess in September. The row began here on television over a week ago when Labour’s leader, Harriet Harman, said this about voters. They didn’t trust us on the economy and on benefits and we have to listen to that and respond to that and that’s why we are not going to be voting against the Welfare Bill. We will not be opposing the household benefit cap. Many in Labour disagreed with those pledges. She tabled an amendment trying to see off the row, but failed. Now, Labour’s talking up the welfare amendment it does want to see, but it backs limited child tax credits to two children. And that’s because Harriet Harman wanted to avoid being accused by the Chancellor of unthinking the opposing every saving that he tried to make. Instead she ignited a huge internal row. One of the leadership candidates, jeremy Corbyn, voted against the Bill and others abstained. Come September one of them will be in charge of this Labour Party. Thatjobjust got a bit harder. Government departments have been finding out the scale of the cuts they’re going to have to make over the next five years. The Chancellor, George Osborne, says they’ll have to find savings of £20 billion a year over the course of the next five years. I’m joined by our economics correspondent, Andy Verity. Run us through the details. We won’t know the exact details of where the axe falls until November when we get the outcome of the Spending Review. This is the launch of the review, what they’re effectively doing is giving the perimeters. Cuts of £20 billion, in other words, giving the perimeters. Cuts of £20 billion, in otherwords, by billion, in other words, by 2019-20 the overall budget for those Government departments will have to be £20 billion less. Of course they protected departments like the NHS, like schools, like overseas aid, and like defence. That means that the cuts will fall more deeply on the unprotected departments like local Government, for example, the Foreign Office, transport, and the institute forfiscal Office, transport, and the institute for fiscal studies estimated that the cut for those departments would need to be just 13% but actually what we are seeing here is that they’re proposing departments model for much deeper cuts. In one scenario, you are looking apt a cut of 25% in spending in real terms by 2019-20 and in another scenario they’re looking at a cut of 1+0%. Given what the IFS says they need to achieve, that’s a lot more than they need to achieve, but if you get the worst case scenario you at least know where to find the soft targets. Thank you. Let’s cross to Westminster and talk to Norman Smith, our assistant political editor. These are bigger cuts than expected? Yeah, I suspect when Government Ministers and civil servants in unprotected departments got this document from MrOsbourne they’re probably tempted to head to the drinks cabinet and pour a large and dangerous drink because achieving cuts of up to 1+0% is way beyond what any of them would be expected. Bear in mind they’ve already had to save billions over the past five years. They’ve done the easy savings. This is a huge ask now. MrOsbourne’s response is to say what about greater efficiencies? Greater use of digital technology what about devolving staff outside of London and selling off some land? The MoD apparently owns 1%. It’s still a massive ask. Independenting the Chancellor is actuallyjust trying to frighten the living daylights out of other Cabinet Ministers to say to them I want 1+0%, it’s a bit like if you try to buy a secondhappened car and the salesman says, oh, dear, that’s going to cost you £20,000. Then when you get it for £13,000 you suddenly think you have got a bargain, MrOsbourne is trying to put pressure on other ministers to come forward with radical bold savings which at the end of the day may not amount to 1+0%, but will still be huge, huge cuts. So, maybe there is cause for a drink but maybe not that big one. Thank you. A second body has been found at the site of a mill which was destroyed in a fire last week. Four people were said to be missing, presumed dead, after a series of explosions and fires at the wood flour mill at Bosley near Macclesfield. Students could graduate with debts of £53,000 under plans to replace maintenance grants with loans. The claim has been made by the Institute for Fiscal Studies which has been investigating the impact of the plans set out in the Budget. The IFS says many graduates will only earn enough to repay a quarter of their debt. The former publicist Max Clifford has appeared at Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London charged with one count of indecent assault. The 72-year-old is accused of committing the offence on a 17-year-old girl between 1981 and 1982. He denies the charge. Clifford became famous for brokering deals with the tabloids for kiss-and-tell stories. He will next appear at Southwark Crown Court in August. The head of the japanese electrical firm Toshiba has resigned after it was revealed that for years the company had been exaggerating its profits. The firm claimed to have made £780 million more than it had and top executives knew what was going on. Here’s our business correspondent Theo Leggett. A warning, this piece contains flashing images. A deep bow of contrition and the Chief Executive of one ofjapan’s most prestigious companies paid the price for a major financial scandal. TRANSLATION: The responsibility lies in the management including myself. As a response, I am stepping down from the post as the CEO and president. Toshiba is one ofjapan’s biggest companies. It is best known for its consumer electronics business, making things like televisions, camcorders and commuters for example. But it also makes industrial power systems, medical scanners, x-ray machines and nuclear reactors. It’s alleged that managers set unrealistic profit targets and turned a blind eye when employees distorted the figures to meet their demands. Trouble started with the financial crisis in 2008 which hurt Toshiba’s business. It got worse with the Fukushima disaster which virtually closed down the country’s nuclear industry. Analysts say the affair is a symptom of wider problems in japanese business culture. None of these guys benefitted from doing this at all. They needed to sustain the reputation which is tarnished and which really backfired. This isn’t the only scandal to hit corporate japan in recent years. In 2011 it emerged that optical equipment maker, Olympus, had hidden losses of more than £1 billion. Then as now, questions were raised about the way some japanese businesses operate and whether far-reaching reform is needed.

Well, Manchester’s Halle Orchestra has a solution. At a concert it’s giving in September, it’s asking the audience to pay at the end and only give what they think the performance was worth. Here’s our arts correspondent, Colin Paterson. Beethoven one of the classics the Halle Orchestra will be paying. The awedient won’t have to pay for their ticket until afterwards. Normally our ticket until afterwards. Normally our concerts cost between £15 and £30. This is to show people how exciting, it is. This is great music which they will really enjoy. We don’t mind if they don’t pay. We would love them to pay, but we want them to pay what they think it is worth. It is graduation day at the venue where the experiment will be taking place, but are the students tempted to come back for a concert which they could get for nothing? Have you been to classical concerts? No, I haven’t, but I’d love to go. What stopped you? It is not really mY What stopped you? It is not really my genre of music, but it is interesting, I have seen it on television and stuff and yeah something that I’d like to go to and get to know more about. How much do you think would be a fair amount to pay? Depending on the excitement, £30 to £50. It is a lot! Yeah, well I expect the talent to be quite high! The price isn’t the only change from the norm. Drinks can be brought into the auditorium and the audience will be encouraged to teet their reviews which will be shown on a giant screen. -- their reviews which will be shown on a giant screen. -- tweet.

It’s 90 years since Sir Malcolm Bell set a world land speed record of 150mph. Well, later today his grandson, Don Wales, will mark the occasion by taking to Pendine Sands in South Wales where the record was set and recreating the record drive using the same Bluebird car. Our Wales correspondent Hywel Griffith is there. Yes. This is what the fuss is about. The Sunbeam 350 that was Kristened Bluebird. This is the vehicle that created the legend. Later on this afternoon, they will be hoping to re-create the history on these sands biven by a descendant of Sir Malcolm Campbell. Driven by the spirit of the roaring 20s, Sir Malcolm Campbell’s Bluebird was effectively an aircraft on wheels built around a sea plane engine. The car claimed three land speed records reaching 150.76mph. 90 years on, it has been overtaken in the record books, but Bluebird has been handed down. My grandfather set his heart on being the fastest person and the first person to achieve 150mph. He was the first man to achieve that and for us to celebrate it 90 years later is a fantastic experience for me. The plan is to drive along the sands at a rather more leisurely 50mph. Giving spectators more thanjust a fleeting glimpse. Even now the car commands a crowd. Its story tells its history of 1920s post-war pioneering endeavour, but getting this thing back on the road, well that took its own bit of engineering. The carwas that took its own bit of engineering. The car was bout for a motor museum in the 1950s and restored in the 1960s only for it to be hampered by half a century of engine trouble. After a lengthy rebuild, now it is ready to ride again. It is a petrolhead’s dream. A special race car with a massive history, massive engine and all the power you could possibly need. The only restriction of this thing going faster is the technology of the tyres and the chassis. As as long as that engine keeps on roaring, today will see a little more history being made as Bluebird flies again along the coast of South Wales. I have spoken to people from across the country who have driven here just to see Bluebird riding for a few minutes this afternoon. So when the tide is out and the flag falls, they will be hoping to see history re-created here in South Wales. Hywel, thank you very much indeed.

Before the cricket, there is the usual pageantry to go through. Plans and routines are part of the game. She how Charlotte Edwards positioned herself. That gave the first wicket to Catherine Brunt. Her next would need no assistance. Australia 25-2. Now scathe Cross charged in. Momentum behind her. The Aussie skipper scuppered. Australia, the favourites, were now rebuilding. Perry approached that job meticulously measuring her drive to precision. Even she got her calculations wrong. Fortunately for her Groundy did too. Not easy, but nothing about this series will be. This is what it is about, runs and wickets, take hard work. Australia ground on in the West Country sun. Alex Blackwell made 50 and Perry glided there too. All frustrating for England, but then one of those moments which can change games. Knight’s accuracy ended Blackwell’s innings and no quarter was given. Violette Szabo is one of the great heroines of the Second World War. She was a British secret agent who worked in Occupied France until her capture and execution aged just 23. She was posthumously awarded the George Cross and the French Croix de Guerre and now they’re being auctioned in London by her daughter Tania. Here’s our correspondent, Nick Higham. Your identity card. Clothing, coupons. Ration cards and money. 60 in French francs. Sign here, please. If you want any more I can let you have some. I have never been so rich in my life! Virginia McKenna as Violette Szabo in Carve Her Name With Pride. Young, brave, beautiful. Though the real Violette apparently spoke with a Cockney accent. Her story may have grown in the telling but the outline isn’t disputed. She was 23, spoke fluent French because her mother was French and parachuted twice into France as an undercover agent. Her husband had been a French soldier of Hungarian descent who was killed. She left her two-year-old daughter behind in England. On her second trip she was captured, integrated and shot at a concentration camp. Now, the medals she was awarded after her death including this George Cross, are being auctioned by her daughter who has no children of her own. She hopes the sale will revive memories of her mother. By having an auction, once again, she is in the public eye which is where she needs to be because she inspires people and has inspired people and hopefully will continue to do so. Tanya says she never resented her mother’s decision to go to warment she says she understands her mother’s motives. She did it for her family which included me. She did it because she knew the history about relations between Germany and France and England and she grew up with that knowing it all and wanting to do her bit. In 191+8, Tanya received her mother’s George Cross from George VI, a moment captured in the film. It is for your mother. Take great care of it. Now she hopes her mother’s medals will find a British buyer who will cherish them and the memory of a remarkable woman. It is time for the weather. Hello. Most of us will enjoy a brighter day today. There is a glorious sunset in Essex. What glorious shot. On the satellite picture, you can see the extent of the clear skies across eastern areas of England. That’s where we will keep the best of the sunshine today. Across the zone of Northern Ireland, Wales, Northern England and Southern Scotland, we are going to be stuck underneath the area of thicker cloud. That cloud has been producing showers on and off all morning and will continue to do so. Most of the showers won’t be particularly heavy and they will be pushed through by the breeze. At least it is a brighter kind of prospect weather wise for most. The best of the sunshine today will be across southern counties of England and the South East too. Temperatures peaking in London at 25 Celsius and it is nowhere near as humid as it was yesterday. The showers across Wales, the Midlands and Northern England, this line of showers across Dumfries and Galloway will be slow moving because the winds aren’t pushing the showers along. There will be a few unlucky people in these areas who will see shower after shower after shower. The showers will clear away from Northern Ireland and the skies brightening up here and overnight, we keep the showers feeding in across Wales and the Midlands. Whereas the skies clear further north. It will be a chilly night. In rural parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland, we could see temperatures in the coldest spots getting down to three or four Celsius. Wednesday and Thursday, the weather chart is dominated by this area of low pressure. It is satjust to dominated by this area of low pressure. It is sat just to the north of Scotland. The wind is coming past Iceland and into the northern half of the United Kingdom. As you can imagine, it will not be particularly warm. Temperatures around two or three Celsius below the seasonal average for Wednesday and Thursday as well. Those winds will bring a few showers with them too. Particularly for the western side of Scotland. Those showers will turn heavy with the risk of thunderstorms developing later. Showers too for Northern Ireland and particularly for northern counties and England and Wales will have some showers and a lengthier spell of rain from this little feature running into eastern areas of England. Temperatures coming down a few degrees as well for East Anglia and the South East of England too. Now for Thursday, we will see a mixture of sunshine and showers. Most of the showers will be across Western Scotland. A few for Northern Ireland and England and Wales dry and bright with sunny spells, but there will be changes for Friday. OK, it is the same mix of sunshine and showers for Scotland and Northern Ireland, but for England and Wales, we could see a band of rain pushing up from the south, but there is a bit of uncertainty about how far north the rain band will get. It could stay in the English Channel on Friday, or it could push right the way across England and Wales, but either way, right the way across England and Wales, but eitherway, once Wales, but either way, once that is out of the way, as we head into the weekend, we will be back to a mixture of sunshine and showers. The weather for the weekend is not looking too bad. That’s how the weather is shaping up. Thank you, Chris.

And a warning that thousands of children won’t have a secondary school place in five years’ time. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. The Chancellor has called for radical change in Government departments to save £20 billion. Some departments will have their budgets protected but those that don’t are being asked to look at privatisation, selling off publicly owned land or contracting out services in order to cut costs. It’s all part of the Chancellor’s bid to get the Government’s finances back in the black. Our chief political correspondent Vicki Young is here. Vicki, fill us in on the details. The spending review in the autumn will be a clear statement of the Government’s priorities for the next few years. We know, of course, that they’re looking for significant savings - £20 billion pounds over four years. Some departments are being asked to come up with plans for cuts of 25% and 40%. Those levels would bring even bigger savings. Others have their funding protected including the NHS, schools, internationalaid, defence, and national security. The Chancellor says the target is tough, but achievable. Today we’re setting out the next part of our plan to eliminate the deficit and ensure our country lives within its means. We will invest in our key priorities, like the National Health Service and our national security. Elsewhere Government departments have to find significant savings through efficiencies, and by also giving people much greater control over their own lives and the lives of their communities. Which means cities like Manchester will have more say in how money is spent in theirarea. Mr osborne’s offering other places like Birmingham and Newcastle radical devolution of power. There is no proof this saves money, but the hope is that pushing decision making out of London will improve efficiency. More controversial will be a further tightening of the police budget. Back in 2012, thousands of officers took to the streets to protest against changes to their pay and conditions. Forces are braced for more and, across Whitehall, Government departments know they will have do more for less. It’ll be harder do stuff on pay, it’ll be harder to do additional efficiency savings. You’re probably looking at more fundamental change to the way that we do things. Is it impossible? I wouldn’t want to say that. Will it be hard? Yes, it will. The Chancellor does have his eye on £300 billion worth of public sector buildings and land, which he wants sold off for housing. Critics say he is flogging the family silver and squeezing spending too far. I think departments are already coming up with serious and bold savings. But some of this becomes completely unmanageable. Perhaps he is setting the bar high and he will appear to be the good guy if it is less when push comes to shove. Of course he is also making the point that he is trying to raise a substantial amount, tens of millions through asset sales. Now whether that can be achieved is another matter. He’s got to be, I think, a bit more honest about what he’s actually planning here, because he said in the Budget speech he was stepping off that roller-coaster ride, in public spending plans, and then he is telling his Cabinet colleagues to make deeper cuts than he was planning only a fortnight previously. So he has to make his mind up. What’s clear from today’s plan is that while ministers are keen to save money, they’re also seriously considering radical changes to the way the state spends your money. The Chancellor is urging ministers to be as radical as possible. Fiona. Surgeons in Manchester have performed the world’s first bionic eye implant to restore the vision of a patient with the most common cause of sight loss in the developed world. An 80-year-old man with age-related macular degeneration was fitted with the implant at Manchester Royal Eye Hospital. Our medical correspondent Fergus Walsh was given exclusive access to the operation. This is what the world looks like two Ray Flynn. His central site is gone and he relies entirely on his peripheral vision. gone and he relies entirely on his peripheralvision. He peripheral vision. He told me it severely limits what he can do.

Ray has dry age-related macular degeneration. It affect mainly the elderly and happens when cells in part of the retina become damaged. A few hours later, the surgical team at Manchester Royal Eye Hospital are ready to wrap this, the retinal implants, around the back of Ray’s right eye, a world first for his condition. Age-related macular degeneration is the most common cause of sight loss in the developed world. At least half a million people in the UK are affected. There is vast potential for any technology which could improve visual function and enhance quality of life. This is how it works. The patient wears special glasses which has a built-in video camera. The visual information is wirelessly transmitted to the retinal implants on the eye. Electrodes stimulate the retina’s remaining cells to send the visual signals to the brain to interpret. Two weeks after surgery, the key moment, as the bionic eye is switched on. Please close your eyes. Ray is asked to keep his eyes closed during the test so that the team can be sure that would be sure that would be he sees must come information from the camera on his glasses. Success. Horizontal.

South Yorkshire Police has been told it still needs to make major improvements to some of its child protection procedures. The force was severely criticised last year in an independent report which revealed that 1400 children had been sexually exploited in Rotherham over a 16 year period. Danny Savage is in Rotherham for us. Danny, this latest inspection found some improvement but that the police are still failing to recognise the risks to some children? That’s right. You could be forgiven over the last year for thinking that all this publicity surrounding child abuse in Rotherham, but a lot has been done to tackle it and it has all but been stamped out. That is not the case. More officers are working on cases and arrests have been made, but according to the report, a lot more still needs to be done. It’s nearly a year since the full horror of child abuse in Rotherham was laid bare. They were raped by multiple perpetrators. They were trafficked to other towns and cities in the north of England. They were abducted, beaten and intimidated. The area is now tainted by this legacy. 1,400 victims, over a 16-year period and, according to one of them today, it’s still happening. It’s not a thing of the past. You know, just because we’ve had media attention, perpetrators aren’t going to think - oh, well, I’m going to stop abusing children now because it’s on the news. They’re just going to find different ways of getting away with it. So, yeah, it is still happening. And that alarming assessment is backed up by a report today from Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary. Last September, they strongly criticised South Yorkshire Police’s approach to child protection. A follow-up review, published today, states major improvements are still needed. The job that South Yorkshire Police are doing at the moment is better than the job they were doing when we inspected them in 2014. But theirjob is to reduce and minimise risk against children, and they’re not doing that at the moment as well as they could or should be. That’s a very measured way of saying this force must do better. Do you feel that South Yorkshire Police needs to apologise to people for the situation as it stands at the moment? I’m incredibly sorry that victims have been let down previously and what I want to make sure is that that doesn’t happen again and so I and my staff are absolutely committed to making sure that doesn’t happen and that we do actually learn from these mistakes that have been laid bare. There’s no hiding place for anyone. South Yorkshire Police is improving and inspectors say there’s probably no police force that’s cracked child protection issues, but this area has a reputation and it needs addressing.

The action is part of a long-running protest against expected job cuts. The protesters ended their blockade at midday and services have since returned to normal.

A man has been charged with planning a terrorist attack on American military personnel in Britain. junead Khan, who’s 24, has also been charged with attempting to join so-called Islamic State in Syria, along with his uncle Shazib Khan. Our correspondent Daniel Sandford is outside Westminster Magistrates Court. Daniel, both men appeared there this afternoon? Yes, the two men had been in custody for seven days at Southwark police station before being charged this morning. They were brought to Westminster magistrates car in a dark blue armoured police van. They appeared in court in the grey tracksuit that almost become standard issue for terrorism suspects making their first appearance. Both men, 24-year-old junead Khan and his 22-year-old uncle Shazib Khan, are accused of planning tojoin uncle Shazib Khan, are accused of planning to join self-styled Islamic State in Syria. The most more serious charges againstjunead Khan alone, he is accused of running to attack American personnel in Britain. He is a driverfor a logistics company, the allegation is that he was going to use a vehicle to run down a US serviceman, possibly from one of the East Anglian ad bases, and then use a knife to kill him. That is a method of attack which has echoes of the murder of Lee Rigby to Magri years ago. Senior districtjudge Howard Riddle said both men should remain in custody before their first appearance at the Old Bailey in just under three weeks’ appearance at the Old Bailey in just under three weeks’ time. Thank you very much. The scale of the rebellion among Labour MP’s over yesterday’s vote on welfare cuts has brought out into the open deep division within the party, not least among the people vying to lead it into the next election. 48 Labour MPs defied the wishes of the current acting leader and voted against the cuts. Our political correspondent, Ben Wright, has been speaking to Labour MPs to discuss where they go from here. It was a thumping defeat. The party lost its leader and big names lost their seats. Across the country, devastated activists asked what went wrong and how should Labour change? But a division that was last night, as Labour MPs split, not only over the Government welfare bill but also where they stand as a party. 48 MPs defied their acting leader, Harriet Harman, and voted against the benefit kerb set out in the budget. Even new Labour MPs elected in May to different positions, sol Even new Labour MPs elected in May to different positions, so I here two here to here why. If Labour had a works canteen, this would be at, a memorabilia packed place where the party has dined for decades. Kat Smith was one of the 18 new Labour MPs to rebel. I was contacted by concerned constituents who were asking me to oppose it. The truth of the matter is we are the official opposition, and I was expected to act like the official opposition and oppose this bill. Trade union -- trade union leaders like Len McCluskey were furious with the decision not to oppose the welfare cuts, but Stephen Kinnock adds stained in the vote and said Labour needed to show it was listening to voters. We need to be a smart opposition, opposing where we need to oppose, not opposing, being constructive and demonstrating the statesman-like qualities which will take us back to power in 2020. Andy Burnham, the candidate seen as the party’s leadership favourite, also adds last night, but... Our position was not strong enough, as leader I would oppose this bill outrage. Only jeremy Corbyn voted against the plans out of the leadership candidates, putting the others on the back foot. People are confused about what Labour is standing for. We had to pull the party together and make sure we are challenging the Tories instead, that means much stronger opposition to these Tory plans and setting out a positive Labour alternative instead. How can Labour win Labour alternative instead. How can Labourwin again? Looming Labour alternative instead. How can Labour win again? Looming over their favourite restaurant lessons from the past. And this messy row over welfare symbolises the choice it now faces. The time has gone 6.15pm. Our top story this evening. The Chancellor has called for deep spending cuts in some Government departments of up to 40% per. Later on BBC London. Don’t let this happen again - a mother’s concerns over playground safety checks after her five-year-old daughter was crushed by a falling wooden post.

As schools break up for the summer holidays, final preparations are being made in around 50 new free schools which will open in September. The idea behind free schools - which are not controlled by local authorities - was borrowed from the Swedish education system. Sweden once excelled in international education tests, but it hasjust set up a commission to look at why it has fallen further and faster than any other country. Our education editor, Branwen jeffreys, reports. Stockholm, a city that’s built its wealth on knowledge and innovation, but now Sweden wonders if its young people’s future is assecure. Its school system has fallen faster and further than any other country in international tests. We see more students and more pupils than ever before that leave the compulsory school without the knowledge or qualifications to go further in the educational system. I would say that the situation in our education system is the biggest economical risk for Sweden today. They start the day talking about the news at this free school. It was set up by a profit-making chain that also runs some Academy schools in England. Free schools are very well-established in Sweden, an idea of course that we borrowed in the UK. The debate here is whether the massive deregulation that created many more independent schools has been part of the problem. Before these children were born, Sweden introduced a voucher system. More choice for parents, more competition for council schools from free schools. But the gap between the best and worst schools in Sweden has got bigger. It’s hard to untangle why, but it’s left free schools defending their contribution. Where there are free schools, quality is higher. Where there actually is competition between schools. So it has increased the quality. It’s time to test the bridges they’ve been building all term. All Swedish schools are putting more effort into maths and science, but teachers as good as this are in short supply. So do these international tests show Sweden has lost its focus and ambition in education? I think they’ve failed to capture innovativeness that we have in our country. I mean, for example, have a look at Skype, Spotify and so on. They’re all from Sweden. We weren’t born that way, were we? I mean, it comes from somewhere. Sweden is competing in a global economy and with other countries producing students that are good at science and good at maths, it needs to do the same to make sure its businesses don’t fall behind. As a country, we’ll never compete with low salaries. We will compete with knowledge and competence and that’s what’s going to generate good GDP growth and as such it all starts with a strong educational system. So while they celebrate the end of their schooldays with a parade, Sweden is wondering how to do better for the next lot. Leaving many asking what the real lessons are for England from its school system. Branwyn jefferies, BBC News, Stockholm. The head of the japanese electronics giant Toshiba has resigned after it was revealed that for years the company had been exaggerating its profits. Other senior executives are also stepping down. Our business editor, Kamal Ahmed, is here. This scandal has rocked one of japan’s most respected companies? Absolutely has. We’ve seen some remarkable images today from japan, just to warn our viewers there are flashing images and flash photography from the start. What you can see from these pictures is the chief executive of Toshiba bowing for16 chief executive of Toshiba bowing for 16 seconds in contrition and apology after the company admitted it overstated profits by £780 million over the past six years. It’s a below to japan’s global reputation. It was only four years ago that owe limp pus, the camera maker, admitted it had fiddled its accounts. It had been involved in supporting japanese organised crime. Toshiba, makes P Cs, DVDs, involved in the nuclear industry. Since the financial crisis it has been trying to hit targets it wasn’t able to do so. Nobody challenged the leadership saying we can’t hit the targets. It was hit by the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011. Went through that, said it was going to hit the targets, it simply wasn’t. There will be a huge clearout. A big blow to japan. There is one bigger point as well. japan has lost its way. In 1980s we bought TVs, cameras from japan. We buy our TVs from Samsung, South Korea japan have struggled to find their way. Some businesses have resorted to corruption to fightback. Kamal, thank you. The Ebola epidemic in West Africa has left over 8,000 children orphaned. As well as having lost their parents in traumatic circumstances these children now carry the social stigma of being ‘ebola orphans’. Since the height of the outbreak, our global health correspondent, Tulip Mazumdar, has been following the fortunes of one orphanage on the outskirts of Freetown in Sierra Leone which has paid a high price for helping the Ebola orphans. Giving thanks for a simple meal and a safe place to stay. Most of these children lost one or both parents to Ebola. Now there’s no family left who’s able or willing to look after them. I’ve returned to meet staff here still grieving their colleague, Augustine Baker, who died of Ebola. I met Augustine as he tried to trace children orphaned by the virus back in january, but within a few weeks of this he was dead, his wife also died. They left three small children, the youngest was just seven months old. Augustine’s mother now cares for them. She says she’ll never let them forget him. We’re very proud of her and their father was a hard-working man. I have to tell them that. The work Augustine started continues. Are you feeling more happy now? We met Mohammed last time we were here. He’s now been reintegrated back into his community and it’s the simple things that delight him. In the morning, when I wake up, and wash my face. After that I wash my body. As I go to school, they give me that lunch. Workers here are coming across fewer Ebola orphans, but they’re increasingly facing a different issue. Some of the children they’ve placed back within communities are now being isolated or even mistreated because of the stigma associated with the virus. People are really rejecting them and they’re being stigmatised and lots of things have been happening to them, but we have been doing our best, at least to talk to these communities not to reject, especially the survived children that have been survived from Ebola. These children will never grow to know their parents, some won’t even remember they existed. This is one of the many tragic legacies of Ebola.

After the First World War there was a generation of pioneers who were driven to trying to push technology to its limits. That gave birth to Blue Bird.

I make no apologies and it was a sound decision, value for money on expert advice, and the idea these are unsafe does not bear scrutiny. But that is not how the Home Secretary saw it. Evidence suggests these are likely to result in serious or life-threatening injuries, but the assessment none the less poses a series of direct and indirect medical results from the years. She also flagged up 67 faults with the way the machines are operated by the commissioner said they had been dealt with. We saw the 67 recommendations and we believe we have addressed all of them. Some of the signage was German and needs to be replaced. Sounds like pretty trivial problems. Back in the main chamber they went further. Every single one of those this use has been satisfactorily dealt with. The idea that these are in any way defective would be to mislead the people of London. The Deputy Maher said he had got sound advice but obviously the Home Secretary has national advice from national experts, and I trust herjudgment more than his. There has been no response from the Home Office but it has the stated that the convincing case for water cannon was not made. So what exactly happens to these water cannon? The Deputy Commissioner were keen to emphasise they are ready for operational use and there may be opportunities in the future when they can obtain a temporary licence, if there was another large incident. For now, it is a normal from the another large incident. For now, it is a normalfrom the Home is a normal from the Home Secretary, and they cost around £580 a month to maintain and stored. One suggestion was that they could be charged out to other forces for training purposes. They will be kept by the Met for training as the Met needs Ioo officers on call at any time to go to Northern Ireland should there be an incident. They will be used for that in the meantime. City Hall also keen to play down any suggestion of a political row. Lots more to come, including, some famous last throws. Park wardens have told BBC London that they carry out daily safety checks on the park equipment that killed a five-year-old girl in Mile End. Alexia Walenkak was playing on a rope hanging between two wooden posts when one of them fell on her. Her mother says she’d unconvinced the right checks were carried out often enough. Alex Bushill reports. The first person to say, let’s go to the park. The memory will stay with all of us. For as long as we live. A grieving mother’s memories. She was just five when she was killed on Friday, crushed by a falling within post as she and friends hung from a rope. I have spoken to one of the park rangers responsible for this playground and he told me he carried out daily checks, and that whole question of what inspections took place when will be at the centre of the investigation. It is of little comfort to the mother who told me know mum should go through what she is during. She has turned to her faith for strength and is questioning of the right checks were carried out. After the accident, when you look at it, you can see thatitis when you look at it, you can see that it is rotten. Her concerns are shared by other mums such as Tracey who lives opposite the playground. They used to do checks a good half an hour before the park opens. Five or six years ago there were cutbacks was no security guards and now checking. So what should London councils be doing to ensure playgrounds are safe? They should have a 3 tiered inspection system routine visual inspections daily and weekly looking for obvious faults. They should have an operational inspection every quarter, and once a year and annual mean inspection looking at long-term safety. We asked for the record of inspections and safety checks but they refused emphasising the investigation is under way. Families with teenage children who traditionally move out of London for their secondary education are now staying put. It’s putting increasing pressure on local authorities to provide enough schools for them. Latest figures show that in the next fiv years there’s going to be a 30,000 shortfall in the number of places available. Yvonne Hall reports. This school out and time to relax. Thoughts of secondary education may be a long way off for these youngsters but families are well aware that London is facing a massive shortage of secondary places. I’ve got to put my one-year-old son on a waiting list from now to get into a good school, so it would be good to have more options. This particular area has a very high birth saw it as a family area with lots of kids and people picking their new home based on school places. There’s a gap in the market because people are struggling to find good schooling young families. It is a no-brainer that they are a small investment in good quality education. Family concerns are backed by new figures released today from the cross-party think tank in London councils. It says there has been unprecedented growth in demand for places and in the next five years schools will have to cope with an extra 73,000 pupils, with 35,000 new places needed. There’s huge concern and local government has already put £1 billion into providing primary school places. We are running out of money quite frankly to carry on subsidising what government should be spending so we need the government to step up, find the 35 Thousand Place shortage we have coming. This overgrown derelict stretch of land as we are one of London’s new secondary schools will be built to cope with the growing demand, next to a community hospital. It will be a nonselective academy and is due to open in September next year. The government still has to agree funding. The charity supporting free school says the quality of any new places created is crucial. It is shocking to think that in London, nearly one in eight students is any secondary school not rated as good, saw lots has to be addressed. Despite the predicted shortage, parents are being reassured that every child will be offered a secondary place, evenif will be offered a secondary place, even if it has to be in a makeshift classroom. More than 70 firefighters have tackled a blaze at a pallet yard in Enfield. Fire crews tried to cool down gas cylinders to prevent them from exploding. Local residents have been asked to close their doors and windows to stop smoke getting into their homes. A man from Chelmsford who challenged a parking fine imposed by a private car park operator has taken his legal battle to the Supreme Court today. Barry Beavis from Chelmsford was fined £85 after staying 56 minutes beyond the two hours allowed. He’s already lost two appeals but his lawyers argue the charges are ""unfair, unlawful and disproportionate"". Two months ago Varsha Maisuria from Hendon was killed along with her instructor when her parachute became caught in the aircraft they were jumping from, causing it to crash. The company she booked with claim her death in Mexico was a tragic accident, but her brothers are now calling for tighter regulations. Sheetal Parmar reports. Skydiving in Mexico was a dream come true for Varsha Maisuria, but this is how it ended. This mobile phone footage was taken seconds after the plane with Varsha Maisuria and her skydiving instructor still attached to the fuselage. There were some first responders that arrived and the plane was afloat for about ten minutes. The pilot was recovered. Unfortunately there was no sign of my sister or her instructor. Varsha Maisuria was on holiday on the West coast of Mexico in May. She was an experienced traveller having worked for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office for 15 years but memories are all her family have left. We needed to find out what happened and needed to look into the possibility and the hope that our sister could still be alive, and try and do everything in our power through any means to bring her home. Varsha Maisuria’s family now it is unlikely her body will ever be recovered and they want to warn other British holiday-makers of the risks they could face abroad. It is better, safer and potentially more secure to go through an approved holiday tourist operator. Companies need to have a greater level of insurance to protect customers and I put that to the skydiving company. I want to confirm we do not have insurance for skydivers as it is extremely expensive. I have jumped all over the world and it is the same in many countries. It is the reason why we ask customers to sign a waiver. The family are also concerned about the training the instructor had received prior to the jump. The instructor was qualified with 500 jumps but had neverjumped off that kind of plane with my sister, and had my sister is known that fact we are 100% sure she would not have gone ahead with the jump itself. The company claimed this wouldn’t have made a difference and a freak set of circumstances led to the crash, but the family say the loss should serve as a warning to other travellers of the potential dangers of extreme sports abroad. Still to come, 20 years since songs for the New World was performed on Broadway. We talked to the cusp of a new London production about what makes this a unique piece of musical theatre. And the capital’s most famous dinosaur skeleton starts looking for the new home. Violette Szabo is one of the great heroines of the Second World War. She lived in Brixton and when war broke out became a British secret agent working in Occupied France until her capture and execution aged just 23. After her death she was awarded the George Cross and now it’s being auctioned in London by her daughter Tania. Gareth Furby has more. We are inside an auctioneer’s in Mayfair. In the room where they keep the medals, they are preparing one of the most historic. It is undoubtedly one of the most special British awards I have handled in my career. It’s a George Cross and you can tell it was awarded to a woman, because it hangs below a wide bow of blue ribbon. She was Violette Szabo, a special operations agent from Brixton who was executed in the Second World War after being captured. Open your eyes, tell me, and then you can sleep. Her life story was made into a film called Carve Her Name With pride. The life that I have is all that I have and the life that I have is yours. Her medal was awarded posthumously and presented to her daughter in 1946, who now, all these years later, has decided to auction it. They need a new home, I’m getting old, and that sometime I won’t be here and I don’t have any children. Along with the George Cross, tomorrow’s auction will include other medals and some poignant remembers of her role as a special agent. I was struck by this which is a signed statement by Violette Szabo in respect of the guardianship of her daughter in the event that she didn’t return from her duties in France. And this is undoubtedly a souvenir, if you like, that Violette Szabo brought back to England from her first mission to France in April 191+1+. You think of the incalculable risks she was running as the special operations executive agent at that time. I find that really one of the most moving and poignant items of the archive. The presale estimate is 250,000 to £300,000, which ever achieved would be the highest price ever paid at auction for a George Cross, but this has an extraordinary history. Hashtag SaveDippy was a massive campaign on social media back in january when the Natural History Museum announced it was to move the skeleton that’s graced the museum entrance for 35 years. Despite that public uproar, the museum is going ahead and replacing the diplidocus with a blue whale. But now they’re looking to send Dippy on tour. Well, jean McKenzie is at the Natural History Museum for us tonight. jean, pretty exciting news. Yes, very exciting, because this is not your average exhibit. It is the cast of a skeleton of a crippled or dinosaur and cast of a skeleton of a crippled or dinosaurand is dinosaur and is made up of nearly 300 bones. -- dinosaur and is made up of nearly 300 bones. -- diplodocus. It has been centrestage here for as long as some can remember. Many will have seen it first when just a child school trip so they are really was dismay when the museum announced it was going to replace Dippy with the skeleton of a blue whale. It has decided that when it is replaced it will go on tour to various museums across the UK. Here to tell us more about that is the head of conservation year. Do tell us why he has to go? It is part of our plan that we want to bring in an original specimen of a massive blue whale skeleton as part of our plan to give the public and education about natural history. And tell us a bit about how it will work. How are you going to decide what museums get to have heart? First, we want to call everyone in the UK to see if they could hose Dippy. We want to make sure they are big enough and secure enough. It needs to be an indoor venue and there are number of things we are asking, but we also want Dippy to travel the length and breadth of the UK. And this is the biggest exhibit you have ever loaned out. Are you not a little nervous? I would be lying if I wasn’t but I have looked after the specimen for more than 30 years and not very well. We know it will be very safe when it moves so we feel confident Dippy will not be damaged in any way. Still two years to go until he goes on to it and when she returns from her travels and there will still be a home for her at the Museum, just not here. Now, at the age of 80 most people are slowing down, rather than breaking sporting records. Not so for Warwick Dixon from Dartford, who’s been throwing the hammer for more than 60 years and hasjust broken the British Record in his age group. Ian Palmer has been to meet him. Even though he has been throwing the hammer for more than 50 years, you’re never too old to improve your technique. Until last Tuesday I was thinking all the weight on the left turn and you turn down that side. Now I am being told he weight is on your right foot because you have something to push off and going on the left is a weak position, so I am trying to incorporate quite a few new to me ideas, in the hope that it pays off in the long run. Warwick Dixon was persuaded to switch from the discus to the hammer while serving in the Armed Forces. Within a year he was representing Great Britain and breaking records. After downpours, conditions were terrible. He came second in the championship at 1961, an event with a world-class field. He continued to compete into his 75th year, stopping only to care for his life. In May this year, he began competing again. He is not a great one for training but loves the competition aspect and it is great for everybody. At 80, in your mind, you’re still 20. You just don’t grow up your head. Last week, he broke the British record for his age group, of more than 35 metres. Itjust needs to be verified in order to count as a new British record. Fortunately, I think I have managed to pull some famous last throws out, on the day. He continues to pit his skills against the best. This weekend he is off to a meet in Birmingham and after that an international competition in France awaits. The Color Purple catapulted Cynthia Erivo to theatre stardom and now the south London actress has landed a role on Broadway, staring alongside jennifer Hudson with Oprah Winfrey as one of her producers. But before she treads the boards in New York she’s in the lead role of a new London musical. Our Entertainment Correspondent Brenda Emmanus has caught up with her. It has been described as an abstract musical, a series of songs connected by a theme, moments of life changing decisions. London are Cynthia Erivo joined the cast of four in Songs For a New World. It is a musical that captures people at moments of ecstasy and dire Straits, so you get bits of people’s lives and we are buying to join them together so you get a bit of everything. It is slightly abstract but we are trying to give you something. A television programme kept her co-star from a chance to an original production of the short 18 years ago. jennifer Russell left the show. Luckily for me, the series lasted four years so it was worth doing, but I really felt terrible for letting them down. The production went ahead and did very well, but it has been unfinished business, and I am really glad that 18 years later I get another start. In The Color Purple was a clear defining moment for Cynthia Erivo. She reprised the role on Broadway. just to be able to go back to have and I talk as if she has a deal person. It fills me with the ofjoy because I loved playing that character. Broadway will no doubt be an emotionally charged expedience for Cynthia, a feeling she hopes audiences will share with Songs For a New World. Now lets get a check on the Weather with Sara Thornton. Not quite as lovely tomorrow but it has been a beautiful day and it has been fresher than yesterday, but that didn’t equate to cooler weather. We did well with lots of sunshine and a top temperature of 26 Celsius. I willjust draw your attention to this cloud, it might just try to push one or two showers towards us, but generally most dying away. We keep clearly clear skies and the temperature will stay up at around 11+ Celsius, but nowhere near as humid as last night. A pretty nice day tomorrow, but a bit more clouds around and the better chance of seeing a show through the afternoon. A lot of the heaviest ones towards the north-west but you will see the cloud thickening up and all of us at risk of a shower. A top temperature of 23 Celsius, and it is because of this weather front moving towards us. The showers could be quite sharp through the afternoon into the evening but it clears away nicely and then to Thursday, largely dry and settled. Cool around fresher to start and plenty of sunshine, prior and nice indeed. to start and plenty of sunshine, priorand nice indeed. The temperature again coming down a little into Thursday afternoon, looking at highs of around 22 Celsius. Then Friday, if you’re watching this, last night I was saying Friday had some question marks and here is why. This area of low pressure are moving towards us, the northerly extent open to question. All of us could see some by the end of the day and overnight into Saturday but Saturday, pressure building again so should be pleasant indeed. The main headlines tonight. The Chancellor has called for radical change in government departments to save £20 billion, Some budgets will be protected but those that aren’t will be asked to look at privatisation, selling land or contracting out services to cut costs. Surgeons have performed the world’s first bionic eye implant to restore the vision of a patient with age-related macular degeneration. An 80 year old man was fitted with the implant at Manchester Royal Eye Hospital. South Yorkshire police has been told it still needs to make major improvements to some of its child protection procedures. An independent report revealed that 11+00 children had been sexually exploited and rather more than a 16 year period. The head of policing has said the Home Secretary was wrong to overrule the use of water cannon in the capital. Last week Theresa May said 67 problems had been found. He said they had all been addressed. London is facing a shortfall of 35,000 secondary school places over the next five years. A report by London councils claimed the lack of friend -- report by London councils claimed the lack of friend -- a lack of funding meant some places may struggle to cope. I will be back later but for now, from everyone on the team, have a lovely evening. From the rainforests of Tasmania to the jungle of the Death Railway, writer Richard Flanagan tells the story behind his Booker Prize-winning novel. I knew it was this novel I had to write, really, if I was ever to write another book. For expanding our minds... THE PIPS 'Good morning, everybody. It’s Nick Grimshaw...' Forwaking us up... ..and getting us going. For making us laugh... ..and making us cry. For expanding our minds... ..and taking us to new worlds. For hopes... The winner is... ..and dreams. The waiting is over! For notjust watching... RADIO: Well done, Paul, very funny. ..but living too. For all the days of our lives... ..and all the moments we share. For all of us. There’s a lot we don’t know about the food on our plates. And the shops and the labels don’t always tell you the whole story. You think you’re getting a bargain and you’re not really, they’re just encouraging you to buy more of a product when you don’t need to. Whether you’re staying in or going out, you’ve told us you can feel ripped off by promises made about what you eat and what you pay for it. What really winds me up, I suppose, is the price of so-called healthy food in comparison with the unhealthy stuff. The unhealthy stuff seems to be so much cheaper. From claims that just don’t stack up, to the secrets behind the packaging, we’ll uncover the truth about Britain’s food, so that you can be sure that you’re getting what you expect at the right price. Your food, your money, this is Rip-Off Britain. Hello, and welcome to Rip-Off Britain, where in this series, we’re investigating some of the questions and problems that you’ve sent us to do with food. Every day seems to bring with it a new scare story or scientific study, sometimes totally contradicting what has been said in the past. You know, we can end up spending as much time talking about our food, as actually eating it. Today, we’ll be finding out more about some of the food, drinks and ingredients that have made the headlines or caused controversy. So get ready for some surprises as we find the truth. It isn’t always what you expected. Coming up - would you know which of these everyday treats packs the most calories? Custard AND chocolate. Custard and chocolate, that. Do you think that’s the most? Yeah. But wine’s fattening. So is beer. And a woman who thinks nothing about sprinkling 30-year-old herbs into her dinner. So, are those ancient ingredients in your cupboard still safe to eat? They’re a bit, er, vintage really. But it doesn’t matter to me, as long as they smell all right and they taste all right, then I’ll use ‘em. British farmers have used pesticides for decades, but there are those who remain very sceptical about using them at all and would even question whether they are safe. So to find out if there IS anything to worry about, or whether pesticides really are the key to keeping prices low and the quality high, we have done a test and I must tell you, the results are quite surprising. As the supermarket wars continue apace, one of the key battlegrounds remains the fresh fruit and veg aisle and most shoppers will be looking for the freshest, the juiciest ",,
74,BBC News 24,21-jul-2015,BBC News at Ten,22:00,30 mins,True,"In sensible savings for public services. We will be asking where the main cuts are likely to be targeted. Also tonight, in Manchester-- Manchester, a bionic eye implant gives hope to millions suffering from sight loss. Another protest by French ferry workers causes disruption at the Channel Tunnel with thousands failing delays. The north Koreans set to work in Russia. And 90 years after Sir Malcolm Campbell’s land-speed record the Bluebird flies against in Wales. And coming up in Sportsday on BBC News, England’s women restore ashes pride, inflicting defeat on Australia for the first time in 11 one day internationals. To take the lead in the series. Good evening, the Chancellor has asked some Whitehall departments to prepare for cuts of up to 40% in their budgets over the next four years. George Osborne was launching the Government spending review, the outcome will be announced in the autumn. His aim is to find extra savings of round 20 billion to meet the target of eliminating the deficit. Our chief political correspondent is with me here, with more details. The Spending Review in November will be a clear statement of the Government’s priorities for the next few years. We know of course that they are looking for significant savings. £20 billion over four years. Some departments including transport, local Government, and the Home Office are being asked to come UP Home Office are being asked to come up with plans for cuts of 25 and 40%. Those levels would bring even bigger savings. Others have their funding protected, including the NHS, school, defence, international aid, and national security. The Chancellor says the target is tough, but achievable. Today we are setting out the next part of our plan, to eeliminate the deficit and ensure or country lives within its mean, We will invest in the National Health Service and our national security, elsewhere Government departments will have to find significant savings through efficiency, and by also giving people much greater control over their own live, and the lives of their communities. Which means cities like match what match -- Manchester will have more say in how money is spent in their area. George Osborne is offering other places like Birmingham and Newcastle radical devolution of power. There is no proof this saves money but the hopeis is no proof this saves money but the hope is that pushing decision making out of London will improve efficiency. More controversial will be efficiency. More controversial will be a further tighten of the police budgetlet back in 2012,000s of officers took to streets to from test. Forces are braced for more, and across Whitehall, Government departments know they will have to do more for less. It will be harder to do additional efficiency savings, you are probably looking at more fundamental change to the way that we do thing, is it. Possible? I wouldn’t want to say that, will it be hard? Yes it will. I think departments are already coming up with serious and bold savings, but some of thisjust becomes completely unmanageable. Perhaps he’s setting the bar high and he’ll appear to be the good guy if it’s less when push comes to shove. He’s got to be I think a bit more honest about what he is actually planning here because he said in the Budget speech he was stepping off that roller-coaster ride in public spending plans, and then he’s telling his Cabinet colleagues to make deeper cuts than he was planning only a fortnight previously. So he’s got to make his mind up. The Treasury seems to have decided though, pointing to ministers like Michael Gove, the justice Secretary, praising his plans to sell off Victorian jails and bring in private firms to deliver services. Some think it’s time to go even further. Ido think that probably we are getting close to the end of the road of salami slicing, where we really do needed to think about doing something more radical. As I say, actually shutting down entire departments. Deciding what it is what we want the Government to concentrate on and have it get out of other areas where it really shouldn’t be doing things. What’s clear from today’s plan is that while ministers are keen to save money, they’re also seriously considering fundamental changes to the way the state spends your money. The Chancellor is urging ministers to be as radical as possible. Huw. What would the cuts look like. Let us talk to Robert best son. What kind of impact would that will have? You have heard me banging on for months, about how productivity in this country, that is the output we get for each unit of cost, just isn’t good enough, and that is a particular problem in the public sector, there is a shocking statistic in the Treasury’s document today, which is that the best school, secondary schools spend £200 on administration for each pupil, the worst spend £11+00. Now, if you could get back off the administration costs down from 11+00, in lots of schools that would release lots of additional money for what we think is important. Educating kids. Now of course school funding is protected but in other departments you have heard from Vicky, transport, law and order, big cuts being looked for up to 1+0%, some can come from efficiency savings, but huge amounts of that were done in the last Parliament, the easy stuff. Ordering paperclips and coms better, eliminating duplication, it will be much more challenging. The Chancellor has said that he wants whole services reinvented, perhaps they could be delivered over smartphone, the record of civil servants in IT has been completely lamentable. So the big question is whether or not there are some services that we take for granted -- are some services that we take for granted -- granted as being delivered by the Government that will no longer backbench delivered in that way. The reason that has got to be a plausible outcome, some would say a shocking outcome, is we think about what it would mean in your own life in your income was cut by 1+0% in inflation adjusted termses, you would have to stop doing all sorts of things that you currently ta ke for doing all sorts of things that you currently take for granted, probably could afford a car, you would have to get your kids to sleep in the same room and rent out the same room to a lodger, we are talking about cuts on this scale, we are talking about recreating the public sector. Surgeons in Manchester have created a bionic eye implant to tackle the most common cause of sight loss in the developed world. An 80-year-old man with age-related macular degeneration was fitted with the implant, which in time is expected to produce a significant improvement in his vision. Our medical correspondent Fergus Walsh was given exclusive access and this is what he found. This is what the world looks like to Ray Flynn. His central sight is gone and he relies entirely on his peripheral vision. He told me it severely limits daily what he can do. Hi, Ray. I cannot use the cash machines. I’d like to be able to go shopping and finding things and doing my own PIN but my brother has to do all that. He has to do everything. Ray has dry, age-related macular degeneration, AMD, which affects mainly the elderly and happens when the cells in part of the retina become damaged. A few hours later the surgical team at Manchester Royal Eye Hospital are ready to wrap this, the retinal implant, around the back of Ray’s right eye. A world first for his condition. Age-related macular degeneration is the most common cause of sight loss in the developed world. At least half a million people in the UK are affected, so there is vast potential for any technology which can improve visual function and enhance quality-of-life. This is how it works. The patient wears special glasses which have a built-in video camera. The visual information is wirelessly transmitted to the retinal implant on the eye. Electrodes stimulate the retina’s remaining cells to send the visual signals to the brain to interpret. Two weeks after surgery, the key moment as the bionic eye is switched on. Please close your eyes. Ray is asked to keep his eyes closed during the test so the team can be sure that whatever he sees must come from the implant relaying information from the camera on his glasses. Success. Vertical. Horizontal. Oh, it was wonderful, I had my eyes closed and I saw the bars on there, it was really good. For his surgeon, it is highly significant. This provides hope to patients not only with this condition, but also other patients with loss of central vision due to degenerative diseases, so this is just the beginning. This could be the beginning of a new era. This implant would cost £150,000 if not part of a clinical trial like this one. It can’t deliver fine visual detail like a human eye, but the technology is improving and this is a milestone in the development of bionic sight. Fergus Walsh, BBC News, Manchester. A 21+-year-old man from Luton has appeared in court accused of planning to murder a member of the US military in Britain. He has also been charged with attempting to join snowcat Islamic State in Syria, along with his uncle. Daniel Sanford has the story. After seven days of questioning in Southwark police station, the two men from Luton were brought to Westminster magistrates court in an armoured police vehicle. Shazib Khan add janead Khan, uncle and nephew, both for grey tracksuit and were both charged with trying to join so-called Islamic State in Syria. But janead Khan, a delivery driver, also faces a much more serious charge, one of planning to attack US military personnel here in Britain. The allegation is that janead Khan planned to stage a vehicle accident, to run down an American serviceman and then kill him with a knife. It is a method of attack that has echoes of the murder of Lee Rigby two years ago. Thousands of US air force personnel work in East Anglia, in places like REF Lakenheath, faces that were on janead Khan’s roots as a driver for logistics company in Luton. The two men were arrested in police raids last week, using specialist firearm officers. The districtjudge said both men should be held in prison until the next court appearance at the Old Bailey injust under three weeks’ time. Strike action by French ferry workers has caused more disruption around the port of Calais. The workers set fire to a pile of tyres and blocked the motorway leading to the Channel Tunnel. The sale of its ships. A new tactic up in print strikes to cause as much disruption as possible and bring the summer traffic to a halt. If you thought it would do to a British tourist from using the route, you might be surprised. Eurostar says it has enjoyed a record few months and the owner of this wine market in Calais has also seen more British shoppers this summer, thanks to the weak euro, which makes French wine even cheaper. Kevin is heading back to Ireland tonight but says he doesn’t know what to expect. Using the Channel Tunnel would seem to be a good idea, we did that on the way down and went swiftly, as they say. Really, really good. But now we are having second thoughts on the way home, because it is a little bit dodgy out there. It is the UK’s side I worry about, Kevin told me, and today, he would be right. With several ferries unavailable, queues were up to eight miles long. But delays here are now seen almost standard, with part of the motorway reserved for trucks waiting to get into France. Protest here have only added to Calais’s other long-running problems. An industrial dispute which causes major disruption and long trafficjams isn’t only of interest to British tourists, but also to the town’s growing population of migrants, who used the long queues to climb on trucks. Whichever way you turn, holiday destinations are not meant to look like this. Funerals have been held in the southern Turkish town of Suruc for the 32 people killed in yesterday’s bomb attack. The attack targeted a group of young student activists who were planning to go to Syria to help rebuild the Kurdish city of Kobane. Turkey says it has identified a suspect and has accused so-called Islamic State of being behind the attack. In the past hour, the technology giant Apple has released its latest results, eagerly awaited by the financial markets as it’s a very busy year for the company. Not only did they bring out their latest phone, the iPhone six, but they also also launched the Apple watch and the Applepay mobile payment system to the UK. Our business editor Kamal Ahmed has the latest. ~ I suppose the figures, first of all? As ever with apple, they live in a slightly parallel universe, such is the huge amount of revenue they get every year and the huge profits they make, these results over the last 1+0 minutes. Revenues for Q3, three months up until the end ofjuly, $50 billion, £32 billion. Profits, 11th billion dollars, £7 billion, up 1+0% on the same period last year. China is going crazy for the iPhone, the middle classes are really buying the iPhone 6, sales are up sharply. They sold 1+1+ million iPhone in a three-month period, an increase of around 35% from a year earlier. What is interesting is the average price of each of those iPhones hit $660, an increase of $100 on the same time last year. Their profit margins are close to 1+0%, something they are tested on in the financial markets. Not a lot of detail on the watch, they say they are selling more watches in the launch period of the watch than they sold in comparison for the iPhone and the iPad, so they are not dampening expectations, but no actual numbers for that. But weirdly, the share prices down, because this is the mad world of Apple. If Apple is not hitting records every single time it announces its sales, investors think maybe some of the cream is coming off. I don’t think these results show that. IPad sales are down slightly in Europe, so there are some headwinds, but the CEO has certainly said these are a record set of results. Thanks very much. The Labour MPs who rebelled against the leadership in last night’s vote on welfare reform have been accused by some colleagues of undermining the party. 1+8 Labour backbenchers voted against the Welfare Bill, despite being urged by their acting leader Harriet Harman to abstain. Of the four Labour leadership contenders, onlyjeremy Corbyn voted against. Our political correspondent Ben Wright has the story. It was a thumping defeat. The party lost its leader and big names lost their seats. Across the country, devastated activists asked what went wrong and how should Labour change? THE SPEAKER: Division. Clear the lobby. But division there was last night, as Labour MPs split, not only over the Government Welfare Bill, but where it they stand as a party. 1+8 MPs defied their acting leader, Harriet Harman, and voted against the benefit curb set out in the Budget. Even new Labour MPs, elected in May, took different positions. So I brought two of them here to hear why. If Labour had a works canteen, this would be it. A memorabilia packed place where the party has dined for decades. Cat Smith was one of the 18 new Labour MPs to rebel. I had been contacted by constituents who were concerned with the content of the Bill and were asking me to oppose it. The truth of the matter is that we are the official opposition and I was expected to act like the official opposition and oppose this Bill. Trade union leaders, like Len McCluskey, were furious with Labour’s decision not to oppose the Government’s welfare cuts, but Stephen Kinnock did abstain in last night’s vote and said Labour needed to show it was listening to voters. We’ve got to be a smart opposition opposing where we need to oppose, not opposing and being constructive and demonstrating that we’ve got the Statesman-like qualities which are going to take us back to power in 2020. Not our finest hour. This is a party crying out for leadership now. Andy Burnham, the candidate seen as the party’s leadership favourite, also abstained last night. But... Our position, in my view, wasn’t strong enough. It’s why, as leader, I would oppose this Bill outright. At a leadership hustings this evening, welfare was barely mentioned, even by the only contender to vote against the Government last night, the left-wingerjeremy Corbyn, the man who seems to have momentum. The Labour Party has got to recognise we can no longer go into the next election offering austerity light. We’ve got to offer some different economic strategy. How can Labour win again? Looming over the party’s favourite restaurant are lessons from the past. This messy row over welfare symbolises the choice it now faces. Ben Wright, BBC News, Soho. North Korea says it’s facing its worst drought in a century and the United Nations has warned of the danger of mass starvation. One of the few sources of badly-needed cash is to supply overseas labour, so President Kim jong Un has expanded the number of worker brigades he sends overseas. Tens of thousands of North Korean labourers now work in Russia, many of them in the construction industry, in the remote far east of the country. Human rights groups say it’s a form of slave labour. Stephen Sackur sent this exclusive report from Vladivostok, on Russia’s eastern coast. There is a building boom in Russia’s far east, but the workers here aren’t Russian, they’re from secretive, totalitarian North Korea. They live in guarded compounds. Human rights groups call it state-sponsored slave labour, designed to earn foreign currency for President Kim jong Un’s regime. Unsurprisingly, outsiders are not welcome. Stop. It’s hard to talk to the North Korean labourers, they’re petrified of stepping out of line, they have families back home. One agreed to talk to me, anonymously. We had no option. We had to come here. I would have preferred to stay at home. We come here, we work and then we return. How much money do you earn here? I don’t know. How can anyone know that? We do not get a salary. In Vladivostok, some high-profile state-funded construction projects, like this bridge, have been built with the help of North Korean labour, they’re cheap and reliable and for Russian developers it pays not to ask questions. TRANSLATION: I have a job that needs to be done and they deliver results for me. But human rights groups say that these North Korean workers are basically state-sponsored slave labourers, how do you feel about that? I closed my eyes long ago. I no longer take an interest in it. But there’s a human cost, catalogued by rights workers like Svetlana. So this is a police raid when they came to pick up him, the North Korean? Workers from North Korea who run away and seek refugee status in Russia are routinely handed back to Kim jong Un’s regime. Of course it’s illegal because the persons have rights to appeal for refugee status. So you think that right now Moscow is violating international human rights law? I’m sure, unfortunately, that it is so. By sending labour brigades abroad, Kim jong Un can pocket hard cash while his people live on the edge of starvation. These workers are stuck in a twilight zone, temporarily out of North Korea’s totalitarian nightmare, but still under Kim jong Un’s control. Russia is happy to put them to work and look the other way. Stephen Sackur, BBC News, Vladivostok. Students from the poorest backgrounds in England will graduate owing up to £53,000 after maintenance grants are replaced by loans, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The thinktank says many graduates will only earn enough to repay a quarter of their debt. The Government says it’s committed to widening access to higher education. Tonight, we hear from two students about the challenges of paying for higher education. MY My name is Kevin Wilson, I am from the University of the West of England in Bristol, reading sociology. I am a second-year student at the London School of economic. It is vitally important to me as a disabled student to actually get the maintenance grant. I can’t really work while I am studying server maintenance grant will support and supplement my income whilst I am at university. My grand Lodge recovers mY university. My grand Lodge recovers my food costs, sometimes my travel. It is not a huge amount of money but it is the difference, it covers the things I’m not able to as my parents for come from a low income family. -- ask my parents. Coming from a family where we earn less than £25,000 a year, that is more than three years of my household income you are asking, and I have never seen that amount of money before is asking me to sign up for that level of debt... It wouldn’t stop me going to university because I’m driven to go, I want to do the course I am on. If they stop the maintenance grant, it will deter me from going to university because it has been so instrumental in covering my living costs. It shouldn’t put them off going from university because they will get more money to spend, not less, and that was a real barrier for many students and in many respects, the Government is responding to that by giving them more money. What it does mean is they repay more when they graduate. But that shouldn’t put them off going to university because by that time, they will be earning a salary. Some thought there on the challenges of paying for higher education in England. It is 90 years ago that Sir Malcolm Campbell said a land speed record at Pendyne Sands in South Wales. Today, his grandson drove the same car on the same stretch of sand and our correspondent was there to see it. Flying once more on the coast of South Wales. Bluebird’s engine has not roared like this since the 1920s. It started a race for the record books. Sir Malcolm Campbell took the wheel 90 years ago, the car had already claimed two land speed titles. Essentially an aircraft on wheels, he pushed its engine harder and faster than ever before, reaching 150.71+ mph. It is really a petrol head’s dream, a special car with a massive history and engine and all the power you could possibly need. The only restriction is the technology of the tyres and the chassis. Even now, this car commands a crowd, thousands have come here to see being driven, part of the 1920s post-war pioneering history. Today’s drive was not at full throttle, moving at a more modest 50 mph. It meant spectators did see more thanjust a blue blur, while Sir Malcolm Campbell’s grandson got to enjoy the ride. A fantastic ride. To get the sand smashing in your face and the noise and the exhaust coming at you is a fabulous experience, it really is. In its wake, several cars and speedboats have adopted its name as others sought to break new records. Today showed how the original still had the power to inspire.

Scientists in America unveil results of trials of a drug which appears to slow its progress. Nothing at the moment can stop the death of brain cells in Alzheimer’s patients. The new drug, solanezumab, may be able to slow that process down. ~ Iam very I am very excited by these findings because I think we could be on the verge of a breakthrough, and a radical breakthrough, for therapy for people with Alzheimer’s disease. We’ll be assessing the breakthrough with our medical correspondent. Also this lunchtime... Tony Blair warns Labour against coming from a traditional leftist platform, as a poll puts left-wingerjeremy Corbyn ahead in the leadership battle. A fatal accident inquiry gets under way into last December’s bin lorry crash in Glasgow, in which six people died. Mechanical failure was not an issue. Four Chelsea supporters received bands for an alleged racist incident in Paris. People who operate drones are being warned they could be prosecuted - and evenjailed - if they don’t obey safety rules. What may be the world’s oldest fragments On BBC London: A memorial service for the death ofjohn Charles Makro. -- de Menezes. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. Scientists believe they may have made a breakthrough in the fight against Alzheimer’s disease. More than half a million people live with the disease in the UK and, until now, there’s been no way of stopping it. But researchers in America believe they have found a way of slowing its progression if the disease is diagnosed early. It could open the door to future treatments, as our medical correspondent, Fergus Walsh, reports. What we could do in September is go to Greece now the banks are working. Alzheimer’s disease is robbing Roz Underwood of her ability to communicate. She and her husband, jeremy, first noticed the decline 8I’OUI’Id two yâ8IâS 890. You sort of stop thinking, and you go, I can’t remember what I am doing, this sort of thing. It isjust... It is terrible really, rather terrible. You feel... I think the awful thing is, it makes you feel useless. The treatment to slow the loss of brain cells in Alzheimer’s would mark a huge moment. Early clinical data has suggested a drug called solanezumab can slow the pace of decline in those with early Alzheimer’s disease. New data just released has shown that improvement was maintained for at least two years. These findings are hugely significant in the sense that it is the first data we have had which is consistent with a drug actually slowing down the course of the disease. I am very excited by these findings because I think we could be on the verge of a breakthrough - a radical breakthrough - for therapy for people with Alzheimer’s disease. In the UK every year around 225,000 people develop dementia. Alzheimer’s disease is by far the most common form. The new drug might eventually benefit those in the earlier stages of the disease. Alzheimer’s disease leads to the build-up of abnormal proteins in the brain, which clumped together into packs and lead to cognitive decline and the loss of brain function. The drug works by clearing some of the plaques and apparently slowing this decline. A note of caution. We cannot be sure whether solanezumab is effective until the result of another trial are released at the end of next yâ8I’. And Fergus is here. Even given that, how significant is this? This is not a breakthrough. It might be. No other disease area would we be giving such significance to such preliminary data which is still being analysed. That is because it is dementia and that is because there has been a death of progress in the last 25 years. Something like £37 billion has been spent on research. 101+ drugs have been tested. Only three have come to market and been licensed. None of those actually slows the rate of progression of the disease. Some of them just treat the symptoms. That is why this is exciting. It is exciting because what it tries to do. It tries to deal with these sticky of protein in the brain that appear to lead to the loss of brain cells. Exciting because there are lots of other drugs that are targeting that. It’ll be the end of next year before we can be absolutely certain whether we do have the first drug that slows the progress of Alzheimer’s disease. Then it would have to be licensed. Probably three years before it would come to market. It has to be taken very much in the early stages of the disease so it is not something, unfortunately, for patients now, but patients in the future. The former Labour Prime Minister, Tony Blair, has warned his party against a shift to the left, saying it would be a backward step. Mr Blair’s comments came as an opinion poll for the Times suggested that the left winger jeremy Corbyn was ahead in the race for the Labour leadership. Our political reporter Ross Hawkins reports. From 100 to one outsider to a contender in a month. Is this left wing at the next leader of the Labour Party? One well- known wing at the next leader of the Labour Party? One well-known member this morning was asked, ironically, whether he would backjeremy Corbyn? Are you putting jeremy first or second? Actually that is the Tory preference. I am a Labour leader, second? Actually that is the Tory preference. Iam a Labour leader, or was. So, no. Thenjeremy Corbyn never thought much of Tony Blair. Tonyis never thought much of Tony Blair. Tony is entitled to his own opinions. I have many analyses of his leadership. We did win the election and support consistently after lap and he led us into a disastrous and illegal war. He had this reflection on the unfinished enquiry into the Iraq War. I think Tony Blair’s big problem is we are still waiting for the Chilcott report to come out. It is getting so heated because both sides know Labour turned to the left after it lost to her, and do so again. The Labour Party persuaded itself that the reason why the country had voted for Margaret Thatcher was because they wanted a really left-wing Labour Party. This is what I call the theory that the electorate is stupid. After Blair swept away, some of those invited to hear him gathered to agree. We will not win again by shifting left, hinting the public was wrong. Far to the left has not worked out in the past. One poll suggests many disagree with them and over 1+0% of leadership of leadership voters plan to make jeremy Corbyn that first choice. Pollsters are cautious. Think of this like a snapshot of the Grand National halfway through the race. It is reasonably clear roughly what the state of play is now also what it will be in six weeks’ the state of play is now also what it will be in six weeks’ time is another matter entirely. So, polls could be wrong but what is certain is while Tony Blair defeated the Labour left in the 1990s, it is the left-wingers who are now emboldened. He could perhaps be the 1 who benefits. Our assistant political editor Norman Smith is in Westminster. The intervention of a former Labour Prime Minister, just how helpful or not is that to Labour? Simon, I am here at a speech whichjeremy Corbyn has been getting. If I was one of his advisers and thought, how could I come up with an idea to put even more meant behind this campaign, I would think, fantastic idea! Let’s get Tony Blair to make a big speech attacking the left. That is precisely what he has done and, bluntly, it has put rocket fuel behind the Corbyn campaign. People here are now beginning to believe the previously unbelievable, that jeremy Corbyn could, indeed, uncomplicated message. He is anti-austerities, anti-benefit cuts, anti-wars abroad, anti-Trident. That message, as in Greece or Spain, as in Scotland, resonate with many people. Secondly, his rivals, frankly, have failed to come up with a counter narrative. They have failed to inspire and, often, bluntly, they have failed to interest many Labour Party members. Lastly, there is history. Again and again, after shattering defeats, Labour has opted for comfort zones league -- Labour has opted for comfort zones league -- leaders. Leaders who will wrap the great big comfort blanket around the Labour Party. That is what Tony Blair was warning about. Although many people did not like what Tony Blair had to say, the fact is, he knew a thing or two about winning elections. Norman, thank you very much. A British woman has died while bungee jumping from a bridge in Spain. Kleyo De Abreu, who was 23 and from London, was killed close to the mountain village of Lanjaron in the Andalucia region. Elizabeth Glinka reports. This is a well-known bungee site, popular with local adventure and knees who charge around 35 euros for the chance to dive into the ravine below. On a normal day, jumpers are helped to dismount on the older Stonebridge beneath. Yesterday afternoon something went wrong. Police say a possible miscalculation with the rope was one line of enquiry. Local officials say 23-year-old enquiry. Local officials say 23-year-old Kleyo De Abreu was staying with family in the region and that her aunt was present when she jumped. and that her aunt was present when shejumped. It is and that her aunt was present when she jumped. It is not clear whether she did so as part of an organised trip. The exact cause of death is not known. A local lingo sandwich newspaper is reporting the young woman hit the side of the bridge, causing fatal injuries. Support is being given to the family at this difficult time. And a 12-year-old girl from Hull has died whilst on a school adventure holiday in France. The company which runs the trips says she died following a swimming incident yesterday afternoon - the exact details are not known. The Foreign Office says it is providing assistance to the family. Four Chelsea football fans have been given banning orders for their role in an allegedly racist incident on the Paris Metro. 50-year-old Richard Barklie - a former police officer- has been Banned for five years and josh Parsons has also been given a five-year ban. The case followed an incident earlier this year when a black commuter was was violently pushed off a Paris metro train - followed by racial chanting. Our correspondent Daniela Relph is in Stratford. Thejudge said that The judge said that the incident involving the Chelsea fans in Paris earlier this year had tarnished the reputation of English football in Europe. He was uncompromising in his description of the behaviour of the four Chelsea fans here. He said that night they had been up rent, nasty, arrogant. Their behaviour could not be tolerated in a civilised society. Richard Barclay is a former police officer from Northern Ireland and now director of a human rights organisation. Ajudge said today he was a man whose behaviour at football did not match the picture painted of him away from the game. The mobile phone footage filmed ahead of Chelsea boss Matt Champions League game in Paris in February was described as compelling by the judge. It said it showed Chelsea fans displaying aggressive, disorderly, and at times racist conduct, as a black media tried to board a Metro train. He is pushed off and shouted out while fans make racist and xenophobic chance. 20-year-old josh Parsons was another fan banned for five years today. His behaviour on the night described as agitated, racist, and xenophobic. Two others were also punished. jordan Monday received a three-year ban and William Simpson, filmed earlier in the year with his hood up, now has a five-year ban. He was told by the judge, you can run with the mob but you cannot hide. As well as being banned from watching Chelsea and all other football matches, the four men will also have to hand in their passports during significant international games and tournaments. The four men had all denied being involved in any aggressive or racist behaviour and head of the Champions League game in Paris in February. For most of them, the banning order now means they will not be able to go to a ground and watch a football match until the year 2020. The Church of England will consecrate its third - and most senior- female bishop at Canterbury Cathedral this afternoon. When the Venerable Rachel Treweek becomes the Bishop of Gloucester, she’ll be the first woman to lead a diocese and the first to sit in the House of Lords as a bishop. A fatal accident inquiry has begun into last December’s bin lorry crash in Glasgow in which six people died. The vehicle ran out of control in the city centre three days before Christmas. The inquiry will examine the health of the driver, the design of the lorry and the route it was travelling. Our correspondent, Lorna Gordon, is at the inquiry. This was a horrific crash in one of the busiest parts of Glasgow at one of the busiest times of the year. What is known in Scotland as a fatal accident enquiry got under way in the courts behind me put it will look into the circumstances of the crash. It started with a minute boss Max Islands as -- crash. It started with a minute boss Max Islands as -- a mark of respect those who died. Three days before Christmas, and Glasgow was packed with shoppers buying presents. But at half past two, an out-of-control bin lorry mounted the pavement and careered down a busy thoroughfare before crashing into a hotel. Six people died, three members of the same family, 18-year-old Erin McQuade and her grandparents jack and Lorraine Sweeney as well asjacqueline Morton, Stephanie Tate and Gillian Ewing. The city came together in mourning. Alongside the families of those who were left bereaved. The sheriff leading the enquiry said he could only imagine the shock, pain and anguish they had suffered as a result of their sudden loss. Neither the driver nor the operators of the lorry, Glasgow City Council, will face criminal charges over the crash but this hearing, which may last around four weeks, will examine whether there could have been measures to bring this vehicle to a controlled stop. The route it took on that busy day and the driver’s medical background. The Solicitor General Lesley Thomson is presenting evidence to the court including CCTV footage of the final few distressing seconds of the bin lorry’s journey. Many family members left the room before it was shown. They, though, do want answers as to why this happened and whether anything could have been done to prevent their loved ones’ deaths. Well, the first witnessed the stand about an hour ago. He was one of the binmen who was in the cab the time of this terrible crash. He said the driver, Harry Clarke, had never complained of feeling dizzy or faint, he said it had started out as just another ordinary day but agreed that the events on that damp December afternoon word completely out with his experiences and training. His evidence continues this afternoon and he is expected to talk of the moments of the crash itself. Our top story this lunchtime. New hope in the treatment of Alzheimer’s. Scientists unveil results in the trials of a drug that appear to slow its progress. What may be the world’s oldest fragments of the Koran - have been found in Birmingham. In London, could rail routes of the future, businesses in Surrey want Crossrail two to extend to Guildford. People who operate drones are being warned that they could be prosecuted - and even be sent to prison - if they don’t obey safety rules. The Civil Aviation Authority said a number of drones came close to colliding with passenger planes in recent months. And in the United States, helicopters fighting a forest fire were grounded - because of the number of drones sent into the sky. Our technology correspondent Rory Cellan-jones reports. Patrolling with an on-board camera careers across an estuary in Cumbria before almost clipping a road bridge and ending up in the water. The result was the first prosecution for dangerous drone use and a fine of £800 for the owner. With the technology advancing rapidly and the price of transferring, professionals and amateurs are finding plenty of uses for them and getting amazing shots. Several innovation authority is worried that too many people are breaking the rules. -- is worried that too many people are breaking the rules. -- civil aviation authority. Anyone who wants to make money from flying has to be licensed and failure to follow the rules could lead to criminal prosecution. But today it is sending a message and it is about the code they must follow. The drone code is simple. And at users shouldn’t allow them out of sight, shouldn’t fly above 1+00 feet and shouldn’t go within 50 metres of people or buildings -- within 50 metres of people or buildings -- amateur users. They also warned not to fly near airports. just this week patrolling was in a near miss with an aircraft coming in to land in Warsaw -- drone. And apart reported seeing one flyjust over his wing. Drones are increasing in numbers, we need necessarily see more incidents if people thrive on safely, don’t frighten the airports and air feels well over 1+00 feet. Amateur drone operators working as this week of hampering firefighters dealing with forest fires. Helicopters had to be granted temporarily because so many of the rumoured devices were overhead. But drone makers say most of them now come with technology making it impossible to take off near an airport. And users can still have fun while staying safe. Durham’s Police and Crime Commissioner has been criticised following his revelation that officers in the county will no longer target cannabis users who grow the drug for their own consumption. Ron Hogg says officers will focus on trying to tackle criminal drugs gangs rather than prosecuting people who grow the drug on a small scale. The cultivation of cannabis carries a maximum prison sentence of fourteen years for the most serious producers. Danny Savage is in Durham. ~ -- Gene Kelly is here. How controversial are these comments? The debate around drugs is always highly charged, some people say that you need everything because the current drugs laws aren’t working, others say you had to maintain a hardline intends oral drug use. What Ron Hogg, the police and crime commission that the Durham, is saying that there needs to be a change of attitude and what he says is you have to break the cycle of reoffending when it comes to cannabis use. He wants his forced to change focus. We have to prioritise, we have always had to do that in the police service, we have always had to use our discretion. And we have to focus on those areas that will help us to minimise harm and those are the large-scale producers and the dealers on the streets. We tackle them and then try and help the small-scale users to get away from their habits. So rather than facing prosecution, if you are caught with cannabis in Durham, what will happen is you would be offered the option of going on a programme. What the police and crime commission is saying is that if you don’t take up that option, you could face prosecution. So they are giving people another avenue to go down. Some charities are not happy about this. Addiction UK says it send out the message that drugs are OK. A spokesman pointed out that a lot of people in the country have severe mental health problems which were caused initially by cannabis use. Ron Hogg is stressing that he doesn’t see this scheme as a step towards decriminalisation. The number of suicides in middle-aged men being treated for mental health issues in the UK has risen dramatically in the last 10 years. Experts say the increase could be caused by a combination of alcohol, job worries and debt- but say more research is needed. Here’s our social affairs correspondent, Michael Buchanan. Suicide has long been a bigger problem among men than women. A reluctance to seek help and talk about their problems has made them more prone to acting on suicidal thoughts. Today’s report shows that even those men who have sought support are ending their lives in increasing numbers. The latest figures show there were almost 1+,800 male suicides in 2013. Among those deaths, more than 1,200 were from men known to psychiatric services, a rise of 29% since 2006. Suicide among middle-aged male patients, those aged 1+5-51+, was even more marked. Figures here are up 73% over the same period. Men in middle age seem to be more vulnerable to pressures such as alcohol, economic pressures such as debt, and are more isolated. Many patients who die by suicide live alone. Today’s report also showed that suicide was up among patients forced to leave their local area to find care. Experts said the findings showed once more that psychiatric services are struggling to cope. The official in charge of increasing a smoking ban in prisons in England Wales has said it could be more unsafe places. The new governor says the move could lead to tobacco becoming an illicit currency among inmates. Subsidies for many new solar farms are to end - under plans being published by the government. It says the move is necessary to protect consumers - but the solar industry has criticised the proposals - saying subsidies were one of the cheapest ways that the government could meet its climate change targets. Our Industry Correspondent john Moylan reports. To some, solar farms are a blot on the landscape. To others, they are some of the most cost effective ways of meeting our climate change goals. But these projects are underpinned by subsidies we all paid for through our energy bills and the government says this financial support has been rising too fast. The government remains committed to making sure we are the greenest government ever, but that can’t be a blank cheque so we have to make sure we get that balance. Solar is a great success story and it will continue to be so, throughout all our renewable industry, wind, solar, we have had much more progress than people expected and had an impact on people’s bills so They involve the early closure of a key subsidy, the renewables obligation. There will be changes to rules on how projects qualify for subsidies. The industry says this will deter investment. Some have questioned the government’s commitment to green energy. Last month it said support for onshore wind farms would also end. The solar industry has said these plans would be damaging to an industry that employs 35,000 people and which could soon stand on its own feet. We’re tantalisingly close now to not needing support. We have produced our costs by 70% in the last four years. We need that supported take as to the stage where we don’t need any government support anymore, when any goVâI’I’IITIâI’Il SUppoIât 8I’IyITIOI’â, Wi’IâI’I WE any government support anymore, when we would be the first energy sector in the UK to not need it. The renewables industry warns that it will hit the take-up of green energy and the growth of greenjobs. The government will be hoping this move will prove popular and will ease the pressure on our energy bills. What may be the world’s oldest surviving text from the Koran has been found by the University of Birmingham. The manuscript had gone unnoticed in the university’s library for almost a century - but after it was spotted by a researcher, carbon-dating tests show that it is at least 1,370 years old, making it one of the earliest in existence and around, possibly, when the prophet Mohammed lived, as our education correspondent Sean Coughlan You’re looking at one of the oldest fragments of the Koran ever discovered. It is written in early Arabic, on parchment, most likely made from sheep or goatskin and dated by experts as being more than 1370 years old. That makes it among the earliest known fragments of the Koran anywhere in the world and it is here in the University of Birmingham. This remarkable document had been resting on the shelves of the university library for decades without anyone realising just how old it was, until a researcher decided to take a closer look. The manuscript had been stored here in a collection of Middle Eastern documents brought to Birmingham in the 1920s. The pages were radio-carbon dated to no later than the year 61+5, We were expecting it to be early, but we did not, in our wildest dreams, expect it would roughly correlate to the lifespan of the Prophet Muhammad, which makes it an incredibly early Koranic fragment. Academics say this discovery goes back to the earliest years of Islam. The person who actually wrote it might well have known the Prophet Muhammad. He would have seen him, probably.

Birmingham has one of the country’s biggest Muslim communities and a local leader has welcomed having such a treasure in their city. When I saw these pages, I was very much moved. There were tears ofjoy and emotions in my eyes. And I’m quite sure that young people from all over the UK will come here to Birmingham tojust have a glimpse of these pages. People will love this. This is an exceptionally rare and valuable discovery and the university says it will be put on public display. It has no intention of letting these pages from world history leave Birmingham. Time for a look at the weather. A double rainbow on this weather picture! Another day of sunshine and showers, I’m afraid, but compared to yesterday, the showers are more widespread and will be heavier as well. A lump of cloud spiralling around and around, like water going down a plughole. That is responsible for bringing us the showers today, you can see this lump of cloud pushing eastwards, taking the showers towards the eastern side of England where the weather will tend to cloud over. For Northern Ireland and Scotland we will continue to see the showers fed in on the risk winds. Should be more in the way of sunshine later, the showers will turn heavy over the Midlands and parts of Lincolnshire. The Northern Ireland and Scotland, the showers not lasting long in any one place. Temperatures below par for the time of year. Overnight, we will see further showers feeding in across Scotland, otherwise the weather should become dry with clear skies and a fresh night for most, temperatures between ten and 13 degrees. ForThursday, further showers, the area of low pressure spending close to the north of Scotland, which will see the lion share of the downpours. A few showers moving into Northern Ireland but you showers for England and Wales. In the Sun Tran, feeling reasonable out in the breeze, still a little bit call across the northern part of the UK. -- in the sunshine. The low pressure pushes off into Norway, another area of low pressure bringing outbreaks of rain to Southern counties but there is a bit of uncertainty about how far north this band of rain will get.

Tony Blair has given a stark warning to Labour that it’s unlikely to win power again if it moves further to the left of British politics. In a rare intervention, the former prime minister said the party - which will elect a new leader in the next few weeks - is in danger of re-discovering how to lose. There are four candidates standing forthe party leadership; Mr Blair’s speech comes amid growing momentum behind the left winger, jeremy Corbyn - as our political correspondent Ben Wright reports. And later it in half, but it has also chosen election losers. Quite a few of them. It is not as back then. But not him. Tony Blair in late 33 election victories and as the party takes a new leader, he has this week. Does move back. If we do, the public will not vote for us. Not because our thoughts are too pure, but because powerful and out of touch. By moving back delays left, as it did after Mrs Thatcher won in 1979. He rarely steps in these days but with a left-wing MP, jeremy Corbyn, seeming to surge, the comments have died and his audience approved. We’re not going to win by moving left, by thinking the public are wrong. Shifting to the left has not worked. Across London a different view. Being denounced by Tony Blair at the disappointment that will not damagejeremy. jeremy Corbyn has been a fairly lonely figure. This contest has now become interesting. An MP since 1983, he was close to Tony Benn, new Labour he was not. He has long campaigned against nuclear weapons, the monarchy and an end to austerity. Do you think this left-wing platform holds the answers to Labour’s problems. All this know somebody who needs help, health care. We need an inclusive society. Some MPs nominated jeremy Corbyn to get him into the contest even though they never wanted him to win. They are watching his rise with alarm. I was concerned that people would feel they had been deprived of the opportunity for their point of view to be aired. Yes, I’m beginning to wish I hadn’t. I will be quite honest about it. Within a few week this is rebellious outsider is suddenly centre stage. Potentially Labour’s next leader. Ben is at Westminster this evening. As you reflected, Ben, Tony Blair doesn’t really intervene terribly often in this way. How significant do you think his comments are? Politicians in Westminster call him ""the master"", people around David Cameron and George Osborne who have admired his sense of positioning, his tactics and flare. Labour has a more complicated relationship with their most recent successful leader, not least because of Iraq. Ed Miliband declared the era of New Labour is dead. The party is at a crossroads. jeremy Corbyn is doing well. He has momentum. The other candidates have not grabbed this contest as their own yet. There is a complicated voting system at play here. It’s too early to predict what will happen by September. As I said, the Labour Party, the reason this is anguished is that it’s a massive moment of choice. It was wiped out by the left-wing SNP in Scotland. Ukip nibbled into its vote in England, the Tories are squeezing it out everywhere. Will Tony Blair galvanise support around jeremy Corbyn orjolt Labour into picking someone else? Ben, thank you. Ben Wright. Researchers in the United States say they’ve had encouraging results from a trial of a drug to treat Alzheimer’s disease. Interim test results suggest the new drug can slow progress of the disease, if it’s taken in the early stages. The findings need to be confirmed by a separate trial next year, as our Medical Correspondent Fergus Walsh reports. Alzheimer’s has devastated consequences. Contrast the healthy brain on the right with another ravished by the disease. The brain chinks, tissue dies, memory and cognitive function decline. Alzheimer’s disease is gradually robbing Roz of her independence and ability to communicate. It means she relies increasingly on her husband, jeremy. You stop thinking and you 9ÂÂ jeremy. You stop thinking and you go, can’t remember what I’m doing. You know, this sort of thing. It’s just... I’m not very... Terrible really. It’s rather terrible. You feel. I mean, Ithink, the awful thing is that it makes you feel useless. In past 30 years there have been more than 100 failed Alzheimer’s trials. There are a few medicine that is can ease symptoms, but nothing halts the disease. Now, preliminary results, released at a conference, suggest a drug may delay cognitive decline in patients in the earliest stages of Alzheimer’s. These findings are hugely significant in the sense that it’s the first data that we’ve had which is consistent with a drug actually slowing down the course of the disease. I’m very excited by these findings because I think we could be on the verge of a radical breakthrough for therapy for people with Alzheimer’s disease. There are half a million people in the UK with Alzheimer’s disease the most common form ever dementia. It’s partly triggered by Amyloids. This can start a decade before symptoms of die men sha show. As they stick together in clumps, they block the connections between neurons, causing them to die. The drug mops up the faulty proteins before they form plaques, so preserving brain function. Oh, H... Ican’t. It’s not available to those like Roz outside the clinical trial. It will come too late to help her. The idea of ending UP late to help her. The idea of ending up with no memory in a care home, being spoon fed baby food Oh, come on. Is intolerable. I don’t think she will take that, actually. I’m all right now. You’re all right now. Patients have waited decades for an Alzheimer’s drug. We can’t be sure it works until another trial reports at the end of next year. Fergus is with me. That is the key point we still have much more data to wait for, don’t we? We do. In no other field of medicine, be it cancer or heart disease, would we get so excited about such interim data. There are plenty of breakthroughs in those other fields. There are plenty of breakthroughs in those otherfields. In those other fields. In Alzheimer’s we don’t have one drug that slows or halts the progression of the disease. The findings are tentative. Their share prize has rocketed on the back of this. We won’t know for at least a year whether it’s the breakthrough that patients and scientists have been waiting for. All right thank you. Fergus, Walsh. A 12 year old girl from Hull has died during a school adventure holiday in France. She was involved yesterday in what’s been described She was involved yesterday in what’s been described as an accident on a lake, at an activity centre in Liginiac in central France. She died this morning in hospital in Limoges. Our Correspondent Ed Thomas is at Wolfreton School. What do we know? We have been learning more of what we think may have happened to this 12-year-old in France. We understand she was playing with other pupils when they fell into the lake in this water park. The children we are told became trapped and had to be rescued and pulled out by lifeguards. This 12-year-old girl was resuscitated at the scene and airlifted to hospital where she sadly later died. The head teacher of this school came down here earlier. She was shaken and spoke of his sadness. The parents and sister of the student involved are now in France and our heartfelt thoughts and prayers go to the family at this very difficult time. As a parent myself, I can only begin to imagine the pain felt by her parents and family at her death at such a young age. As you would expect the news of this terrible tragedy has come as a dreadful shock to our whole school community. There will now be a criminal investigation in France to find out what happened. Prosecutors will work with French police to find out if there was any negligence, if anything more could have been done to save this young girl’s life while the council here said it too will investigate. It will also work with the school to bring these young pupils and the teachers home as soon as possible. Thank you, Ed, Ed Thomas. A British woman has died while bungee jumping from a bridge near Granada in Spain. Klyo De Abreu, who was 23, was killed close to the mountain village of Lanharron. Police say they’re investigating whether her death was caused by a ‘miscalculation’ with the rope. One of the workmen travelling in the bin lorry that crashed in Glasgow last December, killing six people, has been describing his frantic efforts to wake up the driver. Matthew Telford told an inquiry about his panic, when he realised that Harry Clarke was slumped unconscious at the wheel. He said he hit Mr Clarke on the back, and screamed ""you’re killing people, Harry."" Our Scotland Correspondent Lorna Gordon reports. Three days before Christmas and a bin lorry ran out of control in one of the busiest parts of Glasgow at one of the busiest times of the year. It careered down a busy street before crashing into a hotel, hitting more than a dozen people on itsjourney. 18-year-old Erin its journey. 18-year-old Erin McQuade itsjourney. 18-year-old Erin McQuade and her grandparents jack and Lorraine Sweeney, so were jacqueline Morton, Stephenie Tait and Gillian Ewing. None of them made it home. The inquiry into their deaths was shown CCTV footage of the final few distressing seconds of the vehicle’sjourney. The bereaved vehicle’s journey. The bereaved families vehicle’sjourney. The bereaved families left the court before it was shown. The bin lorry veered to the left towards the bottom end of this street as it continues up the road it mounts the pavement, people are seen scattering to get out of its way. Some pedestrians crossing its path, passers-by coming to the aid of those who had been knocked down. Matthew Telford was one of the lorry’s crew and the first to give evidence. He said that when the driver, Harry Clarke, slumped over the wheel of the vehicle panic set in. He started screaming at the driver, punching him on the back to try to get a response. He then shouted, ""you’re killing people, Harry."" There was no reaction. Mr Telford said, ""I wasjust hoping it would hit something and stop."" The families of those who died have been waiting seven months for this inquiry to start to hear the details of that December afternoon. I think this is a very difficult day for them, but what they’re looking for, in this inquiry, is a full and robust investigation into all the circumstances that led to this terrible accident. This inquiry is not about apportioning blame, neither the driver nor the City Council, which operated the lorry, will face criminal charges. The families of those who died and the city, which grieved with them, want to know why this horrific crash happened and whether it could have been prevented. The fatal accident inquiry will focus on three broad areas, the route that the vehicle took, whether any measures could been taken to bring it to a stop and driver’s medical record. He is said to have no recollection of the crash but he will be giving evidence during this inquiry which is set to last more than a month. Four Chelsea football fans, including a former police officer, have been banned from attending football matches for up to five years for their involvement in an apparently racist incident on the Paris underground. Video footage, recorded in February, showed a black commuter being repeatedly pushed off a carriage, amid racist chanting. The judge today said the men’s behaviour was ""nasty, offensive and utterly unacceptable."" Daniela Relph was at Stratford Magistrates Court. There had been tension and disorder for much of the day. There had been drinking and drug-taking amongst the fans. It was an incident on the Paris Metro that the judge described as having tarnished the reputation of English football. Chelsea fans blocked this man’s path and pushed him off the train. He tried again, but got the same reaction, amid deeply offensive chance. -- but got the same reaction, amid deeply offensive chance. -- chants.

And William Simpson, who the judge warned could not hide behind the mob. As he left court, William Simpson was asked about his behaviour that night. He said nothing.

Durham’s Police and Crime Commissioner has been defending the decision that officers in the county will no longer target cannabis users who grow the drug for their own consumption. Ron Hogg says officers will focus on tackling drugs gangs and dealers, rather than prosecuting people who grow the drug on a small scale. Danny Savage reports. The 51-year-old who grew this was giving a caution and not prosecuted. Large-scale growers will still be prosecuted but the police and crime commission has confirmed that small-scale cannabis growers will have their plants seized but are unlikely to be taken to court. Are you going soft on drugs? Absolutely not. We tackle organised crime gangs very vigorously. The message coming across is that cannabis is OK. It is not OK. It causes harm. We want to reduce harm, to minimise harm. He used to be a senior police officer and says he is speaking from experience. Growing cannabis is illegal and Durham Police is not ignoring the low but it is using its discretion on how far to take individual cases. One person said, it is a monumental step in the right direction. ~ I started smoking when I was about 11+. I was doing it to fit in with the big boys. Then the next drug comes along. This recovering addict agrees with the last sentiment. He was expelled from school, bedtime in prison and ruined his life after getting in with friends who grew cannabis. It is a really bad idea because it gives people incentive to grow it or smoke it. I think it is a bad idea. It is not sending a good message to younger people. I think anyone should be prosecuted. Others believe there is more relaxed attitude to small-time cannabis cultivators will cause increased problems in society. We are concerned that the impression may be given that smoking cannabis is a good thing. Clearly we are seeing more evidence of people with mental health problems and psychosis and smoking cannabis over a long period of time can be extremely damaging. High-tech methods such as heat-seeking cameras to find cannabis farms will still be used. Police say the long-term abuse -- solution is to get treatment for addicts rather than punish them. The Church of England’s most senior female bishop has been consecrated in a ceremony at Canterbury Cathedral. Rachel Treweek, who is the new Bishop of Gloucester, is the first woman to lead a diocese and will be the first female bishop to sit in the House of Lords. The Canterbury Cathedral Girls’ Choir- which formed only last year - led the singing at the service. The growing number of people who fly drones are being warned that they could be prosecuted, if they fail to obey safety rules. The Civil Aviation Authority has issued a ‘drone code’ for the use of the small remotely-controlled aircraft after recent incidents involving drones coming close to passenger planes. Our technology correspondent, Rory Cellan-jones, is in West London for us. The makers of these particular drones sea they come with a safety code in the box and technology that stops them taking off near an airport, but thousands of them are being sold every week. The Civil Aviation Authority is concerned that many of them are not learning how to fly safely. There are flashing images in this report. Amazing technology which allows anyone to film images that once had to be shot from a helicopter. No wonder drones are becoming so popular. But dangers await. Last year at this one slipped a bridge in Cumbria, minding its own or with an £800 fine. But remain injuries when a drone went out of control in the United States, flying into a stadium. A pilot approaching Heathrow last year reported that a drone flew right over his wing. Sell your to follow the rules... The Civil Aviation Authority wants amateurs to wake up to the dangers. The potential use for them is huge. We need not necessarily see more incidents if people use their common sense and do not fly them over 1+00 feet. Amateur users have to keep drones within sight and must not fly them above 1+00 feet or within 50 metres of buildings and people. james is a radio presenter in Suffolk and has become a drone enthusiast. He has had training and is CAA approved. He thinks not everyone is aware of the risks. Many who date as a serious hobby will undertake formal training until they achieves certification. You can take them straight out of the box without any training. So far there has not been a serious accident with a drone. Lots of people are getting huge enjoyment from them. The message to this new breed of pilots is think before you fly. What may be the oldest fragments of the Koran in existence have been discovered in the archives of Birmingham University. The fragments have been radiocarbon-dated to within a few years of the death of the Prophet Mohammed. Nick Higham reports. It isjust a fragment, but it is written using an early form of script in the words of the Koran. It has been carbon dated to the year 61+5 at the latest. It could be even older. The Prophet Mohammed died in 632. If the dating is correct then the person who wrote it may well have known the Prophet Mohammed. He would have seen him probably. He would maybe have heard him preach. He may have known him personally. That is quite a thought to conjure with. Muslims believe the Koran was dictated by Muhammad and then memorised and written down on changed by his followers. Some Western academics think it must have evolved over many years like the Christian Bible. This is significant because it suggests the traditional Muslim account might be correct. The text may have been settled during the Prophet’s own lifetime. For Birmingham’s Muslim community it is a remarkable and emotional discovery. When I saw these pages I was very moved. There were tears of iw was very moved. There were tears of joy and emotions in my ice. We never thought that we would have such an old copy of our holy book. As a news story it is very good because Muslims are constantly in the headlines for the wrong reasons. The fact that they have validation is important for their identity, and it gives pride to the Muslim community.

Their work here is regarded as the Sistine Chapel of the UK. It is now being replicated in London’s largest painting by numbers. Welcome to BBC London News with me, Riz Lateef. Police are trying to find an armed robber who’s on the run after being mistakenly released from jail. Ryan Byrne has a conviction for robbery but was freed from Wandsworth prison last Friday. Since then he’s posted pictures of himself on social media - and in one he’s seen grinning next to a police van. As Emma North reports, this isn’t the first embarrassment for the prison involved. Ryan Byrne should be in prison but it looks like he’s been enjoying bars of an altogether different kind. He posted this picture on the internet to showjust how sweet freedom can be. So who is he? He’s 31+ years old, five feet 11 and thought to be from Hammersmith. He was serving nine years for burglary, robbery and theft. But he was set free last Friday. He had been released by mistake. One former inmate of Wandsworth says he is not surprised. People would not be let out for visits when their families have travelled half of the country to see them because of error. People would not be released on the due date because of error. The prison service say that Ryan Byrne’s disappearance will be investigated but that his recapture is a matter for the police. They say that so-called releases on error are rare but they are regrettable. It’s not the first time in the past year at least that Wandsworth prison has been the scene of some rather unusual security breaches. One prisoner set up a fake e-mail account in his cell. He posed as a court clerk and convinced prison staff that he should be let free. And earlier this year a judge ordered an investigation into security at Wandsworth after another prisoner organised eight machine guns to be smuggled into the UK using a mobile phone. The number of officers at Wandsworth has been reduced in recent years from 1+20 to 270. At the last count there were 1600 inmates in a jail designed for 950. You are asking staff to deal with a lot of complicated men who do not want to be there. People are dying. The suicide rate is not acceptable. We have got to act radically. There are ",,

Researchers in the United States say they have had encouraging results from a trial of a drug for Alzheimer’s. Interim test results suggest the new drug can slow progress of the disease if it is taken in the early stages. Some 44 million people suffer from dementia worldwide, with Alzheimer’s the most common cause. That number could grow to 135 million by the middle of the century. As our medical correspondent Fergus Walsh reports, these initial findings still need to be confirmed by a separate trial next year. Alzheimer’s has devastating consequences. Contrast the healthy brain on the right, with another, ravaged by the disease. The brain shrinks, tissue dies, memory and cognitive function decline. What we could do in September is go to Greece, now that the banks are working again. Greece... Alzheimer’s disease is gradually robbing Ros Underwood of her independence and ability to communicate. It means she relies increasingly on her husband Jeremy. I think I have to take things. Do you...? Shall I do it? Yeah. Go on then. I will do it. Ros’s short-term memory is completely intact. However, she has a communication problem which is unusual insofar as, she knows the word she wants to speak. She cannot speak it but she can write it down. You stop thinking and you go, I cannot remember what I am doing. This sort of thing. It’s, erm... I’m not very...terrible, really. It is rather terrible. In the past 30 years, there have been more than 100 failed Alzheimer’s trials. There are a few medicines which can ease symptoms, but nothing halts the disease. Now, preliminary results released at a conference suggest a drug called Solanezumab may delay cognitive decline in patients in the earliest stages of Alzheimer’s. These findings are hugely significant in the sense that it is the first data that we have had which is consistent with a drug actually slowing down the course of the disease. I am very excited by these findings as I think we could be on the verge of a radical breakthrough for therapy for people with Alzheimer’s disease. There are around half a million people in the UK with Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia. Its onset is partly triggered by the build-up of rogue proteins called amyloids around neurons in the brain. This can start a decade before symptoms of dementia show. As they stick together in clumps known as plaques, they block the connections between neurons, causing them to die. Solanezumab appears to mop up some of these faulty proteins before they start to form plaques, so preserving brain function. No, not Italy... For Roz, finding the right word is a constant struggle. 0h, H... Ican’t. But news of the drug trial has given her and her husband a boost. We hope, yes, we do hope. Really... This is in the last week, so, it is fantastic, if it works. We cannot be sure what effect it would have on Roz at the moment, but we would like to get our hands on it! Yes! But a note of caution - we will not know whether Solanezumab really does slow Alzheimer’s until the results of another trial late next year. And it would take considerably longer to become a standard treatment. It is important to stress that this is very early days with this drug, and there’s still a lot more testing to be done. Yes, we cannot call this a breakthrough, at least, not yet. In breakthrough, at least, not yet. In no other field of medicine would no other field of medicine would there be such excitement, such there be such excitement, such attention, on interim results. That attention, on interim results. That is because in other disease areas, is because in other disease areas, breakthroughs are plentiful. But breakthroughs are plentiful. But with Alzheimer’s, there is nothing with Alzheimer’s, there is nothing which slows the progression of this which slows the progression of this devastating condition. This drug devastating condition. This this looks devastating condition. This drug looks promising, but I cannot tell looks promising, but I cannot tell you tonight by how many months it you tonight by how many months it would delay the onset of the disease would delay the onset of the disease if a patient was to take it.

But it is going to be at least a year before we know whether least a year before we know whether this dmg IS the least a year before we know whether this drug IS the breakthrough which this this IS the breakthrough which patients and this drug IS the breakthrough which patients and scientists have been patients and scientists have been hoping for.

A woman from London has died while bungee jumping from a bridge near Granada in Spain. Klayo De Abreu, who was 23, was killed close to the mountain village of Lanjaron. Police say they are investigating whether her death was caused by a ""miscalculation"" with the rope. One of the crew travelling in the bin lorry that crashed in Glasgow last December, killing six people, has been describing his frantic efforts to revive the driver. At the inquiry into the accident, Matthew Telford told of his panic when he realised that Harry Clarke was slumped unconscious at the wheel. He said he hit Mr Clarke on the back and screamed ""you’re killing people, Harry."" Four Chelsea football fans, including a former police officer, have been banned from attending football matches for up to five years for their involvement in a racist incident on the Paris underground. Video footage, recorded in February, showed a black commuter, being repeatedly pushed off a carriage, amid racist chanting. The judge today said the men’s behaviour was ""nasty, offensive and utterly unacceptable. "" Daniela Relph was at Stratford Magistrates Court. Her report contains some flashing images from the start. CHANTING. Paris in February of this year. Chelsea fans in the city ahead of their Champions League game. There’d been tension and disorder for much of the day. Police reported heavy drinking and drug taking amongst fans. But it was an incident on the Paris Metro that a judge described today as having tarnished the reputation of English football in Europe. Souleymane Sylla, on his way home from work, tried to get onto a Metro carriage. Chelsea fans blocked his path and pushed him off the train. He tried again, but got the same reaction amid deeply offensive chants. We’re racist, we’re racist... Today, four of those involved were punished. Richard Barklie, 50 years old, a former police officer, now working in human rights. Banned for five years for aggressive conduct. Next to him, 20-year-old joshua Parsons, who’s behaviour that night was described as agitated and threatening. Also banned for five years. Behind him, Jordan Munday, he got a three year ban for contributing to unacceptable behaviour. And, William Simpson, anotherfive year ban. Thejudge warned him he could not hide behind the mob. REPORTER: You’re accused of being a thug. Are you a thug, Mr Simpson? As he left court today, William Simpson was asked about his behaviour that night, he said nothing. The judge told the court that the use of CCTV and phone footage meant unacceptable behaviour was now less easy to hide in the crowd. He said the conduct of the four Chelsea fans that evening in Paris was ""nasty, arrogant and abhorrent and could not be tolerated in a civilised society."" At home in Paris, Souleymane Sylla says the experience has been hard to forget. TRANSLATION: I’m waiting for compensation for myself and for my family. We’ve all been so traumatised by this. Thejudge said that despite much good work, football still has a racism problem and this case had highlighted that. Daniela Relph, BBC News, Stratford. Over the past few months, militants of the self-styled Islamic State have posted horrific online images of themselves killing men for being gay, by throwing them from high buildings. So far this year, they’ve documented the murders of 26 men they’ve labelled as homosexual, although activists say the true figure of those killed could be much higher. Caroline Hawley went to meet a friend of one of the murdered men, who had a narrow escape himself. We’re not identifying him and his words are spoken by an actor. You may find some of the images distressing. Tayem is only alive because it wasn’t he who answered the door when Isis came looking for him. We came to meet the young Iraqi in Lebanon, where he’s safe at last. But earlier this year, Isis killed one of his closest friends. Tayem found out after Isis posted photographs online of the 22-year-old, who’d tried to keep his sexuality secret. The images show him about to be thrown from a building. Then, on the ground, with another man murdered the same way. Tayem heard from a friend that the fall didn’t kill him, so he’d been stoned to death. TRANSLATION: He was a great man, really kind, really calm, really smart. He had straight As all the time. One day he was alive, active, just living his life. And now he’s gone. The first time I saw the pictures, I really wanted to break down. And what’s really disturbing is that people actually support |sis for doing this. Sometimes I have nightmares of being thrown off a building or getting arrested by Isis or facing the same fate as my friend. Tayem runs to try to escape those nightmares. But last summer he says he was running for his life. A friend had inadvertently outed him to an extremist who’d joined Isis. A month after taking over his town, they were knocking at his door. My dad answered the door, and they said to him, ""Your son is ""an infidel and a homosexual. ""And we have come to apply God’s punishment on him."" MY My dad is a religious man. Luckily for me, my dad told them to come back the next day, after HE was sure that the accusation was correct. Then he came inside the house and started screaming. And finally, he said, ""if these actions accusations are true, | will hand you over to them myself, happily.‘ And Ijust stood there, not knowing what to do or how to defend myself. But my mother decided that I should leave the house immediately, and she worked on getting me out of Iraq for good. It was difficult and often dangerous if you were known to be gay before IS came wasn’t it - how much worse did it become? Isis is tracking down gay men one by one. The previous militias in Iraq used to rape and blackmail gay people and kill them in horrible ways. But they weren’t as professional at tracking people down. Now, if one gay man is arrested, Isis will go through all their contacts. They’re targeting every gay man. And Tayem says he knows dozens of gay men who cannot leave, now living with a death sentence if they’re found out. who knows who is next? l was lucky to get out. I saved my soul. But what about them? Are will they be lucky enough to survive and if they survive will survive and if they survive will they cope with the trauma of being they cope with the trauma of being hunted? Caroline Hawley reporting there from Lebanon. A brief look at some of the day’s other news stories. The Church of England has consecrated its third and most senior female bishop at Canterbury Cathedral. Rachel Treweek, who’s a former speech therapist, has become the Bishop of Gloucester, the first woman to lead a diocese and sit as a peer in the House of Lords. A mother and daughter have lost their appeal against a ruling that women from Northern Ireland are not entitled to free abortion on the NHS in England. The teenage girl, who was 15 when she made the journey in 2012, had to pay for a private termination of her pregnancy. People who use drones have been warned that they could be prosecuted and even face prison if they do not obey a new safety code. The Civil Aviation Authority said a number of drones have come close to colliding with passenger planes in recent months. It’s claimed to be saving the Government hundreds of millions of pounds and changing the way officials communicate with taxpayers and consumers. Pioneered by the Behavioural Insights Team - which is part funded by the Government - so-called 'nudging’ uses psychology to work out the best way to help Jobcentres, tax collectors, health officials and others improve the way they deliver public services. Our home editor, Mark Easton, has had exclusive access to the latest results. Politicians spend a lot of time trying to change the way we behave, passing laws, banning stuff, using tax and welfare to encourage us to do what they want. But for the last five years the British Government has been using another way and you may have been affected without even realising it. They’ve been nudging you. Here’s an example. How do you get rich people to pay tax they owe? Send a standard letter threatening legal action and among the richest 1%, four out of ten quickly settle their debt to the taxman. Send them a letter pointing out their taxes improve local services and the number rises to almost half. But if the letter says without their tax some local services might disappear, the figure jumps again to 56%. This tiny change in the wording saw £210 million in overdue tax paid to the Treasury. The Behavioural Insights Team began life in Downing Street, coming up with clever nudges for ministers. Two years ago, it became a social purpose company, selling its ideas to governments around the world. Some people think this is all a bit sinister, government kind of getting into their heads and changing their behaviour. Well, certainly, in the early days, in 2010, people were pretty sceptical about it. But as the results have come through are in quite practical ways, often people’s reaction is a rather different one, which is - this is really great. This is common sense, almost. Why don’t we do it more often? How do you get more unemployed people to turn up forjob interviews? The nudge unit tried a simple text telling claimants about an interview, just 11% turned up. But when they added the claimant’s first name, the figure rose to 15%. when theJobcentre adviser signed it, the number rose again. However, when the adviser wished the claimant ""good luck"", the proportion turning up rose to 27%. The personal touch was so successful it’s now used in everyjobcentre in the country. Richard Thaler describes himself as the Godfather of Britain’s nudge unit. His books on behavioural economics have been read by numerous politicians including Barack Obama, Tony Blair and David Cameron. The team helped speed up tax payments just by rewriting a letter. That’s just money coming in to Treasury faster than it otherwise would and paid for the team in and of itself. So we can do stuff. will we solve every problem? No. Can we solve climate change over night? No. Can we help a little? Yes. The nudge team was asked to help increase the number of black and minority ethnic people applying to become police officers. One big hurdle was an online test. 60% of white applicants successfully completed it, but only 40% of BME. So the recruitment letter was changed asking, what is it about being a Police Constable that means the most to you and your community? The white pass rate didn’t change, but the BME rose to match it. Whether it be encouraging healthier lifestyles, saving fora pension or taking your litter home, nudging can work. If you don’t trust government, you won’t trust its nudges, but politicians have found a new way to make us behave. Mark Easton, BBC News. What may be the oldest fragments in existence of the Koran have been discovered in the archives of Birmingham University. The pieces have been radiocarbon dated to within a few years of the death of the Prophet Mohammed. Nick Higham reports. It’s just a fragment, but it’s written using an early form of Arabic script and the words are from the Koran. They’re written on sheep or goat skin parchment and that parchment’s been radiocarbon dated to the year 645, at the latest. It could be even older. The Prophet Mohammed died in 632. If the dating of our Koran is correct, then the person who actually wrote it may well have known the Prophet Mohammed. He would have seen him, probably. He would maybe have heard him preach in Medina. He may have known him personally and that really is quite a thought to conjure with. Muslims believe the Koran was dictated by Mohammed and then memorised and written down, unchanged, by his immediate followers, but some western academics think it must have evolved over many years, like the Christian Bible and theJewish Torah. This discovery is significant because it suggests the traditional Muslim account might in fact be correct, the text may indeed have been settled during the prophet’s own lifetime. For Birmingham’s Muslim community, one of the largest in the country, it’s a remarkable and emotional discovery. Myself, when I saw these pages, l was very much moved. There were tears ofjoy and emotions in my eyes because we never thought that we would have such an old copy of our holy book. For Muslims generally, the discovery’s a shot in the arm. I think, as a news story, it’s very good because Muslims are constantly in the headlines for the wrong reasons. The fact that they have some kind of validation for their religious tradition. The history of that tradition is important for themselves, in terms of self identity, and also it gives pride to the Muslim community as well that they have something they can reflect upon and perhaps talk to people about. And it’s in Birmingham thanks to a member of the wealthy Cadbury family in the city who bank rolled a collector of ancient manuscripts in the 19205. Nick Higham, BBC News. That’s all from us.

Good evening. The families of the two British men, killed when their car crashed in the Austrian mountains, have been speaking about their loss. josh Robinson and Danny Hall, who were both in their 20s, died when their vehicle left the road yesterday and plunged more than 1300 hundred feet. Police say they were taking part in a rally across Europe. Sarah Campbell reports. 75 horsepower, foot to the floor. For two young men who loved cars, this would have been a dream holiday. Driving some of Europe’s most spectacular and challenging roads in a rally spanning eight countries in seven days. Day six on the Great European Rally. 25-year-old Danny Hall and 22-year-old josh Robinson posted regular updates on social media. This was filmed two days before they were killed. josh was planning to audition to be a Top Gear presenter. This shows the road over Grosslockner, Austria’s highest mountain. It is closed for six months of the year and is famed for its hairpin bends and sheer drops. Two days before, josh had posted on Facebook that a motorbike rider had died. And you can imagine, as a father I was like, ""Be careful, don’t be silly, don’t do anything."" josh’s car was found yesterday morning. It had fallen 1300 feet. Austrian police believe the men were thrown from the car as it hit a crash barrier on the High Alpine Road. The exact circumstances of the crash are not yet known. They were two outgoing, happy lads. Fantastic lads. I am very proud to have known Danny and I’m so proud to have been josh’s father. The two man had grown up together and cars were their passion. Both of their families are trying to come to terms with their loss. Danny couldn’t wait. For the whole week leading up to it he was just so excited. just so excited. He had saying, ""Loving life"". Most of his mates will remember him for saying ""Loving life"", and that’s all he could say all week. We’re on our way... Both men knew these were potentially dangerous roads. Austrian police are investigating what went so tragically wrong. Sarah Campbell, BBC News. On his first visit to Kenya since becoming US President, Barack Obama has praised the country’s democracy and fight against terrorism, but he also urged its leaders to tackle corruption and improve rights for gay people. The Kenyan president, Uhuru Kenyatta, thanked Mr Obama for his support but said that while the two countries share many values, gay rights are a ""non issue"" for Kenyan people. From Nairobi, Alastair Leithead reports. It’s no exaggeration to say they were dancing in the street over President Obama’s so-called home coming. These Masai weren’t even part of the official welcoming party. Security around this visit has been unlike anything Nairobi has seen or heard, but then an American president’s never been here before. The usually congested streets are closed and the military was on high alert for the president’s first engagement. CHEERING It is wonderful to be back in Kenya. A bit of Swahili slang to endear him to the audience, if that was even necessary. This looks like biofuel. He came to meet entrepreneurs. His message is that business, trade and invention is the way for Africa to lift itself out of poverty. He paid his respects at the site where the US embassy was destroyed by a bomb in 1998, when more than 200 people died and America’s War on Terror first began. Visiting the memorial is a reminder of how important security cooperation is between these two countries and indeed, to this visit. As President Obama makes his way to the state house, it will be at the core of the discussions between the two leaders. They agreed on that and many things. But went different directions on others. Deals were signed and there was plenty of tough talking. Ladies and gentleman, the presidents... Even when they addressed the nation after their meeting. With respect, the rights of gays and lesbians, I believe in the principle of treating people equally under the law. For Kenyans today, theissue under the law. For Kenyans today, the issue of gay rights is really a nonissue. They agrowed to disagrow. President Obama pushed on the importance of hum an rights and good governance. With respect to corruption, this may be the biggest impediment to Kenya growing even faster. Conversations that continued over a formal dinner at state house. Tomorrow President Obama meets university students and addressing the nation that claims him as their own. Drivers trying to reach France through the Channel Tunnel have again faced serious disruption. Eurotunnel had to suspend services for a time overnight, after reports that migrants were trying to break into trains in Calais. That led to delays of up to four hours this morning, though the situation eased later in the day. We’ve been up since 3. 1+5am. Really tired at the moment. We don’t know what’s happening. We haven’t got a clue what’s happening. It looks like we might have to abandon our holiday and go home. We’ve not got any information. We can’t get an internet signal to see what’s happening. Yeah, not looking good. Kurdish separatists have accused Turkey of unilaterally ending their ceasefire, by attacking training camps used by the militants in northern Iraq. The airstrikes and artillery shelling coincided with a second wave of bombing against so-called Islamic State extremists, in neighouring Syria - a campaign Turkey had previously been reluctant to join. Mark Lowen reports from Istanbul. From the skies above Syria, Turkish jets strike. A once reluctant observer, now on the frontline of military action against IS. Turkey has sent F-16jets into action and will allow its bases to be used for air strikes. But it seems a condition is that curdish separatists, the PKK in northern Iraq, will be hit in a two pronged attack. TRANSLATION: Unfortunately, Turkey is TRANSLATION: Unfortunately, Turkey is surrounded by a ring of fire. In such an atmosphere Turkey tries to keep democracy and development alive. No-one should expect Turkey to stand still against these elements threatening its national security. So Turkey has taken on enemies on both fronts. In return for bombing IS in northern Syria, Turkey says coalition jets will patrol a safe zone near the Turkish border. Meanwhile the PKK has been targeted in Iraq, hitting warehouses and shelters, the first strikes against the group since the ceasefire came into force in 2013 with potentially serious consequences. These attacks have unilaterally ended the two-and-a-half year non-conflict and ceasefire situation. The ceasefire no longer has any significance. On the ground in Turkey a wave of arrests of suspected IS and PKK members, almost 600 now rounded up. The Turkish government says more will follow. This is a risky strategy by Turkey, exposing itself to IS attacks, but also to renewed violence amongst its own Kurdish minority spurred by the PKK. 40,000 died during the PKK insurgency here. If the ceasefire breaks now, the ghosts of the past could be re-awakened. Today a show of force by Turkish authorities against those rallying for peace. They and other critics say Turkey’s air strikes against IS are just a cover for the real target, the Kurds. This crucial Middle Eastern player is picking its fights, but the tactic could back fire. Thousand of migrants have arrived in Athens in the past few days, after initially being smuggled onto the Greek islands. They’ve landed in a country in the midst of an economic crisis, which is struggling to provide them with aid. The migrants, many of whom are from Afghanistan, have run out of money and are having to camp in one of the city’s main parks. From Athens, here’s Chris Morris. Seeking shelter wherever they can. A long way from home. Hundreds of Afghans are camped out in this park in central Athens, many of them now penniless. More than 5,000 migrants have arrived in this cityjust in the past week. In one corner, the Resuli family. The strain is understandably beginning to tell. It’s taken them two months to get this far. We came here with great difficulty, says 12-year-old Fatima. Over the mountains and across the sea. They’re hoping to get to Sweden, but right now, they’ve run out of money altogether. There is advice and support on offer, but the current financial restrictions on Greek banks make it difficult for relatives and friends abroad to send any extra money to help them move on. So they stop here because they have nowhere to go. And as you can see, the situation is tragic. They have nothing to eat, they can’t find easily water. It’s too hot. When you think of humanitarian crisis, a crisis inside the crisis. Besides our poor people, we have now people that are more poor, and they have nothing. Local generosity is on display here, helping to keep things together. But the country that’s almost bankrupt can only offer so much. This isjust a small sample of the 100,000 or so people who’ve been smuggled into Greece so far this year. Many of them have already left, heading for northern Europe. But the poorest of the poor are stuck here, in a city that’s already struggling to cope. Because more migrants arrived in Greece in the first six months of this year than anywhere else in the EU. And the country that’s still trying to secure it’s financial future is also on the front line of another human crisis, for which lasting solutions are perhaps even harder to find. Chris Morris, BBC News, Athens. With all the sport- here’s Olly Foster at the BBC Sport Centre. Chris Froome should become the first British cyclist to win the Tour de France twice. He saw his lead cut today in the final mountain stage but will head to Paris tomorrow with a 1.12 minute lead, so a victory parade up the Champs Elysee awaits. Here’s our sports editor, Dan Roan. This report contains flashing images. Such has been his dominance, it’s felt like Chris froom won the Tour De France some time ago, with the penultimate stage in this most iconic and gruelling of settings, nothing could be taken for granted. The British rider started the day with a two-and-a-half minute lead over the main challenger. When the Colombian made his move Team Sky reined him in. Only the climb of the mountain stood between Froome and glory. Despite constant denials, the leader has faced a growing tide of suspicion of doping from some sceptics and the ill fooling overspilled again. Froome has had accusations, insults and urine thrown at him and now appeared to be spat at by a spectator for the second day in succession. The last three weeks had taken their toll. Froome was struggling, but in a thrilling finale, he dug deep to survive one final test. Britain’s first double champion of the world’s most famous bike race. It was always a dream for me to be able to ride the general classification. I knewl able to ride the general classification. I knew I could climb well, I could time trial well.

The worst july storm here Netherlands. The winds picked up here. The worstjuly storm here on records, gusts of over 70mph. A lot of thunder storms leading to widespread travel disruption. We’re seeing the back of that deepening area of low pressure. A lot of isobars on the chart. Today we’ve beenin isobars on the chart. Today we’ve been in between these systems. The next weather system comes in from the Atlantic, bringing with it cloud, wind and rain, not as bad as Friday. It will be a chilly but bright start across Scotland, north-east England. The winds blow the cloud and rain north and eastwards. Heavy bursts before it turns more showery in the North West. The best of the weather northern Scotland, central, southern Scotland turning wetter through the afternoon. Rain in Northern Ireland, heavy at times. It will turn wetter in northern England during the afternoon. That really depresses the tournament. Later on something brighter, but heavy showers boosting those temperatures a touch. But a poor afternoon across the South-East and East Anglia. It doesn’t get better for the beginning of next week. We’re under this area of high pressure. In the centre of it we have light winds across North Wales, northern England, slow moving thundery down pours. A cold day for eastern Scotland on Monday. Some rain in Scotland and Northern Ireland, southern parts of England and Wales # We’re not going out # Not staying in # just hanging around With my head in a spin # But there is no need To scream and shout # We’re not going out # We are not going out. # Have you looked at this thing? It’s terrifying. I’d never have got on the flight if I’d seen this. It’s only the emergency instructions. It’s the drink prices. I’m not going anywhere near the emergency instructions. I don’t want tips on how to die in a plane crash, thank you very much. I’ve told you, you’re a thousand times more likely to die crossing the road than you are in a plane crash. Oh, that’s not true. Isn’t it? Well, think about it. Crossing the road is quite safe. Whereas being in a plane crash is really quite dangerous. Planes are extremely safe. Unless you’re crossing the road in front of one. We’re far more likely to die in the taxi on the way to the hotel. So, if you die taxiing down the runway, does that count as both? Oh, God. Can we please stop talking about death? If you’re nervous, distract yourself. Do some reading. Reading? How do you expect me to be able to read? Try sounding out each letter and use the pictures to help you guess. This is part of the reason why I’m nervous in the first place. I’ve told you, it’s nothing. The newspaper says the threat’s only gone from grey to brown. My underpants could have told you that. There are thousands of flights every day, and there hasn’t been a terrorist attack for a very long time. OK. So we’re due one any day. If I’d have known you were going to be this nervous, I’d have told you to take a pill. Airlines don’t like you taking lots of pills. Or drink. My uncle did both. Got into big trouble. What happened? They sacked him. He was a pilot? No, my family aren’t that irresponsible, thank you, Lee. He was in air traffic control. If you’re not going to read the newspaper, read something else. You can read my book if you like. It’s all about the fear of flying. You’ve not got a fear of flying. Give it a chance, I’m only halfway through. Can’t you just relax and look forward to the holiday?

The USA has lost 5 million players over the last decade, and in 2013, for the eighth straight year, more golf courses closed than opened in America. Norman despite being an Australian who resides in Florida told our reporter Chris Mitchell that he wants to see big changes. You’ve got to get out of this traditional box that golf is in. You have to open it up to the savvy social media, connected with my device, to 70,000 followers, if they’ve got a Twitter account, or to their best mates, if they live somewhere else, in another part of the world. You have to open that up. If a kid wants to get in a golf cart and play loud music, let them do it. No! Absolutely. The members will be apoplectic! The traditionalists will say, you can’t do that. But you know what? If you want your club to survive, if you don’t want to have the burden of maintaining the golf course out of your own pocket, you have to bring in the use. You keep the platform the same. If someone wants to play nine holes, fine. They are out there for an hour and a half and they are gone. They might play with their son or their daughter. But if their son wants to play with their earphones and listen to music while they are going round, please have that. If they want to come out and dress a little bit different, OK. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers says his relationship with Raheem Sterling never suffered, even after the 20-year-old asked for a transfer in May. The Reds are currently in Thailand on a pre-season tour that also covers Malaysia and Australia with Sterling not among the squad having had a $76 million bid accepted by Manchester City on Sunday. The club has agreed with another club a deal for Raheem to The club has agreed with another club a dealfor Raheem to be transferred, and, subject to medical, that will go through. It’s the first question, hopefully, answered. The second one, contrary to probably the last week or so, in terms of what was written, Raheem and I have always remained very strong in our relationship, and has been right up until we left. So there’s no issue there. Leicester City have announced that Claudio Ranieri has become their new manager following the sacking of Nigel Pearson. The 63-year-old formerjuventus, Monaco and Inter manager returns to the English Premier League for the first time since he was sacked by Chelsea in 2004 and has penned a three year contract having been recently removed as Greece manager afterjust four games in charge. The Barcelona squad returned to training on Monday along with new signing Arda Turan who can’t feature untiljanuary due to the Catalan club’s transfer ban. He was warmly greeted by Andres Iniesta and Luis Suarez although Lionel Messi and Neymar were missing after playing in the Copa America. The Spanish and European champions depart next week for their pre-season USA tour with a first up match against LA Galaxy in California USA will be looking to make it a perfect three from three in Group A of the Concacaf Gold Cup when they play Panama just over half-an- hour from now. The matches the second of a double-header in Kansas City with Haiti and Honduras playing the opening match. It is currently still one -0 to Haiti. That would mean they would go up to second position in the table if they do hang on for the win. There’s about a minute and a half of normal time remaining. England bowlerjames Anderson says the current team has the right mix of players, talent and confidence to make a big statement in the Ashes. After winning the first Test in Cardiff, he claims the squad can’t We’ve got a lot of confidence when through the team now from that first victory. And we’ve got to try to use that as the series goes on. We know the Australians will fight back hard and come harder at Lord’s. It is ourjob now to try to improve on what we did at Cardiff, which was a really good performance. Australia have struggled with injuries with Ryan Harris retiring prior to the series and there could be a replacement if changes need to be made. I hope so. Yeah, I’ve certainly been bowling enough, bowling the red ball, trying, I guess, to learn, to remember how to swing the ball and all those things. I couldn’t be happier with where I am, so, yes, I’m ready fora game, and if it’s a test match, I’d certainly be quite nervous, but, yeah, I’d hope I’m ready. Finally if you like getting down and dirty, in a running sense, then this is for you. Every summer the Dutch village of Schermerhorn, just north of Amsterdam is the site for a unique event, the Prutmarathon. The runners are sent on the track and try their best to beat the competition while running over the grass and through the muddy trenches. The village’s fire-fighters helped out and supplied the outdoor showers, the local mayor was the announcer and the local high school girls helped clean the competitors to raise funds. It is currently still 1-0 between Haiti and Honduras. If the results days that it is, they would move up to second place, meaning Panama need to come up with something in the game against the USA, which kicks off injust over game against the USA, which kicks off in just over half-an-hour’s time, if they are to go through to the next round. But from me and the rest of the team, it is goodbye. Hi there. Yesterday was, well, a pretty dismal day for many of us. A lot of low cloud, outbreaks of rain pushing eastwards across the country, thanks to an area of low pressure. Low pressure formed another weather front that stretches 2,500 miles into the Atlantic. As that low pressure now affects Europe, the next one will come in for Tuesday and this bump will bring more damp weather. More rain on the way for some of us towards the end of the week. Overnight tonight, It will be pretty cloudy across England and Wales with mist and fog around the coasts and hills. Outbreaks of light rain and drizzle and feeling very humid, especially across East Anglia with temperatures of 17. A fresher feel for Northern Ireland and Scotland. Tuesday will be another cloudy and damp day, particularly for England and Wales. There will be drizzle to start and it will be misty and murky across the Brecon Beacons and the moors of southwest England with fog on the hills. The cloud could thicken enough to bring a few spots of rain across the Midlands but moving northwards, generally we are looking at a drier and brighter start to the day, especially across parts of Scotland where you have a decent chance of seeing early morning sunshine. Through the rest of the day, the drizzle will tend to ease off across central and eastern parts of England as we head through the latter part of the morning. But later in the afternoon, the cloud will re-thicken and we will see drizzle extending its way eastwards from Wales and south-west England towards more eastern counties of England as we end the day. Further north, we could see rain for a short time across north-west England, but in Scotland it will be bright with sunny spells. A few showers in the east. Wednesday, although it starts off cloudy, many of us will see some sunshine during Wednesday afternoon across the south. There will be one or two heavy showers on Wednesday that it will be warmer and in London temperatures could reach 24 degrees and it will feel pretty humid. The third of our low pressures rocks up on Thursday and Friday, bringing outbreaks of rain to Northern Ireland on Thursday with strengthening winds off the Irish Sea. These south-easterly winds will be pulling in warm air from the Continent. Temperatures on the face of it, could reach 25 in London. We could see temperatures climbing into the high 20s depending on how much sunshine we get and how much cloud there is in the sky as well. By Friday, the low pressure will have moved to the north and west, so we will see outbreaks of rain with potentially gale-force winds on the coast, and outbreaks of rain for Scotland. Still holding onto some warm weather across southeastern counties of England. That’s your forecast. ~ Welcome to BBC News, broadcasting to viewers on public television in the US and around the globe. I’m Gavin Grey. Our top stories: The Greek prime minister faces growing opposition at home to the new austerity measures he’s agreed to in exchange for a new bailout.

Hello. The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, is facing growing opposition in Athens to the new austerity measures he’s agreed to in exchange for a new bailout. Under the plan Greece will get a third bailout but only if it signs up to stringent new reforms in the next few days. There’ll be a short-term loan to keep the country solvent and allow the banks to reopen. In return, Parliament must agree the extensive reforms demanded by European creditors. And that would pave the way for a third bailout in five years of 86 billion euros. We start our coverage with this report from our Europe Editor, Katya Adler. It was a long, long night, billed as the last chance for a deal on Greece. EU hacks are used to last-minute late-night deals, not ones stretching through till breakfast time. Talks nearly collapsed altogether. Eurozone leaders were on a knife-edge. Don’t be fooled by this smile. The Greek Prime Minister had very few friends here. Trust in his government is at an all-time low, following months of backtracking and insults. After 15 hours of arguments he and the hardline German Chancellor reached an impasse. The two leaders threatened to walk out. Pulled back from the brink, a weary-looking Chancellor Merkel assured doubters this morning she is now on board with the Greece deal. TRANSLATION: The situation is tense, so it’s in everyone’s interest to make the next steps work. If the Greek Parliament does its bit trust can be regained. But conditions imposed on Greeks are harsh. Their Prime Minister had promised an end to what he called creditor-imposed humiliation. He knows he will struggle to sell this deal at home. ""The deal is difficult,"" he said, ""but we have avoided financial ""asphyxiation and the collapse of the financial system. ""We fought as hard as we could."" So, what next? To rebuild trust, the Greek Parliament is expected to pass VAT, tax and pension reforms this week. Eurozone finance ministers are working out an interim agreement to keep Greek banks afloat and debt repayment honoured. Worth an estimated 80 billion euros, the new bailout will be spread over three years, starting late summer, if all those involved can agree. There are a lot of ifs involved here. This was no glorious victory, for Greece or its eurozone partners. Sure, they arrived bleary-eyed this morning with their we-did-it message. But don’t forget, today’s deal is about sitting down at a later date to hammer out those details. And as for reducing Greece’s crippling debt, that has been put on the backburner again. So, today’s agreement does not solve the Greek crisis in the long term, and serious rifts between eurozone countries have been exposed, not just with Greece, but between EU powers Germany, and a more conciliatory France. The French President said a compromise on Greece was necessary for EU unity. TRANSLATION: Today was a long negotiation, but above all, a historic decision, because if Greece had left the eurozone, what would have been said? That the eurozone wasn’t able to ensure its integrity and its solidarity? The eurozone would have gone backwards when it needs to go forwards. What leaders wanted more than anything here was to restore trust in the wider eurozone, and there a victory has been achieved. After months of speculation, talk of Greece falling out of the single currency has gone, for now. The deal has had a mixed reception in Greece - our Chief correspondent, Gavin Hewitt, reports from Athens. Petralona, an Athens neighbourhood that supported Alexis Tsipras in his stand against austerity. They woke to a deal that kept Greece in the euro. But here, there was more bewilderment than celebration. TRANSLATION: The country cannot bear these reform measures. It’s going to become even more poor. You can see for yourself, watch around. It used to be better before. Ilias had supported the radical-left party Syriza, believing it would say no to further cuts. TRANSLATION: I believed in Syriza, I voted for them. I think Syriza betrayed its friends and its ideas. It did a 180-degrees turn. Elsewhere in the capital, the mood was different. Greece had secured its future in Europe. We are happy because we think this is going to bring stability to the country. We want to be in the euro, and now we are 100% sure we are with the Europeans, and Ifeel much more secure at the moment and relieved. But the deal is controversial. The government has to identify 50 billion euros of valuable publicly owned assets like ports, and then transfer them to a special fund to be privatised. It will be managed by Greece but supervised by outsiders. People’s lives here will change. Early retirement will end. VAT will go up on many food items. Sunday trading will be allowed, and trade unions weakened. Even some cabinet ministers are struggling to accept this. There was forced agreement, under tremendous political pressure and the imminent threat of the death of the economy due to the closure of the banks. Did Greece surrender? No, we survived. The minister told me that the Europe of austerity had won. The Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has arrived back in Athens. His next challenge is to get Parliament to agree to the new measures by Wednesday, and so unlock negotiations towards a third bailout. Almost certainly, the raft of new measures, the tax increases, the pension reforms, will be approved by the Parliament. But the Prime Minister will have to rely on the support of other parties, raising questions as to whether in the long term these measures will be fully implemented. At least we will have the potential for confidence to return. But this will take time, and of course a lot will depend on the banking sector and how quickly banks will reopen. Even though there is widespread relief that Greece is staying in the euro, many here say too much sovereignty has been surrendered. Gavin Hewitt, BBC News. There are growing expectations that a comprehensive deal on Iran’s nuclear programme will be announced in Vienna. Six world powers and Iran are reported to have drawn up a 100-page document listing restrictions on Iran’s nuclear activity and easing of sanctions. What’s being described as a ""comprehensive meeting"" is scheduled for 8 o’clock GMT. Earlier, our Chief International Correspondent, Lyse Doucet, sent this update from outside the hotel where the talks are taking place. All the world’s media have been camped out here for weeks, waiting for the negotiators who have been huddled inside. Some negotiators telling us that they didn’t leave the hotel at all, except for a one-day dash to their capitals. And in these last hours, there is a real sense now that it is almost, almost within reach. And I know that is a phrase that has been used a lot, but we sense different things. For example, they are discussing the logistics of an announcement tomorrow, the buses which would take the journalists, the interviews that would happen. The discussion and the mood are definitely different, but there is still that caution. It is not there yet. There are still some talks that need to take place, and we’re eyeing those balconies, just to see who comes out and who stays long into the night. Vali Nasr, a former senior advisor at the State Department, said both sides had been held back by domestic politics. I think the technicalities of the deal are easy to resolve. What keeps this deal from being concluded is politics at home. I think what holds the hands of both sides at the negotiating table is that they are worried about how a particular item is going to be construed back home. And it is also tough selling Iran as well, not necessarily with the public, but with the establishment. Both sides are trying to go home with a deal they can sell. Let’s round-up some of the other main stories: New York City has agreed to pay $5.9 million to the family of Eric Garner who died after a violent arrest in 2014. After a confrontation, police officer Daniel Pantaleo put Garner in a neck hold and he was wrestled to the ground and restrained by force. The arrest was captured on video and sparked protests across the US. There’s been rioting in Belfast in Northern Ireland, as police tried to prevent a Protestant Orange Order parade from entering a nationalist area of the city. At least eight officers were injured after being pelted with rocks and bottles. A sixteen year old girl was taken to hospital after being hit by a car. The police used water cannon against the crowd. Mexico’s Interior Minister has held a meeting with state governors on how to prevent an increase in violence following the escape of the country’s most wanted drug lord from a top securityjail. A manhunt is under way across Mexico and neighbouring countries to try to recapture joaquin Guzman, known as ""Shorty."" It’s feared his escape could trigger a violent turf war across Mexico between rival drug ca rtels. NASA say a spacecraft launched nine years ago is on schedule to fly past Pluto later on Tuesday. The New Horizon will take pictures and collect data from the dwarf planet. Here’s our science reporter Rebecca Morelle. A mysterious world slowly coming into view. These are the latest images captured by new horizons as it. Closes in on Pluto. But they are nothing compared to what we will see after the fly by. We have now visited every planet in our solar system, but not Pluto. It. Is a place we know almost nothing about. We will not rethink our understanding. We will see it. For the first time.

Was controversially demoted from a planet to a dwarf world. That does not make exploration any less thrilling. Here at the headquarters scientists have been waiting patiently for this moment for nearly a decade and now the stages finally set for the spacecraft’s arrival. We have been promised that the pictures sent back should be spectacular. This is vital, because Pluto’s home in the Khyber Belt is were all eyes are trained. -- Kuiper Belt. It.

This is BBC News. The latest headlines: The Greek Prime Minister is facing resistance in Athens to sweeping new austerity measures he agreed to introduce in exchange for a new bailout. Representatives of six world powers and Iran are still working on a deal OI’I Back to our top story. Andrew Apostolu, is an economics historian and author. He has written extensively on Greece’s financial problems and about failed economies. Thank you forjoining us. First of all, the big vote in the Greek parliament on Wednesday, how do you expect it to go, will it pass? That is a great question but the problem is Alexis Tsipras has always had to betray the voters. He had to do it in january by betray the voters. He had to do it injanuary by promising things they couldn’t give and then he got the referendum backing and now he is going back on what he said he would do. He is in a tight spot but he will have the support, Audley, of the opposition parties that he has successfully destroyed. They will probably give him enough to get through -- oddly. He’s trying to tell the creditors that he is serious while winking at the Greek people and saying that he isn’t. He needs to get liquidity for the banks to reopen and it is shocking how long they have been closed in Greece. If he can’t do that, they are in even bigger trouble. As you put it come out that lack of trust in winking to the Greek people, that is what took so many European leaders by alarm. But now that this has all been put forward, how will Greece and ordinary Greeks cope with these reforms? Greek society is coping horribly and any country would do in the same circumstances. Incomes are down by 40% on average which means there are people who have had more than half of their income taken away. I couldn’t cope with that. It is a very difficult situation. The problem is that Greece doesn’t have the institutions to implement the reforms. A very simple example, they don’t even have a land registry. They started a project to begin one in 1994 and they still haven’t finished. They say they will finish in 2020. That his 26 years to do a land registry. That is ridiculous and the fact is you can’t have a proper land registry -- if you can’t, how can you put forward performs? Alexis Tsipras suspended privatizations after his election injanuary? He is now agreed to 50,000 euros a privatizations. -- of. They didn’t get anywhere near that figure so he can do it but also, he won’t do it -- has. There is a lack of political will. After 1974, Greece needed to build institutions after the military dictatorship and they failed to do so. This takes generations, certainly many years, and Greece has thrown that time away. There is no way they can do this in the short time allowed. Thank you. Here in the UK, Prince William has begun work as an air ambulance pilot. He’s now based at Cambridge airport and will be flying with the East Anglian Air Ambulance service. Our royal correspondent, Nicholas Witchell was there as he took off for his first shift. just want to say very, very happy to be here. First day - nerves! It’s a job he’s chosen to do, and which is hugely important to him - working shifts as an air ambulance pilot, something William regards as both a duty and a necessity. For me, it’s also a really important point to be grounded, and Ifeel doing a job like this really helps with grounding the core of what I’m sort of trying to become. What is that? What are you trying to become? That’s a very good question! I thinkjust, you know, trying to be a good guy, trying to do what you can and trying to be, you know, a decent individual, thoughtful. All those sorts of things, qualities in people that you would want to be associated with. His air ambulance role will be William’s primary occupation. His royal duties will take second place. That seems to suit him. At some point there’s probably going to be a lot more pressure and responsibility from the other side of my life. At the moment I’m juggling the two of them and a young family and I’m enjoying it and I like the challenge. But, yes, inevitably down the line, things will probably become a little bit more difficult for me to do that. And what of that young family? What impact has the arrival of Charlotte had? It’s been obviously fantastic and she’s been a little joy of heaven. But at the same time, it is more responsibility, looking after two little ones, especially when George is around - he’s a little monkey! But it’s fantastic having a lovely family and I’m so thrilled and Catherine has been doing an amazing job as a mother and I’m very proud of her. They now have a son and a daughter, so any plans for more children? We’ve onlyjust had the second one! You never know what’s going to happen in the future. William, juggling family life and a dual sense of duty as a prince and as a pilot. Nicholas Witchell, BBC News, Cambridge Airport. Almost 60 years since it was written, the American author Harper’s Lee’s second novel Go Set a Watchman is going on sale around the world. These eagar fans stayed up until midnight at a bookshop in London in order to be one of the first to get their hands on the eagerly awaited book. This is Harper Lee’s second novel after her Pulitzer Prize-winning To Kill a Mockingbird was published in the 1960’s. Go Set a Watchman is an earlier version of the same story that repaints some of the classic novel’s heros in a less flattering light. That didn’t stop fans from keeping an open mind. |,m I’m quite wary, I guess, of it changing my perception because characters that have meant so much to so many people are being drawn into question and that could be upsetting. I’ve gone into this with an open mind. I don’t feel like I have any expectations of anything. I think that we need to take this book as it was meant to be, on its own as it don’t work of art. Iran over here as soon as I thought was being released and pre- it straightaway. I have had this receipt in the pockets of my pants for the last three months waiting to get my hands on it. This week, one of the biggest names in the toy business is closing its much loved Fifth Avenue location in Manhattan. FAO Schwarz has sold teddy bears and model trains from this iconic spot for more than three decades. The store’s leaving because of rising rents, a citywide problem. As Nada Tawfik reports, FAO Schwarz’s departure is leaving a hole in the hearts of New Yorkers and tourists alike. Eager faces await the opening of FAO Schwarz. just a few more chances to smile and pose with the real-life toy soldiers. The world’s most famous toy store has been the place of fantasies for nearly 30 years here. Who can forget Tom Hanks in the movie Big, playing Heart and Soul on the store’s big piano? The scene helped to raise the brand to worldwide prominence. But up against Fifth Avenue’s rising rents, playtime at this iconic location will soon be over. We have been bringing the grandchildren and the kids for many years to play with toys and the piano. Is sad to see it going. It is not like a normal toy store. It is like trying to find something that shows your personality and the personality of the store. It is a palace of toys, from handmade doll houses to a $1500 stuffed panda, there is plenty of unique options. My name is Stanley and I am a news anchor. Forjoe and Ryan it was a Muppet. FAO Schwarz’s Muppet workshop was the only place where they could customise their very own Muppet. I think the coolest thing is you could watch them put them put the puppet together and actually glue pieces on the face and do the hair and clothes. Watch it take place right in front of you. FAO Schwarz has been struggling with its business model for years, facing competition online and from cheap retailers. Yet other boutique toy stores have adapted and even thrived. In many cases parents are willing to spend more money. Take for example, this high-end doll store on Fifth Avenue. They found a way to not only sell the product but to cash in on the experience. American Girl Place gives customers an incentive to return, giving you the chance to get your doll’s ears pierced and hair done. You can even have a fancy lunch with your doll. It’s priceless because this experience is notjust going to Toys ""R"" Us or FAO Schwarz and buying something and leaving. It is a wining and dining experience with matching outfits and it is so cute. It is just a fun day for the kids. FAO Schwarz says it is committed to building on the legacy of the brand through a new flagship location in the city. Until then, New York will be a little less playful. One of the world’s best known rappers, 50 Cent, has filed for bankruptcy protection after losing a multi-million dollar lawsuit for invading a woman’s privacy on the internet.

A reminder of our top story. The Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras has returned to Athens for meetings with party officials following marathon bailout talks in Brussels. Eurozone leaders agreed to further bailouts for Greece but it is on condition of having some unpopular austerity measures undertaken for the next few years. Hi there. Yesterday was, well, a pretty dismal day for many of us. A lot of low cloud, outbreaks of rain pushing eastwards across the country, thanks to an area of low pressure. Low pressure formed another weather front that stretches 2,500 miles into the Atlantic. As that low pressure now affects Europe, the next one will come in for Tuesday and this bump will bring more damp weather. More rain on the way for some of us towards the end of the week. Overnight tonight, It will be pretty cloudy across England and Wales with mist and fog around the coasts and hills. Outbreaks of light rain and drizzle and feeling very humid, especially across East Anglia with temperatures of 17. A fresher feel for Northern Ireland and Scotland. Tuesday will be another cloudy and damp day, particularly for England and Wales. There will be drizzle to start and it will be misty and murky across the Brecon Beacons and the moors of southwest England with fog on the hills. The cloud could thicken enough to bring a few spots of rain across the Midlands but moving northwards, generally we are looking at a drier and brighter start to the day, especially across parts of Scotland where you have a decent chance of seeing early morning sunshine. Through the rest of the day, the drizzle will tend to ease off across central and eastern parts of England as we head through the latter part of the morning. But later in the afternoon, the cloud will re-thicken and we will see drizzle extending its way eastwards from Wales and south-west England towards more eastern counties of England as we end the day. Further north, we could see rain for a short time across north-west England, but in Scotland it will be bright with sunny spells. A few showers in the east. Wednesday, although it starts off cloudy, many of us will see some sunshine during Wednesday afternoon across the south. There will be one or two heavy showers on Wednesday that it will be warmer and in London temperatures could reach 24 degrees and it will feel pretty humid. The third of our low pressures rocks up on Thursday and Friday, bringing outbreaks of rain to Northern Ireland on Thursday with strengthening winds off the Irish Sea. These south-easterly winds will be pulling in warm air from the Continent. Temperatures on the face of it, could reach 25 in London. We could see temperatures climbing into the high 20s depending on how much sunshine we get and how much cloud there is in the sky as well. By Friday, the low pressure will have moved to the north and west, so we will see outbreaks of rain with potentially gale-force winds on the coast, and outbreaks of rain for Scotland. Still holding onto some warm weather across southeastern counties of England. That’s your forecast. The latest headlines from BBC News: The Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, is meeting ministers in Athens after agreeing sweeping new austerity measures in return for a third international bailout which came with strict conditions. The deal requires Greece to approve tax rises, pension cuts and changes to employment laws by Wednesday. Six world powers including the United States, Russia and Britain have been negotiating with Tehran for seventeen days about scaling down its nuclear activities in return for the lifting of some economic sanctions. The latest deadline for reaching a deal hasjust passed. A space probe is about to reach Pluto after a nine year, three-billion-mile journey. The New Horizons craft will take the very first close-up pictures of the dwarf planet since its discovery in 1930. Early measurements show that Pluto is probably bigger than previously thought. Now on BBC News, Monday in Parliament. Fellow. We will look at the day in Westminster. The headlines, the government claims Westminster is in disarray after responses to the budget. It takes a special kind of genius to have a budget like this in a position. He defends the 2% income commitment to defence spending. Even the economy is growing at the rate of 3% I wonder if my friend can tell me how we will need to be 2% when there is only a half a percent increase in the budget unless it is by raiding other account. A pensions campaigner turned Minister says there is no money to equalise inheritance pensions for widowers and same-sex couples. We are seeing people surviving their partners at the time of recent death, coping with appalling inequality which should be unacceptable... Labour has been accused of having an on the shambles response to the budget. Been mocked their response. Harriet Harman says the party will not oppose these measures but other Labour MPs disagree. Labour says the government has been copping it is policies. They have lost control of spending. They are spending nearly 150,000 million a year they did not have. The biggest structural deficit in the Western world having to borrow £1 in every four they spent. That very day, a note was waiting in the draw the Chief Executive to be telling his successor with brutal bluntness that there is no money. A Conservative led government did what history has regularly called upon it to do which was to pull back the nation from the brink of ruin after the disastrous tournament to a period of Labour government. -- denoument. During the five years that followed, Britain’s boss backs have been transformed. -- Prospect. The deficit cut by half. Not every budget goes according to plan. Some are cheered and others are geared. Such are the ups and downs of government. -- jeered. However, Such are the ups and downs of government. --jeered. However, it takes a special kind of genius to have this budget while in opposition. I am sure the whole house is eagerly awaiting the latest news as to what view the opposition have on the budget. Yesterday, the active leader said that Labour would be supporting the welfare cap and restrictions on family tax credits but within hours of her announcement, three of the four leadership contenders all denounced her. What is truly terrifying, when his government introduces a two child policy that is going to visit and punish upon the most vulnerable and poorest in our society, that is the terrifying thing about this budget. They made that intervention in the PLP meeting this afternoon. That is the official Labour party policy. He will want to make his intervention there. The grim reality is that millions of hard-working families will be worse off as a result of this budget. The Chancellor gave with one hand but took away so much more with the other. Of course we welcome action to tackle low pay. The minimum wage was after all a Labour policy and one of the proudest achievements of the last Labour government. We first introduced it in the face of fierce Tory opposition and indeed, more recently, we campaigned to increase its. There were some things in the budget that we do welcome. -- it. Indeed it seems that the Labour manifesto found its way into the Chancellor’s breadbox. I know he likes to wear high-vis but I did not know he likes cross dressing. -- Red Box. All these policies, the Chancellor seems to be a late convert to the Labour policy. The latest test of this budget is whether it helps working people and meets the long-term challenges facing the country. These things mean no sense. Shelter housing services which keep the elderly active and services such as the Glasgow Association for mental health, stopping those with mental health problem slipping into crisis. This makes no sense. We spend to save investments at that level. The Defence Secretary has denied cooking the books to meet the government’s pledged to needs 2% of gigabits GDP on defence. -- GDP. The promise was made by the Chancellor in his budget last week. Michael Fallon was challenged by MPs on both side of the house when it became apparent that he plans to increase intelligence spending and other items in the defence budget to make sure they reach Nato’s 2% annual spending target. This target has been achieved by including the single intelligence account as defence spending. When might the government needs the 2% target without cooking the books? We have already made it clear that no books are going to be caught. --. Anything included has to meet the Nato guidelines where there is expenditure on defence intelligence. That that comes out of the defence budget, that is right thatit the defence budget, that is right that it should be included in our defence totals. The Nato figures will be there for everybody to see. With the Chancellor’s announcement in the budget to spend 2% of GDP on defence, could face a whether the single intelligence account and the £800 million of military pension spending are to be included as part of the defence budget? I hope that the honourable lady will welcome the announcement last week that we are going to continue to meet the Nato target so far as pensions are concerned. If they are on the defence budget, yes, of course they count as defence expenditure and have been on the defence budget for a long time, in fact. So long as intelligence matters are concerned, money spent on defence should probably be counted as defence. Can they confirm, according to the Nato definition, only intelligence operations in support of the military can be used to contribute to the 2% figure. And also, whether they used this definition or not. And how much is that? I was hoping that the Shadow Defence Secretary might have welcomed the 2% commitment. Let me be clear. It is for Nato to classify according to their guidelines as to what is counted as defence expenditure, where there is money being spent on defence in our defence budget, yes of course it should count towards the 2% total. How much would we fall short of spending 2% of GDP on defence if we did not include items of expenditure which are normally born on the budgets of other government departments? As I made clear to the house, it is for Nato in the end to classify from each member’s return what properly counts as defence expenditure in the table thatis as defence expenditure in the table that is published each year. Given that the economy is growing at around 3%, I wonder if my honourable friend can tell me how we will meet the 2% when there is only a half a percent increase in the budget unless it is by raiding other account. The fact is, we are meeting the 2% commitment this year and we will do so, asl the 2% commitment this year and we will do so, as I have just said, over each year of this Parliament. They raised defence spending but took a different tack. What promises can be given that defence spending in Scotland will increase? Between 2007 and 2012, Scotland received £1.9 billion less in its pocket of government defence spending on major projects, perhaps the minister should stop paying lip service and put things right. I don’t think it is lipservice. We have committed nearly £1 billion, asl is lipservice. We have committed nearly £1 billion, as I have said, to building the next generation of frigates in Scotland. We are already building offshore patrol vessels in Scotland. They are getting the bulk of the work on the two aircraft carriers. It will be home to one of the three fast jet leaks. carriers. It will be home to one of the three fastjet leaks. It the three fast jet leaks. It will constitute the entire home submarine base. --jets. constitute the entire home submarine base. -- jets. They do well out of the defence budget inside a United Kingdom. You wait two months for one government defeat in the Lord and then three come at once. The government lost laws for the first time in the General Election. Labour and Lib Dems have put forward an amendment, making it clearthat local devolution would not be conditional on an area excepting Anderlecht had met. -- an collected. This is allowing proposals from authorities should not have to seek an elected Mayor where they have an alternative model of government and leadership that they consider best suiting their circumstances. It represents a huge concentration of power in one person and it raises the question, as we debated at committee stage, whether the range of responsibilities is so vast that one person cannot do it all. You have senators in America. Huge power. In Germany, in France. They have seen perfectly capable of handling this massive responsibility. -- seemed. Are the English so impoverished as deep or that we have no one in our country capable of doing what every advanced economy can do? -- as people. They think it is a good idea, at least the leadership to. The public, whenever they are consulted, say, no, we don’t. Thankyou very much. What is the political class do? They say, you will have it whether you want it or not. The party opposite has a risk, if we go down their route we will never get there at all. We will go on fiddling about with the system. We will not make the changes necessary. The people of written will continue to live in one of the most tantalised societies in western Europe. -- Britain. That is not right. I believe in devolution. But it needs the two lead. That is why this amendment should be opposed. I respect his position in favour of devolution. But if his answer to that is to have strong people leading both parties which are just like Secretaries of State so we have a mirror in local government of what is happening in larger government. That is not the route I want to go. A sense of place needs collaborative, consensual arrangements that the local people want and support. If they choose a man, that is fine by me, but it does not be imposed on us by then. On BBC Radio Sheffield this very morning, there is very morning, what was being said from there, notjust by politicians but by businesspeople as well, it is, we don’t necessarily want a mayor. It is unfair that we are being told that we need a mayor, particularly after a few months after the people had a voice and they said no. What arrogance to say that this place knows what better the government’s arrangements are for cities and for other places in this country. The Lords voted in favour of the opposition amendment by a majority of 67. The support speech continues on Wednesday. You are watching Monday in Parliament. The top story, the Communities Secretary calls Labour’s response to the budget a shambles. How to pay for the police was the question. Structural changes were questioned but it was also argued that cuts across the board unfairly penalized those who were needed in the first place. The crux of the story is, there has been a big movement in policing towards more around public protection, looking after the most vulnerable people in society, protecting them and pursuing and managing the most dangerous and violent and sex offenders in society. That is a national picture. To simplify it, we’ve created a typical force on a typical day. This autumn, we will make available to every force in the country a template so they can populate it for their own circumstances. Not all demand on the police is crime related. Infact, it is a relatively small proportion, and the first principle of the police is to keep people safe and to prevent crime and public disorder. That is the first thing to say. The other thing is, in relation to demand, police need to not only consider patent demand but latent demand. People who are too afraid or in some other way inhibited, fearful of coming to the police and asking for help, those are people who are likely to be in considerable distress. We are carrying out an inspection into so-called honour- based violence, for example. The general view is that savings in the 2010-15 Parliament was possible to achieve, largely through squeezing money out of the current system. There were collaborations, but still not really a strategic solution across the whole of policing in England and Wales, and the report sets out the wide variety of responses to that. I think most of us, including the Chief Constables, would take the view that depending on the savings that are identified, and I’m not going to lead with my chin with the Treasuryjust yet on the Spending Review, but if we are looking at significant savings this time, we will have to look more thoroughly at structural reform, and therefore, integration of specialist capabilities, partnership working, as well as all the traditional efficiencies in procurement, are going to have to be part of the answer. Different forces are in different positions. They have different requirements as regards the threat they face and their residents face and so on. So, the funding formula ought to take that into account, correct? Yes. And the funding formula which has previously been applied, obviously we are we are interested in looking at past value for money as well, took into account amongst other things, according to paragraph 1.11 of the NAO’s report, fear of crime, population, policing, special events and so on. And that funding formula presumably was designed by the Home Office, correct? Yes. Why, having designed that formula, did you not apply it? Well, it was applied and then essentially fixed in 2010, and some elements of it are becoming obsolete anyway, the data on which it is based is becoming obsolete, so even if we stuck with that formula, we would need to try and update it when the data is available. Ministers decided that we should apply the same... By damping so that the same percentage cut was taken by all forces from the position in 2010. That is why the outcome now is out of kilter with the original funding formula. Indeed, and so what essentially happened was that equal percentage reductions were applied to every force in England and Wales? Yes. How on earth is that fair to those forces who had already made efficiency savings and already got their back offices in order, like Lincolnshire Police? They should receive the same percentage cut as a force which had been profligate, and had not gone through those efficiency savings. Well, Iam not saying it is, the funding for this, I think I think had flaws, it clearly moved further and further, the outcome has clearly moved further away from the funding formula, and the funding formula itself, the old funding formula, has become more detached from the real demands on policing. That is why we are proposing to revise it. The Pensions Minister, Lady Altmann - prior to her appointment, a well-known pensions campaigner- has defended the Government’s policy not to equalise retirement income for widowers and same-sex couples. Lady Altmann pointed out the decision had been declared lawful in the courts. I would like to focus just on the situation of female GPs, many of whom have retired around the beginning of this century. They contributed an identical amount to their male counterparts. The widows of the male doctors get 50% pension. Is she aware that the widowers currently, possibly those in the future, will at the moment only get about 18%? Can my noble friend rectify this anomaly, bearing in mind that both parties, male and female, have contributed an equal amount of money to the pension? The specific differences in treatment between male and female scheme members for the purpose of survivor benefits in public service pension schemes, for service prior to 1988, was held to be lawful in 2011. This judgement was made in the Cockburn case, which specifically discussed a widower whose partner was a member of the National Health Service pension scheme, and the judgement effectively said that there was in that case an objective and reasonable justification not to make retrospective changes in relation to new policy being introduced. She said schemes were based on a change in the law from 40 years ago. In those days, it was unusual for the man to be the partner who was working with a dependent. It was usual, sorry, for the man to be the partner working with a dependent female partner. Female workers with a dependent husband were not the social norm, and the scheme funding would have been based on the expectation that a female member would not have a dependent survivor, whereas the male would have a dependent survivor. This issue of equality should have been dealt with prior to the Civil Partnership Act and the Same Sex Marriage Act, and actually what we’re seeing is people surviving their partners at the time of recent death, coping with appalling inequalities which should be unacceptable, and will the Minister act with expertise and expedite this matter urgently? The Government is very sympathetic to the principles of equality, and if we were confident that equalising these benefits was straightforward, affordable and sustainable, we would be happy to support more equalisation. But we have to think very carefully before imposing retrospective costs on schemes which they could not have taken into account in their funding assumptions in the past. The Minister said in the Sunday Times last November, there have been so many unfairnesses in pensions over the years. Sadly, this is another unfairness, and should not be permitted these days. In the light of that, is the Government going to bring forward proposals very quickly to match the words, and can I ask what provision the Government have now made to meet the costs of addressing restrictions on survivor benefit payments if that decision is lifted? The treatment that we currently have has been found to be lawful. This has been challenged in the courts. If the Government had a ready source of funding, the issue would have been dealt with by now. These issues are complex, and are still being considered, and we will issue our response in due course. Monday saw maiden speeches from new members of Parliament during the Budget debate. As is traditional, the new MPs calmed their nerves, paid tribute to their predecessors and spoke warmly of their new constituencies. It was 1066 years ago that another form of Parliament sat in my constituency. Proving that Somerset has a Parliamentary tradition some three centuries older than this modern building that we find ourselves in today. The reason I tell you that is that should the unhappy occurrence happen that we have to pack our toothbrushes and order papers and decant to the provinces, Somerton will be only too pleased to welcome us back. Most of our residents have to commute out of the area for work. We simply do not have enough localjobs for local people. I will not beat about the bush. My mission as their Member of Parliament is to help make our town centres have is once again, to support local businesses so that my constituents can live in their constituency and work there. We have an emerging digital hub. The town desperately needs a railway station to be reopened. To support the high street, tourism and improve the quality of life of local residents. This is something I will continue to fight for. Nearly 2000 years after the Romans first set up on the river, our port continues to thrive. Last year, the port of Southampton handled over 843,000 cars, 60% of which were exports. This year, there will be over 430 cruise ships, handling 1.6 million passengers, and over1 million containers will arrive or leave through our port. Mr Deputy Speaker, listening to other honourable members, I realise how lucky we are in Southampton to have a Premier League football club. A club which now holds the record for the fastest hat-trick in Premier League history, scoring against the Prime Minister’s team when they thrashed them 6-1. Erewash is the land of opportunity and aspiration, we make practically anything the members care to name, from textiles, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics to furniture, pipes and even beer. In addition to supplying some of this country’s biggest names, including Rolls-Royce, Boots and john Lewis, it is clearly a global brand with many engineering and manufacturing firms exporting goods. We have even designed and manufactured our own dialect, helpfully recorded in a book, a copy of which is available to members from my office. Last month, they put on a night of music to give the kids on the estate some fun and to keep them out of mischief. Value each and every one of them, no matter what the background. The shop on the Overchurch estate gives out food parcels for those in need. The majority going to people who are actually in work but who still cannot afford to feed their children. The Chancellor’s announcement of cuts to working tax credits in his Budget will hit working people hard. Especially those who are struggling to feed their families. Churches across the constituency provide foodbanks, meals and company to those who have fallen on hard times, as well as celebrating the spiritual life of the community. Margaret Greenwood.

I’m Gavin Grey. Our top stories: The Greek prime minister faces growing opposition at home to the new austerity measures he’s agreed to in exchange for a new bailout. Marathon talks aimed at curbing Iran’s nuclear ambitions continue in Vienna, a comprehensive meeting is scheduled in a few hours’ time. Turf war fears, Mexico’s interior minister meets with state governors to discuss preventing an increase in violence following prison escape of the country’s most wanted drug lord. Pluto as we’ve never seen it before. NASA’s Horizons spacecraft prepares to sweep past the icy dwarf planet and send back the clearest images yet. Hello. The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, is facing growing opposition in Athens to the new austerity measures he’s agreed to in exchange for a new bailout. Under the plan Greece will get a third bailout but only if it signs up to stringent new reforms in the next few days. There’ll be a short-term loan to keep the country solvent and allow the banks to reopen. In return, Parliament must agree the extensive reforms demanded by European creditors. And that would pave the way for a third bailout in five years of 86 billion euros. We start our coverage with this report from our Europe Editor, Katya Adler. It was a long, long night, billed as the last chance for a deal on Greece. EU hacks are used to last-minute late-night deals, not ones stretching through till breakfast time. Talks nearly collapsed altogether. Eurozone leaders were on a knife-edge. Don’t be fooled by this smile. The Greek Prime Minister had very few friends here. Trust in his government is at an all-time low following months of backtracking and insults. After 15 hours of arguments he and the hardline German Chancellor reached an impasse. The two leaders threatened to walk out. Pulled back from the brink, a weary-looking Chancellor Merkel assured doubters this morning she is now on board with the Greece deal. TRANSLATION: The situation is tense, so it’s in everyone’s interest to make the next steps work. If the Greek Parliament does its bit trust can be regained. But conditions imposed on Greeks are harsh. Their Prime Minister had promised an end to what he called creditor-imposed humiliation. He knows he will struggle to sell this deal at home. ""The deal is difficult,"" he said, ""but we have avoided financial ""asphyxiation and the collapse of the financial system. ""We fought as hard as we could."" So, what next? To rebuild trust, the Greek Parliament is expected to pass VAT, tax and pension reforms this week. Eurozone finance ministers are working out an interim agreement to keep Greek banks afloat and debt repayment honoured. Worth an estimated 80 billion euros, the new bailout will be spread over three years, starting late summer, if all those involved can agree. There are a lot of ifs involved here. This was no glorious victory, for Greece or its eurozone partners. Sure, they arrived bleary-eyed this morning with their we-did-it message. But don’t forget, today’s deal is about sitting down at a later date to hammer out those details. And as for reducing Greece’s crippling debt, that has been put on the backburner again. So, today’s agreement does not solve the Greek crisis in the long term, and serious rifts between eurozone countries have been exposed, not just with Greece, but between EU powers Germany, and a more conciliatory France. The French President said a compromise on Greece was necessary for EU unity. TRANSLATION: Today was a long negotiation, but above all, a historic decision, because if Greece had left the eurozone, what would have been said? That the eurozone wasn’t able to ensure its integrity and its solidarity? The eurozone would have gone backwards when it needs to go forwards. What leaders wanted more than anything here was to restore trust in the wider eurozone, and there a victory has been achieved. After months of speculation, talk of Greece falling out of the single currency has gone, for now. The deal has had a mixed reception in Greece, our Chief correspondent, Gavin Hewitt, reports from Athens. Petralona, an Athens neighbourhood that supported Alexis Tsipras in his stand against austerity. They woke to a deal that kept Greece in the euro. But here, there was more bewilderment than celebration. TRANSLATION: The country cannot bear these reform measures. It’s going to become even more poor. You can see for yourself, watch around. It used to be better before. Ilias had supported the radical-left party Syriza, believing it would say no to further cuts. TRANSLATION: I believed in Syriza, I voted for them. I think Syriza betrayed its friends and its ideas. It did a 180-degrees turn. Elsewhere in the capital, the mood was different. Greece had secured its future in Europe. We are happy because we think this is going to bring stability to the country. We want to be in the euro, and now we are 100% sure we are with the Europeans, and Ifeel much more secure at the moment and relieved. But the deal is controversial. The government has to identify 50 billion euros of valuable publicly owned assets like ports, and then transfer them to a special fund to be privatised. It will be managed by Greece but supervised by outsiders. People’s lives here will change. Early retirement will end. VAT will go up on many food items. Sunday trading will be allowed, and trade unions weakened. Even some cabinet ministers are struggling to accept this. There was forced agreement, under tremendous political pressure and the imminent threat of the death of the economy due to the closure of the banks. Did Greece surrender? No, we survived. The minister told me that the Europe of austerity had won. The Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has arrived back in Athens. His next challenge is to get Parliament to agree to the new measures by Wednesday, and so unlock negotiations towards a third bailout. Almost certainly, the raft of new measures, the tax increases, the pension reforms, will be approved by the Parliament. But the Prime Minister will have to rely on the support of other parties, raising questions as to whether in the long term these measures will be fully implemented. At least we will have the potential for confidence to return. But this will take time, and of course a lot will depend on the banking sector and how quickly banks will reopen. Even though there is widespread relief that Greece is staying in the euro, many here say too much sovereignty has been surrendered. Gavin Hewitt, BBC News. There are growing expectations that a comprehensive deal on Iran’s nuclear programme will be announced in Vienna. Six world powers and Iran are reported to have drawn up a 100-page document listing restrictions on Iran’s nuclear activity and easing of sanctions. What’s being described as a ""comprehensive meeting"" is scheduled for 8 o’clock GMT. Earlier, our Chief International Correspondent, Lyse Doucet, sent this update from outside the hotel where the talks are taking place. All the world’s media have been camped out here for weeks, waiting for the negotiators who have been huddled inside. Some negotiators telling us that they didn’t leave the hotel at all, except for a one-day dash to their capitals. And in these last hours, there is a real sense now that it is almost, almost within reach. And I know that is a phrase that has been used a lot, but we sense different things. For example, they are discussing the logistics of an announcement tomorrow, the buses which would take the journalists, the interviews that would happen. The discussion and the mood are definitely different, but there is still that caution. It is not there yet. There are still some talks that need to take place, and we’re eyeing those balconies, just to see who comes out and who stays long into the night. Vali Nasr, a former senior advisor at the State Department, said both sides had been held back by domestic politics. I think the technicalities of the deal are easy to resolve. What keeps this deal from being concluded is politics at home. I think what holds the hands of both sides at the negotiating table is that they are worried about how a particular item is going to be construed back home. And it is also tough selling Iran as well, not necessarily with the public, but with the establishment. Both sides are trying to go home with a deal they can sell. A manhunt’s under way for one of Mexico’s most notorious drug lords. joaquin Guzman, who’s also known as El Chapo or ""Shorty"", escaped from a top security prison on Saturday night. It’s the second time he’s done so. Guzman is the leader of the feared Sinaloa cartel. Mexico’s government offered on a $3.8 million reward for his capture. Our Mexico correspondent juan Paullier reports. The search is on. Hundreds of police officers and soldiers are involved in the man-hunt. El Chapo is again Mexico’s most-wanted man. One of the most powerful and richest drug lords in the world, he was in charge of smuggling cocaine, marijuana and methamphetamine into the United States. He escaped using a very long and sophisticated tunnel, with ventilation and stairs. Authorities on Sunday inspected the tunnel opening inside this house, close to the prison. It was an incredible and well-planned escape. He wasjailed in Altiplano Prison, the most secure in the country, located 90 kilometres west of the capital. His escape was discovered when officers checked his cell, and found a hole ten metres deep which led to the tunnel. It was 1.5 kilometres long, and 1.7 metres high. Police are conducting a man-hunt in Sinaloa, his hometown, and they are searching in other Mexican states. But authorities in Guatemala are in high alert as well, as there is the possibility he may have crossed the border. More than 30 prison employees have been questioned. Some people here believe that El Chapo is too powerful, and fear what will happen next. TRANSLATION: He is taunting the government. He is laughing at them. He can do what he wants. I am not going to lie, that is what I think of him. You’ve got the power. The escape is a huge embarrassment to the government. The Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, in France on a state visit, said he was deeply shocked, and ordered an investigation. Authorities say they are doing everything they can to recapture El Chapo, but it won’t be an easy task. Stay with us on BBC News, still to come: The endangered polo ponies of Manipur. We have a special report from the tiny Indian state where the sport began. The flamboyant Italian fashion designer Gianni Versace has been shot dead in Florida. The multimillionaire was gunned down outside his home in the exclusive South Beach district of Miami. Emergency services across central Europe are stepping up their efforts to contain the worst floods this century. Nearly 100 people have been killed. Broadway is traditionally called the Great White Way by Americans but tonight it is completely blacked out. It’s a timely reminder to all Americans of the problems that the energy crisis has brought to them. 200 years ago today, a huge Parisian crowd stormed the Bastille prison, the first act of the Revolution which was to topple the French monarchy. Today, hundreds of thousands thronged the Champs Elysees for the traditional military parade. Finally, fairy penguins have been staggering ashore and collapsing after gorging themselves on a huge shoal their favourite food, pilchards. Some had eaten so much they could barely stand. This is BBC News. I’m Gavin Grey. The latest headlines: The Greek Prime Minister is facing resistance in Athens to sweeping new austerity measures he agreed to introduce in exchange for a new bailout. Representatives of six world powers and Iran are still working on a deal OI’l Let’s return to our main story now, Andrew Apostolu, is an economics historian and author, who has written extensively on Greece’s financial problems, and about failed economies. He says it’s still not certain the bail-out package will be passed by the Greek parliament. The problem is, Alexis Tsipras has always had to betray the voters. He had to betray them injanuary by promising what he could not give and then he got the referendum backing. He is now going back on what he said he wouldn’t do so he is in a tight spot. He will have the support of the opposition parties who he has successfully destroyed in the elections. They will probably give him enough votes to get through but there is a fundamental problem here. What Alexis Tsipras is doing is saying to the creditors, I am serious, but then he’s winking at the Greek people and saying, I am not serious, I’m not going to do this and you cannot pull off that trick forever. He may pull it off long enough for liquidity to return to the banks so they can reopen as it is shocking how long they have been closed in Greece but if he can’t, they are an even bigger trouble than they are now. That lack of trust, saying one thing in winking to the Greek people with the other, that is really what took so many European leaders by alarm but now that this has all been put forward, how will Greece and ordinary Greeks cope with these reforms? Greek society is coping horribly and any country would do in the same circumstances. Incomes are down by roughly 40% on average. That means there are people who have had half or more of their income taken away and I could not cope with that. It is a very difficult situation and the problem is Greece does not have the institutions that can implement reforms. A simple example, Greece doesn’t even have a land registry. They started a project to start one in 1994. They still haven’t finished. They say they will finish in 2020. That his 26 years to do a land registry. That is ridiculous and the fact is you can’t have a proper land registry, if you can’t, you won’t have success with austerity. So they can’t or won’t? It is a mixture of both. Alexis Tsipras suspended privatization and has now agreed to 50 billion euros of it. That was the goal Greece had originally agreed to in 2010 and they didn’t get anywhere near it, they did 3 billion. So he can’t do it but also, he won’t do it. There is a problem. And lack of political will. The fact is after 1974, Greece needed to build institutions after the Greek dictatorship and they did not do so. Elting institutions takes generations, often decades, sometimes many years and Greece has thrown that time away. There is no way they can do this in the short time allowed. Two journalists are due to go on trial in Thailand, charged with defaming the navy. Alan Morison, the Australian editor of the Phuket-based news website Phuketwan, and Chutima Sidasathian, one of his Thai reporters, are facing up to seven years in prison. The charges relate to a single paragraph republished on their website from a Reuters report on Rohingya refugees. Alan Morison told us he would fight the charges. We are seriously concerned but the principles are pretty clear. I’ve been a journalist for 15 years and freedom of the press is a bright everywhere. My father didn’t go to war for the everywhere. My father didn’t go to warfor the military, he went everywhere. My father didn’t go to war for the military, he went for democracy so we are fighting -- a right. NASA say a spacecraft launched nine years ago is on schedule to fly past Pluto later on Tuesday. The New Horizon will take pictures and collect data from the dwarf planet. Here’s our science reporter Rebecca Morelle. A mysterious world, slowly coming into view. These are the latest images captured by New Horizons as it closes in on Pluto. But they are nothing compared to what we will see after the flyby. We’ve now visited every planet in our solar system, but not Pluto. It’s a place we know almost nothing about. In my view, we are going to think it through for the first time. I like to think you often hear that a space mission is going to rewrite the textbooks because it has such a powerful impact on what we know. In this case we are real writing the textbook essentially from scratch. NASA’s probe blasted off in 2006. It has hurtled nearly 5 billion kilometres to the distant edge of the solar system. While the journey has been smooth, poor Pluto has had a more turbulent time. It was controversially demoted from planet to dwarf world, but that doesn’t make its exploration any less thrilling. Here at New Horizons mission HQ, scientists have been waiting patiently for this moment for nearly a decade, and now the stage is finally set for the spacecraft’s arrival, and we’ve been promised the pictures it will send back should be spectacular. And this is vital because Pluto’s home is where all eyes are trained. The Kuiper Belt a vast disc of space once thought empty but scientists now believe it holds hundreds of thousands of icy worlds, comets and space rocks, debris from the turbulence birth of our solar system 4.6 billion years ago. It’s the first time we will ever see, directly, anything in the Kuiper Belt up close. At the moment, the Kuiper Belt is only something we study with telescopes. We’ve never had a mission pass through there, so it’s a kind of unexplored frontier of the solar system. Until now, artists’ renderings of Pluto have been drawn entirely from the imagination, but, on Wednesday, the first close-up pictures from the flyby should arrive home, at last revealing this hidden world. Here in the UK, Prince William has begun work as an air ambulance pilot. He’s now based at Cambridge airport and will be flying with the East Anglian Air Ambulance service. Our royal correspondent, Nicholas Witchell was there as he took off for his first shift. just want to say very, very happy to be here. First day - nerves! It’s a job he’s chosen to do, and which is hugely important to him - working shifts as an air ambulance pilot, something William regards as both a duty and a necessity. For me, it’s also a really important point to be grounded, and Ifeel doing a job like this really helps with grounding the core of what I’m sort of trying to become. What is that? What are you trying to become? That’s a very good question! I thinkjust, you know, trying to be a good guy, trying to do what you can and trying to be, you know, a decent individual, thoughtful. All those sorts of things, qualities in people that you would want to be associated with. His air ambulance role will be William’s primary occupation. His royal duties will take second place. That seems to suit him. At some point there’s probably going to be a lot more pressure and responsibility from the other side of my life. At the moment I’m juggling the two of them and a young family and I’m enjoying it and I like the challenge. But, yes, inevitably down the line, things will probably become a little bit more difficult for me to do that. And what of that young family? What impact has the arrival of Charlotte had? It’s been obviously fantastic and she’s been a little joy of heaven. But at the same time, it is more responsibility, looking after two little ones, especially when George is around - he’s a little monkey! But it’s fantastic having a lovely family and I’m so thrilled and Catherine has been doing an amazing job as a mother and I’m very proud of her. They now have a son and a daughter, so any plans for more children? We’ve onlyjust had the second one! You never know what’s going to happen in the future. William, juggling family life and a dual sense of duty as a prince and as a pilot. Nicholas Witchell, BBC News, Cambridge Airport. The game of Polo is often referred to as the Game of Kings. It’s popular all over the world but its origins are in the tiny Indian state of Manipur. The game is still popular there, mainly due to the ponies of Manipur. They are a rare breed and conservationists say they might even be endangered. Anbarasan Ethirajan reports from the capital of Manipur. ""You are not the beast of burden, nor the animal for ploughing the fields, but to fight in battle,"" says this song dedicated to the ponies of Manipur. For centuries, people here has been riding these ponies to play sagol kangjei, a predecessor of polo. Manipur ponies are semi-wild, one of five indigenous horse breeds of India. Known for their elegance, stamina and speed, these majestic animals are considered to be the original polo ponies. The modern version of polo is thought to have originated here in Manipur under British colonial rule, and the main reason is ponies like this one. The Manipuri pony is well adapted for the polo game. An exciting exciting polo game between two local clubs. Polo is a popular sport in Manipur, in fact even more popular than cricket. Not long ago, thousands of ponies trotted around the wetlands of Manipur. Now their numbers have drastically reduced to just around 500. From government projects, they have encroached and taken the natural habitat of all the Manipuri ponies. In fact the Manipur ponies used to live in the wild, in the wetlands of Manipur. Today there are very few wetlands in Manipur where they can live, which is their homeland. With very little land, Manipuri ponies resort of foraging from garbage in surrounding towns and cities. This can have lethal consequences as polythene bags and harmful waste can kill them. These animals are now relying on the polo game for their survival as they are no longer supported by villagers and farmers. But the government has initiated some programmes to preserve this species. Without a massive conservation attempt, Manipur ponies face the danger of becoming extinct. A reminder of our top story. The Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, is facing growing opposition in Athens to sweeping new austerity measures he agreed to in order to introduce an exchange for new bailout. This is BBC News. Hi there. Yesterday was, well, a pretty dismal day for many of us. A lot of low cloud, outbreaks of rain pushing eastwards across the country, thanks to an area of low pressure. Low pressure formed another weather front that stretches 2,500 miles into the Atlantic. As that low pressure now affects Europe, the next one will come in for Tuesday and this bump will bring more damp weather. More rain on the way for some of us towards the end of the week. Overnight tonight, It will be pretty cloudy across England and Wales with mist and fog around the coasts and hills. Outbreaks of light rain and drizzle and feeling very humid, especially across East Anglia with temperatures of 17. A fresher feel for Northern Ireland and Scotland. Tuesday will be another cloudy and damp day, particularly for England and Wales. There will be drizzle to start and it will be misty and murky across the Brecon Beacons and the moors of southwest England with fog on the hills. The cloud could thicken enough to bring a few spots of rain across the Midlands but moving northwards, generally we are looking at a drier and brighter start to the day, especially across parts of Scotland where you have a decent chance of seeing early morning sunshine. Through the rest of the day, the drizzle will tend to ease off across central and eastern parts of England as we head through the latter part of the morning. But later in the afternoon, the cloud will re-thicken and we will see drizzle extending its way eastwards from Wales and south-west England towards more eastern counties of England as we end the day. Further north, we could see rain for a short time across north-west England, but in Scotland it will be bright with sunny spells. A few showers in the east. Wednesday, although it starts off cloudy, many of us will see some sunshine during Wednesday afternoon across the south. There will be one or two heavy showers on Wednesday that it will be warmer and in London temperatures could reach 24 degrees and it will feel pretty humid. The third of our low pressures rocks up on Thursday and Friday, bringing outbreaks of rain to Northern Ireland on Thursday with strengthening winds off the Irish Sea. These south-easterly winds will be pulling in warm air from the Continent. Temperatures on the face of it, could reach 25 in London. We could see temperatures climbing into the high 20s depending on how much sunshine we get and how much cloud there is in the sky as well. By Friday, the low pressure will have moved to the north and west, so we will see outbreaks of rain with potentially gale-force winds on the coast, and outbreaks of rain for Scotland. Still holding onto some warm weather across southeastern counties of England. That’s your forecast. The headlines on BBC News: The Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is meeting ministers in Athens, after agreeing sweeping new austerity measures in return for a third international bailout, which came with strict conditions. The deal requires Greece to approve tax rises, pension cuts, and changes to employment laws by Wednesday. Six world powers, including the United States, Russia, and Britain, have been negotiating with Tehran for 17 days about scaling down its nuclear activities in return for the lifting of some economic sanctions. The latest deadline for reaching a deal hasjust passed. Mexico’s government have offered a $3.8 million reward for the capture of fugitive drug lord joaquin ‘El Chapo’ Guzman, who broke out from prison at the weekend. The US has pledged to help Mexico recapture the twice-escaped drug kingpin. Coming up next is Reporters. Hello and welcome to Reporters. From here in the world’s newsroom, we send out correspondents to bring you the best stories from across the globe. In this week’s programme, catching Brazil’s illegal loggers. How the fight to preserve the Amazon rainforest has become a battle against organised crime. They tie a huge chain between two tractors and the tractors then drag the chain across the field and they fell everything in its path. All that’s left here are a few tree trunks. The children of Gaza one year on from the conflict. We meet the youngsters still bearing the scars of war. Ending extreme poverty in Africa: We report from Uganda on whether the UN’s development goals can be achieved. The pledge, this year’s new global push to end poverty, is that nobody should be left behind. It clearly can’t be just a slogan. China’s forgotten war. We meet some of the unsung heroes of Asia’s bloodiest 20th-century conflict. And business is blooming. We discover that tulips don’t have to come from Amsterdam. What makes this system so competitive is that these flowers go straight to the shops. There is no middle man. Is Brazil doing enough to protect the Amazon rainforest? At a summit in Washington last month, President Dilma Rousseff defended her government’s environmental record and pledged to eliminate illegal logging. The BBC has seen evidence that suggests after years of progress, deforestation of the Amazon is again on the rise as the Brazilian government drastically cuts budgets for environmental protection. We travelled to the Amazon’s protected Indigenous reserves where much of the illegal logging is taking place. Guns drawn over the rainforest. The Amazon is yet again the front line between Brazil’s environmental police and those who see this vast wilderness as a resource there for the taking. In recent years, Brazil has significantly reduced deforestation rates, but we have seen figures that suggest illegal logging and the clearing of forest areas has risen sharply. As budgets for environmental protection fall, Brazil’s government is arguably more focused on prioritising rural development. On the ground, agents take on the illegal loggers, detaining suspects and destroying their camps and equipment. The fight to save the Amazon is a fight against organised crime. TRANSLATION: You can compare it to the fight against drugs trafficking. The crime and the criminals keep adapting, getting more sophisticated, using even bigger tools, making it more dangerous for us. Satellite images help agents identify forest being illegaly destroyed. The pink area was, days ago, virginjungle. The destruction sometimes seems dangerous and egregious. In this case, huge fields of trees, acres of trees, are felled in a couple of days or weeks. They tie a huge chain between two tractors and the tractors then drag the chain across the field and they fell everything in its path. All that’s left here are a few tree trunks. New monthly figures from some parts of Brazil show that deforestation rates have almost doubled compared to last year. Those statistics also show that it’s from protected Indigenous reserves that increasing amounts of wood are being taken. These villagers from one tribe might have Western clothes and some modern amenities, but they mainly live off and in the forest. The forest and the people are being forgotten, says Amadeus. TRANSLATION: The loggers come here for the valuable hardwoods that have already been lost elsewhere. That’s why the pressure on our land is so strong. The desire to preserve tradition and identity is also strong. But some argue that, by restricting access to their territories, Brazil’s Indigenous people sometimes hold back their own progress and that of the country. Limited logging is permitted under licence, but in some areas it is thought that as much as 80% of the timber felled is done so illegally from state-owned or Indigenous land. This sawmill deals only in certified timber. Many others are less scrupulous. Valuable hardwoods are cut into decking and laminates for export. It also providesjobs in a region where 20 million people now live. But here they argue that only by placing a monetary value on the forest, allowing managed exploitation of the Amazon, including Indigenous areas, can the rainforest survive. TRANSLATION: I think people in the south of Brazil and in Europe and the US think the forest is untouchable. But they forget that there are people living here. So, we must find a way for them to live from the forest, get an income from it and give it a value. No country has done more than Brazil to reduce previous rampant levels of deforestation. But there is constant economic pressure from a growing population to make more from the Amazon. Until a workable plan is found that suits all sides, the future of this unique wilderness will remain unresolved. As if Greece didn’t have enough to cope with this week with its financial crisis, on the Greek island of Lesbos a population crisis is increasing. There has been a record rise in the number of migrants. 1,600 arrived in one day last weekend. It only has one refugee camp, and temporary ones, and one set up on a racetrack. They are failing to cope. Many are escaping Syria, but for many it’s not the dream of a better life many had hoped for. On the idyllic isle of Lesbos, here is where they welcome the refugees. Some say Syria was paradise compared to this. Najib is 24-years-old. I’ve been here forfour days. In Aleppo, I was feeling safe, but it was going away day by day, seeing people around getting killed, losing too many friends. And then getting bullets around me so many times. I survived by chance, and I couldn’t take more chances. Like so many of the 2,000 people now living here, he paid a smuggler to get him into Europe illegally. It’s a sewage swamp, actually. It’s a catastrophe for health. Can you describe the smell? The smell is like garbage, in general. You feel like there are dead bodies there. Actually, there are no dead bodies, but it smells like that. I have smelled it in Syria, and I can tell you it smells like that. At dawn, a navy ship patrols. The refugees set sail from Turkey, piling what was left of their hopes and possessions into an inflatable dinghy. Last month an average of 500 people a day made this voyage to Lesbos and the tide is swelling. Actually, it’s a very short way, so we hope to keep the Coast Guard’s number with us, so hopefully there are very few deaths. I know one is too many, but compared to other ways, this is the safest way. Here at the island’s only official reception centre, they can apply for temporary visas. There’s space for 700 people. The authorities are now dealing with more than four times that amount. And now, they’re pleading for painkillers, plasters for blisters, cream to heal a rash. The aid agency MSF is sending rapid response teams but they won’t arrive until next week. The most important treatment is to be treated as a human being. It’s hard to hold it together here. A year on from the war between Israeli forces and the Palestinian militant groups in Gaza, it’s the youngest who still bear some of the deepest scars. Save the Children says many continue to suffer nightmares and flashbacks and need emotional counselling. We have been speaking to some of those most affected, including one 12-year-old boy who survived a defining moment of the war. Some of the joys of childhood have returned to the lives of young Gazans, but some have gone forever for children like 12-year-old Sayed. The last time they went to the beach to play became one of the most harrowing moments of the war. EXPLOSION. Israel says its air force mistook the children for Hamas fighters. Sayed’s brother and three cousins were buried that day. In all, more than 500 children were killed in last year’s conflict. The UN says both Israeli forces and Palestinian militant groups may have committed war crimes. Many children also lost loved ones, lost their homes. Sayed still lives in his family’s small flat, not far from the beach. But his mother says he’s not the same boy. Sayed dropped out of school. It reminds him of his brother. His father takes him out on his fishing boat. Their family has lived off the sea for generations. But Sayed no longer feels safe here. Sayed is one of some 400,000 Gazan children the UN says needs counselling. He’s getting some help but not enough. He and three cousins, who survived the beach attack, are all deeply scarred. One tried to kill himself. Another almost killed someone else. Say goodbye to these strong men, they sing, of the four boys who died that day on the beach. They ask, who says that scars heal and pain gets any easier? The plight of children across the world has been highlighted by the United Nations this week. The UN children’s agency, Unicef, says that despite significant achievements, millions of children still live in poverty and dying before they turn five. In order to force the pace of development, some African countries set up so-called millennium villages ten years ago as models for change. We have visited one of these villages in Uganda to see its impact. A courteous goodbye to her father. It’s still before seven, and the 12-year-old has a 45-minute walk to her school. When all the pupils at the 580-strong primary school have arrived, they are summoned on parade for the morning’s rituals. Rona and her schoolmates carry with them the hopes of thousands of impoverished homes across Rohira. Her parents tell me of the struggle to make ends meet with the fees they’ve had to pay to keep their seven children in school. TRANSLATION: Often my children are in need of shoes but I can’t afford to buy them. I don’t even own a bicycle. How could I buy a bicycle when I can’t afford to buy shoes? Can you see a time when you will be less poor, or is that something your children will experience? I don’t think we will ever get less poor than we are today, except if God blesses the children we have. They are the ones we hope will have a better future. Back at the school, the computer room running on solar power, the most stark change since I was last here five years ago. Food provided for children at these local schools is still intended to help keep them from dropping out but parents are increasingly being asked to contribute. At this primary school, clearly poorer parents are about to be asked help save this precarious block of classrooms. These are risky. This is worse. Rains coming. These are not so strong, and we’re worried. The existing landscape of aid and development in Africa is being challenged, particularly by rapidly-growing investment. One of the aims of this Millennium Village project is that the community get more value out of their cash crops. This farmer’s coffee has helped him build a new house. Economic growth may one day change the lives of everyone here in Rohira, but it will take much more than that. Aid can come in and help enhance the development, but it is not the key aspect. It is the change of the mind, understanding what they have and taking advantage of what potential they have to change their own lives. Reporting on Africa over many years, I’ve seen aid initiatives come and go. The lesson is obvious, there is no simple formula for eradicating poverty and reducing inequality. Alongside the successes there are invariably setbacks. The pledge of this is new global push for ending poverty is that no-one can be left behind. It must be more than a slogan if it is to mean anything to the future of millions of children across Africa. Commemorations were held this week to mark 70 years since the biggest war in Asia in the 20th century. The Second Sino-japanese War began when Chinese and japanese troops began an exchange of fire that soon escalated into a full-scale battle. It escalated into the Second World War and changed the history of China and the world. Cindy Sui reports on why so little is known in the rest of the world on a conflict that had such profound ramifications. A solemn national anthem and thundering cannon fire, fitting remembrances of the bloodiest war ever fought in China. But it’s one that’s often overlooked by the world. For China, the Second World War started in 1937, more than four years before the US entered it. japan had invaded the country to gain access to raw materials and control of the Asia-Pacific region. As many as 23 million Chinese people died in the japanese invasion of China during World War II. That accounts for about one third of the total number of people killed during the war. Yet few people in the world know about this period of history. The Republic of China and Taiwan wants this ceremony to remind the world of the sacrifices made by the soldiers and the people. Only a few soldiers who survived are still alive, and most of them are in their90s. Tao Shih-jun was a 19-year-old farmer’s son, who became an Army medic and saw many soldiers wounded and killed. TRANSLATION: Back then we were outnumbered and poorly equipped. We didn’t even have enough basic supplies. We had to keep using the same bandages for months and lacked painkillers. The wounded soldiers would scream in pain. When I think about the past, I want to cry. Like many of the veterans, he lost not only lost his comrades, but also family members. He believes his parents are among those killed. He later witnessed japan’s surrender. TRNASLATION: I felt sorry for the japanese soldiers because it’s hard to lose a war. But that did not reduce the hate inside me at the time. They killed my parents, they invaded us, we had to fight back. Many historians say that had the war not happened, China and the world would have experienced a very different history. TRANSLATION: The war interrupted a process of modernisation and democratisation in China and helped the communists eventually take over the country. By putting up long resistance, China kept millions ofjapanese preoccupied and prevented japan invading other countries. Many of those who fought the japanese in China later fled to Taiwan with their government after losing a civil war with the communists. Each day, guards at the Martyrs’ Shrine pay their respects to those killed. Decades after the war, the people who lost so much because of the war prefer not to think of what might have been, but to cherish peace instead. Finally, flower power has gone global. Tulips have long been a source of pride and profit for Dutch flower growers, but these days the springtime attraction is popping up all over the world. Global demand means it’s often cheaper to grow the flowers in places like Colombia, Kenya and the United States than it is to ship them from the Netherlands. jane O’brian has been to America to find business is blooming. Dick Varnaster tiptoes through the tulip fields his family has owned for more than a century. His business is part of Holland’s multimillion-dollar flower industry, but times are changing. -- His business is part of Holland’s multibillion-dollar flower industry, It’s difficult because taxes are bigger. You are trying to manage lots of rules from the government. It’s not so easy anymore. Worldwide demand for cheap flowers all year long is growing and other countries are muscling in. Small Dutch farmers who work with the seasons and the soil are under pressure. But there is a way to keep business blooming. This 46-acre greenhouse is probably the world’s biggest tulip factory. It’s owned by a Dutch company and uses Dutch technology but it’s in Virginia. 100 million tulips are grown in these hydroponic beds every year. The bulbs are brought in from the Netherlands, but after that they are grown and sold in America. We see a lot of possibilities in local production. Since we are producing locally, the transit time to the customer and final consumer is far shorter. It is way better compare than a product that has to travel all -- It is way better compared to a product that has to travel all over the world to come to the local market. The vast majority of flowers in the US are imported by dealers, but these tulips are sold direct to stores - a business model that shortens the supply chain and keeps flowers fresher. At peak production, more than 600,000 tulips are put into bunches every single day. Obviously they have slowed it down so I can do it, but what makes this system so competitive is that these flowers go straight into the shops. There is no middle man. Back in the Netherlands, the annual flower parade is a celebration of an industry that shows little sign of wilting. Experts say Dutch expansion abroad is the key. A lot of companies doing it in the US are Dutch-origin companies. They have to pay their taxes there but the profits are coming back to Holland. The flowers on these floats were all grown in the Netherlands, but one day they may come from Dutch growers in the US. That’s all from Reporters this week. Goodbye for now. Hi there. Yesterday was, well, a pretty dismal day for many of us. A lot of low cloud, outbreaks of rain pushing eastwards across the country, thanks to an area of low pressure. Low pressure formed another weather front that stretches 2,500 miles into the Atlantic. As that low pressure now affects Europe, the next one will come in for Tuesday and this bump will bring more damp weather. More rain on the way for some of us towards the end of the week. Overnight tonight, It will be pretty cloudy across England and Wales with mist and fog around the coasts and hills. Outbreaks of light rain and drizzle and feeling very humid, especially across East Anglia with temperatures of 17. A fresher feel for Northern Ireland and Scotland. Tuesday will be another cloudy and damp day, particularly for England and Wales. There will be drizzle to start and it will be misty and murky across the Brecon Beacons and the moors of southwest England with fog on the hills. The cloud could thicken enough to bring a few spots of rain across the Midlands but moving northwards, generally we are looking at a drier and brighter start to the day, especially across parts of Scotland where you have a decent chance of seeing early morning sunshine. Through the rest of the day, the drizzle will tend to ease off across central and eastern parts of England as we head through the latter part of the morning. But later in the afternoon, the cloud will re-thicken and we will see drizzle extending its way eastwards from Wales and south-west England towards more eastern counties of England as we end the day. Further north, we could see rain for a short time across north-west England, but in Scotland it will be bright with sunny spells. A few showers in the east. Wednesday, although it starts off cloudy, many of us will see some sunshine during Wednesday afternoon across the south. There will be one or two heavy showers on Wednesday that it will be warmer and in London temperatures could reach 24 degrees and it will feel pretty humid. The third of our low pressures rocks up on Thursday and Friday, bringing outbreaks of rain to Northern Ireland on Thursday with strengthening winds off the Irish Sea. These south-easterly winds will be pulling in warm air from the Continent. Temperatures on the face of it, could reach 25 in London. We could see temperatures climbing into the high 20s depending on how much sunshine we get and how much cloud there is in the sky as well. By Friday, the low pressure will have moved to the north and west, so we will see outbreaks of rain with potentially gale-force winds on the coast, and outbreaks of rain for Scotland. Still holding onto some warm weather across southeastern counties of England. That’s your forecast.

I feel doing a job like this helps with sort of grounding the core of what I’m trying to become. Hello. The Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is facing growing opposition in Athens to the new austerity measures he has agreed to in exchange for a new bailout. Underthe plan, Greece will get a third bailout, but only if it signs up to stringent new reforms in the next few days. There will be a short-term loan to keep the country solvent and allow the banks to reopen. In return, parliament must agree the extensive reforms demanded by European creditors. That would pave the way for a third bailout in five years, of 86 billion euros. We start our coverage with this report from our Europe editor Katya Adler. It was a long, long night, billed as the last chance for a deal on Greece. EU hacks are used to last-minute late-night deals, not ones stretching through till breakfast time. Talks nearly collapsed altogether. Eurozone leaders were on a knife-edge. Don’t be fooled by this smile. The Greek Prime Minister had very few friends here. Trust in his government is at an all-time low, following months of backtracking and insults. After 15 hours of arguments, he and the hardline German Chancellor reached an impasse. The two leaders threatened to walk out. Pulled back from the brink, a weary-looking Chancellor Merkel assured doubters this morning she is now on board with the Greece deal. TRANSLATION: The situation is tense, so it’s in everyone’s interest to make the next steps work. If the Greek parliament does its bit, trust can be regained. But conditions imposed on Greeks are harsh. Their Prime Minister had promised an end to what he called creditor-imposed humiliation. He knows he will struggle to sell this deal at home. ""The deal is difficult,"" he said, ""but we have avoided financial ""asphyxiation and the collapse of the financial system. ""We fought as hard as we could."" So, what next? To rebuild trust, the Greek Parliament is expected to pass VAT, tax and pension reforms this week. Eurozone finance ministers are working out an interim agreement to keep Greek banks afloat and debt repayment honoured. Worth an estimated 80 billion euros, the new bailout will be spread over three years, starting late summer, if all those involved can agree. There are a lot of ifs involved here. This was no glorious victory, for Greece or its eurozone partners. Sure, they arrived bleary-eyed this morning with their we-did-it message. But don’t forget, today’s deal is about sitting down at a later date to hammer out those details. And as for reducing Greece’s crippling debt, that has been put on the backburner again. So, today’s agreement does not solve the Greek crisis in the long term, and serious rifts between eurozone countries have been exposed, not just with Greece, but between EU powers Germany, and a more conciliatory France. The French President said a compromise on Greece was necessary for EU unity. TRANSLATION: Today was a long negotiation, but above all, a historic decision, because if Greece had left the eurozone, what would have been said? That the eurozone wasn’t able to ensure its integrity and its solidarity? The eurozone would have gone backwards when it needs to go forwards. What leaders wanted more than anything here was to restore trust in the wider eurozone, and there a victory has been achieved. After months of speculation, talk of Greece falling out of the single currency has gone, for now. The deal has had a mixed reception in Greece. Our chief correspondent Gavin Hewitt reports from Athens. Petralona, an Athens neighbourhood that supported Alexis Tsipras in his stand against austerity. They woke to a deal that kept Greece in the euro. But here, there was more bewilderment than celebration. TRANSLATION: The country cannot bear these reform measures. It’s going to become even more poor. You can see for yourself, watch around. It used to be better before. Ilias had supported the radical-left party Syriza, believing it would say no to further cuts. TRANSLATION: I believed in Syriza, I voted for them. I think Syriza betrayed its friends and its ideas. It did a 180-degrees turn. Elsewhere in the capital, the mood was different. Greece had secured its future in Europe. We’re happy because we think that this is going to bring stability to the country. We want to be in the euro, and now we are 100% sure we are with the Europeans, and Ifeel much more secure at the moment and relieved. But the deal is controversial. The government has to identify 50 billion euros of valuable publicly owned assets, like ports, and then transfer them to a special fund to be privatised. It will be managed by Greece but supervised by outsiders. People’s lives here will change. Early retirement will end. VAT will go up on many food items. Sunday trading will be allowed, and trade unions weakened. Even some cabinet ministers are struggling to accept this. It was a forced agreement, under tremendous political pressure, and the imminent threat of the death of the economy due to the closure of the banks. Did Greece surrender? No, we survived. The minister told me that the Europe of austerity had won. The Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has arrived back in Athens. His next challenge is to get Parliament to agree to the new measures by Wednesday, and so unlock negotiations towards a third bailout. Almost certainly the raft of new measures, the tax increases, the pension reforms, will be approved by the Parliament. But the Prime Minister will have to rely on the support of other parties, raising questions as to whether in the long term these measures will be fully implemented. At least we will have the potential for confidence to return. But this will take time, and of course a lot will depend on the banking sector, and how quickly banks will reopen. Even though there is widespread relief that Greece is staying in the euro, many here say too much sovereignty has been surrendered. There are growing expectations that a comprehensive deal on Iran’s nuclear programme will be announced in Vienna. What is being described as a comprehensive meeting is scheduled in just a few hours. Earlier, our chief international correspondent Lyse Doucet sent this update from outside the hotel where the talks are taking place. All the world’s media have been camped out here for weeks, waiting for the negotiators who have been huddled inside. Some of the negotiators telling us that they didn’t leave the hotel at all, except for a one-day dash to their capitals. And in these last hours, there is a real sense now that it is almost, almost within reach. And I know that is a phrase that has been used a lot, but we sense different things. For example, they are discussing the logistics of an announcement tomorrow, they’re discussing the buses which would take the journalists, the interviews that would happen. The discussion and the mood are definitely different, but there is still that caution. It is not there yet. There are still some talks that need to take place, and we’re eyeing those balconies, just to see who comes out and who stays long into the night. Vali Nasr, a former senior advisor at the state department, said both sides had been held back by domestic politics. I think the technicalities of the deal are easy to resolve. What keeps this deal from being concluded is politics at home. I think what holds the hands of both sides at the negotiating table is that they are worried about how a particular item is going to be construed back home. And it is also tough selling Iran too, and not necessarily with the public, but with parliament and with the establishment. Both sides are trying to go home with a deal they can sell. Let’s round-up some of the other main stories: New York City has agreed to pay $5.9 million to the family of Eric Garner, who died after a violent arrest in 2014. The arrest was captured on video and showed a police officer putting Garner in a neck hold, wrestle him to the ground, and then restrain him by force. Mr Garner’s death sparked protests across the US. The government in Mexico is offering a reward of nearly $4 million for the capture of the country’s most-wanted drug lord, who is missing from a top-security prison. A huge manhunt is under way forjoaquin Guzman, also known as Shorty, who escaped from his cell through a tunnel. There has been rioting in Belfast, as police tried to prevent a Protestant Orange Order parade from entering a nationalist area of the city. At least eight officers were injured after being pelted with rocks and bottles. A 16-year-old girl was taken to hospital after being hit by a car. The US military is considering a plan that would allow transgender people to serve openly in the armed forces. US defence secretary Ash Carter said that the current ban is outdated. Over the next six months, a group will study whether lifting the ban will adversely affect the military. A spacecraft that has travelled three billion miles in ten years has almost reached its destination, Pluto. The New Horizons probe is flying past the dwarf planet at 30,000 miles per hour, gathering information which could transform our understanding of the far reaches of the Solar System. Here is our science reporter Rebecca Morelle. A mysterious world, slowly coming into view. These are the latest images captured by New Horizons as it closes in on Pluto. But they are nothing compared to what we will see after the flyby. We’ve now visited every planet in our solar system, but not Pluto. It is a place we know almost nothing about. We’re not going to rethink our understanding. In my view, we are going to think it through for the first time. I like to think you often hear that a space mission is going to rewrite the textbooks because it has such a powerful impact on what we know. In this case we are real writing the textbook essentially from scratch. Nasa’s probe blasted off in 2006. It has hurtled nearly 5 billion kilometres to the distant edge of the solar system. While the journey has been smooth, poor Pluto has had a more turbulent time. It was controversially demoted from a planet to a dwarf world, but that doesn’t make its exploration any less thrilling. Here at New Horizons mission HQ, scientists have been waiting patiently for this moment for nearly a decade, and now the stage is finally set for the spacecraft’s arrival, and we’ve been promised the pictures it will send back should be spectacular. And this is vital, because Pluto’s home the Kuiper Belt is where all eyes are trained. It is a vast disc of space once thought empty but scientists now believe it holds hundreds of thousands of icy worlds, comets and space rocks, debris from the turbulence birth of our solar system 4.6 billion years ago. It’s the first time we’ll ever see, directly, anything in the Kuiper Belt up close. I mean, at the moment, Kuiper Belt is only something we study with telescopes. We’ve never had a mission pass through there, so it’s a kind of unexplored frontier of the solar system. Until now, artists’ renderings of Pluto have been drawn entirely from the imagination. But, on Wednesday, the first close-up pictures from the fly- by should arrive home, at last revealing this hidden world. Stay with us on BBC News.

The latest headlines: The Greek Prime Minister is facing resistance in Athens to sweeping new austerity measures he agreed to introduce in exchange for a new bailout. Representatives of six world powers and Iran are still working on a deal OI’l The UN Secretary General is calling on world leaders to put aside what he called narrow self-interest in funding the UN’s latest development agenda. Ban Ki-Moon was speaking on the first day of a major development summit in Ethiopia. Andrew Harding reports on Ethiopia’s economic rebound, 30 years since the Live Aid charity concert drew attention to the nation’s plight. Addis Ababa, Ethiopia’s high altitude capital and the heart of what may now be the world’s fastest-growing economy. By some 10% a year now, a staggering change from the bad old days. Bob Geldof, he knows about drink and wine... Even the man behind Live Aid famine relief three decades ago is now investing in the local wine industry. Things have tremendously changed, fast, quick, sometimes even I cannot believe the things I see today is changing the next month so I am seeing the country is being built. The country is getting built. In 1984, perhaps a million people starved to death in the north of the country. Today, the droughts continue here but irrigation and proper planning are making a visible difference. This one-year-old is severely malnourished but he is a rare case now, and he’s getting measured and no doubt saved at this brand-new hospital, built with British money. What is most striking is the attitude of local doctors, foreign aid is appreciated but they don’t want it for much longer. We are trying to make it ourselves, I hope in five or ten years we will have our own health facilities. You won’t need outside help anymore? Yeah. So that’s the aim? That’s the aim, yeah, we should support ourselves. But if poverty is falling fast here, there are 25 million people in need. Outside help still has a role. This farmer has no land of his own, his family stalked by hunger, but Britain’s £300 million annual aid package for Ethiopia helps pay him a wage for working on building projects that benefit the whole community. It works here more than anything anywhere else I’ve seen. This is probably the most exciting programme I’ve worked on in my life. Because it gets results? It gets huge results. There are still parts of Africa where the business of foreign aid seems endless and almost hopeless, but not here. Ethiopia’s government is very authoritarian but it’s also hugely ambitious, determined to fight poverty and to wean itself off foreign aid. Food for thought for the rest of the continent and for those arguing about aid, development and how best to help. Here in the UK, Prince William has begun work as an air ambulance pilot. He’s now based at Cambridge airport and will be flying with the East Anglian Air Ambulance service. Our royal correspondent, Nicholas Witchell, was there as he took off for his first shift. just want to say very, very happy to be here. First day - nerves! It’s a job he’s chosen to do, and which is hugely important to him - working shifts as an air ambulance pilot, something William regards as both a duty and a necessity. For me, it’s also a really important point to be grounded, and Ifeel doing a job like this really helps with grounding the core of what I’m sort of trying to become. What is that? What are you trying to become? That’s a very good question! I thinkjust, you know, trying to be a good guy, trying to do what you can and trying to be, you know, a decent individual, thoughtful. All those sorts of things, qualities in people that you would want to be associated with. His air ambulance role will be William’s primary occupation. His royal duties will take second place. That seems to suit him. At some point there’s probably going to be a lot more pressure and responsibility from the other side of my life. At the moment I’m juggling the two of them and a young family and I’m enjoying it and I like the challenge. But, yes, inevitably down the line, things will probably become a little bit more difficult for me to do that. And what of that young family? What impact has the arrival of Charlotte had? It’s been obviously fantastic and she’s been a little joy of heaven. But at the same time, it is more responsibility, looking after two little ones, especially when George is around - he’s a little monkey! But it’s fantastic having a lovely family and I’m so thrilled and Catherine has been doing an amazing job as a mother and I’m very proud of her. They now have a son and a daughter, so any plans for more children? We’ve onlyjust had the second one! You never know what’s going to happen in the future. William, juggling family life and a dual sense of duty as a prince and as a pilot. Nicholas Witchell, BBC News, Cambridge Airport. Almost 60 years since it was written, the American author Harper’s Lee’s second novel Go Set A Watchman is going on sale around the world. These eagar fans stayed up until midnight at a bookshop in London in order to be one of the first to get their hands on the eagerly awaited book. This is Harper Lee’s second novel after her Pulitzer Prize-winning To Kill A Mockingbird was published in the 1960’s. Go Set A Watchman is an earlier version of the same story that repaints some of the classic novel’s heros in a less flattering light. That didn’t stop fans from keeping an open mind. I’m quite wary, I guess, of it changing my perception because characters that have meant so much to so many people are being drawn into question and that could be upsetting. I’ve gone into this with an open mind. I don’t feel like I have any expectations of anything. I think that we need to take this book as it was meant to be, on its own as its own work of art. Iran over here as soon as I saw it was being released and pre-ordered it straightaway. I have had this receipt in my pocket for the last three months waiting for it to come out. I thought I might as well come out at midnight and get it as soon as possible and just read it. Fans of Harper Lee there. This week, one of the biggest names in the toy business is closing its much loved Fifth Avenue location in Manhattan. FAO Schwarz has sold teddy bears and model trains from this iconic spot for more than three decades. The store’s leaving because of rising rents, a citywide problem. As Nada Tawfik reports, FAO Schwarz’s departure is leaving a hole in the hearts of New Yorkers and tourists alike. Eager faces await the opening of FAO Schwarz. just a few more chances to smile and pose with the real-life toy soldiers. The world’s most famous toy store has been the place of fantasies for nearly 30 years here. Who can forget Tom Hanks in the movie Big, playing Heart and Soul on the store’s big piano? The scene helped to raise the brand to worldwide prominence. But up against Fifth Avenue’s rising rents, playtime at this iconic location will soon be over. We have been bringing the grandchildren and the kids for many years to play with toys and the piano. Is sad to see it going. It is not like a normal toy store. It is like trying to find something that shows your personality and the personality of the store. It is a palace of toys, from handmade doll houses to a $1500 stuffed panda, there is plenty of unique options. My name is Stanley and I am a news anchor. Forjoe and Ryan it was a Muppet. FAO Schwarz’s Muppet workshop was the only place where they could customise their very own Muppet. I think the coolest thing is you could watch them put the puppet together and actually glue pieces on the face and do the hair and clothes. Watch it take place right in front of you. FAO Schwarz has been struggling with its business model for years, facing competition online and from cheap retailers. Yet other boutique toy stores have adapted and even thrived. In many cases parents are willing to spend more money. Take for example, this high-end doll store on Fifth Avenue. They found a way to not only sell the product but to cash in on the experience. American Girl Place gives customers an incentive to return, giving you the chance to get your doll’s ears pierced and hair done. You can even have a fancy lunch with your doll. It’s priceless because this experience is notjust going to Toys ""R"" Us or FAO Schwarz and buying something and leaving. It is a wining and dining experience with matching outfits and it is so cute. It is just a fun day for the kids. FAO Schwarz says it is committed to building on the legacy of the brand through a new flagship location in the city. Until then, New York will be a little less playful.

The headlines on BBC News: The Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is meeting ministers in Athens, after agreeing sweeping new austerity measures in return for a third international bailout, which came with strict conditions. The deal requires Greece to approve tax rises, pension cuts and changes to employment laws by Wednesday. Six world powers, including the United States, Russia, and Britain, have been negotiating with Tehran for 17 days about scaling down its nuclear activities in return for the lifting of some economic sanctions. The latest deadline for reaching a deal hasjust passed. A space probe is about to reach Pluto after a nine-year, 3-billion-mile journey. The New Horizons craft will take the very first close-up pictures of the dwarf planet since its discovery in 1930. Early measurements show that Pluto is probably bigger than previously thought. Now on BBC News it is time for HARDtalk. Welcome to HARDtalk, I’m Stephen Sackur. Ukraine is grappling with security and economic challenges that could bring the nation to its knees. The country needs a new generation of strong, reform-minded leaders. But does it need my guest today? He is Mikheil Saakashvili, the former president of neighbouring Georgia, recently appointed governor of Ukraine’s strategically vital Odessa region. He knows all about confrontation with Vladimir Putin. But is he a credible or wise addition to Ukraine’s hard-pressed government? Mikheil Saakashvili, welcomed the HARDtalk. Thank you, thank you for bringing me back in this new capacity. Well, a new capacity. On the face of it this is one of the most bizarre political appointments I can ever remember. You were a national president, now you are regional governor in somebody else’s country. What on earth is going on? Notjust another country, notjust another region, notjust another time. Actually, this is a very challenging time and everything that I always stood for, fought for or dreamt about or stood up for, basically is at stake right now in Ukraine. And Ukraine’s fate, on the other hand, is at stake in Odessa in the south of Ukraine because that is where things are being played out in the east. And this is the largest region of Ukraine. So it isjust... It is a very unusual situation, and in the unusual times we live in, we need to take some unusual steps, and thatis need to take some unusual steps, and that is what President Petro Poroshenko and me did together. I don’t think Ukrainians see you as a native. They see you are someone who has been parachuted in. I think Ukraine has been very supportive. That was one thing which people tried to question about outsiders when I went to Odessa but the way I have been welcomed by a very, wide range of interest that, all kinds of people from all different ethnic grounds, Ukraine is a very big melting pot and we not only me, there are a whole team of Ukrainian police, George police from my team. Basically most top prosecutors and corruption prosecutors are from my team. The number two in a anti-corruption service and justice anti-corru ption service and justice are anti-corruption service and justice are from my team. And they are all... They all have been accepted as natives and now, if you look at the Ukraine news, they are basically totally native. There is no doubt that people close to you, from Georgia, are now running very important positions and officers inside the Ukrainian government. I’m going to get back to that in a minute I want to pause and just reflect for a minute on what you bring to the table from Georgia. For a start, it is strange to say the least that you felt that taking this position in Ukraine also made it necessary for you to renounce your Georgian citizenship. Why did you do that? Well, because right now the whole region’s fate is being decided in Ukraine. If Ukraine, God forbid, falls, and I think it will hold, then the whole region will be caught up... I understand your point that Ukraine is an incredibly important theatre right now, where one of the most significant moments in Europe’s modern history is taking place. I understand you feel that way. Ijust want to talk place. I understand you feel that way. I just want to talk about George for a minute. The former Prime Minister of Georgia, who of course was an opponent of yours, COUFSE WGS BFI oppoI’lâI’ll of yOUlâS, SBVS course was an opponent of yours, says I pity our Ukrainian friends because Mikheil Saakashvili’s Council may prove disastrous. His appointment there is dangerous for Ukraine. Who cares what this man says? I can tell you, the reality is that, if Ukraine holds, then Ukraine and Georgia will survive. And the reason why Ukrainians have been bringing me in with a Georgian background is very obvious. Ukrainians are well aware of what has changed in Georgia under my leadership and that is exactly what they would like to see in Ukraine. Well, they went to war with Putin because of you and they lost. First of all, we haven’t lost because we haven’t won either. We have preserved our statehood, Russia keeps continuing occupying a big chunk ofjordan Sherratt -- Georgian territory. People want to stand up independence, no matter who they are in the government, in the case of Georgia, still these countries are continuing to challenge by their very existence, the existence of their democracies, as imperfect as they might be, the whole notion of what but might stand for. So that is why I think that it is still an ongoing battle. You said when he took thisjob in Ukraine, in Odessa, mY took thisjob in Ukraine, in Odessa, myjob is to help old and new Ukraine. You talk about the drive against corruption and the drive to turn around the economy. It is a little bit traumatic, given that platform, is it not, that you actually face indictment on serious critical charges in your own country, the country which you have renounced, for major abuses of power that could see you locked up if you ever get caught, five to eight years. You call them serious, but nobody takes them seriously. Indeed last December when I was invited as a guest of honour to the European Parliament, and the whole European Parliament denounced Georgian charges as per politically motivated. If they are so obviously politically motivated, go back, face the court and make your case. The last thing I want to do, and there is a big submission monitoring the Georgian court case by the OECD and they say there is is extensive abuse. Indeed some of my fellow government members are in prison for almost 1.5 years, under government members are in prison for almostl.5 years, under Georgian almost 1.5 years, under Georgian law it is a maximum of nine months. Essentially without. .. it is a maximum of nine months. Essentially without... In violation of all the terms. So last thing I would like to do now is to waste my time sitting in a prison on the capricious demands of the biggest private shareholder of Gazprom. They came to prosecute us, they imprison our people. You throw mud at him just as he throws mud at you but the bottom line is the prosecutor’s office consulted with one of the leading legal minds in the world right now, including a leading UK barrister, to look at the credibility of the charges against you. I am a practising lawyer, but people do retire, they can hirejust anybody for money and can produce us anything. This group cannot produce anything. It is not a good look though. Here you are saying you are going to clean out Odessa, which has been beset by trafficking and smuggling for a long time. You say you are Mr clean but a former Defence Minister in Georgia accuses you of asking him to carry out a murder. The facts are very stubborn. The facts are that when I became Georgia’s president it was 137 in the ease of doing business list, it became number eight. No other country made it to the top ten from the east of Europe. Georgia in my leadership became one of the least corrupt countries in Europe and the status country in Europe on my watch. Georgia’s Budget went up 11 times while tax were increased six times. Georgia is a role model of transformation, clean government. And this is the only country, by the way, that had the a whole term government, and a peaceful ordered transition. Hold on, you have made the case very persuasively but the fact is the Georgian people rejected you. The current government wants to prosecute you. The British government rejected Sir Winston Churchill, not that I’m comparing myself with him. People do reject even the most successful government after a while. It is said that after ten years every successful government will be rejected just for the sake of people seeing a change and that is why what I anticipated would happen. While the government are different to us, some of the governments are vicious, some of them are revengeful, some of them are ridiculous, as the government in Georgia is, because if you look now there are only two mac address in the world like that, Russia and Georgia. I have been welcomed by most heads of state, even after I retired in Europe I have been working and having official contacts in the United States, I go to all kind of international forums, in the United States, I go to all kind of internationalforums, and I don’t talk about Georgian government. When I am in Ukraine I don’t talk about the Georgian government. I don’t think about the present Georgian government because we have issues up there and we are there to stand up for a new cause. I think that the Ukrainian people are very supportive, and these questions are not being asked by Ukrainian people, I assure you. Ukrainians to go to George. Georgia will, what it looks like right now in terms of corruption and crime, Georgia used to look to the present, you go there for something else. Let me stop you there. It is clear from our conversation you have no intention of going back to Georgia. That’s fine, let’s move on. Ido have. You won’t, because if you do, you will face trial. Are you telling me that you credibly believe you can still represent a party in Georgia when you have announced Georgian citizenship, you face a trial back home? What awaits you in Georgia? There are legal technicalities but no one can take away from the historic fact that me and my friends have created a place where no real statehood existed, a real modern, European style democracy with all shortcomings. And so this is not going to be taken away. And any moment... More people, than any of that Georgian leader, your record on human rights was appalling. I don’t know what Georgia you are talking about. Georgia in terms of per capita prisoners was behind Luxembourg and Finland in terms of safety, but these figures. The reality is that Georgia went from being a country run by organised crime to the status country in Europe based on the EU survey, four is in a row, and it comes with a price. It comes with the price of cracking down on criminals and organised crime but that is what we are facing now in Ukraine. Ukrainians want us to do exactly the same thing they did in Georgia. The down... That’s interesting, let’s talk about Ukraine and your appointment and what it says. You say I was hired because my record in Georgia and they want to do that -- to do the same thing in Ukraine. Many observers think that President Boris Shango appointed you because of your record of confronting Vladimir Putin -- President Petro Poroshenko. You are one of Putin’s number one. Poroshenko. You are one of Putin’s numberone. He number one. He wanted to hang you by the balls. Well, he has said that several times. the balls. Well, he has said that severaltimes. He is the balls. Well, he has said that several times. He is interested severaltimes. He is interested in different parts of my body and my existence. Is that what you bring to the table in Ukraine? And atmosphere and the mindset of all-out confrontation with Vladimir Putin has the Mac’s Russia? Let’s see what’s at stake Ukraine? It is not about whether we can militarily defeat Russia or not. There were by the way lots of Georgian offices which came together on their own to fight for Ukraine. Some of them died the Ukraine. That really shows this is an international calls. And on that subject, pause for a second because you say it is for an international court and that is why me and my Georgian friends are there. The allegation in Moscow is that many of the stuff in your office, in Odessa today, are being paid for by the US government, is that true? It is not true. So who is funding all of the staff? US government has expressed very strong support for goVâI’Iâ1TT’IâIâ1t has âXpI’âSSâd VâI’y StI’oIâ1g SUppoI’t foI’ oUI’ support for our search. Are they providing funds? They are providing funds for the programmes we are running. But these are not officials. Is a fine distension, there is a lot of US money behind you. We’re building a service centre where we will have the faster services in the region. Issuing ideas, property transactions, all the things which Ukrainians are used to pay bribes. We will provide it free of bribes, and in a very speedy manner. And this is being funded, the whole retrieved process by the US. The US will fund the inaction of a new Ukrainian customs, different from what we have had. Of course these are experts. New customs, funded by Americans. We will work with them. And you made a big point of telling the world about the California police who are coming to train. Today we had a first march of new police, tailored after the Georgian model. That is precisely what Moscow is talking about. Behind all of the power in Ukraine as United States agenda. What you have come to personify and symbolise. It is people from my government. Ukrainians themselves. President Ukrainia ns themselves. President Poroshenko, Ukrainians themselves. President Poroshenko, he invites foreigners to do it. He is the best hope for reform in Ukraine with a radical approach, trying all kinds of approaches. What Putin might be irritated at is not that war, I went to this region to avoid war. It is poor are corrupt, the worst roads in Europe, people desperate. It is easier to flare up trouble and into ethnic violence. Russians are very good. If we curb corruption, we will, if we have police and prosecutors, if people are not abused either government, if there better infrastructure, of course Putin will lose -- by the. (CROSSTALK). I was there not because of that. You talk about your civic responsibility and how you will change the city. One veteran observer has put it, you represent a red cape right in front of the Russian ball which is about to charge. You are a provocation. -- bull. Georgia is a threat because it was asking questions. If it can build better roads than Russia, make one of the best police forces in the world, how can Russia not make it? It is very important. Odessa has an identity related to the Russian history. Culturally it is Ukranian. It has Russian cultural heritage. They are very suspicious of you. People in Odessa who speak Russian and look to Moscow, they see you as their government and they worry... No government has ever been popular at this moment. Not for the last 25 years. Your region is not full of peace and harmony. 30 bombs have gone off in the last year. We have seen some of these self defence militia, self appointed people on the streets with guns, frightening some of the Russian speaking population of your region. There is a sense that you and those around you, with the ideas you are putting forward, are deeply divisive in Odessa. The first order I gave was to remove people with guns in the city and we did it. We removed the roadblocks with masked gunmen and armoured vehicles pointed in different direction. You are telling me there are none left? They are not in the streets. I am proud this year we have doubling of tourists. Compare it with last year. There are reasons for that, like Crimea and others. We want Russian too risky to come. Two days ago we opened a film festival-- come. Two days ago we opened a film festival -- tourists. I told them that we want Russian tourists to come. Unilaterally, we lifted visas for Russians. We had I million Russian tourists on my watch in Georgia. They might be welcomed by the speak out of both sides of your mouth. On the one hand you say you are a tourist destination and you love Russians. On the other hand, you have said they represent west Berlin in the Cold War and you say that we are the frontline of a war with Putin’s Russia. And you are telling me you want to be a tourist Akhshtyr destination? telling me you want to be a tourist destination? Right now it is a calm place. We have war destination? Right now it is a calm place. We have -- we have a warfor hundred kilometres away. We have to report every casualties. Russians don’t report any of their deaths. In Ukraine there is discussion about what is happening in the war. In Russia, they don’t even recognise that a war exists. On the one hand, you have people, Putin diverts his funds,in you have people, Putin diverts his funds, in Ukraine you have to put forward everything to get funding. Democracy and freedom should emanate development and progress against all the odds. It is hard to remember that you are the governor of Odessa, not the Prime Minister of Ukraine. We have spoken before. You are using the same sort of ambitious, dramatic language that you used when you were president. Lots of Ukrainians believe you have national aspirations, that you could see yourself appointed to be the Ukrainian Prime Minister. I am focused on thisjob right Ukrainian Prime Minister. I am focused on this job right now. Things are being played out that our national issues. You really are ambitious. You are Georgian, for goodness sake. Do you believe you can have national office in Ukraine? That doesn’t mean I will have central government. You would like it, wouldn’t you? I am focused on thejob I went doing. This is important for the Ukrainian nation. -- focused on the job I important for the Ukrainian nation. -- focused on thejob I am doing. He offered to be the second vice president of Ukraine. I declined it. It is sitting in some government office. I like to be in the field. It did not appeal to be a top leader sitting in government. Maybe the phrase is, not yet. (CROSSTALK). I was offered and I declined it. I have gone to the region which is most difficult because I thought I could have been useful. You thought you could be useful in Georgia. When you were defeated politically in Georgia... That is. -- that is democracy. Forall of Georgia... That is. -- that is democracy. For all of your bellicose language, one fifth of your nation was held by the Russians. Look at Ukraine. Is not its fate to be another frozen nation with a locked in conflictjust like Georgia, just like Moldova you could say as well, thatis like Moldova you could say as well, that is Putin’s ambition it seems. From everything we have seen today, Putin will get his way. No. Ukraine has shown miracles in their fight. Putin will get his way. No. Ukraine has shown miracles in theirfight. I have been many times to the frontline. I have offices also from Georgia whom I know very well who are fighting alongside Ukraine. They say they have the best fighting spirit in the world. It is a fact of life. They are resisting against all of the odds. The insurgents in eastern Ukraine hold territory bigger than the Netherlands. eastern Ukraine hold territory biggerthan the Netherlands. I wouldn’t call it insurgents holding it. It is a Russian invasion and light with every invasion there are local people working with invaders. This is the Russian military, not some insurgents. It is not only about war. If we have these reforms in Ukraine, if we’d have the national force, in Ukraine, if we’d have the nationalforce, which is this in Kiev, a huge approach to the institutions like Georgia but Ukrainian, then if we don’t prosecute these reforms and crack on corruption, if we do better infrastructure, which is what we are trying to do, Imp route Ukrainian culture, which we will do, then we will be in a position to tell Russia, ordinary Russians, look, against all you have done to us, we have survived -- improve Ukrainian culture. You also have a future if you get rid of this government and mind your own business and do your own reforms. That is a big agenda. You seem to believe it can happen in Ukraine. You need friends. Last question, are you disappointed in the attitude from President Obama leading the Western nations? In Georgia and Ukraine he has made it plain they are not on a path to Nato membership and refuses to supply you. Do you believe your friends have let down Ukraine? I was in the United States and one of the best speeches ever made in that building when I was there. I am not asking you that. I saw the reception he got. The sanctions that exist really do work. I myself went to Washington to get defensive weapons for Ukraine. We did not get most of them yet. That is the other part that has to be dealt with. One thing is clear, when we started these reforms in Odessa, the American, British and UN ambassadors came and provided funding for a reform process. They strongly support it and understand what is at stake in Ukraine, this battle that is being played out, for the future and existence of Europe... We are out of time. Yes or no, has a Obama as of this moment let you down? I think we are still working with them and I think any of the things they have done have been helpful -- has the things they have done have been helpful-- has Obama. We still have a long way to go and primarily we need more defensive assistance, no doubt. They have been doing a very good job helping with reforms. Sanctions have been helpful. We need some more on the military side. We will survive. We will overcome. Putin will be defeated and the region will win. Ukraine will win. As well as Georgia. Mikheil Saakashvili, thank you for being on HARDtalk. Thank you. Hi there. Yesterday was, well, a pretty dismal day for many of us. A lot of low cloud, outbreaks of rain pushing its way eastwards across the country, thanks to an area of low pressure. Low pressure formed another weather front that stretches 2,500 miles into the Atlantic. As that low pressure now affects Europe, the next one will come in for Tuesday, this bulge will bring more damp weather. More rain on the way for some of us towards the end of the week. Overnight tonight, it will be pretty cloudy across England and Wales with mist and fog around the coasts and hills. Outbreaks of light rain and drizzle too and feeling very humid, especially across East Anglia with temperatures of 17. A fresher feel for Northern Ireland and Scotland. Tuesday will be another cloudy and damp day, particularly for England and Wales. There will be some spots of drizzle to start and it will be misty and murky across the Brecon Beacons and the moors of southwest England with fog shrouding the hills. The cloud could thicken enough to bring a few spots of rain across the Midlands but moving northwards, generally we are looking at a drier and brighter start to the day, particularly across parts of Scotland where you have a decent chance of seeing early morning sunshine. Through the rest of the day, the drizzle will tend to ease off across central and eastern parts of England as we head through the latter part of the morning. But later in the afternoon, the cloud will re-thicken and we will see drizzle extending its way eastwards from Wales and south-west England towards more eastern counties of England as we end the day. Further north, we could see rain for a short time across north-west England, but in Scotland it will be bright with sunny spells. A few showers in the east. Wednesday, although it starts off cloudy, many of us will see some sunshine during Wednesday afternoon across the south. There will be one or two heavy showers on Wednesday that it will be warmer and in London temperatures could reach 24 degrees and it will feel pretty humid. The third of our low pressures rocks up on Thursday and Friday, bringing outbreaks of rain to Northern Ireland on Thursday with strengthening winds off the Irish Sea. These south-easterly winds will be pulling in warm air from the Continent. Temperatures on the face of it, could reach 25 in London. We could see temperatures climbing into the high 20s depending on how much sunshine we get and how much cloud there is in the sky too. By Friday, the low pressure will have moved to the north and west, so we will see outbreaks of rain with potentially gale-force winds on the coast, and outbreaks of rain for Scotland. Still holding onto some warm weather across southeastern counties of England. That’s your forecast. ~ Hello. You’re watching BBC World News. I’m Adnan Nawaz. Our top story this hour: After the austerity deal, now the hard sell. Less than 24 hours after clinching a deal with his EU partners the Greek Prime Minister is facing resistance over the tough measures he must now introduce. Welcome to the programme. Our other main stories this hour: Marathon talks aimed at curbing Iran’s nuclear ambitions continue in Vienna. A top-level meeting is scheduled in a few hours’ time. And five billion kilometres from home, NASA’s Horizons spacecraft prepares to fly past Pluto and send back the clearest images yet. I’m Sally Bu ndock. In business... Oil prices fall in anticipation of an easing of sanctions against Iran as negotiations over the country’s nuclear programme nears a deal. Plus, the sale of the century. Experts warn Greece will struggle to sell 50 billion euros worth of assets, which is a key requirement of the country’s latest financial bail-out. After Monday morning’s announcement that Greece has finally agreed the broad outlines of a new bailout package, the most widespread analysis this Tuesday is that the country has capitulated to its creditors. Prime Minister Alex Tsipras now has until the end of Wednesday to convince his own parliament to vote for the deal. MPs will have to pass new laws on taxes, pensions and the liberalisation of the labour market. Simonjones reports. Backin Back in Athens. The Greek Prime Minister has a deal to sell to Parliament and his people. But cracks are emerging in Alexis Tsipras’s coalition with the Deputy Foreign Ministe quitting and a junior partner saying it will not back the deal agreed in Brussels. Only with pension and VAT reforms will Greek banks get an injection of tax. Taxes. Taxes. We do not have money to pay them. -- cash. The question could be, you want the drachma or not the drachma? Most of us would prefer to stay with the euro. Have been protests in Athens against more austerity. One of Greece’s largest trade unions has already called for a 24 hour strike for tomorrow. already called for a 24 hour strike fortomorrow. One for tomorrow. One minister said that no deal was not an option. The banks have been closed, as you know. That was not the choice of the government. The next step would have been an exit from the eurozone. After the Mark Bunn meeting in Brussels, the negotiations in Athens to get the deal through our continuing. -- marathon on. So what went behind the closed doors of the negotiations in Brussels? It was certainly very tense, and the talks were fraught with bickering and mistrust. Ben Bland has been investigating. It took 17 hours of talks to reach a deal. The sticking point was a demand by the German Chancellor Angela Merkel. She wanted 50 billion euros of Rick state assets put into a fund in Luxembourg to pay off creditors and rescue Greek banks. -- Greek. Alexis Tsipras was reportedly close to walking out. He said, if he agreed to one more condition he feared Greeks would brand him a sell-out. The President, Donald Tusk, chairing the summit, said he would not let Alexis Tsipras and Merkel out of his office until they agreed. Christine Lagarde and Mario Draghi twice intervened. Sources said they were extremely close to the worst-case scenario at 6am. But eventually a compromise emerged on the privatisation fund. Officials said it was a great relief. But it was a summit marked by mistrust and bickering, magnified by the fatigue. just to begin, negotiations on a bailout of up to 86 billion euros. But only if the Greek Parliament approves the deal by Wednesday. Ben Bland, BBC News. The other big diplomatic announcement the world has been waiting for is the one over Iran’s nuclear programme. After 17 days of the latest round of talks in Vienna, six world powers and Iran are reported to have drawn up a 100-page document listing restrictions on Iran’s nuclear activity and an easing of sanctions. What’s being described as a ""comprehensive meeting"" is scheduled for 8 am GMT this Tuesday. Earlier on Monday night, our Chief International correspondent, Lyse Doucet, sent this update from Vienna. All the world’s media have been camped out here for weeks, waiting for the negotiators who have been huddled inside. Some of the negotiators telling us that they didn’t leave the hotel at all, except for a one-day dash to their capitals. And in these last hours, there is a real sense now that it is almost, almost within reach. And I know that is a phrase that has been used a lot, but we sense different things. For example, they are discussing the logistics of an announcement tomorrow, they’re discussing the buses which would take the journalists, the interviews that would happen. The discussion and the mood are definitely different, but there is still that caution. It is not there yet. There are still some talks that need to take place, and we’re eyeing those balconies, just to see who comes out and who stays long into the night. Vali Nasr, a former senior advisor at the US State Department says both sides have been held back by domestic politics. I think the technicalities of the deal are easy to resolve. What keeps this deal from being concluded is politics at home. I think what holds the hands of both sides at the negotiating table is that they are worried about how a particular item was going to be construed back home. And it is also tough selling Iran too, and not necessarily with the public, but with parliament and with the establishment. Both sides are trying to go home with a deal they can sell. For more on the challenges facing negotiators and a look at the 12-year stand-off over Iran’s nuclear programme. Go to bbc.com/news and click on the link. And Sally is here with all the business news. Oil prices have been going down. As we get closer to a deal being reached they have been going down. If sanctions are lifted then some new oil could be on global financial markets depressing the price. Talks in Vienna aimed at reaching a deal on Iran’s nuclear programme seems close to a breakthrough. That is as you have just been hearing. Six world powers including the US, Russia and the UK have been negotiating with Iran about scaling down its nuclear activities in exchange for a easing of sanctions. So what would it mean for Iran IF sanctions were to be further eased? Well the country’s Oil Minister admitted recently that the sanctions were costing between four and eight billion dollars a month in lost revenue. Iran’s currency has lost two-thirds of its value as sanctions have undermined the rial. And inflation soared to 40% in 2013. So the government hopes the a deal could ease the cost of living for ordinary people. It remainsa It remains a headache for those in Iran having to grapple with prices going up and up. We will get an expert view on that in World Business Report. And of course, we will have more on Greece. I will talk to our correspondent in Athens to get a sense of where that is headed as they try to get that through Parliament on Wednesday. I will see you soon. The city of New York has agreed to pay 5.9 million dollars to the family of Eric Garner, the unarmed black man who died after a violent arrest. He had been put in a chokehold by an officer who’d stopped him for selling loose cigarettes, and his death led to protests across the United States. Nick Bryant in New York has more. The words of Eric Garner as he was held in a joke held, The words of Eric Garner as he was held in ajoke held, I held in a joke held, I can’t breathe, repeated 11 times, were held as a slogan by protesters. -- chokehold. His family had sought $75 million in damages in a wrongful death claim, but the city has reached a settlement, paying out 5.9 million, seemingly to restore the lengthy and divisive legal battle. -- forestall. The important thing is to focus on the work of reforms. We have come a long way, even in the last year, in terms of bringing the police and community together. The police force as a whole is being retrained. We are bringing on body cameras. Unnecessary and unconstitutional stops cameras. Unnecessary and unconstitutional stops are being reduced. And yet at the same time we continue to drive crime down. Friday marks the first anniversary of Eric Garner’s gaffe. A protest is planned this weekend calling on Federal authorities to take legal action against the authorities involved who so far have not faced any charges. -- Eric Garner’s death. NASA say a spacecraft launched nine years ago is on schedule to fly past Pluto later this Tuesday. The ‘New Horizon’ will take pictures and collect data from the dwarf planet, as our science reporter Rebecca Morelle explains I’lOW. A mysterious world, slowly coming into view. These are the latest images captured by New Horizons as it closes in on Pluto. But they are nothing compared to what we will see after the flyby. We’ve now visited every planet in our solar system, but not Pluto. It is a place we know almost nothing about. We’re not going to rethink our understanding. In my view, we are going to think it through for the first time. I like to think you often hear that a space mission is going to rewrite the textbooks because it has such a powerful impact on what we know. In this case we are real writing the textbook essentially from scratch. Nasa’s probe blasted off in 2006. It has hurtled nearly 5 billion kilometres to the distant edge of the solar system. While the journey has been smooth, poor Pluto has had a more turbulent time. It was controversially demoted from a planet to a dwarf world, but that doesn’t make its exploration any less thrilling. Here at New Horizons mission HQ, scientists have been waiting patiently for this moment for nearly a decade, and now the stage is finally set for the spacecraft’s arrival. And we’ve been promised the pictures it will send back should be spectacular. And this is vital, because Pluto’s home the Kuiper Belt is where all eyes are trained. It is a vast disc of space once thought empty but scientists now believe it holds hundreds of thousands of icy worlds, comets and space rocks, debris from the turbulence birth of our solar system 4.6 billion years ago. It’s the first time we’ll ever see, directly, anything in the Kuiper Belt up close. I mean, at the moment, Kuiper Belt is only something we study with telescopes. We’ve never had a mission pass through there, so it’s a kind of unexplored frontier of the solar system. Until now, artists’ renderings of Pluto have been drawn entirely from the imagination. But, on Wednesday, the first close-up pictures from the fly- by should arrive home, at last revealing this hidden world.

The latest headlines: The Greek Prime Minister is facing growing opposition in Athens to the tough austerity measures he’s agreed to in exchange for a new bailout. Representatives of six world powers and Iran are still working on a deal OI’l Health officials in Sierra Leone have warned that new cases of Ebola are continuing to emerge, more than a year after the outbreak was first declared. There had been a sharp decline in cases in recent months but in the capital, Freetown, there’s been a a spike in new infections. Neighbouring Liberia is also battling a new outbreak. Many children there lost their parents and have been left with nothing. Anne Soy reports from Paynesville in Liberia. It looks like a normal family in a suburb outside Monrovia but far from it. These two girls, 13 and 11 lost their entire family to Ebola injust one month. They also got infected. They thought they would die but survived. Life has not been the same since then.

Western economic sanctions imposed on Russia as a result of the Ukraine conflict are having a significant impact. The Russian government believes they’re costing at least 40 billion dollars a year, and western investment in the country has slumped. In response, President Putin is trying to deepen economic ties with Asian countries, especially China. Russia’s far eastern regions, remote and long neglected, are now seen as a key asset in the nation’s bid to become an Asian economic power. BBC Hardtalk’s Stephen Sackur has this report from the Pacific port of Vladivostok. Vladivostok, Russia’s Pacific port, more than 5000 miles east of Moscow. During Soviet times, it was a closed military city. It is still home to Russia’s Pacific Fleet. Now Chinese money is helping to remake Russia’s Far East. This new apartment block is a Chinese investment built by Chinese workers. Outside Vladivostok, Russia’s Far East looks much as it did before the revolution. That is until you see Asian agribusiness at work. Chinese and South Korean investors are leasing Russian farmland on a massive scale. They need the food. Russia needs the outside help to exploit its vast resources. Why do you come all the way from South Korea to farm in the east of Russia? South Korea has small farmland and we need more crops and grains for people and for cattle. Russia is making a big bat on the development of its eastern frontier. The plan is to Stern Vladivostok into a trans Siberian Las Vegas. Young Russians are being trained as dealers and croupier ‘s. And this is where they will work. A vast casino resorts built with almost $1 billion by a Hong Kong gaming tycoon. The operations manager is a Scotsman. Vladivostok isn’t exactly Monte Carlo. Does this really make any sense at all? We are in the centre of an area of 100 - 150 million in terms of underserved market. There are hardly any Russians living here. There are only a couple of casinos in Korea and there are only a couple in China and currently there is not one in Russia until we finish it. Vladimir Putin, under pressure from Western sanctions, is making a picnic to Asia. Last month, China’s president with his special guest in Moscow. Russia needs China’s money and the mutual distrust is being buried for now. There is a danger at that because of the imbalance in the economic power of China and Russia, China will come to dominate your far Eastern economy. If we can develop the region without the Chinese we will do it, if we cannot do it, we will invite them to support us somehow. We do have natural limitations. Chinese tourists now enjoy Vladivostok’s stunning views. To the west, Russia sees nothing but hostility so Moscow is desperately looking east for economic salvation. Displaying self control and resisting temptation is the central philosophy of the Muslim month of Ramadan. Taking part in the month long fast, from sunrise to sunset every day, is one of the five pillars of Islam, but how much more challenging is it for people who work in the food business? BBC Arabic reporter Carine Torbey has been talking to a top chef in Lebanon who prepares the iftar, the evening meal, for 300 people every day. In Lebanon, Muslims to observe Ramadan fast for over 16 hours per day -- to. Thisjust fast as Ramadan fast for over 16 hours per day -- to. This just fast as well and every day he comes here with a team of assistants to prepare for hours the meal of iftar. I wonder how he can see this delicious food and resist tasting it. Ithen how he can see this delicious food and resist tasting it. I then asked him how he makes sure his food has enough salt and pepper. One hour before iftar, when people break their fast, he and his team spring into action. The kitchen becomes a beehive of activity. As the call for prayer rings out, it is time to serve the food. Everyone started eating around half-an-hour ago but the chef is the last to break the fast. Sport now. The 144th British Open golf Championship begins on Thursday. The defending champion Rory Mcllroy won’t be at St Andrews because of injury but Tiger Woods will be. A three time winner of the event and a 14 time major champion, he hasn’t won any of the biggest titles since 2008. He’s been speaking exclusively to our Sports Editor, Dan Roan. How do you feel coming into this week? You have won here twice before. It is my favourite golf course in the world. I love this golf course and just coming back here and remembering the shots and all the good times! here and remembering the shots and all the good times I have had here... The creativity that it takes and the discipline. People don’t realise how much you have to shape the ball or the discipline it takes to play this golf course. Could you win? Absolutely. You really believe that? Absolutely. You played well a few weeks ago. Do you think you have cracked it and found a solution? I wouldn’t say found a solution, it is a process and an evolution. It is making subtle shifts, fine tuning. You keep getting the overall pattern different and that takes time. Almost 60 years after it was written, the American author Harper’s Lee’s second novel Go Set a Watchman is going on sale around the world. Three, two, one... These eagar fans stayed up until midnight at a bookshop in London in order to be one of the first to get their hands on the eagerly awaited book. It’s Harper Lee’s second novel after her Pulitzer Prize-winning To Kill a Mockingbird was published in the 1960s. Go Set a Watchman is set 20 years after Harper Lee’s classic and repaints some of Mockingbird’s heroes in a less flattering light. I’m quite wary, I guess, of it changing my perception because characters that have meant so much to so many people are being drawn into question and that could be upsetting. I’ve gone into this with an open mind. I don’t feel like I have any expectations of anything. I think that we need to take this book as it was meant to be, on its own as its own work of art. Iran over here as soon as I saw it was being released and pre-ordered it straightaway. I have had this receipt in my pocket for the last three months waiting for it to come out. I thought I might as well come out at midnight and get it as soon as possible and just read it. Monday turned out to be a dismal day and a cloud was thick enough to bring rain across many areas. The low pressure system responsible is now out into the continent but this isjust one of three low pressure systems that will affect the UK this week with another couple on the front stretching 2500 miles into the Atlantic. Each one will bring more rain towards the UK. Overnight it will stay cloudy across England and Wales. Occasional spots of drizzle and turning murky with mist and fog across the hills and coast. Very humid across east Anglia with temperatures no lower than 70 degrees. No comes double nights sleep ahead. Onto Tuesday, -- comfortable, there will be occasional light rain and drizzle. Another murky one with low cloud across the Brecon Begins. -- Beacons. Scotland looks to have the best start to the day on Wednesday and you may catch morning sunshine. On Tuesday, the cloud will fade away across central and eastern England for a time so any rain will ease the way but it later in the afternoon, you could see more in the way of light rain and drizzle extending towards eastern counties of England later on in the day. Further north we have sunshine and in the south it is still cloudy and humid. A better chance of seeing the cloud breakup on Wednesday. Most of us should see sunshine across the south of England and Wales that there will be heavy, slow-moving showers to watch out for. Between the showers and the sunshine it could become quite warm in London with highs of 24 degrees. This area of low pressure will move north towards Northern Ireland. The winds will be fresh off the Irish Sea. The winds will gather the warm air from the continent and we could have warm and humid weather across parts of England and maybe Wales as well. 25 degrees for London but we could see temperatures reaching the upper 20s could see temperatures reaching the upper20s depending on could see temperatures reaching the upper 20s depending on how much sunshine we see on Thursday. ~ This is BBC World News. The headlines: The Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, is beginning a new set of negotiations today, this time trying to convince his own parliament to approve the terms of the bailout he agreed in Brussels, which came with strict conditions. Talks between Iran and six world powers aimed at reaching a deal on Tehran’s nuclear programme continued into the early hours of Tuesday morning in the Austrian capital, Vienna. There are indications that confirmation of an agreement could be imminent. The American Space Agency’s New Horizons probe has begun its close encounter with Pluto. The robotic craft will shortly fly past the dwarf planet at over fifty thousand kilometres per hour. Health officials in Sierra Leone have warned that new cases of Ebola are continuing to emerge. There had been a sharp decline in cases in recent months, but the capital, Freetown, is currently seeing a spike in new infections. Those are the latest headlines from BBC World News. Now for the latest financial news with World Business Report. Oil prices fall in anticipation of an easing of sanctions against Iran as negotiations over the country’s nuclear programme nears a deal. Plus, the sale of the century! Experts warn Greece will struggle to sell 50 billion euros worth of assets, which is a key requirement of the country’s latest financial bail-out. Welcome to World Business Report. ~ Iam I am Sally Bundock. Also in the programme, we will look at the markets. The Europhoria is increasing. We will take a look at the numbers. Talks in Vienna aimed at reaching a deal on Iran’s nuclear programme seems close to a breakthrough. Six world powers including the US, Russia and the UK have been negotiating with Iran about scaling down its nuclear activities in exchange for a easing of sanctions. So, what would it mean for Iran if sanctions were to be further eased? Well the country’s Oil Minister admitted recently the sanctions were costing between four and eight billion dollars a month in lost !'âVâ!'lUâ. Iran’s currency has lost two-thirds of its value as sanctions have undermined the rial. And to make matters worse for consumers prices have been rising inflation has soared by 40 percent. So the government hopes the a deal could ease the cost of living for ordinary people. With me is Amrita Sen, Chief Oil Analyst at Energy Aspects. It is nice to see you again. We seem to be on the brink of a breakthrough here. Your thoughts. We are most likely going to get the deal. It has been dragging on for some time. The initial deadline was due on the 30th. Even yesterday they were saying it was imminent. Today the announcement that it is not yet. The US arms embargo lifting is the latest twist. Iran is demanding it is lifted. The US does not see the link. Russia is the one pushing it because they want to sell arms to Iraq. That is the latest kind of gridlock at the moment. We still think they will be a deal. What will it look like? In terms of the sanctions being lifted, to what extent and how will it work? It will take time. They missed thejuly nine deadline. Congress has 60 days rather than 32 review. That means another month. They could veto it but the president has every opportunity to overturn it. -- 30 to. They will probably block the deal, but it should not matter for oil markets. As soon as the president vetoes the deal and they will give in on some sanctions relief straightaway. .. will give in on some sanctions relief straightaway... But the real challenge will be the upstream sanctions in place, the US sanctions on Iran. Oiland sanctions in place, the US sanctions on Iran. Oil and gas production. It will take ages for companies to be able to go back. It takes time to unwind the sanctions. We are looking at new oil coming out of the Rhine in the second half of 2016. -- Iran. Lets say that we do see the progress you are discussing. Obama does the veto, et cetera. When the oil is on line properly, to what effect will we see it in the market? We have done a study of Iranian oil fields. Even before the latest round of sanctions their oil fields have Even before the latest round of sanctions their oilfields have been under sanctions in terms of Western expertise. That means that the clients are extremely high. Double-digit. 10-18%. -- the decline. We need companies to go in there and spend capital and time to revive the oil industry. We think between 300 -500 per day next year. Have they got the money and time to invest? They are all struggling with the lower oil price and revenues. This is not an ideal time, of course. I think companies, particularly European oil companies, have worked in Iran in the past. The reserves are there. If you look at the football you at the moment, it will be relatively low cost, compared to other parts of the world, like the Arctic. -- portfolio. It will be slow. Not tomorrow, which many people expected. Thank you very much and it. She will return. She has five minutes to get her head around all the international stories of the day. In the meantime, let’s talk about Greece as you have been hearing. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has returned home after the weekend’s marathon negotiations over a third bailout package for his indebted nation. But those talks may seem easy compared to tha battle he is now facing, convincing his country that it is a good deal. Many Greeks feel the conditions for the deal were too harsh. Tanya Beckett is in Athens for us. Pressure back on Alexis Tsipras now. He has got to get his government on board and opposition politicians as well. -- onboard. Yeah. Are understanding does far, you are referring to the vote he has to get through Parliament, pushing all of these reforms that have been stipulated by the creditors, we understand that the opposition parties are onboard for this. The problem he will have is within his own party because his own party was against austerity and was voted into government on a mandate of doing precisely what it is now about to do. This morning the mood in Greece seems a little bit moving towards acceptance. There is still anger that the nation of this as the birthplace of democracy... It seems to be leaving the country. They are being told what to do, as far as they are concerned, by other countries, the Greeks. But they see an opportunity to leave their economic history behind. I will show you what is happening in the newspapers. A statue of Alexander the Great, the great conquerer, of course, he has a bloody nose. That is a tabloid newspaper. Era, the word is vertigo. You can see Alexis Tsipras and the stress he is going through. -- here. And a more conservative newspaper here saying thatitis conservative newspaper here saying that it is time for Greece to take responsibility. This is the conclusion that many people appear to now be coming to that perhaps it is time to move on. As one person once said to me during the financial crisis that started in 2008-2009, don’t waste crisis. This could provide an opportunity. In terms of moving on, of course, banks being open and able to get cash, that normality needs to return at some point. Where are we with that? That is a good question. We have of course mentioned the votes. The other two things that need to be arranged hastily are for the banks to be opened. We understand that will not happen before the end of Wednesday. Greek anticipated that there would be some sort of cash crunch and had set aside for that. I went out to do a bit of shopping yesterday afternoon. We were watching consumer behaviour. People still were apparently using cards in shops and still had some access to cash. Right now it is not an immediate crisis but is a large inconvenience. The other problem is thatit inconvenience. The other problem is that it needs money now. It cannot wait to negotiate the bailout. What it has to do is to bridge financing in order to meet its debt obligations injuly and August, most notably on the 20th ofjuly as well. It has to pay back the ECB. There is a fairly urgent thing that needs to be done. It will be a very rocky path. Once they have in through that and the Summer which of course Greeks are touched to.

The Asia edition of the Wall Street journal looks at how ""cloud computing"" is eating into India’s outsourcing industry as one drug company plans to cut its spending by half. Businesses in the UK may soon be forced to publish the average salaries of their male and female employees in a bid to close the gender pay gap. That story in the Times. And the japanese Times looks at the future of Nintendo after the death of its president Satoru Iwata. The question many articles ask is who will now take over as the head of the gaming company? joining us is Amrita Sen. She is an Oil analyst at Energy Aspects. We talked about Greece and the potential bailout deal that has happened but there is still some way to go and they will probably be back at the negotiating table to look at more details. Do you think everything is going to go as they think it is in Brussels when they sign their papers? I am not convinced. I think this will continue for some time. Alexis Tsipras has faced so much opposition domestically. Everybody who is anti-austerity will be protesting and even his own party has said this is very intrusive. I think they have called it a coup. It will not be easy at all for him. Some are thinking there will be snap elections and some sort of unity government. What changes in a country when technocrats takeover rather than politicians? It could go both ways, you could argue but from their point of view, if you get technocrats taking over, you might see a little bit more of things that are good for business as opposed to going with what they’ve said at any cost. The Greek banks are still closed and people are running out of money. It they had a technocrats running Italy for a short period of time and it gave everybody a bit of breathing space. It was a bit of time out from the political volatility. Because they are not worried about future votes. Businesses are focused on. They can just settle and have a break from political turmoil. just settle and have a break from politicalturmoil. I political turmoil. I don’t think ideally that Europe would want that but that is where we might be heading. Let’s look at the Wall Street journal. heading. Let’s look at the Wall Streetjournal. The oil market is seeing red, can you explain what this headline means? All it means is we have seen a massive fall in oil prices. 60% from last year. And you are seeing a huge amount of investment postponed or projects cancelled. Caltex is down by $100 million which is a huge number. I think the problem with the market is the dichotomy between the short-term fundamentals and the long-term prospects. There will be tightness. It may not manifest until 2017 but we already can’t get rid of many projects. Word you see oil prices? At the moment it is $50 a barrel or so. Short term I don’t think there is much upside. But going into late 2016-early 2017, we expect prices to be back in the 90s or $100. The Spikes could come back again. I reckon you are more informed than the Bible of the uninformed, Wikipedia which says Iran is seventh in oil-producing countries. They say their peak production was prior to 1974 but how many Western countries import oil? Almost none. Literally almost none. Turkey does. It will completely revolutionize what has happened with the rainy and oil-- Iranian. The decline has been eaten away to lack of investment. It is the question of supply rather than demand in the West. I could tell you some questions about outsourcing my calls to India... Let me tell you a story but it doesn’t reflect well on their industry. I called up and said I wanted to take a train from London to Hertfordshire where I live and they said it would take two and a half hours. It’s a 21 minute journey and he said I had to take a bus and then transfer in Manchester. I asked to go to Stonehenge as well and they didn’t know where it was. Outsourcing is not always that bad but... Most of the time when you call companies they are outsourced. It accounts for 20% of India’s exports of goods and services and the problem is with cloud computing, you don’t need physical computers. It is going to eat into their revenues unless things change. This focus is on the British drug company AstraZeneca which has used India for outsourcing but they’re going to cut back on that, $750 million. Quite a significant sum. For those companies and employees in India, this is a big deal. It is. And cities like Bangalore and Hyderabad have been built on it. They should have seen this coming. That is what everyone is arguing. It is not that they can survive but they have to change. Many companies are going from around a 100 employees to less than ten. I did see a very sweet Hollywood film about an outsourcing Centre in India -- Bollywood. This is about David Cameron writing a letter to the Times today regarding the gender pay gap. He said he wanted sorted by the time his daughters go to work. By the time I started working, I found out that my male colleagues were paid more than me and they fixed it quickly but if I hadn’t found out, I would’ve continued to be paid less. That is my problem. Why are we talking about this today? It is good that we are. We should be ignoring it. But the fact is, I have either been told that women should be assertive and ask but why should we need to? The whole point should be that if the job is equal, pay them the same amount. It is ridiculous but I’m glad this is taken up here. It is pretty obvious why it is pretty obvious why does the case. Is this is run mostly by men. The idea is the naming and shaming of businesses here will do it but why does it take a Prime Minister with daughters to make that happen? Barack Obama did the same thing in the states because he has two daughters. Why is it not ingrained in the education system that it is about a quality? Again, India is much worse. Mark Carney has four daughters and he is the governor of the Bank of England. So there is hope for all of us. I have two daughters and they love playing video games but I still thrash them. Only because they are very young. Are you sure? Yes. I love video games but! young. Are you sure? Yes. I love video games but I really got them. I lose every game ever. I don’t have a very good track record but! lose every game ever. I don’t have a very good track record but I do feel sad because nowadays all the kids are on their iPhones and iPods playing all these games. The reason we are talking about it is because the CEO of Nintendo died very sadly at 55 years old. He was being treated for cancer. It happened very suddenly and he was CEO but there was no succession plan in place although he was being treated for cancer. This is obviously something they didn’t foresee. That is part of theissue they didn’t foresee. That is part of the issue because they have struggled with competition from many different places, particularly this markdowns and I think that is why they have they to markdowns and I think that is why they to get somebody innovative. It needs to change, similar to the Indian industries. It is always a great pleasure to see you. Thank you for coming in and we will see you soon. Goodbye. Hi there. Yesterday was, well, a pretty dismal day for many of us. A lot of low cloud, outbreaks of rain pushing its way eastwards across the country, thanks to an area of low pressure. Low pressure formed another weather front that stretches 2,500 miles into the Atlantic. As that low pressure now affects Europe, the next one will come in for Tuesday, this bulge will bring more damp weather. More rain on the way for some of us towards the end of the week. Overnight tonight, it will be pretty cloudy across England and Wales with mist and fog around the coasts and hills. Outbreaks of light rain and drizzle too and feeling very humid, especially across East Anglia with temperatures of 17. A fresher feel for Northern Ireland and Scotland. Tuesday will be another cloudy and damp day, particularly for England and Wales. There will be some spots of drizzle to start and it will be misty and murky across the Brecon Beacons and the moors of southwest England with fog shrouding the hills. The cloud could thicken enough to bring a few spots of rain across the Midlands but moving northwards, generally we are looking at a drier and brighter start to the day, particularly across parts of Scotland where you have a decent chance of seeing early morning sunshine. Through the rest of the day, the drizzle will tend to ease off across central and eastern parts of England as we head through the latter part of the morning. But later in the afternoon, the cloud will re-thicken and we will see drizzle extending its way eastwards from Wales and south-west England towards more eastern counties of England as we end the day. Further north, we could see rain for a short time across north-west England, but in Scotland it will be bright with sunny spells. A few showers in the east. Wednesday, although it starts off cloudy, many of us will see some sunshine during Wednesday afternoon across the south. There will be one or two heavy showers on Wednesday that it will be warmer and in London temperatures could reach 24 degrees and it will feel pretty humid. The third of our low pressures rocks up on Thursday and Friday, bringing outbreaks of rain to Northern Ireland on Thursday with strengthening winds off the Irish Sea. These south-easterly winds will be pulling in warm air from the Continent. Temperatures on the face of it, could reach 25 in London. We could see temperatures climbing into the high 20s depending on how much sunshine we get and how much cloud there is in the sky too. By Friday, the low pressure will have moved to the north and west, so we will see outbreaks of rain with potentially gale-force winds on the coast, and outbreaks of rain for Scotland. Still holding onto some warm weather across southeastern counties of England. That’s your forecast. # I can’t see anyone but you... # She’s a pretty girl. Can a happy future follow a troubled past?

Good morning. First, our main story: Large firms will be forced to publish details of their pay gap between men and women. David Cameron says the move will pressure firms into boosting women’s wages. The move has been welcomed by Labour, but it says the Government has been slow to act. Steph is with us now. The Prime Minister talks about closing the pay gap within a generation. How big a task is it? It has been falling, so at the moment if you look at what the average pay gap is between how much men working full-time get compared to women, men get on average 9.4% more. That is the figure from last year. That has gone down from 10% the year before. If you look at all employees, i.e. People working part-time as well as full-time, that GPP part-time as well as full-time, that gap is much bigger. So on average men are nearly 20% more than women working full-time or part-time, so nearly a fifth more, which is quite a considerable gap. Both those gaps have been getting smaller. They are actually the lowest on record, the records have been going since 1997. So it has been coming down, but today as you say the government are announcing that any firm with more than 250 employees needs to publish theirfigures than 250 employees needs to publish their figures on what the difference is. It was if you look at it at the moment our large firms employ a majority of workers across the UK. The government wants people to publish it so that we and the workers can see what the differences and hold them to account and potentially name and shame them for it. The Scottish National Party has said it willjoin Labour MPs in opposing Government plans to relax the ban on fox hunting in England and Wales. The SNP said it was voting on the issue because it wanted to remind the Conservative partyjust how slender its majority is. Our Scotland correspondent Colin Blane has the details. The Scottish National Party has spotted an opportunity to tweak the tale of the Conservative government in tomorrow’s vote on foxhunting. ",,

A historic moment as a deal on limiting Iran’s nuclear programme in return for the lifting of sanctions is agreed in Vienna. All smiles after several years of negotiation involving six world powers - including the US, Russia and the UK. Iran hails the deal a victory for democracy. I believe this is a historic moment. We are reaching an agreement which is not perfect for anyone, but it is what we could accomplish. We have stopped the spread of nuclear weapons in this region. Because of this deal, the international community will be able to verify that the Islamic Republic of Iran will not develop a nuclear weapon. Not everyone’s happy - Israel describes the deal as a capitulation of historic proportions to what they call an Iran-led axis of evil. Our concern, of course, is that the militant Islamic State of Iran is going to receive a sure path to nuclear weapons. Many of the restrictions that were supposed to prevent it from getting there will be lifted. We’ll be getting reaction live in Tehran, jerusalem and Washington.

And Ofsted warns of pupils disappearing from schools in Tower Hamlets. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. It’s taken nine years of on-off negotiation, but today world powers reached a deal with Iran on limiting Iranian nuclear activity in return for the lifting of international economic sanctions. Iran’s Foreign Minister called the agreement historic. In the last hour, President Obama said the deal removed the threat of nuclear war in the region for the next 15 years. More guarded, the EU negotiator hailed it as a sign of hope. Others, though - particularly Israel - are not happy. This report from our world affairs correspondent Richard Galpin. Finally, after more than a decade of not negotiations, agreement has been reached between the major world powers and Iran on curbing its nuclear programme. The aim, to prevent Iran from building atomic weapons. I believe this is a historic moment. We are reaching an agreement that is not perfect for anybody, but it is what we could accomplish and it is an important achievement for all of us. Today could have been the end of hope on this issue. But now we are starting a new chapter of hope. Iran has always insisted its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes only. But under today’s deal, these facilities will be scaled right back, with the aim of making it impossible for terror unto building nuclear weapons quickly if it ever decided to do so quickly -- nuclear weapons quickly if it ever decided to do so quickly -- make it impossible for Tehran. If the agreement is violated, according to UN inspectors, sanctions which I been listed will be reimposed. The international community will be able to verify the Islamic Republic of Iran will not develop a nuclear weapon. In return, the crippling sanctions imposed on Iran in recent years will be lifted. This will include releasing more than $100 billion from frozen Iranian assets. For some of the West’s most important allies in the Middle East, this amounts to far too many concessions to run. Our concern is that the militant Islamic state of Iran will receive a sure path to nuclear weapons, many of the restrictions that were supposed to prevent it from getting there will be lifted and in addition Iran will get a jackpot, a cash bonanza of hundreds of billions of dollars, which will enable it to continue to pursue its aggression and terror in the region and the world. Speaking last few minutes, the Iranian president insisted his government would abide by the terms of the deal, as long as the world powers remained committed. He said a new era had begun. Richard Galpin, BBC News. Let’s get the latest from our correspondents. Ina moment, In a moment, jon Sopel in Washington, but first, Yolande Knell injuries. ~ -- injuries. Lots of disappointment. The new has campaigned for a deal-- against a deal being struck. He has talked about the dangers of lifting sanctions. We’re hearing from Israeli officials that they are planning to use all diplomatic means to lobby against this deal being ratified. We understand that means they will be approaching members of the US Congress. If you look at the bigger picture, basically Israel does not buy out all the assurances that we are getting from Tehran that their nuclear plans are completely peaceful. Israel will point out that Tehran has threatened Israel in the past, and sponsors militant groups in the region, groups in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, which have attacked Israel. It is worth pointing out as well that the concerns that Israel has our shared with some other countries in the region. If you look around, there is worry about what this means, the rapprochement between Iran and Western powers, taking only when you go to the Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia, another key US ally. They think this is the sign of changing relationships in this region, where what you see is City Muslim powers vying for influence with Shia Muslim forces led by a run. -- vying for influence with Shia Muslim forces led by a run. -- Sunni Muslim powers. This feeds into conflict in Syria, Iraq and Yemen. jon Sopel is in Washington. O Balmer is hailing the deal, that he has to persuade sceptics? Yes, and many in Congress will be deeply sceptical. It has to be approved by Congress. The Congress has the power to say that sanctions should not be lifted. If that happens, the deal would unravel. It is more of a theoretical possibility, they would need a two thirds majority in both houses to rejected, it is unlikely. But there are serious questions they will want to address about the terms of the deal, what concessions have been made, the lifting of sanctions, will run now start trading ballistic missiles, reinforcing their position as the regional superpower? -- missiles, reinforcing their position as the regional superpower? -- will Iran now start trading? And what happens at the end of the 15 years? President Obama was keen to point out that this deal is not based on trust that verification. Will the weapons inspectors be able to come and go freely wherever and whenever they like best remark those are the questions that will be answered. This president has reputation for being somewhat cold and austere, and not very keen on persuading people. He will have the changes act to get this through. The president will be engaged at on a long and slow Tehran cruiser! A planned vote on relaxing the rules on fox hunting in England and Wales has been postponed after the Scottish Nationalist Party warned it would vote against the proposals. It was a decision that had angered the Government, because SNP members said they wouldn’t vote on laws which don’t apply in Scotland. Here’s our political correspondent, Alex Forsyth. Once again, fox-hunting is proving a highly emotive matter. This time, the row is as much about politics as the issue itself. The SNP threatened to block Government plans to relax fox-hunting laws using the weight of its newly-elected MPs. The reason? In part, anger over what they see as the Government’s shoddy treatment of Scottish MPs in Westminster. Given the attitude of David Cameron and his Government towards the mandate of Scottish MPs since the election, perhaps just remind them that the majority is quite a slender one and perhaps they need to take a more constructive approach in the future. This protest is over plans to relax the law on fox-hunting in England and Wales. The SNP don’t usually weigh in on matters that don’t affect Scotland. But it’s chosen this issue to raise the stakes on a constitutional row over whether English MPs should have more say over English issues. The Government says it’s only fair as more powers devolve to Scotland. The Prime Minister questioned the SNP stance on fox-hunting, which has forced him to delay the vote. The position of the SNP has always been clear, which is they do not vote on matters that are purely of interest to England, or England and Wales, particularly, if they have already settled that issue in Scotland, so I find their position today entirely opportunistic. The SNP’s attempt to outfox the Government mightjust have strengthened resolve to give English MPs more say on English matters. Alex Forsyth, BBC News. Let’s speak to our assistant political editor, Norman Smith. This is not a row about fox hunting? It is about something much bigger, the Constitution, Scotland /England, Westminster versus. .. Normally Nicola Sturgeon would not get involved. She says she will not vote on English fox hunting. She was here at Westminster with her MPs last night, they decided they were going to vote. Why? Because she is in fighting mood. going to vote. Why? Because she is infighting mood. She in fighting mood. She is furious about what she regards as Cameron’s lack of respect for SNP can his decision to press ahead with English votes for English laws, his refusal to cede more powers to the Scottish Parliament. Nicola Sturgeon’s view is that if you play hardball, I will play hardball. If you want to cut its rough, I will cut rough over fox hunting. She warns that unless Cameron changes his approach, SNP MPs might intervene on Bainbridge affairs. His response has been to beat a bit of a retreat. Some Tory MPs are hoping that in the meantime he might introduce tougher sanctions to stop SNP MPs being able to vote on English issues. But this is battle deferred, notjust over fox hunting but also between David Cameron and Nicola Sturgeon. My advice, dearviewers, is take Cameron and Nicola Sturgeon. My advice, dear viewers, is take cover! This will get the likely. Thank you, Norman. -- this will get likely. In the last few minutes, the Home Secretary, Theresa May, has announced the creation of a new ""secure zone"" in Calais for UK-bound lorries. Our home affairs correspondent, Daniel Sandford, is with me. She has onlyjust been speaking about what is clearly a big problem? Everybody remembers the chaotic scenes on the French side of the channel, exacerbated by the strike action. It forced British lorry drivers coming to Britain to queue outside the pots, then we saw these scenes of illegal migrants cutting their way into the tops of lorries, piling into the back, hanging off the bottom, trying to get into Britain. We have statistics from the Home Secretary, 8000 people tried to illegally cross the border point into Britain and was stopped on the French side of the border in just three weeks at the end ofjune and the first two weeks ofjuly. It concentrated minds in the Home Office and the French Interior Ministry, they have agreed to create a secure zone inside the port, the equivalent to a 2.5 mile trafficjam outside the port, 230 lorries that might have had to queue outside the port, they will be allowed inside and then queue inside while they are waiting to board ferries, because there is a worry that the strike action has not gone away and this could be a very difficult summer, and they are trying to deal with at least part of the problem in a Beeld UP least part of the problem in a Beeld up to what could be a tough few months. A coroner has been outlining a litany of gross failings that led to the deaths of three army reservists on an SAS selection exercise. james Dunsby, Edward Maher and Craig Roberts all died from heat exhaustion on the hottest day of the year in july 2103. ~ __ ]Uly -- july 2013. But the coroner said risk assessments hadn’t been adequate - and neglect had contributed to the deaths. From the inquest, here’s our defence correspondent, jonathan Beale This isjust part of what it takes tojoin the best of This isjust part of what it takes to join the best of the best. This isjust part of what it takes tojoin the best of the best. The Brecon Beacons has long been the testing ground for the elite SAS. We joined a group following in their footsteps. The same 16 mile march against the clock, carrying more than £50-macro, bricks instead of rifles. Two years ago, a march like this ended in tragedy, with the deaths of three soldiers. At put a blot on the British Army. I still get tearful, and I always will. I just... It is so hard. When you do hear the failings. Ijust just... It is so hard. When you do hear the failings. I just don’t want it to happen again. His sonjames Dunsby, along with fellow reservists Edward Maher and Craig Roberts, were described in court as marvellous fit man with a do or die attitude, taken down at the height of that ambition. The weather on the Brecon Beacons can change in an instant. Two years ago it was the hottest day of the year. At some checkpoints there was no water. The regulars taken part at already had a week to prepare on the mountains, but the reservists did not. Nor had the army properly assessed risks on the day or put in adequate rescue plans when men went down. By the time the emergency services arrived, it was already too late. They had set off on the 16 mile march atjust before 7am, they were carrying GPS trackers to monitor their movements. By the time Craig Roberts had reached checkpoint five, two soldiers had already been withdrawn with heat illness. Craig collapsed nearing the end. Edward Maher took a different route, his GPS tracker stopped moving for almost two hours before anyone noticed. Eithertime medical almost two hours before anyone noticed. Either time medical staff reached him, rigor mortis was setting in. james Dunsby was also on the final leg of the march, he had been down for more than an hour before the medics arrived. Reaching a conclusion of neglect, the coroner said there was a series of very serious mistakes and systemic failings. The army had failed to properly manage and organise the march. If it had followed the MoD’s own guidance, the march should have been stopped and all three soldiers would have survived. Following the verdict, the wife ofjames Dunsby made this statement. There have been times during the course of this inquest when the Ministry of Defence has lost sight of the importance of their very own values and standards. They displayed no responsibility, no accountability and no humility for their role in creating the culture which led to the events of the 13th ofjuly 2013. We are truly sorry for all the mistakes that the coroner identified today. We have already made a number of changes to the exercise in terms of the way it is run as the result of and those of the Health and Safety Executive. The SAS still use these mountains for selection, but after this ruling it will have to make changes, to make sure this never happens again. Our top story this lunchtime: An historic deal on limiting Iran’s nuclear programme has been signed in Vienna, in return for the lifting of sanctions. And still to come: New Horizon arrives at our furthest planetary neighbour. It’s just 7,000 miles above Pluto. Later on BBC London: The primary school in east London campaign against a proposal to build hundreds of flats near West Ham Football Ground. And after decades of waiting, Londoners wait for the stroke of midnight to get their hands on Harper Lee’s new book. In the last half-hour, a spacecraft has flown within just 7,500 miles of the surface of Pluto. New Horizons has taken more than nine years to reach the dwarf planet, which lies almost three billion miles from the Earth. Over the next 24 hours it’s hoped it will send back high-resolution images of a planet no-one has ever seen before. Here’s our science correspondent, Rebecca Morelle. A mysterious world coming into view. These are the last images captured by New Horizons as it closed in on Pluto. They will be nothing compared to the view from the fly- by. At mission HQ, to the view from the fly- by. At mission HO, celebrations greeted the moment of closest approach. However, success won’t be confirmed until the probe sends a signal back home. This mission’s been a long time coming. We visited every planet in our Solar System, but not Pluto. It is a place we know almost nothing about. New Horizons blasted off in 2006. It’s hurtled five billion kilometres to the distant edge of the Solar System. While the journey has been smooth, poor Pluto has had a more turbulent time. It was demoted from a planet to a dwarf world, but that doesn’t make its exploration any less thrilling. Here at New Horizons Mission HO scientists have had to wait patiently for this moment for a decade, but they say it is worth it. The images this spacecraft captures should be spectacular, showing features down to the size of a football pitch. Pluto’s home is where all eyes are trained. It’s a vast disc of space once thought empty. Scientists believe it holds hundreds of comets. At the moment, it is only something we study with telescopes. We have never had a mission pass through there. It is an unexplored frontier of the Solar System. Our understanding of Pluto is set to be transformed. If the mission has worked the first pictures should arrive home tomorrow. At last, revealing this hidden world. In what could be a case of out of the frying pan into the fire, Greece’s Prime Minister is back home trying to persuade people there to back the new bailout plan agreed yesterday with other EU states. Greek MPs will have to vote on the proposals by the end of tomorrow, but some members of the governing coalition have already said they won’t back Alexis Tsipras. In Brussels, the talk there is about how any rescue package is going to be paid for. Let’s go live now to our correspondent, johnny Dymond. There was talk of raiding a pot that included some UK money? That’s right, Simon. A huge bailout deal that was sealed here yesterday morning after those marathon negotiations will take some time to get money to Greece, approximately five weeks. In the next few days, there are huge loan repayments due, so the search is on to find cash rather urgently for Greece, around 10 billion euros or £7 billion. There was an idea that a fund that Britain had contributed to back in 2010 might be raided to get hold of that cash quickly. As he went into a meeting of Euro Finance Ministers, George Osborne, the Chancellor, said that was not going to happen. He said Britain is not a part of the euro, the idea that British taxpayers should pay towards a bailout was ""a complete non-starter"". British taxpayers can sleep easy. The real problem is, where that money for Greece that is so urgently needed is going to be found. Thank you. A review into allegations of neglect at care homes in south-east Wales has concluded that prosecutions should have been brought against some of the home owners. It follows the failure of Operation jasmine, which investigated six homes, cost £15 million, but resulted in no prosecutions. Here’s our Wales correspondent, Hywel Griffiths. Victims of a system that didn’t care. These are the frail, elderly residents whose families say were denied basic humane treatment because of the greed of the homes involved. 76-year-old Stanley Bradford lost so much weight when he went into care his family say he became skeletal, they say he was a victim of neglect. It breaks our heart to think there were no nurses assigned to the floor that my grandfather was on. Other than having the visitors that visited every day family members, he was left alone, you know, and that is a long time to be left alone in pain and suffering. The investigation into the care at six homes in South Wales started in 2005, all are now under new management. A team of 75 officers worked on the case and identified 63 suspicious deaths as well as dozens of potential victims. The cost of the investigation swelled to a total of £15 million. This warehouse was used to hold the thousands of statements and pieces of evidence they gathered but in 2010, the CPS decided there wasn’t enough evidence to prove that there had been gross negligence. Three years later, the case against this care home owner was dropped after he suffered brain damage in an attack. But the author of today’s review says the case dragged on for far too long and evidence such as pressure ulcers on the bodies of residents should have been enough to secure convictions. They are excruciatingly painful, they are inaccurately referred to as ""bed sores"" and yet residents were being admitted to hospital via A&E where even the clinicians were appalled at all that they saw. The Director of Public Prosecutions will now have to decide if these people’s stories need to be heard again and if, after a decade, their families have been given justice. The gender pay gap in the UK is the fifth widest in Europe, according to figures out today. Today the Government said it’s pressing ahead with plans for force large firms to be more transparent about the gender pay gap. Elizabeth Glinka reports. It is a battle that’s been raging for decades, the fight by female co-workers at Ford’s Dagenham plant in the late 1960s led to the passing of the Equal Pay Act in 1970. But A5 years on, and the gap remains. Today, the Prime Minister vowed to change that within a generation. What we need to do is now identify where the gender pay gap is, and then work out how best to deal with its causes. And so this proposal for greater transparency, I think, is an important step along the way. If we’ve got the transparency and we can see in every company how big the gap is, and we are transparent about it, you can then start asking yourself, what can we do and what can the government do to try to close this gap? But realising that goal is still a major challenge. Whilst the gap is currently smaller than it has been since records began in 1997, the figures show that, on average, men are still earning 9.4% more than women in full-time work. The campaigners say they welcome today’s news. But the devil is in the detail. If you just publish a pay gap, the gap between the median of women’s pay the median of men’s pay won’t make much difference. What we need is much more detail byjob, the detail including overtime and bonuses, so that men and women can properly compare their pay. Critics argue that life choices play a major part in determining a person’s earning potential, but the goal of equal pay for equal work is one that businesses are being asked to embrace. A consultation on the detail of the regulations will now begin. The BBC’s Director General has launched a robust defence of the Corporation’s programming amid claims that it has strayed from its public service remit. The BBC’s annual report was published this morning and Tony Hall talked about the broadcaster’s duty to entertain, as well as educate and inform. The report comes two days before the Government publishes a Green Paper on the BBC’s future. More and more of us are paying for things using ‘tap and pay’. Now Apple has joined the world of contactless payments, introducing new technology that will allow customers to use its iPhones. And unlike the current method, some outlets have said the current £20 limit won’t apply. Here’s our technology correspondent, Rory Cellan-jones. Once you would never consider leaving home without cash. Now, cards are becoming indispensable, but soon will a mobile phone all that you need? Can I get three coffees and a bacon roll, please? The Apple Pay system is designed with that in mind. You upload your card details on to the phone, then when you want to pay you prove it is you with a fingerprint and tap it against a contactless terminal. While it worked here, I had a few issues elsewhere. It is not working. Why is it not working? Are we looking at a cash-free future? I think it is going to be a long time before we see the end of cash. But we definitely do see people embracing technology. It will be some time before we can leave everything behind, but it is interesting how quickly you see consumers embracing new ways to pay. Apple isn’t the only game in town here, there are other new ways of paying for things. I have used this sticker on the back of my phone to buy a bacon roll. The real revolution is ""contactless"" cards and they are changing the way we pay. Contactless payments have sored. We used this method 100 million times in 2013 and that rose to 319 million last year. While cash is on the wane, it still accounts for more than half of all consumer payments. Some retailers and customers prefer cash, but habits are changing rapidly. I was against it when it was contactless payment, but it is much easier and convenient. I don’t think it will be a problem. It is the way that the world is doing. -- going. You rely on one device for everything. I couldn’t see myself using just my phone for paying for stuff because of the security side. You will be able to buy most things with your phone, but there are some essential items which Apple Pay won’t get you. Time for a look at the weather with john Hammond. That is not here, is it?

And the open approach as Tiger Woods warns that the St Andrews wind could be the players’ toughest opponent. Good evening. Talks between six world powers and Iran, which began nine years ago, have finally ended in a deal to limit and monitor the country’s nuclear activity in return for a lifting of economic sanctions. President Obama said the agreement would make the world safer, while Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, said it opened a new chapter in his country’s relations with the world. But Israel has called the deal a mistake of historic proportions. Let’s join our diplomatic correspondent james Robbins, who’s been following the talks in Vienna. ~ I don’t know if there is anyway we can get hold of them. Governments call these family photos. They rarely tell such a remarkable story. Who would have thought Iran’s Foreign Minister would be centre stage after all the years of international isolation, smiling and joking with the world’s powers, and all because they have finally done the nuclear deal. We have stopped this spread of nuclear weapons in this region. Because of this deal, the international community will be able to verify that the Islamic Republic of Iran will not be able to develop nuclear weapons. Some may say Wâ8poIâ1S. SOITIE may Say today Some may say today that Iran has been deterred from making a nuclear bomb, but the whole world knows that making a bomb is wrong, that it is inhumane and forbidden. Iran has never pursued that path, and never will. The deal means that Iran has committed to scaling down its nuclear programme substantially, pushing back the day it would be able to build a bomb if it ever decided to do so. Iran will also accept intrusive monitoring by UN inspectors from its atomic agency, based here in Vienna. They use a host of sealed surveillance equipment in facilities around the world. I have been shown the latest acquitted cameras, ready for use in Iran, sending back thejust acquitted cameras, ready for use in Iran, sending back the just checked that are being kept. The deal with Iran places strict limits on the amount of enriched uranium it can produce an store. The aim is to prevent Iran producing the quantities it would need if it went for the ball. The heavy water research reactor, capable of reducing weapons grade plutonium, has to be converted so it can no longer do so. UN atomic inspectors will have access to visit all of Iran’s nuclear facilities. If they certify that Iran is sticking to the deal, then many, not all, international sanctions on Iran will be lifted. Now that news is hitting the streets of Tehran, and many Iranians are delighted. TRANSLATION: As an Iranian, of course I am happy. It has been 12 years of sanctions. Finally we have reached a deal. TRANSLATION: Finally we have the strength to deal with other powerful nations, and ourselves be a power in the world. So why is this such a big moment? To understand that, we have to go back over 35-year is to the Iranians revolution and Ayatollah Khomeini’s triumphant return from exile. It was a most incredible scene. Nobody could possibly know how many millions lined the route of his 20 Mile Drive through Tehran. Ayatollah Khomeini was about to take power as supreme leader of the new Islamic Republic of Iran. It was a moment in 1979 when the United States and her allies lost control of Iran. Years of Western interference were over, and relations went from bad to worse. Revolutionary students overran the American embassy and held more than 50 Americans hostage for over a year. So could this deal change the whole course of history? Tonight I asked American Secretary of State john Kerry Washington and Iran could now work together against a shared enemy, I also called Islamic State. We have no idea what the future holds with respect to any kind of deal. This is a nuclear agreement. We know that whatever it activities Iran is engaged in today would be far more empowered and more of a challenge to the global community if they had a nuclear weapons. This is pretty simple stuff. Simple stuff it may be, but getting this deal was anything but. And now agreement faces the test of both sides delivering what they have promised. james Robbins, BBC News, Vienna. So, is the Iran nuclear deal likely to make the Middle East a safer place? Our diplomatic correspondent Bridget Kendall has this assessment. For the West, the end of over a decade of painful negotiations under three different Iranians Presidents. First, the reformer, then the hardline Ahmadinejad who wanted to wipe Israel off the map. And finally another moderate, the current president, Rouhani. But not everyone is hailing it as a breakthrough. Some believe an already militarised Iran willjust get stronger and more dangerous. In a decade, this deal will give an unreformed, unrepentantand a decade, this deal will give an unreformed, unrepentant and far richer terrorist regime with a capacity to produce many nuclear bombs. Infact, an entire nuclear arsenal with the means to deliver it. What a stunning historic mistake. Iran has always been a pivotal power in the Middle East. Whatever Israel’s fears now, the worry which drove this deal was that if Iran wasn’t stopped from getting nuclear weapons, if Iran wasn’t stopped from getting nuclearweapons, it nuclear weapons, it could trigger a nuclear arms race in one of the world’s most volatile regions. just look at the map. Iraq has been in term while since the US-led invasion in 2003. Syria is in fragments, torn apart by civil war. Yemen has also now erupted into multiple conflicts. Israel sees Iran is the mortal enemy, a hostility which, like Israel’s decades-old tensions with its Arab neighbours, looks no closer to being resolved, and in the last echoed also, a new fault line has emerged. The Sunni kingdoms of the Gulf states fear Iran’s Shia government are trying to dominate the region. But Iran says it hopes today’s deal can make a new beginning. We want to engage with our neighbours, and we call on our neighbours to set aside illusions about being able to portray Iran as a threat and start engaging seriously with Iran. In theory, they all face a common foe, the so called Islamic State jihadist to threaten the entire Middle East and through their propaganda videos, well beyond. But deep mistrust won’t easily be turned into a new unity. Bridget Kendall, BBC News. Our North America Editorjon Sopel is in Washington. The US Congress has got to vote on this deal, and there’s resistance from some - could it get blocked? Well, the president has said that he is looking forward to a robust debate with Congress, and in a world of uncertainties, I think that is the one thing you can be sure of. There has been a chorus of criticism today from Republican congressmen and women about the deal, they are worried about the verification process, the lifting of the arms embargo, they are worried about what happens in 10-years’ embargo, they are worried about what happens in 10-years’ time, and ultimately what concerns them is that this isn’t the dismantling of Iran’s nuclear programme, it is merely halting its proliferation. And so there is strong opposition. Theoretically, Congress could stop this deal, but it is highly unlikely without getting lost in the constitutional knotweeds of procedure. Barack Obama has spoken to David Cameron, and they have agreed that the world is a safer place as a result of the deal, and that Iran won’t be able to develop a nuclear weapon, that Iran won’t be able to develop a nuclearweapon, but nuclear weapon, but it is the people at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue that he has to persuade, and thatis Avenue that he has to persuade, and that is going to take a lot of backslapping and arm-twisting. Ivn. backslapping and arm-twisting. jon, many thanks. jon Sopel there. A coroner has said that three reserve its who died on an SAS exercise on the Brecon Beacons would still be alive if precautionary measures had been taken. The coroner criticised the chaotic response after the men collapsed, and said a failure of basic medical care and contributed to their deaths. jonathan Beale was at the inquest. The Brecon Beacons has long been the testing ground for the elite SAS. We joined a group following in their footsteps. The same 16-mile march against the clock carrying more than 50 lbs. But two years ago, a march like this ended in tragedy. It put a blot on the British Army. I still get tearful, and I always will get tearful. I’m just. .. It’s so hard... when you do hear the failings. I just don’t want it to happen again. His son, james Dunsby, along with fellow reservists Edward Maher and Craig Roberts were described in court as marvellous, fit men with a do-or-die attitude, taken down at the height of their ambition. The weather on the Beacons can change in an instant. Two years ago it was the hottest day of the year. The coroner listed the gross failings, not enough water, no proper risk assessment or rescue plan in place. Unlike the regulars, the reservists had not been given time to prepare on the mountains. When men went down with heat illness, there was a chaotic response. By the time the emergency services arrived, it was already too late. Reaching a conclusion of neglect, the coroner said it had been a serious of very serious mistakes and failings. The Army had failed to properly manage and organise the march, and if it had followed the MoD’s own guidance, the march should have been stopped, and all three soldiers would have survived. Like the others, james Dunsby, who had served in Afghanistan alongside Prince Harry, was wearing a GPS tracker. But they didn’t notice he had stopped for more than an hour. just one of the failings his wife heard in court.

We have already made a number of changes to the exercise in terms of the way it is run. james Dunsby’s father has returned to the Beacons to complete the march his son never finished. His hope is that this will never happen again. jonathan Beale, BBC News. A vote on a relaxing the fox hunting laws in England and Wales has been stoned after the SNP said they would oppose the changes which would have meant almost certain defeat for the Government. Nicola Sturgeon defended the decision to vote on an issue which doesn’t affect Scotland, saying the Conservatives had shown little respect for her party since the election. Carole Walker reports. No more torture, no more fear... Opponents of hunting gathered outside Parliament to voice their opposition doctor plans to relax the restrictions on fox hunting in England. The vote was abandoned when the Scottish and this reverse their previous position and said they would vote against them, leaving the Government facing defeat. The issue is on hold at least until the rules are changed to giving your a shame people s a greater say on English-only laws. -- people s a greater say on English-only laws. -- giving English MPs a greater say on English-only laws. He has had to pull those proposals as well as now having to all the fox hunting proposals. That underlines that David Cameron is not master of all he surveys in the House of Commons. He has a fragile majority. Hunting has long had strong views on both sides, and this has become a constitutional row, too, over how our Parliament works and who gets to vote on the laws of the land. The position of the SNP has always been clear, which is that they do not vote on matters that are purely of interest to England or England and Wales, particularly if they have already settled that issue in Scotland. So I find their position today entirely opportunistic. Underthe opportunistic. Under the Government’s plans, opportunistic. Underthe Government’s plans, Scottish MPs will be extruded from parts of the parliamentary process for laws which only affect England. But they will get to vote along with every other MP before any law is passed, so they could still scupper any future Government moves to change the hunting rules in England. It is now very clear that these MPs who can’t even vote on hunting in their own constituencies because it is devolved to the Scottish Parliament think it is fair enough to poke their noses into the issues as they affect English constituencies, and that will say to a lot of people watching this programme that there is a big imbalance in our Constitution. Government wanted to bring English hunting laws in line with those in Scotland to allow an unlimited number of hounds to flush out their prey. But this is to notjust number of hounds to flush out their prey. But this is to not just about the fate of foxes, north or south of the border. It is a struggle for power in the new political landscape. Harold Walker, BBC News, Westminster. Our top story this evening. A landmark deal has been reached limiting Iran’s nuclear programme in exchange for the easing of sanctions. Could you use these to pay for most Later on BBC London: The artist arrested for charging his phone on an overground train, and why transport bosses say what he did was dangerous. And, the London veteran who played a key role in the D-day landings, on receiving France’s highest military honour. More than three billion miles from Earth, NASA’s space probe, New Horizons, is flying past Pluto - nine-and-a-half years after its launch. It’s already sent back these images, and scientists hope the information could transform their understanding of the far reaches of our solar system. Our science editor, David Shukman, reports from mission headquarters in Maryland. Nine, eight, seven, six... Counting down to the first encounter with the distant world of Pluto. The moment that years of planning and waiting have at last paid off. The atmosphere is incredible. There is a great sense of achievement at getting the spacecraft the three billion miles to Pluto, but also the sheer excitement of witnessing and sharing a moment of discovery. It was nearly a decade ago that the New Horizons spacecraft set off for Pluto, and views which began blurred soon became sharper and sharper, sights that have never been possible until now. And today we received this image, which shows a bizarre surface of pale and dark features. It’s an active world, and this is how the scientists reacted when their picture came in. With far better close-ups due tomorrow, they can’t quite believe they’ve got this far. There are rare times when you get to do something that’s larger than life, and the exploration of the farthest world that humans have ever explored, the completion of the initial reconnaissance of the solar system, that sounds like science fiction, but it’s not. Today, we flew by Pluto. And tomorrow, the presents start landing. Images and spectra and data that’ll write the textbook. Pluto was only a speck of light when it was spotted back in 1930, the work of a young astronomer called Clyde Tombaugh. He’s since died, but some of his ashes have been carried on the spacecraft as it shoots past Pluto. And today his son was here at mission control and told me of his pride. A little piece of dad is going to the planet that he discovered and then on into the universe forever. How does that feel to you and your family? Absolutely fantastic. It’s a thrill. The fly- past happened with astonishing accuracy, the spacecraft aiming for a particular point in space to give the cameras and instruments the best possible views. Until now, we’ve had to rely on artists’ impressions of Pluto. What’s promised for tomorrow are the first detailed images of this distant edge of the solar system. After the excitement there is an anxious wait to check if the spacecraft has survived the fly it is past, there is a small risk it may have hit rock or dust. We won’t know until the next signal comes in. That is not due until the early hours, yourtime. Assuming hours, your time. Assuming everything hours, yourtime. Assuming everything has gone well, we will get those first historic close-ups of Pluto during tomorrow. Many thanks, David. Lorry drivers at Calais who are heading to Britain will be able to wait in a new 'secure zone’ to help stop illegal migrants boarding their vehicles. The area will be able to hold 230 lorries at any one time - that’s the equivalent of a two-and-a-half mile queue. Home Secretary Theresa May said more than 8,000 attempts to travel into the country had been intercepted by officials in the last three weeks. Magdalena Luczak, the mother of murdered four-year-old Daniel Pelka, has died in prison. She was jailed for life at Birmingham Crown Court two years ago, along with her partner. Daniel, who had been starved and tortured, weighed just over a stone-and-a-half when he died from a head injury. Inflation -the rate at which prices rise - was flat at 0% injune. Falls in clothing and food prices were the main reason. The Bank of England says inflation is likely to remain low in the immediate short-term, but is likely to rise around the end of the year. The BBC’s Director General has launched a robust defence of the Corporation’s programming, saying the BBC has a duty to entertain as well as to educate and inform. Tony Hall spoke at the release of the Corporation’s annual report, which comes two days before the Government sets out proposals on the BBC’s future, as well as that of the licence fee. Our home editor, Mark Easton, has the story. For hopes... The winner is... And dreams... The BBC has launched a fightback against what it sees as commercial and ideological enemies in Government and the media. Amid suggestions the Corporation should stop making popular entertainment shows, the Director General has said the BBC’s commitment to serve all audiences is non-negotiatable. When you ask the people who pay for us, the people whose voice must be really important in the future of the BBC, ask them what they want from the BBC. Of course, they want information. Of course, they want education, but they also want entertainment. They want Strictly, they want The Voice, they want Bake Off. But a commercial broadcaster could make The Voice or Strictly, those kind of programmes, why should the BBC make them? Look, this model, in this country, gives us the best broadcasting on radio and in television in the world. Research published by the Corporation today shows 97% of UK adults use the BBC every week. 64% of people say BBC services are relevant to people like them, up from 59%. And, asked to choose words they associate with the BBC mission. The top three echo the first Director General Lord Reith’s founding vision, with the most popular being - to entertain. It was an extremely difficult, largely disappointing time. How would Lord Reith have responded to the critics who point out the BBC now employs 81 senior managers who earn more than the Prime Minister? And last year, three or four top TV presenters who between them took home more than £5 million. The Government and media moguls are demanding the BBC revisit its Reithian mission. It’s just not reasonable that viewers should be expected to pay, through what amounts to a poll tax, for entertainment programming of exactly the same kind as commercial broadcasters provide either through subscription or through advertising. People are being sent to prison because they don’t want to pay for programming like The Voice, which has no real public value. In a BBC Radio interview last year, the Prime Minister was asked what he thought. You can’t have BBC One without having shows like Strictly and EastEnders because you’ve got to have a mixture of, as I say, making the popular good, but also making the good popular. On Thursday though the Government’s expected to suggest the BBC should do less entertainment and more public service and education programmes. What the Director General has described as the big choice about the BBC’s future has now begun. Mark Easton, BBC News. Chris Froome has won Stage 10 of the Tour de France. The Team Sky rider broke away with 7km to go before the first summit finish of this year’s race to win in style in La Pierre-Saint-Martin. He now has an overall lead of almost theree minutes, with 11 stages left to go. More and more of us are using contactless payments - the technology that let’s us tap-and-pay. Now, Apple has gone one step further, allowing customers to use its iPhones to make a purchase. Rory Cellan-jones is in West London. Is this a sign of things to come? There will be more an more ways of paying with your phone. Apple Pay is one of them. I have been using the service. Let us hope it works this time. Let us see if we can make it work. Can I pay for these grapes. Sure. Thank you. I press my thumb against there. I press it on there. Amazing. Authorised. Please wait. It’s gone through. It’s worked this time. What this is about is contactless technology. There are 250,000 retailers across the UK able to use Apple Pay at the moment they have the contactless terminals. There has been an explosion in the use of contactless payments. 300 million payments last year. Three times the number the year before. Cash is still popular with a lot of people. More than half of all consumer payments still made by cash. That is falling quite rapidly. Let us get two views on this. Dave Birch you are a digital money expert. Is this the way of the future. Have we to use our phones to pay for everything, why would we want to? It will be the key to payments. They are bringing chip and PIN security inside the phone and on the internet as well. It’s really big. It’s not only about Apple. No, Google and Samsung are coming down this path. Not everyone will be happen which with this? It’s exciting for the technology buffs. We have to keep an eye on how do people use it and keep track of their spending? People who haven’t got so much money will they keep track of what they have spent and pouch money they have left? -- how much. Apple is a wealthy and powerful company. Some people will ask - powerful company. Some people will ask - do we want them to have power over our money and know what they are spending. They say it’s secret. There will be questions about that. Thank you very much. Now a look at the he weather. Here’s Matt Taylor. A breakthrough on its way. Cloud across the southern half of the UK producing rain and drizzle. Foggy through the night. Heavy showers to the east of Scotland, the north-east England. Most will ease away. Another morning of contrasts. Temperatures in mid teens to the north. A cool night to the south, sorry. A cool night to the north. We will start with the cool conditions, sunshine to greet the day for many of you. The southern half of the UK will be grey, misty and damp conditions. The north-south split into tomorrow morning. Southern areas, the coasts in the south could be misty and foggy, rain or drizzle. The cloud will thin and break. Sunshine coming through setting off a few showers inland from the south coast, misty and murky towards the Channel Islands. North of that good, long sunny spells throughout the day. Showers few and far between. Pleasant and comfortable the further north you are. Clear skies here and there. Misty to the south. This low pressure system pushes into the west into Thursday, bringing outbreaks of rain to Northern Ireland and western Scotland. Dragging in a south-east wind. The low cloud will break up. Hazy sunshine for many. The heat returns. 26 to 28 degrees, 82 Fahrenheit to the north and west of London. Coolerfurther Fahrenheit to the north and west of London. Cooler further north. We will end the day here with heavy rain. Thunderstorms during Thursday night across England and Wales. They will push northwards, Friday, a wet day to the north of Scotland. Sunshine and blustery showers to the rest of Scotland, Northern Ireland and northern England. Dryer further south. Windy across the broad with windy conditions for the northern half of the UK.

And, the award-winning actor Chewitel Ejiofor on returning to the London stage where his love of acting began. Welcome to BBC London News, with me, Riz Lateef. It’s been revealed that more than 100 pupils in Tower Hamlets have disappeared from school registers without any indication of where they are. It’s led to fears that they could be vulnerable and at risk of extremist influences. The discovery was made in an ongoing investigation into Islamist radicals targeting east London schools. The schools watchdog, Ofsted, now wants the Government to tighten the law on how children who leave school are monitored. Here’s our education reporter, Marc Ashdown. Fears of a Trojan horse. This may have proved unfounded but the concern some schools are failing to protect children from extremism go on. Ofsted has been monitoring seven schools in Tower Hamlets. Today it raised serious safeguarding those which could affect all schools in England. Writing to the Education Secretary, the Chief Inspector Of Schools said inspectors found this. And that schools only gave generic reasons. So, how many children could be at risk? Ofsted says, last year in Tower Hamlets, 428 pupils were moved from schools during term time. Of those, in 109 cases, they are not certain about their whereabouts. Where could they have gone? This Tower Hamlets backstreet gives a clue. This used to be a private tuition centre where parents would send pupils after school for additional classes in Islamic studies. But this had become a fully fledged school which is illegal. It was raided by anti-terrorist police and shut down. -i-i’IâIââ BFE ITI8I’Iy ITIOI’â. This parent thinks in many cases it could simply be a cultural breakdown. Maybe in the elder communities they don’t know how to communicate, It could be a lack of communication. They can explain to them. Of the seven schools inspected, one has been praised for making huge improvements. But concerns remain about six independent Islamic schools and what they are teaching their children. They were inspected last autumn and there is very little improvement. I think it is very worrying, not least of which, three of them are connected to hardline mosques within the borough. We need to investigate what is going on in the mosques and schools. Tower Hamlets Council said it accepts the concerns raised but quite rightly says it is an issue for all schools. And Marc’s here now. How concerned should we be? There is no evidence any child or children are missing or in danger. It is the fact they are not certain and this gives rise to concern. What Ofsted is trying to say is to the Government, never mind the schools requiring improvement, the law needs you to get a better grip to minimise risks to children. These recommendations came in ten years ago. They say they need to look at the risks children face, child sexual exploitation, falling prey to radicalisation, big modern-day concerns which is why they say it is vital heads should collect information where children go when they are removed from school. What will the Government response be? I have spoken to the advisers of the Education Secretary who say she is taking it very seriously. She will be proactive and it is likely she will she new guidance by the end of the week for schools to work on and mitigate these risks in the short term. Long-term, she will look to tighten the law which will require consultation over summer. And by autumn, September, some new rules, perhaps even requiring schools by law to seek this information on where a child is going, and what information they can get on what powers they have if there is a refusal. He played a key role in the D-Day landings. We meet the London veteran who’s about to receive France’s highest military honour. The sight I shall never forget, and I get so emotional... Was the sight of bodies like rag dolls being blown off the ship. An air accident report investigating the emergency landing of a British Airways plane at Heathrow two years ago says aircraft engineers may have been so tired that they failed to notice they had worked on the wrong plane. It also criticised cabin crew for not acting on concerns from passengers who saw fuel leaking and engine covers fall off. Katharine Carpenter reports. Within minutes of their take-off from Heathrow, BA passengers bound for Oslo saw this out of the aeroplane window. The doors of the engines had ripped off. As the plane gained speed and got faster, it started to flap and lift more. At the moment of take-off, we were a couple of metres in the air, it flew off, broke off and hit the fuselage, made quite a loud noise. As the plane returned to Heathrow for an emergency landing, a fuel leak caused one of the engines to catch fire. It turned out engineers carrying out routine maintenance the previous day had left the engine doors unlatched. They were meant to finish the job later, but returned to the wrong plane at continued work on that one by mistake. Today, the Air Accident Investigation Branch released its report into the incident. It said the maintenance staff may have been overtired because of staff shortages, and said cabin crew did not relay passenger concerns of what they could see to the flight deck. Its recommendations include that Airbus should introduce a warning system which detects if the engine doors aren’t shut properly, and it says a fatigue risk management system should be brought in for maintenance staff. Lots of people made lots of small mistakes. It all added up to something which was very embarrassing. But it was never going to cause that aeroplane to fall out of the sky. It was very unlikely to hurt anybody except during the emergency evacuation. But it is true that British Airways and its employees did need to sharpen up their act somewhat. The airline told us it had already taken action. The passengers and crew were evacuated from the plane using emergency slides. No one was hurt. It is hoped today’s report will spare others a similar ordeal. Nine people have been arrested, following a shooting which left a man dead and a woman critically injured in north London last Friday. The incident happened on Lordship Lane in Wood Green. Police say the victims were innocent bystanders. Police say five men, two women and two teenage boys remain in custody. Three men have been arrested on suspicion of being involved in the preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. One man in his 20s was arrested in Letchworth in Hertfordshire, and a further two men in Luton. The Met Police say the arrests are part of an ongoing investigation into Islamist-related terrorism. Tributes have been paid to an ""extremely popular and gifted"" London schoolboy who died during a rugby tour in Canada over the weekend. 17-year-old jamal Ottun was swimming with team-mates in Shawnigan Lake on Vancouver Island when he vanished from view. Paramedics tried to revive him, but he died on Sunday afternoon. jamal was a pupil at Wallington County Grammar School in Sutton, and was on the two-week rugby tour to mark the end of term. jamaal was my brother and I never imagined life without him. I can honestly say he lived his life to the fullest. Not only was he an inspiration to my family and I, but to everyone around him. He was a source ofjoy which will be deeply missed. We love you so much, jamaal. We pray that you will forever rest in peace. Londoners face another 2lI-hour Tube strike next month, with three unions now saying their members will walk out on the evening of Wednesday 5th August. The dispute is over the introduction of an all-night service at weekends. Our transport correspondent Tom Edwards is here. This is fresh off the back of last week’s strike? Here we go Here WE QD again, surprise. This dispute is a long way from being resolved. Aslef and the Unite union said they would go out on August the at 9:30pm, the 21+ hours. Today, the RMT said it was also going to go out on the same day. That means because Aslef and RMT represent all the tube drivers it means the whole of the Tube will be shut the 21+ hours. So, what is Transport for London saying about this? They say they have made a fair and reasonable offer on pay. The problem here is it isn’tjust about one issue which is the introduction of the night Tube, there are other grievances mixed in. It is about cuts to station staff, work -life balance, rosters, pay. With four unions involved, it makes it harder to get a deal. There were talks today. But no resolution, not surprising. More talks tomorrow, hopefully with three weeks that is enough time for them to sort it out. When West Ham Football Club moves to the Olympic Stadium at the end of next season, its current ground, Upton Park will be turned into homes. But people living nearby, including schoolchildren, are taking on the property developer, who they say is failing to provide enough affordable housing. Our reporter Anjana Gadgil has the story. CHANTING They turn activist early in east London. Year six pupils marching through West Ham this morning, the stadium is being turned into flats once the football club moves to the Olympic Park. What do we want? Affordable houses. The children say more homes are needed for people like them. Not everyone can afford to live in really nice places that are posh. And especially in Newham, it is important for me because I live here. Affordable housing might affect our future because a lot of young people are on the streets. They need to be in houses. West Ham sold the Boleyn to developers Galliard who will build 838 homes. 6% will be affordable but none will be social homes, in a borough with one of the longest waiting lists for social housing in the country. We have seen a few families from our school move out at short notice, and had to move out of their homes they are in, to move somewhere else, with the uncertainty and insecurity which has impacted on their learning and family life. The plans go against Newham Council’s pledge that affordable homes make up 35% of new developments. They’d better come back with more social housing otherwise planning will reject it. I came out and said it was ridiculous, why on earth would we agree a development with zero social housing? They will have to get real. I come back again and say to get the kind of numbers in the Olympic Village you need subsidy from the Government. Neither Galliard nor West Ham would speak today but with West Ham paying £15 million for a £217 million cost to convert the Olympic Stadium, people at Upton Park want a better deal for their community too. Still to come this evening: The award-winning actor Chewitel Ejiofor, on returning to the London theatre where his passion for acting began. It seems summer has been switched off but it is temporary, we have warmer air moving towards us at the end of the week. Those details at the end of the programme. An artist from Islington has criticised transport police, after he was arrested for using a plug on a London overground train to charge his iPhone. Robin Lee was handcuffed and put into a police van, after using the power socket on a journey from Hackney to Camden last week. But transport bosses say his actions posed a safety risk. Here’s Ayshea Buksh. Robin Lee was on an overcrowded train when the phone on his batter was fasding fast. He plugged it into the nearest socket but did not expect to be pulled off the train. I met him with my BBC smartphone outside the station where it happened. They brought me down the stairs, wouldn’t let me touch my card out, my hands were behind my back. They brought me up here with a police officer on each arm. I waited here for ten minutes, then they put me in the van and took me to the police station. The artist from Islington says he feels he did nothing wrong. I have seen a lot of people using electricity on overnight trains and did not think it was a problem. I can’t see why it should be. British Transport Police confirmed Robin Lee was arrested on suspicion of abstructing electricity. He was further arrested for unacceptable behaviour. Trains have fluctuation electricity levels and although it is not illegal to use the socket it does pose a risk. Which is why stickers say, not for public use. TfL explained the sockets are used by cleaner into them when the trains are stationary in the depot. Other travellers I spoke to were not wholly sympathetic about fight. Have you charged your smartphone on the train? No, I wouldn’t. It has a sign you’re not allowed to. Have you been tempted to charge your phone on these trains? No, if my battery goes, it goes. On the high-speed train from Kent it is normal to plug it in. I don’t see any reason why you can’t here. They are not saying anything. There is a plug hole. There was no indication you can’t use it. There’s no indication that says you can. But there is nothing to say you can’t. Robin was eventually released without charge. He is defiant, if he needs to, he will plug in again. It’s a special day for two London veterans in their nineties who are to receive France’s highest military honour at a special event this evening. They’re being recognised for their part in the D-Day landings in 191+1+ during the Second World War. Victoria Hollins is at the French Ambassador’s residence in Kensington where the awards will be presented. As you can see, As YOU CSI’] SEE, YOU CSI’] i’1â8I’ As you can see, you can hear and see the dignitaries arriving. The French ambassador is still welcoming people. 1500 people to Mark French national day, and to listen to the French ambassador who will pay tribute to British war veterans receiving a special honour. Amongst them this evening, john from Orpington who I am told has not been able to make it this evening. And 19 eight-year-old Michael-- 98-year-old Michael Noss. Michael has waited 70 years for this. To add to his precious service medals with France’s highest award. I am over the moon. I’m really happy. The only thing I regret very much is the impossibility, the fact they cannot be issued posthumously. He joined the Royal Engineers atjust 23. Four years later injune 191+1+, he like thousands of other British troops, found himself part of the D-Day landings, a perilousjourney from the moment they left Dover. We were sailing, and port side there was another ship almost identical. And... They got a direct hit. just 50 yards away. A sight I should never forget, I get so emotional. It was the sight of bodies like rag dolls being blown off the ship. By the grace of God there go I. Michael says his mind is still blank about how he made it to shore at juno Beach when thousands did not. All the time there was one big incentive to keep fighting, 70 members of his jewish family already dead. They were all murdered by the Nazis. They were all murdered. And I was thinking, I wanted to avenge what had happened. I count myself as being very fortunate to have been there. It was only last year that France began awarding the Legion of Honour to British soldiers. Around 3000 are eligible. It is to honour people for acts of bravery. And we know we owe our freedom and security to these men. It was a war to end all wars. It didn’t happen. I did think of it then. Will they remember the sacrifices made by thousands and thousands of young boys? They are all being remembered here this evening, not these by families who are extremely proud of what they are being awarded with. But also by the British and the French. It is important to say when I was listening to Michael, his wife was there and she said afterwards and said, in over 60 years of marriage, she had never heard him talk about some of those things, which had been buried for a long time. Tonight he is an extremely proud man. What an honour to meet him and share his experiences. He made his name as a stage actor but shot to fame in his award-winning performance in the 12 Years A Slave. Now, Londoner Chewitel Ejiofor has returned to the National Theatre after a 15-year break, the very place where his of love of acting began, as he’s been telling our arts correspondent, Brenda Emmanus. He was nominated at the Oscars and won a BAFTA for his role in Steve McOueen’s landmark film 12 Years A Slave. His return to the National Theatre after a 15-year absence presented him with another challenging role and more critical praise. He stars in the morality tale Every Man which is to be broadcast live in cinemas across the UK and worldwide. How important do you feel that theatre must reach a broader audience? It is crucial to the lifeblood of theatre, and to storytelling, narratives that can inform as well as entertain. It is part of cultural life. It should include the widest span of population as possible. In 2013, he appeared in this role of the Congolese leader in this production. He remained loyal to the theatre despite his Hollywood status. What was your earliest memories of theatre? I suppose my earliest experiences were at the National Theatre. I remember seeing Fiona Shaw here. Pinter. This was all with school parties, we’d come up here in the small dress circle. I had amazing experiences here. I suppose I didn’t even dare think at that point I would be on the stage, on this stage myself. He is on screen in a host of forthcoming projects including a remake of the Oscar-winning Argentinian thriller Secret In Their Eyes with julia Roberts and Nicole Kidman. But fans can savour his work in the cinema broadcast of Every Man. It is part of the National Theatre Live, this Thursday. Time now for a check on the weather with Sara Thornton. 21+ hours ago you said, where is summer? It is on its way back but it is a slow process. We will see signs of a change. Tomorrow will be brighter and it will warm up. A breeze will develop into the weekend. It brings warmer air for a time. Today has been another cloudy day although there have been some breaks. Temperatures last night where they should be about this time of year, 22 Celsius. We continue with the threat of light and patchy rain this evening. We lose that threat as we move into tomorrow morning. It stays cloudy. Towards the south, misty, muddy once more, 15 degrees. Tomorrow, are lots of dry weather and increasingly although you can see the threat of rain towards the north west, it breaks and we will see sunshine coming through in the afternoon. There is the risk of a shower. Most likely towards the south east. Possibly 25 Celsius. We are on our way up and it doesn’t stop there either. Overnight into Thursday, we start to see the winds change in direction into Thursday morning. It won’t make much of a difference because temperatures again 15 degrees with cloud. It does mean we will see warmer air coming in from the south east. Sunny spells for Thursday afternoon. Not all to wall but that southeasterly wind will move warmer air towards us from the near continent which will boost temperatures. If you get some sunshine on Thursday afternoon, it could be in the high 20s. Hazy sunshine with cloud around. Possibly 27 Celsius. You can see it is a bit cooler into Friday. Not glorious blue skies because this weather system will track up towards the north with a westerly wind on Friday. The winds will pick up but still a fine day but cooler and fresher at the weekend. The day’s main headlines. A deal has been reached between Iran and six world powers, which will see Iran’s nuclear programme curbed and monitored, in exchange for an end to sanctions on Tehran. It’s taken 12 years of negotiations. The MoD has said it is ""truly sorry"" after a coroner found that neglect played a part in the deaths of three Army reservists. They died from heat exhaustion after taking part in a trek on the hottest day of 2013. The Government has postponed a vote on relaxing the ban on fox hunting in England and Wales, after the Scottish National Party said it would oppose the changes. And three Tube unions have now said their members will walk out next month in dispute over the introduction of an all-night service at weekends. The 21+-hour Tube strike will start on the evening of Wednesday 5th August. That’s it, thanks forjoining us. I’ll be back with the latest during the Ten O’Clock News.

Tonight at Ten: Iran strikes a deal to limit its nuclear programme in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. Celebrations in Tehran tonight as leaders talk of a ‘new chapter of hope’ and recognition of Iran’s nuclear activity. I believe this is a historic moment. We are reaching an agreement that is not perfect for anybody, but it is what we could accomplish. It’s taken more than a decade to reach agreement and the Americans claim the Middle East is a safer place because of the deal. Today’s announcement marks one more chapter in this pursuit of a safer, more helpful and more hopeful world. But the Israelis have strongly criticised the agreement and Republicans in the US Congress have promised to oppose it. Also tonight: Neglect DID play a part in the deaths of three Army reservists who collapsed during an SAS exercise on the Brecon Beacons.

And the emergency landing of a plane at Heathrow - an investigation criticises aircraft engineers for mistakes. Good evening. The Iranians have signed an agreement after many years of negotiation which limits their nuclear activity in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. Iran described it as a ‘new chapter of hope’. President Obama said it would stop the spread of nuclear weapons in the Middle East, but the Israelis warned that the international community was making a ‘stunning, historic mistake’. The talks took place in Vienna and our diplomatic correspondent, james Robbins, is there tonight. When we met this afternoon, john Kerry told me there were times during this negotiation when he thought agreement might not be possible. It’s taken years of applying pressure on Iran to reduce, not to increase the scale of its nuclear capability. The prize for Iran, of course, the relief from some of the sanctions and the lifting of the burden of isolation. For many For ITI8I’Iy yoUI’Ig people For many young people in Tehran tonight, it’s as if sanctions have already been lifted. They see a brighter future for themselves and their country. Governments call these family photos. They rarely tell such a remarkable story. Who would have thought Iran’s Foreign Minister would be centre stage after all the years of international isolation. Smiling and joking with the world’s great powers and all because they finally have done a nuclear deal. In Tehran and Washington, both Presidents strode to the microphone to welcome the deal in very different ways. We have stopped the spread of nuclear weapons in this region. Because of this deal, the international community will be able to verify that the Islamic Republic of Iran will not develop a nuclear weapon. TRANSLATION: Some may say Iran has been deterred from making a nuclear bomb. The whole world knows that making a bomb is wrong, that it is inhumane and forbidden. Iran has never pursued that path and never will. The deal means that Iran has committed to scaling down its nuclear programme substantially, pushing back the day it would be able to build a bomb if it did ever decide to do so. Iran will also accept intrusive monitoring by UN Inspectors from its atomic agency based here in Vienna. They use a host of surveillance equipment to check that pledges are being kept. Today’s deal will cut the amount of enriched uranium Iran can produce. And the Arak reactor has to be converted. UN Inspectors will have access to all facilities. Sanctions will then be relaxed, that means releasing back to Iran $100 billion in frozen assets and ending a ban on energy sector imports. Iran is obliged to accept sanction also be restored if the deal isn’t kept. Why is this such a big moment? To understand that, we have to go back over 35 years, to the Iranian Revolution and the Supreme Leader’s return from exile. Nobody could know how many people lined the route of his drive through Tehran... He was about to take power as Supreme Leader of the new Islamic Republic of Iran. It was the most in 1979 when the United States and her allies lost control of Iran with the fall of the Shah. The years of Western interference were over and relations went from bad to worse. Revolutionary students overran the American Embassy and held more than 50 Americans hostage for over a year. So, could this deal change the course of history? I asked Secretary of State john Kerry if Washington and Iran could work together against a shared enemy, ISIL or Islamic State. This agreement is a nuclear agreement. We know that whatever activities Iran is engaged in today, would be far more empowered and more of a challenge to the global community if they had a nuclear weapon. This is pretty simple stuff. The momentjohn Kerry gets home, he faces strong opposition in Congress. That is why the deal we have out there, in my view, from what I know about this thus far, is unacceptable. It is going to hand a dangerous regime billions of dollars in sanctions relief while paving the way for a nuclear Iran. If getting this deal was anything but easy, what comes next is tough, too. Those who made the agreement now face the test of ensuring both sides deliver what they have promised. james Robbins, BBC News, Vienna. Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Hosseini Khamenei, has praised what he called the ‘honest and hard endeavours’ of the country’s negotiating team after the deal was struck in Vienna. One of the main negotiators was the Iranian Foreign Minister, Mohammad javad Zarif, and he’s been speaking to our chief international correspondent, Lyse Doucet. Life has been on hold in Iran as millions waited anxiously for news of a deal, news from the man who has come to symbolise Iran’s desire for a different relationship with the world. Don’t scream, smile, urged one headline this morning. He told me he saw a lesson in all this. Diplomacy can certainly prevail over that threat, and can produce better results because threats were used for so many years and two years of diplomacy trumped 30 years of pressure. You are heading home, where you have been hailed as a hero, and accused of being a traitor. Do you expect difficult battles at home? A good number of people in Iran have a different view, they do not see the world as I do, they do not see the outcome of these negotiations as I do. I hope this one will start to make a different impression in Iran, that people in fact can have an agreement with the West and the West is going to respect that agreement. Now Iranians want to see the dividends of this diplomacy. TRANSLATION: As an Iranian, I’m happy that after 12 years, sanctions will be lifted. TRANSLATION: It makes me really happy that now we are going to be a powerful player in the world. But that’s the next challenge. In our list of priorities, our region is the highest priority and we want to engage with our neighbours and we call on our neighbours to start engaging seriously. Iran is changing but no-one can say by how much, how much life will get easier, how much easier it will be to engage with a nation, with an identity all its own. Lyse Doucet, BBC News, Vienna. Some countries in the Middle East have given a broad welcome to the agreement. The United Arab Emirates, for example, said a new page was being turned. But the Israeli government has reacted with anger and hostility. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it would allow Iran to pursue its ‘expansion and aggression throughout the Middle East and across the globe’. Our Middle East editor, jeremy Bowen, considers the likely impact of the deal. The Middle East has been in turmoil since the Arab uprisings of 2011. The new agreement will change the region, perhaps a lot. But for better? Orforworse? Iran can region, perhaps a lot. But for better? Or for worse? Iran can still be a place where thousands chant about the deaths of America or Israel or Britain. This was Tehran last Friday, on a march supporting Palestinian rights injerusalem. We arranged to film the other side of Tehran, away from slogans and parades. Many, perhaps most Iranians, believe accepting some nuclear restrictions is worth it to end sanctions which have hit a new Iranian generation with economic, not revolutionary aspirations. In Israel, the Prime Minister’s office posted this video, in the run-up to the deal. Imagine Islamic State building atomic bombs... Claiming it would turn Iran into a turbo-charged ISIS, another name for the jihadist group, Islamic State, which Iran opposes. This deal will give an unreformed, unrepentant and far richer terrorist regime the capacity to produce many nuclear bombs, in fact an entire nuclear arsenal with a means to deliver it. What a stunning historic mistake. The Vienna agreement is another sign of profound change in the Middle East. Until 2011, the main conflict in the region was between friends of America and friends of Iran. Now Iran and the USA are talking, and agreeing. But don’t expect an automatic improvement. The US and Iran and both sets of their allies are involved in regional wars in Syria, Iraq and Yemen. Those crisis weren’t part of the Vienna talks. In Syria the Vienna powers are on opposite sides. Iran has spent billions supporting President Assad. The West wants him out. But in Iraq, the Iranians, the Americans and their friends are on the same side against Islamic State. Firmer co-operation might be possible now. Israel and Saudi Arabia are key Western allies. They’re also Iran’s most significant regional adversaries and believe the nuclear deal puts them in danger. The Vienna agreement could heat up Middle Eastern fault lines, especially the sectarian conflict between Shias and Sunnis, and the Saudi-Iranian cold war that helps drive it. Even though the Middle East is fractured by war, it would have been worse had the nuclear crisis ended with Israel bombing Iran as seemed possible two years ago. Avoiding thatis possible two years ago. Avoiding that is in itself a major diplomatic achievement. jeremy Bowen, BBC News. Our North America editor, jon Sopel, is in Washington. What is your reading of the mood in Congress and the appetite to block this? Well, there has been a torrent of criticism from the Republican leadership that the deal is lousy, that the President has given too much away, has gained too little in return from the Iranians. If that falls into the predictable category, what is more striking perhaps is the very mooted response from Democrats. There has been no popping of champagne corks. That sets the stage for a bitter debate over approving this. In the end, it will be approved. When President Obama came to the White House, he was very cautious on foreign affairs, he had seen his predecessors get burnt in the Middle East and he wanted none of it. On Iran he has gambled, first to get the deal and now to sell it. Tomorrow, we hear he is going to hold a news conference, he is reaching out to congressional leaders and he is hitting the phones. You do sense that this particular deal will be an important part of Barack Obama’s legacy. jon, many thanks. The coroner at the inquest into the deaths of three Army reservists, who collapsed during an SAS selection exercise on the Brecon Beacons, has found that failures by the organisers contributed to the deaths. Louise Hunt was giving a narrative verdict at the inquest of Lance Corporal Edward Maher, Lance Corporal Craig Roberts and Corporaljames Dunsby. They died during a march on the hottest day ofjuly 2013, as our defence correspondent, jonathan Beale, reports. The Brecon Beacons has long been the testing ground for the elite SAS. We joined a group following in their footsteps. The same 16-mile march against the clock, carrying more than 50lbs, but two years ago a march like this ended in tragedy. It put a blot on the British Army. I still get tearful. I always will get tearful. I just. .. it’s so hard, when you do hear the failings. His sonjames Dunsby, and fellow reservist Edward Maher and Craig Roberts were described as marvellous fit men with a do or die attitude, taken down at the height of their ambitious. The weather on the Beacons can change in an instant. Two years ago it was the hottest day of the year. The coroner listed the failings, not enough water, proper risk assessment or rescue plan in place. When men went down with heat illness there was a chaotic response. By the time the emergency services arrived, it was too late. Reaching a conclusion of neglect, the coroner said there had been a series of very serious mistakes and systematic failings. The Army had failed to properly manage and organise the march. If it had fold the Ministry of Defence’s own guidance the march should have been stopped and all three soldiers would have survived. Like the others, james Dunsby, who served in Afghanistan, alongside Prince Harry, was wearing a GPS tracker. But they didn’t notice he’d stopped for more than an hour, just one of the failings his wife heard in court. There have been times during the course of this inquest when the Ministry of Defence has lost sight of the importance of their very own values and standards. They displayed no responsibility, no accountability and no humility for their role in creating the culture which led to the events of the 13th july 2013. We are truly sorry for all the mistakes that the coroner identified today. We have already made a number of changes to the exercise, in terms of the way it is run. james Dunsby return to the Beacons to complete the march his son never finished. His hope is that this will never happen again. jonathan Beale, BBC News. Nasa’s New Horizons spacecraft has made the first visit to Pluto after a nine-yearjourney to reach the planet, which lies around three billion miles from Earth. The space agency has released the most detailed image yet of Pluto and, over the next 2lI-hours, it’s expected to provide valuable information about a remote area of space. Our science editor, David Shukman, reports from mission headquarters in Maryland. Nine, eight, seven, six... Counting down to the first encounter with the distant world of Pluto. CHEERING The moment that years of planning and waiting have at last paid off. The atmosphere is incredible. There’s a great sense of achievement at getting the spacecraft the three billion miles to Pluto, but also just sheer excitement at witnessing and sharing a moment of discovery. It was nearly a decade ago that the New Horizons spacecraft set off and blurred views of Pluto soon became sharper and sharper, sights that have just not been possible before. And today we received this image, revealing some bizarre patterns. This is a world that’s icy, but also active. It’s snowing frozen nitrogen, and scientists were thrilled when the picture came in. APPLAUSE Theyjust can’t believe they got this far. There are rare times when you get to do something that’s larger than life, and the exploration of the farthest world that humans have ever explored, the completion of the initial reconnaissance of the solar system, that sounds like science fiction, but it’s not. Today, we flew by Pluto. And tomorrow, the presents start landing. Images and spectra and data that’ll write the textbook. Pluto was only a speck of light when it was spotted back in 1930, the work of a young astronomer called Clyde Tombaugh. He’s since died, but some of his ashes have been carried on the spacecraft as it shoots past Pluto. And today his son was here at Mission Control and told me of his pride. A little piece of dad is going to the planet that he discovered and then on into the universe forever. How does that feel to you and your family? Absolutely fantastic. It’s a thrill. The fly- past happened with astonishing accuracy, the spacecraft aiming for a particular point in space for the best possible view. Until now, we’ve only had artists’ impressions of Pluto. Now there are real pictures.This one has had the colours enhanced to highlight features that are so unexpected that no-one can yet explain them, and there’s much more to come tomorrow. People here are waiting for a signal confirmed the fly-past was successful. The spacecraft is beyond Pluto it. Takes four-and-a-half hours for radio messages to reach earth. Assuming everything has gone OK. People are confident. We should start to get the first close-up pictures of Pluto during tomorrow. David, thank you very much.

The area would accommodate 230 vehicles, which haulage firms say is a fraction of the traffic at busy times. It’s thought there are 5,000 migrants now living around Calais hoping to cross to the UK, and the numbers are reported to be growing. Magdalena Luczak, the mother of murdered four-year-old Daniel Pelka, has died in prison. She was jailed for life two years ago, along with her partner.

A planned parliamentary vote on relaxing the rules on fox hunting in England and Wales has been postponed after the Scottish National Party warned it would vote against and try to block it. MPs had been due to debate the issue tomorrow. The Prime Minister has accused the SNP of opportunism. The change of plan has been welcomed by campaigners against hunting, as our political correspondent, Carole Walker, reports. No more torture. No more fear. We don’t want fox-hunting here. Opponents of hunting gathered outside parliament to voice their opposition to plans to relax the restrictions on hunting in England, but tomorrow’s free vote on the proposals was abandoned when the Scottish National Party reversed its previous position and said it would vote against them, leaving the Government facing defeat. The issue is on hold, at least until the rules are changed to give English MPs a greater say on English-only laws. Scotland’s First Minister was delighted to have forced the Prime Minister to climb down. He’s had to pull the English votes for English laws proposals as well as now having to pull the fox-hunting proposals. That underlines that David Cameron is not master of all he surveys in the House of Commons. He’s got a fragile majority. Hunting has long provoked strong views on both sides, but this has now become a constitutional row too over how our parliament works and who gets to vote on the laws of the land. The position of the SNP has, up to now, always been clear, which is that they do not vote on matters that are purely of interest to England or England and Wales, particularly if they’ve already settled that issue in Scotland. So I find their position today entirely opportunistic. Under the Government’s plans, Scottish MPs won’t get a say on every stage of legislation that only affects England, but they will get to vote before any law is passed. So they could still scupper any future moves to change the hunting rules in England. The Government wanted to bring them in line with those in Scotland to allow an unlimited number of hounds to flush out their prey, but this is not just about the fate of foxes north or south of the border, it’s a struggle for power in the new political landscape. Carole Walker, BBC News, Westminster. In Greece, the Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, is fighting to convince members of his own party to back the reforms being demanded in order to secure anther bail out. There’ll be a vote in the Greek parliament tomorrow. But Greece still needs a bridging loan until the bail out funds arrive. One option is a temporary loan from a fund to which the UK makes a contribution. Let’sjoin our Europe editor, Katya Adler, in Athens. Katya, your thoughts tonight on the challenge that Mr Tsipras is now facing? Well, Huw, Prime Minister Tsipras has had a few nail-biting moments in the last few moments as he stood defiant before his international creditors. Tension returns to Athens. He facing the wrath of his Owen party. As a trust-building exercise, countried Iors asked the Greek parliament to pass tough reforms toll tomorrow on VAT and pensions. Prime Minister Tsipras can rely on the opposition for support, Tsipras can rely on the opposition forsupport, but for support, but how many of his own MPs will vote against him? And how big will street protests be that are planned? That worries him. He took to state TV tonight to sell the deal hard. In the meantime, before this new bail out deal is finalised, this bankrupt country needs several billion euros in emergency loans in order to keep afloat. The European Commission has suggested using this fund that the UK contributes to, a tight-lipped George Osborne said the Eurozone should sort its own problems. It could be overruled, it would cause a political storm. We are not there yet, this isjust would cause a political storm. We are not there yet, this is just a proposal. Katya Adler there in Athens. In Sierra Leone, health officials are warning that new cases of Ebola are continuing to emerge over a year after the major outbreak was first declared. There had been a marked decline in cases in recent months, but in the capital Freetown there’s been a sudden rise in new infections, as our correspondent, Tulip Mazumdar, reports. There’s optimism in the air, as medics continue to put their lives on the line to treat sick patients. This is one of the few treatment centres still taking patients. They’re currently treating seven suspected Ebola patients, but none of them came to this centre of their own accord, health workers had to go into communities to find them. People who’ve been identified as high-risk, but refuse treatment, face a fine and evenjail. People still don’t believe there is Ebola. There’s quite a lot of resistance. The reason being fear and the people also say, I want to be with my family. Hunting down new cases is a laborious task. Little Sori is the youngest of A6 people now in quarantine here in this village. 35.8. They are checked for symptoms by UK-funded community investigators twice a day, whilst confined to their homes for three weeks. How are you and your family, sir? TRANSLATION: I haven’t been able to go to work on the farm. In the future, how am I going to feed my children? Day and night. You patrol? The military enforces the quarantine, and this is where they receive their orders from. We are winning the war, but it’s not over. As long as we have one case, we still have an epidemic. I know that a few months ago this was an emergency. People’s attentions might have moved on elsewhere, but let’s just remember that what we’re doing here is serving as the first line of defence. If we don’t beat it here, we’ll have to face it elsewhere. But the end is in sight, and here’s what it will look like. Kerry Town, the multi-million-pound British-built treatment centre has now closed. The former danger zone is eerily quiet. This is where hundreds of people were treated and it’s also where many died. At a smaller unit on the site, specifically for infected health workers, one patient is being cared for. But a major concern is what happens when international medics and money start leaving Sierra Leone. The country’s President says it needs help to look after a community still in shock and a health system on its knees. Tulip Mazumdar, BBC News, Freetown. Chris Froome has taken a convincing lead in the Tour de France after the latest stage of the competition. He produced a stunning ride to win Stage 10, increasing his overall lead to nearly three minutes. He’s the clear favourite to win the title again, despite allegations that critics have been raising unfair questions about his performance, as Matt Slater reports. On Bastille Day in France, it was Chris Froome’s relentless revolutions that have probably locked up the yellowjersey for a second time. As the Tour reached the Pyrenees, Froome’s team-mates turned the screw. Defending Champion, Vincenzo Nibail, was the first to falter, but it wasn’t long before the Kenyan-born Brit broke out on his own, leaving all his rivals behind. It was textbook from the team. The guys just rode such a good race there. So... just over the moon to have been able to finish it off for them. Well, it’s been Chris Froome’s performances in the mountains of the Tour that have really kick-started these conspiracy theories about Chris Froome’s performance, particularly on social media, and today’s dominant display is only going to fuel those who feel they’ve seen this show before, starring a certain Lance Armstrong. For Froome and his team, they’ve got a realjob to do to prove that this is a different story. The saga of suspicion about the 2013 Tour winner’s strength was given a new twist yesterday when Team Sky claimed his power data, measured in watts and gathered by a small device in his pedal cranks, had been hacked and posted online in an attempt to prove he is doping, but the man whose work exposed Armstrong’s cheating is not convinced. Maybe it was hacked. Maybe it was leaked. Who knows. But how relevant is it if what it shows is totally inconclusive? But there is nothing inconclusive about Froome’s command of this race and while we are not even halfway to Paris, he’s odds on to regain cycling’s biggest prize. Matt Slater, BBC News, in La Pierre-Saint-Martin. Here on BBC One it’s time for the news where you are. Have as very good night. Good evening. I’m Riz Lateef. More than 100 pupils in Tower Hamlets have disappeared from school registers without any indication of where they are. The discovery was made in an ongoing investigation into Islamist radicals targeting east London schools. Ofsted is calling on the Government to tighten the law on how children who leave school are monitored. Here’s our education reporter, Marc Ashdown. Fears of a Trojan horse plot may have proved unfounded but the concern some schools are failing to protect children from extremist influences go on. Ofsted has been monitoring seven schools in Tower Hamlets. Today it raised serious safeguarding concerns which could affect all schools in England. Writing to the Education Secretary, the Chief Inspector Of Schools said inspectors found: ""Potentially high numbers of pupils whose names are being deleted from school admissions registers without an accurate understanding of where they’ve gone."" Schools often only give ""generic reasons"" such as ""the child has gone to live with grandparents"", ""moved abroad"" or, in one case, ""gone back to Libya"". He goes on: ""We cannot be sure that some of these children are not being exposed to harm, exploitation or the influence of extremist ideologies."" So, how many children could be at risk? Ofsted says, last year in Tower Hamlets, 428 pupils were moved from schools during term time. Of those, in 109 cases, they are not certain about their whereabouts. Where could they have gone? This Tower Hamlets backstreet gives a clue. This used to be a private tuition centre where parents would send pupils after school for additional evening classes in Islamic studies. But this had become a fully fledged school which is illegal. It was raided by anti-terrorist police and shut down. -i-i’IâIââ BFE ITI8I’Iy ITIOFE. This parent thinks in many cases it could simply be a cultural breakdown. Maybe in the elder communities they don’t know how to communicate, It could be a lack of communication. They can explain to them. OK, you are going there, that is it. Of the seven schools inspected, one has been praised for making huge improvements. But concerns remain about six independent Islamic schools and what they are teaching their children. They were inspected last autumn and there is very little improvement. I think it is very worrying, not least of which, three of them are connected to hardline mosques within the borough. We need to investigate what is going on in the mosques and schools. Tower Hamlets Council said it accepts the concerns raised but quite rightly says it is an issue for all schools. The Education Secretary is taking these findings very seriously. We are told she will issue new guidance to schools by the end of the week. New laws requiring them to keep records of where pupils go when they leave are likely to follow. Marc Ashdown, BBC London News. Three men have been arrested on suspicion of being involved in the preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. One man in his 20s was arrested in Letchworth in Hertfordshire and a further two men in Luton. The Metropolitan Police says the arrests are part of an ongoing investigation into Islamist-related terrorism.

Mr Obama’s father came from Kenya and the president will become the first sitting US leader to visit the country when he lands there later today. Let’s talk now to our North America editor, jon Sopel, who spoke to the president in the White House in advance of his trip. Thanks very much. The president is going to arrive in Nairobi in the next few hours. A strange homecoming for him. His ancestral home. You can imagine what the reaction was among the Secret Service when the president says, I want to start my Africa trip in Kenya, given recent terror activity by Al-Shabab where they attacked the university, there was the Westgate moral incident and a whole heap of incidents on the Indian coast Peshmerga Westgate shopping mall incident. That was my first question, I wanted to know why. -- Westgate Shopping Centre. I think it is important, first of all, that the president of the United States underscores our commitment to partnering with countries around the world and that we are not intimidated by terrorist organisations. Second, the counterterrorism cooperation between the United States and Kenya and Uganda and other countries in East Africa is very strong and part of the subject of the visit is to continue to strengthen those ties, to make them more effective. The third, as I wind down my presidency, I have already had a number of visits to Africa, but this gives me an opportunity to focus on a region that I have not been visiting as president and I am also going to have the opportunity to talk to the African Union, so I will be the first US president to not only visit Kenya and Ethiopia, but also to address the continent as a whole, building off the African summit that we did here which was historic and has, I think, deepened the kinds of already strong relationships we have across the continent. He said he was going to be a candid friend to Africa. He said he would be blunt in telling people they had to do more about issues like corruption and abuse of human rights. He also linked the whole issue of security to the question of wealth and prosperity. The keynote of his visit to Nairobi will be to speak at an entrepreneurship summit. I asked him about that, whether there was a clear relationship between being an entrepreneur and dealing with terror. I believe that when people see opportunity, when they have a sense of control of their own destiny, then they are less vulnerable to the propaganda and twisted ideologies that have been attracting young people, particularly now being turbo-charged through social media. A while back, when we started looking at strategies to reach out to the Muslim world, to reach out to developed countries, a common theme emerged which was people are not interested in just being patrons or being patronised, being given aid, they are interested in building capacity. The more we can encourage entrepreneurship, particularly for young people, the more they have hope. That requires some reforms in these governments that we continue to emphasise, rooting out corruption, increased transparency in how government operates, making sure that regulations are not designed just to advantage elites but are allowing people who have a good idea to get out there and get things done. It was a wide-ranging interview that I did with the president and we talked about domestic concerns in the US. Iwanted talked about domestic concerns in the US. I wanted to know, where words are areas where he would perhaps admit he had fallen short of stock he was very candid on the issue of gun crime, saying it was his greatest frustration that he had not been able to do more. I suggested race had read its ugly head once again in his presidency. On this he said attitudes were changing. Children growing up during these eight years will have a different view of race relations in this country and what is possible. Black children, white children, Latino children. America is becoming more diverse. It is becoming more tolerant as a consequence. There are more interactions between groups. There are going to be tensions that arise, but if you look at my daughter’s generation, they have an attitude about race that is entirely different than even my generation. And that is all for the good. MrObama is now Mr Obama is now nearing the end of his presidency, did you get the impression this is effectively his last lap? He said, I am winding down mY last lap? He said, I am winding down my presidency, giving the impression like an old rock band going on its final world tour. I think it is the reverse. He had a terrible election result, the midterms last November, everyone said, his administration is over. He has been energised since then and got all sorts of things done. I think he is very ambitious for what can be achieved in the last 18 months, given the resumption of diplomatic relations with Cuba, the trade deal with Asia, the around nuclear deal that was fined after such painstaking negotiations, add to that a couple of Supreme Court rulings that went very much in his favour on gay marriage and health care reforms and he is saying, things have never been so good. When you talk to him, he has got a very different demeanour than a year ago. When I met him yesterday, he was relaxed, chatty, confident, engaging. You looked at him a year ago and he looked beleaguered, as though he was carrying around a sack of coal. I think he feels there is a lot more he can do and will do in the twilight of his presidency. Many thanks. The world is a step closer to having its first malaria vaccine approved for use with the European agency responsible for evaluating medicines clearing it for safety and effectiveness. Malaria kills around 584,000 people a year worldwide. An estimated 90% of all malaria deaths occur in Africa. Children aged under five account for 78% of all deaths and it is estimated that in Africa malaria kills one child every minute. The drug has taken decades of research by GlaxoSmithKline. But as our medical correspondent, Fergus Walsh, explains, it’s not in itself the complete answer. Malaria is one of the world’s’s greatest health threats, a parasitic infection carried by mosquitoes. Approval of the malaria vaccine by regulators is a milestone in public health. The drug giant GlaxoSmithKline began working on the vaccine in 1984. It has pledged it will not make a profit from sales. This is a hugely significant moment because this is the very first vaccine that has ever been developed against malaria, against a parasite, and it has shown very significant impact in the studies we have done to date. I have been working on this for 30 years and this is a dream come true. But, and it is a big but, the malaria vaccine does not work as well as scientists hoped. Trials and seven African countries show it reduces cases of severe malaria in young children are just a third. And then only if they receive four doses of the jab. Ensuring that happens will be a major logistical problem in countries with very limited health services. And it does not work well in young baby so it is not the solution to combating malaria. This is not a magic bullet, having the low efficacy vaccine available for the first time. But it is a very substantial scientific achievement and one that has been a long time coming because it has been a very difficult fields. How important it will be in real public health terms in controlling malaria remains to be seen. It will be now up to the World Health Organization to decide whether to recommend a vaccine’s use in Africa. Even a partially effective malarial vaccines would have a significant impact in African countries with the highest rates of the disease, preventing many more children from falling ill and being hospitalised. Muskie turned nets and insecticides will remain the main protection against malaria. -- mosquito nets. But more effective vaccines are likely to come on stream in the future. Fergus is here now. What happens next? The World Health Organization now has the evidence it needs to make a choice about whether to roll out the imperfect vaccine in African countries. I think what they will recommend later this year is that it should be used in countries of the highest malaria transmission, where children often get the disease four, five, six times in a year, and see how it works in the real world for five or six years. It is an imperfect vaccine but we should celebrate the scientific achievement, the parasite, once it enters the body, undergoes a very complex life cycle. Many thought it would be impossible to have even a partially effective vaccine. So that is promising. We must remember that malaria is a deadly disease and there is a real danger of the spread of drug-resistant strains of the parasite which will make current drugs ineffective. We need better vaccines and work on those is continuing. just briefly, who is going to pay for this drug when it is rolled out? That is the big question. GS Kay has said it will not make a profit. It will be a combination of Gates foundation, UK Government, other governments putting money in so that children can be protected in Africa -- GlaxoSmithKline. Drivers trying to reach the continent through the Channel Tunnel have been warned to expect more delays because of migrants trying to enter Britain illegally from France. Eurotunnel said hundreds of people had tried to break into the terminal overnight and that it was becoming a nightly occurrence. Here, Operation Stack is again in action, meaning the motorway on the British side of the Channel Tunnel is clogged with miles of parked lorries. The Freight Transport Association says the delays have cost the haulage industry more than £14 million in the past three months. Duncan Kennedy is in Ashford. This is what you might call organised chaos. I am on the roundabout above the M20 because the M20 is closed southbound for the following three junctions. This is the police trying to sort it out. They are sending lorries left back down onto the M20 to join the operation, Operation Stack, effectively, a car park for lorries. All of the cars, not least because all of the cars have children going on holiday today, they are being sent across country on a diversion and they will rejoin the motorway at junction 12. Something approaching chaos here. Lots of delays. All caused by the migrant crisis in Calais. It is having huge knock-on effects back here. This is what motorists are facing today and one of the busiest roads in Britain. It is the M20 in Kent, now closed the length of three entire junctions. These lorries are being held in what is called police Operation Stack, in other words, is called police Operation Stack, in otherwords, it is is called police Operation Stack, in other words, it is an elongated car park. As well as frantic parents trying to take children on holiday, huge delays are costing industry and the police a fortune. Operation Stack has cost taxpayers more than £700,000 over the last three weeks. At peak demand, there have been 112 Kent Police staff working on the operation every 24 hours. The county’s Police and Crime Commissioner has called on the Government to step in to pick up the full cost of the national operation. It has been going on for 20 years and until now, it has been looked on as a local difficulty when actually it isn’t, it is now a chronic national problem. It is not something that happens occasionally, it happens all the time. The police should be funded nationally. The bill should not be picked up by Kent taxpayers. It is notjust haulage firms suffering. Small businesses like Richard’s who is an entertainer is also in trouble. He should be out entertaining old people in their homes. He simply cannot get there because of the jams. It is affecting me very badly in the way it affects all businesses but small businesses like myself, it affects our pocket directly. We lose money. We leave early to try to get there. If we cannot get there, because we are self-employed, we lose money. The Government has got to do something quickly. Richard’s business problems are not isolated. Other services are also being damaged. It is an absolute nightmare. It is having an effect on the practice. Patients cancelling. I am you losing money, losing business. The longer it happens, the more impact, the more built up that will be. It is hideous. All of this is happening because of the migrant crisis in Calais interfering with the transport network. This footage published by the Sun today shows migrants hiding on Eurotunnel freight trains earlier this month. The dangers and the desperation is clear. The immigration issues of hundreds of miles away are having a direct impact on thousands of lives here. That impact not only on small businesses and police but also the freight industry, who tells us it is costing their members £750,000 a day because of these delays. They are asking the Government to step in. The police in the past our tell us that Operation Stack on the 20 will be in place at least until Sunday. Duncan, thank you very much. Turkish military aircraft have, for the first time, carried out air strikes in Syria against the group calling itself Islamic State, a day after extremists attacked a Turkish military outpost. It also detained nearly 300 people suspected of being IS and Kurdish militants. Yesterday, the Turkish authorities agreed to give the US use of an airbase to launch attacks against IS, a decision described by American military officials as a game-changer. jim Muir reports from Istanbul. The Turkish border with Syria has been getting steadily more tense. Now, a deadly exchange of fire between Turkish forces and militants of IS across the board has triggered the first Turkish air strikes against militant targets in northern Syria. But Turkish stressed that if jets did not penetrate Syrian airspace, so, it does not mean the country hasjoined the coalition airspace, so, it does not mean the country has joined the coalition air campaign. What it has done after months of tense negotiations is to allow the American and otherjets to use the big airbase in southern Turkey to launch attacks against IS in Iraq and Syria. American officials describe this as a game changer that would allow the coalition jets to react changer that would allow the coalitionjets to react more quickly. Speaking after a phone call between President Obama and his Turkish counterpart, they are still call between President Obama and his Turkish counterpart, they are still coy about saying what it will mean in the fight against the militants. I do not have any in the fight against the militants. Ido not have any details for you on that. I can confirm that in the context of that conversation the two leaders did believe we would deepen our cooperation as we take on this Isil threat. Turkish police have also been cracking down at home. They have raided hundreds of houses throughout the country, detaining 250 suspects. Some are thought to be linked to IS militants but others are thought to belong to radical leftist groups and the Kurdish movement which announced it was responsible for killing two Turkish policeman in the south this week. The PKK had accused the Turkish authorities of colluding with IS to undermine the Kurdish cause. They partly blamed the Government for the suicide bomb attack on Monday which killed more than 3012 -- suicide bomb attack on Monday which killed more than 3012 -- 30 pro-Kurdish activists. That bomb attack has pitched Turkey into this new phase of crisis with its Kurdish minority and the Islamic militants. jimjoins me jim joins me now. Are we moving into a new phase in the war against IS? We are certainly moving to a new phase in Turkey’s and its own internal crisis, its own relationship with what is going on in Syria and all the battlefront it is fighting on, internal and external. As the president said just now, they regard both the PKK and IS as terrorists. They are now waging war left open warfare on them inside the country, raiding homes, arresting people, rounding up in mammals, preachers who had been advocating it and so on. They are starting to pull out the stops on IS and against its own Kurds. There is a deep rift in Turkish society. It looked as though there might be a solution coming along but that has dissipated. The Government is now in a minority. They are trying to form a coalition. There is a big political crisis going on. Turkey is moving into a new and more dangerous phase of crisis on many fronts.

Brollies at the ready. Sara Thornton has the outlook. Cheap drugs that are commonly used to strengthen bones could prevent deaths from breast cancer. New research published in the Lancet found the drugs, known as bisphosphonates, reduced deaths by 18% in women who were post-menopausal. It’s been described by a leading cancer charity as one of the most important findings in breast cancer for a decade. Our Health Correspondent, Sophie Hutchinson, reports. Every year, 34,000 women who have been through the menopause are diagnosed with breast cancer. Preventing its spreading, particularly to the bones, is extremely important. Adrian Morgan was given a bone strengthening drug when she was in the early stages of breast cancer. Ten years on she has had two tiny tumours in her bones and believes the reason there have not been more is because her bones have been protected. Ido not think I can overstate the importance of the bisphosphonates. It has allowed me to, despite having breast cancer, it has allowed me to live a reasonably normal life. It would be a real shame if all of the 45,000 women who are diagnosed every year with breast cancer are denied access to these drug -- with breast cancer are denied access to these drug-- drugs. with breast cancer are denied access to these drug -- drugs. Research reviewed data from 26 trials involving more than 18,000 women with breast cancer. It found that for postmenopausal women taking the drugs, deaths were reduced by 18% over ten years. Campaigners suggest 1,000 lives may be saved each year if the drugs were more widely prescribed. Those behind the steady set should not be hard for that to happen. Because the drugs are available, it could happen very quickly. Many of mY could happen very quickly. Many of my colleagues are keen to initiate the treatment, now the publication is out in the public domain. I think this is a dream and that should make a difference in a very short period of time. Bisphosphonates are not currently licensed for use in the spread against cancer. There is growing pressure for the health watchdog to review that and make them available for thousands of women. Taking action on climate change is vital to preserving the country’s economic prosperity - according to the Energy and Climate Change Secretary. In her first big speech on tackling global warming, Amber Rudd said ministers want to cut emissions while keeping the costs down. But Friends of the Earth say recent government policy will mean higher emissions and they’ve accused her of ""grotesque hypocrisy"". Our Environment Analyst, Roger Harrabin, is here. Is the criticism from Friends of the Earth fair? They are very strong words. Amber redwood in fish is not a hypocrite. She is genuinely concerned about climate change. -- She is genuinely concerned about climate change. -- Amber Road would insist she is not a hypocrite. She says we have is to take on policies now in a more conservative way, she means with less subsidy. What has been happening in the background, her department has been absolutely hammered by a series of changes from the Treasury, some of which have made it onto the screen and some of which have not. We have heard about cuts in wind subsidy. Also there has been the cut from clean cars, cuts to policies making clean homes, massive cuts on energy efficiency. There has been a relaxation of attacks on pollution and a new tax on energy produced from clean sources. The department has taken ten years to build up these policies and is now wondering what to do. The question is, where does the Government go from here? How does it make cuts it insists unnecessary in terms of carbon emissions? Two of the biggest bookmakers in the UK are merging, creating the largest chain of betting shops in the country. Ladbrokes and Gala Coral said their businesses would complement each other. Amazon shares have surged more than 18% in after-hours trading Amazon shares have surged more than 18% in after- hours trading after it reported a surprise profit and better than expected sales figures. The online retail giant reported a 92 million profit, compared with a $126 million loss for the same period a year ago. Sales rose 20% over $20 billion in the second quarter to the end ofjune boosted by strong growth in the US. Shoppers in the UK used 8.5 billion plastic bags last year, according to the anti-waste organisation, WRAP. It’s an increase of 2% on the year before but a lot less than when reporting began in 2006. In October, big shops in England will start charging five pence for a plastic bag. Retailers in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland already charge for them. Our Business Correspondent, joe Lynam, reports. For most of us, shopping is a stressful business. Sometimes it is easier to simply grab a plastic bag at the till. Despite all the warnings, the number of bags we’re using has risen for the fifth year in a row. Britain used 8.5 billion plastic bags. The average time we use a bag is only 20 minutes. From the till, to the car, to the kitchen, to the bin. They can take up to 1,000 years to decompose. That means many of them end up here, on landfill sites up and down the country. Some end up spoiling the countryside. Changes are on the way. Wales was the first part of the UK to introduce a charge for each plastic bag in 2010. Since then, there has been a 78% fall in the numbers of bags being used. Northern Ireland introduced its levies in 2013 and, that year, 71% fewer bags were used. Scotland has had bag charges only a year. 147 million fewer bags were used last year. England is the only nation without a bag levy and it accounts for the lion’s share of bag consumption. With an extra 240 million being used last year, it will start charging from October. That levy will only apply to large retailers with a staff of more than 250. Smaller shops can continue to hand out bags for free. The slight increase we have seen, 2% over the last year, is probably down to changing shopping habits. We’re not really doing that one big weekly shop any more and that is having an impact. Shoppers are urged to make a start already by bringing their own, reusable bags with them from now on. joe Lynam, BBC News.

VOICEOVERZ VOICEOVER: Barack Obama left foot Kenya last night, the first visit to his ancestral home since becoming president. The first visit of any American president to the East African country. Probably not the first pick of the US Secret Service, given the recent history of Al-Shabaab attacks on the Westgate Maule, in Nairobi, and on the University. Why was he so insistent on going to Kenya? A question I put to the President. It is important, first of all, that the president of the United States underscores our commitment to partnering with countries around the world, that we are not intimidated by terrorist organisations. -- are not intimidated by terrorist organisations. -- Westgate Mall. Second, the counterterrorist Second, the cou nterterrorist cooperation Second, the counterterrorist cooperation between Kenya, the United States, Uganda, other countries in Africa is very strong, and part of the subject of the visit is to continue to strengthen those ties to make them more effective. Not surprisingly, security has been massively stepped up at Nairobi airport, security is going to be a central theme of this visit. Barack Obama wants to fight the terror threat, notjust by force, but by encouraging wealth creation, he says there is a clear link between the two. I believe that when people see opportunity, when they have a sense of control of their own destiny, they are less former double to the propaganda and twisted ideologies. -- less vulnerable.

Turkish military aircraft have carried out air strikes against IS targets in neighbouring Syria and carried out a wave of arrests of IS sympathisers at home. It’s pledged to continue what it’s calling decisive action against the extremists. American military officials are calling the decision a ""game-changer"", as our diplomatic correspondent Bridget Kendall explains.

It follows a suicide bombing on Monday which shocked the nation, exposing in a town near the Syrian border killed 32 people, IS militants were blamed. On Thursday, a Turkish policeman was killed in cross border clashes. The threat, it seems, had become too serious to ignore. Until recently, the president of Turkey was reluctant to confront IS militants in Syria directly, claiming the real enemy was Bashar al-Assad and Turkey was too vulnerable to take action. 1.8 million refugees from Syria crowded in camps nearthe million refugees from Syria crowded in camps near the border, they have been there for years. And then, the long exposed board itself, which Turkey has been unwilling or unable to police. The President claims that Turkey also faces a threat from Kurdish separatists, allied to the Kurds inside Syria, who Turkey had no interest in helping. That is why when IS fighters attacked Kurdish in the Syrian town of Kobani, Turkish tanks did not intervene. From across the board, they watched the town go UP the board, they watched the town go up in smoke. Today, another significant shift, a green light to let American planes use the air base in southern Turkey, munching air strikes on IS.

The Old Bailey heard the abuse went on for years on a ""massive scale"". Eleven defendants faced trial, accused of A7 sexual offences. Our correspondent Sarah Campbell has more. VOICEOVER: These men all found guilty today played a part in the abuse of two schoolgirls in a case described as horrifying and depressing. Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, a place, said the prosecution, with a child sex ring on a massive scale. At the centre, two white schoolgirls, 12 or 13, over the course of six years, one of the girls was passed around 60 different men, nearly all of them of Asian heritage. One of the girls, known in court as Girl B, told the BBC that they were given alcohol and drugs and pressured into having sex. Her identity has been protected. I was laying on the bed, he came onto an, I was not going to say no, because I have always had it in my mind that if I say no, they will do what they want anyway. I thought I had to say yes. The court heard how Girl A was 12 when she was approached by one of the men in a toy store, both girls were taken to houses in Aylesbury for sex and passed around the men. Because of their immense courage, six men have been found guilty of numerous serious sexual offences against children. They will be no longer able to commit further offences against children in the future. The girl ‘s ordeal came to an end last year, with this Thames Valley Police arrest operation after one of the girls spoke out to say she had been abused by dozens of Asian men, although some civic leaders say that this is notjust a problem for Britain’s Asian community. Last year, Buckinghamshire County Council was criticised in an Ofsted report which said that children were being put at risk by widespread and serious failings. The council has now promised a serious case review following the latest court case. We will be reviewing all of the activity that went on during that period, and we will then be making findings and recommendations to any changes and policy and practice that we need to do. Aylesbury has become yet another British town where a vulnerable underage girls were sexually exploited over a prolonged period before anything was done to save them. A British soldier has died in hospital from wounds sustained in Afghanistan in 2012. Lance Corporal Michael Campbell from north Wales was shot while on patrol. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said the Army Reservist was ""proud and professional"" and a ""dedicated family man"" who had also served in Iraq. Police in Austria say two British men have been killed while taking part in a rally through the Alps. The men, who were aged 22 and 25, were on a mountain road near Innsbruck when they lost control of their car which broke through a guard rail and tumbled nearly a thousand feet. Road hauliers, the police and local politicians have held an emergency meeting in Kent as queues several miles long have built up on the approach to the channel tunnel in both France and the UK thanks to the migrant crisis in Calais and strike action by French ferry workers. The M20 southbound in Kent has effectively become a 35 mile long car park for lorries unable to get through the channel tunnel. Duncan Kennedy has the details. VOICEOVER: The 20 in Kent, there is no end in sight for the lorries or for the crisis causing it. -- no end in sight for the lorries or for the crisis causing it. -- M20. This is the 19th day this summer that the motorway has been closed to full traffic, that the motorway has been closed to fulltraffic, instead, full traffic, instead, trucks are stacked up as they wait to reach the Channel crossings. Paul Stevens is one who has waited hours here, he says that everyone’s business is suffering. Nothing you can do about it, you just have to put up with it. Look at the problem at ground level, we have speeded up this eight mile section of the motorway, to show you how longer queues go on. Freight industry says that all of this has cost them £14 million in the past three months. There is a big issue for the vehicles caught in stack, and a knock-on cost is huge, £750,000 every day. We have just pulled off the 20, within a few hundred metres, we have hit the trafficjam. -- hundred metres, we have hit the trafficjam. -- M20. It looks as though this goes on for miles and miles, three junctions, though this goes on for miles and miles, threejunctions, disrupting miles, three junctions, disrupting life miles, threejunctions, disrupting life right across this part of south-east England. The diverted traffic is wrecking small businesses as well, surrounding villages. Take this hairdresser is, today, full, only of empty chairs. Clients cannot get here, they are not willing to sit in traffic. We were totally booked this morning but we have had four cancellations. It is major. It is time they did something about it. A combination of striking French workers and migrants like these on a recent Eurotunnel train are behind the constant delays in Britain. This may be desperate for those trying to reach the UK, but transport operators say that it needs government leadership to stop it. This is something we do not have the resources as a company to stop. This is a European wide problem. The French have to get on top of the law and order locally, European governments have got to sort this out together. You would now have to build in plenty of time to get through, oraround, this vital build in plenty of time to get through, or around, this vital route to the coast. Police say the stacking operation will last at least until Sunday, the reasons causing it will prevail for much longer. Our top story this evening: Barack Obama today begins a four day visit to Kenya, the first for a US President. He has just landed. And still to come: how many of these do you have at home? Later on BBC London: Chaos and cancellations. It’s a wet and windy start, as the great British summer holiday SEBSOFI gets UI’IdâIâW8y. And, the new man in charge at the FA tells us he wants clubs to do more to recruit black managers. doing all that it can to rid the Pittodrie of its seagulls. The world’s first malaria vaccine has come a big step closer, it’s been approved by the European Medicines Agency. Each year there are 198 million malaria cases worldwide and it kills around 584,000 people. 90% of all deaths have been in Africa. The vaccine has taken decades of research by the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline. But as our Medical Correspondent Fergus Walsh explains, the vaccine doesn’t work for everyone. Malaria causes untold misery, especially in Africa. So regulatory approval of the first vaccine is a milestone in public health. The laboratory research involved took decades, human trials started 17 years ago. The manufacturer, GlaxoSmithKline, has pledged not to make a profit from sales. This is a hugely significant moment because this is the very first vaccine that has ever been developed against malaria. Against a parasite. It has shown very significant impact in the studies that we have done. I have been working on this for 30 years and it is a dream come true. Malaria is a huge public health threat which kills one child in Africa every minute. It is transmitted when a mosquito feeds on a human and injects the parasites into the bloodstream. The first vaccine offers some protection but only reduces cases of severe malaria by a third in young children. And then only if they are given four doses. It does not offer significant protection to babies. That raises the key question: is it effective enough to be worth using in Africa? The World Health Organisation will make that difficult decision later this year. What is clear is that mosquito nets and insecticides will remain the main protection against malaria. A bed net is more effective than this vaccine. So this is not a magic bullet, having this low efficacy vaccine available for the first time, but it is a very substantial scientific achievement. One that has been a long time coming, because this has been a very difficult field. How important it will be in real public health terms in controlling malaria remains to be seen. For these children, who were part of the clinical trials, the malaria vaccine was shown to prevent some sickness. Other malaria jabs are in development and it is hoped that they will eventually offer greater protection to children. Scientists have developed what they’re describing as a bomb-proof material that could be a major step forward in aircraft security. They say it can contain a blast in the luggage hold. Tests on the new technology have been carried out this week An experiment to make planes safer, luggage is loaded at an airfield in Gloucestershire. Somewhere in here there is a bomb. Minutes later it is set off. This high-speed camera captures the moment of destruction, the aircraft does not stand a chance. Now a new technology is being put to the test, it’s called a fly bag. Designed to absorb explosions. This rucksack carries a bomb. It is detonated and the bag expands and bulges, there is an inferno inside here, and when the dust settles we see what’s happened. These are the charred remains of the luggage and I can still smell the explosives in the air but the bag is intact. It contained the blast. That means that the aircraft is not damaged and crucially any passengers who might have been on board would have survived a bomb going off right underneath them. This computer simulation shows how the material does itsjob, even though it’s only about a millimetre thick. We have the Kevlar-type material which is used in bullet-proof vests which gives it the resilience and strength. The bag is not rigid. It has got this flexibility which enables it to softly capture the effects of the fragments and the pressure that is generated from the explosion. The threat in mind is the bomb that exploded in the luggage of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie back in 1988. 270 people were killed. Since then airport security has improved massively. And five years ago explosives inside printer cartridges were found before they were loaded. We asked aviation expert Chris Yates about the new bag and whether it would catch on with the airlines. The airlines are already paying for every bit of security that is applied to a given flight and because of that this mayjust be the straw that breaks the camel’s back. Another test of the bag and again it works, new technology offering a final line of defence if airport security should fail. Borno non-protected plane, this is a reminder of the struggle against terrorism and the constant need to keep one step ahead. -- terrorism and the constant need to keep one step ahead.-- an an unprotected plane. The speaker of the House of Commons, john Bercow, has been accused of ""obscene waste of money"" after a Freedom of Information request resulted in the disclosure of his expenses details over the last three VEBFS. Among his expenses was a hundred and seventy pound bill for being chauffeur driven to a conference less than a mile from Parliament. A spokesman for Mr Bercow said he was ""always mindful of costs"". The man in charge of the Russia World Cup has insisted that the current FIFA president Sepp Blatter is ""a victim"". Russia 2018 Chief Executive Alexei Sorokin told the BBC that Blatter isn’t to blame for the corruption scandal engulfing football’s world governing body. Mr Blatter is in St Petersburg for tomorrow’s World Cup draw - where questions persist about Russia’s suitability to host the tournament. From there, here’s our Sports Editor Dan Roan. It may be the residence of the President but St Petersburg’s Constantine Palace is about to play host to the first big moment in the countdown to Russia 2018. I’m happy to be here. Sepp Blatter is in town for the World Cup draw, his first overseas trip since Fifa’s corruption scandal forced him to announce that he was stepping down. Today Fifa admitted that its handling of the crisis is putting off new and existing sponsors like Coca-Cola, but the man in charge of Russia’s World Cup told me that Sepp Blatter is not to blame. He is a victim of the overall situation, the overall atmosphere around Fifa. He is a very brave person to have taken up responsibility. For President Vladimir Putin, staging football’s flagship event is a personaltriumph, but allegations of corruption at Fifa have cast a cloud of suspicion. Russia is getting on with building new stadia like this one in St Petersburg. At the same time as criminal investigations in the US and Switzerland into the bidding for the next two World Cups. I don’t know for sure but I suspect that Russia have been awarded the right to host the Fifa World Cup because of bribes. Because corruption is a common thing here in the country. Up until now Qatar 2022 has been the symbol of Fifa’s recent troubles. Now, with preparations here at such an advanced stage, and on the eve of the draw, it is Russia that finds itself in the spotlight. Racism in football continues to be a problem. Only this week former Arsenal player Emmanuel Frimpong claimed he was abused during a match and some believe there should be a revote and a new World Cup host chosen. Outbursts of racism in football in Russia adds to the general view that it is not the right country. Organisers here deny any wrongdoing. Saying that they have no concerns about being stripped of the World Cup, despite continued suspicion. It is about casting shade on the most cherished Fifa product that is the World Cup, without any grounds. It is purely a blown up matter which hurts us. Final rehearsals ahead of the draw, each country’s qualifying journey to the next World Cup is about to be confirmed. Questions over their role as hosts seem to continue. The number of single-use plastic bags handed out by UK supermarkets has increased for the fifth year, running to 8 and a half billion. The number is up by 200 million on 2013 - despite the average household already having 40 plastic bags stashed away. There has been a fall in Scotland and Northern Ireland where customers are charged for bags - though in Wales where there’s also a charge, there’s been a slight rise this year. In October a charge comes into effect in England. Ed Thomas has the story. Every big shop needs a bag. For Sandy it means 15 plastic bags come into her house every week and not many go out. One, two, three, four, five, six,... And it goes on and on until it reaches... ..38, 39, 40. That is a lot of bags. How does it make you feel? I’m really surprised. Do you forget to reuse them? Well, I know for a fact that Ido forget to use them. 7.6 billion plastic bags were handed out in England by the big supermarkets last year. But look at what’s happened in the rest of the UK. Since 5p charges were brought in in Scotland, bag use was down by 18% last year. Across Northern Ireland it has fallen by 42%. Despite a slight increase in Wales in 2014, during the past five years it has dropped by 78%. England is playing catch-up and from October largest stores will start charging 5p for every one of these. Campaigners believe that it is needed to stop all of this. It’s incredibly important, we use 8.5 billion single use carrier bags every year. It is just totally unsustainable. Is this what shoppers want? It is dead easy to switch to using your own. It is cheaper. Is it a good thing? It is not good to be charged. The government believes it will work and mean fewer plastic bags leaving our supermarkets. Let’s take a look at the weather. How many plastic bags have you got? I have had a clear out recently and give my plastic bags to the delivery driver. The weather is causing headaches outside and we have particularly heavy rain around working its way across Wales and southern England too. Further north it is quieter and dryer to end the day. Heavy rain and gusty winds contributes to significant disruption to travel. Lots of people are travelling to start their summer getaway. Really heavy rain in the cause of the evening pushing across central and southern England towards East Anglia. Further north there will be late sunshine to end the day. Rumbles of thunder around and by the end of the night some places will have seen 50 millimetres of rain as a couple of inches, and winds of around 50 mph at times. Weather is causing disruption tonight in the south-east but elsewhere we will see clearing skies and temperatures taking a dip, a chilly start to the weekend across northern areas, particularly in the countryside. We still have rain and gusty winds in the east but it clears away quickly and there we have an improving day on Saturday. A few scattered heavy showers particularly in the north, further south there will be fewer. A little below average, the temperatures at this time of year. It looks as though we will end on a dry note but the next area of low pressure works in through the course of Sunday and eastern areas will start fine and dry note but the next area of low pressure works in through the course of Sunday and eastern areas will start finance Ryback turning wet and windy once again -- start finance Ryback turning wet and windy once again -- will start fine and dry but turn wet and windy.

That’s it from the Tonight on BBC London News: A new way to ease pressure on A&E, by keeping people who don’t really need it away. I was doing some silly things indoors. Not much, but now and again, putting the microwave on to cook a meal. Then going to get it out and there was nothing in the microwave. £206. Also tonight: Calls for more regulation on rickshaws, as a tourist is charged over £200 for a three-minute trip. The debate over new river crossings for east London. A boost to the economy, or environmental disaster? Plus, she’s the fastest British woman ever. We speak to Dina Asher-Smith before her debut at the Olympic Stadium. As a Londoner, it is going to be a phenomenal meeting, in the Olympic Stadium, in my home city. Good evening, I’m Asad Ahmad. A new way to ease the pressure on our overstretched accident and emergency services is being trialled in north-east London. The scheme works by making sure that only those who really need to go to casualty end up there. Others are instead given expert care at home. Is early signs already shown it is a success, 200 people a week are being treated without the need to go to a stunned and imagine the. Our political correspondent, Karl Mercer, has been to see if the idea is working. Accident and emergency is not always the best place to go. We have heard about the push by the NHS and the Government to keep people out of accident and emergency. Here, they see about 600 patients every day. What are you allergic to? Today was as busy as ever but things are changing. This hospital is part of a network with GPs, community health workers and the absence of service, trying to cheat people closer to home. We know money is limited and will become more limited. If we will all suffer. Local GPs are now based in accident and in the. It means patients can ring one numberand be pointed in the right direction for treatment. It is about medical professionals working better together. This is an evolving system. We need to try and cut through some of the strange meandering roads that exist. Fallen out of care in the care -- strange meandering roads that exist. Fallen out of care in the care -- at the bed in the care home. Ambulance crews and the community health team taking the strain away from AMD. Community treatment teams do a similarjob and there is a rehab service to take strain. Bosses here say 200 people a week are being kept out of. What a difference it has made, being dealt with by these people. Passing me around from department to department without GPs interfering. It has taught me how to manage my condition at home, and prevent the hospital visits, and me to start walking, do simple things. All the evidence says the moment you put someone in hospital, that outcome worsens. It is better to be in your home. That is common sense, with your family and neighbours around you. If we can do that, you are more likely to stay in your home after. The pilot will be extended, backed by extra Government money. Stay with us this Friday evening on BBC One. There’s lots to come tonight, including: School is out for summer, but the weather is not playing, as dozens of events across the capital are cancelled. Footage has emerged of a rickshaw driver charging a tourist over £200 for a three-minute journey from Oxford Circus to Marble Arch. It was all caught on camera by a taxi driver who then confronted the cyclist, before two policemen appear. Here’s our transport correspondent, Tom Edwards. £200. ",,

Barack Obama starts his trip to East Africa in Kenya - the first serving US President to visit the country. He arrives to offer support to the continent but also with a message. Rooting out corruption, increased transparency in how government operates. Making sure that regulations are not designed just to help elites but allowing people who have a good idea to get out there and get things done. We’ll be looking at what reception the President and his message are likely to receive. Turkey weighs into the fight against Islamic State for the first time with air strikes in neighbouring Syria. Six men from Buckinghamshire are convicted of repeatedly sexually abusing two schoolgirls over several years. And jessica Ennis-Hill back at the Olympic Stadium for the first time since the birth of her son beats her season’s best. It was incredible. I was thinking how it would feel being back in here, you can’t quite put it into words until you step into the stadium again. Tonight on BBC London: A new way to ease pressure on A&E - by keeping people who don’t really need it away. And will three new river crossings for east London boost the economy or just pollution levels? Good evening. President Obama has begun a four-day visit to Africa - a trip of both political and personal significance. The President’s father came from Kenya, In a moment, we’ll hear from our Africa correspondent, Alastair Leithead in Nairobi, on the reception the President is likely to get, but first, our North America editor, jon Sopel, has been speaking exclusively to Mr Obama, who told him the US needs to support countries such as Kenya and not be intimidated by terrorist organisations. Barack Obama arrived in Kenya this evening. The first visit to his ancestoral home since becoming President. Given recent history of al-Shabab attacks, it probably wasn’t the top choice of the US Secret Service. Why was he so insistent on going to Kenya? I think it is important, first of all, that the President of the United States underscores our commitment to partnering with countries around the world - that we’re not intimidated by terrorist organisations. Second, the cou nter-terrorism co-operation between the United States and Kenya and Uganda, and other countries in east Africa, is very strong. And you are going to talk about entrepreneurship at the summit in Nairobi. Is there any link between security and entrepreneurship? I think there is. I believe that when people see opportunity, when they have a sense of control of their own destiny, when they are less vulnerable to the propaganda and twisted ideologies, that have been attracting young people, particularly now being turbo-charged through social media, the more we can encourage entrepreneurship, particularly for young people, the more they have hope. Now, that requires some reforms by these Governments that we continue to emphasise. Ruling out corruption, increased transparency in how Government operates, making sure that regulations are not designed just to advantage the elites but allowing people, who have a good idea to get out there and get things done. If corruption is one of the tough messages that he’ll deliver, another is on abuse of human rights and the attitude of many African Governments towards homosexuality. I am not a fan of discrimination and bullying of anybody, on the basis of race, on the basis of religion, on the basis of sexual orientation and gender, and I think that this is part and parcel of the agenda that’s also going to be front and centre, and that is how we are treating women and girls. Our North America editor, jon Sopel, talking to President Obama about his visit. Well, tonight Mr Obama has been having dinner with his relatives in Kenya. Our Africa correspondent, Alastair Leithead, now on what lies ahead for the President’s visit. There is some flash photography in his report. Apparently, President Obama is in town and here at least, the gloss hasn’t come off the man Kenyans claim as their own. According to a poll, he is twice as popular here as he is at home. Amid great anticipation, they have been talking about little else. Barack encapsulates the Kenyan dream because out of the hardship, of growing up to where he is really is the Kenyan aspiration. There was an eerie silence on the normally crazily congested roads of rush-hour Nairobi. Security is as tight as you might expect for the first ever visit of an American president. It is just two years since al-Shabab attacked Westgate Mall in the heart of the capital. Countering the terror threat is high on America’s priority list. But making a basic living is most people’s biggest concern. Everyone is an entrepreneur here and they hope President Obama’s visit will bring more opportunities. Let’s talk about some of the companies that we have invested in. This woman hopes to shake his hand. The 23-year-old student started her own company teaching children how to invest in a virtual stock exchange, building her business future and theirs. The people who built America were entrepreneurs. The people who are building Africa right now are entrepreneurs. And we are just starting out, we are Silicon Valley when it was beginning so I’m excited. He should be too! On the streets there are some issues where President Obama and the people will not see eye to eye, despite his popularity. It’s not good boy to boy, man to man. But supporting gay rights is firmly on America’s agenda. This is being seen as a homecoming and, as the country of his father, Kenya means a great deal to Barack Obama. He will be meeting some of his family while he is here. But he has promised to pull no punches when it comes to talking to the president about some of the bigger challenges facing this country - corruption, good governance and human rights. A visitors’ book, signed by the stairs of Air Force One to mark an historic occasion but one where the security of the president and the region will dominate. But tonight it was time for family business, his first night on Kenyan soil spent at his hotel with his relatives all around him. After months of reluctance, Turkey has weighed in for the first time in the fight against so-called Islamic state. Turkish military aircraft are carrying out air strikes tonight against IS targets in neighbouring Syria and have made a series of arrests of IS sympathisers at home. It’s pledged to continue what it’s calling decisive action against the extremists. American military officials are calling the decision a ‘game-changer,' as our diplomatic correspondent, Bridget Kendall, explains. Turkish warplanes in action, and now it is official, they are joining the international air campaign against IS. Cockpit pictures of the first Turkish strikes this morning, targeting three so-called Islamic State positions in Syria. Turkey claims they were completely destroyed. And simultaneously, early morning police raids across Turkey, leading to nearly 300 arrests. Cracking down notjust on suspected IS extremists, but Kurdish separatists, too. The Turkish President claims they all represent a threat to the Turkish state. TRANSLATION: Our Government, our security forces will take Wi’1StâVâI’ TTIEGSUFES BFE I’1âCâSS3I’y. We are determined to stop forces from other countries interfering in our country. It all follows a suicide bombing on Monday which shocked the nation. The explosion in a town near the Syrian border killed 32 people and IS militants were blamed. The threat, it seems, had become too dangerous to ignore. Until recently, Turkey’s President Erdogan was reluctant to confront IS militants in Syria directly, claiming the real enemy was still President Assad, and anyway, Turkey was too vulnerable to take action. First, there were the refugees - 1.8 million of them from Syria, crowded in camps near the border. They’ve been there for years. Then the long, exposed border itself, which Turkey has been unwilling or unable to police. And President Erdogan claimed Turkey also faced a threat from its own Kurdish separatists, allied to the Kurds inside Syria, who Turkey had no interest in helping. That’s why when IS fighters attacked Kurds in the Syrian town of Kobani, Turkish tanks did not intervene. From across the border the Turks watched the town go up in smoke. And today another major shift - to let US warplanes use Turkish air bases to hit IS targets across the border. A signal that Turkey is no longer a reluctant partner, and that the battle to weaken IS militants is about to become more intense. Six men involved in a sex ring in Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire have been found guilty of abusing two young girls. The Old Bailey heard the abuse went on for years on a massive scale. Eleven defendants faced trial, accused of A7 sexual offences. Our correspondent, Sarah Campbell, has more. Their crimes have been described as horrific, all six played their part in abusing two schoolgirls. The charges included multiple rape and child prostitution. Their targets were two white girls aged 12 or 13. The girl known in court as B says they were given alcohol and drugs prior to sex. We have protected her identity. I was laying on the bed there with them and obviously he came on to me and I was sort of outnumbered in a sense. Of course I wasn’t going to say no because I always had it in my mind that if I say no, they are going to do what they want anyway. I was like, well, I have to say yes. This all took place in Aylesbury. The victim referred to in court as girl A said she was approached in the toy section of a department store. She was 12 and, over the course of six years, she was passed around 60 different men, nearly all of them of Asian heritage. It can be easier saying I love you after a couple of weeks and then you do whatever they want to please them. And then you just realise, you are in this cycle and trying to please everyone. And then, in the end, they drop you. Their ordeal came to an end last year with this Thames Valley Police operation. One of the girls spoke out, saying she had been abused by dozens of men. The county council was criticised by Ofsted for failings which were putting children at risk. Today, the council apologised to both girls for any missed opportunities. We do know a great deal more now about child sexual exploitation than we did back them. However, there were probably indications that may have been there but we, our staff, were not as aware at that point. Civic leaders have stressed that abuse isn’tjust a problem for Britain’s Asian community but Aylesbury does add its name to a list of towns and cities where child sexual exploitation has continued unchecked for years. Sarah Campbell, BBC News. Police in Austria say two British men have been killed while taking part in a rally through the Alps. The men, who were aged 22 and 25, were on a mountain road near Innsbruck when they lost control of their car, which broke through a guard rail and tumbled nearly a thousand feet. The Speaker of the House of Commons, john Bercow, has been accused of wasting an ""obscene"" account of money after a Freedom of Information request disclosed his expenses for the last three years. Mr Bercow spent £96,000 on travel and accommodation between 2010 and 2013. Receipts show he claimed £367 for a carjourney Receipts show he claimed £367 for a car journey to the Receipts show he claimed £367 for a carjourney to the University of Bedfordshire, to give a lecture on making Parliament a credible institution. In April, 2013, he spent £172 on a chauffeur driven car to a conference to St james’s, less than a mile from Parliament. Mr Bercow insies he’s mindful of costs. Yes and it’s notjust the overall sums, it is the way he has racked up those bills. A chauffeur driven car to take him to an official banquet at Buckingham Palace, less than one mile from Westminster with the bill around £130, you could have got a taxi each way for about £15. Another chauffeur driven car from Halifax which cost nearly £1000. We have had a statement from his office saying he always tries to avoid using a car when he can and only does so when it is strictly necessary in order to fulfil official obligations. They point out that he is committed to getting out and about, explaining how Parliament works, engaging with the public. George Osborne’s deputy said in a tweet the night that all MPs should be setting a better example when it comes to public money and the taxpayers Alliance, a pressure group, has said this is an obscene waste of money, taxpayers ObSCâIâ1â waste of TT’IOI’1ây, t8Xp3yâI’S TT’IOI’1ây. obscene waste of money, taxpayers money. john Bercow does not appear to have broken any rules but don’t forget that he was brought in largely to try to reform and restore the reputation of Parliament after the MPs expenses scandal and he has claimed that he has taken the lead in cleaning up politics.

A British soldier has died in hospital from wounds sustained in Afghanistan three years ago. Lance Corporal Michael Campbell from North Wales was shot while on patrol. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said the Army Reservist was ""proud and professional"" and a ""dedicated family man"".

One of the world’s leading carmakers is recalling 1.4 million cars in the United States after hackers revealed they could remotely take control of a vehicle’s onboard computer. Fiat-Chrysler, which makes Dodges and jeeps, has promised to provide updated software. Scientists have developed what they’re describing as a bomb-proof material that could be a major step forward in aircraft security. They say it can contain a blast in the luggage hold. Tests on the new technology have been carried out this week and our Science Editor David Shukman has been given exclusive access. An experiment to make planes safer. Luggage is loaded at an airfield in Gloucestershire. Somewhere in here there is a bomb. And minutes later, it is set off. This high-speed camera captures the moment of destruction, the aircraft doesn’t stand a chance. Now a new technology called a Fly-Bag is put to the test, designed to absorb the kind of explosion we have just seen. This rucksack carries the bomb. It is detonated and the bag expands and bulges, there is an inferno inside here and when the dust settles, we see what has happened. These are the charred remains of the luggage and I can still smell the explosives in the air but the bag is intact. It contained the blast which means the aircraft isn’t damaged and, crucially, it means that any passengers who might have been on board would have survived a bomb going off right underneath them. This computer simulation shows how the material does itsjob, even though it is only about a millimetre thick. So we have the Kevlar-type material which is used in bullet-proof vests which gives it the resilience and strength. And then, crucially, the bag is not rigid, it has this flexibility which enables it to softly capture the effects of both fragments and the pressure that is generated from an internal explosion. The threat in mind is the bomb in the luggage of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie in 1988. 270 people were killed. Since then, airport security has improved massively and five years ago, explosives inside printer cartridges were found before they were loaded. Forairlines, security on the ground is the most important line of defence and they have to pay for it so the question is whether they will stand the cost of extra safety measures in the air as well. Another test, and again, the bag contains the blast. A final safety barrier if the airport security should fail. But on an unprotected plane, this is a reminder of the struggle against terrorism, and the constant need to keep one step ahead. It’s been three years since the the London Olympics and tonight some of the stars who lit up London 2012 returned for the first day of action at the Sainsbury’s Anniversary Games. Usain Bolt, jessica Ennis-Hill and Mo Farah all competed this evening on the famous track in front of a packed house. Our Sports Correspondent Katie Gornall is there. It’s been a terrific night on the track. That’s right, fans have celebrated a night of nostalgia here and that will come as a relief after what has been a difficult year for the sport. They have been facing some high-profile allegations of doping and it has damaged athletics reputation but the night was a chance for the sport to take centre stage for all the right reasons. It was almost like turning back the clock, the fans screaming into the park and once more, London felt like an Olympic city. This time all that stayed away with the sunshine. High temperatures replaced by teaming rain, I rather damp stage for Britain’s returning stars. One has been married and had a baby since winning heptathlon gold. jessica Ennis-Hill was hoping to recapture the sort of speed that made her a champion. Cleanly away and a good start... And with the World Championshipsjust a month start... And with the World Championships just a month away, she showed her a competitive edge remains. I’m absolutely made up, such an adrenaline rush to be back here. The crowd was incredible and to run 79, I’m so happy, and finally finding my form at the right time in the season.

And the campaign to encourage older Londoners to take up a free vaccine against shingles. Good afternoon, and welcome to the BBC News at One. Lord Sewel is resisting calls for him to resign from the House of Lords after he was filmed allegedly taking cocaine with prostitutes. He is yet to comment on the claims, and has already quit as Lords deputy speaker and chairman of the Lords privileges and conduct committee. He could also face a police inquiry. David Cameron said he faced ‘very serious allegations’, but sources in the House of Lords have told the BBC Lord Sewel has indicated he does not intend to quit as a peer. Our political correspondent Carole Walker reports. The latest pictures in The Sun of Lord Sewel, who is already facing police and Parliamentary investigations after the paper released a video yesterday that appeared to show him snorting white powder in the company of prostitutes. In the latest video he makes unflattering comments about politicians of all parties. There was this about David Cameron. He said the former Prime Minister Tony Blair, who gave him his seat in the Lords, went seriously wrong towards the end. And he was scathing about the Mayor of London, Borisjohnson. Lord Sewel has not yet made any comment on the allegations against him. He has been suspended from the Labour Party, resigned as Lords Deputy Speaker and as chairman of the committee that oversees discipline in the upper house. There have been calls for him to stand down from Parliament. The Prime Minister, who is injakarta, had this reaction. These are very serious allegations. I think it’s right he stood down from his committee posts, and I’m sure further questions will be asked about whether it is appropriate to have someone legislating and acting in the House of Lords if they have genuinely behaved in this way. A senior Labour peer had this advice. I can onlyjudge it in the sense that if this happened to me I would be asking myself whether I wanted to stay and the answer would be no, not if it is all true. If I felt I had a defence, and this is important, I would voluntarily suspend myself from the house and ask the committee to look into it as quickly as possible and for the house to make a decision. I think these things need to be dealt with speedily but withjustice. It is understood Lord Sewel does not intend to resign from the Lords. Under new rules he could be the first peer to be expelled, but that would depend on the outcome of investigations by the police and the Commissioner for Standards in the Lords. Those could take many months. All this as the Prime Minister is due to appoint more members of the already crowded upper house. Lords reform has been put on the back burner. The latest scandal will only add further damage to the battered reputation of Parliament. Our assistant political editor Norman Smith is in Westminster. Will he go? Despite the embarrassing revelations, the damaging headlines, I think he may well not go, at least not any time soon. Why? Well, because for the House of Lords to launch an enquiry they would have to wait until a police investigation had been concluded. Even then the House of Lords is in recess at the moment. When an enquiry is eventually undertaken, they can last for months and months and months. But there are other reasons why something might not happen, that is because the House of Lords is a very collegiate place. And I suspect they might be wary indeed of kicking him out, because that would be the first time ever appear had been kicked out. I think they would be cautious about that -- out. I think they would be cautious about that -- eight peer had been kicked out. It is not entirely clear he has broken any rules of the House of Lords. There is no offence in bringing the house into disrepute. Peers who have been disciplined in the past have been disciplined for fiddling allowances, abusing expenses. Whatever you may think of what Lord Sewel has done, it’s not entirely clear that he’s done anything which directly impacts on the House of Lords. So if he is determined to stay put and to carry on as a peer, there may be little anybody can do about it. Thank you very much. Police searching for a missing seven-year-old boy have found the body of a child on a construction site. Conley Thompson was last seen playing with his friends at a park in Barnsley yesterday evening, his parents raised the alarm when he did not return home. Our correspondent Danny Savage is in Barnsley. Literally in the last few minutes the police cordoned here on the outskirts of Barnsley has been lifted, police tape has been taken down. The emergency services seem to be getting ready to leave. The alarm was raised late yesterday evening when this little seven-year-old, Conley Thompson, failed to return home. His parents called the police. Overnight dozens of officers were involved in the search. It ended abruptly at about 8:30am when a child’s body was found on this building site behind me here. It was shortly after 8:30am that police sealed off this lane on the outskirts of Barnsley. Over a dozen firefighters and specialist police officers were soon on the scene. They later confirmed the body of a child had been found. Police say they believe the body is that of seven-year-old comic Thomson who disappeared locally last night. He was found on a building site -- seven-year-old Conley Thompson. It is devastating, it is shocking. Things like that, you don’t expect them happening in your own area. It is upsetting. The mother is lovely, she’s a nice person. What about Conley? He was boisterous, so boisterous, but a lovely little boy. Seven-year-old Conley had been playing in this park, he was due home at 8pm and police were called when he failed to return. It had been raining heavily in the area for much of the day yesterday. Detectives say they are treating the child’s death as unexplained. That means that further investigations will have to take place by the police. A postmortem examination will now happen to establish just how and why he died, and there are effectively two scenarios. This was a terrible accident, he was on his way home, he strayed onto the building site and something happened to him, or there could be a more sinister explanation. And that will not emerge until this postmortem examination and further enquiries take place. But for now the emergency services are still here, still investigating why this little seven-year-old died. Thank you. One of the two main suspects in the murder of former Russian agent Alexander Litvinenko has told the BBC he can’t give evidence at the inquiry into his death. Dmitry Kovtun had been due to speak via video link from Moscow today but says he’s been unable to get permission to do so from Russian authorities. He has until 9am tomorrow to appear. Gordon Corera is at the Royal Courts ofjustice. Dmitry Kovtun was supposed to begin giving evidence by video link. If he appeared in person he would be arrested for suspicion of the murder of Alexander Litvinenko. This morning, the video screens were blank. He did not appear. There had been an exchange of letters and e-mails between him and the enquiry in the past few weeks in which he’d raised concerns that appearing might breach confidentiality agreements with Russian investigations. Dmitry Kovtun this morning told the BBC that in principle he was willing to appear before the enquiry. I have to say this morning there was great scepticism inside the enquiry about that possibility. Sir Robert Owen, thejudge who is that possibility. Sir Robert Owen, the judge who is sitting as chair of the enquiry said Mr Kovtun’s actions gave rise to the gravest suspicion that an attempt was being made to manipulate proceedings. For instance by claiming that Mr Kovtun had wanted to turn up but had been stopped from doing so by other parties. So Sir Robert Owen set a tight deadline of 9am tomorrow for Mr Kovtun to appear and start giving evidence, or else that opportunity, he said, would be lost. David Cameron has arrived in Indonesia on the first day of a four day trade mission in south-east Asia, accompanied by 31 business leaders. He’ll also visit Singapore, Vietnam and Malaysia, and is expected to sign trade deals worth more than £750 million. Our political correspondent Ben Wright is travelling with the Prime Minister and sent this report from jakarta. David Cameron arrived injakarta a short time ago and this will be his first visit. To the Indonesian President’s Palace. Indonesia is the first of four whistle-stop visits around south-east Asia over the next few days. Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam. The purpose of this trip is primarily about trade. David Cameron came with a planeload of business people and the hope is that they will find new markets, British goods, in this booming part of south-east Asia. But also they’ll be able to tap new sources of investment for the UK. Another issue that is sure to crop up during conversations is the issue of counterextremism, counterterrorism, and the issue of foreign fighters going from countries, including Indonesia, which does have the largest Muslim population in the world, people going from here to fight in Iraq and Syria. The two leaders, when they meet here, will want to discuss ways to boost counterterrorism measures, but also draw on each other’s experience for dealing with extremism in the first place. On the plane here, the Prime Minister told us reporters that he was also very concerned about Libya at the moment. The country does not have a government. There is a concern that it’s becoming somewhere that Isil are present, training fighters to go to Iraq and Syria. David Cameron said if there was proof of any immediate threat to British people that could be stopped by taking military action in Libya, he would take it. Bobbi Kristina Brown, the daughter of the late Whitney Houston and the singer, Bobby Brown, has died, almost six months after being found unconscious in her bath. She was 22. Her mother was found dead in a bath three years ago, after overdosing on drugs. David Sillito reports. Bobbi Kristina Brown, the only daughter of Whitney Houston, Kristi to her family. daughter of Whitney Houston, Kristi to herfamily. Injanuary daughter of Whitney Houston, Kristi to her family. Injanuary she had been discovered facedown in a bath in her home in Atlanta. She never regained consciousness. Her death a bleak echo of the way her mother had been found three years before. It was no secret that she’d struggled to cope. She’d talked about it in an interview with Oprah Winfrey. If you have asked me months ago I would not have even been able to do it, I would have said no. I wouldn’t have got through it. But you are getting through it. Yeah, yeah, Iam. Bopara’s words today, peace at last. -- Oprah’s words.

President Obama is in Ethiopia on the second leg of his African tour. It’s the first visit to the country by a serving US president and he’ll be the first to address the 54-member African Union at its headquarters in Addis Ababa. He’ll also hold discussions on ways to end the civil war in South Sudan. This is the historic presidential palace in at this abattoir. It is where Emperor Haley Selassie once lived and history is being made once again. President Obama is the first sitting US president to visit Ethiopia. Talks are already under way in this room behind me and he was welcome today with full military honours and greeted by Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn. It is likely to be at times difficult talks. President Obama has got to tread a fine line between raising concerns about democratic rights in Ethiopia,, things like freedom of speech, but at the same time make sure he does not alienate the valuable security partner. Among the issues they are likely to talk about are the attack yesterday in Mogadishu in Somalia on a hotel, one of the worst seen in recent times, but also South Sudan, the world’s newest state, which has been in the grips of war in the past few months. We are expecting that President Obama will chaira We are expecting that President Obama will chair a second session with the leaders of Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia and also a minister from Sudan. It will be a delicate discussion. Some of those countries have got a particular stake backing either side in the conflict in South Sudan which has already claimed 50,000 lives since it began a year and a half ago. Because of those vested interests no one is expecting a breakthrough quite yet. China’s stock market took it’s biggest one-day fall in more than eight years, dropping 8.5%. The fall came after weak economic data raised concerns about the health of world’s second largest economy. Our economics correspondent Andrew Walker is here. Should we be worried? We should not panic about it, but we should be wary. It is one of the symptoms of a wider crisis in the Chinese economy, a slowdown from very rapid rate of growth in the previous three decades to more sustainable ones. That transition is generating a certain amount of disruption, the question is will China suffer what is called a hard landing? If it does, it is of concern. China is an important trading partner and it could have wider effects on the global economy which would affect the rest of us. But bear in mind we do not know for sure that China will have a hard landing and the authorities are working very hard to make sure it is a stable transition. Merlin Entertainments, the company that owns the Alton Towers theme park, has warned that last month’s accident on one of its rollercoasters will mean its annual profits will be about 9% lower than expected. The accident, which caused the temporary closure of the site injune, left five people seriously injured after a roller-coaster carriage collided with an empty one. Merlin said that the incident had an adverse effect on trading at the start of the important summer period and could hit profits by up to £47 million. The Chancellor, George Osborne, is in Paris for a second day of talks with French ministers about Britian’s attempts to renegotiate its relationship with the European Union. He said that the single market is one of the biggest advantages the UK sees in the European Union, and that Britain wanted an EU that supported businesses and job creation. The former Chancellor Kenneth Clarke has told a court that he had never heard of a man who accused him of sexual assault. He’s appearing as a witness in the case of Ben Fellows, who is charged with perverting the course ofjustice by making a false sex abuse claim. Our correspondent Simonjones is in central London. Mr Fellowes had claimed that more than 20 years ago he was groped by Kenneth Clarke, the then Chancellor, in the office of political lobbyist. He told the police about this three years ago, but the prosecution said the police rapidly concluded there was not any truth in these allegations. Today Kenneth Clarke said he first heard about the claims when his son saw them on the Internet and he said he and his son were upset. He said it was a bit like hearing Martians had landed, their reaction was what this? He said he felt he was being pursued because at the time he was a bit of a B list celebrity as Chancellor of the Exchequer and he told the court today he had never heard of bedfellows before these allegations and had never met him. He said he decided not to pursue him through the courts because this would have made a circus of the event and he was worried it would have got into the papers and the papers would be wildly excited about it. Mr Fellowes has been giving evidence in his defence and he insisted he did meet Mr Clarke and this did happen and he simply had not created this to create the impression he was a victim. He denies perverting the course ofjustice and the trial continues. Simonjones, thank you very much. Every year millions of pounds worth of tractors are stolen from British farms. Police say many are stolen to order and shipped abroad, ending up as far away as Syria and Afghanistan. With large arable farms, eastern England is a particular hotspot, accounting for more than a fifth of all such thefts in the UK last year. Our reporter Richard Daniel has been to investigate this growing problem. Machinery, off to Oman. Absolutely. At the port of Felixstowe specialist police officers are on the lookout for stolen tractors. Every year farm vehicles worth millions of pounds disappear without trace. Taken by criminal gangs, most end up abroad. It has been taken apart to fit into here. It is only a small, 20-foot container, but they have managed to get it in. The National Vehicle Crime Intelligence Service hasjust four officers based at UK ports. They are put in a container very quickly and shipped out of the country. They can be stolen and out of the country within 48 hours quite easily because they are that well organised. They book the containers in advance, ready to go. This stolen tractor was found on a lorry before it boarded a ferry, while these tractors worth £85,000 were found in Germany. The thieves target all types of machinery. Thefts typically peak during the harvest. We have made arrests where people have got contacts on their phone in five or six different countries as far away as Iraq, Afghanistan, Turkey, Eastern Europe. It is notjust one specific destination. They are organised, they know what they are doing and we need to try and keep one step ahead of them. Tractor manufacturers were slow to improve the security of machines. They are now catching up fast. This new machine is bristling with security features. The trouble is tractors aged four or five years or older are particularly vulnerable. Last year, the country’s biggest farm insurer paid out nearly £6 million because of tractor theft. That is down on previous years, but the true cost to agriculture is much higher. It is a big problem for our members, our policyholders. It is their livelihood. If they get a machine stolen, they have to replace it and in the interim period they have to hire one and we try and cover the costs as quickly as we can, but it is still an interruption to the business. At Felixstowe they recover £2 million worth of stolen plant and tractors every year. As for the true figure, well, that is anyone’s guess. Richard Daniel, BBC News. Hundreds of young, aspiring technology entrepreneurs are taking part in events across the UK today to build new apps and websites. A week long ""Festival of Code"" will give youngsters a chance to develop digital solutions to real-life problems. Our Technology correspondent Rory Cellanjones is in north London. Yes, this festival is all about getting young people who are already programming and getting to come up with new ideas right across the UK. Let’s meet a couple of them. You are 16 and you have been coding for a while, but a lot of people do not know what coding is, explain. It is giving computers instructions and from there you can make websites and apps. jess, what are you working on? We are creating a website that allows you to find celebrities and artists online and you can use accommodation and travel options to find out how and where you can see them. You have already got programming skills and you are going to use them to build an app, a website? Yes, we are building an app. What are your ambitions in the long term? I would like to be an engineerand long term? I would like to be an engineer and focus on computers. You set this up seven years ago. What were your ambitions when you started? I wanted to find all of the children who could programme in the UK and I want this to be a world wide thing to bring them all together and create a community. They are all here until the end of the week. What are they going to come up with? I have absolutely no idea, but I am sure we will love it. Why is it imported to Britain? We are lacking in these skills. Yes, we BFE, are, and it is important for the economy. We have got emptyjobs and we have got children with skills and we can put them to work now and it is important we find them this work. There is a great deal of excitement. You get the idea they have been coding alone in their bedrooms. Yes, it is a bit like Christmas, it feels like that for them. It can be lonely. We are seeing here apparently the Premier League of young coders and the idea is that some of these people will end up being the next text superstars for the UK economy. After rain stopped play yesterday England’s women won the toss and put Australia into bat in the third one-day international of the Women’s Ashes at Worcester. A short time ago, Australia were 210-4. With the series perfectly poised and not a drop of rain in sight today, why not a smile from the England women in Worcester? Australia were soon up against it. Georgia Elway ‘s celebrated wicket number one and she should have had a hand in number two. With a clear run a chance missed, you can guess what happened next. Lanning looked to make the most of her luck and did. England and the sky is a little more gloomy now. But this is Britain and it is never too chilly for an ice cream, but be careful, do not drop it. Too late. One hoped such bad catching would not spread to the outfield and it did not. Laura Marsh’s safe hands. Ice cream is now going where they should and England ate up and another wicket as well, leaving the series and this match perfectly poised. It is time for a look at the weather and Matt Taylor is here. ~ I promise you, it isjuly, but it does not feel like it at the moment. I have checked the temperatures and it isjust 11 degrees in Glasgow. It feels like summer has turned to ashes and the weather does not change much over the next few days. That is the prospect of something drier later in the week, but I am not promising any huge amount of warmth. This is the villain at the moment. This area of low pressure pushes eastwards and it leaves this across the central swathes of the UK and it will sit here for the next 24 hours. Not a bad day in Orkney and Shetland and sunshine continues into the evening. just 13 degrees. In central and southern Scotland outbreaks continue and in Dumfries and Galloway and it turns wetter in Northern Ireland through the rest of the day. In the North of England there will be some lively showers. A little bit of sunshine breaking through cloud Everett now and then. The sunniest place is the south-west of England, but it is the windiest place as well. It stays breezy overnight, largely dry and largely dry to the north of Scotland. That same zone continues with outbreaks of rain on and off. The good news is it will not get too cold tonight and the temperatures will stay in double figures for many. We have got another wet start in the same areas as today. There will be a better chance of warmth in southern areas. Some isolated passing showers, but generally dry and brighter day with a chance of seeing the sunshine. It is still a blustery day, but when the sun is out it is still strong July the sun is out it is still strong july sunshine. Overnight into Wednesday our low pressure pushes off into Scandinavia and this is the next sting in the tail.

A warning that the most vulnerable in society won’t be looked after if carers’ wages go up. Care providers say Government plans to introduce the new National Living Wage will make some care in the home unaffordable. There is certainly anxiety that providers will be going out of business, and those providers won’t be there to carry out delivering services to some of the most frail and vulnerable members of society. We’ll be assessing how great the risk is to those most in need. A senior peer accused of taking drugs with prostitutes is to take leave from the House of Lords. Police find what’s believed to be the body of 7-year-old Conley Thompson. He went missing last night near Barnsley in South Yorkshire. The daughter of singer Whitney Houston has died. Calls for tighter controls of laughing gas following the death of a teenager in Bexley. And hundreds of Londoners are identified as being at risk of radicalisation. just 19 seconds for the time when the bin lorry went out of control, killing six people in its path. And some are in Scotland, how to cope with autumn in july. Good evening and welcome to the six o’clock news. Government plans to introduce the so-called National Living Wage could lead to ""catastrophic failure"" for people who need care in their own homes, according to the leading care providers. In an open letter to the Chancellor, seen by the BBC, the UK Homecare Association is warning its members won’t be able to pay the extra costs associated with the wage rise, which was introduced in the Budget, unless the Government provides more funding. Our Social Affairs Correspondent Alison Holt has more. Hello? It’s another busy day for Heather Pugh. She is here to help 9li-year-old Betty Turner with her lunch and her medicine. Good, you feeling all right today? As a care worker, Heather provides people with help for daily tasks like washing and dressing. And for many like Betty, it’s vital support. I couldn’t live here if they weren’t here. I’d have to go into a home. Which I don’t want to do, because I love my little flat. And as I am at the moment, I’m very, very happy. Heather is paid more than the minimum wage of £6.50 an hour, but many care workers are not. So the new National Living Wage, which will increase pay for over 25s to £9 an hour by 2020, will make a significant difference. That couple of pounds an hour overall can make a big difference. In the long run. It would also draw more people into want to do caring. Once you get into it, you see what a fantasticjob it is. But now many of the companies that provide home care have written to the Chancellor saying they are seriously worried about where the extra money to pay that higher wage bill will come from. This meeting brought together firms from across the UK. Most of the care they provide is bought by cash-strapped councils. Unless that is properly funded, we are in for a catastrophic disaster. At the end of the day it’s all about the people that we serve. And we have a huge number of silent victims, people locked behind front doors, they can’t get out and interact with other people. You don’t have to spend long in that meeting to get a real sense ofjust how worried the people who provide care are about their ability to get the sums to add up. When they have the new National Living Wage, they want to keep standards high and at the same time they have a squeeze on funding. At the moment, the providers say local authorities pay an average of £13 66 and hour for home care. But they estimate that to cover the new increased wages, travel and training, the real cost will be £16 70 an hour. There is certainly anxiety that providers will be going out of business. And that those providers won’t be there to carry on delivering services to some of the most frail and vulnerable members of society. The government declined an interview but in a statement says that the National Living Wage will benefit hundreds of thousands of care workers who will see their pay increase, and that overall the costs of providing social care will be considered during the spending review later this year. Care providers are suggesting with the Government’s new National Living Wage we are heading for a crisis in home care. Is it that serious? ~ I think the first thing to say here is that in a way it’s not really about the National Living Wage. I don’t think you have anyone who will argue against that. It is about that fundamental problem of funding social care. We have an ageing social population at the same time as we are in a period of austerity and budgets are being squeezed. For many years, councils, local authorities and care providers would say, they would argue that they have been trying to scrape away at any extra costs, but now they are down to the bone. To them, yet it is a real crisis. The government says it wants to work with the care sector and it wants to understand where the problems are and try and work towards getting a system that operates efficiently for everyone. Because we are going to need social care to work well with the population, as the complexity of people’s needs increase. If we don’t get it working well, we see the problems with more people turning up in hospitals, which are also under pressure. So there is something to worry about here. And it is something the government says it will be addressing in the future. Alison, thank you. And there’s more on the cost of care on the BBC website. That’s bbc.co.uk/news. A peer who was caught by a newspaper allegedly taking drugs with prostitutes is resisting calls to resign from the House of Lords. Lord Sewel has quit the Labour Party and other roles as Deputy Speaker of the Lords and chair of its Privileges and Conduct Committee. He could now face a police inquiry. From Westminster, Vicki Young. He’s not the first parliamentarian to be caught out in a tabloid scandal, but Lord Sewel could be the first to be kicked out of the Lords, after footage showing him apparently snorting cocaine with prostitutes. The former Labour minister has been forced to resign as deputy speaker, an £85,000 a year post in the Upper Chamber. I, john, Lord Sewel, do swear by almighty God... He has also stepped down as chairman of the Lords conduct committee, a group that could now investigate him after a formal complaint by the Liberal Democrats. The problem is that the damage Lord Sewel has done on the Lords now. If he is an honourable man, you will understand that and take retirement straightaway. There are a number of ways that a peer can be removed from the House of Lords, but the process can take months. If a peer resigns, they leave immediately, although they do keep their title. They can be suspended if a committee says they have broken the code of conduct. And since March, a Lord can be expelled, but it has not happened yet. The law has recently changed, so in theory Lord Sewel could be booted out of the House of Lords for good. But it’s not clear what if any rule he has actually broken. There is a code of conduct, but that relates mainly to financial matters like fiddling expenses. Peers are, though, expected to act according to personal honour. That, though, has never been defined. The reputation of the House of Lords has taken a battering iI’I I’âCâI’Il yâ8IâS. Several peers have been suspended after falsely claiming expenses. All were allowed back, even one who had been to prison. One of Labour’s leadership contenders says more needs to be done to clean up Parliament. People are really fed up with the way things are and we need to work hard, all of us, to start to rebuild that faith and that trust that has been so badly damaged by these recent revelations, but also more generally over recent times. It could be a long time before Lord Sewel’s future is settled. In the meantime, if he shows up at the Lords, he will be allowed to These investigations have prompted Lord Sewel to take a temporary leave of absence until the investigations have included. Police in South Yorkshire have found a body on a building site believed to be that of a missing 7-year-old Conley Thompson, who’s from Worsbrough near Barnsley, didn’t return home after going to play with friends in a local park yesterday evening. They did look for Conley until the early hours last night but it was not until this morning that his body was found here. The more it appears that he died as the result of a freak accident. A building site on the edge of Barnsley, sealed off by police after a child’s body was found here. Emergency services were alerted to the discovery at about 8:30am this morning. Officers searching for a missing seven-year-old were quickly on the scene. A fewer hours later, detectives said they believed it was the body of Conley Thompson, who lived nearby and who disappeared on his way home last night. It’s devastating, it’s a shock, isn’t it? Things like that you don’t expect it to happen in your own area. But it’s happened and it’s upsetting. His mother is lovely, she’s a nice person. She’s lovely. What about Conley? He were boisterous, but a lovely little nipper. What sort of lad was he, what was he like? He was a good lad, kind and helpful. Seven-year-old Conley was last seen alive in Locke Park last night. He should have arrived home but he never did. This morning his body was found in a building site is a short distance from where he lived. The building site does have security fencing but locals say that children are often roaming here. We know that he has got through a small hole at the top of the construction site and because it has been wet, he has slid down and gone through a vertical pipe. People who knew the seven-year-old have come to leave flowers. This does appear to have been an awful accident at the start of the school summer holidays. A postmortem examination is still to take place and officially police are saying that his death is unexplained. What this does underline is the benign dangers that these building sites present to people who stray into them, thinking that they could be some sort of playground or bit of fun. The danger is really underlined by what happened here to this little seven-year-old. A man has been shot dead in Greater Manchester, in what police are calling a targeted attack. Police Paul Massey, a former candidate for Mayor of Salford, was killed outside his home. He had previously served a prison sentence for stabbing a man outside a nightclub. David Cameron has used the first day of his tour of South East Asia to agree measures to counter the threat from so-called Islamic State. Speaking injakarta, Mr Cameron said 50 Indonesian police officers would be trained in counter-terrorism techniques in the UK. He also promised the UK help in increasing airport security there. Our Political Correspondent Ben Wright is travelling with the Prime Minister, and this report contains flash photography. They lead countries thousands of miles apart but share a common enemy. Both David Cameron and the Indonesian president are determined to destroy so-called Islamic State. Indonesia has the world’s largest Muslim population and David Cameron said there was much Britain could learn from here about tackling extremism. We are both concerned about the threat from Isil and we are determined to defeat these terrorists. We will step up our efforts to counter the extremist narrative. He said Britain would help in beefing up airport security injakarta and Bali. A chance to be the global statesman tackling a global threat. the global statesman tackling a globalthreat. David global threat. David Cameron’s visit to Southeast Asia and his meeting with the Indonesian President is all about doing deals and finding new markets for Britain. But the two leaders are also trading information and expertise about dealing with Islamic extremism. People from here as well as Britain have gone in their hundreds to fight with Isil in Syria and Iraq. And the fight against IS is global. This is an IS stronghold in Libya. The country has two rival governments and lawlessness is growing. Today David Cameron said he could intervene again if there is a direct threat to Britain. If there is a plot under way where I believe British citizens are in danger of being targeted, if it’s possible to take action to stop that, I would. it’s possible to take action to stop that, Iwould. That that, I would. That is legal, that is right, that is proper, and that is the role of the Prime Minister. David Cameron and his host do not agree on everything, in particular the fate of foreign nationals awaiting execution in Indonesia by firing squad for drug smuggling. In 2013 58-year-old grandmother Lindsey Sandyford from Cheltenham was sentenced to death for carrying £1.6 million of cocaine into Bali. So far government pressure has been ignored by Indonesia and Mr Cameron said he would raise the case again. But not too publicly. Indonesia, like the other countries David Cameron will visit on this trip, are places Britain is eager to deal with. Ben Wright, BBC News, jakarta. Our top story this evening...

Shares in China have suffered their biggest one-day fall in the past eight years. That’s despite recent efforts by the government to support the market. The main index in Shanghai closed today more than eight percent down. Analysts say it was triggered by poor economic results which have raised concerns about the health of the world’s second largest economy. Our China Editor Carrie Gracie explains. For three weeks, the Chinese government managed to hold off the storm. But today, it broke. Beijing was just congratulating itself on masterminding a rally when the stock market saw its biggest one-day fall in eight years. This is the stuff of nightmares for a government which likes to be in control. Why today and why the scale of the rout? No-one really knows. The only predictable thing about this market now is its unpredictaability. And the alarm it is spreading, not just in China but around the world. China is hugely important to the world economy. If things continue like this, the central bank will buy its own shares in the companies in the country. China cannot get weak because otherwise the world economy will have a problem and Greece will look like a children’s birthday party in comparison. Chinese stocks long ago lost touch with fundamentals. They more than doubled in the past year. Despite the sluggish performance of many of the companies listed. And a slowdown in the economy. The bubble burst in mid-june. Share prices fell 30% in the space of three weeks. Many called it a healthy correction, but the government called it BFI âITIâI’gâI’ICy. Pumping money into the market and forcing big players to buy, not sell. Even today, some Shanghai investors are hoping that their luck will turn again. The market dropped a lot not too long ago and I was not especially anxious. I think the market has reached its lowest. There is not much space for further fall, that is my personal opinion. I think it will rebound. Everyone here is now holding their breath for what happens when trading opens tomorrow. The Chinese government has deep pockets, but even it must now ask itself, what does it have to throw at this market and for how long, to stave off a full-scale crash? One of the two main suspects in the murder in London of the former Russian agent Alexander Litvinenko today failed to give evidence at the inquiry into his death. Dmitry Kovtun had been due to speak via video link from Moscow today but said he’d been unable to get permission to do so from Russian authorities. Mr Kovtun is wanted regarding the poisoning of Mr Litvinenko with radioactive polonium nine years ago. Gordon Corera is at the Royal Courts ofjustice. Gordon, what’s the significance of Mr Kovtun’s no show? Well, Dmitry Kovtun was supposed to begin three days of evidence behind me, answering some of the evidence against him via video link because if he had stepped foot in this country, he would be arrested on suspicion of the murder of Alexander Litvinenko. But those video screens were blank this morning. Why? Because Dmitry Kovtun had expressed last-minute concerns that giving evidence might put him in breach of Russian confidentiality agreements regarding their investigations. I have to say that there was quite a degree of scepticism within the enquiry here today about that. The chairman, Sir Robert Owen, said he had suspicions that this was part of an attempt to manipulate the process, so that Mr Kovtun could say he had been denied the chance to answer evidence against him. He was given another chance to appear at 9am tomorrow morning, but most people here think the chances of them doing so are very low. What does this tell us? Years after the death of Alexander Litvinenko, it still shows that the friction between London and Moscow caused by this case is still continuing.

Bobbi Kristina Brown - daughter of the late Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown - has died in a tragic echo of her mother’s death three years earlier.

The only child of a superstar- Whitney Houston was one of the world’s bestselling artists - Bobbi Kristina grew up in the shadow of her mother’s drug problem and troubled marriage to the singer, Bobby Brown. Her parents divorced when she was 14 and she went on to appear in a reality TV show. But any hope of emulating her mother’s singing success floundered. She called her foster brother, Nick Gordon, her husband, but it was denied they were actually married. It was he who found her unconscious and a short while ago it was announced that officials plan to reconstruct events leading up to her death. Throughout this week, thousands of young digital pioneers - aged from 7 to 17 - are gathering around the country to create the technologies of the future.

They have already got plenty of computer programming skills. It is a whole new perspective to the world. Because there was another world behind coding that you would never know until you actually try it. I like creating things on my own, but there is so much that other people can give you and all these different areas of expertise. And it is fun to work with people you do not normally get a chance to see. It is quite fun, and you learn new skills. You get to code with developers who are doing interesting things. This is the Premier League of young coders and are more of them are 70 centres around the UK. They will have a lot of fun this week but there is a serious point. It has been estimated that British companies will need another three quarters of a million people with digital skills over the next couple of years. All of the companies say that they are desperately trying to recruit developers at the moment and they do not find them in the UK, so they have to go overseas to bring in talent. The young coders have got until the end of the week to come up with something brilliant. Then they will converge on Birmingham where the winning ideas will be chosen. And after that, who knows? These could be the creators of the next Google or Facebook. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s john Hammond. john, has anyone had good weather? Now, but we are British. And we carry on.

According to the latest government figures up to 13,000 people a year have been trafficked within the UK.

And the Surrey gardens celebrating the county’s connection to Alice in Wonderland on the 150th anniversary of the children’s classic. Good evening and welcome to the programme with me, Victoria Hollins. There have been renewed calls for tighter legislation surrounding the sale of legal highs following the death of a teenager in South East London. 18-year-old Ally Calvert collapsed in the street in Bexley, after he’s thought to have taken so-called laughing gas at a party. It’s estimated 17 people in the UK died after taking nitrous-oxide between 2006 and 2012. Sarah Harris reports. Friends of Ally Calvert coming to the place where he collapsed after a party on Saturday night on the Thamesmead estate in Southeast London. The 18-year-old had onlyjust left college and was hoping to be an electrician. But friends said he died after a heart attack after inhaling nitrous oxide. Parents on the estate are campaigning for the drug to be banned. They should ban anyone from selling them. It is estimated 500,000 young people take what’s known as laughing gas often from a balloon. It’s used in the catering trade and possession is perfectly legal. This young user who doesn’t want to be identified explained its appeal. ~ I enjoy the high. It is a short high. It lasts 60 seconds. Quite unlike alcohol or cigarettes. Some people prefer to experience that kind of state rather than an inebriated state like alcohol. It is widely used in the catering industry. That is how it is easily purchased. It is going to be quite hard to force legislation around this. Friends and family have been leaving floral tributes here and are asking the same question. How did a fit and healthy 18-year-old having only drunk moderately and taking a legal substance have died so suddenly? The results of a postmortem are expected later in the week. Lots more to come including: The new kids on the block - we look at the rise of the scooter-commuter. A few people have said it is a bit different. People are morejealous that I am riding a scooter and they are barking.-- that I am riding a scooter and they are barking. -- walking. 400 children and teenagers in the capital have been deemed at such high risk of radicalisation they have been referred to the Government counter terrorism programme - Channel. That’s the first time we’ve had a figure for London. Our Correspondent Alex Bushill has been looking at the numbers and joins me now. What do these figures tell us? The Channel programme is designed to intervene where somebody is believed to be at risk of radicalisation. The individual can be removed from their school or home. A variety of different agencies will then be involved to devise a specific year patronage for that individual. Bat specific care package. Obviously there were the schoolgirls from Bethnal Green earlier this year. The figures tell us that 169 Londoners have been referred to the Channel programme since it began in 2012. The capital accounts for a quarter of the total national referrals. Of the rebels, 400 are children or teenagers. Nationally that ties in with the year-on-year trend. -- that ties in with the year-on-year trend. -- of the 400. These figures team from a question raised by a Labour assembly member.

I get picked up, maybe, three men in their car and they would take me off to wherever. I can’t remember some of the names of the places. Different cities. If you tried to move large quantities of drugs into the UK, chances are you would get caught. If you try and move firearms into the UK, chances are you’ll get caught. If you move people, chances are you’ll get away with it. We’ll be hearing the stories of three young women, trafficked as children - in one case for over 16 years. Also tonight: Police pay a visit to the London home of the peer caught allegedly taking drugs with prostitutes. A warning that the most vulnerable in society may not be looked after if carers are paid the new National Living Wage. As David Cameron says Britain will take action against Libya if there is a direct terror threat to the UK, we report on life after Gaddafi. And the daughter of singer Whitney Houston dies - just as her mother did - after being found unconscious in the bath. Later on BBC London: The electronic tag which knows you have been drinking. And the hundreds of Londoners at risk of radicalisation. Good evening. The first part of the Modern Slavery Act comes into effect later this week, which means that trafficking anyone into or around the UK can result in a life sentence, up from 14 years. Ending human trafficking has become a priority for the Government, that is, ending the movement of people by force, fraud or deception, with the aim of exploiting them. The latest government figures suggest up to 13,000 people in the UK are victims of modern slavery, but it could be many more. This week BBC News at Ten is investigating the hidden cost of human trafficking in a series of special reports, in the United States, in Nigeria and here in the UK. I’ve been talking to three young women who were trafficked as children, here. This is their story. I get picked up, maybe three men in a car and they take me off to wherever. I can’t remember the names of the places. When you are inside the hole, there is no light. Everywhere is black. I was like that. You are not fighting against one man, you are fighting against a network of them. The voices you just heard speak of a lost childhood. Three young women trafficked into this country when they were children and their stories, though shocking, are far from uncommon. They chose to speak anonymously because they still fear reprisals from the men who trafficked them. One woman was 15 when she was flown from Nigeria to the UK illegally with the promise of education. Instead, she was a slave. I worked from 5am until 9pm at night every day. It was myjob to wake the kids, get them ready for school, do the washing and cleaned the whole house. Then I fetched the kids from school, did their homework, cooked dinner and cleaned. Everything had to be cleaned before I could go to bed. In the nine years you were working, did you ever have a day off? No, I never had a day off. She never went to school as she had been promised either. She was isolated and entirely friendless and to the year ago a local pastor helped her to escape. I still feel broken. I don’t know how to make friends any more. That damage is still there. It is going to be there forever and ever. The government estimates that 13,000 people are victims of modern slavery in the UK, but in the last year, only 130 traffickers were convicted. If you try to move large quantities of drugs into the UK, the chances are you get caught. If you try and move Firearms into the UK, the chance you get caught. You move people, the chances are you get away with it and that needs to change. It is notjust girls being brought into the UK. British girls are also being trafficked here, taken from city to city, often for sex. It is happening in the middle of our communities, often in plain sight. One girl was 14 when she was first sexually abused by a man who offered her a job. sexually abused by a man who offered herajob. He passed her on two other men up and down the country. She was trafficked for 16 years. I was taken by one group of men to another group of men. I did see money change hands. They were paying for me. Did you have any say in what was going on? No, I’ll was not allowed until they had all finished with me. Until they had raped you? How many men do you think rape due? I do not have a How many men do you think rape due? Ido not have a clue. I could How many men do you think rape due? I do not have a clue. I could not even give you a rough idea. More or less than 100? I would say more. It would definitely be more. Did you try and get help from anybody? My mum called the police the first time but they said to her I was a known prostitute and I would stop when I was ready. She should just leave me to it. The police described you as a known prostitute when you were 14 or 15? Yes. There is no such thing as a child prostitute. There is no offence of child prostitution, they are victims of crime. That is what the police need to be saying to people that they are victims. Child trafficking cases can be complex to investigate with children from often troubled backgrounds being driven across the country to be abused by different men. jane was 13 when she was first trafficked for sex. She said her nine-year ordeal was even more traumatising because the police, social services and other agencies failed to believe she was a victim. I think the worst experience is when the agencies become like your traffickers. With the attacks it hurts, but you get better. But not being believed or being tested or been told you don’t fit a criteria, and that night he would not have heard anywhere to sleep, so your only option was to sleep rough go back to traffickers, that the worst. The Salvation Army helped free jane from her traffickers year ago, but the trauma she suffered is ever present. The threats and violence she suffered have damaged her, possibly forever. I have had surgery on my face, after having broken bones. From being punched? From being beaten. I have had to have surgery down below because of abrasions, tears, cuts, burns. Obviously because of the rough sex and having sex with multiple men. And some of it was because they have inserted sharp objects in that area which caused cuts. How many operations have you had? I have had around six. Do you need more surgery? Yes, two more. Sometimes it has left you in constant. It has left you in continent? Yes, collapsed muscles in that area. And you are in your early 20s? Yes. Will you be able to have children? I am not sure. The experience ofjane will haunt them for the rest of their lives. Tomorrow we’ll have another report in the series, focusing on trafficking from Nigeria. If you or someone you know has been affected by trafficking, go to the modern slavery website or call the helpline on the screen now. Police with a sniffer dog have visited the London home of a peer caught allegedly taking drugs with prostitutes. Lord Sewel has taken a leave of absence from the House of Lords after repeated calls for him to resign. Our correspondent Vicki Young is at Westminster now. Lord Sewel’s fellow peers are unlikely to be satisfied with merely a leave of absence. That is right. Russia has been going on Lord Sewel all day. That is the cause it is about more than one man’s career or his personal embarrassment. Peers believe he has brought the House of Lords into disrepute and he should quit immediately. Take a quiet way out of the back door, is the way one person put it. This will add to the sense of distrust that many voters already feel towards their politicians. at the block of flats where Lord Sewel lives in central London. The Metropolitan Police have launched a criminal investigation into allegations of drug taking. No arrests have been made. Lord Sewel is not the first parliamentarian to be caught out in a tabloid scandal. But he could be the first to be kicked out of the Lords, after footage showing him apparently snorting cocaine with prostitutes. Colleagues expressed their shock and amazement at the revelations. The Prime Minister, on a trip to Indonesia, suggested the peer should think carefully about his future. I’m sure further questions will be asked about whether it is appropriate to have someone legislating and acting in the House of Lords, if they have genuinely behaved in this way. The former Labour minister has been forced to resign as Deputy Speaker. An £85,000 a year post in the upper chamber. I, john Sewel swear by Almighty God... He has also stepped down as the Chairman of the Lords conduct committee, a group that could now investigate him after a formal complaint by the Liberal Democrats. The problem is that the damage Lord Sewel has done on the Lords now and if he is an honourable man, he will understand that and take retirement straightaway. Instead, he has written to officials asking to take a leave of absence from the House. He also says: I have no intention of returning until the current investigations have been completed. And in the light of their outcome, I will review my long-term position. The reputation of the House of Lords has taken a battering in recent years, several peers have been suspended after falsely claiming expenses. All were allowed back, even one who had been to prison. One of Labour leadership’s contenders says more needs to be done to clean up Parliament. People are fed up of how things are and we need to all work hard to start to rebuild that faith and trust that has been so badly damaged by these recent revelations but also more generally over recent times. Removing a Lord can take months. Unless he resigns and leaves immediately. They can be suspended if a committee says they have broken the code of conduct and the Lord can be expelled. The law has recently changed. In theory, Lord Sewel could be booted out of the House of Lords for good. But it’s not clear what, if any rule he has actually broken. There is a code of conduct, but that’s mainly relates to financial matters like fiddling expenses. Peers are expected to act according to personal honour. That, though, has never been defined. These headlines have proved extremely damaging for one politician. Some believe this scandal shows the whole House of Lords is unaccountable to the people it is supposed to serve. Let’s take a brief look at some of the day’s other news stories. Manchester Royal Infirmary closed its Accident and Emergency department this afternoon, after identifying two suspected cases of the potentially fatal virus MERS, or Middle Eastern Respiratory Virus Syndrome. The two patients have been put in isolation and the department reopened earlier this evening. A missing seven-year-old boy who was found dead on a construction site in South Yorkshire died after slipping down into a plastic pipe, his grandmother has said. Conley Thompson from Worsbrough near Barnsley, didn’t return home after going out to play yesterday evening. Police are continuing to investigate the circumstances of his death. The remains of a fourth person have been recovered from the site of a mill explosion in Cheshire. Four workers at Wood Treatment Limited in Bosley - Derek Moore, Dorothy Bailey, jason Shingle and William Barks - were all unaccounted for after blast ten days ago. Government plans to introduce the so-called National Living Wage could lead to ""catastrophic failure"" for people who need to be cared for in their own homes, according to the leading care providers. In an open letter to the Chancellor, seen by the BBC, the UK Homecare Association is warning its members won’t be able to pay the extra cost of the wage rise, which was introduced in the Budget, unless the Government provides more funding. Our Social Afffairs Correspondent Alison Holt has more. Hello? It’s another busy day for Heather Pugh, she’s here to help 94-year-old Betty Turner with her lunch and her medicine. Are you feeling all right today? Yeah. As a care worker, Heather provides people with help with daily tasks like washing and dressing. For many like Betty, it’s vital support. I couldn’t live here, if they weren’t here. I’d have to go into a home. Which I don’t... Want to do. Because I love my little flat. And as I am at the moment, I’m very, very happy. Heather is paid more than the minimum wage of £6.50 an hour, but many care workers are not. So the new national living wage, which will increase pay for over-25s to £9 per hour by 2020, will make a significant difference. That couple of pound an hour overall pay can make a big difference in the long run. It would also draw more people into want to do caring, because once you get into it, you see what a fantasticjob it is. But now, many of the companies that provide home care have written to the Chancellor, saying they are seriously worried about where the extra money to pay that higher wage bill will come from. This meeting brought together firms from across the UK. Most of the care they provide is bought by cash-strapped councils. Unless that is properly funded, we’re actually heading for a catastrophic disaster. At the end of the day, it is all about the people we serve. And we have a huge number of silent victims, people locked behind front doors. They can’t get out into the community, they can’t get out and interact with other people. Theyjust need basic services. You don’t have to spend long in that meeting to get a real sense ofjust how worried the people who provide care are about their ability to get the sums to add up. When they have the new National Living Wage, they want to keep standards high. And at the same time, they have a squeeze on funding. At the moment, the providers say local authorities pay them an average of £13.66 and hour for home care. But they estimate it will actually cost £16.70 an hour to meet the full cost of increased wages, travel and training. There is certainly anxiety. That providers will be going out of business. And those providers won’t be there to carry on delivering services, for some of the most frail and vulnerable members of society. In a statement, the Government says the national living wage will benefit hundreds of thousands of care workers. And that overall cost of providing social care will be considered, during the spending review, later this year. In a sector that provides 47 million hours of home care a year for people like Betty, they know they need to find a solution. The Prime Minister has said Britain is prepared to take military action in Libya, if there is a direct terror threat to Britain. David Cameron was speaking on his way to Indonesia for a four-day tour of South East Asia. The regime of Colonel Gaddafi in Libya ended four years ago. It’s now a divided country, with two rival governments and its people are struggling to rebuild their lives. Our World Affairs editor john Simpson sent this report from the capital, Tripoli. Four years after the fall of Colonel Gaddafi, this country’s hopes for the future are being wrecked. Some people here now even say they wish Gaddafi was back. At first sight, things look reasonable enough. Then you start to see the damage. just about all embassies closed. Every international hotel shut down. The airport has been destroyed. Scarcely any foreigners come here, nowadays. A few months ago this big-news shopping centre was attacked. Because Islamic extremists said men and women were using it, to meet each other. And there are other forms of damage. At the biggest hospital in Tripoli, they are sending this man away, because they can’t treat his serious heart condition. He is having to pay the ambulance £1,000, to drive him to neighbouring Tunisia, where the operation will cost a fortune. Three years ago, there were 1,500 nurses here, mostly from abroad, now there are only 250 of them, not usually very highly trained. We found Ali, looking after his ten-month-old son, Adam. He desperately needs a bone marrow transplant, but the hospital simply can’t carry it out. It all comes down to politics, here. But different parties can’t agree. There are two opposing governments. Nothing gets done. Including little Adam’s operation. We are suffering, we don’t have medicine. Please, please, I’m begging the people at the top of parliament, please, you have to sit together. Forget what we have, we have to go forward. Otherwise, we are going to lose our country and we are going to lose our children. In a cafe, here, I met a group of students. Two of whom had come home after university in Britain. I am in shock. But, there is no other way. Either take it and turn it to the good of the people, the good of the country or your country will collapse. It is on the edge of collapse. You have to be optimistic about the future of our country. If not we, then who? The power vacuum is a useful opportunity for Islamic State, so-called. In january, it blew up a Tripoli hotel. When I met the Prime Minister of the Tripoli government, I asked him if he would take up Britain’s offer of help in dealing with IS. TRANSLATION: We don’t reject any offers of help to kill this disease, because this disease will affect the international community and we won’t let the terrorists have any stronghold in Libya. But Libya’s chaos really matter to us? Well, Europe begins only about 200 miles from here. It’s too close for comfort. Shares in China have suffered their biggest one-day fall in the past eight years. That’s despite recent efforts by the government to support the market. The main index in Shanghai closed today, more than 8% down. Analysts say it was triggered by weak economic results and a lack of confidence in the world’s second largest economy. Our China editor Carrie Gracie explains. For three weeks, the Chinese government managed to hold off the storm. But today, it broke. Beijing was just congratulating itself on masterminding a rally when the stock market saw its biggest one-day fall in eight years. This is the stuff of nightmares for a government which likes to be in control. Why today and why the scale of the rout? No one really knows. The only predictable thing about this market now is its unpredictability. And the alarm it’s spreading, not just in China but around the world. TRANSLATION: China is hugely important to the world economy. If things continue like this, the Central Bank will buy its own shares in the companies in the country. China cannot get weak, because otherwise the world economy will have a problem and Greece will look like a children’s birthday party in comparison. Chinese stocks long ago lost touch with fundamentals. They more than doubled in the past year, despite the sluggish performance of many of the companies listed. And a slowdown in the economy. The bubble burst in mid-june. Share prices fell 30% in the space of three weeks. Many called it a healthy correction, but the government called it BFI âITIâI’gâI’ICy. Pumping money into the market and forcing big players to buy, not sell. Even today, some Shanghai investors are hoping that their luck will turn again. TRANSLATION: The market dropped a lot not too long ago and I was not especially anxious. I think the market has reached its lowest. There is not much space for further falls, that is my personal opinion. I think it will rebound back. Everyone here is now holding their breath for what happens when trading opens tomorrow. The Chinese government has deep pockets, but even it must now ask itself,what it has to throw at this market and for how long, to stave off a full-scale crash? Bobbi Kristina Brown, daughter of the late Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown, has died in a tragic echo of her mother’s death, three years earlier. Bobbi was 22 and had been found unconscious in her bath, six months ago. Her mother was found dead in a bath after overdosing on drugs. David Willis reports from Los Angeles. Bobbi Kristina Brown died six months after going into a coma. Found in a bath tub at her home in Atlanta, the initial indication was that she had drowned. Bobbi Kristina’s death a chilling echo of events at this Beverly Hills hotel three and a half years ago, when Whitney Houston was found dead in her bath tub, having taken prescription drugs and cocaine. One of the first people on the scene that day, was Bobbi Kristina Brown. But it appears the circumstances surrounding Bobbi Kristina’s death at this hospice on the outskirts of Atlanta may be less clean cut. In the last few hours, officials have said they intend to mount a full investigation and it could be several weeks before they determine a formal cause of death. The only child of a superstar, Bobbi Kristina grew up in the shadow of Whitney Houston’s drug and alcohol problems, not to mention Houston’s tumultuous marriage to the singer Bobby Brown. They divorced when Bobbi Kristina was 14 and she spoke of her struggle to cope with her mother’s death in an interview with Oprah Winfrey. If you were to ask me this ago I would have said I would not be able to get through it. I would have said no. I would have gone right there. I would not have got through it at all. But you’re getting through it? Yeah, yeah, Iam. The only heir to Whitney Houston’s multi-million fortune, Bobbi Kristina featured in a reality TV show along with this man, Nick Gordon, her foster brother who she said later became her husband. Family members deny they were ever legally married. It was he who found her unconscious in the bath. Reaction to Bobbi Kristina’s death was swift. Peace at last, wrote Oprah Winfrey. ""My heart is heavy"", said Missy Elliott while her mother’s cousin, Dionne Warwick, described her as a sweetheart adding ""She’s in better hands, now"". Bobbi Kristina Brown is expected to be buried on the outskirts of New York, alongside her mother. Newsnight is starting over on BBC 2 now with a special investigation into how the assassins of Alexander Litvinenko nearly got away with committing the perfect murder. It is time for the news where you are. Welcome to BBC London News with me, Alex Bushill. Repeat offenders across London who’re convicted of alcohol-related crimes could be forced to wear ankle tags that monitor their drinking. After a trial in four London boroughs - it’s been decided to extend the scheme to help criminals stay sober. The charity, Alcohol Concern say up to half of all crime has alcohol linked to it. With the details, here’s our political correspondent Karl Mercer. You put the breathalyser around the ankle. This was the Mayor in Croydon in a year ago, launching a project to tag drinkers, not alcoholics, but people accused of things like drink-driving or assaults. 12 months and £120,000 later, City Hall is hailing the scheme a success. 100 of the 111 people who were tagged in four south London boroughs, stayed off the drink. It will be rolled out eventually across the capital. Today’s important because we have a technology that is working, that is keeping people away from using alcohol, stopping them from committing crime. When does it go London-wide? That’ll be something that as soon as I sign it off, it will go London wide, and as soon is we feasibly can. Let’s say that it will be this calendar year, we will be able to sign it off across London, and from that stage, let’s see it go national as soon as possible. The idea initially came from America where offenders in South Dakota had to report in everyday for breath tests. Under this scheme, it is all done electronically. These are sobriety tags that are being used in the pilot. They test the person’s sweat for the presence of alcohol every half-hour. It is quite easy? They are securely placed onto the person’s ankle. Readings are taken every half-hour, and sent to the individual’s probation officer. When you drink alcohol, 1% comes out completely unchanged through the skin, so we use the term in the States stinking drunk, sometimes, to refer to the person after they have been drinking alcohol. That is the exact principle we are using with these tags. This is the sort of thing the scheme aims to stamp out. More than half of those tagged in the last year were for drink-related violence. While the success of the pilot has been welcomed, some say more has to be done to stop problem drinking. It is estimated to cost the government £21 billion a year. That is an awful lot of money that won’t be solved by a few people who have committed crimes wearing a sobriety tag. What it needs is much more systemic action from the government, such as increasing the minimum unit price. City Hall is promising to find the money to roll out the scheme across London by the end of the year. 400 children and teenagers in the capital have been deemed at such high risk of radicalisation they have been referred to the government counter terrorism programme - Channel. That’s the first time we’ve had a figure for London. Our reporter Katharine Carpenter has been looking at the numbers and joins me now. Remind usa Remind us a little bit more about what this programme is? It aims to identify at the earliest possible stage anyone who might be vulnerable to radicalisation. They could be vulnerable through their school, their community or religious leaders. Once they are referred to the programme, a number of different agencies will get involved. The idea is to turn that person’s life around, to change the course of their life. That could mean removing them from their school, changing where they live or putting them on a mentoring programme. It is all part of the government’s wider anti-extremism initiative called Prevent. And for the first time we have an idea of the numbers involved. We know 1069 Londoners have been referred to the Channel scheme since it started in 2012. That is about a quarter of the national figure of That is about a quarter of the nationalfigure of 4000 national figure of 4000 referrals nationally. Perhaps the most shocking statistic is the number of young people involved. Since September last year, 418 ‘s have been referred. Those statistics were brought to light by a member of the London Assembly. He said there should be more support for grassroots projects tackling radicalisation. We are keen to see that community-based anti-radicalisation programmes are still supported because actually, by the time the police get involved, in some ways we would have lost the battle. The head of the Met’s counterterrorism command welcomes the figures. He said it is a sign that people understand the dangers of extremism and the need to speak out and supported. Thank you. A murder investigation’s been launched following the discovery of human remains near Bracknell in Berkshire. Workmen, clearing ditches near Warfield, made the discovery on Friday afternoon. It’s believed the remains were at least two years old and are that of a man. Officers are now trying to identify him and establish the cause of death. Supercar drivers who read their engines or perform stunts around Knightsbridge could see their cars towed away. Residents say the noise disturbs their sleep and makes their lives intolerable. Kensington and Chelsea are considering bringing in a protection order. A whole range of offences are committed. The council working in partnership with the police, the noise nuisance team, will be able to get this evidence and in extremesis refer the offender to the Magistrates Court, and magistrates will be able to take very tough action, either high-level fines or in the worst case, actually impounding a car, removing a car from the street. Mayor Boris johnson has apologised after giving his wife a lift on the back on his bike - in an apparent breach of road regulations. The pictures - obtained by the Sun - were taken from a passing car in North Kensington last week. A spokesman for the Mayor said he unaware he was doing anything illegal. And just time to let you know you can catch the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan Howe, tomorrow morning on our radio station BBC London 94.9. He’ll be answering your questions from 8am. That’s it for now from me, but let’s find out what the weather’s up to with Wendy. Why has the sunshine gone? I know. It is a bit autumnal. The breeze will take us through the night. The cloud may produce the odd spot of rain here and there. It will be a fairly mild night. Temperatures will be around 11 to 14 degrees. We will wake up to some cloud first thing tomorrow morning. The remnants of a weather front slipping away northwards. There should be much better spells of sunshine than today. It may feel a bit cool, even though temperatures will get to around 21 degrees. The start of the week and looks like a tangle of weather front and a lot of isobars. That is what you can see. This is what it looks like towards the end, far fewer isobars. That will translate with calmer conditions. The temperature very slowly picking UP The temperature very slowly picking up as we go through the week. More in the National forecast now. Good evening. Believe me, we are doing all we can to find you some warmer weather but we are failing. What are we aiming for? Something around 21 degrees would be nice. We have got a long way to go. Particularly bleak today underneath this frontal zone where it was pouring with rain across northern England. And Scotland and Northern ",,

His words come after a third night of hundreds of attempts by migrants to cross the Channel Tunnel illegally. We’ll bring you the latest from Westminster, and from both sides of the Channel. Also this lunchtime. Debris of a plane washed up on an island in the Indian Ocean, could it belong to the missing Malaysia Airlines aircraft MH370? 6,000 jobs to go at Centrica despite profits at its British Gas business doubling.

A teenage boy has died in a canal in east London, his family had reported him missing. And, battling it out, the six Labour candidates for London Mayor go head to head over housing and the tube strike. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. David Cameron has insisted that Britain will not become what he called a ""safe haven"" for migrants in Calais, after a third night of large-scale attempts by people to cross the Channel Tunnel illegally. But the Prime Minister has come in for strong criticism for using the word ""swarm"" to describe them, with one charity calling his language inflammatory and de-humanising. The effect of the crisis continues with Operation Stack, where lorries park on the M20 in Kent because of Channel Tunnel delays, set to run into the weekend. And there are calls from some for British troops to be deployed in Calais, if the French authorities agree. Christian Fraser is in Calais. Yes, there’s been lots of construction here this morning, banging of males in this little Sudanese community behind me. We are on the edge of the camp known as the jungle, and this plastic has been dropped off by a Catholic charity. This camp has grown to twice the size it was perhaps six months ago. Remember back in 2002 the row over the camp, the then Home Secretary David Blunkett called it a festering sore in the relationship between the UK and French governments. All the effort that went into it to try to close it down. I wonder what the UK Government would make of the organisation we have seen today. It is not yet sang at, but the camp known as De jonge Is Beginning To Look Permanent. It Has Ballooned Into A Small Village. Squalid But Surprisingly Organised. There Are Showers, A Shop, Even A Centre That Offers Advice On Uk Immigration. It’s That Same Spirit Of Organisation That Now Extends To The Nightly Attempts On The Tunnel. They Work In Groups, And In Tandem. Dusk is starting to full, many of the people here will have collected their food in these white plastic bags. Now they will set off on a ten kilometre walk towards Cocquelles and the Eurotunnel. If you are someone like this man who took three months to cross the desert, survived a Mediterranean crossing, then a thin police line and defence are of little deterrent. Do you think you will get there tonight, to England? Maybe, I’m not sure. Do you know people who have died trying? Yes, of course. David Cameron says Britain will not become a safe haven for swarms of migrants. What about the genuine cases, those fleeing persecution and torture, men like Mohammed from the Muslim brotherhood who finds it hard these days to climb talking to lorries. Your shoulders don’t work because you were tortured? Yes, yes. You cry a lot. What is it you think about? I think about this, if somebody sees me, here’s about mel think about this, if somebody sees me, here’s about me I am here or something, maybe catch my kids, my wife. Legally speaking, men like Mohammed could and should claim asylum here in France but they don’t. It remains the promised land. The French are finally responding. Last night 120 extra gendarmes were brought in. In the end we are told some 300 migrants reached the secure zone last night. They were cleared but a small number did reach Folkestone. A small success, and incentive enough for the many who keep trying. Should say, a lot of the materials you see around here are not supplied from the French state, they come from charities, refugee agencies, jim and in organisations. When they are not employed building shelters here in the day, the mainjob of work employed building shelters here in the day, the main job of work is to breach security at the tunnel. Last night 300 did get into a secure zone and a handful did manage to get through the tunnel to Folkestone. We can cross to the UK’s side. Those individuals now being dealt with by police as their colleagues across Kent try to untangle the traffic chaos that’s caused by every incursion on the Calais side. Behind me a twofold problem. On that side you can see operation Stack stretching away towards the coast, spread across both carriageways of the 24. On the other side a huge queue, cars and lorries forced onto the local road networks. Mile by mile, the columns of lorries are edging towards the Channel crossing points. Their number plates and liveries representing countries and companies across Europe and beyond. The news from passing police patrols is not encouraging. Despite some easing of the disruption, many drivers will still face 18 hours in the queues. The threat of continuing disruption is on everyone’s mind, here. Today the Prime Minister on a visit to the far east as knowledge pressure on all those dealing with the effects of the migrant crisis. This is very testing, I accept that. Because you’ve got a swarm of people coming across the Mediterranean, seeking a better life, wanting to come to Britain because Britain’s gotjobs, a growing economy, it’s an incredible place to live. But we need to protect our borders by working hand in glove with our neighbours, the French, and that’s exactly what we’re doing. But some drivers, trapped by event in Calais, are sceptical. Promises that improved border security alone will solve the problem. We spoke to Sean Swan, a regular traveller through the port. Certainly in France it does not look like a lot is happening. We certainly don’t see enough police. There are many migrants to be seen camping out, side of the road. Not many police. We are left out with the Eurotunnel terminal wide-open to threats of violence. And all sorts of things are happening out there. There were protests in which double earlier in the week over news that a former nursing home was to house a growing number of unaccompanied children and young people, many of whom are thought to have made their way across or under the Channel. County council is worth calling on the government to help. Back on the motorway there are signs of progress. Despite last night’s migrant activity, wheels are still rolling. But this round-the-clock operation still has some way to run. Well, operation Stack is destined to continue into another busy holiday weekend. One of the key bits of advice if families are needing to travel this way, if you cannot avoid the area, then allow plenty of time for the journey. And also check with social media. The ferry companies and Eurotunnel are putting constant updates on there. That’s really the best way to see what disruption lies ahead. Back to you. As you heard in the headlines the Prime Minister has been responding during his tour of Vietnam. He said Britain will not become a haven for migrants coming across the Mediterranean. Infact he said the situation has been very testing because there is a swarm of people coming across the Mediterranean. It is that word, swarm, that has attracted some criticism from certain quarters. Let’s get a reaction from our assistant political editor, Norman Smith. There has been a reaction from Downing Street? Yes, Downing Street have sought to play down the criticising, insisting Mr Cameron did not mean to disparage migrant. He goes on to refer to them as people seeking a better life. You sense that political debate is becoming increasingly heated and charged over the situation in Calais. There has been widespread criticism of Mr Cameron for using that word, swarm. Labour’s acting leader said he needed to remember he was talking about people, not insects. The Liberal Democrat leader said Mr Cameron was dehumanising some of the most desperate people in the world. The criticism comes at a time when you sense there is real pressure on Mr Cameron to consider much more radical options to try and resolve the situation in Calais. Because at the moment not much seems to be working. So there are now calls for Mr Cameron to press the French authorities to agree to allow the British Army to be deployed in Calais to ensure security, and also calls for the British government to consider building refugee camps in North Africa and the Middle East so the migrants can be repatriated. I have to say, my clear impression is that Mr Cameron is determined to stick with plan A. And that is to keep cooperating and working with the French. Because if those relations breakdown between Britain and France, then the fear is the situation could spiral out of control. Forthe situation could spiral out of control. For the moment thank you very much. The difficulty with a problem like that is or is finding a balance between those genuine asylum cases, to which Britain has always extended a helping hand and a welcome, and the quite legitimate aim of defending British borders, protecting lorry drivers and holiday-makers, who are having a miserable time around the terminals as groups of migrants tried to breach security. What we have seen on the evidence of this is that it will not be a unilateral response that will solve the problem, nor a response from the French and British governments. It is going to need a European solution. Investigators are examining a fragment of plane wreckage that has washed up on an island in the Indian Ocean, to see if it’s from the missing flight MH370. The Malaysian Airlines plane vanished without trace last year with 239 people on board, after taking off from Kuala Lumpur. The wreckage has been found more than 3,000 miles away on the island of Reunion. Our correspondent Andy Moore reports. Could this be the first physical piece of wreckage from the missing plane MH370? It looks like a small part of the back edge of a wing. It’s damaged, but largely intact. There are barnacles all over it. For the families, it’s an agonising discovery. jacquita’s husband was a flight attendant on the plane. On the one hand, she says she hopes for some definite news and for closure. But... The other part is that no, let it not be true, because then we can still have hope. There’s a chance that the plane is still out there and they can all come home. In the southern Indian ocean, the search for any trace of the plane beneath the waves goes on. There have been so many false leads before, but this news has been treated with cautious optimism. This is obviously a very significant development. It’s the first real evidence that there is a possibility that a part of the aircraft may have been found. It’s too early to make that judgment, but we are treating this as a major lead. The Malaysian Prime Minister says the part is very likely from a Boeing 777, but he says it’s too early to say whether it’s from MH370. It’s been taken to Toulouse for further examination by French air investigators. But is it plausible that wreckage from a plane that’s believed to have gone down off the southwestern coast of Australia would be found thousands of miles away on the other side of the ocean? Finding this piece of debris on Reunion island is entirely consistent with the current patterns in the southern Indian Ocean to be originating from the area they’re doing the current search for the wreckage at the bottom of the ocean. It’s been confirmed that there are markings on the piece of debris that should aid identification. In aviation, every single part of an aeroplane, all the millions of pieces have a serial number. You can track it back to the day it was manufactured. So yes, there will be markings on that which will tell Boeing if it is from a 777 and from MH370. This small piece of debris will now be examined in the minutest detail. Aviation investigators will want to be absolutely sure before they say whether it does belong to MH370. The Malaysians have said that process could take up to two days. Andy Moore, BBC News. Well our transport correspondent Richard Westcott is with me. If this is the plane, what happens next? Well, basically it is found on a French island so they are taking it to France to examine it. They will be looking for that serial number so they can identify it directly to MH370. They should know already whether it is from the right kind of aircraft, every aircraft has a unique shaped wing. I suspect Boeing engineers will look at the pictures and will know straightaway. Then they will start checking it for clues as to what happened. There is only so much you can tell. The fact it is a small piece could mean it broke up in midair, it could equally need it fell into the sea. They will look for small holes which might indicate some kind of explosion, if it was near the wing. Looking at the pictures you can’t see any obvious small holes, but that’s the kind of thing they’ll be looking for, just to try to trace how it got where it did. We found this piece, we know it crashed now for certain, or we will do when they confirm it. But that does not tell you how this part got where it got and what happened to the aircraft. The owner of British Gas, Centrica, has announced it’s cutting 6,000 jobs, 5,000 of them in the UK, despite half-yearly profits at British Gas doubling to £528 million. Centrica says the jobs are being shed to make it more internationally competitive. Our Business correspondent john Moylan reports. It has been a bumper six months for British Gas, with profits doubling at the UK’s biggest energy supplier, but with oil prices languishing, its parent company Centrica is facing tougher times and today said 6000 jobs would go. In order to compete effectively for our customers and ultimately be able to grow, we have to be as efficient as usable. In the near term we are having two, three that, faced the reality of a reduction in 6000 jobs and that’s very difficult thing to dol reduction in 6000 jobs and that’s very difficult thing to do I don’t take this lightly at all. In the six months tojune, operating profits hit £528 million, up a whopping 99%. But overall, Centrica’s profits fell slightly, to £1 billion, hit by falling oil prices. That surge in profits at British Gas will trouble customers like David and Carolyn, despite announcing to price cuts to gas this year, they think the company should have. It’s galling when you hear these large percentage increases by British Gas and the profits they have made. They are not really passing it down to the customer. There is still room for manoeuvre. British Gas is by far the biggest residential energy supplier. It says that up to 9 million households rely upon it for their energy needs and now it’s going to refocus on that huge customer base. They have got 26 million customers in the UK and North America, they are not really exploiting those relationships efficiently. If they can do that we can see profits per customer rise by about 30% if they get it right. In the future, and buoy will do less of this. This platform is part of a major investment it is making in a huge of the East Coast of England. The company says it will continue to focus on the North Sea but its change of strategy could have indications for how Britain meets its energy needs in years to come. And Royal Dutch Shell has also announced job cuts to the tune of 6,500. The company says the cost-cutting measure is due to the fall in the price of oil, and its effect on its profits. Royal Bank of Scotland has reported a half-year loss after setting aside more money for repaying customers and for potential legal settlements. The £153 million loss for the six months to the end ofjune compares with a £1.43 billion profit a year ago. Our top story this lunchtime. David Cameron says no to Britain becoming a safe haven for migrants - but is criticised for using the word swarm to describe them. And still to come: protests in Minnesota against the dentist who shot dead Cecil the lion. by developers who are opening a jack the Ripper museum in Whitechapel. Prince has performed in her living room and she’s supported Paloma Faith on tour- we hear from Lianne La Havas on her own musical achievements. There have been protests in Minnesota against the dentist who shot dead Cecil the lion in Zimbabwe. There’s still no word on where Walter Palmer is, but hundreds of people have been demonstrating outside his surgery. A professional hunter has appeared in court in Zimbabwe charged over Cecil’s death. Our correspondent Gary O’Donoghue sent this report. When animals are under attack, what do we do? Rise up, fight back! There weren’t the hundreds promised by the organisers, but those who did turn up made their views very clear. Stop the hunt! The message for Cecil’s killer couldn’t have been more stark. And the threats to him have driven him underground. You know, I don’t know if anything should happen to him, I’m not advocating for any violence to befall him, but it would be nice if he could be prosecuted for any laws that he broke. We’d like to see him fork over some money for conservation efforts in these lands where he’s hunting animals. Walter Palmer has said nothing beyond a brief written statement in which he expressed regret for killing Cecil. There was no sign of the dentist at his home in this leafy suburb of Minneapolis. Cecil was already famous in Zimbabwe, but his killing has catapulted him into a worldwide symbol for conservationists. There’s been no sign of Walter Palmer. Not surprising, really, when you read some of the things people want to do to him. As for these protesters here, well, they want him extradited to Zimbabwe to face charges. Gary O’Donoghue, BBC News, Bloomington, Minnesota. The leader of the UK Independence party Nigel Farage says the campaign to get Britain out of the EU needs to stop arguing about who will run it. David Cameron has promised an in-out vote by the end of 2017. Mr Farage warns that the No campaign could lose - simply because of splits and disagreements. Let’s speak to Eleanor Garnier, who’s at Westminster. How valid is his opinion is that the no campaign is losing? US captains I have been speaking to have disputed what he has said. They have told me they will be a unified no campaign UP they will be a unified no campaign up and running by September. Nigel Farage is causing a stir because he has launched his no campaign with an attack on the no campaign. He said this morning, excuse the language, that the no campaign needs to stop pitching and moaning and it off its backside because if it doesn’t, it’s in danger of losing the EU referendum before it is even started. Despite those harsh words, he has said he is happy to work with the rest of the no campaign and he intends to fight a positive campaign. You’ll hear no negativity from us once they have got off their backsides and decided to join this fight. We cannot allow Cameron to go into this renegotiation unchallenged, we cannot allow the yes side to have the massive head start that they got in the polls and in the general campaign in the country, and I would say to Eurosceptics of every hue in Britain, we’re going to be out there from the 1st of September, come and join us. He is already facing criticism that this is simply an attempt to crowbar himself into the position of leader, a senior Conservative Eurosceptic I have spoken to sit Nigel Farage is more interested in promoting himself and Labour Eurosceptic has told me they think this is simply an attempt to onto the leadership and they completely deny there is any infighting in the no campaign or thatitis infighting in the no campaign or that it is at war with itself. David Cameron and George Osborne are busy renegotiating Britain’s’s relationship with the other EU countries. Once they have done that, we will get the referendum and that has been promised before the end of 2017. An education charity has warned that changes to university funding in England, which were set out in the Budget, could leave students with debts lasting well into middle age and deter poorer school-leavers from applying to university. A study group set up by The Sutton Trust said almost half the money the Treasury lent to students would never be repaid. Here’s our Education Correspondent Robert Pigott. At the London Veterinary College, potential students learn how to examine a dog. The school pupils are being encouraged to apply for the best university courses of its kind in the world. The Sutton trust says better off school leavers are more than twice as likely to go to university as poorer ones. That gap has narrowed but the trust claims that the Chancellor’s decision to replace maintenance grant with loans and allow some universities to increase tuition fees from 2017 will make it a bigger issue. I know a lot of people who are amazing intellectually and they are not going to university because they can’t afford it. You’re coming out into a world full of pets, overdrafts, and you will have to repay this debt, have a mortgage, have a car and sustain a family and keep everyone happy, it’s not realistic in some cases. The underprivileged kids might feel bad on their parents if they go to uni, if your parents don’t have a lot of money, you don’t want to put pressure on them as well. There would- be There would-be vets could leave university owing more than £50,000. The Sutton Trust insists that with the government getting so little financial benefit from the extra burden on students, it’s time to review the whole system of loans to see if it still represents good value for money. We would like to see the Office of Budget Responsibility as a matter of urgency look at this whole question, is this scheme good value for the taxpayer? The government said it was committed to giving everyone the opportunity to get a degree, regardless of their ability to pay. And maintenance loans would give students more money to spend. The former hosts of Top Gear- jeremy Clarkson, james May and Richard Hammond - have signed a deal to present a motoring programme on the television streaming service Amazon Prime. Mr Clarkson - who was sacked from Top Gear earlier this year for hitting his producer- said he felt like he had climbed out of a bi-plane and into a spaceship. After yesterday’s excitement fingered fans, Australia have been fighting back. At lunch, England were 221-7, a lead ofjust 85. joe Wilson is there for us now. This Test match rushes on, almost out of control at times. England have got to 221, the bad news from their point of view is that they have lost four more wickets already. Perhaps we should remind ourselves that a Test match is supposed to be about patients. Still 114 miles of navigable canal in Birmingham, says the city council. It’s a vivid reminder you don’t always have to rush to reach your destination. It could have inspired England aspiration at the Test match for steady accumulation. Mitchelljohnson - well, he is quick, watch out. Bairstow gone for five. How do you play that? Ben Stokes couldn’t answer. Off gloves, to wicketkeeper, two wickets in johnston’s first over, match changing stuff, potentially. Australia’s only problem was that johnson couldn’t bowl from both ends. joe Root picked off Hazlewood’s delivery to nudge onwards England’s lead. Not for the first time, England relied on Root. A 13th Test match 50 and he’s stilljust 24. The problem for Australia was that they had little margin for error. They had only made 136 in theirfirst innings, a figure the captain remembered. just when England were almost relaxing, Root was gone, like that. ""What have I done?!"" England were 46 ahead but six wickets down. It’s not always pace that brings wickets. Nathan Lyon’s spin bowling jos Butler’s LBW like a slow motion torture. Next read the England captain’s expression. Why are we making this so hard? We love the tension. England are about to resume with Marine Ali and Stuart Broad, they are both betting aggressively. The lead stands at 85. If England can get the lead to 150, they will feel back in control. Some of the ceramic poppies displayed at the Tower of London last year are to tour the UK from September. The first three venues have been announced in Yorkshire, Northumberland and Liverpool and local communities can campaign to bring them to their area over the next 3 years. There were 888,246 poppies created - one for each British and Colonial soldier who died during World War 1. The travelling exhibition will feature 10,000 poppies. Let’s look at the weather now. Maybe a tiny hint of summer coming back, in the distance, surrounded by haze over the next few days! You might get a bit of warmth in the south of the country. Today is a mixture of sunshine, a few showers as well. Quite a few lumpy clouds across parts of Lincolnshire, East Anglia. Good news for Edgbaston, more fine weather for the rest of the day.

Good evening. 16 months after Flight MH37O disappeared without trace, investigators are examining a fragment of plane wreckage that’s washed up on an island in the Indian ocean, to determine whether it is from the missing aircraft. The Malaysian Airlines plane left Kuala Lumpur bound for Beijing, with 239 people on board. It was last seen on radar heading west over the Strait of Malacca, having veered off its original course. The debris appeared thousands of miles away, on the remote island of Reunion. jonathan Head sent this report from the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur. It is not much, a piece of a wing less than three metres long encrusted with barnacles and the tattered remains of a suitcase. Get more than 500 days after the disappearance of flight MH37O these mightjust be the first clues disappearance of flight MH37O these might just be the first clues to the greatest of aviation mysteries. Sometimes it is just hope. greatest of aviation mysteries. Sometimes it isjust hope. For families who have been waiting so long for any news, emotions today are inevitably mixed. I have been waiting for 509 days to see my husband again. Sol waiting for 509 days to see my husband again. So I selfishly hope it is not from MH370, get on the other hand, I know I have not mourned yet, so probably the other part of me is trying to have closure on that. It is a mixed feeling at the moment. It is the baffling absolutes of any physical evidence of flight MH370 which is given rise to the will during range of theories about what might have happened to it. If this chunk of a wing that has been found turned out to be from the missing outline of those theories will inevitably be narrowed down to the one always thought most likely, that the plane ended under the waves of the southern Indian ocean. The daybreak has been taken from this remote island to France for identification. Untilthen remote island to France for identification. Until then officials are being cautious about drawing conclusions. What ever wreckage has been found needs to be further verified before we can further confirm if it belonged to MH370. We dispatch a team to investigate on theseissues dispatch a team to investigate on these issues and we hope we can identify it as soon as is of. When the Boeing 777 punished on a routine flight it prompted the most difficult and expensive search in air transport history. Over some of the world’s remote seas. With no wreckage, until now no one has been sure where to look. And that challenge remains, even if we do now have a first real clue. jonathan Head, BBC News, Kuala Lumpur. Flight MH-37O is the only Boeing triple-7 aircraft ever to have disappeared over an ocean - and the piece of wreckage is thought to be from such a plane. The fragment is now being sent to Toulouse in France for investigation. Our Transport Correspondent Richard Westcott ta kes a look now at what it may reveal. They spent months searching one side of the Indian ocean, but the first clue might have just turned up thousands of miles away, on the other side. They think they might have found one of these, called a flapper-on. If you have ever looked at the wing out of a window, you will have seen one moving around. Investigators might already know if the wreckage Is from the right kind of aircraft. Malaysian 370 was a Boeing 777 and different plane models have different shaped wing plots. The flapper-on sits here, one on either side. Here is the remote French island where volunteers cleaning a beach stumbled over their daybreak. beach stumbled over their daybrea k. It beach stumbled over their daybreak. It is more than 2500 miles from the main search area, where even now boats are combing the sea bed for wreckage. Looking at that gap you might see searchers are wasting their time, might see searchers are wasting theirtime, but their time, but look at the direction of the Seas’s currents. Incredibly finding a piece of wing way over here could prove they are looking in the right place. These barnacles indicate the debris has been floating for at least a year. This is the area that was the focus of the original search. One expert says the promote beaches on the other side of the ocean are exactly where clues would wash up. The currents will have taken any material to the north initially and then across the equatorial current, towards Madagascar. So the timing, the location fits in exactly with what we would expect, given the search site. You get cratering, micro-pitting... Tony cable used to investigate plane crashes. He worked on Lockerbie, so what can experts possibly learn from a 6-foot piece of wing customer the positive confirmation would come from the part numbers which each of the individual parts should have. If it is identified as triple seven it is almost certainly MH370, because I believe there have never been any 777 losses at sea before or losses of large pieces of control surface. Evenif of large pieces of control surface. Even if they have found part of the Malaysian plane the bulk of the aircraft, including the critical black box recorders is still thought hidden beneath the waves. Only when thatis hidden beneath the waves. Only when that is found will we find out why the flight disappeared. Richard Westcott, BBC News. After a third night of large-scale attempts by migrants in Calais to cross the Channel Tunnel illegally, the Prime Minister has sparked controversy by describing them as a ""swarm"". The Refugee Council said David Cameron’s language was ""inflammatory"" and ""dehumanising. "" Downing Street said the Prime Minister was simply pointing out that tens of thousands of people were seeking to enter Europe from Africa. Our Correspondent Lucy Williamson reports from Calais. It may not look like it, but there is a system here. Groups of migrants are breaking through Calais’s defences using Watchman, wire cutters and force of numbers. More than 100 extra police have been brought in to help keep control, but for many the lure of the UK border is stronger. TRANSLATION: When there are 50 or 100 of them tried to get onto a truck and that are ten of us, what can we do? of course a couple make it through. We cannot resolve the situation here any more. Ourjob isjust to manage it. Sometimes a couple make it through, sometimes more. A dozen migrants were arrested after appearing from the back of this Slovenian truck as it arrived in Kent. The Prime Minister said today the UK would not become a safe haven for migrants, but said the situation was part of a wider, global problem. We have a swarm of people coming across the Mediterranean, seeking a better life, wanting to come to Britain because Britain has jobs, life, wanting to come to Britain because Britain hasjobs, a growing economy, it is an incredible place to live. As queues blocked part of the motorway towards Calais, pressure was growing today over the Prime Minister’sdescription of migrants as a swarm. He should remember he is talking about people, not insects. I think it is a very worrying term that he appears to want to be divisive and set people against the migrants in Calais, when what he should have been doing and doing months ago, and was warned to be doing, is to get the situation sorted out with the French. In daylight defences Nir Biton or are probed again. This time by police and engineers. Noting the calling cards of migrants on their nightly rounds, but the repairs are getting tougher and the migrants better equipped. It takes more than enthusiasm to cut a hole like this. Some parts of this fence has been patched up several times already. One of the repair men responsible for this part said the migrants now have heavy duty wire cutters and that one of them passed by as he was repairing a hole and said, why are you bothering, Iwill only repairing a hole and said, why are you bothering, I will only cut it open again tonight. How many of these migrants came back to Calais last night? There are several more fences to breach. Waiting on the other side are for some, friends and family, for othersjust a language they know and life they have been dreaming of. Lucy Williams, BBC, Calais. Let’s speak to our Political Correspondent Ross Hawkins, who’s in Westminster. Ross, how embarrassing is this for Mr Cameron? Describing the migrants as a swarm, how embarrassing are they? He stands accused today of dehumanising the most desperate people. By his opponents. But Downing Street stressed, listen to the rest of his comments, that he was talking about people looking for a better life. He will be and he has beenjudged by his words but he will also be judged by the state of border security, the state of the M25 stop the great hope in Westminster this evening is what we have seen, last-ditch attempts by migrants who have seen a tougher big offence going up and are trying to make the most of what opportunity remains. But they cannot be certain that this is going to get better very quickly here in Westminster. One thing we can be fairly sure of as the Prime Minister returns from his tour of Asia is this looks highly likely to be oppressing and unresolved problem by the time he gets home. Thank you.

The inquiry into the death of the former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko has been told the Metropolitan Police believes the Russian State was involved in his murder. The Met’s barrister said Russia had ""reasons aplenty"" for wishing him ""not only harm, but death"". Mr Litvinenko died in London in 2006 after drinking tea laced with radioactive polonium. The BBC understands that the Metropolitan Police have started an investigation into a number of allegations of crime involving the children’s charity Kid’s Company. Lucy Manning joins us now. What do we know? We know the Metropolitan Police are looking at an investigation involving Kid’s Company. They are looking at a number of allegations of crime to do with the charity. It is being led by officers from the Metropolitan Police from the child exportation command. They are asking anyone who might have information to either contact the Metropolitan Police or an NSPCC helpline that has been set up. The charity is run by the charismatic figurehead and has undoubtedly helped many vulnerable young people over the years. It was caught up in some controversy earlier this month about questions over how it was run and whether the government should continue to give it quite significant funding. In a statement Kid’s Company says it is not hardly aware of the nature of any allegations, that it has robust policies to make sure young people and children are protected and any allegations of misconduct between employees and clients are immediately reported to the police. Many thanks. A teenager has been found guilty of plotting the mass murder of students at Newcastle College. Liam Lyburd, who’s 19, had stockpiled an arsenal of weapons in his bedroom, including pipe bombs, other explosive devices, and a handgun. Danny Savage D8I’II’Iy Savage i’I8S ITIOFE Danny Savage has more details. An arsenal of weapons gathered by a teenager to commit mass murder. It includes guns, bullets and nail bombs. The prosecution said Liam Lyburd was all dressed up with somewhere to go. The 19-year-old admitted gathering the illegal haul, but claimed he never intended to use it. But a jury didn’t believe him. This was his target, his former college. He had been kicked out for bad behaviour and wanted revenge. He had written on his computer: Lyburd claimed the college had ruined his life and wrote ""Don’t expect me to show any mercy"". He said people here had made him look like a fool and said they were responsible for what he described as his miserable existence. More than 100 people were evacuated from homes when a tip-off led police to the weapons. We knew he wasn’t right. He hated the whole world, for no reason. One neighbour told me how blatant Lyburd’s behaviour was. He was basically sitting in his room, plotting to kill people because he didn’t like his life. Simple as that? Simple as that. He stayed in the house, not wanting friends. Loads of the kids around here, when we were younger, were all trying to be his friend but he just didn’t want to come out of the house. Liam Lyburd lived his life online in his bedroom. He said buying weapons was easy, but his virtual life was about to spill over into deadly reality. Danny Savage, BBC News, Newcastle.

It’s over a month since 38 people, 30 of them British, were massacred in the Tunisian resort of Sousse. Tonight’s Panorama programme has pieced together what happened using footage captured by Tunisian eyewitnesses. It examines speculation that a second gunman may have been involved and whether several warnings were ignored that could have saved lives. jane Corbin reports. VOICES SHOUT. Mobile phone footage shows the chaos as Seifeddine Rezgui went on his murderous rampage at the Imperial Hotel. It was more than 28 minutes into his attack before the gunman faced armed opposition. But it was not from Tunisian police. These tourism workers say that an armed policeman arrived on the scene within 12 minutes, but they say that extraordinarily, the policeman refused to take on Rezgui as he had no bullet-proof vest. TRANSLATION: Someone said to the policeman, ""I’ve got army training, I can go inside with you if you’re afraid"". The policeman refused. People surrounded him and he tried to get away, but the lad with the army training took the gun and went into the hotel grounds. The local man, wearing only red shorts, took the policeman’s rifle and confronted the killer. He fired the first bullet and then the second one. Both hit a palm tree. After that, the gun jammed. The terrorist at that moment had a grenade in his hand, and threw it. The incident was filmed by a Tunisian eyewitness. First, the gunshots from the young man in red shorts. Then the grenade is thrown in his direction by Rezgui. His weapon now useless, the man in red shorts was forced to flee. Immediately after the attack, there were reports that tourists had seen a man in red shorts with a gun. It gave rise to the theory that there was a second killer. But the video, together with eyewitnesses, leave little doubt that the so-called second gunman was in fact the Tunisian in red shorts. Eventually, Rezgui was shot dead by police, but by then, he had killed 38 people, 30 of them British, and wounded dozens more. The Tunisian government insists the killer wasn’t known to their security services. But we’ve discovered that 18 months ago, the house where Rezgui lived with other young men was raided. The incident was witnessed by neighbours. TRANSLATION: At that time, the authorities were conducting a campaign against these people, Salafists and otherjihadists. They carried out a surprise raid and searched his house. But it was during the holidays, and they were away. The police didn’t find anything. Rezgui and his friends never came back. They moved to another part of town. We asked the Tunisian government about the raid and the police response to the beach attack. We received no answer. The question remains - had the authorities acted differently, might there have been another outcome? jane Corbin, BBC News, Sousse. You can see more on that story on the BBC’s Panorama programme, Terror on The Beach, tonight on BBC one at 9 o’clock. The owner of British Gas, Centrica, is cutting 6,000 jobs, 5,000 of them in the UK, as part ofa major restructuring of its business. It comes after British Gas announced that profits had doubled to £528 million in the first half of the year. Our business correspondent john Moylan has more. David and Carolyn have been British Gas customers for years. They keep a close eye on how much energy they use, and they’re disappointed that the company hasn’t passed on bigger price cuts, given its bumper profits. It’s always galling when you hear of these large percentage increases by British Gas and the profits they’ve made. They’re not passing it down to the customer. There’s still further room for manoeuvre. In the six months to june, operating profits at British Gas hit £528 million. That was up a whopping 99%. But profits at Centrica fell slightly to £1 billion, hit by lower oil prices, and it’s shedding 6,000 jobs in a major shakeup of the business. Centrica’s chief executive, Iain Conn, told me that the aim is to cut costs and drive efficiency, but 10% of the workforce will go. In order to compete effectively for our customers and ultimately to be able to grow, we’ve got to be as efficient as possible. In the near term, through that efficiency, we are having to face the reality of a reduction of 6,000 jobs, which is a very difficult thing to do. I don’t take this lightly at all. British Gas is by far the biggest residential energy supplier. It says that up to 9 million households rely upon it for their energy needs, and now it’s going to refocus on that huge customer base. So there will be more of this. Mum! 'But if your boiler does break down, it’s good to know...' Selling anything from boiler protection to high-tech thermostats to help customers control their bills. They’ve got 26 million customers in the UK and North America. They’re not really exploiting those relationships efficiently at the moment. If they can do that, they could see profits per customer rise by 30% if they get it right, but that is a big if. But it will pull back on offshore investment, like this huge project underway in the North Sea. That may make sense with oil prices so low, but it could leave Centrica exposed in years to come. john Moylan, BBC News.

Cricket, and England have victory in their sights on just the second day of the third Ashes test in Birmingham. They’re ending the day trying to bowl Australia out for a second time in the match. Our sports correspondent joe Wilson joins us now from Edgbaston. Still 114 miles of navigable canal in Birmingham, says the city council. If you want progress sedate and steady, it’s where to head. Test matches were once like that, remember? Mitchelljohnson? Well, he’s quick. Watch out. Bairstow gone for five. How do you play that? Well, Ben Stokes couldn’t answer. Off gloves to wicketkeeper, two wickets and johnson’s first over. England were trying to build a lead. joe Root resisted with yet another important innings. 63, he made, but England needed more. 59 from Moeen Ali. With Moeen Ali’s contribution, England built up a first-innings lead of 145, really useful. And now they would bowl again. Australia’s second innings, Stuart Broad to Chris Rogers, yes, that’s out, LBW. Now, simply the tension of watching. Steve Smithjust had time to ponder the rashness of his shot before the ball dropped into Buttler’s gloves, 62-2. David Warner was not here to meander. Infact, he was playing an utterly different game, but who would stay with him? Not the captain, Clarke gone for three, caught by Lyth brilliantly. And not Voges, gone first ball. Finn on fire. Mitchell Marsh? That’s five down. With Warner, Australia had a glimmer. Without him, where was hope? 77, and sunk. Here is the situation. Australia are still batting. They have just gone into the lead. Let’s presume tomorrow, there was that England a double to chase. Anderson hasjust gone off with injury, worrying for England, but they should win this test match tomorrow. Should! I predicting anything. -- I am test match tomorrow. Should!

More than a million designed for grown-ups have been sold in the UK in the past year, and they make up four of Amazon’s top ten bestsellers. Sarah Campbell asks why. In her bedroom studio, Millie Marotta hasjust begun work on her third colouring book. Her intricate designs have become hugely popular, topping bestseller lists. It wasn’t long after the first book had been published that I realised, you know, it was becoming a thing and people were really tapping into it and it was becoming more and more popular. But back at the beginning, I didn’t expect this at all. It was a real surprise. These enthusiasts from south Wales met via one of Facebook’s adult colouring groups, and now regularly get together to share books, pens and colouring tips. Everywhere you go, it’s taking off. It’s brilliant. What a lovely thing in this day and age, when everybody’s into their computers and all the tech stuff, to be able to come back to basics and do something like this, which is fabulous. I can just switch off. People can talk to me for ten minutes and I won’t even know they’re talking to me. just in a world of my own, peaceful. Yeah, no worries, just happily colouring away. Colouring in used to be seen as a children’s activity, but not any more. And for book-sellers competing against the rise in electronic readers, that’s got to be a good thing, because colouring in can only be done the old-fashioned way. It’s definitely not a flash in the pan. The number of books which are available will double in the next six months. Will it last for ever? There’s no way of telling, but it will be around for a good while. Millie describes her work as a collaboration, because her final artworks are joint efforts between her and her fans. Together, they’re creating a publishing phenomenon that shows no signs of fading. Sarah Campbell, BBC News. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Louise Lear. Yesterday, we started with all the excitement at Edgbaston. Today, is the beauty of Loch Lomond, a glorious afternoon in south-west Scotland. Hope you manage to make the most of it, because for the golf dust down the road in Turnberry, it looks as if it is all change for tomorrow, clouding over with long spells of rain in the afternoon. Why? An area of low pressure is moving in as we speak, bringing in wind and showery rain overnight. Temperatures will fall away sharply in rural spots. A chilly start to the morning, with low single figures in a few places. Chilly, but sunny, and it will be a glorious day across much of central and southern England. With a southerly wind, it will feel noticeably better out there, which will come as welcome news. We could have high teens south-west England, maybe as high as 22 in the south-east. A few showers in north Wales and the north-west of England, stretching into Northern Ireland and western Scotland, those showers merging together for longer spells of rain. Not too bad in eastern Scotland. For the start of Saturday, we keep the threat of showers to the extreme north of Scotland. There is a band of nuisance cloud, maybe a spot of rain moving through England and Wales, but the warming trend continues. Temperatures in the high teens in southern Scotland, maybe as high as 23 degrees in the south-east. It looks as though this theme continues for the early half of August, with low-pressure anchored to the north-west. So more unsettled conditions here, but for central and southern England, we continue to pourin southern England, we continue to pour in that warm air from the near continent. Here, temperatures will look witty promising. Enjoy. A reminder now of our main story. The first major clue into the fate of the missing Malaysia Airlines flight. A piece of plane wreckage washes ashore on a remote island in the Indian ocean. That’s all from the BBC News at Six.

The soulful South London singer Lianne La Havas on her latest album and why her home town inspires her. Welcome to BBC London News. First tonight. The health regulator has stepped in at a top London hospital which has declared that it’s tens of millions of pounds in the red. The organisation Monitor says it’s taking action after a sudden deterioration in finances at St George’s University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. As our Health Correspondent Karl Mercer reports, It’s not the only South London Health Trust facing troubled times. On the front line it is business as usual at St Georges. But as the business of treating patients rumbles on the business of balancing the books is getting a lot harder. This hospital was £20 million in debt last year and it is predicting ",,
114,BBC1 London,30-jul-2015,BBC News at Ten,22:00,25 mins,True,"Tonight at Ten, David Cameron is coming under increasing pressure to do more to tackle the migrant crisis in Calais. He blames the problems in France on ""a swarm"" of migrants crossing the Mediterranean. His choice of words has been criticised by refugee groups. Some have reached the UK, with police in Kent detaining a number of migrants found in a lorry. We will remove more illegal migrants from our country, so people know it is not a safe haven when they get there. Also tonight: Could this be part of the missing Malaysia Airlines plane MH 370, that disappeared last year. Investigaters are examining wreckage found in the Indian Ocean. A teenager has been found guilty of plotting the mass murder of students, at Newcastle College, after an array of weapons was discovered in his room. Data form the Philae Lander suggest comets may have laid the seeds for life on earth. And England pile the pressure on Australia at Edgbaston, in the Third Ashes Test. On BBC London: A capital leading hospital is to call on outsiders to help it get out of debt. And the police watchdogs investigate the actions of officers after a teenager’s death. Good evening. David Cameron has been widely condemned for describing migrants in Calais trying to reach Britain as a ""swarm"". The charity, the Refugee Council, condemned the language as ""irresponsible"" and ""dehumanising,"" while Labour said his choice of words was ""inflammatory"". Downing Street rejected the criticism saying the Prime Minister also referred to the migrants as ""people seeking a better life"". Well the latest figures show the number of those entering Europe across the Mediterranean this year, has now passed 180,000. It’s estimated there are currently 3000 migrants in the camp at Calais, though some credible sources claim there could be three times that number in the area. Our Correspondent Lucy Williamson is in Calais for us tonight. Well, we have just been down to the perimeter fence that runs along the railway in Calais and seen a group of Ao or 50 migrants slip under the fencing and walk off towards the tunnel entrance. Eurotunnel says that there has been a drop last night in the number of incursions, compared to Monday or Tuesday but all of the signs are that the new challenges of this week: Bigger groups of migrants, better organised, they are becoming Calais’s new routine. It may not look like it, but there is a system here. Groups of migrants are breaking through Calais’ defences using watchmen, wire cutters and force of numbers. More than 100 extra police have been brought in to help keep control, but the lure of the UK is stronger. A family reunion. An El Dorado, orjust a place where they can speak the language. If it’s carried them across continents, fences like these aren’t going to stop them. Mohamed arrived here from Syria three weeks ago, leaving his wife and newborn baby behind. A dentist caught between the Islamic State and the Syrian army. He has nothing against the French, he says, but doesn’t want to settle here. Our language, English. Our hope, to go to England. We will stay here and we will try, try, try again and again and again. And then we will go to England. Where there is a will, there is a way. Today in Kent, more evidence that some at least are getting through. A dozen migrants found in the back of this Slovenian truck. One by one, wrapped in tinfoil blankets, they are taken away by police. The Prime Minister has said the UK will not become a safe haven for Calais’ migrants and that the situation there was part of a global problem. You’ve got a swarm of people coming across the Mediterranean, seeking a better life, wanting to come to Britain because Britain has got jobs, it’s got a growing economy, it’s an incredible place to live. With 6,000 lorries now parked on the motorway in Kent, anger is growing, but there was criticism of Mr Cameron for describing the migrants as a swarm. He should remember he’s talking about people, not insects. I think it’s a very worrying turn that he appears to be wanting to be divisive and set people against... Whip people up against the migrants in Calais. What he should have been doing, and should have been doing months ago, and was warned to be doing, is to get the situation sorted out with the French. It’s not even sundown here and this road is turning into a migration highway. Hundreds of people, men and women, are making theirway, step-by-step, towards the tunnel entrance. Some of them will make this journey several times tonight. How many of them will still be in Calais tomorrow? The Prime Minister’s choice of words has provoked debate. Ross Hawkins is here. He said they sought a better life, but David Cameron was accused of dehumanising desperate people today after he described migrants crossing the Mediterranean as a ""swarm"". The Prime Minister- who’s been touring the Far East - was criticised by the United Nation’s Special Representative he said the language he’d used was ""unfortunate"" and the debate in Britain was misleading. It is worrying that there are enormous numbers of people trying to get in, and that the UK is somehow alone is this, though, is not true. Everybody is in the same situation. So how much of the burden does Britain bear? Last year over applications for asylum were made in 600,000 European Union. Of those the a third were made in Germany. One in ten were in France. Around over five percent were in the UK. Of course many asylum applications are refused, and we can’t know exactly how many people simply came or stayed illegally. Today the Conservative MP David Davies said camps should be established across North Africa and the Middle East to accommodate expelled illegal migrants. If they cannot be sent back to their own country, they should be house in countries nearby, so that when the situation in their country improves they can have a smooth transition back home. Across Europe, governments - the British included - strive to target people traffickers, and would dearly like to see the conflict in Syria come to an end. But no politician, whatever language is used, pretends the pressures driving migrants to this continent are about to ease any time soon. 16 months after Flight MH-370 disappeared without trace, investigators are examining a fragment of wreckage that may have come from the plane, washed up on an island in the Indian Ocean. The Malaysian Airlines jet left Kuala Lumpur bound for Beijing, with 239 people on board. It was last detected on radar heading west over the Strait of Malacca, having veered off its original course. Now, possible debris has been discovered thousands of miles away,on the remote island of Reunion, from where Milton Nkosi reports. It isn’t much. A piece of a wing, less than three metres long, endiscussed with barnacles. And here the tattered remains of a suitcase. Yet more than 500 days after the disappearance the flight, these may be the first clues to one of the great aviation mysteries. TRANSLATION: It was very windy. Me and my friends decided to pull the debris further on to the shore. Then Ifound a bit debris further on to the shore. Then I found a bit of suitcase over there on the stones. I don’t know if it was a suitcase that came from the plane but it was opposite the plane debris. For the families, waiting so long for news, emotions today are mixed. I have been waiting for 509 days to see hi husband, Chong Ling again. So I selfishly hope it is not from the flight, MH 370. Yet, I have not had the grief and the other part of me is trying to have a closure but it is a mixed feeling at the moment. It is the baffling absence of any physical evidence of flight MH 370 that has given rise to a bewildering range of theories about what may have happened to it. If this chunk of a wing that has been found turns out to be from the missing airliner, the theories will be narrowed down to the one thought most likely, that the plane ended under the waves of the Southern Ocean. The debris has been taken to the remote island ah to France for identification. Until then, the officials are cautious about drawing conclusions. Whatever wreckage is found needs to be further verified before we can confirm whether it belongs to MH 370. So we have sent a team to investigate on this issue. We hope that we can identify its as soon as possible. When the Boeing triple-7 vanished on a routine flight, it prompted the most difficult and expensive search in air transport history, over the most remote seas, with no wreckage no-one has been sure where to look. That challenge remains, even if we do now have a first real clue. Flight MH-370 is the only Boeing triple-7 aircraft ever to have disappeared over open water, and the piece of wreckage discovered in the Indian Ocean is thought to be from a triple-7jet. The fragment will be sent to Toulouse in France for analysis. Here’s our Transport Correspondent Richard Westcott. They’ve spent months searching one side of the Indian Ocean, but the first clue might just have turned up thousands of miles away, on the other side. They think they’ve found one of these, called a flaperon. If you’ve ever looked at the wing out of a window, you’ll have seen one moving around. Investigators might already know if the wreckage is from the right kind of aircraft. Malaysia 370 was a Boeing 777, but different models have different-shaped wing parts. The flaperons sit here, one on either side. And here is the remote French island where volunteers cleaning a beach stumbled over the debris. It’s more than 2,500 miles from the main search area, where even now, boats are combing the sea bed for the wreckage. Looking at that gap, you might think searchers are wasting their time, but look at the direction of the sea’s currents. Incredibly, finding a piece of wing way over here could prove they are looking in the right place. These barnacles indicate the debris has been floating for at least a year. One expert says the remote beaches on the other side of the ocean are exactly where clues would wash up. The currents will have taken any material to the north initially and then across the equatorial current towards Madagascar. So the timing, the location, fits in exactly with what we’d expect, given the search site. Tony Cable used to investigate plane crashes. He worked on Lockerbie. So what can experts possibly learn from a six-foot piece of wing? The positive confirmation will come from the part numbers, which each of the individual parts making it up should have. If it’s identified as 777, it’s almost certainly MH370 it’s almost certainly MH 370 been any 777s lost at sea before. Even if they have found part of the Malaysian plane, the bulk of the aircraft, including the critical black box recorders, is still thought hidden beneath the waves. Only when that’s found will we know why the flight disappeared. Two more trade unions are backing the left-wing MPjeremy Corbyn in the Labour leadership contest. The transport union, the TSSA, and the Communications Workers Union, will recommend their members vote for him. Mr Corbyn already has the support of the UK’s two biggest unions, Unite and Unison. The energy firm Centrica, which owns British Gas, is to cut 6,000 jobs, as part of a major restructuring programme. The company wants to reduce costs, focusing on its residential business, instead of energy exploration. It comes as British Gas announced profits had nearly doubled to £528 million in the first half of the year. The BBC understands that the Metropolitan Police has started an investigation into a number of allegations of crime involving the children’s charity, Kids Company. Our special correspondent, Lucy Manning, reports. It’s a charity that’s helped many vulnerable young people, but now Kids Company is at the centre of a police investigation. The BBC understands a team from the sexual offences, exploitation and child abuse command is looking into a number of allegations believed to be claims that serious incidents were reported to the police or authorities. jaszczu k were jaszczuk were not reported. The charity, run by the high-profile Camilla Batmanghelidjh, had already faced questions about the way it was run and its funding. She agreed earlier this month that she would step aside, but denied the charity was mismanaged. But allegations made to BBC journalists are believed to have triggered this police investigation and the leader of the council which covers the charity told BBC’s Newsnight this was the right step. It’s the duty of local councils and indeed the police to investigate any allegation where young people may have been abused. I think the public would expect nothing less. In a statement, the charity said... Kids Company has been seen as a success story and there’s no doubt there are many troubled young people at its various sites and they have been supported, but the police are now asking anyone with any information or concerns to contact them or the NSPCC. It’s one of Britain’s most well-known charities, but now finds itself facing what may be some difficult allegations. It made a spectacular landing on a comet late last year, and now it’s emerged the Philae lander may have made a significant discovery. Scientists analysing data it’s collected have found complex chemical compounds described as a ""frozen primoridal soup."" They support the theory that comets may have provided the ingredients for life on earth. Here’s our science editor, David Shukman. Descending towards the uncharted territory of a comet hurtling through deep space was one of the greatest achievements in exploration and when it happened last November, the surface looked utterly barren. But in fact, the rock and dust have turned out to be a rich and varied mix of different chemicals. Some of them expected, some not. The chief scientist for one of the instruments on the lander is Ian Wright and he told me how it had found the sort of ingredients that could be useful for getting life going. I see this cometary material that we’re analysing as frozen primordial soup. It’s the kind of stuff that if you had it and you warmed it up somehow and put it in the right environment, with the right conditions, you may eventually get life forming out of it. The mission is trying to answer the big question of whether comets helped to kick-start life on the early Earth. So what’s it found? Well, let’s imagine we’ve got the surface of the comet right here in our studio. And here comes the Philae lander, descending as it did last November. Instruments on-board the spacecraft started gathering a wealth of data. Only now are scientists publishing the results. No surprise, they did not find any signs of life itself. They never expected to. But they have discovered the kind of chemicals which can make the building blocks for life. So, first, there’s water- lots of it- in the form of ice, together with oxygen and carbon dioxide. Nothing remarkable, but important. Then there are more complex compounds, such as hydroxyethanol, which can play a role in the formation of sugars. And polyoxyethylene, which could, through a series of processes, lead to the backbone of DNA. So where does this leave us? We still don’t know for sure if comets brought life to earth, but it looks very plausible that they may have helped to get it going. Finding simple organic compounds on a comet out there in space, showing us these could have been delivered to the Earth early in the history of our planet, is tremendously exciting. It gives us better ideas about how those building blocks of life may have been formed and where they may have come from. The lander, Philae, is in itself a bad way. This is how it was meant to touch down. Infact, it landed in a hole, surrounded by boulders, which might explain why it can’t communicate. But already it’s delivered new insights into this distant world and revealed how comets aren’t quite as alien as they look, but in fact might have a direct connection with us. A teenager has been found guilty of plotting the mass murder of students at Newcastle College. Liam Lyburd, who’s 19, had stockpiled an arsenal of weapons in his bedroom, including pipe bombs and a handgun. D8I’II’Iy Savage i’I8S ITIOFE. An arsenal of weapons gathered by a teenager to commit mass murder. It includes guns, bullets and nail bombs. The prosecution said Liam Lyburd was all dressed up with somewhere to go. The 19-year-old admitted gathering the illegal haul, but claimed he never intended to use it. But a jury didn’t believe him. This was his target - his former college. He’d been kicked out for bad behaviour and wanted revenge. He’d written on his computer: Lyburd claimed the college had ruined his life and wrote, ""Don’t expect me to show any mercy"". He said people here had made him look like a fool and said they were responsible for what he described as his miserable existence. More than 100 people were evacuated from homes when a tip-off led police to the weapons. Sitting around him, you knew he wasn’t right. He hated the whole world, for no reason. One neighbour told me how blatant Lyburd’s behaviour was. He was basically sitting in his room, plotting to kill people because he didn’t like his life. Simple as that? Simple as that. He stayed in the house, not wanting friends. Loads of the kids around here, when we were younger, were all trying to be his friend, but he just didn’t want to come out of the house. Liam Lyburd lived his life online in his bedroom. He said buying weapons was easy, but his virtual life was about to spill over into deadly reality. The inquiry into the death of the former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko has been told the Metropolitan Police believes the Russian State was involved in his murder. He died in London in 2006, after drinking tea laced with radioactive polonium. The inquiry is due to end tomorrow. The former hosts of Top Gear, jeremy Clarkson, james May and Richard Hammond, have signed a deal to present a motoring show on the television streaming service, Amazon Prime. The first in the three-series deal will be broadcast next year. just a week ago, renowned Chinese artist and outspoken activist Ai Weiwei had his passport returned to him from the Chinese authorities, having confiscated it for almost four years. But today it was the British government that refused the artist a six-month visa to Britain after failing to declare a criminal conviction on his application form. He’ll be due to leave the countryjust days before China’s President, Xi jinping, begins a state visit to the UK. Our home editor, Mark Easton, reports. just as China gives the dissident artist Ai Weiwei permission to travel overseas for the first time in four years, today reunited with his wife and son in Germany, the UK turns down his application for a six-month business visa. I just want to see my son, I haven’t seen him for a year. Ai Weiwei posted the Home Office rejection letter on his Instagram account, an immigration official in Beijing tells him: Ai Weiwei denies he’s ever been convicted of any offence in China and his supporters say he is disappointed that access to the UK is restricted tojust 20 days. This is yet another barrier for him. But he is now in Germany, he’s started to travel for the first time so hopefully his mood may change. He may feel the world is accepting him again rather than denying him. The artist, best known for his sunflower seed installation in the Tate Modern, and his design for the Bird’s Nest Olympic Stadium in Beijing, will be in Britain for the opening of a major three-month long exhibition at the Royal Academy in London. But the gallery’s chief executive says the visa incident has cast a shadow over the event. It’s unspeakably unfortunate that immediately that the Chinese authorities liberalise, the British authorities look as if they’ve behaved in a way which is unnecessarily bureaucratic. In October, with full ceremony, the president of China will be driven down the Mall to stay with the Queen at Buckingham Palace. One of his most outspoken critics, Ai Weiwei, will not be in the country. His visa runs out just a few days before. The Home Office refused to answer questions about the visa today, saying only that Ai Weiwei will be able to come to Britain for dates he originally requested. But human rights campaigners say the episode sends out the wrong message. Ai Weiwei should have that visa, he should be here when the President arrives and our own Prime Minister should be the one who’s making the statements when that visit happens about the human rights record in China. Ai Weiwei’s supporters assume the affair is more about confusion than conspiracy and remain hopeful the Home Office will reconsider the welcome Britain gives China’s most celebrated living artist.

The ongoing migrant crisis in Calais - a man is killed as for the second night running hundreds of migrants try to enter the Channel Tunnel. An estimated 1500 people attempted to cross into the UK on lorries or trains last night - the government comes under pressure to do more. It’s about working with the French, putting in place these additional security measures, adding in the investment where that’s needed and Britain will always come forward with that. Here - the knock-on effect in Kent- sections of the motorway become a giant lorry park - with local roads left to cope. We’ll be live with our correspondents in Kent and Calais. Also this lunchtime.

Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. A man has been killed in Calais as around 1,500 migrants tried to enter the Channel Tunnel last night to cross into the UK. French police said the Sudanese man was probably crushed by a truck - he’s the ninth person to die since june. Eurotunnel says the migrants’ attempts to board lorries and trains are now ""an almost nightly occurrence"". The Home Secretary Theresa May has been chairing the government’s emergency Cobra committee to discuss the ongoing crisis. In a moment we’ll be hearing from our correspondents in Westminster and in Calais, but first let’s go to Kent- where sections of the M20 are closed to allow extra lorry parking, and where we canjoin Robert Hall. The scenes are depressingly familiar notjust in Kent but to those The scenes are depressingly familiar not just in Kent but to those who have been following the story around the UK. Long lines of lorries queueing up, leaving the 20 just south of Maidstone and joining a holding area still many miles north of both the Channel Tunnel and Channel ports. On their radios today these drivers are hearing news of another tragedy in Calais and more disruption ahead. As dusk fell, the figures in the shadows began to move once again. Desperate travellers seeking any opportunity to breach the defences at Coquelles before new security measures are put in place. There would taking them across roads, through cut fences and onto the tracks leading to the tunnel. French police said that a Sudanese man in his 20s was killed after being hit by moving lorry. After the second major incident in A8 hours, Eurotunnel used social media to spread the news that cross-channel traffic faced another day of disruption. On the 20 motorway which is served as a waiting area for tens of thousands of lorries over the past two months, Kent police were forced to close the northbound carriageway as the southbound which capacity. And more traffic was diverted onto country roads. In local communities and businesses, their patience is wearing thin. Last night was another tragedy, 1500 migrants trying to break in and against someone being killed. How many more people are going to be killed before the French authorities had equipped of the problem and make sure the entrance to the tunnel is secured. The crisis gripping ports in Kent and the North of France led to talks yesterday between the Home Secretary and her French counterpart. UK pledged an extra £7 million towards beefing up security at the Calais and of the tunnel. Today is the government COBRA committee reviewed the overnight developments, the Prime Minister reemphasised that joint approach between the UK and France. We are working closely with the French. The Home Secretary met yesterday with the French interior minister. We invested money in fencing around Calais and we are also putting fencing around the entrance to the tunnel at Coquelles. We are doing everything we can. In the queues, drivers now resigned to a journey that may have doubled in length. Often putting their cargo at risk. Sean Swann called to tell us how police had answered his appeal for help. I spoke to Kent police and make them aware that my driver was about to exceed 15 hours. They said because of the current situation it would not be enforced. They arranged for a police escort. This did get me to Dover but instead of being a 15 hour day, it had become a 23 hour day. In mY day, it had become a 23 hour day. In my opinion that is extremely dangerous. I was so tired but I felt drunk. Overthe dangerous. I was so tired but I felt drunk. Over the next few days high security fencing normally used to protect vulnerable sites in the UK will be erected alongside the approaches to the Channel Tunnel. The priority is to protect the platforms were migrants can reach trains and vehicles before they move into the tunnel. But the camps in and around Calais are still growing and a long-term solution to this crisis remains elusive. There’s no doubt that things have stepped up notch. We have more motorway closed on this side of the water. On the French side a bigger offensive, more barbed wire and police. Your eternal security staff out in force. But it is all about managing the situation. Itjust takes one migrant to reach the tracks and everything grinds to a halt again. Our correspondent Peter Whittlesea is in Calais for us. Peter- more than 2,000 people tried to get in to the Channel Tunnel on Monday night, another 1,500 last night. Paint the picture for us of what it is like there? Well security has been breached for a second night. Hundreds of migrants have gone through here. We watched last night as they walked along the tracks. Around one third the mile from the freight depot. They were walking along tracks to try to get to the platforms. One of the routes they were taking was along this motorway bridge, down the steps they are and crossing over the road. You can see why this fence, if Ijust lift it up, if you come along you can see that there is a hole in the fence. But have been made but obviously it is easy to pull those apart. No wonder with security like this, this is why the Home Secretary has pledged to spend £7 million increasing the amount of security here. And blocking up these holes. Eurotunnel says the situation for them is overwhelming but they do say they have spent more than 150 million euros in the past ten years on security. They also said their own security teams have intercepted 37,000 migrants since the beginning of this year. They say they have handed those over to the French law enforcement teams but as yet, no one has been prosecuted. Our Assistant Political Editor Norman Smith is at Westminster. £7 million has been pledged from the government. But a lot of pressure on them to do more. Pressure notjust from the hauliers, holiday-makers and businesses, hauliers, holiday-makers and businesses, but from MPs here. And the pressure is for the government to take a much tougher line with the French. There is a widespread suspicion that the French authorities are simply not trying that hard to provide adequate security. It is argued that they are quite relaxed in France about migrants coming to the UK rather than remaining in France. And therefore there have been demands for the French to consider deploying their own army. They have been demands for Mr Cameron to hold direct talks with President Francois Hollande to try to resolve the crisis. The result-- Hollande to try to resolve the crisis. The result -- the response of the government has been to avoid any criticism of the French whatsoever. David Cameron this morning said it was no point in pointing the finger of blame at the French. And this was the response of the Home Secretary Theresa May after she chaired the emergency COBRA meeting this morning. We’re working very constructively with the French government. French government has been putting considerable effort into the issue. More police have been put in the ports and we’re working with the French government on a number of other measures we can take to make sure we are reducing the problem. Ultimately we will deal with this problem by dealing with it at source, ensuring that people are not making the journey in the first place. The reason why ministers are adopting such a softly softly approach with the French is notjust because obviously the security situation is on French soil and will have to be dealt with by French police, but because at the moment there is a critical deal between France and the UK under which UK border checks are carried out in Calais and not in Dover. And the fear in the British Government weighs in against Paris, the French will say there are enough, you sort it out. You carry out those checks in Dover. Draft guidelines on how patients in England should be cared for in their last few days of life have been published today by the health watchdog NICE. The guidance replaces the controversial ""Liverpool Care Pathway"", which was scrapped after a review found some dying patients had been deprived of food and water. Our Health Correspondent Sophie Hutchinson reports. Every year half a million people die in England. Austin Hospital. Other have been serious concerns about the care that they receive. That is not the case for Simon Clayton, a writer and documentary maker, now being treated for advanced throat cancer at St George ‘s Hospital in London. It makes it difficult to speak. Nevertheless he explained what it has meant to have such good care. It gave me the opportunity to make the best of what you have got. And that is fantastic. The new proposals published today by the health watchdog NICE aim to improve care for all adults in the last few days of life. The 32 page document lists recommendations for a more personalised approach, with daily reviews of hydration and medication and stresses the importance of good communication. Doctor said that getting care right does not have to be complicated. It is attention to the present, the detail. To assess how someone is feeling, if they have any particular symptoms. If they are well looked after us that if they had something to eat and drink. The proposals replace the controversial system known as the Liverpool Care Pathway, a check list heavily criticised for being a tick-box a check list heavily criticised for being a tick- box exercise being a tick-box exercise used by inexperienced staff which in the worst cases left patients so dehydrated that they tried to suck water from sponges used to moisten their mouths. This little debate about what makes good end of life care but the big question is how to deliver it and will replacing the old check list with you broader guidelines merely ensure that the needs of the patients are not ignored. One problem with the Liverpool Care Pathway and perhaps why it became a tick-box exercise is that people did not have the training they need it. Again with these guidelines, and they are draft at the moment, we need to make sure that there is contingent-- continuing training. Assessing when a patient is dying can be complex and difficult. The new guidelines aim to help staff identified that and ensure the very best and to people’s lives. Thousands of Britain’s biggest firms will be forced to reveal what they are doing to stop slavery and human trafficking in their supply chains. David Cameron made the commitment ahead of becoming the first British Prime Minister to visit Vietnam, one of the main countries from which people are trafficked into the UK. Ben Wright is travelling with the Prime Minister and joins us from Hanoi. The meetings here in Hanoi is all about business and deal. The UK wants a piece of the action in this booming economy. But before arriving in Vietnam David Cameron had strong words to say about the issues of evil smuggling and trafficking. He said from the autumn, 12,000 UK firms with a turnover of 36 billion pounds a year or more must be more transparent about their supply chains. In countries like Vietnam. They do not have to publish what they are doing, -- they have to publish what they’re doing to make sure they’re not involved in child labour or people trafficking. This is what the Minister said. We are asking big businesses to examine their supply chains and make sure that there is no modern slavery taking part in any part of that supply chain. Many thousands of people are trafficked from criminal gangs from Vietnam to the UK. An estimated 3000 children are employed in cannabis factories and nail bars, in the sex industry in the UK. David Cameron is determined that this needs to stop. There was a new slavery Bill coming into force at the end of the week. Far tougher penalties on people involved in trafficking and more help for those caught up in it to be relocated to where they came from. And more compensation. David Cameron also said we would be doing more on that front, setting up a shelter in Vietnam to help those transported back here to resettle. And more work to be done in the autumn to make sure that this modern slave trade can be stopped. Our top story this lunchtime. The Calais crisis continues - more than 1500 migrants attempt to storm the Channel Tunnel two nights running. Back to the future - why in the printed photo. Later on BBC London, adding a touch of glamour, joanna Lumley wants people to get informed in transforming their communities. The puppet making company behind the warhorse bring their latest creations to life. An American dentist who killed Zimbabwe’s most famous lion says he regrets it - and that he believed he was on a legal hunt. Walter Palmer from Minnesota shot Cecil the lion with a crossbow and rifle just outside Hwange National Park. A local hunter and landowner have appeared in court this morning charged with poaching. Our Africa correspondent Alistair Leithhead reports. This magnificent animal was known as Cecil, a 13-year-old lion who was a well-known and much-loved attraction at the Hwange National Park in Zimbabwe. The animals are protected, but it’s thought Cecil was lured out of the park and then shot by an American hunter who had paid tens of thousands of pounds to local guides. This animal was shot at ten o’clock at night, using a bowhunt - this is a specialised hunt. A bow and arrow, as you know it, in colloquial terms. The man responsible has been making the headlines after being named by conservationists as 55-year-old Walter Palmer, a dentist from Minnesota, USA, and a bow and arrow hunting enthusiast. His surgery was closed, his whereabouts unknown, and vitriol from around the world was targeted at his social media sites, which showed him with previous rare animal trophies. In a statement, he said he deeply regretted killing such a well-known animal, saying: Blaming his guides. Two men - a professional hunter and a local farm owner- have been charged with poaching in relation to the death of Cecil. Barclays Bank has reported a 25% rise in profits, making £3.1 billion in the six months tojune. The bank also set aside another £850 million to compensate customers, including further claims for mis-sold payment protection insurance. The results come less than a month after new chairman john McFarlane sacked chief executive Antonyjenkins. Two of Britain’s most high-profile terrorists have won a landmark legal challenge against their solitary confinement in prison, arguing that the segregation was illegal. Kamel Bourgass and Tanvir Hussain were separated for up to seven months after being accused of being involved in attacks on other prisoners or attempting to dictate their faith. The Supreme court found that the men had been unlawfully segregated because they should have been better informed of the reasons. The leader of the Afghan Taliban, Mullah Omar, has died according to reports from intelligence and government officials. The reclusive leader has not been seen in public since 2001, and it’s thought he may have died about two years ago. Richard Galpin is here. This is still a bit shrouded in mystery - what more can you tell us? It is very much a mystery. As you say, basically very senior government sources have spoken to the BBC, including security forces, saying the low mark is dead, in fact he died two or three years ago. -- saying, it has not been confirmed yet. The key thing is that the Taliban have not said anything. They told the BBC they would make some kind of statement but it has not been made yet. There have been reports before that Mullah Omar is dead but they have not been confirmed. It is a big if, but if he is confirmed to be dead,it if, but if he is confirmed to be dead, it would be a significant moment. He is the centralfigure dead, it would be a significant moment. He is the central figure of the Afghan Taliban, helped to create the movement in the 1990s. There are supposed to be peace talks between the Taliban and the government, but they could be injeopardy the Taliban and the government, but they could be in jeopardy if it is confirmed as dead. The increasing workload on family doctors is putting patient safety at risk, according to the Royal College of GPs. It says complex cases and increased bureaucracy are causing fatigue and burnout, and that practices should be able to send out an alert or ""distress signal"" if they’re struggling to cope. Here’s our Health Correspondent, Adam Brimelow. Come on in, grab a seat. There’s a lot of evidence that the GP’s workload is increasing. More patients, often with complicated conditions, plus all the paperwork. And that’s before you factor in the shift to a seven-day service. If the pressure gets too much for doctors, it can be bad for patients. By the end of a long day, you are getting tired. To recognise that that is the stage, without meaning to, where simple mistakes can be made. Not only have you been using thought processes for a full day, but been looking at a computer screen for ten or 12 hours, that’s very tiring. The Royal College says tired GPs are more likely to make the stakes -- The Royal College says tired GPs are more likely to make mistakes in diagnosis. They may make medication errors or even get their patients mixed up. The college says other workers such as lorry drivers and airline pilots have tough rules to prevent mistakes, and wants the same rules for GPs. It is like being on a hamster wheel. The harder we try to keep up with the demand, the more likely we are to fall into the tired and stressed category that we know is worse in terms of creating a safe environment for patients. One way of easing pressure in a crisis would be to allow GP practices to issue a distress signal. This is something hospitals can do already when they are struggling to cope. It tells other parts of the health system to step in and help in order to protect patient safety. Patients groups, though, say this idea could damage public confidence. People don’t want to go to their GP and then be told this has been closed because it’s not safe and there aren’t enough staff and they are too tired. So actually that needs to be sorted out behind-the-scenes so wherever a patient turns up, they can be guaranteed of getting a good service. Evenif Even if that means being signposted to somebody else. The Department of Health in England and acknowledged GPs were under pI’âSSUI’â. But said it was committed to ensuring there were more staff available for general practice. It said the best way to ease their workload was to get the NHS to focus on prevention rather than cure. The computer giant, Microsoft, has launched the latest version of its Windows operating system, Windows 10. It’s being given to existing users free of charge and, for the first time, will work across all Windows-powered devices. Our Technology Correspondent Rory Cellan-jones takes a look. What’s different about Windows 10? Well, the first thing is, it can look at me and know who I am. I’m in. One familiar thing is back - the start button. Let’s have a look. Yes - it is fair to say that a lot of people were pretty sad about the disappearance of the start button, felt lost in Windows 8? The feedback we got was that people wanted the start button back, and it made sense that we did so! It is working pretty well in 10. Microsoft seems pretty excited by the browser- it is not called Internet Explorer, it is called Edge - what is this about? You canjust draw on the screen, and then share that with someone else, either using mail or social networking orjust save it foI’ yOUIâ OWFI USE. What is really different in Windows 10? Apart from face recognition, how about this? Hey, Cortana - what is the weather going to be like in London tomorrow? The forecast for tomorrow in London shows mostly cloudy skies... People use it on mobile phones already, on Windows phones - do they really want it in a desktop? I think an example of where that really worked well for me - if you ask her something like, ""When I get home, remind me to do something, like put the bins out."" Because there are apps coming to Android and Apple phones as well as on a Windows phone, whichever one you have will buzz when you get home and say, ""Remember to put the bins out."" Windows 8 annoyed a lot of people because it was so directed towards tablet and mobile users, but this one seems very PC orientated - have you gone backwards? If we pull the keyboard off, it effectively becomes a tablet. Windows 10 recognises that and allows me to choose to run in full-screen mode, which has more of a touch feel to it. Once again you are trying to please both communities, the mobile community and the desktop community - can you please them all? I think based on the feedback we have got, people really like this approach. It makes sense to them. I think people are going to like it. Let’s wait and see what they say. Our Technology Correspondent Rory Cellan-jones reporting there. England have made an encouraging start against Australia in Birmingham in what looks like a pivotal third Ashes Test match. This series stands at 1-1, and despite dominating the test, the visitors have struggled this morning. After the morale draining defeat for England at Lord’s it was vital they showed signs of recovery immediately and that has happened with Australia 72-3 at lunch. One way or another for Alastair Cook things so far have gone his way. On the first morning of a Test match, a million things in the mind ever captain, first and foremost the sheer act chance. How will a coin fall and decide the direction of play that follows? Tales, called Australia’s skipper. Tales, eventually, displayed the coin. So, Australia would bat, and that was that. It’s supposed to be an advantage. Didn’t look it when David Warner without LBW for just look it when David Warner without LBW forjust two. Fine start james Anderson. This might be a good morning for bowling. Steven Finn was recalled to the team for this test. His delivery, Cook’s catch, the end of Steven Smith. For his next trick, the Australian captain undone perfectly. Michael Clarke out. Three wickets for England in the first hour. Good decision to lose the toss. Chris Rogers, after suffering dizziness at Lord’s, was passed fit to back here. England were a few inches from grabbing his wicket. Ben Stokes was England’s most athletic fielder, butjust as he landed so did the rain. Place East, but only briefly. We resumed with Australia trying to fight their way back in England desperate to restrain them. Giving chase, jonny Bairstow, bought into this match. Keane, isn’t he? Even when you are on top you fight for every centimetre. So Australia 72-3 and Steven Finn will be keen to get back out there, you could see his confidence return with every delivery. I also fear the drizzle will be with us here this afternoon. Oh dear, sorry to hear it. You may be old enough to remember the Kodak Brownie, the Polaroid Swinger or perhaps just the first iPhone. Taking photos has changed hugely in a relatively short space of time. As smartphones take over, our snaps are more often shared online. So is there still a future for the printed photo? john Maguire has been finding out. Here it comes! Hollywood’s finest. .. To our summer holidays - photography has immortalised our special moments for generations. You know how I got this? You knocked over your garbage can. We have been taking snaps for more than 100 years. Today, smartphones have allowed us all to become photographers, and the technology flatters our ability. Filters and things like that... But something has been lost in the digital revolution. There are billions of photographs out there, but fewer and fewer people take the trouble to print them and keep them. So, we take photographs but in terms of physical photographs, there are probably less being produced than 100 years ago. For decades, American giants Kodak and Polaroid helped us document our lives, but digital changed everything. Instant photography was declining at 25% a year. It was the scary, rapid decline which we saw happening to the analogue film industry. And so that was a transition that was very difficult, as things went to digital. Now, Polaroid is returning to its roots, with instant prints for the Instagram generation. You take your smartphone with an app and you transfer whatever image you want from your phone, Android, iOS, Apple, via Bluetooth to this printer, and it prints out these wonderful wallet-sized photographs. This looks quite nice... For some, just like vinyl records, analogue will never die. The artists in residence at the National Media Museum prefer film. Before, you’d take your films and get them processsed, and wait for the prints and get really excited about it. There is also the time issue, the time delay, which allowed excitement to build up in you, and a relationship to the memory of what you had shot as well, so that when you finally get it, it is like being reunited with something. It is a nice surprise when you develop the film and you see it come out really, really strong. So perhaps reports of the death of printed photographs are greatly exaggerated. Let’s look at the weather now with Matt Taylor. Good afternoon. A quick snapshot of the temperature is out there today, falling well short once again of where they should be for this stage of the year. Fast forward a few days toward Sunday and at last we started to warm things up a bit. No heatwave but certainly warmer than it has been of late. At the moment out there, winds coming from the north-west, hence the chilly feel. Clouds drifting southwards and eastwards on that breeze, building UP eastwards on that breeze, building up through the day with good gaps in between. Better chance of at least seeing sunshine for some of you compared with recent days. Showers in Northern Ireland and Wales, fewer showers in the afternoon. Some of the south-west staying completely dry. More showers further east, especially eastern Scotland and eastern England, chance of a rumble of thunder. These are the temperatures into the evening, starting to fall away, quite dramatically through tonight. The low pressure is pushing further and further away and notice how the ice bars are opening out which is assigned the winds are falling light. Showers down the eastern part of the country but in the West with the lightest wins it may be late July the lightest wins it may be late july but temperatures could get very close to freezing through raw parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland into tomorrow morning. Chilly start to Thursday. Showers gradually fading away. Tomorrow predominantly dry if not completely dry for a fair number of you. Whilst the temperatures are the same as today’s values will feel a little warmer given the fact that the winds are a little lighter. Good news for the women taking part in the British Open at Turnberry tomorrow, better prospects than they had for the men’s tournament a few weeks ago. But by Friday rain and a strengthening wind. It seems all too familiar. Another area of low pressure between Scotland and Iceland throwing in wet and windy weather towards western Scotland and Northern Ireland later in the day. South-westerly wind cutting off the two field, once you get a bit of sunshine it should feel a touch warmer. Southwards through Friday night puts us back on the wrong side of those weather fronts for the start of the weekend. Fresh once again. Sunshine and blustery showers. And, hot shower elsewhere. But by Sunday we start to draw winds from the South or Southwest. There could be some rain late in the day into Northern Ireland and western parts of the UK but many will be dry on Sunday. Feeling that little bit warmer, so some good news. Now a Nowa reminderof Now a reminder of our top story this lunchtime. Our man is killed in Calais as hundreds of migrants try to enter the Channel Tunnel for the second night running -- a man. Now time for the news where you are. Good afternoon and welcome to BBC London news. The app-based taxi booking service Uber is facing legal action over claims it is failing to provide legal workers rights to its drivers. The company, which has grown rapidly in the capital, has faced controversy since it was first launched. The GMB union say the drivers should get a minimum wage and paid holiday. Uber say becoming an employee would mean they’d lose their personal flexibility by working fixed shifts. Our transport correspondent Tom Edwards reports. ~ I think it is tough and the fares are so low that although you have the flexibility to name your hours, because the fares are so low and the income is low, you do have to work long hours to make it worthwhile. james is a driver for Uber.

On BBC London: Uber faces legal action from their drivers who want workers’ rights like the minimum wage. And we look at the campaign of the Islington MP jeremy Corbyn tipped to win the Labour leadership. Good evening. The French government is sending another 120 police officers to guard the Channel Tunnel, after hundreds of attempts were made by migrants to storm it for the second night running. One man, thought to be Sudanese, died after apparently being hit by a lorry. Eurotunnel says it’s blocked more than 37,000 people attempting to cross illegally in the first six months of this year. It’s now warning lorry drivers to consider alternative routes to crossing the Channel because of lengthy delays. In a moment, we’ll be reporting on the effect of the crisis here - but first to our correspondent Lucy Williamson, who’s in Calais for us now. Well, it used to be the ferry port that everybody here headed to at night. Now, the Channel Tunnel has become Calais’s summer target for migrants. 3500 people have been caught trying to get across to the UK so far this week. The French and UK governments have said they are going to do more, but while new barriers might change tactics here must they have not yet changed the migrants’ goals. A two-hour walk, barbed wire fences, hundreds of security forces and sniffer dogs. And still, they come to try their luck in the Channel Tunnel. Police recorded 1500 attempts last night, 2000 on Monday. How do you match determination like this? The perimeter of the Eurotunnel site is 14 miles long. The company says the number of migrants here has exploded, and that it has stopped 37,000 intrusions since the beginning of the year. The situation is beyond what they can handle, they say. The French government says it is sending two mobile forces units to help. Look along this fence, and you see signs of migrant crossing points. It is all crashed on up here, where people have tried to climb across. Here, someone has cut through the fence twice, leaving a hole just big enough for someone to slip through. Move along here, and you see the whole thing has been pulled out. But fences can be a deterrent. Earlier this year, Britain donated security barriers to protect Calais’s ferry port, previously the main target for migrants. Now the problem has moved to the tunnel, and the government has announced £7 million of funding to help secure that area as well. So will it solve Calais’s problem? TRANSLATION: You can build tall offences, but there will still risk it. It will only create more injured people. There with limits to securing a site, and the migrants will find them. The Eurotunnel site, with its moving trains and-says, is seen as more risky than the ferry port. In the migrant camp they call the jungle, port. In the migrant camp they call thejungle, doctors the jungle, doctors saw 65 patients yesterday, and injuries are getting worse. They have no idea other than to go to England, no other idea. But they have so much history of torture and suffering, because some have suffered violence, a lot of violence before coming here to France, that for them, before coming here to France, that forthem, it for them, it is once more. But it is not different than what they have in their country. The Calais’s migrants, the risks are growing. But the desire to take them is as strong as ever. Lucy Williamson, BBC News, Calais. The crisis has deepened problems here - with the M20 being used as a lorry park for over 3,500 vehicles which are unable to cross the Channel because of the migrants. The process, known as Operation Stack, is due to continue into the weekend. The Home Office says it won’t give a running commentary on the numbers, but the Home Secretary Theresa May conceded that some migrants have made it across the border. Duncan Kennedy has spent the day in Kent. With the chaos in Calais, these migrants made it through the Channel Tunnel today into Britain. Where are you from? Sedan. We came across them this afternoon on the M20. Exhausted, disorientated and now in the hands of the police. The Home Secretary would not say how many had made it through the tunnel in the past 48 hours, or whether troops would now be used. Crucially, we are looking at improving the security at the way ahead at Coquelles so that we can ensure that people are not trying to come through the tunnel. The latest security problems in France have again led to transport chaos in Britain today. It is costing billions. We spent the day withjohn Gardner, a lorry driver tried to get to the Channel Tunnel on the M20. This is ridiculous. All stuck? Yes. You must have worried from every country of Europe here, plus Turkey and other countries. At one point, we are stationary for two hours. Absolutely crazy. john comes prepared for a long wait. Make a cup of coffee. Do you feel drivers get enough protection? Not near Calais, not from this. They fined £2000 for each one we bring in, so they blame the drivers. How can it be the driver’s fault? Every hour he waits costs john £60. driver’s fault? Every hour he waits costsjohn £60. We have been stuck on this bit of motorway now for an hour and a half, on this bit of motorway now for an hourand a half, and it on this bit of motorway now for an hour and a half, and it has taken us five hours to travel about ten miles. The whole motorway is shut. We have still got more than 30 miles before we get to Dover. For hauliers and holiday-makers, this has been another traumatic day, driven by the events in France. Duncan Kennedy, BBC News, in Kent. Our political correspondent Carole Walkerjoins us from Westminster- the Government is now under increasing pressure to do more? Yes, and some MPs, especially those with constituencies directly affected are saying the government has not paid sufficient heed to all the one things about this looming summer crisis. You now have this build-up of migrant numbers causing real concern and chaos to many British holder makers as well as those hauliers and the businesses that rely on them -- those hauliers and the businesses that rely on them -- holiday-makers. Some in particularfeel the government needs to be more robust in terms of its dealings with the French. They say the French authorities, instead of sending some of the migrants a few miles up the road am leaving them free to come back and try again, should be detaining these people, processing them and if necessary deporting them. At the language from the parameter and the Home Secretary has been very careful. They know that they cannot afford to annoy the French because of this arrangement where we have border controls in Calais. If the French were to say, if you don’t like the way we are dealing with it, let’s move that back to Dover, and the problems this side of the channel would get a whole lot worse. How should medical staff care for terminally ill people in the last few days of their lives? Today, the health watchdog Nice has published new draft guidelines. They replace a controversial system in which some dying patients were thought to have been deprived of food and water. Our Health Correspondent Sophie Hutchinson reports. This hospital ward cares for some patients who are terminally ill. One of them, Simon Clayton, a writer and documentary maker, is being treated for advanced throat cancer. It makes it difficult to speak. Nevertheless, he explained what it’s meant to have such good care. They give you the opportunity to make the best of what you’ve got. That’s what theirjob is, and it’s fantastic. The new proposals published today by England’s health watchdog Nice aim to improve care for all adults in the last few days of life. The 32-page document lists recommendations for a more personalised approach, with daily reviews of hydration and medication, and stresses the importance of good communication. And doctors say getting care right doesn’t have to be complicated. It’s attention to the person, the detail, to assess how somebody’s feeling, whether they have any particular symptoms, whether they are being well looked after, whether they have had something to eat and drink. The proposals replaced the controversial system known as the Liverpool Care Pathway, a checklist heavily criticised for being a tick-box exercise used by inexperienced staff, which in the worst cases left patients so dehydrated that they tried to suck water from sponges used to moisten their mouths. There is little debate about what makes good end of life care, but the big question is how to deliver it, and will replacing the old checklist with new broader guidelines really ensure patients’ needs aren’t ignored? One of the problems with the Liverpool Care Pathway and why perhaps it became a tick-box exercise was that people didn’t have the training they need. So with these guidelines, and they are draft at the moment, we need to make sure there is continuing training. And that training can mean precious extra time. For Simon Clayton, it’s enabled him to keep working. I’m still getting on with my work. I’ve done work in the last couple of weeks to get things sorted out, which is great. Assessing when a patient is dying can be complex and difficult. The new guidelines aim to help staff identify that, and ensure the very best end to people’s lives. Sophie Hutchinson, BBC News. The inquiry into the Glasgow bin lorry crash has heard that the driver did not disclose a previous blackout on his medical assessment form. Six people died when the refuse truck ran out of control last December, after Harry Clarke collapsed at the wheel. It’s now emerged that he passed out while driving a bus five years earlier, but failed to mention this when applying for his job. Kevin Keane is in Glasgow for us now. What more was said in court? The inquiry was told that Harry Clark had lied in 2011 on a DVLA medical assessment form which asked the question, had he had any previous blackouts in the five years before that. He answered that by saying no. That was despite the fact that in 2010, he blacked out at the wheel of a bus he was driving in Glasgow. He had had to have three weeks off work as a result, and the sick note that was shown to the inquiry today confirmed that that was a result described in medical terms as fainting. We heard today from a manager in the bin lorry department where Harry Clark worked to confirm that he knew nothing about the 2010th incident. He would not have employed him as a lorry driver, had he known about that previous incident, and he was asked whether or not the five people who died in that crash in December would still be here today if Harry Clark had been honest about his medical history. He said yes, they would. At that point, there was audible sobbing in the court in the area reserved for the victims’ sobbing in the court in the area reserved for the victims’ families. We will hear from Harry Clark himself later in the inquiry. A computer programmer has been convicted of trying to buy the deadly poison ricin after being inspired by the American TV series, Breaking Bad. Mohammed Ali, who’s 31 and from Liverpool, ordered enough of the poison to kill 1,400 people. But he was unaware that his source was an FBI agent. The father-of-two was sent harmless powder hidden inside a toy car- and subsequently arrested. A survivor of the Hillsborough disaster who lost her brother and his girlfriend in the tragedy says being blamed for their deaths was almost as bad as the bereavement itself. Stephanie Conning was in tears as she gave evidence at the inquests into the deaths of Richard jones and Tracey Cox. Our correspondent, judith Moritz is there. Yes, the barristers had finished asking her their questions, but before she left the witness box here, a powerful moment for Stephanie Conning. She asked for permission to address the jury directly. And then, through tears, she said, please, it’s important to me. I need to say this, as she gave a hint of the trauma that Hillsborough has caused her. A teenager Ateenager in tragedy. Stephanie Conning just wanted to find her big brother. She escaped the crash, but couldn’t see him anywhere. Hillsborough takes over your life. 26 years later, Stephanie is still living with the pain of that day. She survived, but her brother and his girlfriend did not. Sometimes, it is hard to remember that you have lost two people that were extremely close to you because you are just reliving this process over and over again. Richard jones was a chemistry graduate who was passionate about football. As well as his sister, he also took his student girlfriend, Tracey Cox, to Hillsborough. She had only decided to go at the last minute. As the three of them arrived, they were caught in a crash outside the ground, jostling in the crowd and trying to hold onto each other. They got into the stadium when an exit gate was opened. The iurv when an exit gate was opened. The jury has heard that this was an police orders, but Stephanie says the fact that fans have been blamed has been nearly as hard to cope with as her bereavement. Her family were in court to watch as she made her point to the jury. Today was really hard for me. To listen to your door to giving evidence the way she did, it was really powerful, but it was very emotional for it was really powerful, but it was very emotionalfor me. And as her mum, Ifelt that. Stephanie was helped by other fans at Hillsborough. Today, through tears, she thanked them for what they did.

Two men have appeared in court in Zimbabwe charged with helping an American dentist kill one of the country’s best known lions. Cecil was wounded by an arrow and shot 40 hours later. Wildlife officials say he’d been lured from a protected game reserve where he was being monitored by British researchers. It’s brought the industry for hunting big game into the spotlight. Karen Allen reports. Cecil was already well- known in Zimbabwe, now he’s the most famous lion in the world. Shot dead by an American trophy hunter on wildlife safari. It is claimed he paid 50,000 US dollars for the controversial trip, now making headlines around the world. In court, the two men who led the expedition. Both are charged with poaching. Together, it is claimed they took the wealthy American out to track and kill. The illegal killing of this animal was done by people who had intentioned it well-planned, well-financed, to benefit someone with nothing to do with the conservation efforts in Zimbabwe. DoctorWalter with the conservation efforts in Zimbabwe. Doctor Walter Palmer is the tourist who is centre stage. These pictures show he has been on trophy hunts before but in a statement he said... Hate mail has forced him into hiding. It is this extraordinary wildlife that drives to Riz across Africa saw the widespread public outrage at the killing of Cecil was not simply sentimental but a reflection of global concerns, that in the past two decades, the numbers of Lions have dwindled by a staggering 75%. The depletion in numbers is largely explained by animals being forced off the land, but there is a growing demand for recreational hunting. Definitely hunting recreational hunting. Definitely hunting is becoming more popular. We find a lot of family groups coming over, combining hunting with photographic safaris. Hunting might be regulated but illegal hunting is a multi-million dollar business. The case of this may have caused anger across the world but conservationists claim 24 other tag lines have been killed in Zimbabwe in the past two years and nobody has ever beenjailed. -- Lions. An eight-year-old American boy has become the world’s youngest recipient of a double hand transplant. Doctors say Zion Harvey’s operation is a medical breakthrough and a huge step forward in transplants. Zion described waking up with new hands as ""weird at first, but then good."" Here’s our health correspondent jane Dreaper. A quick we’ve was one of his new hands. Zion smiled as the result of his ground-breaking operation was revealed. I want to thank you guys for helping me on this bumpy road. Surgeons in Philadelphia say Zion has been not complaining as a patient. The hands will grow with him, allowing him to achieve his dream of throwing a football. We have every reason to believe that because his hands are alive and his growth plates are intact that he will grow like a normal child. It is not the first time Zion has needed significant medical treatment. He lost his hands and feet after suffering a serious infection when he wasjust two. suffering a serious infection when he was just two. He he wasjust two. He had a kidney transplant. At that helped him prepare for this operation because he was already used to drugs which stop the body rejecting new tissue. I told my mum I was not going to cry. I am sorry.

Months of physiotherapy lie ahead but this remarkable boy from Baltimore has already made medical history. Microsoft has launched its new Windows 10 operating system - and is giving it to existing Windows users free of charge. It’s the first software to run across all Windows-powered devices - including PCs, tablets, phones and game consoles. It comes at a time when Microsoft is struggling to compete in the world of mobile computing, as our Technology correspondent Rory Cellan-jones reports. Take Ta ke any mother, and child. They will almost certainly have a Windows PC they will also have tablets and phones not made by Microsoft. What does this look like to you? This is their first glimpse of it. Microsoft needs it to be a hit to persuade the world it is still cutting edge. Here is one thing, The Voice assistant, which needs to learn how you speak. In the past we were just using our laptop or desktop, so Windows was everything. Now we are using increasing of mobile devices with different operating systems and Microsoft is probably less relevant. They are giving it away for free. What do you think that is about? I think they realise if they want people to have a complete Windows experience on hand-held devices and laptops they need to incentivise. On personal computers, Microsoft is still completely dominant, with 91% of the market, but on smartphones, they only have a 3% share whilst apple have an 18% and Google’s system have 78%. When I got my first demo, I was shown facial recognition. just look at the computer to logon. The start button, who disappeared in Windows eight, is back. Microsoft’s new boss says the system fits into the era of mobile computing. There will be more computing, and I think of this as the operating system notjust for one device but for all the devices in your life. Back at the house, the child has already learned how to use a tablet computer. Convincing the next generation to live in the Windows world will be quite a challenge for Microsoft. Cricket - and England have dominated Australia on the first day of the pivotal third Ashes test in Birmingham. Despite losing the toss England bowled the tourists out forjust 136 runs. Our Sports correspondent joe Wilson joins us now from Edgbaston. Yes, this has been an extraordinary day. Not only are England batting but they have almost overtaken Australia already. Ian Bell has been batting fluently and one way or another, almost everything has gone the way of Alastair Cook. On the first morning of a Test match, William things in the mind of a captain. First and foremost, the sheer act of chance. How will the coin decide the direction of play? Australia’s luck that their captain won the toss. England’s like that Australia decided to bat. Clouds in the sky, grass on the wicket and jimmy Anderson with the ball. David Warner, LBW. Steven Finn got rid of Steve Smith. Michael Clarke came next. Three wickets before lunch. jimmy Anderson then feasted on bats for desert. -- batsmen. Peter Neville did well, but nothing. Only Chris Rodgers had resisted, playing despite dizziness in the last test. He was battling to 52 before Stuart Broad got him out. Australia were all out for 136. England’s all time best bowler with one of his very best days. Anyone passing this part of Birmingham would have a very good idea of what was going on. The question was, would England love batting here? Alastair Cook looked batting here ? Alastair Cook looked good batting here? Alastair Cook looked good until his luck ran out. Somehow thatis good until his luck ran out. Somehow that is out. It was still his day. Racing commentator Sir Peter O’Sullevan has died at home in London after a long illness. Peter O’Sullevan, who was 97, had one of the best-known voices in broadcasting. He made his first appearance on the BBC in 1948 and commentated on television for half a century. He was known throughout the racing world as ""the Voice"". Now the weather. We are going to baskin Now the weather. We are going to bask in the glory of what happened at Edgbaston little longer because this picture tells story perfectly. The jubilation of the crowd in the foreground behind you concede the threatening shower clouds. They were a bit of a nuisance from time to time. In actual fact we had plenty of showers right across the country. We started off promising but the showers driven in by this strong north-westerly breeze became fairly frequent into the afternoon and some of them quite heavy. But the wind will fall light through the evening and overnight and the showers die away as well. That brings another set of problems, quite unusual for this time of year, quite a cold start with single figures quite likely in the morning. Frost is not out of the question. It will be a dry and sunny start for many, and with light wind it will feel more pleasant than the last couple of days. Risk of a few showers but hopefully they will stay isolated. By 4pm it looks like something like this across Scotland, much better than we started the week. Perhaps some showers in the Western Isles, some into Northern Ireland in the latter stages of the afternoon, but temperatures in the mid-teens. Dry enough across England and North Wales, some showers in East Anglia, 21 is not out of the question. More sunshine around but that breeze is coming from the north-west, but it will be fairly light. The wind will swing round to a south-westerly, that will be good news for England and Wales, unfortunately circulating around this low-pressure, which could bring further rain into Northern Ireland and Scotland during Friday, and rather windy. Some decent spells of sunshine and starting to see some warm developing, and continuing to build as we go into the weekend. That is The minicab booking service Uber faces legal action over the way it treats its drivers. Our belief is that drivers throughout the profession do not have a reasonable quality of life. But Uber sees it as fully licensed and defence the way it employs drivers. And how the red tide keeps drawing behind jeremy Corbyn in his bid to become Labour Party leader. And I knew better off living one hour outside the capital? For me it was having children, having more Green space. Plans to create a helter-skelter down the Orbit get the go-ahead. Welcome to BBC London News with me Riz Lateef. It’s the app-based minicab booking service that’s been controversial ever since it arrived in the capital. Now Uber is facing legal action over claims it’s failing to provide workers’ rights to its drivers. The GMB union says the drivers should get a minimum wage and paid holiday. The company, which has grown rapidly in London, says if drivers became employees they would have to work fixed shifts and would lose their flexibility. Our transport correspondent Tom Edwards reports. I think it is tough. I think fares are so low that although you have the flexibility to name your hours, because the fares are low and the income is therefore low, you do have to work very long hours to make it worthwhile. james is an Uber driver. He was recently assaulted by a passenger. After he involved the police it took the company 12 weeks to supply the Met with documents. He is also a human rights activist. He thinks as an employer the company should look after their drivers more. With the correct rights it would address things like anti-discrimination for drivers, protection against being discriminated against, proper rest breaks, that’s important notjust for drivers but for riders as well. You don’t want to be taking a ride with a driver who is now working his 18th hour. Uber is a phone app that means you can hail a private hire car. But it is controversial. There have been demonstrations from cab drivers. They think it breaches laws that stop minicabs having devices that calculate fares. And it isn’t properly regulated by Transport for London. And now unions say Uber drivers should have workers’ rights like the minimum wage and paid holidays. People who are having to work seven days a week, that isn’t really a life. Quality of life is important to everyone and our belief is that generally speaking drivers in the profession do not have a reasonable quality of life. They are almost viewed as second-class citizens by the public. There is now a record number of 84,000 private hire cars in London. TfL wants a cap. It says they are adding to the congestion. Lawyers think this case could set a precedent. This kind of platform is the new way that companies will operate and what it involves is there is some level of casualisation of the workforce. And what that means is we need to make sure that the law applies to these new technologies and new technology companies in the same way. Yes I think it will be important. Uber, though, says that making drivers employees means they would lose their flexibility. Some drivers like it the way it is. If I don’t want to work tomorrow night or tomorrow morning I don’t need to tell anyone. If I want to work more, during the day yesterday, I decided impromptu I wanted to work three hours more, I didn’t need to ask the boss for that, I just stayed in the car and drove around. So it suits you the way it is? Absolutely. Are you anti regulation? No. Uber in the United Kingdom is fully regulated and fully licensed and there is a very sensible regulatory model that we have in the UK and that we have here particularly in London. We would like to have that model elsewhere. So we are not anti-regulation. We are entrepreneurs, we are not politicians. I would say we are not the right people to answer that question. Now a tribunal will decide whether Uber drivers should have more workers’ rights. ",,
121,BBC News 24,29-jul-2015,BBC News at Ten,22:00,30 mins,True,"Tonight at Ten, the children sold into sex slavery across America. We have a special investigation, into what the FBI says is a crisis that’s reaching epidemic proportions. Since the beginning of time sex trafficking has been ongoing. But the level of paedophilia is just unprecedented right now. We’ll be looking at what the police and FBI are doing to combat the traffickers. Also on the programme: The migrant crisis in Calais - France sends more police to guard the Channel Tunnel, after hundreds of attempts to cross into the UK. The inquiry into the Glasgow bin lorry crash, hears the driver lied about a blackout behind the wheel of another vehicle, failing to tell his employer. Two men have appeared in court in Zimbabwe, after the killing of Cecil, one of the country’s most famous lions. And he had one of the most distinctive voices in broadcasting. Tonight on BBC London. Booking firm Uber faces legal action over cab drivers’ rights, after claims over pay, tiredness and safety. And how living an hour outside London can save you hundreds of thousand pounds. Good evening. The FBI has told the BBC that levels of child trafficking for sex across America, have reached almost epidemic proportions. Last year federal agents rescued more than 600 children from a life of exploitation, while it’s estimated every night hundreds are sold for sex. This week on the BBC News at Ten, we’ve been focusing on the issue of human trafficking, and law enforcement agencies in the US say the numbers of children exploited for sex, have been rising steadily since the 1990s. And this map highlights some of the hotspots where youngsters are being trafficked. It’s a problem right across the country. Our international correspondent Ian Pannell has this special report now from Baltimore, and just to warn you, it does contain some harrowing testimony. There is a terrible darkness coursing through the veins of America. Most have no idea it is there and some choose not to know. But every night, hundreds of American children are being sold for sex in their own country. I got involved in prostitution when I was 11+. Since I was 15. He knew I was 14. He had to know that I was underage. The level of paedophilia is just unprecedented. At 12, it was not a choice. A toxic mixture of poverty, abuse and neglect leaves girls and boys vulnerable to the predators and traffickers. They are gang members, pimps masquerading as boyfriends, drug addicts and violent men who force children to have sex with others. Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change... Very few escape until they are adults. Breaking Free is a group helping women who have been trafficked. We were allowed rare access to one of their meetings. Some did not want their faces shown, although many in this film have chosen to speak out. Almost half of the women here were first exploited when they were still children. I was 11+. He had to know I was underage. When he found out how old I was, he wanted to be with me even more. Most of the women we have spoken to said the younger they were, the more money they made. Even the group moderator who was sold for sex as a child herself. I was 11+ years old and I’m looking at this picture going, I made $1000 on a weekday, 2000 on a Friday or Saturday, and I looked 11+. You know, I had to turn people away sometimes. So, the younger the better. More than 600 children were rescued by the FBI last year, in a battle law enforcement is struggling to win. The level of paedophilia is just unprecedented right now. We have so many cases constantly of individuals in all walks of life, from the very wealthy highly professionally paid individuals, to other levels, engaged in trial pornography, engaged in child pornography, child exploitatin and so forth. Itjust seems to be almost at an epidemic level. I started when I was 12. With my neighbour BLEEP. My neighbour up the street from my mum’s house. He was an older guy. He had fun pinball machines and stuff like that. He wanted to take pictures and pay me $50 at first to take a tops off picture. It would be, cool, 12 years old, $50 is a lot of money. He had friends come over and have meth parties or parties, and those guys would also want some kind of sexual activity and I would get paid for it. This woman is still out on the streets, five months pregnant. She wanted to speak out about the exploitation of children and her own abuse from the age of 12. I’m seeing more and more younger girls out here now. It isjust really sad because this is not a choice. At 12, it was not a choice. It seemed like a choice but you don’t know anything that young. You think, wow, it is money. But it wasn’t a choice. Tens of thousands of children are thought to be exploited every year in America and trafficked into prostitution. Some of them end up out here on the streets, but many more appear online, out of sight and often out of mind. I look for the girls who look younger. I’m looking for girls who don’t have tattoos, baby fat, who are concealing their face. Police investigators trawl through online sites searching for women and children who have been trafficked and are being sold for sex. One website above all occupies theirattention, backpage.com. This girl looks kind of young here. The youngest girl we have ever got was I3 years of age. I3 years of age. The majority are 16, 17. A lot of the girls we get are 18 years old, we still offer them help. It does not matter if they are 18 or 15, I could care less. They are still a kid in my eyes. Trafficking has prospered as technology makes it easier to sell children online. It took us just ten minutes to find this advert. The girl, clearly appears underage. We have notified the authorities and backpage admits this advert should never have been posted, and it insists it works with the police and screens postings, but this one and many others get through. The Samaritan women give shelter to those who survive this modern day slavery. There are many reasons why so many children in America are trafficked. Poverty, neglect and drugs play a part. But above all, it is violence and abuse at home. It was when I was eight years old that I was first molested by my father. The first time that happened, I got a bike. As a gift, a reward? Yes. How do you think that led to where you ended up? I learned very early that you could get things that you wanted or needed, through sexual favours. And I know that a lot of my thinking, as far as I interacted with men stemmed from what happens between the ages of eight and 12. President Obama calls this a nature -- nation of second chances. For many, this is where their American dream ends. Well, that was the final report in our special series looking at human trafficking. As well as America, we’ve investigated the situation here in the UK, where the government says up to 13,000 people are victims of modern slavery. We heard harrowing testimony from girls who were trafficked as young as 13. And we visited Nigeria, one of the biggest nationalities trafficked into the UK, and heard from one woman who sold girls into prostitution for $500 each. With me now is Kevin Hyland, the UK’s Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner. Through our investigations, we have seen the scale of the trafficking crisis. Is there any sense as to why the problem is getting worse? This problem is they’re mainly because of the demand. It is there whether for sexual exploitation, domestic servitude or organs. There is someone asking for that and someone willing to supply it so it is there much a demand issue. If we look internationally, there are problems because of conflict, problems because of natural disasters, said there are around 50 million people in the world at the moment who are vulnerable and displaced. They become a market for those who want to trafficked and exploit people. They are targeting those people and they are making promises to them that they will get a better life somewhere in the world. But those promises are not fulfilled. We have a lack of resources. At the moment, there is not enough resources allocated to this issue, either in the United Kingdom or internationally. It is not coordinated enough, but this is something which is changing in the UK. Here in Britain, the Modern Slavery Act comes into force on Friday. Do you think that will improve the situation? I think it will make a big difference. It will make it easierfor law will make a big difference. It will make it easier for law enforcement and prosecutors to target those who commit serious crimes. It will allow the authorities to strip assets. It will also increase the penalty to one of life imprisonment. But very importantly and crucially, it provides better support for victims. Evidence shows that unless victims are supported and able to come forward, it is very hard to tackle this crime. This raft of measures, and along with my role internationally, I have travelled to Nigeria and will soon travel to Vietnam, and also the legislation will have a supply chain transparency element, it will really change the attitudes towards this in the business industry, but also people in the street and people will see what companies are doing in the UK to make sure their supply chains are slavery free. Many thanks. The French government is sending an extra 120 police officers to guard the Channel Tunnel. The move comes after a man died, apparently hit by a lorry, as migrants trying to reach the UK made more than 1,500 attempts to break into the Eurotunnel terminal. According to the last official count, around 3,000 migrants were living in the makeshift camps in Calais. But officials believe there are many more. Lucy Williamson has sent us this report. A two-hour walk, barbed wire fences, hundreds of security forces and sniffer dogs, and still they come, to try their luck in the Channel Tunnel. The perimeter of the Eurotunnel site is 14 miles long. The company says the number of migrants here has exploded, and the situation is beyond what they can handle. The French government says it is sending 120 extra police to help. Look along this fence and you see signs of migrant crossing points. It is all crushed in up here where people have tried to climb across. Here, someone has cut through the fence twice over leaving a hole just big enough for someone to slip through. Move along here, you see the whole thing has been pulled out. But fences can be a deterrent. Early this year, Britain donated security barriers to protect Calle’s ferry port. Now the migrants have moved to the tunnel, the government has announced £7 million of funding to help secure that area as well. TRANSLATION: You can build more fences but they will risk it. They’re always limits to securing a site and the migrants will always find those limits. But as queues piled up on the other side of the Channel, the government said it was pressing ahead with its plan to protect the tunnel entrance with fencing used for a Nato summit. The French police have been providing security and the French government have enabled extra police to be made available. One of the things we are doing is pressing to ensure we can get the security fencing up as quickly as possible, to ensure we reduce this problem. Amid the chaos, some migrants are getting through. They are a small fraction of the 25,000 asylum applications made in Britain last year, but each one is a beacon for those hoping to follow. Hope of reaching Britain is leading the bottleneck in Calais. Most migrants entered Europe through its southern borders. Almost 80,000 migrants have arrived in Italy so far this year. Around the same number in Greece. Today, another 450 were picked up off the coast of Italy and taken ashore. 14 had already died at sea. No matter what the barriers, it seems, migrants here give up their lives much more easily than their goals. Well, night has fallen in Calais and the security guards are braced for whatever the next few hours will bring. just to give you an idea of what they are up against, I want to tell you about a man I met today. He is from Ethiopia and he was arriving in Calais for the first time. He told me he spent most of his adult life doing military service in Ethiopia. He spent ten days drifting on the Mediterranean Sea, and then passed through six European countries including Germany and now France. Never once had he wavered from his goal of getting to the UK. The question people here in Calais need to be asking themselves tonight, what do people like him do when faced with a perimeter fence? Thank you. The second largest trade union Unison has given its backing to candidate jeremy Corbyn for leadership of the Labour party. The announcement of support follows that of the largest union, Unite. However endorsement by the union does not necessarily mean its members will vote for Mr Corbyn, as they are free to cast their votes as they choose. Our political correspondent Carole Walkerjoins us now from Westminster. How significant are these endorsements forjeremy Corbyn? It is another important boost for jeremy Corbyn’s campaign. He has not only got the backing of the two biggest unions, but Unison is considered a mainstream union, considered very moderate, and even some of Mr Corbyn’s campaign team had not expected to get its support. The members do not have to follow the leadership’s lead but Dave Prentice, the general secretary said he had canvassed views widely and he said jeremy Corbyn had spoken their language and would reflect their views on for example opposing the Tories on austerities and the Trident nuclear system when there was not enough money for social care. This does provide another sense thatjeremy Corbyn is generating the most excitement and enthusiasm. It is an unpredictable race with new rules and new members signing up to take part in the contest. For all signing up to take part in the contest. Forall that contest. For all that sense of momentum thatjeremy Corbyn is generating, there is also a sense of alarm from others within the party, who take a different view about what its future direction should be. If jeremy Corbyn were to win and that is possible, he faces a mighty task to unite the party. Thank you. Let’s look at some of the day’s other news. Sources in Afghanistan have said this evening that the Taliban leader Mullah Omar died two years ago in Pakistan. A spokesman for Afghanistan’s security services said that the reclusive Mullah Omar had died of health problems at a hospital in Pakistan. The Taliban is expected to issue a statement soon. A computer programmer has been convicted of trying to buy the deadly poison ricin after being inspired by the American TV series, Breaking Bad. Mohammed Ali, who’s 31 and from Liverpool, ordered enough of the poison to kill 1,400 people. But he was unaware his supplier was an undercover FBI agent. A woman travelling with three children has been arrested on suspicion of preparing to travel to Syria to engage in terrorism. West Midlands Police said that the suspect, who’s 30 and from Leicester, was detained at Birmingham Airport earlier this morning. Counter-terrorism officers are now searching her home and another associated address. The inquiry into the Glasgow bin lorry crash has heard that the driver did not disclose a previous blackout on his medical assessment form. Six people died when the refuse truck ran out of control last December, after Harry Clarke collapsed at the wheel. It’s now emerged that he passed out while driving a bus five years earlier, but failed to mention this when applying for his job. Kevin Keane is in Glasgow for us now. What more was said in court? The enquiry was told today that Harry Clarke had lied in 2011 on a DVLA health assessment form which asked the question, had he had any blackouts in the previous five years? He said on the form that he had not, despite the fact that a year earlier, he had blacked out at the wheel of a bus in Gaza. He had to take three weeks of work as a result of that and the sick note was shown today to the court. -- result of that and the sick note was shown today to the court. -- of a bus in Glasgow. It confirmed he had been off work because of fainting. We also heard from Harry Clarke’s bossin We also heard from Harry Clarke’s boss in the Ben Lawrie Department and he said he knew nothing about the 2010 incident. He would not have appointed Harry Clarke as a bin lorry driver if he had known about the previous incident. When he was asked whether or not the six people who died at Christmas in this crash would still be alive today if he had been honest about his medical history, you replied yes, they would. Harry Clarke in self is due to give evidence later in the enquiry. -- himself. Two men have appeared in court in Zimbabwe, charged with helping an American dentist kill one of the country’s best-known lions. Cecil was wounded by an arrow and shot 40 hours later. Wildlife officials say he’d been lured from a protected game reserve where he was being monitored by British researchers. The killing has focused attention on the industry for hunting big game. Karen Allen reports. Cecil was already well- known in Zimbabwe. Now he is the most famous lion in the world, shot dead by an American trophy hunter on a wildlife Safari. It is claimed he paid $50,000 for the controversial trip which is now making headlines around the world. In court today, the two men who led the expedition both faced charges of poaching. A landowner, a professional hunter, who organises legal hunts for tourists. Together, it is claimed they took the wealthy American out illegally, without a valid permit. just one word of regret. How do you feel? Terrible. DrWalter just one word of regret. How do you feel? Terrible. Dr Walter Palmer, a Minnesota dentist is the tourists who is now centrestage. These pictures show he has been on trophy hunts before but in a statement he said he had paid the two men to go on the legal hunts. He added:. This study that we are conducting in Zimbabwe, in a national park and have done to 20 years, is contributing to understanding the problems that Lions face. Science can contribute solutions to those problems and we can inform policymakers to make the future of Lions better. Of course it is this extraordinary wildlife which drives tourism across Africa. The widespread public outrage at the killing of Cecil was not simply a sentimental reaction, but a reflection of global concern is that in the past two decades across Africa, the numbers of Lions have dwindled by a staggering 75%. The depletion of numbers is largely down to animals being forced off the land. But there’s a growing demand for recreational hunting. Definitely, hunting safaris are becoming more popular. We find a lot of family groups coming over, combining hunting with photographic safaris. Hunting may be regulated but poaching is now a multi-million dollar business. The case of this favourite big cat may have caused anger across the but conservationists claim two dozen other tag lines have been killed in Zimbabwe in the past two years. And no one has ever been sent a jail. -- tagged Lions. Catherine jones, Kenya. England’s health watchdog, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has published new draft guidelines on how the NHS should treat people in their last few days of life. They replace a controversial pathway, in which some dying patients were thought to have been deprived of food and water. Tonight, we hear from a daughter who feels the NHS let down her dying mother, and a doctor, about getting end-of-life care right. I’m Charity and my mum, Valerie died in hospital in 2014. She had pancreatic cancer and died with no pain relief. There was no plan put in place. We were in an open bay with a girl opposite on a nebuliser. Ijust kept thinking how awful it must be for her to watch us, watching our mum died. My mum had 65 great years of life although those have all now been tarnished and removed from my mind because all we can focus on is those last 21 hours when she was just in excruciating pain. ~ I think someone who is peaceful, someone who is out of pain, someone who is well looked after by a team, with the ability to have their family there, the ability to have comfort as needed, including eating and drinking when they can, if all those things are met, that I think yes, it is possible, in inverted commas come as much as it could be for someone to achieve a good death. ~ I hope the Nice guidelines will make a change and they are a stepping stone in the right direction so we can avoid patients suffering unnecessarily like my mum did. The thoughts of two people on end of life care. An eight-year-old American boy has become the world’s youngest recipient of a double hand transplant. Doctors say Zion Harvey’s operation is a medical breakthrough, and a huge step forward in transplants. Zion described waking up with new hands as ""weird at first, but then good"". Here’s our health correspondent jane Dreaper. APPLAUSE. A quick wave with one of his new hands. Zion smiled as details of his ground-breaking operation were unveiled. I want to say to you guys, thank you for helping me through this bumpy road. Scott is holding his hand firmly. Surgeons in Philadelphia say Zion has been an uncomplaining patient. The hands will grow as he does, allowing him to achieve his dream of throwing a football. We have every reason to believe that because Zion’s hands are alive and his growth plates are intact from the donor, he will grow like a normal child. Zion’s hands and feet were amputated after he suffered a serious infection at the age of two. He also needed a kidney transplant but that helped prepare him for this operation, because he was already used to drugs which stop the body rejecting new tissue. 40 doctors and nurses worked on Zion’s new hands in 11 hours of intricate surgery earlier this month. Details have been made public now the doctors are sure it has been B SUCCESS. It’s really amazing, what I can do. They have tears ofjoy all the time. Months of physiotherapy lie ahead, and it will take time to the nerves in his fingers to start working. But this remarkable eight-year-old has already made medical history. jane Dreaper, BBC News. In cricket, England have dominated Australia on the first day of the pivotal third Ashes Test in Birmingham despite losing the toss. The hosts bowled the tourists out forjust 136. Here is Patrick Geary. Ten years ago in Birmingham, England beat Australia in a Test so dramatic and symbolic, that its spirit seems to hang in the Edgbaston air. Certainly, jimmy Anderson was inspired. He had David Warner lbw, pointing the way for what was to come. Steven Finn had not played in a Test match in two years. He’s had to start again. Sixth delivery, he dismissed Steve Smith, the world’s best batsman. Two overs later, he bamboozled Australian captain Michael Clarke. Anderson was about to begin one of those spells. After lunch, he shattered the Aussie middle order. This was Mitchelljohnson, so feared with ball but now so timid with bat. Anderson’s fifth wicket. He would finish with six. Australia were toast long before the tea-time sandwiches. When Chris Rogers’ resistance ended, the innings followed soon afterwards. 136 all out. Of course, now England had to bat, stay disciplined and leave these alone. Adam Voges clung on. How long can Adam Lyth do the same? Ian Bell was another under pressure but you would never tell. He glided to 50 on his home ground, put England in charge. This should have been the final image. Instead, there was an unfortunate postscript. A rush of blood, a rushed shot and Australia have something to grasp at on a day which had been wholly England’s. Patrick Geary, BBC News. The racing commentator, Sir Peter O’Sullevan has died at home in London after a long illness. He was 97. He made his first appearance on the BBC in 1948 and commentated on television for half a century. Our sports correspondent joe Wilson looks back at his career. Breed of Tears from Newlands General, racing into the closing stages. If you recall the names of the 20th century’s great racehorses, the chances are you heard them described by this voice. Into the final furlong, here comes Lester Piggott on Nijinsky. Lester Piggott on the near side. As they come to the line, she has made it! Dawn Runner has won it! Hats off and a tremendous reception. You’ve never heard anything like it in Liverpool! Red Rum wins the National! I’m seriously privileged to have called so many marvellous races and so many wonderful horses. Horses really were the principal, certainly the first attraction. Peter O’Sullevan’s youthful interest in racing was sparked by listening to radio commentary when it all began in 1927. His own broadcasting career lasted over 50 years. His success was based on preparation, the study of runners and riders. Racecards were meticulously prepared and always within reach, alongside the microphone. Peter O’Sullevan was knighted in 1997. Sir Peter O’Sullevan! Deeply respected within racing, he went on to raise millions for charity, funding and inspiring animal welfare work around the world. His commitment and passion were always there to hear, in every word and every horse. Then Try It Again, then General Wolfe... Sir Peter O’Sullevan, who died today. He was 97.

Uber, the app-based car booking service is facing legal action over basic workers’ rights for its drivers. It’s accused of breaching its duty on health and safety, pay and holidays - with particular concern raised about the safety of drivers and their passengers. The company, which has caused widespread protests across Europe, says its drivers ""love"" the flexibility the firm offers them. Tom Edwards has been hearing some of the problems. Because the fares are so low and the income is low, you have to work very long hours to make it worthwhile. james is an Uber driver. He was recently assaulted by a passenger. After he involved the police, it took the company 12 weeks to supply the Met with documents. He is also a human rights activist. He thinks as an employer, the company should look after their drivers more. With the correct rights, it would address things like anti-discrimination for for drivers and protections against being discriminated against. Proper rest breaks are important, notjust for drivers but for riders as well. You don’t want to be taking a ride with a driver who has been working 18 hours. Uber is a phone app which means you can hail a private-hire car but it is controversial. ",,

Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. David Cameron has said extra sniffer dogs and fencing will be sent to France to help tackle the Calais migrant crisis. Earlier he had chaired a meeting of the Government’s emergency committee Cobra. There’s been disruption around the Channel Tunnel for a fourth consecutive night, with French police saying more than a thousand attempts were made to break through their lines at the terminal overnight. In Kent, thousands of lorries remain queuing on the M20 as part of Operation Stack. Andy Moore is in Ashford. Andy. Yes, hello Simon. The lorries are just shunting up a little here, but they are not going very far very fast. Operation Stack is still very much in force. David Cameron says this disruption is unacceptable to lorry drivers and to the people of Kent. He wants to do as much as possible to reduce it. He’s talking about more sniffer dogs, more money, more fencing. He says the current situation is unacceptable. Even though extra police officers have been brought in, they are no match for the sheer determination of the migrants trying to get to the UK. Despite all the effort in France, some are getting through. Here you can see two migrants clinging to the top of a lorry as it leaves the Eurotunnel terminal at Folkestone. David Cameron hosted a meeting of the emergency committee Cobra this morning. He promised more resources, more and betterfencing. I’ll be speaking with President Hollande later today, and I want to thank him for the extra French police resources that have been put in, that have had some effect. But we are keen to offer more and work hand in glove with them to reduce the pressure on that side of the border. But the road haulage industry is not impressed. Quite simply the measures I have just heard from David Cameron aren’t enough, they are just sticking plasters. The impact financially on the haulage industry, and the broader economic UK industry is unbelievable. On the M20 coast bound in Kent, another row of lorries comes to a halt. The queues might not be as bad as they were a few days ago but even so, from here, lorry drivers face a wait of seven hours before they get to the channel. Operation Stack was supposed to be an emergency measure. Now it is almost routine daily occurrence. Here we have a main artery route through Kent used as a truck parked for lorries. Surely there must be an alternative. Those alternatives were discussed this morning at a summit in Kent attended by the county council, the transport minister and local MPs. You hoping to this crisis? Yes indeed. There is talk of using MOD land to park the lorries. Local people are just fed UP lorries. Local people are just fed up with gridlock roads. It is a separate problem, asl up with gridlock roads. It is a separate problem, as I see it. The impact on Kent is diabolical. Really disruptive for the town, isn’t it? And yet, I’m glad David Cameron is doing something, at least I hope he is. It’sjust appalling. How can Kent continue like this? David Cameron says the problems in Calais and Kent are likely to last across the summer, there will be no quick fixes. The latest travel information, delays of up to an hour on Eurotunnel, the ferry operators are talking about diversions through the town of Calais to get to the port. Obviously still problems on the French side. Thank you very much. Each night, migrants desperately try to vault fences and climb onto lorries and trains heading through the Channel tunnel. Last night was no exception. From Calais, Paul Adams reports on the lengths the migrants are going to, to reach the UK. We’re just short of the freight terminal here. It’s basically over in this direction. It’s one of the spots that has obviously been identified as a weak spot. You can pul the fence up here, creep in underneath. And then you’re inside the first perimeter fence. Behind us in the fields there are groups of migrants approaching. I can see them coming up from the cornfields here. They’re also up on this bridge above us. We have seen quite a few up there. I would say in the last five minutes or so we’ve seen a couple of hundred people. One of two of those girls look quite young. Where are you from? From Eritrea? So, there are half a dozen police officers walking down the tracks inside. They’re obviously looking for the migrants. Once the migrants get inside this very large complex, they scatter, they hide and wait for an opportunity, just as a train gets ready to go, tojump on board. So, there could right now be dozens, perhaps even a few hundred people hiding inside the terminal complex. It’s really interesting, watching how the police do this. They are not racing after everybody. They know there are simply too many people in there. They’re just grabbing handfuls where they can. But they also know, and they’ve said to us, at the end of the night, some people, a few dozen, perhaps, will have made it through. They don’t seem to mind. Are you going to go back to the camp? Well, they’re pretty disappointed, as you can imagine. They’ve had a go, it hasn’t worked. But, as far as I can make out, their English wasn’t great, my Arabic was even worse, that’s not it for the evening. They are probably going to go back up there and try again. But there are obviously plenty of police inside. Enough, it seems, to make it difficult for large numbers to get to the trains. Our Political Correspondent Alan Soady is in Downing Street. David Cameron looking for a solution? He chaired that meeting less than two hours after arriving back from his trip to Southeast Asia. Clearly be Prime Minister wanting to be seen to be leading the government’s response, trying to prove to all those caught up in this chaos that he and his ministers are getting a grip on it. Rejecting the criticisms of some that the government’s response has been too slow, not enough measures have been taken, and that warning signs were missed from weeks ago. In terms of the action agreed at this committee meeting, it is partly working with the French authorities, partly giving the French more resources like fencing and sniffer dogs, and David Cameron also saying he will speak to President Hollande later today. There is the situation closer to home as well, the chaos in Kent, and the government is looking at opening up disused Ministry of Defence land as some sort of lorry park. Forthe Defence land as some sort of lorry park. For the holiday-makers and lorry drivers caught up in this, it’s not words they want to hear, they want to see action. It’s been described as a ‘gamechanger’ in the fight against Ebola. Initial results from a vaccine trial in Guinea are ""exciting"" and ""promising"", according to the World Health Organisation. Ata At a news conference a short time ago they heard the vaccine could bring an end to the epidemic in Africa. This sounds very exciting? Absolutely, not often you hear the assistant director-general of the World Health Organization describe something as a potential Game Changers. It is exciting. It looks as though the world ‘s first Ebola vaccine may have been created. It was created and child in Guinea. The close contact, 100 patients, were given this vaccine. Some were given the vaccine immediately as soon as they were known to have been at risk and there was 100% success. 1500 people had a delay, with a three-week delay, and there were 16 cases of ebola that therefore developed. So the trial has been stopped, because it has been seen to be so incredible is successful. Everyone at risk will be given the vaccine now, including perhaps adolescence and children. One final point to mention is how quickly they have developed this, it has been unprecedented, the speed. There has beenjust unprecedented, the speed. There has been just a huge global push ever since these communities were devastated by the virus. An eighteen month old Palestinian boy has been killed in an arson attack by suspected jewish settlers in the West Bank. His parents, brother and another child were injured when a fire bomb was thrown into the house, near the town of Nablus. The Israeli government has described it as a barbaric act of terrorism. Our Diplomatic Correspondent, james Robbins, reports As the Palestinian family slept inside, fire bombs were thrown into their home. The mother and one child managed to get out with horrible burns, but they and their neighbours could not save the 18-month-old baby. Israeli settlers have been blamed. Attackers sprayed the word revenge in Hebrew on a wall under the Star of David. The mother is about 26 years old with 90% third-degree burns. We are now treating her son about four years old, with about 60% burns out of his total body surface area. Israeli security forces say they will track down the attackers. Israel’s Prime Minister called the attack an act of terrorism in every respect. It is unacceptable. We have officially defined it as terrorism. We will fight terrorism, we will defeat terrorism, we will bring the perpetrators of this atrocity to justice. But Palestinian leaders blamed the Israeli government directly for the killing, and the expansion of settlements which has been declared illegal under international law. They point to seems like this earlier in the week, Israeli police fighting ultranationalists. The Israeli government said it opposed the court order to destroy buildings. The protest that took space reflects the culture of hate and incitement that exists and is nourished by the Israeli government. We hold the government of Israel fully responsible for this new crime of the occupation. Around his small grave, hundreds of people have been morning 18-month-old Ali at his funeral. Amid fears this murder could provoke more violence. A piece of aircraft debris, found yesterday on the island of Reunion in the Indian Ocean, is being taken to France to be examined by investigators. Australian experts say they are increasingly confident that the wreckage IS associated with the missing Malaysian airliner MH370. Our correspondent Milton Nkosi reports from Reunion. The mystery of Malaysian Flight MH370 may be close to being solved. Experts say the debris here on Reunion Island may well be that of the missing plane. We are becoming increasingly confident that it is associated with that 777 aircraft, and it is therefore very likely that it is associated with MH370. And there is no record of if it is the part, it is becoming increasingly clear it is, there is no other recorded case of this part being lost on a 777 aircraft. Malaysian officials are en route to Reunion, and they anticipate some answers. TRANSLATION: Not only us, but the whole world wants to know what happened to MH370. We don’t know how long it will take to identify. And so preparations are underway here for the debris to be flown to France for verification. The wing is here at the airport. But we went to Saint-Andre, on the beach where the wreckage story began. johnny Begue is the gardener for the local council, and he found the wreckage. TRANSLATION: The round thing was facing the ocean and as the waves were coming up, they were washing up the debris. We’ve pulled it up onto land. I thought immediately of the families. They were grieving. It is the sheer power of the South Equatorial current that brings much debris to this island. There is no knowing where it comes from. As the police continue to scour the beach for more clues, no one knows what the Indian Ocean could reveal next.

The Chinese capital, Beijing, was up against the Kazakh city of Almaty. A little earlier, the winner was announced by the President of the International Olympic Committee, Thomas Bach. The International Olympic Committee has the honour to announce the host city of the Olympic Winter games, 2022... Beijing! CHEERING AND APPLAUSE. FANFARE. Our Correspondent john Sudworth is in Beijing for us. A lot of people are asking, does it’s no much there? -- A lot of people are asking, does it’s no much there? -- does it smell? It doesn’t, and that is one of the criticisms people are levelling -- of the criticisms people are levelling -- it does not snow much. It is an already dry chicken area. A couple of hours ago, this square in front of the birds nest stadium was full of exuberant celebrations, but it would be wrong to call them spontaneous. They were special cheering troops busting for the occasion while others were kept outside. Critics would say that sums UP outside. Critics would say that sums up Beijing’s bid, well funded, but with a covering democratic deficit, the other concern being the Communist Party’s human rights record and the idea that it has got worse, not better, since the 2008 Olympics. But China says these games will lead to a great economic boost and lead to development in regions that needed badly and they say it will introduce 1.3 billion people to winter sports, leaving an extraordinary sporting legacy. The five-month public inquiry into the death of Alexander Litvinenko is drawing to a close nearly eight years after he was poisoned with the highly radioactive substance Polonium 210. Ben Emmerson QC, acting for the Litvinenko family, told the inquiry that when the evidence is viewed in the round, as it must be, it establishes Russian state responsibility for Alexander Litvinenko’s murder beyond reasonable doubt. And if the Russian State is responsible, he said, Vladimir Putin is responsible. Gordon Corera is at the Royal Courts ofjustice. The stakes The sta kes couldn’t is right. After months, today was the end of evidence into the inquiry into one of the most dramatic murders in recent British history, the killing of Alexander Litvinenko, a former Russian spy turned British citizen, killed with radioactive polonium in 2006. This morning, the lawyerfor radioactive polonium in 2006. This morning, the lawyer for his widow Marina summed up the case against two Russians and said that behind them lay the Kremlin. Alexander Litvinenko, a fierce critic of the Kremlin, died a slow deathin critic of the Kremlin, died a slow death in the London hospital bed in 2006, poisoned by radioactive polonium. Today, the lawyer for his widow told the inquiry who he thought was responsible. The evidence has demonstrated, step by painstaking step, that Putin and his personal cabal are directly located in organised crime, that they are willing to murder those who stand in their way and that Mr Litvinenko was murdered for that reason. Police believe these two men were responsible. Both deny it. The evidence for that comes from a radioactive trail they left during their trips to London. The trail matched the movements of the two men from a sushi bar by Mayfair office where they made their first attempt to poison, and finally to the Pine bar of the millennium hotel. This CCTV shows the two men at the millennium Hotel. Alexander Litvinenko arrives soon after and drink a cup of tea with them. This police graphic shows in darker colours the areas of radioactive contamination on the teapot used. As the inquiry ended, Marina Litvinenko gave her reaction. I believe the truth has finally been uncovered. The murderers and their paymasters have been unmasked. Even though some of its evidence has been heard in secret, nearly nine years after that meeting, this inquiry has revealed much about Alexander Litvinenko’s life and death. So now the chairman of the inquiry will write a report, which he will hand to the Home Secretary and which is expected to be published by the end of the year. The conclusions about the role of Russia and the Kremlin will be central and the most closely read part of that report. Zimbabwe’s called for the American dentist who killed Cecil the lion to be extradited to face justice there. The White House has said it will consider sending Walter Palmer back to the country. A professional hunter has been charged with failing to prevent an illegal hunt, which he denies, and prosecutors are deciding on the exact charges the landowner should face. Criminals who traffic people or force them into slave labour will face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment from today, as key parts of the Modern Day Slavery Act come into force across England and Wales. The Home Office says there could be up to 13,000 people being held as slaves in the UK, as our correspondent Sarah Campbell reports. Far from being a dark chapter in history, slavery remains a modern-day scourge. Emma, not her real name, says she was forced into prostitution in Albania and trafficked across Europe. I couldn’t escape because I was locked. There was always a person around me. i WGS I’1âVâI’ 3loIâ1â. I think about it, but I didn’t have choice or opportunity, how to do it. I was scared that if I do it and he’s around, I can escape by myself, but he can do something to my family. Eventually, she did escape and sought help here in the UK. More than 2,500 victims of modern slavery have been helped in safe houses like this over the past four years. But even so, there are many more who fear reprisals and even that they themselves could be seen as the criminal. The Modern Slavery Act increases the maximum sentence for the worst offenders from 14 years to life in prison. It encourages courts to seize their assets and compensate victims, and gives access to legal aid for those who need it. There is a strong hope in this sector that the Modern Slavery Bill will make a difference to the number of convictions, and that is really important, because it is widespread. The Salvation Army has received increasing numbers of referrals over the past four years since we have had the contract. But there are still lots of victims who aren’t discovered. Do you feel safe now? Yes. I am, I think. What help have you been given in here? They give me support and everything. My life changed since I’ve been here, still. The new act is the first of its kind in Europe and the message to victims is, according to the Home Office, you are not alone. Cricket, and England are chasing victory on just day three of the third Ashes test in Birmingham. They want to bowl Australia out cheaply, but it’s not been easy. Our sports correspondent joe Wilson joins us now from Edgbaston. Yes, Iam Yes, I am -- patients seems a lost art at times, but England have needed it and they will be satisfied with their progress. You could say they have completed phase one as they try to get to a victory here today. Having bowled Australia all outjust before lunch for 265. Don’t hang around - this game had stretched into Friday, but no one arriving in the morning you quite how much cricket to expect. But do you measure a match by the days in a test, or by the tests in a day? England’s firstjob was test, or by the tests in a day? England’s first job was to end the Australian second innings as promptly as possible. Every near miss, every boundary increased both Australia’s lead and simultaneously England’s anxiety. Peter Neville, a controversial selection in his own way, got 250. Worse friendly and was being tail-ender Mitchell Starc riding his luck. When the ball flies through a space where a field may have stood, it’s a challenge to stay positive. Testing. Great catch by wicketkeeperjos Buttler, but what had the ball touched? Not out, said the Empire, as England pondered and near miss, the captain knew he did not have a star bowler to call on. james Anderson is injured. Cook will have to do without him in the next test as well, a big miss. Now, jos Buttler leaping again, catching again. This time, alt. Neville gone, Australia eight down, 72 runs ahead. England are still searching for another perfect delivery, or at least something surprising. Keep a sense of humour. Start slogging. Where was that going? Catch? Know, six. That brought up his 50 and Australia led by 100. In times of trouble, time and again England have relied onjoe Root. What a catch, Hazelwood gone. The more you see it, the more you wonder how on earth he held it. At 12.44 it ended. Catch by substitute fielder all out, and England’s batsmen need 121 to win the match. They have started their second innings and will resume shortly. In the next hour, I am sure we will see Mitchelljohnson strain every tattooed sinew. If England survived that, surely they will win. It’s the size of six football pitches and cost £15m to build, and now the world’s longest man-made surf wave is ready to ride. At the touch of a button, ten foot waves are created - at an old aluminium works on the edge of the Snowdonia National Park. Claire Marshall has been to try it out. A year ago, we came to north Wales and saw these dismal remains of an old aluminium works. And look at it now. This quiet valley on the edge of the Snowdonia National Park is FIOW B vast l8gooI’I. The size of six football pitches, it is filled with 6 million gallons of rainwater, and peeling across it is the largest man-made surf wave in the world. To have a wave every 60 seconds at your fingertips in the Welsh summer is fantastic. The technology is highly secret, and works like a powerful underwater snowplow, forcing the water out either side. When the factory here closed a decade ago, the heart of the little village was ripped out. Rita jones is 62, and she has lived here since she was born. How is business? Business is great. Isn’t it? I’m having my surfing lesson on Saturday at one o’clock. The hardest bit about surfing is that first sort of learning stage, when people can get discouraged. This fast forwards that very quickly. So anyone can get up? Anyone can get up. Even Rita and I? I have surfed a bit, but nowhere like this. Come on, take a step forward. That was good. It cost £15 million to bring the waves here, and we are being allowed to test it out before it is opened to the public. Exhilarating! You didn’t fall off? No, I didn’t fall off. Not quite standing up, but... No, not quite, next time maybe. It is a mechanical creation, very different from being in the ocean. It is really odd surfing straight towards that metal structure, but it is brilliant. Especially in this setting. This science means that surfing could now become an Olympic sport. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Tomasz Schafernaker. Tonight, we have clear skies on the way. So we will get a glimpse of the blue moon. Normally in a calendar month, we get one full moon. If it happens a second time at the end of the month, we call it a blue moon. The next one is in 2018. It is not blue, itjust called blue, and it is not made of blue cheese either. Today, we have some clouds in the sky across the north-west of the entry. This is where they will stay through most of the afternoon. For places like Glasgow and Belfast, it is another cloudy day. A big contrast with central and southern areas, where we have clear skies, which we will keep tonight. You might catch a glimpse of the moon. Temperatures were substantial today. And for the women’s British Open in southwestern parts of Scotland, looks as though we have rain on the way and Sunday will probably bring showers. The rain sinks further south overnight. We have clear skies across southern England. Scotland will have clear skies as well. Not as chilly as last night. On Saturday, we are expecting things to warm up across the south-east, but it may end up being cloudy. So don’t be surprised if across central and southern parts of the country, it does cloud over a bit. For example, for the women’s FA Cup final, it is warm, but it will be overcast for a time. Then we have the cycling in London, a lot of Lycra clad people cycling around. Temperatures will be steamy by ",,

And Scotland’s Premiership football season prepares for kick-off. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. David Cameron has warned that the migrant crisis in Calais will last all summer, as he announced that extra sniffer dogs and fencing will be sent to the French port. Those measures have been dismissed as ‘sticking plasters’ by the haulage industry. Services through the Channel Tunnel are again severely delayed after hundreds of migrants tried to enter it overnight. For 26 of the last A2 days, the coast-bound side of the M20 in Kent has been closed, so that lorries can park. The cost of policing what’s known as Operation Stack is £700,000 for the last three weeks alone. Both police and social services in Kent say they’re struggling to cope. Robert Hall reports from there. Athin line A thin line of protection on the outskirts of Calais and a vivid illustration of why this route to the UK is so hard to police. The reinforcements sent by the French government have joined colleagues trying to close the gaps in a huge security perimeter. Hundreds of migrants, moving in small groups, simply cannot be effectively contained as they search for a new way through. A small number make it every day, this picture taken at Folkestone captures two men clinging to the roof of a lorry as it left the terminal. Today the government’s Cobra emergency committee agreed further measures to bolster the security operation in Calais. More dogs, to make sure there is 21+-hour cover, more fencing, more resources and more policing if necessary. All the things that can be done will be done to stop people illegally entering our country and to make the situation better for the lorry drivers and holiday-makers who face delays. On this side of the channel Operation Stack rolled on. There had been some improvement overnight, but drivers still faced a weight of several hours before they could reach the time will all the Port of Dover. In Maidstone and the transport Minister, police and highway officers met to thresh out possible solutions as the County ended another week with transport links disrupted and businesses losing money.

Now he is considering a move to London, which would put 16jobs that -- at risk. We are getting two or three customers a week, we may need to change location. There is no sign of the evening out, then we would have to look fraught evidence. During several hours of talks at County Hall the central issue has been how to move... Sorry. During several hours of talks here at County Hall, the central issue has been how to move queueing lorries off the motorway network and dust free up routes to and from the coast. We need the trucks to keep moving towards the port because that is the exceptional stuff if we can get them out of the county we can free up the roads in the county. It is a question of how we manage those flows in the optimum manner. One solution would be to use the giant car parks at Ebbsfleet station. Traffic is expected to ease over the weekend but even the smallest incident in Calais could tip the balance once again. For the fourth consecutive night, migrants have jumped over fences and climbed onto lorries and trains heading through the Channel tunnel. French police say more than a thousand attempts were made last night to break through police lines at the terminal. From Calais, here’s Lucy Williamson. For many of Calais’ migrants the toughest border in a 3,000 mile journey starts with this fence. Beyond it, and several other fences are the tracks leading into the Channel Tunnel. After a sharp drop in incursions on Wednesday, the numbers have spiked again. Police say they caught migrants on the site 1,000 times last night. TRANSLATION: The police are exhausted. They are getting sick, and some have stopped turning up for work. It is affecting them psychologically, and they feel like they cannot go on. The governments, of both countries, need to find the solution. The main migrant camp is six miles from the Eurotunnel’s site. It is the size of a major airport, and has 14 miles of perimeter fence. The new British fence will protect trucks on the platforms inside the terminal. Extra barriers and sniffer dogs to reinforce the perimeter have also just been offered. Today another layer of disruption was added to Calais’ landscape. Ferry workers, employed by Eurotunnel protesting the closing of its ferry service. This is the entry road to Calais’ ferry port. For the protesters here, this is an industrial dispute, but for the migrants, it is another chance to get into the UK, and you can see the lorries are backed up all the way along this road. So, confronted with sniffer dogs, security fencing and riot police, what are migrants here planning to do? In the main camp, known as ‘the jungle’, they are building mosques, community centres and a school. No-one is showing any signs of leaving. Even if they put army, we are going to pass. Even if England give to France a lot of money to build these things, and they put fire, lions and scorpions in front, we are going to pass, because God brings us here.

Our Political Correspondent Eleanor Garnier is in Westminster for us now. How important is it for the Prime Minister to be seen to be strong on this issue? It is essential he is notjust seem to be strong but he gets a grip on the crisis in Calais and Kent. That is why less than two hours after he got back from his tourin hours after he got back from his tour in south-east Asia he was chairing that government emergency committee, getting on with the job but also trying to show he is on the front foot. Yes, he has promised more sniffer dogs and pledged to find land to create lorry parks to ease the pressure on the M20 and significantly he has offered to reinforce the ten mile perimeter stretch of the Channel Tamil. I am told that will be at whatever cost. Tonight he will talk to Francois Hollande and it is important he works closely, notjust with the French president but also other European leaders. -- Channel Tunnel. David Cameron knows none of the measures he has announced today will go anyway to address the much more complex problem of the flow of migrants across Europe from North Africa and the Middle East. Thank you. It’s being described as a gamechanger in the fight against Ebola. Initial results of a vaccine trial in Guinea are exciting and promising, according to the World Health Organisation. The Wellcome Trust, which helped to develop the drug, said it hopes the breakthrough will help end the epidemic. Sophie Hutchinson reports. Backin Back in April in Guinea trials of the new Ebola vaccine were under way, no one yet knew the breakthrough this would come. Today it was described as a potential game changer by the World Health Organisation. Scientists described their delight at what seemed to be the vaccine’s success. This vaccine is effective in preventing Ebola, very effective it seems from the preliminary results. It is extremely significant, just from that point of view. Preliminary results published in the Lancet show 100% success rate in protecting those given the vaccine without delay, for others vaccination was delayed for three weeks and resulted in a small number of Ebola cases. They were all friends, family and close colleagues of Ebola patients. The aim was to protect them and stop the virus spreading. It is known as a green strategy. It was also used as a ring vaccination, the idea of vaccinating around cases. So it seems that that strategy is also very effective. The Ebola epidemic started in Guinea at the beginning of last year and quickly spread across West Africa. At its height it seemed unstoppable, more than 27,000 people were infected and more than 11,000 have died. But the latest figures show there were just seven cases last week, the lowest since the outbreak started. The World Health Organisation, however, is clearthat there will be another outbreak, so this vaccine will be key in fighting it. This has been the most deadly occurrence of Ebola and the World Health Organisation has been heavily criticised for a slow response. Today it said it needed more money to fight any future epidemic. One is to support the scaling up of the international response, and two is to build response capacities in vulnerable countries. And it is hoped faster drug development will also be part of that response. It took under one year to create this vaccine, which should now protect communities from this deadly virus. The Home Secretary Theresa May has apologised to the dissident Chinese artist, Ai Wei-Wei, after his visa application was refused. Mr Ai was told he hadn’t declared a criminal conviction on his application, but though he’s been detained in China, he’s never been charged with an offence. He’s now been granted a 6 month visa for the UK, which means he’ll be here when the Chinese President visits in October. From today, criminals who traffic people, or force them into slave labour, face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, as key parts of the Modern Day Slavery Act come into force across England and Wales. The Home Office says there could be up to 13,000 people being held as slaves in the UK. A light aircraft has crashed into a car auction warehouse in Hampshire. It was said to burst into flames on impact when it crashed near Blackbushe airport. Our Correspondent Ben Moore is there for us now. What do we know about what happened? At British car auction you can see there where that tree line is. About 3:10pm this afternoon plane crashed into the site. We know it was a free number 300 jet and there were people on board and it was attempting to make a landing here. The warehouse was evacuated here, but an eyewitness said the plane hit parked cars like these, that waiting just behind me. The plume of smoke it produced could be seen from about five miles away. The ambulance they are initial reports suggest that our four casualties, although we do not know as yet, what state and condition they are in. The air accident investigation Branch is aware and has begun an investigation. Thank you. Our top story this evening: David Cameron warns that the migrant crisis in Calais could last all summer.

A piece of aircraft debris, found yesterday on the island of Reunion in the Indian Ocean, is being taken to France to be examined by investigators. Australian experts say they are increasingly confident that the wreckage is associated with the missing Malaysian airliner MH370. The Boeing 777 vanished in March last year, with 239 passengers and crew on board. Our correspondent Karen Allen reports from Reunion. Scouring the shoreline, this coastal paradise could unlock the secrets of the deep and help to reveal the mysteries of a flight that simply vanished 16 months ago. Debris washed up on the beach here on Reunion Island now confirmed by Malaysia ministers as being a chunk of wing from a Boeing 777. This evening at the main airport, they were preparing to fly the plane component onto France where crash investigators will examine it more closely. As they await the precious cargo, there isjust one question. Is this the first physical evidence of missing flight MH370? This is one of those aboard. She was married with two daughters. For them, finding debris could be the key to understanding what happened. I suppose it would be some form of closure at least, which is better than nothing. At the same time, we do not think that it should end there. We think that all that will say is, this is where you need to look because we still need to know how and why it happened. It is important to prevent similar incidents in the future. A world away, anxious for information, the man who discovered the piece of wreckage. He was out on his rounds on the island again today. TRANSLATION: I thought immediately of the families. They were grieving. They do not know what happened. If it really is from that plane, they will perhaps be happy and sad at the same time. Because they lost their loved ones, but now they will have closure. We are thousands of miles away from the original search site and up here, you can really appreciate the challenges that investigators face. But another find, another possible piece of plane wreckage could hold vital clues and help piece together the mystery of what happened to flight MH370. After a dramatic few days, this tiny part of the Indian Ocean has taken on new significance. No-one is taking the sea and its treasures for granted. A cyclist who knocked down a toddler and dragged her along a pavement has pleaded guilty to dangerous cycling. Andrew Holland, who’s 24 and from Blackpool, collided with 3 year old Lucie Wilding as she stepped out of her family’s front gate. judith Moritz was in court. Watch this footage closely, as a toddler is swept off her feet by a passing cyclist. When we slow it down, you can see the little girl as she leaves her front gate, and is caught in the pedals before being dragged along the pavement. Fearing the worst, Lucy Wilding’s parents rushed her to hospital. There was just blood all down the side of her face. She was just screaming, she was just screaming. It was awful, she was hysterical. All she was doing was stepping out of her front gate. Neverfor one minute would I ever think that a cyclist would hit my daughter on the pavement. Andrew Holland was ordered to pay more than £800 for cycling dangerously. Any apology to make at all, Mr Holland? I have already made an apology and written to the family. The family say he has not said sorry. He made no further comment. Take that, and shove it. Lucy’s parents say their daughter is still traumatised. We were at the park with her yesterday, weren’t we? And she was anxious of children on their bikes, it is not necessarilyjust adults now. Three-year-old Lucy may not grow up to remember the accident, but her parents are unlikely ever to forget it. Vladimir Putin personally ordered the murder of Alexander Litvinenko, according to the lawyer representing the former Russian spy’s family. Speaking at the inquiry into his death, Ben Emmerson QC said Russian state responsibility had been proved beyond reasonable doubt. Our Security Correspondent Gordon Corera is at the Royal Courts ofjustice. Yes, today, after months of hearings, the public enquiry finished hearing evidence into this most dramatic and diplomatically contentious of murders, the killing of a former Russian spy turned British citizen by radioactive poison on the streets of London. Alexander Litvinenko, a fierce critic of the Kremlin, who died an agonising death in a London hospital, killed by radioactive polonium. Today, his Wood Hill told me who she held responsible. -- his widow. It is not as simple as two guys who came to London and killed mY guys who came to London and killed my husband. They are all linked to the security service, to their paymasters. It all comes up to the Kremlin. These two men, Dmitri caught and Andre Lavoie, are alleged to have come to London to carry out the murder but both deny it. -- Dmitri ten seam. Polonium was described at the enquiry is almost a perfect murder weapon. Almost because once the police identified it, they could follow a radioactive trail of evidence. The trial matches the movements of the two suspects exactly including their flights in and out of Heathrow and hotels they stayed in, including one where the poison was spilled in a bathroom. Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium, where they watch the game. Andy Mayfair office where an initial attempt to poison Litvinenko was made. The fatal dose came at the millennium hotel. This CCTV footage shows the alleged killersjust before they met Litvinenko. This police graphic shows the bar where they sat. Green shows contamination and purple the highest level. On their seats and on the actual the real question is who gave the orders and why. Today, Marina Litvinenko’s lawyer had his answer. The evidence has demonstrated step-by-step that Putin and his personal cabal are directly located in organised crime. That they are willing to murder those who stand in their way, and that Mr Litvinenko was murdered for that reason. It has taken nearly nine years since Alexander Litvinenko’s death to get to this point. The judge who cheered the enquiry says that he will report by the end of the year, and the Kremlin has dismissed the whole process and denied any involvement. An 18 month old Palestinian boy has been killed in an arson attack, believed to have been carried out by jewish settlers in the West Bank. The Israeli government has described it as a barbaric act of terrorism. james Robbins has this report. As the Palestinian family slept inside, fire bombs were thrown into their home. Father, mother and four-year-old Ahmed managed to get out, with horrible burns, but they and their neighbours in the village of Douma could not save Ali Saad Dawabsha, 18 months old. Israeli settlers have been blamed. The attackers sprayed the word ""Revenge"" in Hebrew on a wall, under the Star of David. The Israeli security forces say they will track down the attackers. Israel’s Prime Minister called the attack an attack of terrorism in every respect. We are shocked, we are outraged. We condemn this. There is zero tolerance for terrorism wherever it comes from. Whatever side of the fence it comes from, we have to fight it. And fight it together. But Palestinian leaders blame the Israeli government directly for the killing, as well as the expansion of settlements, declared illegal under international law. They point to scenes like this earlier in the week. Israeli police did fight ultra-nationalist jewish settlers to enforce a court order ordering demolition of two part-completed buildings. But the Israeli government said it opposed the court order. The brutal assassination that took place reflects the culture of hate and incitement that exists and is nourished by the Israeli government. We hold the government of Israel responsible for this new crime of the occupation. Hundreds of people have been mourning 18-month-old Ali, pressing around his small body wrapped in the Palestinian flag, amid fears that this murder could provoke further violence. Zimbabwe’s government has called for the extradition of an American dentist accused of shooting Cecil the lion - a protected animal who was living in a national park. Walter Palmer has expressed regret about the killing, saying he believed the hunt was legal. Meanwhile, an Oxford University conservation project that was monitoring Cecil says it’s raised £300,000 in donations since his death. England have completed a comprehensive 8 wicket victory overAustralia, in the third ashes test in Birmingham. Their win inside three days is a remarkable turnaround in fortune after Australia’s dominant victory at Lord’s. Our sports correspondent joe Wilson has the story of the day. There’s some flash photography in his report. Don’t hang around, this game had stretched into Friday but nobody arriving in the morning knew how much cricket to expect. Do you measure a match by the days in a Test, or by the tests in a day? England’s first task was to end the Australian second innings as promptly as possible. Every near miss and boundary increased Australia’s lead and simultaneously England’s anxiety. Peter Nevill on 59, Buttler, held, Australia eight down, 72 ahead. Starc slugging, where was it going? Catch, no, six. It brought up his 50, Australia leading by 100. England can rely on Root, Hazelwood gone, the more you see it, the more you wonder how he held it. At 12.44 the innings ended, Starc caught by the substitute fielder. Australia allowed for 265. -- all out. Phase one. With lunch done, England were batting. just 121 runs in the second innings to win the match. just 121? Plenty of time for nerves, especially when Cook went for seven, Ian Bell decided to dare, and he won. Adam Lyth fell but confidence grew around the ground. Ian Bell, a second 50 in the match, personal resilience. joe Root, direct Root. Remember England were pummelled in the last test, they passed this one with flying colours, victory and the figures which really matter, in the Ashes England lead 2-1 with two matches to come. Alastair Cook as challenge Trent Bridge to be as noisy as Edgbaston next week. jimmy Anderson will miss that their industry. In my view, I think they have earned the right to worry about that in the morning. -- miss that through injury. A baby sloth whose mother couldn’t look after him has found an unusual surrogate pa re nt. 7 week-old Edward, who lives at London Zoo, was given a teddy bear from the gift shop, after his mother stopped producing milk and was unable to care for him. Zookeepers were worried about his lack of strength - but he’s building up muscles by climbing across the teddy’s back, as he would have done with his mum. Let’s take a look at the weather. It is merely the weekend. Here isjohn Hammond. Yes it is. As we go into the weekend, we going to August but a quick look back at Szalai, running hot and cold. The 1st ofjuly, 37 degrees in southern England. Infact it was the warmest, hottest july day on record. Compare that with last night, 1 degrees in southern England. The coldestjuly night. But we are into August, or very nearly, and the result worrying trend. Rain pushing into north-western Scotland. One or two sharp bursts on either side. Not as cold as last night for much of us -- most of us but in rural spots, three degrees possible. Chilly under clear skies. This weather front, still with rain on it, stretching into parts of Wales. Sharp bursts within that. Dry on either side. Wherever you are, there is a good chance that at some stage you will see sunshine, certainly for Scotland, but here, you will see sharp showers. Maybe a rumble of thunder. But sunshine in between. Northern Ireland sees some fine weather. Northern England will cheer up, with sunshine. But that zone of showers will linger in the South. The Southeast and East Anglia, holding onto sunshine. Getting pretty warm as well. As we go from Saturday into Sunday, everything heads north words, meaning rain for Northern Ireland, pushing into Scotland. A disappointing day here. For England and Wales, things brightening up by contrast. Potentially up into the high 20s. jane.

Late on BBC London News: Demare claims a third runway at Heathrow would mean a cut in connections to the rest of the UK. And then met denies claims its officers refused to help a drowning teenager. Good evening. David Cameron has warned that the migrant crisis in Calais will last all summer - as he offered to have extra sniffer dogs and fencing sent to the French port. Those measures were dismissed as ‘sticking plasters’ by the haulage industry. Services through the Channel Tunnel have again been severely delayed, after hundreds of migrants tried to enter it overnight. For 26 of the last A2 days, the coast-bound side of the M20 in Kent has been closed, so that lorries can park there. The cost of policing what’s known as Operation Stack is £700,000 for the last three weeks alone. Both police and social services in Kent say they’re struggling to cope - as Robert Hall reports. A thin line of protection on the outskirts of Calais, and a vivid illustration of why this route to the UK is so hard to police. The reinforcements sent by the French government have joined colleagues trying to close the gaps in a huge security perimeter. Hundreds of migrants moving in small groups simply can’t be effectively contained as they search for a new way through. A small number make it every day. This picture, taken at Folkestone, captures two men clinging to the roof of a lorry as it left the terminal. Today, the Government’s Cobra emergency committee agreed further measures to bolster the security operation in Calais. More dogs, to make sure there’s 2l+-hour cover, and more fencing, more resources, more policing if necessary. All the things that can be done will be done to stop people illegally entering our country and to make the situation better for the lorry drivers and holiday-makers who face potential delays. On this side of the Channel, Operation Stack rolled on. There had been some improvement overnight, but drivers still faced a wait of several hours before they could reach the tunnel or the Port of Dover. In Maidstone, the transport minister, council officials, police and highways officers met to thrash out possible solutions as the county ended another week with transport links disrupted and businesses losing money. The A20 is blocked, the A2 is blocked, the small roads are blocked, villages are blocked. People can’t get to their hospital appointments. There was a lady who was desperately worried that she won’t get to the hospital to have her baby. It is as bad as that. Polish that a little bit more on that side. Tony O’Donnell has run his bathroom business near Ashford for 25 years. Now he’s considering a move to London, which would put 16 jobs at risk. We get two or three customers a day. At the moment, we’re getting two or three a week. We may have to open another facility in another location. If this persists, and there’s no sign of it evening out, we would have to look at alternatives. One issue has dominated the hours of talks at County Hall today - how to move the queues of waiting lorries off the M20 and thus free up routes to and from the coast. We need the trucks to keep moving towards the port, because that’s the exit. If we can get them out of the county, we can free up the roads in the county. It’s a question of how we manage those flows through the Channel Tunnel and the Port of Dover in the optimum manner. One solution would be to use the giant car parks at Ebbsfleet station as a holding area. Freight traffic is expected to ease over the weekend, but even the smallest incident in Calais could tip the balance once again. Robert Hall, BBC News, Kent. For the fourth consecutive night, migrantsjumped over fences and climbed onto lorries and trains heading through the tunnel. French police say more than 1,000 attempts were made to break through police lines at the terminal yesterday. From Calais, here’s Lucy Williamson. For many of Calais’ migrants the toughest border in a 3,000 mile journey starts with this fence. Beyond it, and several other fences are the tracks leading into the Channel Tunnel. After a sharp drop in incursions on Wednesday, the numbers have spiked again. Police say they caught migrants on the site 1,000 times last night. TRANSLATION: The police are exhausted. They are getting sick, and some have stopped turning up for work. It is affecting them psychologically, and they feel like they cannot go on. The governments, of both countries, need to find the solution. The main migrant camp is six miles from the Eurotunnel’s site. It is the size of a major airport, and has 14 miles of perimeter fence. The new British fence will protect trucks on the platforms inside the terminal. Extra barriers and sniffer dogs to reinforce the perimeter have also just been offered. Today another layer of disruption was added to Calais’ landscape. Ferry workers, employed by Eurotunnel protesting the closing of its ferry service. This is the entry road to Calais’ ferry port. For the protesters here, this is an industrial dispute, but for the migrants, it is another chance to get into the UK, and you can see the lorries are backed up all the way along this road. So, confronted with sniffer dogs, security fencing and riot police, what are migrants here planning to do? In the main camp, known as The jungle, they are building mosques, community centres and a school. No one is showing any signs of leaving. Even if they put army, we are going to pass. Even if England give to France a lot of money to build these things, and they put fire, lions and scorpions in front, we are going to pass, because God brings us here. Nowjust 15 miles from their chosen homeland, English speakers from former colonies’ current conflicts. Why, they ask, won’t Britain let them in? Lucy Williamson, BBC News, Calais. Our political correspondent Eleanor Garnier is in Downing Street - Eleanor, David Cameron is keen to be seen to be getting on top of this? He has spoken to Francois Hollande tonight, has anything emerged from that? I understand they had a constructive conversation, they shared their concerns about security issues and that offered to reinforce the whole perimeter friends of the Channel Tunnel at Coquelles has been accepted by the French. But David Cameron needs to work closely not just with the French but with other European leaders too, because he knows that none of the new measures he announced today will tackle the much more comics issue of the flow of migrants across Europe from North Africa and the Middle East. David Cameron has faced criticism that his ministers have been complacent, that the Government hasn’t helped enough and has not been quick enough to help. Today, though, we saw the Prime Minister getting on with the job, trying to be seen to be taking control getting can hold of the credit is in Kent and Calais and showing he’s on the front foot. Eleanor Garnier, thank you. It’s being described as a gamechanger in the fight against Ebola. Initial results of a vaccine trial in Guinea are promising and exciting, according to the World Health Organisation. The Wellcome Trust, which helped to develop the drug, said it hopes the breakthrough will help end the epidemic. Sophie Hutchinson reports.

And it’s hoped that faster drug development will also be part of that response. It took under a year to create this vaccine, which should now protect communities from this deadly virus.

Karen Allen, BBC News, on the Indian Ocean’s Reunion island. The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, has described an arson attack which killed an 18 month old boy in the West Bank as a war crime. The attack has been blamed onjewish settlers. Israel’s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, called it an act of terrorism. Our correspondent, jonny Dymond reports from the village of Duma in the West Bank. The fire came as the family slept. The mother, father and a four-year-old son escaped, although with terrible injuries, but the flames took Ali Dawabsheh, a toddler, just 18 months old. On a building, graffiti in Hebrew left by the killers. ""Revenge"", it says, beneath the Star of David. We tried to help the boy and we cannot help. There is a boy inside the fire, just three or four metres in front of you and you cannot do anything. We feel very weak, very sad. This was almost certainly a political killing. This graffiti and the attacks that go with them are known as ""price tags"". They are a message from extreme nationalists to the Israeli government. The nationalists are saying there’s a price to pay for the government’s refusal to expand Israeli settlements on Palestinian territory. The price that was paid today was an 18-month-old life. Visiting two of the survivors of the attack this afternoon, mother and son, both badly burned, the Israeli prime minister was quick to describe the attack as terrorism. We are shocked, we are outraged. We condemn this. There is a zero tolerance for terrorism. Wherever it comes from, whichever side of the fence it comes from, we have to fight it, and fight it together. But Palestinians, who demonstrated following the attack, tell a different story. They say that Israeli government policy has encouraged settler violence. The brutal assassination that took place reflects the culture of hate and incitement that exists and is nourished by the Israeli government. We hold the government of Israel fully responsible. Ali Dawabsheh was buried just hours after the fire, already a martyr to those who carried his tiny coffin. jonny Dymond, BBC News, jerusalem.

A huge fireball at a small private airfield in Hampshire. At 3:10pm as it landed, this executive jet crashed. All four on board died, three passengers and the pilot. The dense plume of smoke could be seen for miles. Investigators say they want to hear from anyone who saw what happened. No one on the ground has been injured and we would urge anyone with any information, including pictures or videos, to contact 101 and ask for Operation Cale. The plane was a Phenom 300 jet.

Ben Moore, BBC News, Hampshire. In Egypt there’s been a disturbing increase in the number of people going missing at the hands of the security services, according to human rights activists. One Egyptian campaign group says in two months it recorded 163 cases of so called ""enforced disappearances"". Most of those people were later found in custody. Campaigners say the disappearances, which violate international law, are part of the worst human rights crackdown in decades. From Cairo, here’s Orla Guerin. A slick video from Egypt’s security services. Weapons allegedly captured from a terror cell. These are the accused. Campaigners say several had disappeared before their starring role here. Among them, this student, who confesses, voluntarily or otherwise,to buying a gun. He went missing injune on an evening out with these two friends. The 23-year-old woman was in the middle of her sociology exams. Her bedroom is now a place of sorrow. Relatives searched for two weeks before finding her in prison, facing terrorism charges. They say she has difficulty walking since being shot at a protest last year. They claim she is innocent and it’s the security forces who are breaking the law.

This was the funeral for a student who vanished after sitting his finals in May. One day later, his bullet-ridden body was found in the morgue. The Interior Ministry claims he was involved in the killing of a security official. It says he opened fire on police, who tracked him a desert hideout. But this professor, who graded his exam paper after his death, has seen CCTV footage which suggests the student was grabbed right outside the university. He went out the gate normally and went to the right. Right after one minute, he went in the opposite direction, to the left. There were two men going after him. just before he went out of camera range, they started to run after him and it was clearly the beginning of the chase. Human rights activists say both Islamists and liberals have been snatched from the streets, as Egypt returns to all-out repression. We couldn’t get a response from the government to the allegations that growing numbers are disappearing at the hands of the security forces, but officials recently dismissed the claims as lies. They said they don’t use these tactics and if anyone has any proof they should file a complaint. Orla Guerin, BBC News, Cairo. The Home Secretary, Theresa May, has apologised to the Chinese artist, Ai Wei-Wei, after his visa application was refused. He was told he’d failed to declare a criminal conviction, even though he’s never been charged with an offence in China. He’s now been granted a six-month visa, which means he’ll be in the UK when the Chinese President visits in October. Tomorrow sees the highlight of the domestic season in women’s football, the FA Cup final. A record crowd is expected to watch Chelsea play Notts County at Wembley Stadium, which is hosting the final for the first time. It follows on from England’s best ever performance in a World Cup, in Canada. So can the women’s game maintain the momentum and increase its fan base? We’ve asked three key people in the sport for their views. Yes, she has! England lead 1-0. Obviously, the World Cup has done a massive favour for English football. And to be back here and playing, I think it has proved that we have so many more people coming to watch and so much more support. Obviously it has been televised a lot more. The World Cup was televised really, really well. Heel kicks now. OK, and turn. Keep going another way. That’s it. I think there’s been a huge amount of interest, particularly for our club. I mean, we ran trials this year and had over 120 girls apply, which was over double what we had all of last year. Perfection! I think there are three clear things that need to happen now to really build on the legacy, if you will, of the World Cup in Canada. Firstly, I’d like to see more coverage. I’d love to see a regular slot on Match Of The Day. Secondly, I’d like to see more opportunities for girls to play football with girls. And thirdly, I’d like to see more professionalism in the clubs that women play in, more money, more opportunities to make a living playing football, and for women’s football to be treated exactly the same as men’s football. Cricket, and England have beaten Australia by eight wickets to win the third Ashes Test at Edgbaston, and take a commanding 2-1 lead in the series. The home side comfortably reached the winning target of 121 runs on just the third day. joe Wilson was watching. Somewhere in the flurry of embraces on Friday afternoon there was a question at Edgbaston. How did this happen? Well, numerically speaking, England bowled out Australia for 265, after a few fears that they could just extend their lead into tricky territory. Their second innings ended at 12:lIlIpm. That was phase one. Then England batted again. When Cook was out for seven, nerves rattled. England only needed 121 to win. Only! And what if Australian captain Michael Clarke had held on to catch Ian Bell? Well, what ifs did not concern the raucous crowd, including here the, do you think the camera saw us. Ian Bell made his second 50 of the match. Time for that line about class being permanent. Winning runs from joe Root. England, gloriously inconsistent. There was a lot of negativity about our performance last week at Lord’s, which was justified. To bounce back and play as well as that is just down to some character and some good skill. Steven Finn was man of the match. His bowling was outstanding and it might need to be next week at the next Test too, because England will miss james Anderson through injury. Significant? Quite possibly, but England can worry about that at the weekend. joe Wilson, BBC News, at Edgbaston. That’s all from us. Now the news where you are. Welcome to BBC London News - I’m Victoria Hollins.

Formula One now, and Lewis Hamilton delighted the home crowds as he secured pole position for tomorrow’s British Grand Prix at Silverstone. It is Hamilton’s eighth pole in nine races this season. He leads the drivers’ championship by ten points from his Mercedes team-mate, Nico Rosberg, who will start second. Thousands of lightning strikes lit up the skies last night as heavy storms rolled north across much of the country. Viewers have sent us these spectacular pictures of lightning bolts turning night into day as thunder and torrential downpours struck from the south coast to the north of England and swept into Scotland. Despite the ferocity of the storms, there were no reports of damage. There’s more throughout the evening on the BBC News Channel. We are back with the late news at 10:30. Now on BBC One, it’s time for the news where you are. Goodbye. Good evening, I am Asad Ahmad. A stretch of road in south London where the number of deaths and serious injuries being reported is causing frustration among local people who want the layout of the road to change. It is the A23 through Streatham, and Tara Welsh has been to take a look at the problem. It looks like a pedestrian crossing, but this is the junction where the traffic never stops. So what we have to do is keep an eye on that over there, OK, we can run out and try to get over before this lorry. I am not sure how far this is coming. People take their chances as there is nowhere else to cross, but it is risky. And that is a blind corner, so we can’t actually see what is coming round that corner. Let’s try now. The traffic is starting here now. So we go halfway. The blind spot and traffic coming from behind pedestrians means it is no surprise there have been accidents here, some fatal. It seems as if every few days, literally, four orfive days, there is another serious collision, and you know they have happened because all the traffic comes to a complete standstill, you have emergency services coming in to sort it out, and everyone goes on to social media and says, how many more times is this going to happen? What is it going to take until these problems are sorted out? Dave regularly witnesses people caught out here. I think it’s got worse, it’s been dangerous... I mean, I’ve been here 28 years, and I’ve seen lots of accidents and lots of people complaining about the junction. But there are not just concerns here. Further up the road, a reminder of another lost life. Between 2012 and 2014, collisions caused three deaths and 22 serious injuries, along the Streatham stretch of the A23. This is one of the main routes through London, it is 30mph, and there is even a speed camera just behind me. Some local people say that drivers go much, much faster than that, and what makes this road so dangerous is speed. Campaigners want the limit lowered to 20 mph. Everybody drives too quickly along here, and also it is very difficult to get across the road. It is a main road, isn’t it? 30 mph should be reasonable. In the last month, there has been quite a few accidents on this road, so they do need to limit it. Transport for London is in charge of the road and says it has already invested to improve parts of it and is piloting 20 mph zones elsewhere. Campaigners say that won’t protect lives here. Tarah Welsh, BBC London News. A small number of right-wing protesters have been massively outnumbered byjewish supporters in Whitehall this afternoon. The gathering was supposed to take place in Golders Green but was moved to central London after strong objections. It was a protest against a shomrim, which is a jewish neighbourhood watch group. A retired Gurkha soldier in Reading has been reunited with his daughters after a five-year legal battle to be with them. Dambar Margar fought in the Falklands War and now struggles to look after his disabled son after being diagnosed with dementia. A family once more. It is five years since the Margars were all in one country, five long years. The legs that once carried Dambar Margar across the Falklands are a little frailer now. Providing round-the-clock care for his disabled son has also taken its toll. TRANSLATION: I am getting old, and I have health problems. My daughters can support me. In Nepali culture, family is very important, and my daughters are very important, and them being here at last makes me very happy. After a lengthy legal battle, the authorities finally agreed the Margars’ grown-up daughters should be allowed into Britain to help their ageing parents. After like 20 hours’ journey, we were very tired at that time, but finally it all paid off, like after we got to see them, our parents. For the family’s supporters at this Reading based charity, it was a great day also. This is not only a celebration for the family itself. It is a celebration for all the veterans, because they see the gates opening, creaking very slowly open. So this morning, the sisters’ new life began in Reading, a world away from Kathmandu. That’s it for now. We are back on BBC One tomorrow evening. Andy Murray is on Centre Court after the weather forecast. Good evening.

Alongside new photographs, a statement, claiming the family of three generations were ""safer than ever"". The saddest homecoming - the bodies of the final five Britons killed in Tunisia have been returned to the UK. 10 million Greeks prepare to vote in tomorrow’s bail-out referendum - as Europe holds its breath. Ace at Wimbledon - Britain’s Andy Murray makes it through to the final 16 and overcomes an injury scare. Good evening and welcome to BBC News. A family of 12 from Luton who went missing after a trip to Bangladesh are said to be in Syria and have joined so-called Islamic State. A statement issued through IS and showing a new picture of the grandparents says the Mannan family were ""safer than ever"". But in an exclusive interview with the BBC, a friend of one of the brothers says HE would never have joined IS willingly. Our correspondent Nick Beake reports from Luton. Excited British teenagers, filming their adventures on holiday in Bangladesh. But just weeks later, 19-year-old Mohammed Toufique Hussain would apparentlyjoin IS in Syria, along with 11 other members of his family. What is he saying? He is like, just a bit of banter. Back home in Luton, student Nasul Ali told us he cannot believe his best friend would have gone willingly to Syria, as IS have now claimed. We have been mates since high school, junior school, and he would have said bye to all of us properly. I am telling you, he did not know he was going to Syria. Today, IS released photos of the family. Here, 75-year-old Muhammed Abdul Mannanand his wife, Minera, who is thought to have cancer. A statement supposedly on behalf of the family claimed they were feeling as safe as ever in war-torn Syria, and said it was outrageous to suggest the family had been coerced. Some experts believe the latest case of the Mannan family could inspire others and be used as propaganda to recruit not just young fighters but sisters and mothers, too. Now we have seen two families from Britain, and I wonder if that will be a precedent which will inspire other families to go. It is completely plausible and feasible that that might happen. He wouldn’t go, willingly. Nazrull says it makes no sense, but he now fears the worst for his friend. He is not coming back, the fact that I am never going to see his face again - I do not know what to say, to be honest. We also spoke to other people here, who said they, too, could not comprehend why the Mannan family, who used to live in this house, had travelled to Syria for a new life. If lifelong friends cannot spot the signs that 12 members of the same family were prepared to leave, it shows what difficulties the authorities face as well. The families of two east London school girls who fled to Syria to join the militants have confirmed that they have been in contact to reveal their marriages to men approved by IS. Police launched an international manhunt for 15-year-old Shamima Begum, 16-year-old Kadiza Sultana and 15-year-old Amira Abase in February after they left Britain to become so-called jihadi brides. Almost 10 million voters in Greece will vote tomorrow on whether the country should accept the terms of an international bailout deal. Alexis Tsipras, the Greek Prime Minister, is urging voters to say no, but polls suggest the result is far from certain. Our correspondent Chris Morris is in Athens. Good evening, good evening, the radical left-wing government came to power here in Athens, promising to change Greece’s relationship with the eurozone, it has come down to this referendum, which the six months after the radical left-wing government came to power here in Athens, promising to change Greece’s relationship with the eurozone, it has come down to this referendum, which the government is about ending austerity and negotiating a better deal, while opponents say it is about staying in or leaving the is about ending austerity and negotiating a better deal, while opponents say it is about staying in or leaving the euro.

It comes as the final five bodies of Britons killed in Sousse were returned home. In all, 30 British holidaymakers lost their lives. Our correspondent Nick Higham reports. For the fourth and final time, an RAF plane brought a sad cargo back from Tunisia. The five coffins were unloaded with dignity and deliberation. Military ceremonial for civilian victims of the worst terror attack on British citizens in a decade. Innocent holiday- makers gunned down on the sand. Claire Windass was a grandmother and local council worker from Hull. Her husband escaped unscathed. Bruce Wilkinson was described as a devoted husband, father and grandfather. He was from East Yorkshire and used to work at the Drax power station. Chris Dyer was an engineer from Watford. His wife, Gina, was badly injured. Stuart Cullen was from Suffolk. His wife, too, was hurt. And Lisa Burbidge was a grandmother from Newcastle, on her sixth visit to the same hotel. Meanwhile, one of three Irish victims of the shooting was buried in County Meath. Lorna Carty was a farmer’s wife and nurse. I have no words of human comfort to ease your loss. We as neighbours, as a community, and friends in shock, can only be there with you in your loss. And in London, as flowers and cards piled up outside the coroner’s court, the inquest into the deaths of another four victims was formally opened and adjourned. The Chancellor, George osborne, is expected to use Wednesday’s Budget to announce that people living in social housing and earning more than £30,000 will have to pay higher rents from 2017. In London, those earning over 40,000 will be affected. It is estimated households will have to find an extra £3,500 a year to cover the increased rent. Our political correspondent Alex Forsyth is here. Alex how many people could this affect? Europe’s element, the single 340,000 households this could affect around 340,000 households across Englandso that means council properties or housing association properties, who earn more than the it means that people living in social housing, so that means council properties or housing association properties, who earn more than the could have to pay UP earn more than the could have to pay up to the market value for their rent. On average the discount at the moment is about £3500 per so someone earning £30,000 property might have to pay £70 more per in a social housing property might have to pay £70 more those. The idea is to preserve social housing for those on the very lowest incomes it is what the government calls ending the taxpayer funded subsidies for it is what the government calls ending the taxpayer funded subsidies for tenants who are high earners. Who are high earners. It those tenants do not see it the same way. It is all part £12 billion of And changes to inheritance tax? That’s right. We expect that it will be announced. And changes to inheritance tax? That’s right. We expect that it will be announced that the point people start paying inheritance tax will go up. So, a married couple could have a property worth leave it to their children, and not have to pay inheritance tax. They are which they have been keen on for a long time, but you can expect some serious Conservative ideas which they have been keen on for a long time, but you can expect some from people who believe they have got the wrong opposition from those who believe they have got the wrong priorities. Eurotunnel says it is expecting further disruption tonight, after more than 100 migrants tried to storm the terminal in Calais last night. The company is calling on the French and British governments to take more action to protect passenger and freight services. Damian Grammaticas reports from Calais. It is the desperation of those searching for a better life. The risks they are prepared to take. Filmed by a passenger waiting to use the Channel Tunnel last night, two men climb onto the rail tracks - their aim, to smuggle themselves to England. When they think the coast is clear, they try to make it to the waiting shuttle. Every day now, 800 migrants are being found trying to cross like this, undeterred by the fact that £160 million has been spent on Eurotunnel security, on guards, scanners and fences. This time the men were spotted and made their escape. Every night, the migrants try their luck again. In Kent, after the delays caused by the migrants last night, more back-ups today. Hours of waiting to get into the tunnel. A technical fault was blamed, but the disruptions are growing. The chair of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, in Calais to see the problems for himself, said only preventing people from reaching Europe will help things. We need to make sure that people are returned to their country of origin, or they are processed before they get to the EU. You mean processing centres in Libya, in north Africa? At the moment the Italians are very keen on it. I think this is probably the best course of action. You can then separate the genuine asylum seekers from those who have paid in some cases up to $10,000 to get theirjourney to the UK. After all the problems here in the last few weeks, Keith Vaz warned that unless more help is given to the French, we should prepare for a summer of crisis. But what will concern many is that there is no let-up in the migrant flows crossing the Mediterranean. And that will mean more pressure here at Calais. With all the sport, here’s olly Foster at the BBC Sport Centre. Andy Murray had a bit of a scare in his third round match at Wimbledon today but he is through to the 4th round. Yet again he will be the only British player in the second week, although james Ward came very close tojoining him. The women’s champion, Petra Kvitova, was also beaten. Our sports correspondent Andy Swiss was at Wimbledon today. Priorities. Composed, and in the form of his life. What could possibly go wrong? Nothing composed, and in the form of his life. What could possibly go wrong? Nothing, it seemed, as Andy Murray again against Andreas Seppi imperious style. In a flash, he was imperious style. In a flash, he was two sets up. When Seppi called for to be that. But Murray suddenly struggled, clutching his shoulder, break, that seemed to be that. But Murray suddenly struggled, clutching his shoulder in pain, he lost the next six games. What on earth was going wrongwhen Seppi broke at the start of the fourth set, Centre Court feared the worst. But it wasMurray’s turned to receive treatment. But whatever it revived him in spectacular fashion. From the depths, he roared back, winning the next six games, and the strangest of matches. And out here on the hill, you can sense the relief. Some worrying moments for the Andy Murray fan club, but he is through to the next round. Afterwards he insisted his shoulder was fine. The trainer came out and manipulated my back, gave it a few good cracks. It looked extremely painful. A and 90 kilograms guy lying on top of you is not that pleasant, but it helps. james Ward led two sets to one, but his hopes were dashed, losing the deciding set 8-6. But there was no doubting the shock of the day, as Petra Kvitova’s title defence came to a shuddering halt against jelena jankovic. It seemed that she could scarcely believe it. There was a very familiar story at Silverstone today. Lewis Hamilton secured his eighth pole position of the season in nine races, as Mercedes secured a 1-2 on the grid for the seventh FBCE. Hamilton was a tenth of a second quicker than Nico Rosberg ahead of tomorrow’s British Grand Prix. He leads his teamate by 10 points in the drivers standings. England’s women are playing Germany in the third-place play-off in Canada. England have never beaten Germany in 20 attempts. With about 15 minutes left in normal time, it is currently goalless, and England have got Karen Bardsley to thank for that. The USA face japan in the final tomorrow. Great Britain’s Chris Froome says he would have liked a better start to this year’s Tour De France. The race got under way in the Netherlands today with an eight-mile time-trial around the streets of Utrecht. Froome, who won the tour two years ago, lies in 39th place overall, but there are another 20 stages and over 2,000 miles to go before the riders hit the Champs Elysees. Australia’s Rohan Dennis is the first man to claim the Yellow jersey. He averaged over 34 miles an hour, which is a Tour record, and he’ll start tomorrow’s second stage with a five second lead. just four days before the start of the Ashes, Australia have lost one of their key bowlers. Ryan Harris took 57 wickets against England in the last 3 series, but the 35 year old has been forced to retire from cricket after a recurrence of an knee injury. The First Test starts on Wednesday in Cardiff. Pat Cummins will replace him in their squad. You can see more on all of today’s stories on the BBC News Channel. That’s all from me. Good night. After last night’s thunder and like mean, tonight will be much calmer. And it will be cooler as well. It will be a sunny start to Sunday for most, but there will be some heavy showers around tomorrow. There will be some overnight in Scotland and Northern Ireland as well. Still quite misty in Shetland. At her most, it is a dry night with clear skies, and we also will have lost the humidity. It should be a comfortable night. Increasingly tomorrow morning, the cloud thickening across the south-east corner. Some uncertainty about how much rain we will see here. Elsewhere, generally a sunny start. Some quite intense downpours are likely late in the day. As always, some places will avoid the showers. Most places will see some sunshine, lifting the temperatures to roundabout the average for the time of year, which means it will be cooler than it has been for much of this week. And that cooler theme will continue for much of next week as well. I still carry that little caterpillar. But then nobody wanted to eat the sushi. As we’ll be discussing, cosmologists are studying...

138,BBC News 24,2-jul-2015,BBC News at Six,18:00,30 mins,True,"The government sets out the case for airstrikes against so-called Islamic State targets in Syria. The RAF is already bombing in Iraq. The Defence Secretary says in the light of IS attacks such as in Tunisia, Syria should be targeted too. Every cowardly attack will only harden our resolve. We are in this for the long term. Meanwhile, the coffins of nine more British tourists come back from Tunisia, flown into RAF Brize Norton. All the British dead have now been positively identified. The official UK death toll is confirmed as 30. Also tonight: The BBC learns of proposals considered by the government for major cuts to housing and sickness benefits. A crying shame - heartbreak as an own goal costs England’s lionesses their chance of a World Cup final. And lightning strikes not once, but 19,000 times - on a night of summer storms. On BBC London: Relatives of a Luton family who failed to return from holiday say they’ve received confirmation they’re in Syria.. And, attacked at Blackfriars Crown Court, a security guard is in a critical condition. doesn’t have enough drivers. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. The Defence Secretary - Michael Fallon - has been telling MPs why they should consider the launch of airstrikes against so-called Islamic State in Syria. Currently RAF bombers are limiting their attacks to IS targets in Iraq - but Mr Fallon suggested the mission might be extended as the group is known to be organised and directed from northern Syria. He said recent events in Tunisia had underlined the threat from international terrorism - but that the RAF mission would not be extended without a majority vote in the Commons. Our deputy political editor james Landale reports. For nine months, British warplanes have launched air strikes like these against forces known as Islamic State across Iraq. But they have not done so in Syria. Yet the murder of 30 Britons buy this gunman into his ear, for which IS has claimed responsibility, has prompted ministers to ask should British forcesjoin coalition ministers to ask should British forces join coalition strikes forcesjoin coalition strikes in Syria where so many operations are planned. There must be a full spectrum response to deal with Isil in Syria, Iraq and Libya. The Prime Minister has made it clear that we shall not return to the House for parliamentary authority to conduct air strikes in Syria, unless there is a sufficient consensus behind it. Since the autumn, eight Tornadojets based in Cyprus and unmanned aircraft have flown more than 1000 missions and conducted 300 successful strikes. But as they have flown over Syria, they have only been able to carry out surveillance. Two Magri years ago, MPs voted against David Cameron’s plans for a air strikes against the Assad regime in Syria, above all, because Labour was opposed. Today, the party said it was ready to consider air strikes in Syria if some conditions were met. We all need to be clear about what difference any action would make to our objective of defeating Isil, our nature of actions, its objectives and legal basis. But Labour’s position in the Commons will not become clear until it elects a new leader in September. Many MPs remain sceptical about extending military action without a clear strategy or more planes. What is it he can identify about the participation of UK forces that will make any vital difference in this situation whatsoever? Wouldn’t it be a terrible mistake for us to react to this provocation by having mission creep? The problem we face is that there are no good outcomes to be had whatever course of action we take. As it is, British forces make up only a small part of the coalition effort against IS. Notes air strikes are carried out by American aircraft. Some question what difference any British attacks would make. Certainly the attacks have inconvenienced them and they have lost some areas but it has only really complicated IS’s lives. It has not stopped them moving around. David Cameron has long wanted to attack red targets in Syria. He believes it is worth exploring the option again. That does not mean NES strikes are inevitable or imminent, itjust means he wants to strikes are inevitable or imminent, it just means he wants to test the parliamentary mood. If you cannot get the numbers, he will not act. For now, these planes will continue to strike Iraq alone, while the government ponders what more it can do to protect British citizens abroad. The last of the 30 British victims of the attack in Tunisia have been named by the Foreign Office as nine more of the bodies were flown back to the UK today. Meanwhile, officials in Tunisia say they have arrested 12 people but police are still searching for two men suspected of having trained in Libya with the gunman. Duncan Kennedy reports from RAF Brize Norton. This was not the homeward journey anyone wanted. A fleet of vehicles in Tunis this morning, carrying the bodies of nine more British victims to the airport. Three hours later, framed by the clouds above the Oxfordshire countryside, the transport plane bearing their coffins arrived at RAF Brize Norton. One of four repatriation flights, so great is the scale of this tragedy. With the aircraft door lowered, the nine coffins emerged, borne with dignity and respect by military personnel on behalf of civilian families. Many waiting nearby to greet their loved ones in tranquillity and peace. The first two were Lisa and William Graham from Perthshire. They had been in Tunisia celebrating Lisa’s 50th birthday. Victims, said one, of a wicked crime. One by one, the caskets were brought out, each with fresh, white, flowers. Philip Heathcote from Suffolk had been celebrating his 30th wedding anniversary with his wife Alison. She was shot five times and is in hospital. Trudyjones has four children. They described her as a beautiful mother, who always put others first. For more than an hour, each coffin was taken to a chapel of rest and for private family gatherings. Ann and james McOuire had recently retired. Their church in North Lanarkshire said they had made a huge contribution. janet and john Stocker had five children and ten grandchildren. They doted on them and loved travelling. And David Thompson, the oldest British victim of all, an 80-year-old former nuclear scientist who adored walking. All the names came as the Foreign Secretary confirmed the final figure of British dead in last week’s beach massacre. We now have all 30 British victims positively identified, and we can say with a high degree of confidence, that is now the final death toll of British nationals killed in this incident. Tomorrow at noon, there will be a minute’s silence across Britain to remember all those who died. The 30 British people whose summer holidays went from joy to grief. With me now is or security correspondent Frank Gardner. Let’s come back to this talk in the House of Commons today about bombing so-called Islamic State targets. There were different views about whether or not it would be a good idea. What is your assessment about how much in fact it would have if it was to go ahead? Very little. This is largely cosmetic. That is not to say the air strikes have not had an impact. They have on penning in so-called Islamic State. If you imagine an apple pie, you are baking it. You have made the pastry and you are crimping around the edges. You are trying to stop it spreading down onto the table. That is what you’re doing. It is a slightly stretched analogy. You are not going to destroy the entity, it. It spreading any further. That is what the air strikes are doing. They have stopped it taking over the Mosul Dam, per Barney and other places. This will not make a major difference. This will risk pilots’ not make a major difference. This will risk pilots’ lives if they do it. Nobody wants to see RAF pilots getting burned alive like the poor jordanian. There is a serious risk to pilots. I am not convinced the strategic games are worth it but, hey, I’mjust strategic games are worth it but, hey, I’m just a journalist. Thank you. Major cuts to housing and sickness benefits have been considered by the government, the BBC has learned. They’ve also been looking at lowering further the total amount of benefits that can be claimed by a household in parts of the UK. It’s part of Conservative plans to save £12 billion from the welfare budget, announced during the election campaign. Michael Buchanan has more details. Samantha has not worked since her daughter was born. She is currently looking for a job. In the meantime, all the wreck on this flat is played by Howden -- all the wreck on this flat is played by Howden -- all the rent on this flat is paid by housing benefit. That could change. This single mum says any cut will push her into debt and lead to addiction. If I was to be evicted because I had not paid the rent, there is always the scare that they will say you have made yourself intentionally homeless because you have not paid the money so I am very scared. Today’s spiralling housing costs have their root in the 1970s. Last year, he bought his house under the GLC. This man was a trailblazer, one of the first to buy his council house in 1978. As many followed suit, social housing became more scarce. Since this house was sold off, the number of people claiming housing benefit and stayed roughly the same. But costs have skyrocketed. More and more people have been forced to rent in private accommodation which is much more expensive. Nora’s concerns ITIUCi’I ITIOFE âXpâI’ISiVâ. NOFBIS COFICEITIS BFE much more expensive. Nora’s concerns are about possible changes to sickness benefit. Herath writers causes mobility problems so she gets support allowance.

She says the extra money is necessary due to the cost of being ill. The reliance on mY cost of being ill. The reliance on my car which is huge, the amount of petrol I get through because I have to use my car. It is not a choice. I used to love walking but I have to have my car now. For me, it is entirelyjustified that have my car now. For me, it is entirely justified that we get that additional money. This form of government adviser says however that ESA needs to change. It is incentivising things like staying on benefits. People are ending up being parked or trapped on benefit. Some of the details of the welfare cuts will be announced next week. A Treasury spokesperson said they do not comment on budget speculation. The BBC is to cut up to 1,000 jobs after revealing a £150 million shortfall in its finances - because of fewer people paying the licence fee as more people watch programmes online. The Director General Tony Hall said he wanted to see a ""simpler, leaner BBC"" with most of the job losses coming from management posts. The BBC understands that a family of 12 from Luton, who went missing on a trip to Bangladesh in May, have contacted UK relatives to say they are in Syria. Police in Bedfordshire say one of the group was stopped at Heathrow Airport the day before they left, and their home in Luton searched, because of concerns they were trying to travel to Syria. BP has reached a £12 billion settlement with the US Department ofjustice for the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. It’s the largest environmental fine in American history. Over 125 million gallons of oil poured into the Gulf after an explosion at the Deepwater Horizon oil rig. Shares in the company rose on news of the deal. It was the most heartbreaking end to the England Women’s World Cup football campaign - an own goal in the dying seconds of the match against japan meant their chance of reaching the final died too. There’s been widespread praise though for the team known as the Lionesses - after reaching a World Cup semi-final for the first time. Katie Gornalljoins us from Edmonton in Canada now, it was a desperate moment for Laura Bassett who was clearly devastated. She was, yes. She will know all too well that if everything had gone to plan for England the team would be checking out of their hotel and flying to Vancouver for a final. Instead, they are staying for a third-place play-off match against Germany. Laura Bassett has been a big presence on and off the pitch. Her team are adamant that this own goal should not define her. England are out of the women’s World Cup. Their World Cup dream crushed in the cruellest fashion. There has been heartache in an England shirt before, but Laura Bassett and her team may have just experienced the most brutal yet. It could have been so different. England tookjust 30 seconds to ruffle the world champions. They looked organised. That changed when Claire Rafferty was caught out. A japanese player was brought down. Was it inside or outside? The referee made up her mind. Panic is not the England way. Soon, they had some good fortune of their own. Ao minutes in, and already it felt like this match had gone to penalties. Now England were the better team. Extra time seemed inevitable. But there finish was thrown off course. Bassett lunched and sent japan into the final with almost the last kick of the game. Her pain prompted hundreds to post in support on social media. For her family back home there has been a lot to take in. I dash -- home there has been a lot to take in. I dash -- I have understood there has been some positive responses. She is a mid-to young woman and she will take it in her stride. England’s campaign lasted longer than expected. Their success has been put down to togetherness. Laura Bassett many that now more than ever. The risks are pleased to consider bombing Islamic State targets in Syria. Later on BBC London: Passengers flying into Stansted endure long delays at passport control. UK Border Force promise to make the service faster. And, 10 years on, we hear from the commuter who brought comfort to the victims of the London bombings. of last night’s lightning storms across the country. All this week we’re looking at how close the world has come to achieving the millennium development goals - set out by the UN at the turn of the century to improve the lives of those in developing countries. One of them was to combat HIV/AIDS and other diseases. HIV is the world’s largest epidemic with around 35 million people living with the disease. And the country with the greatest proportion of those is South Africa with more than 6 million. That number is still growing but critically the rate of new infections has more than halved. And more than 3 million people are being given life-saving drugs. But there are now new health threats on the horizon. In a township outside Durban, health workers are doing their rounds. Modern comforts are thin on the ground here, but disease isn’t. At least one in six are living with HIV. They offer advice and, more importantly, anti-retroviral drugs. To people like Monica, they’re life-savers. TRANSLATION: I think I’m very lucky. If I didn’t have access to the drugs, I would be dead by now. I have hope that I will recover. Young women should not be afraid to get tested. Being HIV-positive is not a death sentence. For many years, the South African government was in denial about the extent of the problem, claiming that home remedies such as beetroot and garlic were sufficient. But now that has all changed, because millions now have access to the right treatment, which is saving lives. But if prevention is better than cure, then it’s the young who need to be educated. Young people such as these girls. In full song, they arrive at a centre helping to combat HIV. New infections may be falling thanks to education, but the highest new infection rates are still amongst young girls. That is partly due to so-called ""sugar daddies,"" where older men shower young girls with cash and gifts. In return, they expect sex. They have money, so why would I say no to a person who has money? They are able to provide first, and you become cool, recognised as a cool girl who has an expensive phone, wearing cool clothes. I think when a sugar daddy gives money, he is up to something. And when he wants something you have to give it him, because you are taking his money. Running the centre is Mandisa. If anyone knows the cost of South Africa’s HIV epidemic, it is her. When she wasjust 13, her mother was beaten to death by locals for coming out in public as HIV-positive. Since then, she has made it her mission to remove the shame associated with the disease. For us to address the problem, we need to face the stigma and find ways of addressing it. And the first step is to give women and girls a platform to disclose their status, and also to talk about HIV. But while progress is made on tackling HIV, the growing threat is TB. It thrives amongst people living with HIV, and there is increasing concern over new drug-resistant strains. We now have this emerging epidemic. It is particularly severe here in KwaZulu-Natal, where we have XDR TB. These are patients with extensively drug resistant tuberculosis. This is TB that is really difficult to treat, and the mortality rate from XDR TB is incredibly high. Improvements made in the fight against HIV have resulted in life expectancy increasing by almost a decade here. But South Africans can still expect to die, on average, 20 years earlier than most Europeans. And it will take a sustained effort on both HIV and TB if that is to change. For the first time the government has set out how it intends to make its pledge of English Votes for English Laws a reality. Let’s talk to our political correspondent Alex Forsyth - so how are they actually going to do this? This might sound like quite a dry debate about Parliamentary procedure but actually it is about who gets the final say on crucial legislation to do with things like health and education. The government’s plan is that decisions which only affect England, things to do with road or hospitals, should need the support of a majority of English MPs as well as the whole House of Commons. Welsh MPs would also get a final say on things affecting England and Wales. The government’s argument is that as more powers handed to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, it is only fair that English MPs get more control over English issues but the SNP says that this risks creating a 2 tier situation in Parliament with Scottish MPs feeling second class, furthering the case for independence. Labour says it has been rushed through and conservatives say it does not go far enough. The government can expect fierce opposition when it comes to a vote. Thank you. Tributes have been paid to the entertainer Val Doonican, who’s died at the age of 88. # For time it is a precious thing. 'The Val Doonican Show’ was a regular feature of the Saturday night schedules on TV in the 1970s and 80s with audiences of up to nineteen million people. He became famous for his mellow crooning - and also his collection of colourful jumpers. He died peacefully at a nursing home in Buckinghamshire. In today’s action at Wimbledon, Andy Murray has sailed through to the third round. Britain’s number one took less than an hour and a half to see off the Dutchman Robin Haase. Andy Swiss is there. Yesterday, there were parasols, today, brollies. After the heat wave, a familiar scene at Wimbledon but it did not deter fans including this one, Her Royal Highness, meet Rufus the hock. Hisjob is to scare off pigeons. But noise like this probably helps. By the time Andy Murray emerged, the sun was out and pretty soon so was his opponent. Robin Haase has caused him problems in the past but not today. Watched by his new wife, Andy Murray won nine of the first ten games and breezed into a 2 set lead. That is just superb! In less than an hour and a half, it was all over. An utterly dominant display from Murray but he will know that far tougher tests await him. If his progress was predictable, this was an unexpected bonus. Britain’sjames Ward, the world number 111, againstjiri world number 111, against jiri Vesely, world number 111, againstjiri Vesely, on paper he was the underdog, but on a raucous Court number two, underdog, but on a raucous Court numbertwo, he conjured underdog, but on a raucous Court number two, he conjured the match of his life. With his family willing him on, it took four sets but it was worth it. It is great. I cannot put it into words. It is something I have wanted to do for a long time. It doesn’t stop here, hopefully I It doesn’t stop here, hopefully! can carry on. At 28, james Ward has waited a long time for this. Rarely has fatherly pride been quite so plain to see. Already, two wins today for British players but hopes of a third are fading. Aljaz Bedene, born in Slovenia and representing Slovenia, he is in action against Viktor Troicki but he is currently trailing by two sets. Elsewhere, no major shocks. Wins for Roger Federer and Petra Kvitova, but Rafa Nadal is in a struggle, losing the first set to Dustin Brown. After the hottest july day on record, much of northern England was hit overnight by thunderstorms, hailand rain. In places thousands of homes were left without power. The met office estimates there were more than 19,000 lightning strikes across Britain by this morning. Danny Savage’s report contains some flashing images. Spectacular electrical storms lit up the sky across a large part of the UK last night. 19,000 lightning strikes were recorded yesterday, and not all of them were harmless. This family home in Ferryhill in County Durham was virtually destroyed by one strike. Luckily, everyone was out and the owner was today assessing the damage with firefighters. We are just absolutely devastated. We have lost our home. It is pretty much completely destroyed. We will rebuild it and make it a home once again because we’re not going to move. The kids are upset but they are fine. They are looking forward to getting back home as soon as possible. Further north in Newcastle, another home was hit by a bolt from the sky. It sparked a fire, which ripped through the loft and bedrooms. It was not just thunder and lightning. Hail storms battered many places. This was the scene in North Yorkshire yesterday evening. And in Halifax, there were pictures taken of cliches the size of hailstones. And we’re not done with the storms yet. More are expected across the UK over the next 24 hours. As you heard, the storms are still going on and Nick Miller is here to tell us more. I want to show you the radar picture over the past few hours. Take a look at what has been happening. Some intense downpours developing in parts of north and East Yorkshire. Some thunderstorms, bright colours on the rainfall picture. Torrential rain possible, hail is possible. But last night, this was all part of a wider area of wet weather. Stretching into Scotland. As the night goes on, it will clear zero words, leaving us dry by the end of the night. Patchy mist and fog, and look at these temperatures. Coming down overnight. Much cooler and fresh out and about first thing in the morning. Tomorrow is looking like a gorgeous day. Lots of sunshine to come. And after that fresh feel first thing, it will turn warm again in that sunshine in the afternoon. Hot and humid in the south-east, near30 afternoon. Hot and humid in the south-east, near 30 once again. As the heat and humidity comes back, here we go again. Tomorrow evening and tomorrow night, more storms sweeping up from the south of the UK. These are looking quite nasty. Again, torrential. Frequent lightning, gusty wind, and difficult driving conditions. That could be some disruption so Friday night is looking stormy. That takes us to the start of the weekend and what is left of that weather system, for Northern Britain, giving wet weather in places. Gradually drying up in the south. Still some heat around. But by Sunday, we are all cooler and fresher. It is a standard British date, with sunshine and showers and temperatures about 20 degrees. What a summer. That’s all from the BBC News at Six, so it’s goodbye from me and on On the programme tonight: ",,
139,BBC1 London,2-jul-2015,BBC London News,18:30,30 mins,True,"On the programme tonight: Relatives of a family from Luton who failed to return from holiday receive confirmation they’re now in Syria. It seems to me that they are being peddled allergist propaganda telling them there is some sort of Utopia, a life much better than they have got here. It has emerged one of them had peevishly been stopped at Heathrow. I will have the latest on a female prison officer in critical condition at hospital after being attacked by a male prisoner at Blackfriars Crown Court. Plus, the Londoner hoping to solve Greece’s financial woes, with a little help from the online community. And, keeping the skill of glass-blowing alive. Why one artist is opening his studio doors to the public. We sta rt We start with news of an inquiring into the death ofjohn Palmer. The police watchdog has been asked to investigate what’s being described as a botched murder investigation into the death of one of Britain’s most notorious criminals. Essex Police have been criticised for their handling of the investigation into the deathjohn Goldfinger Palmer whose body was discovered at his home in Brentwood eight days ago. At the time, officers said they weren’t treating his death as suspicious. But a post-mortem examination revealed that he’d died from a gunshot wound to the chest. Yvonne Hall reports. In the middle of peaceful Essex Woodlands, the scene of a brutal murder. john Palmer, he was found dead at his home address in sand pit lane, the result of gunshot injuries. One of the most notorious criminals, known asjohn One of the most notorious criminals, known as john Goldfinger Palmer after being accused but cleared of handling goals in the Brinks Mat robbery at Heathrow in 1983. Here, interviewed in Spain, denying guilt. I am completely innocent of any, anything to do with this so-called bullion raid. In 2001, he was convicted, this time for swindling millions from pensioners in a time-share fraud in Tenerife. He was released four years later. In 2007, he was accused of masterminding a multi-million pound crime gang in Tenerife and has been on bail since. Last Wednesday, his body was found near his home in Brentwood. Police initially said there were no suspicious circumstances. Two days ago, they said it was murder. People will find it hard to understand gunshot wounds were not noticed straightaway. It is a reasonable question, that the family and public are entitled to ask. I want to find the people responsible. john O’Connor says the investigation was botched. It is up to the police to get the resources in so you can get off on the right foot, and treat it as a murder and have a proper murder scene and deal with that. They are six days late, they have lost the murder scene. john Palmer’s house is in a secluded location at the end of this dirt track which turns off two miles from Brentwood. An area popular with dog walkers and horse riders. Police are urging anyone in this area between 4:30pm and 6pm last Wednesday to contact them urgently. Forensic teams are scouring the luxury home and extensive grounds for clues. Meanwhile, the IPCC will investigate exactly why murder was not immediately suspected when the body was found in a week ago. A female prison officer remains in a critical condition in hospital, after she was assaulted at Blackfriars Crown Court. She was attacked as she escorted a prisoner. Helen Drew is outside the court this evening with more details. This woman works for Serco as a custody officer, and in her 50s. She was transferring a prisoner from the court room to a van parked outside. The male prisoner attacked her. It is thought there was another member of staff with her but details are not known. The London air applets was called and treated her at the scene before airlifting her to hospital in East London where she has been in a critical condition since. She is on a life-support machine and it is thought she is very serious. A man called Humphrey Buck, 22, has been arrested, charged with GBH. What are Serco saying? It is thought this woman has worked for Serco for a number of years. They tell us their thoughts are with her family. They tell us their thoughts are with herfamily. They her family. They say they’d take a 0 tolerance approach to violence against staff, and they always pressed for the most serious charge to be laid against those responsible. They say a review into safety is inevitable. I have been speaking to the Ministry ofjustice today who say they have also launched their own investigation. The union that looks after these workers, they say there must never been an opportunity for this kind of incident to be repeated. A report, exclusively revealed to BBC London, is calling for police officers to record every occasion when they stop someone in the street on video. Baroness Lawrence and London mayoral hopeful Tessa jowell are behind the report. They say the measure would improve trust among black communities. The Met plans to roll out 20,000 body cams by next spring, and says officers should switch them on for stop and search practices. Passengers flying into Stansted have expressed anger after encountering lengthy delays at passport control. The airport’s operator has told the BBC they’ve complained directly to the Immigration Minister. Tonight, Border Force admitted that the service they’re offering at peak times is ""less than desirable"". Richard Daniel reports. 7:30am today, passengers arriving at Stansted queue for passport control. And this was the scene on Monday. Hundreds of people. It took an hour to get through. In May, Mrs Moss was also delayed, queueing for an hour after returning from Cyprus. There was no one there. Only the people in the booths checking passports, they were the only staff and they could not talk to us. Like people could outside but there was no one there. Were there enough booths running? There were loads of booths but there were no people in them. Stansted is investing £80 million on the tunnel. All to improve the travelling experience. Critics say the long delays show it is struggling to cope with an increasing number of passengers. Parking, queues, taxis, baggage handling, border control. Stansted isn’t really geared up to do a great deal more in terms of passengers travelling. The terminal seems already under pressure. The airport said at times passengers are becoming frustrated by delays. It is pushing the Home Office for improvements at passport control. We are keen we get equality in the service from Border Force to that of other airports in London and the UK. We have made representations to the Minister. We want him to recognise the challenges we face at Stansted and the frustrations of our customers. The average BVEFBQE QUEUE eight minutes. We acknowledge that, at times, when large amounts of flights are landing, the queueing experience is less than desirable. Heightened security following the Tunisian shootings is only likely to make matters worse. Police in Luton are still trying to establish what’s happened to a family who failed to return from a visit to Bangladesh. It’s thought the 12, which includes a baby and two grandparents, may have travelled to Syria. Today it emerged that police stopped a family member at Heathrow almost three months ago, forcing them to miss their flight. She stands smiling next to her brothers, 21-year-old Mergea is thought to be the driver forced the time the family’s disappearance. Voters believe she joined articles who were once members of the now banned album by huge room, and engineered the flight from Heathrow that would lead to them vanishing. The day before they left on their family holiday to Bangladesh, it has emerged police stopped Miss Khanom from flying as they were suspicious she was not carrying her own luggage. On the same day, police raided the family home and took away papers. The next day, Miss Khanom was free to side with her family, there was insufficient evidence to stop her. I think the police were doing their best in difficult circumstances. There is a lot of work that goes on thatis There is a lot of work that goes on that is unseen. And, of course, they’re only had to be one incident like this for it to be seen as a success for Islamic State and put them to be seen as recruiting people to their cause. It does not mean there are vast numbers of people, most of my Muslim friends are as appalled by Islamic State and the fact anyone would think it is a nice place to live or a cause they want to support. Muslim friends are as shocked as anyone else. Police sons left behind in Newton believed their sister tricked their parents and other relatives in the family into going to Syria. It is really worrying when women are being radicalised because I thought they would be the protectors of their children and the family. They would never want their children to be lost tojihad far They would never want their children to be lost to jihad far away from this country. Now that they are involved, it is very worrying to me. The grandparents are in poor health and the children in the group are aged between one and 11. Locals say they still cannot understand how three generations of one family could now be in Syria. It is really shocking this has come out. If it is true, then we don’t know what to say. We are trying our best to work with other communities and tackle all this extremism in our town. So many people in this community knew nothing about the family’s disappearance. Their fear now is other families could now simply vanish. As the tenth anniversary of the 7/7 bombings approaches, we’ve been hearing the personal stories of some of those who were there and helped victims. Tonight, Tim Coulson shares his experience of that day. He was on the Tube when a suicide bomber blew up a passing train. He wasn’t injured in the explosion, but went to the aid of those who were. Now, every year at the memorial service, he reads out the names of all those who lost their lives. This is his story, in his own words. The volume of what happened that day is always going to be difficult to talk about. But I think, also, very necessary. I would not have known how long it would take to put me back together. Finding this five years ago, an opportunity to volunteer on the River Thames, a place I knew well, where I could give something back to society. The life change started when we entered the tunnel. There was an enormous explosion in volume terms, very painful in the ears for a lot of people. Many people temporarily lost their hearing. Thinking back to what I did immediately, it was the most obvious thing, to check physically. I couldn’t see. It was pitch black at that time. I could tell that I had arms and legs, and I became aware immediately of the sounds of people screaming, possibly in pain. Not anything we could see at that point. The three of us were unknown to one another, and moved to the rear of our train to see if we could get out and try to help those people. Diagonally to my right was a completely charred corpse. I had never seen one before. The severity of that drove me to look away from that corpse to a person opposite me, who had no clothes on the top of their body, and was half in and half out of what would have been the floor of the carriage. He seemed very weak, for the damage that had been caused to him. I had not initially seen that. Very swiftly, the man I now know to be Stan, died in my arms. His eyes were still open, and I deliberately closed them because I felt that he had finished with this world, and he should not be looking at this world any more. It was as a mark of respect and also, because my background as a Christian, I said a prayerfor him. And I felt I had failed somewhat. Why had I not kept this chap live? I went under the train to find out what had happened to him and found out that, in fact, his body had been severed in half. There was no chance for Stan. And no great suffering for him. The anxiety in my terms was colossal. But I was fortunate and, it might sound strange, but the fortunate aspect for me was that I heard a female voice behind my left shoulder screaming, and that initially said, you have no time to think about yourself, there is somebody else that needs help. I told her who I was, and she explained who she was. And we held hands. And she said, please don’t leave I still find that moment somewhat challenging. Because, although I told her that I would not, and I did not, I actually hoped that I could stay, to make her life more comfortable. Her injuries were such that she did not die, and she was very uncomfortable. We spent a long time underground, an hour and a half before the emergency services appeared to help. I would like to say that if it happened I would do it again but I do not know that I would. just as I did not know that I was going to do that on that day. And arguably, yes, I would have been a different person. But I still feel that, in general terms, Ido not think I would or could have done anything different. That is who I am. Tim Coulson, reflecting on the day of the London bombings 10 years ago. Still to come tonight: The art of glass-blowing is alive and well in London and I will be talking to one of the masters of the craft. As uncertainty continues to loom over Greece’s future, one Londoner decided to take action to try and help, by setting up an online site where the public can make donations to help the country. His vision is to raise 1.6 billion euros by Sunday, ahead of the Greek referendum. So far, almost £1.5 million has been pledged. Alice Bhandhukravi has more. He is thousands of miles from Athens, and more than1 billion EUFOS off his target of rescuing the Greek economy, but that hasn’t stopped Tom Feeney helping the people of Greece by urging the rest of us in Europe to donate a few pounds. He assures me he has no links to the Greek Government and his aim is purely philanthropic. Are you Greek? I am not Greek. Are you a relative of Alexis Tsipras? I have no connection with him. Why then this cause? It is not necessarily about the Greek people. I think it is about working-class ordinary people in Europe, whether people be in Scotland, northern England, Wales. There are a lot of people across Europe affected by austerity. It is certainly a long shot and, even if he could raise the money, it is not clear what could be done with it. It is not for me to decide what the Greek people want to do with that money. Personally, I think the IMF should cancel the Greek debt. But, if it came to it, then the Greek people could decide to use that money to pay the debt. A few miles down the road in the City of London, people at this Greek restaurant seemed to approve the gesture. Maybe I should do more being a Greek myself, maybe we Greeks should take action and support our mother country. It is something worthwhile, that a foreign person is trying to help us. It is a nice gesture. It is unlikely this crowd funding will make its way to the Greeks queueing up outside banks and protesting in the streets. If the target of 1.6 billion euros is missed, donations will be refunded. While most of us are looking forward to our summer holidays, for one football club, they’re already over. West Ham are back on the pitch tonight, to kick off what will be a big season for the Hammers, as it’s their last at Upton Park before they move to the Olympic Stadium. As Emma jones reports. West Ham are back in Europe for the first time in nine years, and that means a very early start to their season. Tonight, they play host to Andorran side FC Lucitans in the first of six Europa League matches before the Premier League kicks off. Whether it is the cut-price tickets or that this is the first match of a final season at Upton Park, the game is a sell out. It will be exciting, an important European game, which is probably why it has sold out. It is good to get going because I like watching football, but I guess there is more chance of injuries before the Premier League starts. The match has come too early for the new manager, Slavan Bilic, leaving the coaching duties to a man who knows more about the younger players who feature tonight. There is not a lot of football at the moment. It’s the last years at Upton Park, people have wanted to see European football. But they also want to see the combination of the senior players, Diafra Sakho playing with younger players, and people are turning up to see that I am sure. The senior side are looking forward to getting to know a slightly scary Billic soon. You can hear a pin drop at times, that is his presence. I have met him briefly. He is obviously very excited to be involved with us this year. He has stated that in the press, and everyone is looking forward to working with him. West Ham’s priority will be to take Premier League football to their new home at the Olympic Stadium. A lengthy European campaign could be an unwanted distraction. As expected, Andy Murray made it safely through to the third round of Wimbledon today. joining him there will be a Londoner for whom it’s uncharted territory. james Ward won a second round match at the tournament for the very first time. Chris Slegg is in SW19. Was he surprised or relieved? He mentioned the word, belief. Ido not know whether he was surprised but many people here were. He took on an opponent world ranking number 1+5. Ward is ranked 111. Playing in the second round for only the second time. It would always be a tall order and it took him two hours and 1+5 minutes. His opponent was hindered by a shoulder injury which he took advantage of. Ward’s family were there. When I asked him to describe the emotions of reaching the third round for the first time, this is what he had to say. Into the third round of Wimbledon, I can’t ask for anything more at the moment. I am still playing in the tournament and looking to win another match on Saturday. I didn’t this too many balls, made a lot of returns, and put the pressure on to make sure he didn’t have it easy. A little bit relieved and happy I have reached the third round for the first time. Good luck to him. Not such good news for Aljaz Bedene? for Aljaz Bedene ? We were for Aljaz Bedene? We were hoping for three British men through to the third round for the first time in 16 years. In the last quarter of an hour, he was beaten. It was going to be a tall order for was beaten. It was going to be a tall orderfor him, his first Wimbledon as a British citizen. He was born in Slovenia, he took British citizenship. I spoke to his coach who was cautiously optimistic his man could pull off a surprise to date but it hasn’t been. Two British men through. Andy Murray as expected, and London’s james Ward is there as well. Let us hope he can deliver. His work is bought by people from around the world, and his A-list clients include the likes of Sir Eltonjohn. But London artist Peter Layton is concerned about the skill of glass-blowing disappearing here. So much so, he’s opened his studio doors to the public in an attempt to entice people to take up the craft. Our arts correspondent Brenda Emmanus has been to Bermondsey to find out more. It is the longest running glass-blowing studio in Europe, celebrating its 40th anniversary next year. Peter Leighton creates great works of glass at his studio space in Bermondsey Street. Glass has been made the thousands of years, the Romans and the Syrians made incredible glass. People do not realise what an incredibly versatile material it is. Glass as an artform is developing fast. It is global, it is exploding. Sadly, the industry at the same time in many respects is dying. The costs of materials, the costs of fuel, the cost of labour. Vanishing skills. They are among some of the issues we are faced with. This is one of the longest running glass-blowing in Europe, celebrating its 40th anniversary next year. studio is twice a month, the studio called la -- studio is twice a month, the studio called la -- classes for the public. Now in his late 70s, Peter also supports a collective of last designers who work and exhibit from his south London site. I am really keen to nurture the next generation, so a number of young artists have worked their way through this studio. Some of them have gone off and started their own studios. More will do that. London glass-blowing is a smashing place to observe how the artform has evolved and where the only thing you are encouraged to break is artistic boundaries. Let’s go back to Wimbledon, this time for the weather. What a difference a day makes. Yesterday’s record-breaking heat was replaced with cloud and a few showers. We have been really lucky at FW 19. A feud showers meant a delayed start to play but it has been dry. And hot but not as bad, highs of 26 degrees. It does look this evening as if it will be a more comfortable night for sleeping. Into tomorrow, a fresh start to the day, up to 15 degrees first thing. Beautiful clear blue skies. Only one place for those temperatures to go, they will climb, highs of 30 Celsius will stop high UV, make sure you have some sunscreen. have SOITIE SUFISCFEEFI. If have some sunscreen. If you are heading to Wimbledon, you will need a sun hat and sunglasses. Temperatures are set to climb. A beautiful day. Those weather conditions will feel quite humid in the afternoon, we could see a feud cloud showers developing. In the evening, there will be more showers around. And the risk of a feud thundery showers spreading from the south. Saturday, they cleared away and Saturday looks promising again, lots of blue skies and sunshine. Again, plenty of warmth. The organisers will be happy with this forecast. Temperatures are around 28 degrees. That means pretty high pollen and some high UV. This is the outlook for the second half of the weekend, shaping up nicely with temperatures again in the mid-20s. More cloud on Monday. Plenty of dry weather. Perhaps the only people not happy will be the gardeners. It stays pretty dry. The main headlines: The Defence Secretary says Britain should consider launching airstrikes against IS targets in Syria.

The Defence Secretary urges MPs to consider airstrikes on so-called Islamic State in Syria. Michael Fallon said the RAF campaign on IS in Iraq could be extended - and the attack on Britons in Tunisia highlighted the threat they pose. Every cowardly attack will only harden our resolve. We are in this for the long-term. We’ll be examining the effectiveness of the strategy for dealing with IS. Also tonight: The Greek Finance Minister, Yanis Varoufakis, tells the BBC he’ll resign if the Greek people vote for austerity in Sunday’s referendum.

And a shock early exit from Wimbledon for two-times Rafael Nadal champion. Later on BBC London: Police face investigation after taking a week to realise this notorious criminal had been murdered. A female prison officer is in a critical condition after being assaulted outside court. Good evening. The Defence Secretary, Michael Fallon, has been laying out the case to MPs for British airstrikes against self-styled Islamic State in Syria. Currently, RAF bombers limit their attacks to IS targets in Iraq - but Mr Fallon suggested the mission might be extended, as the extremists are known to be mostly organised and directed from Northern Syria. He said recent events in Tunisia had underlined the threat from international terrorism - but that the RAF mission wouldn’t be extended without a majority vote in the Commons. Our Deputy Political Editorjames Landale reports. This is an airstrike by British warplanes in Iraq. But might they be heading for Syria too? For nine months they’ve attacked forces belonging to the group known as Islamic State in Iraq alone. But the murder of 30 Britons by this gunman in Tunisia, for which IS has claimed responsibility, has prompted prompted ministers to ask if British forces should also strike in Syria, where many IS operations are planned. There must be a full spoken response to deal with Isil at its source in places such as Syria, Iraq and Libya. The Prime Minister has made it clear that we will not return to the House for parliamentary authority to conduct airstrikes in Syria unless there is a sufficient consensus behind it. Since the autumn, eight Tornados based in Cyprus, and some unmanned aircraft, have flown more than 1,000 missions and carried out over 300 successful strikes, but over Syria British planes have conducted only surveillance and refuelling operations, keeping well clear of the devastating civil war, that for the last four years has pitched President Assad’s brutal regime, against rebel groups, including IS. The nos to the left, 285. A complex picture, that in part, led Labour and other MPs to oppose airstrikes against Assad forces in 2013. Today, Labour said it was ready to consider airstrikes in Syria, under certain conditions. We all need to be clear about what difference any action would make to our objective of defeating Isil, about the nature of any actions, its objectives and indeed its legal basis. But Labour’s firm position in the Commons will not become clear until it elects a new leader in September. And many MPs are sceptical of extending military action without a clear strategy. What exactly is it that you can identify or the Government can identify about the participation of UK forces that will make any vital difference in the situation whatsoever? The problem that we face is that there are no good outcomes to be had whatever course of action we take. As it is, British forces make up only a small part of the coalition effort against IS. Most airstrikes are carried out by American aircraft. Some question how much military difference any British attacks in Syria could make. The airstrikes have inconvenienced them. IS have lost areas that they expected to gain. But it only has really complicated their lives. It has not stopped them from moving around. David Cameron has long wanted to attack IS targets in Syria. He thinks that the Tunisian murders and other plots means that it is worth exploring the option again. That doesn’t mean that any new airstrikes are inevitable or imminent, it just means that the Prime Minister wants to test the Parliamentary mood. If he can’t get the numbers, he will not act. So for now these planes will continue to strike alone - while the Government ponders what more it can do to protect its citizens and repair its reputation as a military power. Tunisia says it uncovered and destroyed the group that killed those 38 people. Eight people with links to the attack are under arrest. Phillip Hammond has confirmed that 30 Britons were killed. Nine bodies were brought back to the UK today. We have this report. This, was not the homeward journey anyone wanted. A fleet of vehicles in Tunis this morning, carrying the bodies of nine more British victims to the airport. Three hours later, a greyjet against grey clouds, emerging over RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire. One of four repatriation flights this week - so great is the scale of this tragedy. With the aircraft door lowered, the nine coffins were brought out. Military pallbearers on behalf of civilian victims, their families waiting nearby to greet their loved ones. The first two were Lisa and William 'Billy’ Graham, from Perthshire. They had been in Tunisia, celebrating Lisa’s 50th birthday, victims, said a friend, of a wicked crime. One after another, the caskets were brought out, each with fresh, white flowers. Phillip Heathcote from Suffolk had been celebrating his 50th wedding anniversary with his wife, Allison. He died, she was shot five times. Trudyjones has four children, they described her as a beautiful mother who always put others first. For more than an hour, each coffin was moved and taken to a chapel of rest for private family reflection. Anne and james McGuire had recently retired, their church in North Lanarkshire said they had made a huge contribution. john and janet Stocker had five children and ten grandchildren, they doted on them and loved travelling. And David Thompson, the oldest British victim of all, an 80-year-old former nuclear scientist, who adored walking. As the names came through, the Foreign Secretary confirmed the final figure of British dead in last week’s attack. We now have all 30 British victims, positively identified and we can say with a high degree of confidence, that that is now the final British death toll of British nationals killed in this incident. Tonight through the soft light of an English summer’s evening, the coffins were driven to London, ahead of tomorrow’s minute of silence. A nation stopping to remember 30 people, and the grief their families are now enduring. With me now is our World Editorjohn Simpson. - the government’s paving the way for airstrikes in Syria, what’s the long-term strategy here? Well, I think one of them is to ask the question why should we stop at the Iraqi border when ISjust moves between Iraq and Syria as it chooses? But of course this is not just a British business. I mean the British play a very small part, relatively speaking. And the bombing in Iraq, which has been effective, we have only eight elderly tornado aircraft doing the bombing, it is nothing like the strength that the Americans are putting in. But in Syria a lot of NATO countries have worries about whether they should be involved, much as Britain had a couple of years ago. Only Canada, in effect, out of those NATO countries is supporting the Americans with bombing. So this is, I think, an attempt by Britain, to say, look, I know you think that we are not playing our role anymore, we are retreating from them but we are not, actually. We will play a role in this. I think that the Americans would be quite pleased. But they know it is gesture politics. Many people in the United States and in Britain, in government circles are saying, really, what Britain might do better than bombing with elderly aircraft is to start using our diplomatic skills to bring out a bigger coalition of countries in the region to do the main part of the bombing and the fighting. john, thank you very much. The Greek Finance Minister, Yanis Varoufakis, has told the BBC that he will resign if the Greek people vote ‘yes’ in the bailout referendum on Sunday. The government says the terms imposed by the EU, the European Central Bank and IMF are ""humiliating"" and the Greek people should decide. But today, the IMF said Athens needed another 50 billion euros - just to stabilise its finances. Our Europe Editor Katya Adler is in Athens. This is the first time that the IMF have said how much money it thinks that Greece needs to get its finances in order. And says that the Greek debt is unsustainable. But remember, this is an assessment, not a promise of a new deal. The IMF often disagrees with other creditors about the best way forward for this country, as the Greeks disagree ahead of a referendum on Sunday. Today, the turn of the Greek communists, a small but significant force, to take to the streets and have their say about the future of their country. They oppose the referendum on Sunday. Instead, they want Greece out of the EU and the euro. They have prepared their own ballot papers to make their point. We say no to the IMF, the European Union and to the strange bank and no to the proposals of the government. So far the to the proposals of the government. So farthe Demme So far the Demme on stations have been passionate but good human oured, this society is becoming polarised ahead of Sunday’s election, there are fears that there could be riots as there were in Athens two years ago. Emotions are running high, as there is nothing more personal, important to them, than the future of their country and of their families. The government insisted that security is under control in Greece. But what about the economy? Greece’s Finance Minister was characteristically confident when we met him. Saying he was sure that people would back his government in the referendum, voting against Greece’s previous bail out conditions, ensuring a better deal. Guaranteed. He said. How much can you promise to the Greek people? 1# 00% success. As I told you, the most interesting proposals have come to us after the banks closed and this supposed impasse between us and partners hit the headlines. Maybe things have to get worse before they get better. Yanis Varoufakis said he would resign as the Finance Minister if Sunday’s vote went against the government. But with or without him, the Greek banks would reopen. He said. Will the banks open on Monday after the referendum? Tuesday. the referendum ? Tuesday. For the referendum? Tuesday. For sure? Yes. With what cash? We need the green light that an agreement has been reached. And it will be. Fact or wishful thinking? Every day as money gets tighter, the Greeks fear that the future of their country looks bleaker. Reports from north-eastern Nigeria say around a 150 people have been killed by Boko Haram insurgents. Witnesses in the State of Borno say militants stormed three remote villages, as people gathered for evening prayers in local mosques. Major cuts to housing and sickness benefits have been considered by the government, the BBC has learned. It’s also been looking at lowering further the total amount of benefits that can be claimed by a household in parts of the UK. It’s part of Conservative plans to save £12 billion from the welfare budget- announced during the election campaign. Michael Buchanan has more details. Any more colours or does he look handsome enough? Samantha Ashby hasn’t worked since her daughter was born. She is currently looking for a job. In the meantime, all the rent on this flat in south-east London, about £1000 a month, is paid by housing benefit. But that could change. The BBC has learned the Government has been considering reducing housing benefit, making everyone contribute towards their rent. This single mum says any cut would push her into debt. And she fears eviction. If I was to be evicted because I hadn’t paid the rent, there’s always the scare they would say, you made yourself intentionally homeless by not being able to pay the money. So, obviously, I’m very scared, yeah. Today’s spiralling benefit costs have their roots in the 1970s. Last year, after 14 years as a tenant, he bought his house from the GLC under their new scheme. Terence was a trailblazer, one of the first to buy his council house, in 1978. But as many others followed suit, social housing became more scarce. Since this house was sold off, the number of people claiming housing benefit has stayed roughly the same. But costs have skyrocketed as more and more people have been forced to rent in private accommodation, which is much more expensive. We haven’t read this for ages. Have we? Laura Berridge’s concerns are about possible changes to sickness benefit. Her arthritis causes mobility problems, so she gets employment support allowance. It pays about £30 a week more thanjobseeker’s allowance, but the BBC has learned ESA may be cut for people like Laura, bringing it in line with the main unemployment benefit. She says the extra money is necessary to do the costs of being ill. The reliance on my car, which is huge, the amount of petrol I get through because I have to use my car. It’s not a choice, it’s not something I want to do, I used to love walking. But I have to have my car now. So for me it is entirelyjustified that I would get that additional money. This former government adviser says, however, ESA needs to change. It’s incentivising behaviours like staying on the benefit, trying to get onto the benefit in the first place, which are not necessarily positive. I therefore the taxpayer, expenditure, but also Either for the taxpayer, for those people ending up being parked or trapped on the benefit. We’ve also learned the Chancellor has pushed for a lower benefits cap on households outside London and south-east England. He wants them to get no more than £20,000 a year in benefits. Some of the details of the welfare cuts will be announced in next week’s budget. A Treasury spokesman said they don’t comment on budget speculation. All this week we’re looking at how close the world has come to achieving the Millennium Development Goals - set out by the UN at the turn of the century - and meant to improve the lives of people in developing countries. One of the goals was to combat HIV/Aids and other diseases. HIV is the world’s largest epidemic with around 35 million people living with the disease. And the country with the greatest proportion of those is South Africa with over six million. That number is still growing but critically - new infections have more than halved. But, as Nomsa Maseko reports from Ntuzuma, there are now new risks. In a township outside Durban, health workers are doing their rounds. Modern comforts are thin on the ground here. But disease isn’t. At least one in six are living with HIV. They offer advice and, more importantly, anti-retroviral drugs. To people like Monica, they are life-savers. TRANSLATION: I think I’m very lucky. If I didn’t have access to the right drugs, I’d be dead by now. I have hope that I’ll recover. Young women should not be afraid to get tested, being HIV-positive is not a death sentence. For many years the South African Government was in denial about the extent of the problem, claiming that home remedies such as beetroot and garlic were sufficient. But now that has all changed because millions now have access to the right treatment, which is saving lives. But if prevention is better than cure, then it’s the young who need to be educated. Young people such as these girls. In full song, they arrive at a centre helping to combat HIV. New infections may be falling, thanks to education, but the highest new infection rates are still amongst young girls. That’s partly due to so-called sugar daddies, where older men shower young girls with cash and gifts. In return, they expect sex. They have money, so why would I say no to a person who has money? Yeah, so they are able to provide us, so we become cool. Recognised as a cool girl who has expensive phones, wearing cool clothes. I think when sugar daddy gives you money, he’s up to something. And when he wants that thing, you have to give him it, because you are taking his money. Running the centre is Mandisa. If anyone knows the cost of South Africa’s HIV epidemic, it is her. When she wasjust 13, her mother was beaten to death by locals for coming out in public as HIV-positive. Since then, she has made it her mission to remove the shame associated with the disease. For us to address the problem, we need to face this stigma. And find ways of addressing it. And the first step is to give women and girls a platform to disclose about their status and also to talk about HIV. But while progress is made on tackling HIV, the growing threat is TB. It thrives amongst people living with HIV, and there is increasing concern over new drug resistant strains. We now have this emerging epidemic. It’s particularly severe here in KwaZulu-Natal, where we have patients with XDR TB. These are patients with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis. This is TB that is really difficult to treat. And the mortality rate from XDR TB is incredibly high. Improvements made in the fight against HIV have resulted in life expectancy increasing by almost a decade here. But South Africans can still expect to die on average 20 years earlier than most Europeans. And it’ll take a sustained effort on both HIV and TB if that is to change. The BBC is to cut up to 1,000 jobs after revealing a £150 million shortfall in its finances - because with more people watching programmes online, fewer are paying the licence fee. The Director-General Tony Hall said he wanted to see a ""simpler, leaner BBC,"" with most of the job losses coming from management posts. BP has agreed to pay damages of $18.7 billion - the equivalent of £12 billion - to settle claims in the United States over a major oil spill it caused in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. An explosion at the firm’s Deepwater Horizon oil rig killed 11 people, and polluted hundreds of miles of coastline. Our business editor Kamal Ahmed is with me. Does this finally draw a line under this disaster for BP? It certainly has been a brutal five years for one of Britain’s’s biggest businesses. This has been a disaster on so many different levels. Of course, the human tragedy, 11 people were killed, the environmental impact, as you say, hundreds of miles of coast affected. The biggest ever oil spill in American waters. The economic damage to BP, its share price collapsed, it was obliged to sell lots of its businesses. This was a company that used to pay out £1 in every seven of dividends paid to our pension funds before the crisis in 2010. And of course, it had to abandon its dividend payments, so a big impact on the UK economy. And then the political impact. President Obama famously said he wanted to keep his foot on the throat of BP. I spoke to Bob Dudley, the Chief Executive of BP earlier today, and he said he hopes this draws a line under the last five years and now looking forward BP can become an ordinary energy company again. Investors seemed to agree with that and its share price went up by 5p today, which is at least a start towards its normal operation. Many thanks.

The Duke of Cambridge has been among those praising the achievements of the England women’s football team at the World Cup after they went out to japan in the semi-finals played in Canada last night. It was though a crushing end to their campaign - with an own goal from Laura Bassett in the dying seconds of the match. Katie Gornalljoins us now from Edmonton. You have to feel for Laura Bassett. She knows if it had gone to plan for England in the noisy city of Edmonton and they would be heading for Vancouver now for the final. Despite the disappointment there is a sense of pride in this team that they took England further than they have ever been at a World Cup and proved themselves as contenders on the world stage. Sometimes the line between hope and despair can be cruelly exposed. Laura Bassett isn’t the first to fall foul of sport’s fine margins, but for her this was a sickening moment- an own goal at the death that handed japan both victory and a place in the final. Few know what that feels like. While England’s fans can only empathise, today it fell to England’s coach to reflect. She will get through it, no doubt at all. Laura Bassett has been through many challenges in her career. The team have already moved on from that. They know what Laura Bassett brings to this group. She will be a friend, she will be a respected person in this team forever, notjust this tournament. Her worst moment came while playing some of her best football. Bassett has pulled England through some bruising encounters in Canada. For her friends in the team, it all adds to the emotion. She is a great person. And a great team-mate and devastated for her. I hope the country gets behind her and gives her the support and love and appreciation she needs. Many have already shown their support on social media, while some have criticised. For her family back home it has been a lot to take in. I have heard there has been some absolutely positive responses to it, which is wonderful. Negative - we will leave that at the door. She is a mature, educated young woman and she will take it in her stride. The best place to recover mightjust be back here, where England have a third-place play-off against Germany on Saturday. And as they are fond of saying, they want to leave it all on the pitch. ",,

This evening there are reports of progress, but the Greeks would have to pass new laws before a fresh bailout. We’ll have the latest from Brussels and from Athens. Also on the programme: Flowers are laid in memory of the 16-year-old who died after being electrocuted on a railway line in West Yorkshire. Labour’s acting leader, Harriet Harman, says the party won’t oppose the Government’s £12 billion welfare cuts. It’s Djokovic again! And super Novak fends off Federer to win his third Wimbledon title. Good evening. Nerves are on edge and a deal must be done tonight. The word from Brussels as leaders of the 19 Eurozone countries meet to decide Greece’s economic fate. It’s thought they could be edging closer to an agreement which would need to be ratified by the Greek parliament before being implemented. Let’sjoin our Europe Editor, Katya Adler, who is in Brussels. Katya. Well, the Eurozone leaders arrived here today, determined that it was crunch time and be hearing that Greece has agreed to most of its creditor demands but trust is the key issue. Can Eurozone leaders trust Greece to honour any new agreement? The group Parliament is being asked to sign up to reforms this weekend as part of the trust building exercise and it is likely negotiations will go on later into tonight. Can today’s deadline be met or wannabe pushed forward yet again? An emergency summit with grease the focus of attention. And a warning. Today, it said, is the deadline for Greece staying in the Eurozone. You have heard it before. We have heard this before also - have heard it before. We have heard this before also - another bid message from the Greek Prime Minister, despite gloomy mood music. We can reach an agreement tonight, if all the parties wanted. But do they? The situation is extremely difficult. There will be tough talks and there won’t be unity at any price. So why are Eurozone leaders continuing on this merry-go-round? Why don’t theyjust slash Greece’s dead or push it out? The answer? Because they are unsure what to do for the best, Because they are unsure what to do forthe best, notjust Because they are unsure what to do for the best, notjust for Greece but in their own interests. A member, the Eurozone is onlyjust clawing its way out of its 2008 financial crisis. From France to Italy to Germany, politics and economic ‘s are being affected by Greece. And so is unity in the wider EU. Greece says it needs at least 50 ill euros and a restructuring of its debt to get its finances in order. Big powers France and Germany are at odds over whether Greece can be trusted to honour any new agreement. Trust in the Greek government is at at an all-time low. The main obstacle to moving forward is lack of trust so I would like to see the great government take concrete action starting tomorrow in Parliament to prevent measures that are needed for Greece in the first base. The stakes are enormously high. Greece’s banks say they are about to run out of money. The aim tonight is to come up with a compromise, if not a final deal. With so much talk among Eurozone leaders about whether the Greek love and can be trusted, what is a reaction in Athens? Borja Mike Holding, Gavin Hewitt. -- reaction in Athens? Borja Mike Holding, Gavin Hewitt. -- back to my colleague. Near the old Olympics Stadium in Athens, Greeks while away time, a nation in waiting, where there fate, their future, is settled elsewhere. With the discussions I have had with my friends and relatives, I know that they can’t sleep at night. It has been more than two weeks that people do not sleep at night. Sitting at a window, Lucas, aged 84. A ceramic artist fearing the unknown outside the euro. This has been humiliating, he says. I have never seen anything like it. There is no future. The immediate concern here is how to relieve pressure on the banks. They are known to have very low reserves and without a deal, some could fail in the days ahead. We have been told that the banks won’t reopen tomorrow and almost certainly not by the end of the week. And some kind of capital controls will remain in place for several months. A senior government official told me that in any event, the banks will need recapitalising with 10 billion euros. During these negotiations, the economy has been in freefall. 60 businesses are said to be closing each day, with 600 jobs lost. Greeks can only watch as their Eurozone partners question whether they can be trusted. This government MP finds the process demeaning. I most definitely feel that mistrust is a false argument. You cannot mistrust a country. The Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, is widely expected to reshuffle his Cabinet in the coming days, discarding ministers who opposed further cuts. just a week ago, Greeks voted no to further austerity. Now, there is a moment of concessions, hoping to secure a third bailout and remain in the euro. Gavin Hewitt, BBC News, Athens. Europe has a lot on its mind at the moment, it has migrants arriving on the southern shores and an aggressive Russia next door but Greece is the focus of attention. Leaders believe that jamaica’s challengers, Europe needs to be united and ensure that it can overcome its own problems. There is a very real, sincere desire tonight to find some kind of copper mines. But it is far from guaranteed. Carter Adler But it is far from guaranteed. CarterAdler in Carter Adler in Brussels, thank you. -- catcher Adler. A teenager has been electrocuted after climbing on to the roof of a freight train. 16-year-old Kyle Bradley died after touching overhead power lines while on top of the train at Wrenthorpe in West Yorkshire. Peter Harris reports. The police say the teenager had climbed onto one of the freight trains that stops in the sidings beside the line. Coming into contact with power cables above, 16-year-old Kyle Bradley was electrocuted and died beside the track. Tributes placed nearby today by his family, with a warning to others. He slipped, he grabbed a line, he made a mistake like a child does and he has paid for it dearly. I would definitely WBITI against going on traffic lines, I have been talking to my little girl about it and everything. On this side of the line, a private gardens. But on the opposite side is parkland and although it is securely fenced off, somehow the teenagers had made their way through to track-side. And as you can see, once on top of a freight train, they would be perilously close to the power cables. Those living nearby say this is a tragedy they had feared for some time. I have telephoned the police in the past, some years ago, especially about some gates being open further down the field. The padlock was broken. Because, well, the potential is always there, isn’t it? Another 16-year-old boy and a woman of 18 were taken to hospital but later discharged. The Office of Rail Regulation has been informed and will investigate. Peter Harris, BBC News. The Scottish Government has ordered a review of the way police handle calls following the death of a woman who lay injured and undiscovered with her dead boyfriend for three days. Lamara Bell, who was 25, was involved in a car accident with john Yuill on a motorway slip road near Stirling. Earlier this week the Chief Constable of Police Scotland apologised to both families after officers failed to respond to a report last Sunday of the vehicle being off the road. Labour’s acting leader, Harriet Harman, says the party won’t oppose the benefit changes announced by the Government in last week’s Budget. She said Labour would not vote against the Welfare Bill, which would bring £12 billion worth of cuts into force by 2020. The comments have caused dismay among some of the party’s leadership candidates, as our Political Correspondent, Alex Forsyth, reports. The people vying to be Labour’s next leader. Today they were in Newcastle, trying to persuade supporters that after the party’s crushing election defeat, they can shape it into a credible opposition. At the same time, miles away in London, the acting leader was explaining why Labour won’t the opposing all of the Government’s changes to welfare. We have got to recognise why it is the Tories that are in government and not us, which is not because people love the Tories particularly but because they didn’t trust us on the economy and on benefits. We have to listen to that and respond to that and that is why, as I say, we will not be voting against the Welfare Bill. So what is Labour’s stance on welfare? Well, it will support lowering the benefit cap, limiting the amount households can claim. It will agree to restricting some benefits, including tax credits for families with more than two children. And the party won’t oppose the Welfare Bill, which legislates for these and other changes, although it will argue against some elements. For some in Labour strongholds, like Newcastle, it is an unwelcome position from a party they feel is struggling to find its direction. As only a temporary leader, she is basically condoning what the Tories are doing. I think it is awful. We should be opposing those things and I think there is a better way to do it. And I think Labour should be standing up for that better way. Revolt is brewing in Labour’s senior ranks, too. Andy Burnham, the bookies’ favourite for the top job, opposes cuts to child tax credits for new claimants. Contrary to his current leader’s stance. As does veteran left-winger, jeremy Corbyn, who is gaining support in the leadership contest after starting as an outsider. I am very disappointed that Harriet has made this statement. I will be voting against the welfare proposals that were put forward by the Government. So, despite the visible accord, disagreements over Labour’s response to the recent Budget have highlighted wider divisions over the party’s future. Alex Forsyth, BBC News. Nearly half of Army personnel think sexual harrassment and bullying suffered by women in the forces is a serious problem, according to a survey seen by the BBC. The head of the Army, General Sir Nick Carter ,says a change of culture is required to tackle the problem, as our Defence correspondent, jonathan Beale, reports. The British Army has just appointed its first female general. Susan Ridge’s promotion is seen as a sign the Army is moving with the times. But there is plenty to suggest it is still a man’s world. A survey commissioned by the Army shows that many women in uniform continue to be the victims of sexual harassment. Charlotte Beryl served in the Royal Military Police for more than a decade. She left the Army last year. She says she was one of those victims. After sustaining an injury, she put on weight and says she was bullied by male colleagues about her appearance. And, ultimately, it all became too much. I bought... Packets of pa racetamol. And tried to take my own life. Because I felt I didn’t have anybody to talk to. It all happened here at Bulford Camp in Wiltshire and it wasn’t an isolated case. In 2011, Charlotte’s friend, Anne-Marie Ellement, did take her own life. The inquest heard she had suffered months of bullying. This survey commissioned by the head of the Army shows that sexual harassment of women soldiers is still a problem. Nearly 40% of them said they had experienced unwanted comments about their appearance or another nature. 13% of them said they had suffered particularly upsetting experiences. Yet only 3% of those surveyed had made a formal complaint. The figures are totally unacceptable. I am very disappointed by them but they do provide me with the foundation and a baseline against which I can move forward and change the Army’s culture, because essentially this is a problem of culture. The Army is breaking down barriers for women. And General Carter says it will reflect values the show it is inclusive and open to everyone. jonathan Beale, BBC News. At Wimbledon, Novak Djokovic has won his third Wimbledon singles title, beating Roger Federer in four sets this afternoon, ending his opponent’s hopes of a record eighth triumph. Andy Swiss watched the action. The champion against the legend. Roger Federer is no stranger to the incredible, but an eighth Wimbledon title? As fans crossed their fingers, the early signs were encouraging. But while Federer was the sentimental favourite, Novak Djokovic was the bookies’. And come a first set tie-break, he took it. But Federer has fight as well as flair, as he proved in a nerve-shredding second set. Five times he saved set point before edging an epic tie-break. ",,

Don’t you think we were born for this kind of thing? You’re working for me now. There can be no police. Tuppence, do you think we might be out of our depth? How much do you know? Agh! Stop! You have no training. Tommy, what have we got ourselves into? I do believe your pulse has quickened. A brand-new six-part drama - Agatha Christie’s Partners in Crime. A fractious Eurozone summit in Brussels - leaders are divided on Greece’s economic fate. This was to be the decisive day for Greeks’ future in the single currency - but there are splits within the Eurozone - and distrust of Greece. The main obstacles to moving forward is lack of trust. So I would like to see the Greek government to take concrete actions starting tomorrow in Parliament. Greece will now have to pass new laws before any fresh bailout. We’ll be live in Athens - and in Brussels. Also tonight: Scottish police are ordered to review the way calls are handled - after a woman left in a crashed car for three days dies. Sexual harrassment and the army, a survey reveals many service personnel think it’s a serious problem. The figures are totally unacceptable. I am very disappointed by then. But they do provide me with a foundation and a baseline against which I can move forward and change the Army’s culture. And Super Novak wins his third Wimbledon title. Good evening. Eurozone leaders are working late into the night in Brussels - to try and find a way to resolve the Greek debt crisis. There are reports of progress being made - and a draft plan being worked on. But it’s also clear that Eurozone leaders are far from united in their stance on Greece - and in some cases distrustful about whether Athens will play its part. Our Europe editor Katya Adler is following the talks in Brussels and we canjoin her now. Katya. Eurozone leaders were absolutely determined that today was crunch time. But negotiations are ongoing and they are very tough indeed. Trust is a key issue. Can Eurozone leaders trust Greece to implement reforms that it may sign up to in a new deal? With so much at stake here it’s unclear whether that deadline today will be met or whether it will just be pushed forward again. Todayis Today is the deadline for grease stain in the Eurozone, a warning. You’ve heard it before. -- stain in the Eurozone, a warning. You’ve heard it before. -- Greece staying. Another upbeat message from the Prime Minister despite gloomy mood music. We can reach an agreement tonight if all parties wanted. But do they? TRANSLATION: The situation is extremely difficult. There will be tough talks and not unity at any price. Why are they continuing on this merry-go-round, why don’t theyjust lash Greece’s debt or push it out? The answer, they are unsure what to do for the best, notjust The answer, they are unsure what to do for the best, not just for grease, but their own interest. Remember, the Eurozone is onlyjust clawing its way out of the 2008 financial crisis. From France to Italy to Germany, politics and economics are being affected by Greece. And so is unity in the wider EU. Greece says it needs at least 50 billion euros and a restructuring of its debt to get its finances in order. Big powers France and Germany are at odds over whether Greece can be trusted to honour any new agreement. Trust in the Greek government is at an all-time low. The main obstacles to moving forward is lack of trust. So I would like to see the Greek government to take concrete actions starting tomorrow in Parliament. To implement measures that are needed for grease in the first place. The stakes are enormously high. Greece’s banks say they are about to run out of money. The aim tonight is to come up with a comp eyes if not a final deal. With so much talk about lack of trust in the Greek government in Brussels, what has been the reaction in Athens? Near the old Olympic Stadium, Greeks wile away time while their fate and Stadium, Greeks wile away time while theirfate and their their fate and their future is settled elsewhere. The discussions I have with my friends and relatives, I know that they can’t sleep at night. It’s been more than two weeks that people don’t sleep at night. Sitting at a window, Lucas, aged 84. A ceramic artist fearing the unknown outside the euro. This has been humiliating, he says. I’ve never seen anything like it. There is no future. The immediate concern here is how to relieve pressure on the banks. They are known to have very low reserves, and without a deal, some could fail in the days ahead. We’ve been told that the banks won’t reopen tomorrow, and almost certainly not by the end of the week. And some kind of capital controls will remain in place for several months. A senior government official told me that in any event, the banks will need re-capitalising with 10 billion euros. During these negotiations, the economy has been in freefall. 60 businesses are said to be closing each day with 600 jobs lost. Greeks can only watch as they Eurozone partners question whether they can be trusted. Constantine is, government MP, finds the process is demeaning. I most definitely feel that mistrust, you cannot mistrust a country. The Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is widely expected to reshuffle his cabinet in the coming days, discarding ministers who opposed further cuts. just a week ago Greeks voted no to further austerity. Now is the moment of concessions, hoping to secure a third bailout and remain in the euro. We canjoin our economic editor Robert Preston in Athens. As things seem to drag on in Brussels, Robert, what does it mean for the Greek economy, particularly those banks? Well, they won’t be opening tomorrow as Gavin pointed out. Talking to senior bankers here, they are extremely pessimistic about the outlook. Unless the European Central Bank provides more emergency credit to them in the next day or two, and that looks about as likely as a Martian landing as I broadcast. They will not be able to open this week and at some point they’ll have to shrink the amount that they allow Greek people to take out of their accounts from the current 60 euros per account to maybe as little as 20 orIo per account to maybe as little as 20 or Io euros per day. And they are to all intents and purposes bust. The finance ministers calculates they need a capital injection save them of up to 25 billion euros. Now, that is more than twice relative to the size of the Greek economy, more than twice what we put into our spectacularly bust banks to save them back in 2008. So you can see what Dier AIN. They can’t lend, they can’t finance the economy, it is melting down -- can’t finance the economy, it is melting down -- you can see the direst they are in. This is a terrible, terrible catastrophe for this country. But it is looking increasingly extraordinarily damaging for the wider European Union. We thank the spectacle this weekend of the two most important Eurozone countries, Germany and France, at loggerheads over the future of Greece -- France, at loggerheads over the future of Greece -- we’ve had the spectacle. I think that has done damage all over the world to the idea that the Eurozone is a stable collective enterprise by Europe’s leading economies. And I think that we will be paying a price for this crisis in the wider European Union for weeks, crisis in the wider European Union forweeks, months, possibly years crisis in the wider European Union for weeks, months, possibly years to come. Robert Heston in Athens, thank you. Here, the Scottish government has ordered an urgent review into the way all calls to the police are handled, after the death of a woman who was left critically injured in a crashed car for three days. Lamara Bell died in hospital this morning. She was found on Wednesday, despite the incident being reported on Sunday. james Shaw reports. Lamara Bell died in hospital this morning, four days after she was found alongside her partner, john Yuill, who was already dead. Their car crashed off the M9 near Stirling last Sunday. The accident was reported to police but for reasons not yet understood the call was not locked and no officers were sent to the site. It was only three days later that the couple were found and investigations into the crash began. -- investigations into the crash began. -- logged. Lamara Bell’s brother said he wanted people to understand her family ‘s anguish. Now the Scottish Government has ordered a full review of course handling by Police Scotland. -- ordered a full review of course handling by Police Scotland. -- call handling. Some opposition politicians believe a wide enquiry is needed. We need to look at the wider problems of control rooms, centralisation, the target culture that exists, backfilling of staff by officers into civilian roles without the appropriate training. All those issues need to be looked at. There are now three separate enquiries into different aspects of this case. But for the family of Lamara Bell, there isjust one question, would their daughter still be alive if the police had found her when they should have done? Six major world powers including Britain and the United States are understood to be on the brink of announcing a deal with iI’&I’I OVEF its I’IUClâ8I’ pI’OgI’8ITII’|'Iâ. Agreement would end more than a decade of dispute. In a moment- our North America Editorjon Sopel in Washington - but first to Vienna where the talks have been taking place and our Diplomatic Correspondent james Robbins ~ . How certain is it a deal will be done, and how big a moment will it be if it happens? The deal is not quite done yet, let’s be clear. Officials are still working in the Palace hotel behind me where negotiations have been going on day and night, for weeks now, breaking deadlines. Somehow now getting closer to a deal, we think. Their political masters are clear that a deal should be signed by the end of tomorrow. On the surface the real important of that is that it is a disarmament treaty, substantial restrictions on the nuclear programme for Iran, it is committed to excepting those restrictions in return for the progressive lifting of sanctions which have so hobbled the Arabian economy. I think it goes much further than that and I think it really will be historic -- Iranians. After all the poisoned relations with the West following the coming to power of the Ayatollah Kemeny, this offers a new and positive direction, in which perhaps Iran could become a much closer ally of Western powers in their fight against extremism in the Middle East. jon Sopel is standing by in Washington. If this deal is done, what would it mean for President Obama? If and when it would be the signature diplomatic achievement of the Obama Administration, not least for the complexity of some of the issues involved and what is at stake. One senior Administration official close to these talks used an interesting phrase, he said the problem with this deal is that perfect is the enemy of the good. He said a perfect deal is easy to sell, where Tehran walks in, wave the white flag, offers endless concessions, that would be easy to sell. A good dealforged out of copper mines, concession, mind-boggling complex details, very much more so -- mind-boggling complex details, very much more so -- compromise and concession. Obama wants to say this is a good deal, his opponents think otherwise and they are making the running at the moment. It leaves President Obama with a mighty selling job to the American public and the American Congress who must vote on this, and to Israel and Saudi Arabia, who are deeply sceptical. To win those people over he will need to summon all of his persuasive powers.

In a spell-binding final, he beat Roger Federer over four sets to clinch his 3rd centre court title. There was also British success asjordanne Whiley won the ladies wheelchair doubles. Our Sports Correspondent Andy Swiss reports. It was a day of fairy tales foiled by brilliance. A triumph for the bookies favourite rather than the sentimental one. It began with Roger Federer in search of history and as his fans crossed their fingers the early signs were encouraging. But the legend was up against the champion, Novak Djokovic, and his relentless power gave him a first set tie-break. Federerfinished? Far from it, as he proved in a nerve shredding second set. He served set point -- shredding second set. He served set point-- saved shredding second set. He served set point -- saved set point seven times. Caught ecstatic, Djokovic slightly less so. At 1-1, Federer’s dream was on but his form faded and the result was ruthless. Djokovic reeling off the next two sets and the title was his. Not a result for the romantics perhaps but even in triumph Djokovic pays tribute to his opponent. He has done so much for our sport on and off the court and he is definitely somebody that a lot of players from my generation were looking up to him, and following his lead. So it’s a great honour to play you again. And just look what it means to Novak Djokovic and the thousands of fans here. This is his third Wimbledon title, it confirms his status as tennis’s man to beat. Elsewhere there was some Swiss bliss. 17 years after her last Wimbledon title, Martina Hingis picked up her second in two days, winning the mixed doubles with Leander Paes.

151,BBC1 London,9-jul-2015,BBC News at Six,18:00,30 mins,True,"The Chancellor’s changes to welfare in the Budget will take ""much more"" from the poor than the rich, according to experts. 13 million families will lose on average £26O a year- and a new National Living Wage won’t compensate. The cuts in tax credits will hit recipients much harder than anything they will get back from an increase in minimum wage, on average. But the Chancellor insists he is offering a fair deal. Also tonight: Going nowhere - London’s tube trains at a standstill as workers stage a one-day strike. Three days in their crashed car before police came to help - the driver who was killed - and his passenger who’s critically injured.

And she’s done it again - Serena Williams cruises to her eighth Wimbledon final after beating rival Maria Sharapova. And on Reporting Scotland: And the tube strike means it’s no easier getting home. It’s all over running the tubes late at weekends. Now the Mayor says the dispute could delay it. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. The Chancellor’s welfare changes in the Budget will leave poorer households losing ""much more significantly"" than richer households - according to leading public finance experts. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says that 13 million families will lose an average of £26O a year, and that three million will lose an average of £1,000 a year. The IFS says the creation of a compulsory living wage won’t be enough to make up for their losses. But George Osborne said he was offering the country a ""new contract"" - with workers getting higher pay but fewer benefits. Here’s our Economics Editor Robert Peston. Time to recharge, between Valerie’s work in a Bristol library and the pressures of being a single mother and bring up two of these. She told the BBC before the budget that tax creditsjust about keep her family above water so how does she feel now she knows George osborne’s cuts? We cannot give that much more. And we are going to have to do. It is very, very hard to see that happening to mY very hard to see that happening to my friends and the people I care about. And not happening to the people who can most afford to bear the brunt of this. So in yesterday’s budget, who is hardest hit by the tax and benefit changes? Well as you can see those whose living standards will suffer worst - by a wide margin are the poorest 40% of people - with those in the income group just above the worst off 10% suffering the biggest income fall. That said, there is a hit to the richest 10% - from the reduction in tax relief they receive on pension contributions. But this doesn’t take account of the introduction of the living wage. That will raise incomes of those at the bottom by ile billion by 2020. But that is just a third of the £12 billion being taken away from millions of families and people by the tax credit and other benefit cuts. What is also striking, according to the IFS, is that one of the big reforms may make work pay less than a life on benefits. One of the particular choices the Chancellor made, to reduce these things called working allowances within the new universal credit system actually, a lot of people, certainly those who do not have working partners, will have reduced their incentives to go into work cause it reduces the amount they can earn before they start losing their benefits. Here is the most shocking post-election change. No hi viz jackets. This budget offers a new contract for the country, it says to businesses that you need to pay higher wages but there will be lower business taxes. Or people there will be bigger paycheques for the national living wage but less wealthier. And for the country, the country will spend less but live within its means. If you hurt people who are trying to do their best, getting into work, want are going to implement but will have the rug pulled from underneath them that is not going to reduce the welfare bill. It is self-defeating, a false economy. Now it is the supermarket to some in the government have attacked for paying too little by taking advantage of government tax subsidies. But Tesco says it welcomes the living wage. Our Deputy Political editorjames Landale is in Downing Street. George Osborne appeared to be riding high yesterday, how much of a blow will this analysis be? Budgets have always looked slightly different the day after and certainly the IFS analysis poses some tough questions. George Osborne says the budget was for working people but they say the people he is hitting the hardest are the working poor and he is creating disincentives for unemployed people to look for work. On one level what the IFS says is not that surprising, if you are going to introduce £12 billion of welfare cuts, which were voted for at the last election, it will have an impact. But the response from number 11 is pretty robust, they say the IFS is ignoring lots of other measures in the budget, tax cuts, free childcare, the national living wage. They are standing firm behind their position. With the classic period of 21+ hours after a budget, the independent experts saying they have found some holes and the Treasury saying they are standing firm, they think these reforms are important and will have popular support. Millions of commuters are facing a difficult journey home this evening as the entire London Underground network is shut because of strike action. Tube workers are in dispute over plans to keep the trains running all night. There’s also been a walkout by First Great Western staff over maintenance and how many staff are needed on trains. Our Transport Correspondent Richard Westcott is at Kings Cross Station for us now. Crush hour in London. The next train is due... On Friday morning. It normally takes Ben Gladstone one hour to reach work. Today, it would take more than twice that long. First, an overground train. How are you feeling? Clammy, hot and sweaty. Then, it’s on to two different busses. I have a little bit of sympathy. But at the same time, if I go on strike I don’t hold the whole of London to ransom. All lined up and nowhere to go. These trains should have been carrying 1+ million passengers today. That is nearly four times the population of Birmingham. The strike comes down to a row over new all-night services due to start in September. It will mean far more night shifts and weekends for workers. London Underground is offering a 2% pay rise for all staff, plus cash lump sums for those working on a night tube line. Everyone will get £500. Drivers will get £2000. Nurses work overnight. Policemen work overnight. They haven’t got a pay deal like this. They might be looking at that and saying, how dare you hold a city to ransom with such a good deal on the table? Members are saying the most important thing is not the money. This is genuinely not about the money. Our members, it is about quality of life and having change negotiated, not imposed upon them. In a double whammy for train travellers, there is also a separate two day strike on First Great Western services to the south-west of England and south Wales. It is a row over who maintains and staffs new high-speed trains due in a few years. It caught out a few visiting cricket fans off to the test in Cardiff. There is a chance we will catch a train, but it is not set. Back to Ben’s commute, and after two and a quarter hours he has finally made his office. Now time to turn around and do the whole thing again. You can see You CBFI SEE ‘fI’oITI behind me, everything is still shot but it is very busy. I have just had a text message from Bain, he left work about an hour ago and he said he is still walking. Bad news in terms of the strike, you heard me talking to the man from the drivers union, when I asked if you could guarantee there would be no future strikes, the talks are being very fractious, they have not got on well at all, and he could not give me that guarantee.

It’s unclear exactly how many people have been involved but the Co-op has 2800 stores and 200 filling stations and all could have been affected and any type of debit or credit card could have been used.

Police in Scotland are facing severe criticism after a couple were left in their crashed car for three days. The driver had died and his female passenger was critically injured. Officers admitted failing to act on reports of the incident near Stirling on Sunday - and not attending the scene until yesterday. The injured woman’s family say they’re disgusted at what’s happened. Lorna Gordon isjust outside Stirling. john Yuill and Lamara Bell had been on a camping trip, returning home on this stretch of motorway when their car left the road. It was reported by a member of the public early on Sunday but never fully investigated by police. There is a lot of anger and questions being asked by politicians and by relatives, questioning why it took police so long to act. At the edge of the motor way, long to act. At the edge of the motorway, in motor way, in the centre of Scotland, are slow, meticulous search for evidence after a young couple, reported missing by both their families, couple, reported missing by both theirfamilies, lay undiscovered in their car at theirfamilies, lay undiscovered in their carat the their car at the side of the road for three days. The two word john Yuill and Lamara Bell, for three days. The two word john Yuilland Lamara Bell, he Yuill and Lamara Bell, he was driving and was killed in the crash, she was the passenger and was critically injured with severe dehydration and broken bones. Relatives and locals are questioning why police failed to investigate a call reporting the accident which was made at the weekend. Everybody is shocked I think. People are upset and might be angry that it they were waiting for three days and nothing was done about it. Totally shocked. The whole community is totally shocked. In a statement Police Scotland said: Lamara Bell is being treated at this hospital in Glasgow, she is said to be in a coma, in a critical but stable condition. There will be an independent investigation as to why police took three days to find her and john Yuill. The families left angry and distressed, asking why a call about the crash was apparently ignored or never passed on. In the last few minutes the Foreign Office hasissued last few minutes the Foreign Office has issued some travel advice for those intending to travel to Tunisia. james Robins has the latest. I havejust been Tunisia. james Robins has the latest. I have just been talking to the Foreign Secretary, is made a statement and took some questions, but he has made it clear that the Foreign Office has upgraded its travel advice, advising against all but essential travel. That means the Foreign Office is urging all 2500, to 3000 holiday-makers in Co-op to return home. He said he was confident operators had enough capacity to bring the holiday-makers out and those travelling independently could come home by recognised conventional carriers. Nevertheless this is a serious development, the Foreign Secretary told me that although new intelligent assessments did not point to a specific threat, nonetheless they thought another attack in Tunisia was highly likely. Thank you, james Robinson. Our top story this evening: The Chancellor is welfare changes in the budget will ease poor households losing much more significantly than richer households according to leading public finance experts. And I am here at Wimbledon Later on BBC London: Footballerjunior Dian collapsed and died during a pre-season friendly. Now his friends have launched a fundraising campaign to pay for his funeral. And tennis star Greg Rudzetski gives London schoolchildren his top tips on getting to Wimbledon. isjamie Murray, is jamie Murray, he The Amazon is the world’s largest tropical rainforest, home to thousands of plant and animal species. In recent years, efforts to stop it being cut down by illegal loggers who supply the global timber industry have met with some success. The amount of land affected has gone down from more than 10,500 square miles in 2001+ to less than 1,800 square miles last year. But now there’s some evidence of a new surge in the crime. Our correspondent Wyre Davies travelled to the state of Mato Grosso, and he sent this special report. Guns drawn over the rainforest. The Amazon is yet again the front line between Brazil’s environmental police and those who see this vast wilderness as a resource there for the taking. In recent years, Brazil significantly reduced deforestation rates, releasing figures which suggest that illegal logging and the clearing of forest areas has risen sharply. On the ground, agents take on the illegal loggers, detaining suspects, destroying their camps and equipment. The fight to save the Amazon, a fight against organised crime. TRANSLATION: You can compare it to the fight against drugs trafficking. The crime and the criminals keep on adapting. They are getting even more sophisticated, using even bigger tools for deforestation. Satellite is a crucial tool. The pink area, what was just days ago virginjungle. Being wiped out in no time, even as we flew in. This is one of the most destructive forms of deforestation in the Amazon. In this case, huge fields of trees, acres and acres, are felled in a couple of days or a couple of weeks. What they do, they tie a huge chain between two tractors. The tractors then drag the chain across the field, and they fell everything in its path. All that is left here now are a few tree trunks. New monthly figures from some parts of Brazil show that deforestation rates have almost doubled compared to last year. Those statistics also show that it is from protected indigenous reserves that increasing amounts of wood are being illegally taken. These villagers from the Cinta Larga mainly live off and in the forest - the forest and the people which have been forgotten, says Amadeus. ""The loggers come here for the valuable hardwoods that have already been lost elsewhere,"" says the student. ""That is why the pressure on our land is so strong."" Limited logging is permitted under licence, but in some areas, it’s thought that as much as 80% of the timber felled is done so illegally. No country has done more than Brazil to reduce previously rampant levels of deforestation. But there’s constant economic pressure to make more of the Amazon and the future of this unique wilderness remains unresolved. A decade after it became illegal, MPs are to vote next week on changing the law on fox hunting in England and Wales. If passed it would allow more dogs to be used to flush out but not kill a fox, in line with what happens in Scotland. Labour says ministers are trying to ""wreck"" the hunting ban, but the Government says it is responding to the concerns of hill farmers. Our rural affairs correspondent Claire Marshall sent this report from the Brecon Beacons. These hounds haven’t been allowed to hunt openly as a pack for more than one decade. Only two of them should be used to chase a fox out of hiding. They are meant to follow fake scent trails across the Welsh hills. Farmers say foxes have thrived, and that three quarters of farms have lost more sheep. Now the ban may be relaxed and the whole pack could be used. Farmers would be absolutely delighted to get back to where they were pre-ban, and be in a position to control foxes and protect their lands. It is just as simple as that. The fox should be shot, as happens in Scotland, rather than the hounds be allowed to kill it. So, this could mean that these hounds, and hundreds of other packs across the UK, are finally allowed to do what they were bred to do, which is to help kill foxes. The Hunting Act was passed despite huge protests in London. It took some 700 hours of Parliamentary time. Many Tory MPs want it scrapped. However, it is much easier to amend it. It will take 90 minutes of debate, and if passed by the House of Lords, it could come into force by the end of the year. Animal welfare groups say the amendment would smash a hole in the Hunting Act. This is what is behind this move. It is the hunt lobby are wanting to take us back to the days before the ban when hunting was a free for all. Where it was perfectly legal for a pack of hounds to chase a deer, a hare, a fox across open countryside for hours and hours to the point the animal is exhausted. So they could all be on the trail of a fox by the next hunting season. The debate, as bitter as ever, will now be played out in Parliament next week. The head of the inquiry looking into decades of child sexual abuse has warned that no-one will be exempt from scrutiny, ""no matter how apparently powerful"" they are. justice Lowell Goddard also referred to estimates suggesting one in 20 children in the UK has been a victim of abuse as evidence of the ""sheer scale"" of the problem. Our home affairs correspondent june Kelly is here. That gives us some indication of the judge’s task? The figure relates to all known victims of child abuse in England and Wales, including when the abuser is in the family. justice Lowell and her team have a massive task. Today she laid out the structure of how she is going to run her enquiry. Give you some stats, the running cost of the Ist year of the enquiry loan, the budget is nearly EI8,000,000. Thejudge said the hope is that the enquiry will finish its work by the end of 2020. This enquiry will look at all aspects of society, political institutions, educational establishments, the Armed Forces. When it comes to people who have been abused, they are not represented on the main enquiry panel. Some people are not happy about that. But eight people have been selected for a victims and survivors panel which will advise the enquiry. Thank you. England continued their batting recovery in Cardiff, making 1+30 in the 1st innings of the Ashes. Very little to choose between the sides, a short time ago Australia were 258-5. I’m just glad to be the I2th man today. I2th man, my mum is proud of me, and that’s all that matters. All sorts of supporters in Cardiff. The cricket is so close to the city, you can walk to the ground. Orjust keep going for the circus. Believing you’re ten feet tall is batting psychology. Stuart Broad has been brave enough to admit he’s been affected by being hit so he knew what was coming. More toil for fast bowler Mitchell johnson as Moeen Ali made 77. England ended up with 1+30. No wickets for Mitch. Time now for the home side to bowl, and of course luckily these days England have their greatest ever bowler to call on. This is howjames Anderson does it. David Warner gone, well held by the captain, Alastair Cook. With Steve Smith batting, Cook stood himself somewhere else to catch. just there, in fact. At 37, Chris Rogers is part of Australia’s Dad’s Army. Not normally prone to panic. But were there nerves on 95? He fell, a first Ashes wicket for Mark Wood. Australia passed 200, but that is the captain Clarke out. On the balance of the Ashes, Moeen Ali had just seized the initiative. In tennis, Serena Williams has gone through to her eighth Wimbledon ladies’ singles final after beating rival Maria Sharapova in straight sets. She will face Spain’s Garbine Muguruza in the final on Saturday. Our sports correspondent Andy Swiss watched the action. Slugging it out, two heavyweights of tennis. If it had been billed as a title fight, what followed seemed more of a mismatch. The Williams walloped at its belting best as she cruised to the 1st set, 6-2. Finally, though, Sharapova stirred, as the drama and the decibels rose. But it proved only a brief comeback, as Williams sealed it in style. She already holds the 3 other major titles, but talk of the so-called Serena slam is still off-limits. I feel really good just to be in another final. feel really good just to be in anotherfinal. Really well done, and the Serena slam... I’m not going to mention it! At least I made it to the final, that’s pretty good. She will play Spain’s Garbine Muguruza, after a bizarre ending to her match. Agnieszka Radwanska thought this shop was out, after shouts from her own team. She stopped playing. -- this shot. The review showed it was in.

That’s all from the BBC News at Six. ",,
153,BBC1 London,9-jul-2015,BBC News at Ten,22:00,25 mins,True,"Tonight at Ten: All British people in Tunisia are advised to leave immediately because of the terrorist threat. There are more than 3,000 British nationals in the country - the warning from the Foreign Office is that another terrorist attack is highly likely. Last month in Sousse, 30 British tourists were among the 38 shot dead by an Islamist gunman, and the threat hasn’t gone away. Since the attack in Sousse. The intell picture developed considerably leading us to the view that a terrorist attack is highly likely. We’ll have more detail on the intelligence that’s led to the warning and advice for those who were intending to travel. Also tonight: Millions of families will be worse off because of the benefit changes in the Budget, according to public finance experts. In Athens, crowds gather as Greece hasjust a few more hours to present a new reform package to its creditors. In the capital of South Carolina, the Confederate flag, a symbol of slavery and racism to many, is to be taken down within hours. And at Wimbledon, Serena Williams has reached the women’s Singles Final for the eighth time. On BBC London: The biggest tube strike in over a decade comes to an end but has it delayed the introduction of the night tube? And, plans for a street party on The Mall- to celebrate the Queen’s 90th birthday next year. Good evening. British people in Tunisia, including tourists and residents, have been given the strongest warning by the Foreign Office to leave the country as soon as posisble. the country as soon as posslble. Phillip Hammond, the Foreign Secretary, said another terrorist attack was considered to be highly likely. 30 British citizens were among those shot dead in the resort of Sousse last month. The Foreign Office says no British citizen should travel to Tunisia unless it’s absolutely essential. Our Security Correspondent Frank Gardner has the latest. Tunisia’s resorts but the British Government has concluded that the measures are not enough. As many as 3,000 Britons are still in the country after last month’s terrorist attack. The Foreign Office now assesses the risk to them is unacceptably high, it is telling them to leave. Since the attack in Sousse, the intelligence and the threat picture has developed considerably, leading us to the view that a further terrorist attack is highly likely. The Tunisian investigation into those behind the attack in Tunisia and that on the Bardo Museum is ongoing and the Tunisians have made clear that they want to track down further individuals that they suspect may have links to the attack. In other words, the Islamist gunman who murdered 38 tourists was not acting alone. His associates believed to be still at large in Tunisia, quite likely to be looking for targets. At the time of the Sousse attack, some, including a former policeman, were sewer that they saw a second attacker. We saw a guy with red swimming shorts with a gun, walking to the hotel area. We saw bodies on the terrace to the left and on to the right and people were running away from this man who was walking down towards the pool and the beach. Tunisia is border with Libya, it is the country’s Achilles heel. Far from this crossing point, there are numerous places where smugglers and terrorists can cross unseen. Tunisia says it will build a wall but only halfway. Across the border, meanwhile, Libya is in chaos. With no effective government, it is awash with guns, militias and the growing presence of ISIS, the self-pro claimed Islamic State. They are training jihadis claimed Islamic State. They are trainingjihadis to go claimed Islamic State. They are training jihadis to go back home and kill Westerners. Hence the travel alert from the Foreign Office. Tourists left in droves after the Sousse attack, now the tour operators have to bear the cost of bringing home those still there. Thomas Cook said it was re-patriating British and Irish holiday-makers this weekend. Some said that they would rather stay. We have felt safe while we are here. There are police patrol boats, there are police, stopping people with bags. You don’t feel the presence all the time but are aware that they are there to protect us. Fortune Issa’s tourist industry, this announcement is a hammer blow. Thomas Cook and TIY have cancelled all trips. Tunisia will have to work hard to prove it is a safe destination. What was the intelligence to the warning? The intelligence was overwhelming to the teams out there, to the threat that the Tunisians were not really on top of it, despite their efforts. The problem being the long porous border. And Libya is in a state of collapse. So despite the measures on the beaches, there are still people able to cross at will. They are coming from the training camps, they are trained in firearms, access to extremist ideology and training and then they slip back into the country. There is also a slightly porous border to the west with Algeria. Given that, it was a reluctant decision, I understand, this is bad fortune Issa, Tunisia is an ally that Britain wants to help but they felt that the tourists could not be protected, therefore they had a responsibility to bring them home. Britain is leaving in place a number of teams discreetly, to help the Tunisians build up their capacity, so that the hope is by the autumn there will be enough security measures in place to be able to bring people back. It is a lovely place and a popular destination. Thank you very much. The changes to benefits, set out in yesterday’s Budget, mean millions of families will be worse off, according to public finance experts at the Institute for Fiscal Studies. They say the Government was ‘plain wrong’ to argue that the introduction of what’s called a National Living Wage would compensate for cuts to tax credits. But the Chancellor George Osborne said he was offering people a ‘new contract’ of higher pay and lower taxes in return for welfare cuts. Our Economics Editor Robert Peston reports. A certificate of good behaviour, so would single mum, Nicola Marshal, award one to the Chancellor, after his cuts to tax credits? Working age benefits will be frozen. That will affect me for four years. In real terms that is a cut. You know, my daughter is II. She is getting very expensive. Secondary school, prices of food, everything seems to be always going uP’ Petrol, I need petrol to go to work, so all of that sort of thing means I am constantly worrying about money. So in yesterday’s Budget, who is the hardest-hit by the tax and the benefit changes? As you can see, those whose living standards that will suffer worst by a wide margin are the poorest 40% of people. With those in the income groupjust above the worst off, 10%, suffering the biggest income fall. That said, there is a hit to the richest 10% from the reduction in the tax relief that they receive on pension contributions. But this doesn’t take account of the introduction of the Living Wage. That will raise incomes of those at the bottom by ill billion by 2020. just a third of the £12 billion being taken away from millions of families and people by the tax credit and other benefit cuts. Now what is also striking, according to the IFS, is that one of the big reforms may make work pay less than a life on benefits. One of the particular choices that the Chancellor made, which is to reduce these things called working allowances within the new Universal Credit system, actually, for a lot of people, certainly those who don’t have working partners, will have reduced their incentives to go to work as it reduces the amount that they can earn before they start losing their benefit. Here is the most shocking post election change. No hi-visjacket. This Budget offers a new contract for the country. It says to businesses you have to pay higher wages but there will be lower business taxes. For people, bigger pay cheques with the new national living wage but less welfare and for the country it is a country that will spend less but live within its means. If you hurt people trying to do their best, getting into work, they want to work, to have unemployment but will have the rug pulled from underneath them, that is not going to, ultimately, reduce the Welfare Bill, it is self-defeating. It is a false economy. Now it is the supermarkets that some in the government have attacked by paying too little by taking advantage of the Government’s tax credit subsidies. However, Tesco says it welcomes the new Living Wage, even though it will increase its costs. Every little does not hurt... too much. Yesterday’s Budget was one of the most wide-ranging for many years, including changes to pensions, benefits, student finance and government spending. So we asked three colleagues - our business editor, our health editor and our deputy political editor - to analyse the impact of the Budget 24 hours on, and we start with Kamal Ahmed. Like the proverbial curate’s egg, this was a Budget for business that was good in parts. On the positive side came the cut in corporation tax, the new help for apprenticeships. Slightly trickier, the national living wage - a new cost for business, and a supertax on banks - the City won’t welcome that, and then two dogs that resolutely didn’t bark in this Budget, no details of business rate reform and also nothing much on productivity. We may hear more about that tomorrow. For the NHS, the Government announcement of a 1% ceiling on annual wage increases in the public sector is highly significant. Earlier this year there was nearly a strike over pay after a few years of wage restraint. Employers are warning today it will be hard to manage the process, at a time when they’re trying to negotiate seven day a week working. NHS chiefs in England have said that pay should be allowed to rise in line with the overall economy, in order to retain and recruit staff. The Government line is that more money is being invested in health, £8 billion a year extra by 2020. Even so, further restraint is still needed. But at a time of major change ahead in the NHS, the issue of pay could prove to be a real sticking point. Budgets always look different in the cold light of day. The analysis by the independent experts, the IFS, pose some tough questions for George Osborne. He says this Budget is for working people. But they say he is hitting the working poor hardest, and that he is reducing incentives for the unemployed to find work. But I don’t think they will be too dismayed inside there. They think that the IFS is missing the other side of the coin. The free childcare, the tax cuts, the national living wage. They also think that voters actually support the idea that welfare spending is unsustainable and has to be reduced. So they think this Budget will set out the reforms that will get the economy on the right track over the next five years. just in time perhaps, for the Chancellor to have a crack at moving next door. james La ndale there, james Landale there, ending the three views of the impact of the Budget, this hours on. Greece hasjust a couple of hours to hand in its new budget proposals to secure more bailout funds from its international creditors. The German Chancellor Angela Merkel has once again ruled out a revaluation of Greece’s loans - what’s called a haircut in finance circles. For the latest let’s go live to Athens and our chief correspondent Gavin Hewitt. It was confirmed that the Greek proposals had been received by officials in Brussels. At the heart of the proposals, steep rises in VAT and an end to early retirement. The proposals will be assessed by officials, by finances ministers, and a final verdict will be taken at a European summit in Brussels on Sunday. Crowds poured into central Athens this evening to demand Greece stayed in the euro, while just a few streets away, the Greek Cabinet was approving proposals it hoped would deliver a third bailout. These protesters were edgy, even threatening to remain here until the government secured a deal to stay in the euro. We’re not going to leave until he makes a deal, because it is about our future, about our children, about the next ten generations. It’s going to be awful. There was boiling frustration here, but their futures were at risk. Our welfare, our well-being, our lives are at stake. You know, the banks are closed, we can’t get our money out, we’ve worked for it, all our lives. Nearby at the Prime Minister’s office, the Cabinet raced to meet a deadline to submit a reform plan of tax rises and cuts in exchange for a bailout to save the country from bankruptcy. This is where the Cabinet has been learning about the latest Greek proposal. With previous plans there were sticking points - over pensions, VAT rises and tax increases. But because of the deteriorating economy, we understand that this latest proposal may well be tougher than the one submitted before the referendum. Greece must wait to see if its plan convinces Europe’s finance ministers, but as important will be whether the Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, can sell a tougher package back home. The key for him is that senior European officials are beginning to accept that debt relief has to be on the agenda. The realistic proposal from Greece will have to be matched by an equally realistic proposal on debt sustainability from the creditors. Debt restructuring, perhaps, but the German Chancellor made clear that a debt write-off was not being considered. TRANSLATION: I’ve said that a classic haircut is out of the question for me, and that hasn’t changed between yesterday and today. Talk of debt relief may help sell any potential deal, but if it happens, it’ll come with more austerity. There is an irony in all of this. The combination of tax rises and spending cuts amounts to about 13 billion euros is, we understand. That’s actually more than the proposal which was rejected by the people in a referendum here last Sunday will stop Alexis Tsipras will claim that in exchange for this, they will be getting a lot more funding, but even so it will be a very hard sell here over the next 24 to 48 hours. Millions of commuters faced a difficultjourney home, as the entire London Underground network shut down because of strike action. Tube workers are in dispute over plans to keep the trains running all night. Services will resume tomorrow morning. There’s also been a walk-out by First Great Western staff over maintenance and how many workers are needed on trains. Relatives of a couple who were left in a crashed car near Stirling for three days say they are ""disgusted"" that police failed to follow up a phone call reporting the accident. The 28-year-old driver was pronounced dead at the scene, but the passenger, 25-year-old Lamara Bell, survived and is in a critical condition in hospital. The theft of sensitive information, which US authorities are blaming on Chinese hackers, is far worse than previously thought. The initial cyber crime was thought to affect four million individuals - but it’s now said to be closer to 25 million. The people affected include people who applied for security clearance, including current and former federal workers. Our North America editorjon Sopel is in Washington. 25 million, what kind of scale is that compared to previous crimes? Well, it is huge. This is the office for personnel management and it’s the human relations department for the whole of the US federal government. They seem to be saying, you know how we told you last month it was 4.5 million people who had been hacked, what we actually meant to say was its 25 million. This is thing to print details, Social Security numbers, their background security checks, staff and spouses, everything was stolen. What really concerns cyber security experts is what else might have gone as well. Are their passwords that link to far more vital security systems? It has been -- more vital security systems? It has been -- the finger has been pointed at the Chinese. They have said that is irresponsible and counter-productive, but tonight, the office has said there is no information to suggest that any of this information has been used or passed on. The inquiry into child sexual abuse which was set up a year ago has finally started, with a pledge from the presiding judge that no-one will be allowed to obstruct the investigation. Lowell Goddard said it would be ""the most ambitious public inquiry"" ever undertaken in England and Wales, looking at allegations of serious child abuse by high-profile figures in entertainment, politics, the intelligence services and the police. Our home affairs correspondent june Kelly reports. The Savile scandal was the start, then the crimes committed in towns like Rotherham emerged. And as the backstreet operators were convicted, so too were the big names who fell from grace. Today, the New Zealand judge brought in to head the child sex abuse inquiry focused on the past and present. Estimates suggest that one child in every 20 in the United Kingdom has been sexually abused. The true picture may be even worse than the current figures indicate. justice Goddard’s inquiry will examine all areas of society and will take evidence in public and private. She’s written to more than 240 institutions, instructing them not to get rid of any documents. No one, no matter how apparently powerful, will be allowed to obstruct our enquiries into institutionalfailings and no one will have immunity from scrutiny by virtue of their position. The judge and her team will take advice from people who have been abused and want to play a part in the inquiry, but other campaigners are angry that survivors are not on the main panel. They won’t be able to question the witnesses, they won’t be able to see all the material, so where does it stand? It’s a bit like the children’s table at the dinner party. So a year after it was set up we now have the details of how the inquiry is going to be run. justice Goddard acknowledged that the task ahead was daunting and she said that as well as investigating what has happened in the past the inquiry had to establish an enduring legacy for future generations. She said it was the inherent right of every child to experience a childhood free of sexual abuse and intimidation. The House of Representatives in South Carolina has voted to take down the Confederate flag from the grounds of the state capitol after a bitterly-contested debate. The flag, dating from the American civil war, is seen by many as an emblem of slavery and racism. Others insist it represents the richness of US heritage. The flag is due to be removed in the next 24 hours. Let’s join our correspondent Nick Bryant in Columbia. In the past hour, the Governor of South Carolina has signed that will into law, and the flag will finally be lowered at a ceremony on Friday morning. It’s been the subject of a fierce national debate for decades. So this isn’tjust fierce national debate for decades. So this isn’t just an important moment for South Carolina. It’s a milestone moment for American race relations. Thank you, South Carolina, it’s coming down. This was a day that many South Carolinians thought they’d never live to see. It’s a beautiful day to be in South Carolina. Thank you very much. A vote in the state capitol to bring down the Confederate battle flag, a move unthinkable before the massacre in Charleston. I am feeling ecstatic, Ijust got off work and I’m glad to be part of history being made and the oppression stops here. We want to start the rise. Thank you. What some cling to as an emblem of their heritage is viewed by others as a fabric drenched with hate and the debate that has raged for decades continued here today. That flag was not put up there in 1960 whatever as a symbol of unity, they put it up there to block desegregation. In the very beginning it represented too big a government, too high taxes, that’s what it was all about. Really? But these are the images that have changed so many minds. Dylann Roof, the alleged killer in the Charleston shooting, brandishing the colours with pride. But as lawmakers debated into the early hours of the morning, the outcome of the vote was far from certain, and passions were hard to contain. I cannot believe that we do not have the heart in this body to do something meaningful, such as take a symbol of hate off these grounds on Friday. But the vote passed, much to the fury of diehards. It’sjust wrong. God wouldn’t allow this, will he? God wouldn’t want this flag to come down for nobody. It’s not hatred, it’s not racism, however you want to say that word... We’re all one. South Carolina was where the first shots of the American civil war rang out. It was the first state to leave the union. So it is tempting to see the lowering of the flag almost as an act of final surrender. # This land is your land, this land is my land #. So today it wasn’t the blues they were singing, or the protest anthems of the ‘60s, but, instead, a song of unity. # This land was made for you and me #.

That’s all from us. Don’t forget a first look at the papers over on the BBC News channel. But now on BBC One, it’s time for the news where you are. Good evening. I’m Riz Lateef. The biggest Tube strike in over a decade ended this evening. But the 2li-hour walkout means that services still remain suspended until the morning. The Mayor has not ruled out the intro-Dukes of an all-night tube station and at the weekends. Our Transport Correspondent Tom Edwards is at King’s Cross station, how have commuters coped? The tube is still shut. This is the Euston road, still extremely busy and every bus that goes along here is absolutely packed. This has been a really tough day for getting around the capital. This was a day of queues, crushes and much longer journeys than usual. Sometimes tempers frayed. As Londoners struggled to get to work and to get home again. It is horrible trying to get to work. Awful. I live in Essex. It is really, really difficult. Forwork, I am completely late. It is very sad. That people should strike now, why not in the holiday season? At Victoria, a long wait for a bus. At Liverpool Street and every other mainline station, if you could get on it was hot and a squeeze. Wood Green, the number29 was on it was hot and a squeeze. Wood Green, the number 29 was packed before 6.00am. It has taken an hour to get from Victoria to here. What was the route like? Packed. On the roads, traffic was terrible. And at the heart of the dispute is a plan for the night Tube, that the Mayor wants. Although the planned start date did seem a surprise. I am not aware of a deadline. It was always September the 12th, thatis It was always September the 12th, that is what everyone was told? Well... Let’s get, if we can go ahead by September the 12th, that is to the good. I think it would be disgraceful if the union leadership continue in their pig-headed, bone-headed obstructionism and don’t put this offer to their wider membership. As this promotional video show, the night tube is meant to start on September the 12th it means 24 hour trains on Fridays and Saturdays on five lines. But the unions have concerns about too many night and weekend shifts and have walked out on strike. In the background there is proposed Government legislation, requiring a higher turn-out in ballots, so it is harder to go on strike. It seems that the politics is in the way? We are not an industrial trade union, we are acting to stop our staff working the roasters from hell. This is not an issue of money but about work/life balance. That has been made clear. There is a deal on the table. A 2% PHY There is a deal on the table. A 2% pay rise and a £5 Huns bows for the station staff on night tube lines. And £2,000 extra for drivers at depots affected. It is a lack of engagement and true Association. We have put offers on the table. We revised that offer on Monday. There has been no response despite making the offer available on Monday, extending it through Monday evening to Tuesday when at ACAS. We have had no response to the offer. Poor industrial relations have not helped in the dispute. The bad news is that the issues are some way from being resolved. There have been interesting developments today. The Mayor has not ruled out this project slipping. The night tube actually being delayed. Also London Underground want ACAS, the Conciliation Service to facilitate more talks and the TSSA, the moderate of the unions involved, it wants further negotiations. But still a long way off this being sorted out. Tom, from kings kroshgs thank you. A huge street party is to be held on the Mall next year to mark the Queen’s 90th birthday. More than 10,000 people willjoin Her Majesty - for the celebration which is being organised by her grandson Peter Phillip. Wendy Hurrell has more. Over the years, we have become accustomed to a right royal knees up courtesy of Her Majesty The Queen. We have been showing appreciation since the Silverjubilee in 1977. The Queen is worth it! We missed the Coronation, so we thought we would come to the jubilee. thejubilee. It’s only once, isn’t it! I was too young for the last one and I’ll be too old for the next one! The next-but-one being that wetjune day in 2012, but we still had fun. And in between, there was a royal wedding. Always at the centre of the celebrations, the street party. Now, for the biggest one of all. This is how The Mall will look on june 12th next year. 10,000 guests, many of them from charities and organisations the Queen has supported in her 63-year-long reign. This is all about the Queen’s patronage. It is reflecting the commitment she has made to them over the last 63 years and it is a chance for them to celebrate her. You could be there in person, as there is going to be a public ballot. Other members of the Royal family will be there of course and the patrons’ lunch will be just a small part of the weekend festival. London does not need much encouragement for red, white and blue flag waving and cake baking, does it? Time for me to wish you goodnight, and leave you with Tomasz Schafenaker for the forecast. Good weather for a semi-final? Fingers crossed there is a bit of rain on Sunday but we should get away with it. As far as tomorrow is concerned, a beautiful day. A nice one, hot in the centre of London. Lots of dry weather tonight. the centre of London. Lots of dry weathertonight. First thing in the centre of London. Lots of dry weather tonight. First thing in the morning, the temperatures hovering at 14 Celsius. Yesterday promising you southerly winds, that is what is happening, so the forecast is unchanged. The warm winds from France, bringing the temperatures up to 27 Celsius or 8 Celsius in the centre of London, staying gorgeous and sunny. Then the weekend going downhill, Saturday should be a lovely day. Temperatures getting up to about 23 Celsius. But a few clouds appearing now that is the trend of things going downhill a little bit. Then by the time we get to Sunday, there is rain around. In the morning it should be cloudy. Temperatures about 22 Celsius. For Wimbledon, I suspect a bit of brightness on the way. Now the summary and the outlook. By the time we get to Sunday, there is bits and pieces of rain on the way but on balance not looking so bad. Good evening. There is a set of weather fronts tracking across Northern Ireland and Scotland. The rain is patchy for some now but turning heavy as it moves from Northern Ireland to the heart of Scotland. A blow for the far north of England. In the south we are in the clear. Unlike last night when temperatures dipped close to freezing, it will be mild tonight. Sunshine from the word go in southern and central parts of the UK. A damp start in the north but improving as it will do for parts of Northern Ireland. The best of the sunshine is in the south. A lovely day to come for Wimbledon. A full day’s play. Warmer than today, up to the mid-20s. And for the Ashes at Cardiff, a small risk of a late shower as it clouds over. But hardly worthy of a mention. Clouding over in the afternoon, this is 4.00pm. But in the east clear blue skies and sunshine. And 27 Celsius, is possible. A gentle southerly breeze. The sunshine is ",,
158,BBC1 London,8-jul-2015,BBC News at Six,18:00,30 mins,True,"Today at Six, we’re at Westminster, where the Chancellor has unveiled the most radical Budget of recent years. In the first all-Conservative Budget for nearly 20 years, George Osborne said he was cutting taxes for many and helping the low paid with a new national living wage. But there’ll be a freeze in working-age benefits for four years, including tax credits and housing allowance. All part of a one-nation Budget, according to the Chancellor. A plan for working people. One purpose, one policy, one nation. He talks one nation, but many of the measures announced today will make this country more divided. We’ll be asking people in Bournemouth for their reaction to the Budget, and measuring the impact on workers and families. Also on the programme tonight. The chief executive of Barclays is fired afterjust three years, as the bank seeks a new leader to speed up the pace of change. Chaos for commuters, as London Underground and First Great Western train workers go on strike. England’s joe Root comes to the rescue with a century on the first day of the first Ashes Test in Cardiff. Tonight on BBC London: Half an hour to go until the biggest tube strike in more than a decade brings the underground to standstill. And, the race to get home - thousands of Londoners leave work early to beat the strike. Good evening from Westminster, where the Chancellor has unveiled the most radical Budget in recent years, involving major tax and spending changes. And it represents a notable easing of the timetable for spending cuts announced just a few months ago. Among the measures the Chancellor announced a new compulsory national living wage, to be introduced next year, rising to £9 an hour by 2020, affecting 6 million workers. Many will also benefit from lower taxes, thanks to an increase in the minimum tax threshold and the entry point for the 40p rate. But working-age benefits will be frozen for four years, student grants will be scrapped, and housing benefit for under-21s will also disappear. Overall, this Budget raises the amount of tax the Government collects and sets out much higher public spending for the years ahead. Our deputy political editor, james Landale, has the details. In wasa In was a budgel more radical than any George Osborne had held up for the cameras before. The first truly Tory budget in almost 20 years he hopes will transform the welfare state and fix the deficit for good. A big ambitious budget he promised, that would create a country with higher wage, that would create a country with higherwage, lowertaxes that would create a country with higher wage, lower taxes and less welfare. This is the new settlement, from a one nation Government. This is a one nation budget. It takes the necessary steps and follows a sensible path for the benefit of the whole of the United Kingdom. This is a Conservative budget that can only be delivered because the British people trusted us to finish the job. And that of course meant fixing the deficit. But in the first of many surprises the Chancellor said rising tax revenues meant he could spread the pain of spending cuts over more years than promised. He laying his planned for a surplus until 2019. We should cut it at the same rate at the last Parliament. We shouldn’t go faster or slower. That wasn’t the only announcement Britain deserves a PGY only announcement Britain deserves a pay rise and Britain is getting a PGY pay rise and Britain is getting a pay rise. I am today, introducing a new National Living Wage. The welfare secretary could hardly contain himself. The new so-called National Living Wage will start in April, at 7.20 an hour, before rising to £9 at the end of the Parliament. A new burden for businesses, that the Chancellor said he would off set by cutting corporation tax, to 18%, by 2020 and cutting national insurance for small First Ladies Let me be clear what it mean, 2.5 million people will get a direct pay rise, those currently on the National Living Wage will see their pay rise by over a third of this Parliament, a cash increase for a full-time worker over over 5,000. Budgets are rarely good news and this was no exception ful The Chancellor had cuts to announce. £12 billion of them. The benefit system should not support lifestyles and rents that are not available to the taxpayer’s who pay for their system. So he promised to limit Child Tax Credits tojust two So he promised to limit Child Tax Credits to just two children after April 2017, there will be a freeze for most working age benefits for four years and the income thresh old at which tax credits will fall. And for those who say they are not able to work due to illness, they will lose up to £30 a week in their employment and support allowance or sickness benefit. A long list of substantial welfare cuts that already provoke demonstrations outside Downing Street. As probably will this announcement. In 2016/17 we will replace maintenance grants with loans for new students that only have to be paid back when they earn over 21,000 a year. There was big tax rises and cuts. There will be a rise in insurance premium tax from November, there will be a new car tax for vehicles bought new from 2017. And pension tax relief will be cut for people earn morgue than 150,00 pounds. But, the personal tax free allowance will rise to 11,00 pounds next year, the rate at which the 1+0 pence higher rate is paid will rise and the threshold at which inheritance tax is paid on family homes will rise to £1 million. Annal the and the reason the Defence Secretary was looking so happy the Chancellor promised to spend 2% on knacks income on defence for the last decade. A plan for the nation. All in all Tory MPs were delighted, their opponents less so. How could they oppose a budget that included so many of their own policies? Even with the higher National Living Wage, that he has announced, it will not be enough for a family to live on, because of the cuts in tax credits. That is the... The Chancellor, she said was more ambitious for himself and that the country This Government is playing politics with this budget. This budget is less about economic strategy, more about political tactic, designed by the Chancellor, to help him move next door. But the national parties had no time for the budget cuts. 12 billion worth of cuts, in terms of welfare budget, hitting the poorest in society. That will have a significant impact in Wales, when we estimate round half a billion will be lost to the Welsh economy. It was a bad budget. That is about 50 billion in total over the next five years out of the welfare system. That is really going to hit those at the bottom. Particularly the changes to tax credits. This afternoon the Chancellor got the headlines he wanted. But his aim at this budget was more long-term, to set a political and economic agenda that will last for the next five years. To a time when perhaps he walks through Number Ten not as Chancellor, but as Prime Minister. Well, the Chancellor’s plans to freeze benefits and cut billions from tax credits and other welfare payments will affect millions of people. But he said that decisions about the changes had been ""fair and balanced"", and that the whole benefits system needed to be on ""a more sustainable level"". Our correspondent Michael Buchanan has been looking at the likely winners and losers from today’s budget. The end of a good day for Alex, the butcher at the market hasjust The end of a good day for Alex, the butcher at the market has just got a PGY butcher at the market has just got a pay rise, thanks to George Osborne. The new National Living Wage will put extra money in his pocket. Get maybe a new car, have a holiday, something like that. Also it gives you a better workestic, more money, you don’t get disle losinged with work, it overall puts a positive spin on things. The National Living Wage is currently 6.50 an hour for people aged over 21. 21. It is due to go up to 6.0 in October. But in Prince William it will be 7.20 an hour for people aged over 25. Anti-poverty campaigners urged a rate of closer to £8 an hour. Valerie is trying to build a future for her young family. The single mother works part-time, but needs tax credits to make ends meet. Today’s changes means she is about £120 a month worse off. I could make mY £120 a month worse off. I could make my ends meet and I was getting by with the benefits currently, as they are until now. Now it is being cut back, I am faced with harder choices. My quality of life is being slowly eroded. The tax credit changes will save over £5 billion. The rate at which they are paid will be frozen for four years. There will be limited to two children for new claimants from April 2017 your income will have to be lower to get them. This budget represents a philosophical change by the Government, an end to what the Prime Minister called the welfare merry-go-round of employers paying low wages that have to be topped up with state hand outs. The hand ups have been cut. The minimum wage will be inned. What will happen to the overall income of benefit recipients and how will employers react? Companies will be encouraged to hire more people and pay them more, through cuts to corporation tax and national insurance levels. Business groups are wary of the changes. We will see a Living Wage of £9 and hour, that means it will rise by over 6% a yore, at a tile when inflation is close to zero. What happens if there is an economic shock? Something happens in Greece? It feels like a gamble. It will have a big impact on small firms. The budget will cut the amount paid to most people of working age, who are on benefits. The Government hopes they will react by finding a job or working more hours. Well, among the other changes announced by the Chancellor were an increase in the inheritance tax threshold to £1 million, phased in from 2017. Public sector pay to rise by 1% for the next four years. Defence spending at 2% of GDP every year, meeting a Nato spending target. And a further £8 billion for the NHS by 2020. Our business correspondent Andrew Verity has been looking at the economic impact of Mr Osborne’s plans. It was the first bun from majority Conservative Government for nearly two decades. And as expected it made deep cuts in welfare spending but there were unexpected shades of red, not only raising wages for the low paid but also taxes as a whole. At the budget before the election the plan was to cut the deficit rapidly so you get into a small surplus by the financial year 2018/19, now, the Chancellor will go slower on the spending cut, so we won’t get into the black until a year later. Look at the changes in real spending from year-to-year and you can see we have moved from a very big cut, followed by a sharp rebound, to more modest ups and downs from year-to-year. So much less like a roller-coaster, but still a bit of a bumpy ride. Here is how he is cutting 12 billion a year from the welfare budget. The biggest cuts are 5.1+ billion by cutting thement a of tax credits you get if you earn more than 3800 and 3.9 billion by freezing all benefits for people of working age, so they don’t rise for four years. There are significant cuts here for people dependent on benefits. Once again one of the biggest cuts is freezing a lot of benefits for the next, for the rest of this Parliament. That won’t get much attention, I don’t expect. But that was pretty much the biggest of the changes that we saw on top of big cuts to tax credits and Universal Credit. So a significant effect on people dependent on benefits. The budget looks like it is offering tax cuts by raising the personal allowance and cutting corporation tax, but that is more than made up for by tax rises from insurance premium tax to scrapping tax credits on share dividends. Ita net tax rise over the next five years of 5.8 billion. Outside the Treasury today, this no longer looks like the toughest austerity since the war. But those targeted for welfare cuts and tax rises won’t like being in the Chancellor’s sights. The Budget will, of course, have a big impact on business. A new 8% surcharge on bank profits will be introduced, and the bank levy rate gradually reduced. Permanent non-dom status is to be abolished. That means anyone who has lived in the UK for 15 of the past 20 years will pay same level of tax as other UK citizens. There’ll be various measures to clamp down on tax avoidance and tax evasion. And dividend tax credit is to be replaced with a new tax-free allowance. 8I’II’IOUI’ICâI’|'IâI’Il announcement today across the board. How big was the announcement for you? The Chancellor called it a big Budget, saying it had big ambitions. It seemed to me there were big personal and political ambitions. George Osborne talked of calling for a new settlement, which is code for saying I want to rewrite the rules of the game to suit my own side. He did something surprising. He announced spending and welfare cuts which were a bit slower and a bit softer than the ones he had pledged before the election. Normally it is the other way round, you want to hide how tough you are going to be. He was tough before and rather less so afterwards. He raided Labour’s manifesto for their most popular policies. I’ll have an increase in the minimum wage, a levy on firms to PGY the minimum wage, a levy on firms to pay for apprentices,ly crack down on the so-called non-domes who pay less tax than many think they should. And announced Tory tax rises. The tax rises rather less visible when you buy insurance, when you contribute to your pension, and other things, are bigger than any tax cuts they are making. And those benefit cuts may be just a bit slower than we were expecting. They will still be eye watering for many families and will dwarf the increase in your pay. A big yes, but is it a big game changer or do you think it is a big scandal? That’s the judgment for voters. Nick, thank you. The welfare changes are controversial. There’s a protest in Parliament Square right now against some of those welfare cuts. You may be able to hear some of the chanting going on. And you can find lots more detail on the budget and how it affects you on the BBC website. just go to bbc.co.uk/news and follow the links. In the meantime, back to Sophie. Our top story. The first all-Conservative Budget in nearly 20 years, the Chancellor introduces new compulsory national living wage and freezes working age benefits. Coming UP freezes working age benefits. Coming up we’ll be at Paddington as Later on BBC London: As the capital braces itself for the biggest tube strike since 2002, we’ll have the latest and hear from both sides in the dispute. And what will the budget-macro mean for London. Barclays Bank has fired its chief executive, Anthonyjenkins, after less than three years in charge. It’s understood that the board thought the pace of cost-cutting was too slow, and that the bank’s investment arm wasn’t performing well enough. Mrjenkins is being replaced - temporarily - by the new chairman, john McFarlane. He was known not always kindly as St Anthony. The man Barclays promoted to the topjob Anthony. The man Barclays promoted to the top job as it struggled to clean up its aggressive cuff after the financial crisis. It seems his job is done this. Morning he was sacked. The bank’s chairman told me Mrjenkins was not the man to reramp the bank. Anthony did an awful lot right. You can see this bank is in much better shape than when he inherited, but is question is, is he the right guy to go forward with a different agenda? After multimillion pound fines for manipulating interest rates and rows over power Mrjenkins said there was a need for a different kind of bank. I think we were too aggressive, too short-term focused and on occasion too self serving. With Mrjenkins out of the picture, Barclays was warned it shouldn’t return to the mistakes of the past. The worry with his departure and why alarm bells will be ringing is that some might conclude this shows a wavering commitment to bringing about the culture change we need to see in Barclays and other banks. Mrjenkins will receive a pay-off of £2 million. He left after the bank’s share price lagged behind competitors. Like many banks, Barclays has been struggling to find new ways to make money since the financial crisis. Now it looks like the new chairman wants to speed up reform and cut costs at a bank he described to me as cumbersome. Barclays has already announced plans to close 90 branches by the end of the year. Could there be more to come? People are not using branches as much as we used to and we’ve got to recognise it will be part of the equake, but not the major theme. Barclays’ share price rose 2% today as the markets reflected on plans to make that bank more efficient. Eflected on plans to make that bank more efficient. The challenge - making healthier profits without Barclays being in the headlines for all the wrong reasons. Greece has formally asked for a three-year rescue package from the Eurozone’s special support fund, the European Stability Mechanism. There were boos and cheers at the European parliament in Strasbourg today when the country’s Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras appeared before MEPs. He told them Greece would offer credible economic reform plans by tomorrow, to try to solve the country’s debt crisis. MPs will be asked to vote on changes to existing laws on fox hunting in England and Wales as early as next week. They will reportedly be given a free vote on whether to bring England and Wales into line with Scotland, where hunts can use an unlimited number of dogs to flush out foxes. 20,000 London Underground workers are beginning a 21+-hour strike this evening - the biggest for a decade. Millions of commuters will be affected. The walk-out coincides with a two day strike by First Great Western staff, which will disrupt services between London, Wales and the West Country. Our transport correspondent, Richard Westcott, is at Paddington Station. Sophie, you can probably see a few stragglers going in and out but they are leaving it a bit late. We’ve got two unrelated rail strikes. Both of them starting at 6.30pm. The whole Underground is going to shut down, all 270 stations are going to be closed from tonight and through tomorrow and are back open on Friday morning. That’s a dispute over some new all-night services they are bringing in on five lines in September. There’s a union protest over there you can probably hear. There is another strike on First Great Western trains, unrelated but it is starting tonight. That I’m told will be OK for the London commuters coming in here to Paddington, but the services going from here down to the South West, down to Cornwall, to Bristol, to South Wales and so on will be affected. I’m hearing that only half of those are running. Very busy trains. The Tube dispute is vitriolic between the two sides. That’s looking nasty, not boding well for the future. Bad news for Londoners in the days and weeks ahead. Richard, thank you. Andy Murray is through to the semi finals at Wimbledon. In a Centre Court match twice delayed by rain he beat Canada’s Vasek Pospisil in straight sets. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were among those cheering him on. Murray will now meet Roger Federer in the semi final on Friday. Crickets now. A sedgery from batsman joe Root rescued England on the first day of the ashes in Cardiff. Australia had taken three early English wickets before Root’s magnificent 131+ steered England to a strong position. A short while ago England were 319-6. It is only the cursed Australians who get a red carpet for a Test match. That’s the love it has relationship which reignites the Ashes every time. Here after lies went for 6, Cook fell gently, caught for 20. When Ian Bell was lbw for one England were 1+3 for 3 and joe Root was out for a duck, if the ball had stuck at the glove. Brad had season an Aussie national treasure. This mistake was expensive. Root didn’t look bad. Slings and arrows of fortune passing by. The captain could only watch but between lunch and tea, not a single English wicket nor a Welsh rain drop fell. joe Root completed the fastest ever century on the first day of an Ashes series. Too early to get carried away? Well, Australia did hold a catch to get rid of Root, 131+ runs later than they would have liked. Back to our main story of the day, the Budget. Huw is in Westminster. Sophie, thank you. Welcome back to Westminster, where the Chancellor has unveiled really what is the most radical Budget in recent years, involving major changes in tax and spending. There’ll be a new compulsory national living wage to be introduced next year. Many will benefit from lower taxes thanks to an increase in the minimum thresh tax hold, threshold and the entry point for the 30p rate. Working blefrts be frozen for four years. Reeta Chakrabarti has been speaking to people in Bournemouth. After days of sunshine, a cool breeze in Bournemouth, reflecting the mixed fortunes of holiday- makers in Bournemouth, reflecting the mixed fortunes of holiday-makers in George Osborne’s Budget. Summer is all about sea, sand and sticks of rock. We’ve got our own to test out what people thought of the Budget. We’ve got budget winners and losers. Losers. Let’s see which people pick. These sixth formers decided they were losers. Their living cost grant will be scrapped next year and they’ll have to borrow the money instead. It is completely ridiculous to be honest. University students should be subsidised by the Government. It is to do with our future and our country’s future. The Chancellor’s throwing that away almost. He says country can’t afford it and it is right to somebody like you, who will go on the earn more because of your degree, that you should pay more at the beginning. I don’t agree with that at all. I think the current Government is reducing taxes for rich people and just throwing it all on poor people, we should be taxing them heavier and subsidising the people’s future. It is making they think, should I really go to university, should I seek other employment instead? It is such a massive burden. But winners include pensioners. They keep benefits like free TV licences, and the inheritance threshold rises to £1 million for married couples in two years’ time. Anything that contributes to a longer pension and where your money goes that little bit further has got to be good. From the point of view of the inheritance tax, things like that, I think it is a very good thing. Less of a good thing for those out of work whose benefits will be cut, and welfare claimants out of London face a cap that’s lower than in the capital. But middle earners see two tax thresholds rise and that’s good news. I do thresholds rise and that’s good news. Ido think it’s going to help. Hopefully if we plan to have another one at any stage we should be OK. A Budget is a fine balancing act. George Osborne will hope for feel themselves winners than losers today. The view in Bournemouth. Back here at Westminster Robert Peston is with me. When we were discussing the last budget four months ago, a very different picture, so what is your reading of this? This is the first purely Tory Budget since 1996. But it’s not what most people would think of as a conventional Tory Budget. Can you think of the Conservative Party of Margaret Thatcher ordering the biggest rise in well, what we used to call the minimum wage, they are now asking us to call the living wage, in a generation, forcing companies to pay their lowest-paid people more. Intervening in the market in this very significant way. This is not the Tory Party of Margaret Thatcher. It is a Tory Party that wants to shrink the state, but actually the cuts that they’ve announced much less severe than they said in March. When they had Lib Dems who were supposed to be reining in this kind of stuff, so the cuts in public service spending, less than £20 billion or so by the end of the Parliament, compared to well over £1+0 billion on the original plans. This is not going to be a painless Budget for millions of people, but again, if you look at the welfare reductions, many of those will hurt people on middling income tax, some of, on middling incomes, some of whom you might think were traditional Tory supporters. The ideas of shrink the benefits, shrink the state, reward work more, these are classic Tory values but they are approaching then in a very different way from the Tory Party of the past. Robert, thank you. Sunny but not that warm. Cast your mind back to last Wednesday. The dizzy heights of 36 degrees. We’ve had a bit of deflation over the last week or so. So. 19 today if you were lucky. Heavy showers across parts of north-east England through this evening, and the odd shower continuing into the night. For most of us the story is clearing skies. The winds falling light. The technologies dropping like a stone. Even in towns and cities down the single figures in rural areas of the north. By dawn not far off freezing. By the time most of us are up, temperatures will have bounced up. There’ll be lighter winds, fewer showers, more sunshine. It will feel more like it. Wimbledon should should see a full day’s play. And for the Ashes at Cardiff the cloud will break up and the sun will come through. At 1+ o’clock we are set fair across the heart of England and Wales. There’ll be some patches of cloud around but it won’t spoil things. Temperatures doing OK. High teens, low 20s. The winds will be lighter. Fine up the spine of northern England, into Scotland. Showers across the far north will tend to fade away. It will cloud over across Northern Ireland. It will turn wet overnight and rain on Friday across Scotland and Northern Ireland, it will come and go. There’ll be drier spells is, but with blustery winds. Further south, increasing sunshine. 15 or 16, 26, possibly 27 in the sunshine in the South East on Friday. Still some warm sunshine to come here on Saturday but blustery showers further north and west. Sunday not looking all that pretty, with rain. ",,

George Osborne offers a blend of tax cuts and tax rises and says the low paid will benefit from a national living wage. But working-age benefits will be frozen for four years, including tax credits and housing allowance - all part of what the chancellor called a one-nation budget. A plan for working people - one purpose, one policy, one nation. He talks one nation, but many of the measures announced today will make this country more divided. We’ll be asking people in Bournemouth for their reaction, and measuring the Budget impact on workers and families.

And how American football is to be played at Tottenham’s new stadium, due for completion in 2018. Good evening. The Chancellor has delivered his seventh budget, the most radical of recent years, involving major changes in taxation and spending. It also represents a notable easing of the timetable for spending cuts which he announced just a few months ago. Among the measures, Mr Osborne announced what he called a national living wage to be introduced next year, rising to £9 pounds an hour by 2020, affecting six million workers. Many will also benefit from lower taxes thanks to an increase in the minimum tax threshold and the entry point for the 40p rate. But working-age benefits will be frozen for four years, student maintenance grants will be scrapped and housing benefit for under-21s will also disappear. Overall, taxes will rise by almost £50 billion in the years ahead, as Nick Robinson explains. A big Budget with big ambitions is what he said it would be. He was not kidding. What George Osborne tried to do was to rewrite the rules of politics, to define a new centre ground and claimed that he and his party now occupy it. George Osborne, the Chancellor of the Exchequer! A Budget that sets out a plan for Britain for the next five years to keep moving us from a low wage, high tax, high wealth they economy, to the higher wage, lower tax, tax, high wealth they economy, to the higherwage, lowertax, lower welfare country we intend to create. This is the new settlement. A new settlement but had a chancellery from -- A new settlement but had a chancellery from -- a Chancellor from a party that once fought the minimum wage or drink businesses to increase the pay of their workers. I am introducing a national living wage. The minimum wage is currently £6 50 an hour, the Chancellor is in effect branding it as the national living wage and hiking the rate to 7p 20 from next April. He is setting a target rate of £9 per hour to be reached by 2020. Those currently on the minimum wage will see their pay rise by over a third in this Parliament, a cash increase for a full-time worker of over £5,000. The welfare secretary could scarcely contain himself, shouting fantastic! The benefit system should not support lifestyles and rent is not available to the taxpayers who pay for that system. That claim had to be repeated three times after it was interrupted by the sound of booing. It is tax credits that are cut the most, fewer people will get them and they will be less generous. Future claimants will only be able to claim for two children, however big their family. There will be a freeze on the rate of most working age benefits for the next four years. New claimants for what used to be known as the sick and is now called ESA will find they will only get the same rate as the dole if they are judged to be able to do what is called work-related activity. Student maintenance grants will be cut and replaced by more generous loans. But the welfare cuts are being introduced at a slower rate than pledge before the election, over four years, than pledge before the election, overfouryears, not two. So, than pledge before the election, over four years, not two. So, too, other spending cuts. The Chancellor delayed the date he aims to clear the deficit by another year. We should cut the deficit at the same pace as the last Parliament. We should not go faster or slower. Good news for the Defence Secretary. He can tell the men and women in uniform but their budget will after raw meat the Nato target, 2% of national income. There were big Budget changes to taxes, significant rises dwarfed cuts designed to catch the eye. Income tax thresholds go up again for the basic and higher rate, inheritance tax is cut, so family homes with up to £1 million will be exempt and Corporation Tax will be cut by 2% over the next five years. What about tax rises? Buying in Shearings, whether on homes or holidays will cost more, so we’ll buying many new cars, and pension tax relief for the highest earners will be cut. What the Chancellor called his big Budget ended with a mightily big claim. A plan for working people, one purpose, one policy, one nation. Conservative MPs loved the Osbourne formula, one part traditional Tory policies, one part of ruthless raids on Labour ‘s most popular policies. What on earth would she say? Low blow even with the higher national living wage that he has announced, it will not be enough for a family to live on because of the cuts in tax credits. The Chancellor, Harriet Harman said, with more ambitious for himself than the country. This government macro is playing politics with this Budget. It is less about economic strategy, more about political tactics designed by the Chancellor to help him move next door. Shame on you! Outside, protesters didn’t care whether the cuts were slower than promised or threatened. Austerity goes on, hitting, they believe, the poorest, while leaving the richest unscathed. The opposition parties agree. About £50 billion in total over the next five years out of the welfare system, that will hit those at the bottom, particularly the changes to tax credits. In the coalition years we made sure that we were in it together and the broader shoulders carried the biggest burden. It is noticeable that the tax cuts announced and implied for the future are heavily weighted towards the wealthiest. Of course, George Osborne is not in a coalition any more and is relishing the freedom it has given him. His aim is nothing less than to speed the transformation of written into a country defined by Conservative values -- country defined by Conservative values -- the transformation of Great Britain. The Chancellor’s plans to freeze benefits and cut billions from tax credits and other welfare payments will affect millions of people, both in and out of work. But he claimed that decisions about the changes had been fair and balanced and that the entire benefits system needed to be on a more sustainable level. Our correspondent Michael Buchanan assesses the latest push from welfare to work. The end of a good day for Alex Carey. The butcher at Bury Market hasjust got a pay rise thanks to George Osborne. The new national living wage will put extra money in his pocket. Will get, maybe, new car, have a holiday, something like that. Also it gives you a better work ethic going into work, more motivation, more money. You don’t feel like you get disillusioned with work. So, overall, itjust puts a positive spin on things. There will be no luxuries, however, for Valerie. The single mother works part-time at Bristol University and relies on tax credits to make the numbers stack up. Today’s changes have been upsetting. She’s about £120 a month worse off. I could make my en suite, and I was getting by with the benefits currently, as they were until now. ~ -- I could make ends meet. Now it’s been cut back, I’m faced with hard choices. My quality of life is being slowly, inevitably eroded. Families currently on tax credits are among the biggest losers in the Budget. Today’s changes will also greatly restrict the number of households who will ever be untitled to the benefits. This Budget represents a philosophical change by the government, an end to what the Prime Minister called the welfare merry-go-round of employers paying low wages that have to be topped up with state hand-outs. The hand-outs are being cut, the minimum wage will be increased. The questions now are what will happen to the overall income of benefit recipients, and how will employers react? Companies will be encouraged to hire more people and pay them more through cuts to corporation tax and national insurance levels. Business groups are wary of the changes. We’re going to see a living wage in 2020 of £9 an hour, that means, on average, it’s going to be rising by over 6% per year at a time when inflation is close to zero. And what happens if there’s an economic shock, for example? Something happens in Greece? It feels like a gamble and it will have an impact on firms, in particular, sectors, and on small firms. The Budget will cut the amount paid to most people of working age who are on benefits. The Government hopes they will respond positively either by finding a job or working more hours, but there are no guarantees. Michael Buchanan, BBC News. Let’s list some of the other changes announced by the Chancellor today. Public sector pay rises will be fixed to 1% annually for the next four years. As trailed, there will be an increase in the Inheritance Tax threshold to £1 million. Not expected was the news that defence spending will be fixed at 2% of GDP every year, meeting a key Nato target. And there’s a boost for the NHS, with a further £8 billion by 2020. Our economics editor Robert Peston has been looking in more detail at the Budget numbers. In the last Parliament, George Osborne was supposedly prevented from making really extreme cuts are the imposing figure to the left of him, Danny Alexander of the Lib Dems. But now that the Tories are governing on their own, George Osborne’s austerity turned out to be, well, less extreme than he said it would be in March. Before the election, the Chancellor implied it was almost a matter of life and death that the Government should generate a surplus, spend less than tax revenues by 2018-19. But today, mending the so-called roof while the sun shined seems to have become a bit less of a priority because the deficit had to be eliminated until the very last year of the Parliament and the government is set to borrow £18 billion more during the Parliament than it said it would do in March. As for shrinking the state, slashing public services, that too has become less severe. Cuts to public services are now planned at £18 billion per year. Big, but less than half the EA2 billion of cuts he had been promising or perhaps frightening for 2018-19. ~ -- all perhaps threatening. What’s going on? Look at the changes in real spending from year to year and you can see that we have moved from a very big cut followed by a very sharp rebound to more modest ups and downs from year to year, so much less like a roller-coaster but still a bit bumpy ride. George Osborne’s rhetoric today was all about tax cuts but in fact, tax rises on insurance unions, on dividends paid by companies asked set to raise EA7 billion over the Parliament. ~ -- rises on insurance premiums. Compared with tax cuts ofjust £25 billion. And although the rain on tax credit and housing benefits will take money away from millions of people and families, cut the welfare of more than £12 billion a year are being spread over four years, not the promised two. So George Osborne, on his own, seems less, well, on the right, less move than when he shared his office with the Lib Dems. He is even intervening in markets by ordering companies to PPV in markets by ordering companies to pay workers more. Read George, anyone?! -- Red George. A new 8% surcharge on bank profits will be announced. Anyone who has lived in the UK for 11 of the last 15 years will have to pay the same taxes UK citizens. There will be measures to clamp down on tax evasion and forms of aggressive tax avoidance and new tax breaks on incomes and shares for smaller investors. In a moment we’ll speak to our political editor Nick Robinson, who’s in Downing Street. But first Robert Peston, our economics editor, is here. ~ Iam thinking I am thinking that when we discussed the last Budget a few months ago, the figures were radically different. What has happened? This was billed as a big Budget and the first properly Tory Budget since 96,, won the Conservatives were last governing on their own. I think there is quite a lot to that. For example, although as I mentioned in mY example, although as I mentioned in my piece the austerity and public spending cuts are less extreme than we were told they would be in March, nonetheless, the Chancellor has set out a plan to reduce the national debt by ten percentage points of GDP, taking it down to about 70% of GDP by the end of the parliament. A significant fall, although the debt would still be very high by recent British standards. He is on a path to reduce public spending as a share of national income, GDP, from about 1+0% at the moment, broadly where it has been over the last 20 or 30 years, down to 36%. We have not seen a level of 36% almost at all since the post-war period, the last time was when Gordon Brown went through a reef period of total pass on any in about 1999/2000. reef period of total pass on any in about1999/2000. It about 1999/2000. It is the sort of thing that Margaret Thatcher would approve of. But the other thing he is doing, which is ordering companies to pay their lowest paid people considerably more, that is not the kind of intervention in markets that Margaret Thatcher would like. Infact, this view would be that if she even her George Osborne much ring about that kind of meddling with the private sector, she probably would have hit him with her handbag and told him... Are we putting this in the tradition of the great reforming budgets we have seen in the past? No doubt George Osborne aspires to that committee wants this to be seen as a budget like Geoffrey Howe under Margaret Thatcher in 1981 or Nigel Lawson in 1988, big, reforming addicts. There were two big political surprises at the heart, the first that he did something that politicians almost never do. -- reforming budgets. We expect them to tell us good news before an election and after the election say that it is worse. He turned it on its head. Therefore the election he said these heavy cuts would have been made but after it he said, not quite so many cuts and done rather slower. Another surprise, the ruthless raid on Labour’s manifesto, whether the promise of an increased minimum wage, called the living wage now, whether it was that tax punishment for the so-called non-doms, or a levy on businesses to make them pay for a priggish. levy on businesses to make them pay fora priggish. He was levy on businesses to make them pay for a priggish. He was looking at the most popular policies of Ed Miliband and saying, I’ll have those thank you. He knows these welfare cuts, slower than originally planned, will still be controversial. He has tried to make sure he is not taking cash from too many people so a big budget but what adjective you put afterwards, big game changer or big scandal, that’s UP game changer or big scandal, that’s up to you. Thank you. And you can find lots more detail on the Budget and how it affects you on the BBC website. just go to bbc.co.uk/news and follow the links. There are blogs from Nick and Robert and our other correspondence. Now to the other news. Barclays Bank has sacked its chief executive, Anthonyjenkins, who was appointed less than three years ago. It’s understood that the board of directors wanted a faster pace of cost-cutting and better performance by the bank’s investment arm. Mrjenkins is being replaced temporarily by the new chairman john McFarlane, as our business editor Kamal Ahmed reports. He was known, not always kindly, as Saint Anthony, the man Barclays promoted to the top job as it struggled to clean up its aggressive culture after the financial crisis. It seems hisjob is done. This morning he was sacked. The bank’s chairman told me Mrjenkins was not the man to revamp the bank. Anthony did an awful lot right. You can see this bank is in much better shape than it was when he inherited it. The question is, is he the right guy to go forward with a different agenda? After multi-million pound fines for manipulating interest rates and rows over pay, Mrjenkins was the man who said there was a need for a different kind of bank. I think we were too aggressive, I think we were to short-term focused, and I think, on occasion, we were too self-serving. With Mrjenkins now out of the picture, Barclays was warned it should not return to the mistakes the past. Mrjenkins followed this man, Bob Diamond, who saw rapid growth of the bank and plenty of controversy. Barclays was warned not to repeat the mistakes of the past now Mr jenkins has gone. The worry with his departure and why alarm bells will be ringing is that some might conclude that this shows a wavering commitment to bringing about the culture change we need to see in Barclays and other banks. Mrjenkins will receive a payoff of £2 million. He left after the bank’s share price lagged behind competitors. Like many banks, Barclays has been struggling to find new ways to make money since the financial crisis. Now it looks like the new chairman wants to speed up reform and cut costs at a bank he described to me as cumbersome. Barclays has already announced plans to close 90 branches by the end of the year. Could there be more to come? People are not using branches as much as they used to before and therefore we have just got to recognise that that will be part of the equation but it is not the major theme. Barclays’ share price rose 2% today as the markets reflected on plans to make the bank more efficient. The challenge now, making healthier profits without Barclays rediscovering its knack of making headlines for all the wrong reasons. Kamal Ahmed, BBC News. Twenty thousand London Underground workers have started a 21+-hour strike this evening, the biggest action for a decade. Commuters faced disruption - there were queues outside some tube stations before the strike started. The walkout coincides with a strike by First Great Western staff which will disrupt services between London, Wales and the West Country. Our transport correspondent Richard Westcott is at Paddington Station. Bring us up-to-date on the impact of this and is there any resolution to this insight? That sums it up, the locked gate, the entire London Underground network is shut town tonight and it will be for all of tomorrow, act in action on Friday morning. That is in a dispute overnight services that are coming in. There is another unconnected dispute that also started the night, the service is going from Paddington Station to the South West and South Wales. They will be if elected for the next two days so only around half of those trains are running, a double whammy for commuters. You asked about the talks, from what I hear about thejupiter asked about the talks, from what I hear about the jupiter talks, there is a new negotiating team at London Underground and I have not been eating on with the unions -- about the Tube talks. They have not been getting on with the unions. The prime minister of Greece, Alexis Tsipras, has to produce what he calls ‘credible’ reform proposals by tomorrow. That’s the final deadline set by European leaders if a new bailout package is to be agreed, saving Greece from economic collapse. Banks in Greece are to remain closed until Monday. Our chief correspondent Gavin Hewitt reports from Athens. This is a country facing an ultimatum - accept reforms in exchange for funding or face exit from the euro. It is also a country slowly unravelling. Visit a meat store. Greece imports large amounts of its meat but its suppliers are now demanding cash that is fast running out. TRANSLATION: Since the banks closed down, no foreign supplier is willing to tell us meat unless we pay cash advance. ~ -- sell us We will be out of meat in ten days’ time. meet. Go to the supermarket. There is no panic buying here but customers are stocking up. We are experiencing dramatic differences in demand in certain products like pasta, rice, baby products, baby food. The Greek government felt it necessary today to reassure people there were adequate food supplies. In the cafes, they watched the Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, take his case to the European Parliament. There was some booing as he called for a fair deal for Greece. TRANSLATION: We are fighting for an agreement. We want an agreement that means a viable way out of the crisis, that lets us see the light at the end of the tunnel. In Greece, there were long queues at the ATM machines again. Banks are likely to remain closed until the end of the week. Greece has submitted a request for a three-year loan and tomorrow has to deliver detailed reform proposals. With just a few days left until the deadline, Alexis Tsipras will still have to sell painful reforms to the Greek people. What he hopes for in return from Europe’s leaders is a commitment to at least discuss debt relief some time in the future. France described Greece’s latest proposals as balanced and positive. Other countries remain much more cautious. Gavin Hewitt, BBC News, Athens. The Chinese stock markets have continued to fall despite official efforts to stem the huge losses of recent weeks. Shares listed in Shanghai and Hong Kong have fallen in value by a third in less than a month, wiping nearly £2 trillion off company values. The losses are affecting tens of millions of people, as our China editor Carrie Gracie explains. This does contain some flashing images. On the Shanghai stock exchange, green is the colour of despair, a bubble bursting. Nearly half the companies listed have now suspended trading altogether to stop their share price falling further. Whatever the board says, this is no longer a working market. The crash will come, the question is when, and if the crash comes later with a bigger bubble, the crash can be totally devastating. The fear now is whether or not it becomes a systemic crisis in the financial system. So this is now a full-scale emergency. The government is forcing big players to hold onto shares and even to buy, declaring a stock market rally a patriotic duty. But patriotism is at war with the survival instinct and the market is still plunging. The victims. Four out of five investors are ordinary people like button seller Lin. In May, as stocks were soaring, she followed the herd into the market, gambling her life savings of £20,000. Now her shares have halved in value but she wants to believe the politicians can turn this disaster around. TRANSLATION: Of course, it’s very painful but there’s nothing I can do. We are still hoping the government will be able to do something to help. Government-controlled TV news finally mentioned the stock market problem, without admitting that the rescue is failing. Their top story was President Xi jinping at a regional summit in Russia. But that facade of normality will become harder to maintain if damage spreads to the rest of the world’s second-largest economy. China could make the problems of Greece feel small by comparison.

On day one of the first Ashes Test in Cardiff batsman joe Root scored a century as England recovered from a poor start against Australia. Our correspondent joe Wilson reports. It’s only the cursed Australians who get a red carpet for a Test match - that’s the love-hate relationship which reignites the Ashes every time. England were in a mess on the first morning. When Ian Bell felt LBW they were 1+3-3 and joe Root was out for a duck, if the ball had stuck in the glove. At 37 years old, Brad Haddin knows a mistake when he makes one. Root did not look back. Australia charged in, Root made runs. Slings and arrows of fortune just passed him by. Look in the scorebook, it is four. joe Root completed the fastest ever century on the first day of an Ashes series, 131+ his final score. England had reached 31+3-7 at the close and the crowd had also seen half centuries from Gary Ballance and Ben Stokes before he was expertly dismissed by Mitchell Starc. The bowler chose the silent celebration. England won’t mind shouting the score. joe Wilson, BBC News, Cardiff. More now on today’s main story, the budget, widely regarded as the most radical of recent years, involving a major shift in taxation and spending. It brings in a new, compulsory national living wage. Many will benefit from lower taxes but working-age benefits will be frozen for four years. Reeta Chakrabarti has been asking people in Bournemouth for their views on Mr Osborne’s plans. After days of sunshine, a cool breeze in Bournemouth, reflecting the mixed fortunes of holiday makers in George Osborne’s budget. Summer is, of course, all about sea, sand and sticks of rock and we’ve got our own to test out what people thought of the budget. We’ve got budget winners and budget losers. Let’s see which ones people pick. These sixth formers all decided they were losers. Their living cost grant will be scrapped next year and they will have to borrow the money instead. I think it’s completely ridiculous to be honest, universities should be subsidised by the government. It is to do with our future and our country’s future that the Chancellor is throwing away almost. He says the country can’t afford it and it’s right that someone like you, who will go on to earn more because of your degree, it’s right that you should pay more at the beginning. I don’t agree with that at all. The current government is reducing taxes for rich people and just throwing it all on poor people. We should be taxing them heavier and subsidising the country’s future. But winners include pensioners. They keep benefits like free TV licences, and the inheritance tax threshold rises to £1 million for married couples in two years’ time. Anything that contributes to a longer pension and where your money goes that little bit further has got to be good. I suppose from a point of view... The inheritance tax, things like that, yeah, I think it’s a very good thing. Less of a good thing for those out of work whose benefits will be cut and welfare claimants out of London face a cap that is lower than in the capital but middle earners see two tax thresholds rise and that is good news. Ido think it’s going to help and hopefully, if we plan to have another one at any stage, we should be OK. The budget is a fine balancing act. George Osborne will hope more feel themselves winners losers today. Reeta Chakrabarti, BBC News, Bournemouth. Some views on the budget in Bournemouth.

The tube network across the capital has completely shut down tonight - impact of a 21+-hour strike by workers which began at 6pm this evening. Thousands of commuters left work early ahead of the walk-out - which will mean no tube services tomorrow. Mayor Boris johnson said the strike was totally unnecessary and politically motivated. But Unions say plans for an all-night tube are being rushed through. Our transport correspondent Tom Edwards is at Warren Street station now. So does it seem that most people planned for the strike? ~ I think most commuters headed the warnings and headed home early. There was an early rush hour. At about 8pm, the tube station started to shut down, and this is only the beginning. By late evening, the tube had shut down. Many commuters headed home early to avoid missing the last trains. I usually work until half past seven, so I’ve had to leave early. It’s a pain that everyone’s going to get stuck but, you know, they’re fighting for their rights, so I suppose it makes sense. I would suggest go from Wimbledon after Clapham junction... At Wimbledon, TfL staff were helping tennis fans plan theirjourney home. The gentleman that has just helped us out, so we’re going to go to Waterloo and they get the bus up to Liverpool Street. We’ll leave early, get the tube home early. Is it going to cut your day short? Yeah, it will, but it’s understandable. If the guys have got to go on strike for what they believe in, fairenough. We’ve got to get back to Hertfordshire later on, so I’m a bit worried about that. But I’m hoping my husband’s going to come and rescue me. Across London, and early rush-hour. This was Canary Wharf at 1+:30pm. This was Oxford Circus. ",,

The tube network across the capital has completely shut down tonight - impact of a 2li-hour strike by workers which began at 6pm this evening. Thousands of commuters left work early ahead of the walk-out - which will mean no tube services tomorrow. Mayor Boris johnson said the strike was totally unnecessary and politically motivated. But Unions say plans for an all-night tube are being rushed through. Our transport correspondent Tom Edwards is at Warren Street station now. So does it seem that most people planned for the strike? ~ I think most commuters headed the warnings and headed home early. There was an early rush hour. At about 8pm, the tube station started to shut down, and this is only the beginning. By late evening, the tube had shut down. Many commuters headed home early to avoid missing the last trains. I usually work until half past seven, so I’ve had to leave early. It’s a pain that everyone’s going to get stuck but, you know, they’re fighting for their rights, so I suppose it makes sense. I would suggest go from Wimbledon after Clapham junction... At Wimbledon, TfL staff were helping tennis fans plan theirjourney home. The gentleman that has just helped us out, so we’re going to go to Waterloo and they get the bus up to Liverpool Street. We’ll leave early, get the tube home early. Is it going to cut your day short? Yeah, it will, but it’s understandable. If the guys have got to go on strike for what they believe in, fairenough. We’ve got to get back to Hertfordshire later on, so I’m a bit worried about that. But I’m hoping my husband’s going to come and rescue me. Across London, and early rush-hour. This was Canary Wharf at 4:30pm. This was Oxford Circus. It had to be shut to prevent overcrowding. And bike hire stands empty early at Warren Street. And businesses say the tube strike isn’t good news. The tube strike is a realfrustration for a small business in London. Normally we have 23 people in the office, tomorrow we’re probably going to have about eight people, a skeleton staff. This dispute is about the introduction of the night tube. It’s meant to boost the night-time economy. Four unions have walked out. That hasn’t happened since 2002. They say they are being railroaded in two new working conditions. The real question should be put back to the mayor and the management, why art they driving the tube over the edge of the cliff like this? It’s totally unnecessary. They should just put a delay on the whole project, get back to the drawing board, come back to us and say, how can we work together to deliver night tube? Because, at the moment, their workforce are speaking with theirfeet, and enough is enough. There is, though, a pay deal on the table. A 2% rise for all workers and a £500 bonus for station staff affected, and £2000 for drivers on the night tube lines. The mayor says the unions should put it to their members. The timing of this strike, on the day of the first Conservative Budget for 18 years, or however long it is, is plainly intended to, you know, make a point. That’s what they want to do. And I’m talking about the union leadership now, not the members. And that’s why they’re not putting this offer back to the membership in the way that they should. These services, these 2lI-hour services, are good for London, they’re good for Londoners. Other cities have them, New York, Berlin, Sydney, Chicago, Paris is looking at them now. These are the norm now, and it’s about time we had them here in London. So the unions and LU need to get back round the table and to the deal. There’s a deal to be done. Transport bosses have admitted the night tube could be delayed. It was meant to start in September. And tomorrow commuters can expect queues, crowding and delays. So, Tom, more of the same tomorrow? Yeah, and I think that is the crucial thing to remember, and it is worth repeating. There will be no tube at all tomorrow right across the capital. Transport for London are saying they are putting on extra buses, extra river services and National rail will run pretty much as normal, but that will be very, very busy, as are the roads. London Underground are now warning the disruption could carry on rate until Friday. From Warren Street, thank you, Tom Edwards. And we’ll have the latest information to try and help you get round the capital tomorrow with travel updates every 15 minutes on our radio station BBC London 94.9, and on the live page of our website at the usual address. A talented footballer from Ilford has died after collapsing during a pre-season friendly with the Kent side he was hoping tojoin. 2lI-year-old junior Dian collapsed suddenly during a trial match for Tonbridge Angels as they played in Surrey last night. Attempts to revive him on the pitch were unsuccessful, and he was pronounced dead at St George’s in Tooting this morning. ~ I can’t comprehend what happened. Watching the two physios working on him to keep him going, and then the medical staff from the ambulance crew, it is something I will never, ever see again in my life. A police officer is to be prosecuted for perjury following the inquest into the death of a man in south London with mental health problems in 2008.

Mr Rigg’s family appealed to the CPS over the original decision not to prosecute him. Football club Tottenham Hotspur have announced that two American football games will be played at their new stadium every year as part of a ten-year deal with the NFL.

The sport’s increased in popularity in London since matches were first played at Wembley in 2007. Time for me to say goodnight and hand you over to Tomasz Schafernaker It is getting warmer? The temperature is rising. Sunshine on the way. Tomorrow should be a stunning, beautiful day across the capital. Clear blue skies, sparkling sunshine, just a nice, sunny day on the way. We have got clear skies tonight, it will get quite chilly, 8 degrees in high Wycombe. So the early birds will be shivering, but the sun will be out in temperatures will not be sky-high, maybe no more than 23 degrees and maybe only in the teens in some places, but thanks to southerly winds from France, we get warm air coming in and it will be a lovely day. So thanks to those winds from the South, temperatures will rise maybe even up to 27 degrees in London on Friday. If you have plans in the garden for Friday night, do it, it is looking good. The weekend is looking a touch cooler, so the roof might have to close. Let’s look at the outlook for Wimbledon. It is looking mixed. It looked It was blustery earlier, but we cannot complain when there was a tornado of this scale in the Venice area earlier. It looks like there was a major destruction. This is the band of intense thunderstorms which was responsible. Back home, a lot quieter. It has been a dry night for many places. The winds have fallen right, the skies have cleared in most places in temperatures falling well down into single figures across the larger towns and cities in the north and some rural areas are close to freezing atjust some rural areas are close to freezing at just about dawn. By the time most of us are up, temperatures will have bounced back. Set to be a nice day with lighter winds, dry nearly everywhere. Still the odd shower across the northern Scotland for a time. Good news if you’re heading to Wimbledon, there should be a full day’s play. Temperatures not spec regularly high, but the sunshine is very strong so put on sunscreen. Similar for the Ashes at Cardiff. At lipm, some fair weather cloud, very, very small risk of a shallow, dry virtually everywhere. The winds will be lighter so it will feel much more pleasant. High teens, low 20s are typical in the south. Not a bad sort of day. Later, it will cloud over across Northern Ireland. That ",,

And, accused of racist behaviour on the Paris Metro, four Chelsea fans fight an order banning them from matches. Good afternoon, and welcome to the BBC News at One. A Monday to Friday culture in the NHS in England has had ""tragic consequences"", and has to change, according to the Health Secretaryjeremy Hunt. He said 6,000 people a year die because of a lack of senior doctors working at weekends, and he wants to change this within the next five years. The doctors’ union, the British Medical Association, said it did support more seven-day working, but accused Mr Hunt’s plan of being ""too simplistic"". Here’s our health correspondent Sophie Hutchinson. MY My name is Louise, can I take your blood pressure? An outstanding hospital according to inspectors, Salford Royal, one of a feud in the country to run emergency and unplanned care seven days a week. The Government is determined this is the future for the NHS, but it is accusing doctors’s leaders at the BMA of looking at change in their contract to do it. That would require consultants to work outside normal hours. Today, the Health Secretary in England we are to rated research suggesting patients are 15% more likely to die if they are admitted to hospital on Sunday compared to a Wednesday. And every year 6000 people died because hospitals do not run seven day services. Our priority is to reduce the likelihood of people dying if they are admitted at the weekend. People get ill every day of the week. If a doctor with a sense of vocation would not want it any other way than to make sure there was proper senior medical cover at weekends. Mr Hunt’s comments have been described as a wholesale attack on doctors and dismayed some medical students and junior doctors we spoke to. I do find it to. Ido find it insulting to have it suggested doctors are not working hard enough and because of that patients are suffering. We working weekends, and at night, to make sure patients get the care they need and it is insulting. To be told what you’re doing is not good enough feels like a personal attack and we are being made scapegoats for things beyond our control. When I am on the ward, well I have the same support as a junior doctor as now? The BMA says the Government has failed to address the practicalities of delivering 7-day-a-week services. Consultants do work at weekends, I am an NHS consultant, I am scheduled to work next weekend. Consultants are there when patients need us. It is hard to understand what the fuss is about. The Government is failing to invest properly in urgent and emergency services. We want to talk to them about how best to support the standards of care. In the Commons, the Shadow Health Secretary also questioned how it would be financed. This announcement appears to be underfunded and it will not escaped your attention the 2010th Conservative manifesto also promised to deliver seven day services. The Government has said this is not a war against consultants. But it hasissued a war against consultants. But it has issued a deadline telling doctors it has until September to agree to changes to their contract. Let’s get more from our health editor, Hugh Pym. The Government had to abandon plans as recently as last year to bring doctors on board with seven-day working. Why is this time any different? It is interesting, that was in the run-up to a general election and probably the gunmen then did not want a confrontation with senior doctors at a time of pressure on the NHS over winter. Now is different, we have a majority Conservative Government, it is early in Parliament. This is the time to press on with controversial reforms. Part of a move to a 7-day-a-week NHS, a promise David Cameron soon after polling day made as a top priority. jeremy Hunt is expelling the latest phase, to say that consultant cover over weekends as we have heard does need to be beefed up because lives are being lost, and because often routine tests are not carried out over weekends so patients had to stay longer so there is delayed discharging. We have had cynicism from doctors, the BMA saying there are but if you consultants who work on non-emergency care over the weekends. They are happy to do that. This is a smoke screen to divert from the fact resources are challenged. Today, a report out from Lord rose the former boss of the NHS, of Emma death on the NHS leadership issue, has raised a number of challenges facing the NHS. He says the pace of change remains unsustainably high, and the bureaucratic burden is fast becoming insupportable, making it clear there are big challenges for NHS managers in the years ahead. In the last half-an-hour, the Government has been outlining its plans for a review of the BBC. The Culture Secretary, john Whittingdale, told MPs that it wanted to look at whether the corporation had become too big, and examine its impact on the commercial broadcasting sector. Let’s speak to our home editor, Mark Easton, who’s in Westminster. There has been lots of speculation, what did he say? This document is a consultation about the BBC’s place in the broadcasting and media market. To what extent has the role of the BBC which has expanded over the last 20 years, how much showed that role stay as it is, how much should the BBC shrink back to its core purpose of being a public service broadcaster making distinctive programmes? One can see three areas in which the Government is looking to pose particular questions. One is in television, should the BBC be making programmes like Strictly, Sherlock, which arguably commercial companies could make. In radio, should the BBC be riding radio stations like Radio 1 and radio to which arguably the commercial sector could do. Thirdly, in online, the BBC’s substantial footprint on the Internet, is that warping the market against a proper commercial market for other players in news and Internet services? That is the key part. How has the BBC responded? The BBC is glad this is not a hostile document, its tone is not aggressive. But their concern will be that the voice of the licence fee payer does not appear in this document. There is no analysis of research about what people want for their licence fee. That will form part of a consultation. The BBC is keen to ensure whatever discussion we have about the future of the corporation, it does involve in a substantial way the views of the people who pay for it. Cut-price promotions. Special offers. Buy one get one free. They all make it look like shoppers are getting a bargain, but are they? Well, sometimes not, according to the competition regulator. Its three-month investigation, in response to a complaint from the consumer group Which?, found that shoppers are often being misled by confusing promotions. Supermarkets are now being warned they could face legal action, unless they clean up their act. Simon Gompertz reports. We have always been easy prey for promotions. They account for 40% of our spending. Today’s deals misleading? The experts say yes. And no. We did find problems in misleading office. Out of the 150,000 products at five retailers, we found only 800 were problematic promotions, around 0.5%. They agree with Winch on some problem areas, pushing up prices before supposed discounts. Claiming to log that a price is lower when really it is normal price. I don’t always think special offers good value. You get to a point where you expect that is the normal price. It is relatively easy to compare prices. It is often tagged with the price and weight. With special offer items, the wait can be smaller. According to the research, Morrisons sold this for £1 98 the 28 days, then cut the price to £1. But for much longer, 63 days of which was stretching the rules. £2 per £2 50 was the offer that this but research showed it put the single price up at the same time which made the offer look better. Then shrinking pack sizes, this one went down from 100 tea bags, down to just 80. Tesco actually increased the price of the box slightly. The Competition and Markets Authority says it will now work with supermarkets for improvements, clarify the rules for shops and shoppers, and take enforcement action which could lead to find. Retailers seem relaxed about that. We welcome the broad thrust of the report which did not find any evidence of systemic or widespread problems in relation to pricing. They recognised the value which retailers place on good compliance. Some say if we got rid of discounts completely, we would end up paying about the same anyway. The hope is, in the future, they will all be genuine. Our business editor, Kamal Ahmed, is with me. Is anything likely to change for consumers as a result of this finding? Ultimately, probably yes. All the polling has revealed whatever the actual evidence about discounting, the public believes that something is going on that is not quite in its favour. So the public thinks there is a problem. If they do, then usually you do get action in the end. The CMA will take action against specific transgressions of consumer law, but also to make the whole system much more transparent so the public can easily compare how much a can of Coke was last week with how much it is this week. Then there is the Government, any Government led by the new Business Secretary. I am told Richard Lloyd will meet with Nick Boles from the business ministry this afternoon. There could be some action from the Government to demand that laws around consumer protection and discounting are also make much more transparent, much simpler, so this confusing noise that the customers get when you walk through the door of a supermarket is cleaned up. It is likely we will see some action over the next year. Knife crime across England and Wales has risen for the first time in four years. Official figures show that, in the 12 months to April, police recorded 13% more assaults with knives than the previous year. Tougher penalties come into force tomorrow, which will see adults who carry knives locked up on their second conviction. The result of the contest to choose the next leader of the Liberal Democrats will be announced later today. The former party president, Tim Farron, is favourite to defeat the only other candidate, the former Health Minister Norman Lamb. The winner will replace Nick Clegg who resigned after a disastrous general election that left the Lib Dems withjust eight MPs. MPs are to get a 10% pay rise, pushing their salary from just over £67,000 to £7lI,000. That’s the recommendation of the body which sets MPs’ pay, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority. It comes despite calls from many MPs, including the Prime Minister, for pay restraint at a time of austerity. Here’s our political correspondent, Robin Brant. Count them as they go by, one, two, three. There are 650 MPs in all, and you three. There are 650 MPs in all, and YÂU PGY you pay their wages. Wages that have fallen behind beastly, according to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority which sets pay. A rise is coming, that they are confused about. No. I am an MP, I wouldn’t dream of taking Ip more than what I get at the moment. It is a decision made by an independent body, whatever it decides is right, not what MPs decide. The increase is a big one, up from £67,000 a year up to send ÂlIooo a year, a 10% pay rise. The man who made the final decision is not an MP or a politician. He is independent. The independent Thejob independent. The job is such that it calls for a proper salary as well as it calls of getting rid of things which are completely out of touch with the modern world. The timing couldn’t be worse because a week ago millions of other public workers got this news about their pay. We will continue recent public sector pay awards with a rise of 1% a year for the next four years. Another pay freeze for four years will stop in light of that, the promised has fought against the increase and all the contenders to be the next Labour leader say they will reject it. The problem is David Cameron is not in charge of MPs’s PaY~ pay. It is PaY~ It is an independent body that decides what they will learn every year and there is nothing they can do about it. They could change the law and take back control of their pay and expenses. They could give them money away to charity. Or keep it. It is cost neutral to the taxpayer. No cost to the taxpayer. Without it, we will end up with a parliament populated by the mad, the rich and those who can’t do anything else. MPs can’t refuse the money that goes into their pay slip automatically but they will have to decide what they do with it. Our top story this lunchtime. The Health Secretary, jeremy Hunt, says he wants to see more senior doctors working at the weekend.

We see how Lord’s has been preparing for the first day of the second Ashes Test. There was fierce opposition to the new EU bailout plan for Greece last night - both inside parliament and out on the streets of Athens. The rescue package was approved by MPs, but some within the governing party itself voted against it. The bitterness showed itself outside, with petrol bombs thrown at police. They responded with tear gas and stun grenades. Let’s cross to Athens, and to our correspondent, Tanya Beckett. Yes come Greece does now Yes COITIE Greece does I’IOW BppÃaf be steadily moving along a path to securing third bail out in five years, but it’s not without controversy. There is opposition, a reluctance notjust controversy. There is opposition, a reluctance not just amongst the Greek people, but also within the government itself. There were angry scenes inside the Greek parliament last night, as MPs from all parties raged at being forced to pass austerity measures demanded by the country’s Eurozone lenders. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said it was a bad deal for Greece, but warned the alternative could be much worse. The mood outside the building was equally tense. Rioters threw petrol bombs and police responded with tear gas. The Greek parliament voted on a package of tax increases, pension reforms and a commitment to liberalise the labour markets. Now this has been agreed, Greece is hoping for a cash injection by Monday of 7 billion euros to avoid bankruptcy. TRANSLATION: I hope for the best because the government had the majority needed. They say here in Greece a bad deal is better than no deal. TRANSLATION: Of course I’m relieved, I believe not signing would be the destruction of my country. It’s the morning after the night before at the Athens parliament building and here in front of it there is scarcely any reminder of the angry riots that took place last night. just on the road, a few scorched remnants, a reminder of the petrol bombs that were thrown by demonstrators. Now Greece is trying to move on, but other Eurozone countries will be watching closely to ensure it delivers on its promises. A numberof A number of questions still remain unanswered. How will Greece get the money? It’s not fully agreed to reopen its banks, which is such an urgent steps in order that the economy can begin to move on. It has payments to the European Central Bank and the understanding is that 7 billion euros will be made available in order to pay those back, but there remains division within the government and talk of snap elections in the autumn. A council in London has dropped a case against a family who’ve been educating their son at home. The family of 11-year-old Gabriel Sotello insist they have the right to educate their children without any intervention from education authorities. Here’s our education correspondent Robert Piggott. 11-year-old Gabriel Sotelo has never been to school. He is among more than 27,000 home educated children on council records. His mother, Sophie, also educated her older son, Luke. Gabriel is studying computer coding, or programming, which, he says, helps him with a wish and maths as well. He says pursuing his own interests helps him to learn. In school, itjust goes on and on and in the end you barely learn anything, but with home education you can learn at your own pace and you do learn much quicker. Recent figures suggest the number of children learning at home in England has increased by 17% in a year. Under current law, they don’t have to follow the national curriculum, nor do they have to take formal tests. Forthe nor do they have to take formal tests. For the family, even a walk in the neighbourhood is a learning opportunity. Sophie Sotello says she doesn’t teach Gabriel, more points in the right direction. But Kensington and Chelsea Council took Sophie Sotello to court, when she failed to satisfy them he was getting a suitable education. The council says it has since received that evidence, but but Sophie Sotello says it should not have interfered in the first place. It is the council’s approach. Legally, we studied the law very well. They have no duty for elective home educators. They have duty for children missing education, joints, that’s difference. There is a grey area in the law governing home-schooling. There is no legal duty to monitor the quality of home education on a routine basis, nevertheless Chuck -- Kensington and Chelsea Council say they believe they have a duty of care to establish the child is receiving a suitable education. Home-schooling parents meeting in a London park say they can do better than schools to prepare their children for a rapidly changing world. They claim councils have no right to investigate how they are doing it. Unless there is evidence that something is wrong. With the numbers of home-schooled children increasing, further conflict seems inevitable. Universities in England have agreed to take more students from poorer homes. The Office for Fair Access - which exists to give disadvantaged students more opportunities - says too many young people with talent are rejecting higher education because of the expense. Nearly two-thirds of children in poverty now live in families where their parents work, according to a report on living standards by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. It found the rate of child poverty in working families had risen over the past five years, largely because of the drop in real wages. The Ililith Open is underway at St Andrews. And all eyes are on 21-year-old jordan Spieth - who’s aiming to win his third major title of the year. Let’s cross to St Andrews and our sports correspondent, Andy Swiss. The Open was one of the oldest tournaments in the world and traditionally gets one of the toughest full stop over the years, we’ve seen many of the world’s finest golfers struggle stormy conditions. This morning has by and large been a very different story. We have had like wins and some great golf. The so-called home of golf has rarely seemed so inviting. A gentle breeze, idealweather rarely seemed so inviting. A gentle breeze, ideal weather is for players and fans, and the hunt for birdies was soon under way. The early scoring was suitably impressive, especially one unlikely name, Sweden’s David Lingmerth, on his Open debut, firing a remarkable seven birdies in the first nine holes. But the stars were soon in pursuit. jordan Spieth. jordan Spieth, the bookies’ favourite, aiming for a record third major title in a row, and he was soon off to another dazzling start. Five birdies in the first seven holes. A beauty, excellent, excellent. But not everyone was finding life quite so easy. Tiger Woods is now ranked just 2lI1st in the world and this is why. Second shot into the water, oh dear. And it didn’t get any easier. This pretty much summed things up. A string of dropped shots, leaving Tiger Woods looking worried. Elsewhere, the American challenge was ticking along nicely. Dustin johnson climbing the leaderboard. While lI6-year-old Rajeev Goosen was rolling back the years. -- While lI6-year-old Rajeev Goosen was rolling back the years. -- Retief Goosen. His six under was among the best of the early bunch.

Dustinjohnson and Dustin johnson and Paul Lawrie are currently leading seven under par. jordan Spieth is a couple of shots off the pace but real problems for Tiger Woods. off the pace but real problems for TigerWoods. He is off the pace but real problems for Tiger Woods. He is currently five over par and Tiger Woods. He is currently five over parand his over par and his chances of winning the Open already pretty much seem over. And it’s also day one of the second Test between England and Australia at Lord’s, with the visitors finding runs easy to come by during the morning session. The tourists won the toss and decided to bat and at lunch had scored 104-1. Our sports correspondent, joe Wilson, was watching the play and he’s at Lord’s now. just a bit of lunchtime traffic here. Yesterday, Alastair Cook told me to remember that Australia are still favourites for the Ashes, despite England winning the first Test and the play we have seen so far today bears that out. Do bear in mind that Australia won the toss, so had the advantage of batting first, with Lord’s at its most pristine. This may well be the most meticulously manicured piece of turf in the land. The Lord’s wicket, prepared by hand, by mortal man. Patience is the approach at this place. Technically, Lord’s has far more members than seats. Hold on, you’ll get there. This kind of proximity is the privilege they queue for. Mind you, England’s supporters would rather have seen their team walk out to bat. Instead, Australia had the chance to impose themselves, batting first. That one just eluded England’s fielders, clutching at thin air in the first over of the match. Chances are, chances won’t come often. This ball guided for four by Chris Rogers. David Warner is never quiet for too long at the crease. He needs the reassurance of the ball reaching the boundary. Broad bowling to Rogers. Now, how did that miss everything? The batsman certainly didn’t know. Ah, but he was still there. Sometimes knowing your limits is the secret of Test match batting. Warner was feeling good, but where has that gone? Straight into the hands of james Anderson and England have their first wicket. England’s coaching staff watched. Is that a kangaroo behind them? There’s a lot of knowledge about the Australians in the home dressing room. Recently, Steve Smith has made a lot of runs in various places. There’s nothing quite like making them here. Steve Smith will resume in a few minutes’ time, 16-0, with him, Chris Rogers, 43-0. Australia, 104-1, feeling happy. Time for a look at the weather. A decent afternoon in prospect, sunny spells for many, feeling rather humid. You are getting ready for a butt. rather humid. You are getting ready fora butt. It’s for a butt. It’s the shape of this raft of cloud, an area of low pressure impinging on the western part. All the way a long way from Lord’s, it will not interrupt proceedings for two or three days. At St Andrews, the players are having it easy at the moment, the conditions will intervene over the next couple of days. Hazy sunshine quite widely spread through the course of the afternoon. We will see that cloud and rain impinging on the south-west of Northern Ireland. We are at 24 Celsius in Essex, we will see 26-27 across the south-east, so feeling close. Then comes the wind and rain. With showers breaking out with the heat in the south-east, migrating further northwards. A rumble of thunder in there, maybe further north, it will be a close night for sleeping. Tomorrow, a lot of rain pushed across Scotland and this weather front in the South, not much on it but it introduces fresher conditions. The cloud, wind-macro and rain quits the north of the mainland, the showers ganging up later in the day, as the tail end of the weather front comes back in to affect much of Northern Ireland. Wet and windy for the Northern Isles for much of the day. Sunshine in the eastern side of Scotland. Blustery it at St Andrews. The temperatures may not look that different but with the fresher air from the Atlantic there will be a cooler, fresher feel to the day across many parts, despite temperatures pushing to around 20 Celsius for many.

And the Chelsea fans accused of racist rants challenge a ban which would prevent them from attending football matches. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News At Six. The Health Secretary, jeremy Hunt, has issued a blunt warning to senior hospital doctors in England, saying he’s prepared to impose a new contract forcing them to work over seven days. Ministers want to tackle the higher likelihood of death on Saturdays and Sundays, claiming 6,000 people a year die because of a ""Monday to Friday culture"". Wales and Northern Ireland are set to follow the same policy. Scotland is considering it. The doctors’ union the BMA questioned how the move would be funded and staffed. Here’s Hugh Pym. Ministers now want all consultants to be available if needed at weekends. A doctor with a sense of vocation would not want it any other way than to make sure there was proper senior medical cover at weekends. Want it involve extra cost, because you are paying consultants more to work at weekends? What we’re proposing today won’t involve reducing the paid to consultants, because we think we will need more consultants overall to deliver seven-day service. The overall pay bill may go up. He says there are needless deaths at weekends because of inadequate staffing and Martin Russell agrees. His 92-year-old mother was admitted with gastric problems on a Saturday and died two weeks later, he thinks because she wasn’t seen by a senior doctor. It was as if she wasn’t in hospital, just given a bed without medicine, so that is key. But doctors are angry at the suggestion they put patients at risk because they won’t work at weekends. jeremy Hunt’s approach has been aggressive and insulting to doctors, implying we are not working weekends to provide care to patients, which we are. I am concerned that if we don’t have the resources put in, then we are going to end up very thinly stretched. In total, the NHS in England has more than 104,000 hospital doctors, including just over 41,000 consultants, the most senior level. Consultants in A&E are expected to work evenings and weekends but others can opt out of hours outside 7am to 7pm on weekdays, but that will change for newly qualified consultants. The reality is that many leading hospitals, including this one, have already moved towards a full seven-day week service for all non-emergency care, with no shortage of consultants willing to work weekends if required to help achieve that. That has been possible here at this hospital in north London after negotiations between managers and consultants. We have been able to improve patient access to care in the evenings and at weekends by our staff all coming together, with a great deal of professionalism and commitment, to make sure they are focused on keeping patients save, regardless of the time of day or night. Last year, jeremy Hunt appointed the former boss of Marks & Spencer, Lord Rose, to review NHS leadership. Today his report was published. He says change in the NHS has been unsustainably high and managers have been distracted by Whitehall and regulators. It is a reminder of how tough it could be moving the NHS to a full seven-day service. How often do you see two-for-the-price-of-one, 50% off, and Buy One Get One Free? These offers may look like bargains. But the competition regulator says that’s not always the case. Its three month investigation found that shoppers are often misled by confusing promotions. Supermarkets are being warned they could face legal action if they fail to make prices more transparent. Kamal Ahmed reports. It’s enough to give you a headache. Money off, two offers, discounts galore. Now it appears that some of those super bargains are not quite as super as they may seem. Customers in Manchester had mixed views on how special the special offers are. I don’t always think they are good value. You get to a point where you expect that is the normal price and thatis expect that is the normal price and that is what you are prepared to pay. As long as it is clear and they have a certain price and this much Ofcom I think it is a good. The competition watchdog was responding to a complaint from the committee -- the consumers Association, which said shoppers were being misled. So what are they claiming was going on? Take this bottle of orange squash. It used to cost £1. Then the supermarket concerned started advertising it as two for £2.50. That is clearly a price increase, but were customers aware? Or Twinings tea bags, which used to cost £4 for 100, but when the pack size was reduced to 80, one supermarket but the price up. The head of Which? Told me it was time for action. head of Which? Told me it was time foraction. Now for action. Now that these findings have confirmed what millions of shoppers know to be true, we need the enforcement of existing rules by the regulator, and we will be talking to the minister today about what the government needs to do to tighten up the rules, so there is no doubt about what retailers have to do to play by their shoppers. The regulator said that supermarkets did try and stick to the rules as often as possible and representatives of the sector said the report was not all bad news. We welcome the broad thrust of the report, which found no evidence of systemic or widespread problems in relation to pricing. Indeed, they recognised the value which retailers place on good compliance. Sources close to the Government say they are now looking at cleaning up the rules on house sales are sold to the public. This council will be made simpler to understand, hopefully leading to fewer headaches on every visit to the supermarket. MPs are to get a 10% pay rise, pushing their salary from just over £67,000 to £74,000. That’s the decision of the body which sets MPs’ pay, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority. It comes despite calls from many MPs, including the Prime Minister, for pay restraint at a time of austerity. Alex Forsyth reports. Politicians know that their pay is a toxic issue, made more so now a 10% rise has been decided by the independent body that sets their salaries. It has divided opinion, even here in Westminster. MPs act knowledge they work hard but many on all sides of the political divide don’t agree with this pay rise. The best people to be MPs are passionate about their communities and want to serve their communities. If they are looking at the money, I think they are looking at the wrong kind of job. MPs currently get just over £67,000 a year, which will rise to £74,000. Future rises will be linked to public sector pay. At the same time, MPs have had their pensions, expenses and other allowances cut, so the overall package will not cost the taxpayer a penny more, according to the independent body that sets the pay. Thejob is such that to the independent body that sets the pay. The job is such that it calls for a proper salary, as well as it calls for reductions in pensions, as well as it calls for getting rid of things which were completely out of touch with the modern world. After the scandal over MPs expenses, decisions over pay were taken out of the hands of politicians to try and restore public trust, and some MPs think this pay deal, set independently, is the right thing. It is actually cost neutral to the taxpayer, no cost at all. Without it we will end up with a parliament only populated by the mad, the rich and those who can’t do anything else. While MPs will get double-digit pay rises, staff at this hospital, within sight of Parliament, are among public sector workers who will see their pay rises capped at 1% for the next four years. And some don’t think that is fair. They need to sit down and maybe work a week in a hospital to understand what it is like for normal people before they give themselves pay rise is. We all work hard, most people in the population worked really hard. I work for the public sector. I’m not getting any 10% pay rise, so why should they? The extra funds will end up in MPs PHY The extra funds will end up in MPs pay packets whether they like it or not, but it is their choice as to whether they keep it. And some from all parties have said they will be giving theirs away. Tonight, the Prime Minister was asked whether he will keep the money. He said it would enable people to give more to charity. He doesn’t agree with this rise, and neither do those wanting to be the next Labour leader. While for some this is a fair deal addressing a difficult issue which has been docked for years, for others it is simply unjustified, and they worry that the public will feel the same. Knife crime across England and Wales has risen for the first time in four years, according to the Office for National Statistics. The figures show that in the 12 months to April, police recorded 13% more assaults with knives than the previous year. Tomorrow, tougher penalties come into force which will see adults who carry knives receive a prison sentence on their second conviction. The future of the BBC is under scrutiny as the Government today launched a consultation on its size and scope. The Culture Secretary, john Whittingdale, said the review would look at whether the broadcaster should be ""all things to all people"" or whether it should more precisely target its audience. The BBC warned the review could lead to a ""much diminished, less popular"" service. Here’s Mark Easton. The latest miracle in electrical communication, the building might how is that transmitters, control rooms... just as Alexandra Palace was renovated to house the BBC in the first broadcast age, now the government is suggesting the BBC needs an overhaul in the new internet age. Good morning, everybody. Among the ideas is that the corporation should be much smaller and cheaper, focusing on distinctive public service broke -- programming that the market will not provide. The Culture Secretary told Parliament the BBC’s new charter was an opportunity to ask questions about its scale and scope. We must question whether the BBC should try to be all things to all people, to serve everyone on every platform, or SâI’Vâ âVâI’yoIâ1â OI’] âVâI’y pl3tfoI’TT’I, oI’ if it serve everyone on every platform, or if it should have a more precisely targeted mission. Should it be smaller? That is one of the issues. Do you think it should be? I don’t want to set any constraint or limits to the debate. Some would argue the BBC does not need to do as much, some might argue it needs to do more in certain areas. 20 years ago the BBC had two TV channels and five radio stations. Now it offers nine television channels, numerous radio stations and an online service covering everything from news to recipes and the weather. Competitors complained that across its output the publicly funded corporation is undermining commercial business opportunities. In television, should the BBC continue to make rating chasing programmes like Strictly, when they could be made by commercial companies? In radio, could Radio 1, or radio to be paid for by adverts, rather than the licence fee? An online, does the BBC’s huge footprint on the internet undermine business opportunities that newspapers might like to exploit? I think the most important people in this debate are the audiences, licence fee payers, in a sense they are our shareholders. I hope their views and what they think about what we do is going to come to the fore in this debate. So, is a root and branch review strictly necessary? We asked people across Britain. The BBC has been its own powerhouse for so long and is probably time changed a little. I have looked at Canada, CNN, Fox News, the BBC is hard to beat. I don’t know whether they can change it or not. Cut out the licence fee maybe! A plan to decriminalise nonpayment of the TV licence has been shelved but in the long term the licence fee looks doomed. Instead, there may be payment by subscription or a household levy. The tone of today’s review is hardly hostile but it’s questions go to the core of the BBC’s existence, and the answers, expected in about three months, may seal its fate. The Health Secretary says senior doctors must be prepared to work weekends - jeremy Hunt said a ‘Monday to Friday’ culture in the NHS was costing thousands of lives. Later on BBC London. Plans to relax Sunday trading hours in the West End. We hear from those for and against the idea. And the primary schoolchildren embracing American football with a little help from NFL coaches. In the past decade, 5,500 unaccompanied children have escaped from war-torn Afghanistan to reach the UK. Many have been allowed to stay in Britain temporarily and have been raised by foster families. But on reaching 18 they have to re-apply for asylum - and must return to Afghanistan if their case is rejected. In the last five years, more than 600 of these young asylum seekers have been deported - according to figures obtained from the Government. Chris Rogers has been talking to some of those who’ve been living here. This man is a lifeguard in Birmingham, local hero who has saved lives. He fled the conflict in Afghanistan alone, aged just 11, arriving in the UK and illegal immigrant. He has no idea what came of his parents. His British foster family all he has now. But when he reached 18, they had to apply for asylum or leave the UK. He lost his case and now faces deportation. It’s so upsetting, you realise that right, we have got a fight on. I built my life here, someone wants to come and take it from me, that’s not right. They will argue they have looked after you and predicted you as a child commits time be due to go home. But the war is not over. Linda has fostered to asylum seekers. By Zell is next to go. I feel that they are pawns in this political process. Anybody who wants to get political gain can say, we have sent this many people back. He is now on the move, lying on friends, trying to avoid being picked up by immigration officers. -- being picked up by immigration officers. -- relying on friends. But the government say when people establish a genuine need for protection, although founded fear of persecution, refuge will be granted. Every month, child asylum seekers are deported to couple, despite the Foreign Office advising Britons against travel to Afghanistan. Military presence, armed police or the army, is a permanent reminder that this is a city on the edge, the Taliban can strike any time, anywhere.

And you can see more on that story on Our World on the BBC News Channel on Saturday and Sunday evening at 9.30pm. The former party President Tim Farron has been elected the new leader of the Liberal Democrats - beating the only other candidate, Norman Lamb. He replaces Nick Clegg, who resigned after the party’s disastrous General Election left it with just 8 MPs. Let’s join Vicki Young, who’s at a party rally in central London. Tim Farron has an enormous task in trying to rebuild the party? That’s right, this is thejob he has cleaned up holding the several years but many will think he has just been handed a rather large poisoned chalice as tries to resurrect his party, reduced tojust chalice as tries to resurrect his party, reduced to just eight MPs. He says he wants to be a spiky leader who says things that attract attention. The problem at the moment is most people have never heard of him. So what do we know about the new Lib Dem leader? The 45-year-old has been an MP for a seat in the Lake District since 2005. During a coalition with the Conservatives, he was one ofjust a few didn’t hold a job as a minister and he voted against the controversial rise in tuition fees. He is much closer to labour than he is to the Conservatives. There was concern from some that is Christian faith meant he didn’t wholeheartedly back 9aY meant he didn’t wholeheartedly back gay rights. His critics say he lacks judgment and politicalfashion but his band say he will bring enthusiasm and energy to the job, he speaks from the heart. His big challenge in the coming months is to convince voters that the Liberal Democrats are worth listening to at all. Well, it’s been a bumper day for British sport, with the second Ashes test underway at Lord’s and the start of the Open Championship at St Andrews. We’ll have the latest from there in a moment with Andy Swiss, but first joe Wilson is at Lord’s. You can generate the occasion, you can’t control what happens. That is the essence of sport. Some fairly standard supporters leaving the ground today. England took one wicket, Australia scored 337 runs after they won the toss in conditions pretty much perfect batting. This may well be the most meticulously manicured piece of turf in the land. The Lord’s pitch, prepared by hand by mortal man. Patience is the approach at this place. Technically, Lord’s has far more members than seats. Hold on, you’ll get there. This kind of proximity is the privilege they queue for. Mind you, that was England walking out to field, and that was the problem. Australia batting first in pristine conditions. That one just eluded England’s fielders, clutching at thin air in the first over, and sometimes thereafter. David Warner likes to see the ball reaching the boundary, that’s his style. Mooen Ali on to bowl. Warner reckoned he could whack him anywhere but sometimes ego leads to a downfall, straight to Anderson. Australia 78-1. Chris Rodgers once again passed 50, just a milestone, but there is safety in numbers as this Australian tour group will testify. Oh, you wore a yellow cap as well? Steve Smith had just reached his 50 when he had an opportunity, tough but not a day to miss catches and no one needed to tell Ian Bell. The only real tension through the afternoon was the race to reach a century, which batsman would get there first? Steve Smith made it. Chris Rodgers has a habit of approaching 100 and losing his wicket. Not this time, he controlled his nerves. He’s 37 years old and plans to retire at the end of this series. England can’t wait. An eventful day at Lord’s and the pretty lively one here as well. The Open Championship is one of the toughest golf tournaments in the world and it is -- toughest golf tournaments in the world and it is -- Tetley was today for Tiger Woods but for others it has been far easier. The so-called home of golf has rarely seemed so inviting. A gentle breeze to greet the players, and the hunt for birdies was soon under way. But for all the talents on show, the focus was on one in particular. jordan Spieth. He’sjust 21 and aiming for a third major in a row, but ifjordan Spieth was feeling the pressure, he didn’t show it. An impressive round of five under including this at the final hole, putting him right in contention. But as his star rises, another continues to fall. Tiger Woods, now ranked just 241st in the world, and that set the tone for a round in which form and luck largely deserted him. At four over, surely so are his chances. Those looking for some British success, though, found Paul Lawrie. Not that it was easy. Here he is somewhere behind that number 15. But from that rather unpromising position, he conjured the shot of the day. Lawrie, who won back in 1999, six under after a stunning round. That is just one adrift of the early leader, America’s Dustinjohnson. With wind and rain forecast tomorrow, the Open challenge could be about to get a whole lot tougher. An eco-house in Wales has become the UK’s first home to be built to create more energy than it uses. The three bedroom property in Bridgend tookjust 16 weeks to make - its designers hope it will be the first of many. Our Wales Correspondent Hywel Griffith is inside the house now. Yes, some pretty big claims being made about is quite compact construction, chiefly that it is a compact, cashback three-bedroom house so that for every pound the occupant Spence, they could claim to bounce back by selling the energy back into the National Grid. That partly comes through the roof, one built out of solar panels. The sun doesn’t shine all day so there is a battery to store the energy. If you look outside, there are big seven facing windows, helping bring energy in, smaller windows facing north to stop energy going out and big black panels that help to heat up the air that flows through the house. There are no radiators, the hot air is piped in the way round and they claim it is more likely to overheat them beating cold in winter. To keep a close eye on that, it is an energy panel and the most of the day it has been putting out more energy than it has been taken in. You helped clean this place up, we have seen so many prototypes like this, they are not often built again, why is this different? It isjust taken 16 often built again, why is this different? It is just taken 16 weeks to build a real combine technologies that are available on the market. That sounds very expensive, how realistic that this could be built for a market price? Were butchered for around £1000 per metre squared, for a typical three-bedroom house would be around £125,000. I will just take you through to the kitchen, a lot of developers are looking at this, the whole sector is under pressure to cut energy, with 80% reductions needed in carbon emissions by 2050. Time for the weather. A lot of fine and dry weather across the country but not for all, further west, the rain is gathering. Some thunderstorms are coming in Kent. We could see some other thunderstorms in central and eastern areas, trundling northwards, a lot of lightning around. Quite an unsettled night, again quite my DUP don’t like the humidity. More rain coming back into northern Scotland, this weather front shouldn’t cause too many issues at Lord’s, just a bit of cloud around and the weather is set fair for the most part the next two or three days but it looks more interesting for the golfers, contending with strong and gusty winds. Temperatures on the face of things look similar but it will feel much fresher and we will probably have more sunshine but the northern Ireland, more showers, and Western and Central Scotland. And tomorrow, late in the day we could see Gale force winds from Northern Ireland, parts of Scotland and northern England, that is unusually windy for this time of year, combined with shower after shower, this time of year, combined with showerafter shower, it shower after shower, it doesn’t look particularly pleasant. The best of the weather through the weekend will be across the southern half of the country. Similar on Sunday although we might get a dry night on Saturday night for Scotland and Northern Ireland but more rain to you we think. Tonight on BBC London News.

Mark Carney the Governor of the Bank of England said tonight that rates would rise gradually over the next few years. Rates have been at record low levels for six years as the economy recovers from the financial crisis. The need for Bank Rate to rise the momentum in the economy and a gradualfirming of underlying inflationary pressures.

Tonight on BBC London: Tougher sentences for carrying a knife come into force - hours after figures show a rise in knife crime. And what our medics are learning from America - to help make our hospitals the safest in the world. Good evening. Interest rates could begin to rise as we move into 2016, ending a long period of record-low rates. Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, said tonight that he expected the bank rate to increase slowly over the next few years, rising eventually to around 2.5 per cent. But he warned that shocks to the economy and changes in the exchange rate could affect the timing. Our Economics Editor Robert Peston has more details. For our finances, mortgages, the value of our houses, not a lot matters more than interest rates. Tonight in this unlikely setting, the Gough nor of the Bank of England went further than he has done in guiding that interest rates are going up. Perhaps in December or january. In my view the decision as to when to start such a process will likely come into sharper relief around the turn of this year. But if you had big debts and you are breaking into a cold sweat, he said not to panic but if a saver, you will not like this. It will not seem unreasonable to me to expect that once monetary policy normalisation begins, interest rates would proceed slowly and rise to a level in the medium-term, that is perhaps about half as high as historic averages. So, if we go back to the 1970s, the Bank of England’s interest rates set by the Chancellor, was frequently in double digits, peaking at 17%. Since the 1990s, the rate has been on a declining path after the Bank of England was given control of the rate in 1997. In twine at the height of the worst recession since the 30s, the interest rate cut to its lowest level in more than 3 hundred years, a half a percent and it’s been stuck there. It is because the governor thinks that the cost of living will start to rise in a few months, he is warning annish initial rise of a quarter of a percent and further rises in the next three years to over 2%. At some point the interest rates will go up. Will it be a good thing? Not for me, I have a rather large mortgage. But for the country, they would be happy. I would be happy if the savings are getting more interest. We have organised our lives for so long, for it 20 jump up it would be difficult for our personal lives. But from the economy perspective, it must go up. So, drowning our sorrows or toasting better times? The UK economy has consumer confidence at a 15-year high. Unemployment is lower than 12 months ago and a situation where with real wages rising at 3.2%, the economy can absorb small and gradual interest rate rises. The bell tolling for the cheaper money in recorded history. But is the British economy strong of nor interest rate rises? or will even a tiny rise scare us into not spending and saving enough to keep the economy growing? Robert is with me. You mentioned relief for the savers but what are the risks? It may is not the timing, that is a bid out. The inflation is 0%. He thinks what is driving down inflation, that is low oil prices, falling commodity prices will have washed out of the system by then. But there is another thing. I have been banging on for weeks about the dangers in the world, China slowing down, that could get worse, the second biggest economy in the world but more importantly, Greece is still a big risk of them tumbling from the eurozone causing a big shock to the prosperity of the whole of the European Union, including the UK. The chief economist of the Bank of England, a chap called Andy Holdane, warned that we are all of us still scarred by the terrible 2007, 2008 crash, and he thinks even a tiny rise in interest rates could get us to reign in our spending, reign in investment if you run a company, more than would be the case in the past as we are more, I suppose neurotic, about the prospects than we used to be. That said, this is the important point, the growth in the British economy is robust, as fast as anywhere in the developed world and he thinks that actually the sooner that we get used to the idea, that interest rates are rising, that the sooner we adjust finances and as a result we will be able to absorb that particular shock a little better when it comes. Thank you very much. Hospital consultants in England have been told they can expect a new contract that includes seven-day working unless they reach agreement with the Government. Wales and Northern Ireland are set to do the same, Scotland is considering it. jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, says the ‘Monday to Friday’ culture has had ‘tragic consequences’ with thousands of people dying every year because of a lack of senior doctors working at weekends. But the British Medical Association says most doctors already work a full week, as our Health Editor Hugh Pym explains. This is what ministers want, an NHS fully staffed around the clock, seven days a week. They say consultants most lose their opt-out for weekend working and a blunt emergency for the doctors’ union. They are not remotely in touch with what their members actually believe. I have yet to meet a consultant who would be happy for their own family to be admitted on a weekend or would not prefer to get test results back more quickly for their own patients. But, I ask him, doesn’t the seven-day policy come with a price tag? Won’t it involve extra cost because you’re paying consultants more to work at weekends? What we are proposing today will not involve reducing the pay to consultants. We think that we will need more consultants overall to deliver a seven-day service. The overall pay, although, may go up. He says that there are needless deaths at weekends because of inadequate staffing. Martin Russell agrees. His 92-year-old mother was admitted with gastric problems on a Saturday, and died two days later, he thinks, because she was not seen by a senior doctor. Throughout her weekend admission really, it was as if my mum was not in hospital, she was just given a bed without the medicine. That really is key. But doctors are angry at the suggestion that they are putting patients at risk. They question if the hospitals have the resources for a full 24/7 working. jeremy hunt’s approach today has been very aggressive, jeremy Hunt’s approach today has almost insulting to doctors and implies that we are not working weekends, providing care for patients, which we are. I’m concerned that if we don’t have the resource put in to make the work happen at weekends that he wants to have happen at weekends, this planned care, then we will be very, very thinly stretched. In total NHS England has more than 104,000 hospital doctors, that includes just over 41,000 consultants, the most senior level. Consultants in A&E are expected to work evenings and weekends. Others can currently opt out of working on Saturday and Sunday - that will change for newly qualified surgeons. The reality is that many leading hospitals have already moved some way towards the full seven day a week service for all nonemergency care with no shortage of consultants willing to work at weekends if required to achieve that. At the Whittington in North London, for example, they have negotiated their own seven-day working, which raises the question as to why the Government needs to try to impose it centrally. Caught me out there! Last year Mr Hunt appointed the former boss of Marks & Spencer, Lord Rose, to review NHS leadership. Today his report was published. He says that change in the NHS has been unsustainably high and managers distracted by Whitehall and regulators. A reminder of how tough it could be moving the NHS to a full seven-day service. MPs are to get a 10% pay rise, pushing their salary from just over £67,000 to £74,000. That’s the recommendation of the body which sets MPs’ pay - the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority. It comes despite calls from many MPs - including the Prime Minister- for pay restraint at a time of austerity. Our Political Correspondent Alex Forsyth has more details. Politicians know their pay is a toxic issue, made more so now a 10% rise has been decided by the independent body that sets their salaries. It’s divided opinion, even here in Westminster. Some MPs from all political parties don’t think they should get more. The best people to become MPs are the people passionate about their communities and the ones that serve their communities. If they are looking at the money, I think that they are looking at the wrong kind ofjob. MPs currently get £67,000 a year, to rise to £74,000. Future rises will be linked to public sector pay. At the same time, the MPs have had their pensions, expenses and other allowances cut, so that the overall package will not cost the taxpayer a penny more, according to the independent body that sets pay. The job is such that it calls for a proper salary, as well as it calls for reductions in pensions, as well as it calls for getting rid of things which were completely out of touch with the modern world. After the scandal over MPs’ expenses, decisions over pay were taken out of politicians’ hands to restore public trust. Some think this is a fair deal. It is cost-nuetral to the taxpayer. So no cost at all to the taxpayer. And without it we will end up with a Parliament only populated by the mad, the rich and those who can’t do anything else. While MPs will get double digit pay rises, staff at this hospital, within sight of Parliament, are among public sector workers to see their pay raises capped at 1% for the next four years. Some don’t think that is fair. Work a week at the hospital to understand what it is like for the normal people before they start giving themselves pay rises before the people that are actually doing all the hard work. I work for the public sector. I’m not getting a 10% pay rise, why should they? Interviewed in Cornwall, the Prime Minister said that the pay rise was wrong but like all MPs, he will receive it regardless and must decide whether to keep it. I will be paid the rate that an MP is paid. That is what MPs should do, in my view. That is the right way to go about it. Are you handing it back? Giving it up, giving it to charity? I give money to charity and this will obviously enable people to give more money to charity but I think that is a private matter. But it is a matter of public perception. Some senior MPs on all sides say that they won’t keep the extra cash. For some it is a deserved realignment with pay and other professions, for others it is unjustified. Four US marines have been shot dead by a gunman in an attack on a military buildings in the city of Chattanooga in Tennessee. The gunman opened fire on a recruiting centre, in a row of shops, before driving to another Navy facility nearby where the killings took place. There are also reports of a number of injured, including a policeman. Officers then shot the gunman dead. Our North America Editorjon Sopel is in Washington. Any details on the gunman and possible motives? He is 94-year-old Mohammed Daodu abusive, thought to be a naturalised American citizen, who originally came from the Gulf region, possibly can wait. Investigators are looking at whether his actions were inspired by so-called Islamic State. We’ve heard that the department of homeland security is stepping up security at federal buildings. They say out of an abundance of caution. Barack Obama has arrived back here at the White House in the last five minutes, to be briefed on the situation. It is striking that last week the director of the FBI gave evidence to the Senatejudiciary Committee, where he talked about the dangers of a Lone Wolf gunman, picking out a soft military target and there had been a huge increase in Twitter traffic from so-called Islamic State supporters, urging people in America to launch an attack of this nature. There is much that we don’t know about this particular attack, that we don’t know about this particularattack, but particular attack, but it is striking, the similarities come up with what the FBI director was warning about. Fighters from the Egyptian branch of so-called Islamic State, or Isis, say they’ve fired a guided missile at an Egyptian navy vessel off the coast of Northern Sinai. They posted pictures online which appeared to show a missile about to strike the vessel and a fireball after impact. An army spokesman said a coastguard vessel was involved in an exchange of fire but it suffered no losses. The Government has published its consultation document on the future of the BBC, promising a thorough review of the scale and activity of the Corporation. The Culture Secretary, john Whittingdale, said a decision had to be made on whether the BBC should try to do 'all things’ or become more 'precise’. But the BBC responded by saying the review suggested ‘a much diminished BBC’ and insisted the voice of the public had to be heard on the BBC’s future. Our Home Editor Mark Easton has the story. ARCHIVE: The latest miracle in the electrical communication, the building to house the transmitters, controlrooms. .. just as Ally Pally was renovated to house the BBC in the first broadcast age, now the Government is suggesting that the BBC needs an overhaul in the new internet age. Among the ideas is that the Corporation should be smaller and cheaper, focussing on distinctive public service programming that the market will not provide. Culture Secretary, john Whittingdale told told Parliament the BBC’s new charter was an opportunity to ask questions about its scale and its scope. We must at least question whether the BBC should try to be all things to all people, to serve everyone across every platform, or whether it should be have a more precisely targeted mission. Smaller, should it be smaller? That is one of the issues... Do you think it should be smaller? I don’t want to set any restraint or limits to the debate. There may be some people who argue that the BBC doesn’t need to do as much, there may be people who argue it should do more in certain areas. 20 years ago, the BBC had two TV channels and five radio stations. Now it offers nine television channels, numerous radio stations and an online service that covers everything from news to recipes to the weather. Competitors complain that across its output, the publicly funded Corporation is now undermining commercial business opportunities. In television, should the BBC continue to make rating-chasing programmes like The Voice and Strictly, when they could be made by commercial companies? In radio, could Radio 1 or Radio 2 be paid for by ads rather than the licence fee? And online, does the BBC’s huge footprint on the internet undermine business opportunities that newspapers might like to exploit. The most important people in the debate are our audiences, our licence fee pairs, they are in a sense, our share holders. I hope their views, what they think about what to do is going to come to the fore in this debate. So is a root and branch review strictly necessary? The BBC has been unparalleled for so long, hasn’t it? It is probably time it changed a little. I have lived in America, Canada, CNN, Fox News, the BBC is hard to beat. They should abolish the licence because it is far too high and it is ridiculous considering we have so many channels on the television. The BBC plays a small part in that. A plan to decriminalise nonpayment of the TV licence has been shelved. But in the long-term the licence looks untenable. Instead, there may be payment by subscription or a household levy. The tone of today’s review is hardly hostile. But its questions go to the core of the BBC existence and the answers, expected in about three months, may decide its fate. Mark Easton, BBC News. In the past decade, 5,500 unaccompanied children have fled the violence in Afghanistan to reach the UK. Many have been allowed to stay in Britain for the time being and have been raised by foster families. But on reaching 18 they have to reapply for asylum and must return to Afghanistan if their case is rejected. In the past five years more than 600 of these young asylum-seekers have been deported, according to figures obtained from the government. Chris Rogers has been talking to some of the young people affected. OK, guys, would you like some floats? This man is a lifeguard in Birmingham, a local hero who has saved lives. He fled the conflict in Afghanistan alone, aged just 11, arriving in the UK an illegal immigrant. He has no idea what became of his parents. His British foster family are all he has now. But when he reached 18, he had to reapply for asylum or leave the UK. He lost his case and now faces deportation. It’s just so upsetting because it puts everything... You realise then, right, we’ve got a fight on. My life is here, built here, I built everything here. Somebody comes in and takes it from me, that’s not right. They will argue that they’ve looked after you as a child, they protected you, it’s time for you to go home. But the war is not over. Linda has fostered two child asylum seekers. One was deported two years ago. Faisal is next to go. I feel that they are pawns in this political process. Anybody who wants to get political gain can say, we have sent this many people back. Faisal is now on the move, relying on friends, trying to avoid being picked up by immigration officers. But the government says the system is fair. Where people establish a genuine need for protection or a well founded fear of persecution, refuge will be granted. Every month, child asylum seekers are deported here, to Kabul, despite the Foreign Office advising Britons against travel to Afghanistan. The military presence, be it armed police or the army, is a permanent reminder that this is a city on the edge, the Taliban can strike any time, anywhere. This road hasjust been closed and we’ve just heard that the parliament building has been attacked by the Taliban. EXPLOSION SCREAMING This 23-year-old arrived back to this, after living in north London for eight years. When we found him he had been in Kabuljust four days. I’m not happy here in this country. How am I going to make my life? I can’t go outside. I can’t be safe here. A UK government supported scheme offers help to deportees, but he says it’s no use to him. He wants to make the same journey back to Britain he made as a child. With mass unemployment, many choose to escape reality. Living among Kabul’s heroin addicts we find several former child asylum seekers from the UK. Ahmed lived in Manchester for eight years. I pray to God, help me to come out from this situation. Governments across Europe are grappling with migrants, but here the very reasons they left their homeland as a child sees many fleeing their country of birth yet again. And you can see more on that story on Our World on the BBC News Channel on Saturday and Sunday evening at 9:30pm. Eurozone ministers have agreed to give Greece a bridging loan of 7 billion euros to keep its finances afloat until a bailout is approved. The loan is expected to be confirmed on Friday by all EU member states. Banks in Greece are expected to open again on Monday after the European Central Bank agreed to increase emergency funding to Greece for the first time since it was frozen in june. The decisions were made after Greek MPs passed new austerity measures as part of a bailout deal. Also today, the Treasury said it had secured a legally-binding agreement to protect British taxpayers’ money if Greece fails to repay its debts. The Chancellor George Osborne said the guarantee would also apply to other EU countries that are not members of the single currency. President Obama has become the first serving president to visit a US federal prison. His trip to a facility in Oklahoma City is part of a drive to reform the country’s penal system. More than two million Americans are currently serving prison terms. Tim Farron has been elected to lead the Liberal Democrats, succeeding Nick Clegg, who resigned after the party’s worst-ever election result. Mr Farron, a former party president, defeated his fellow MP Norman Lamb. As Vicki Young reports, he now faces a daunting challenge to resurrect the party’s fortunes. Her report does contain some flash photography. He’sjust been handed one of the most daunting tasks in British politics. Tim Farron has to rebuild a shattered party. He never fully embraced Nick Clegg’s coalition with the Tories. Tonight, he told activists the comeback starts here. If you think it is wrong to demonise immigrants, the young, the poor, foreigners, Brussels, the English, the Scots, join us. If you are fed up of self-satisfied politicians, ambitious for themselves and unambitious for their country, then guess what? You are a Liberal. Embrace that diagnosis. It is an utterly decent and British condition. Tim Farron will be unknown to most voters but he’s been a Liberal activist for decades. This may be a small step for Liberals, it’s a giant step for Leyland. He first stood for Parliament in 1992, against Theresa May, then worked at a university before winning in the Lake District. In the coalition, he was never given a ministerialjob. Closer to Labour than the Conservatives, he voted against the controversial rise in tuition fees. As a committed Christian some think he failed to give wholehearted support to gay rights. Tim Farron says he wants to be a spiky leader who says things that get him noticed. His fans say he’ll inject some energy into a despondent party, but some senior figures have questioned hisjudgment. After the crushing election defeat which leftjust eight Lib Dem MPs, many think Mr Farron has the charisma to revive his party. He can be the high vis candidate. We know the Lib Dems will struggle to get noticed over the next five years. He’s a party leader who is based in the north, he is not off the conveyor belt special adviser turned MP. The weakness is whether or not he has the gravitas. So will it be enough to win back seats like Kingston in south-west London, once a Lib Dem stronghold? These new members, some of the 17,000 who have signed up since the election, are optimistic. We can be radical because we are small. We can start again in terms of our ideas. It’s as important as ever now to have a Liberal voice especially with the EU membership coming up. The challenge for Tim Farron is to convince voters that the Liberal Democrats are worth listening to. Golf- and the Americans Dustin johnson and Zach johnson are the clubhouse leaders on the first day of the Open at St Andrews. The highest-placed British player is the former champion Paul Lawrie, a shot behind. But Tiger Woods - who’s missed the cut in two of the last three majors - again struggled, as our correspondent Andy Swiss reports. The so-called home of golf has rarely seemed so inviting. A gentle breeze and a warm welcome. From the USA, jordan Spieth. At just 21, jordan Spieth is the favourite and aiming for history. A third major in a row and he’s perfectly placed, just two off the lead. Oh, you’re kidding me! But as his star rises another continues to fall. Tiger Woods now ranks just 241st in the world. I don’t believe it. And that set the tone for a round in which form and luck largely deserted him. At four over, surely so are his chances. Those looking for some British success though found Paul Lawrie, eventually. He’s somewhere behind that number 15. But from that rather unpromising position he conjured the shot of the day. Oh, my goodness! The 1999 champion just one off the lead, held by America’s Dustin johnson, one of many players to make the most of the calm conditions. After today’s good scoring though, tomorrow could be very different. With wind and rain forecast the Open challenge is about to get a whole lot tougher. Cricket - and Australia’s batsmen had some powerful responses to England’s bowlers on the first day of the second Ashes Test. Chris Rogers made an unbeaten 158 as the visitors piled on the pressure, finishing the day on 337-1. Our sports correspondent joe Wilson watched the play. The Lord’s pitch, polished to perfection by mortal man for Australia to bat on. Chris Rogers admitted he thought he was out when he played this shot in the first over. Ball eluded England, Rogers batted all day. Warner departed trying to hit Moeen Ali out of the ground, victim of his own ego. That was where the wickets stopped. As a Middlesex player for years, this was Rogers’ home ground. Only the supporters have changed. They’re Australian, at a guess. Steve Smith had made 50, when he provided this opportunity. Tough. Nothing in the conditions to help England, but how Australia made the best of it. The only tension became the race to reach a hundred. Steve Smith got there first. He’s the bright young thing. Chris Rogers is 37 years old, experienced enough to know a revival when he’s caused one. Australia finished 337-1. Hopefully Steve and I have made a bit of a statement and showed our changing room as much as anyone that we can get the upper hand on England. Yep, the tone has changed. Steve Smith said after play he was surprised England’s Australian coach had let them be so defensive today. ""We’d never do that,"" he added, pointedly. Handshakes at the close of play. Look forward to seeing you on Friday morning, when Smith and Rogers will still be batting. Here on BBC One it’s time for the news where you are. Good evening, I’m Asad Ahmad. We’re just hours away from tough new penalties coming into force for people carrying knives. Adults convicted of carrying a blade for a second time will be jailed for at least six months - while teenagers will get as least four months. And, for a mother who’s son was stabbed to death in North London - the change comes after five years of campaigning for tougher sentences. Here’s our Home Affairs Correspondent, Nick Beake. just one stab wound that went straight in his heart. Within a few minutes, Godwin had died. Ever since her son was murdered, Yvonne Lawson has visited schools across London to tell her story. And how I really wanted to be there to hold him, to comfort him... But now, five years on from that dark day, a massive victory for Yvonne. Tougher sentences on knife crime which she fought for have become a reality. I think it’s a fantastic incredible legacy in Godwin’s memory. I look at the fact that I lost a son, but we could actually use this legislation to save many, many lives in so many years to come. So what are the new measures that come into effect tomorrow? An adult caught carrying a knife for the second time will be given an automatic prison sentence of at least six months. For 16 and 17-year-olds, it’s a minimum four-month detention and training order. And the Ministry ofjustice estimates that over the coming year, it means more than 1,000 extra people will be sent to prison. Enfield is a borough which has felt the pain of knife crime deeply. The faces of local teenagers stabbed to death over the past seven years. It set one politician on a mission to drive tougher legislation through Parliament. ",,

The race is in its final minutes in central Paris - with Froome about to make British cycling history. Over 21 gruelling stages of the Tour he maintained a compelling lead - and faced accusations of cheating - we’ll be live in Paris. Also this evening. A Deputy Speaker of the House of Lords resigns after being caught on camera apparently taking cocaine. Alex Salmond suggests another Scottish independence referendum is 'inevitable’ - accusing the government of failing to deliver on further devolution. And in Hungary Formula 1 pays tribute to driver jules Bianchi, who died earlier this month. Good evening. The cyclist Chris Froome has all but won this year’s Tour de France - and made it into the history books in the process. He’s expected to cross the finishing line on the Champs-Elysees shortly - but his lead over the punishing stages of cycling’s most prestigious road race - and the risk of accidents in the heavy rain - meant organisers stopped the clock and declared he just had to finish to win. Victory would make him the first Briton to win the Tour for a second time. Let’sjoin our Sports Editor Dan Roan on the Champs Elysee. Chris Froome has been on what is, in effect, a lap of honour for the last few minutes but very shortly his coronation will be complete. He will be declared the Tour de France winner. A day of celebration and but also for the sport, reflection, on one of the most turbulent and ten ‘s Tour de France races in recent years. It wasn’tjust Tour de France races in recent years. It wasn’t just the weather that gave Paris a British Field Day. For the third time in four years the world’s most famous bicycle race had a British winner. Chris Froome finally able to relax ahead of today’s last stage and savour his historic achievement. There’sjust historic achievement. There’s just so historic achievement. There’sjust so much to processing in the moment, obviously, so many emotions riding on the Champs-Elysees where you’ve just got these massive crowds, hopefully the weather want to take away from that at all. Those competing for the yellowjersey, competing for the yellow jersey, tradition competing for the yellowjersey, tradition dictates that the final stage today is nothing more than a ceremonial procession into the centre of Paris. But if fans coming here in their numbers to witness a piece of sporting history. What do you think of it as an achievement, is he now in the top elite band of British boss people? I think so and I hope he gets a knighthood like Bradley Wiggins did. We aren’tjust sheer, we are here for the guy who writes the longest and the best, Chris Froome, good luck to him. Chris Froome has arrived in the centre of Paris and soon he will do what no other British cyclist has ever done before, when a second Tour de France. Such has been his dominance these past three weeks, he and his Team Sky team-mates have been forced to deny continued suspicions of doping from some sections of the sceptical French media, amid unprecedented levels of animosity has been spat at and had allegations of abuse and even had you been thrown at him. The manager out of the sport said the winner deserved better. The behaviour of a few individuals on the roadside is regrettable. Frankly it is despicable. No one should have to face that. Athletes deserve respect when going about their business, whatever country, whatever nation, whatever individual. Chris Froome wins having set a new standard of successful British cycling. Mild mannered and polite off his bike, he has shown a steely determination to prevail and maybe now we’ll become more appreciated by a British sporting public who have been slow to take him to their hearts. His triumph one that has tested him and his character in every possible way. Dan, such a tough gruelling ways to win -- Dan, such a tough gruelling ways to win -- race to win once, let alone twice. Remarkable to think that five years ago Britain had never had a Tour de France winner and now it is official, Chris Froome has indeed won, in the last few moments come ye has crossed the line and officially been declared the winner of the 2015 Tour de France. In doing so, I think he enters British sporting aristocracy. Uncharted territory for any British rider, but he would not be blamed for being relieved as well as delighted that it is all over. Never before, perhaps, has a champion cyclist been under such scrutiny. Why? The Lance Armstrong legacy lives on. I think many of the sceptics were not happy with just how dominant Chris Froome has been and how dominant his team has been. He reminded them of Lance Armstrong’s team and as a result of that, whoever wins this most gruelling of events will not do so without some suspicion. That’s unfortunate for Chris Froome, all he can do is keep winning and help that one day his achievements are taken at face value. Dam, on the Champs-Elysees at the end of the Tour de France, thank you. A senior member of the House of Lords - Lord Sewel - has resigned as a deputy Speaker after the Sun on Sunday newspaper published a video of him apparently taking drugs with prostitutes. Lord Sewel had been responsible for enforcing standards in the House of Lords. Here’s our Home Affairs Correspondentjune Kelly. Lord Sewel, a senior figure in Parliament, although not a household name. Now he is infamous. I beg to move the first motion standing in mining on the order paper... This was the married peer and former Labour Party minister in the House of Lords ten days ago, a deputy Speaker and head of the standards of conduct committee, not any more, he resigned today after a tabloid released footage of him allegedly snorting cocaine with prostitutes. He is asked about parliamentary allowances. Bad news for Parliament, bad news for the House of Lords but he needs to go. Notjust resigning his position. He needs to resign, retired from the House of Lords, and do so straightaway. As a man with responsibility for standards in the House of Lords, he recently wrote this. In the video which has been his undoing he makes racist and sexist remarks about Asian women. The revelations were described as"" shocking and unacceptable"" by the Speaker of the House of Lords, who said this. In the video Lord Sewel reportedly says he wants to be letters stray. Even now moves from the front bench to the bill and the wilderness, and an investigation by Scotland Yard -- wilderness, and an investigation by Scotland Yard -- he wants to be led astray. Scotland’s former First Minister, Alex Salmond, has said a second independence referendum is ""inevitable"". Mr Salmond, who is now a Westminster MP, accused the government of failing to deliver on its promises on devolution. He said the timing of such a vote was in the hands of the current First Minister, and SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon. Our Political Correspondent Alex Forsyth reports. The day after Scotland has said no to independence disappointment among some was playing. They had lost a vote which the then First Minister said was not likely to be repeated any time soon. This is a once in a generation, perhaps even a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Scotland. But less than one year later, Alex Salmond, now an MP, has a different view. I think a second referendum is inevitable. The question is not the inevitability, it’s the timing. He said three things could encourage another referendum, new ScottishPower ‘s weren’t being delivered in full, there was a risk Scotland could be dragged out of the EU if the UK voted to leave and he blamed the UK Government’s welfare reforms and austerity. Instead of getting the vote to the max we are getting austerity to the max. That diverted to offer what is right in social terms between Scotland and England is another issue that is moving things to was another referendum. But it’s up to this woman if the SNP will campaign for another independence vote in the Scottish elections next year. So far Nicola Sturgeon has said her body isn’t planning that but it cannot be ruled out indefinitely, and timing is crucial. I don’t think a referendum will solve problems, it will create more problems. Bad idea. We’ve been there, done it, we voted no. The situation has changed since the last referendum. I think it will be inevitable. Lunch mag the SNP’s political opponents say revisiting theissue political opponents say revisiting the issue is the wrong priority. It would seem to me that the people of Scotland would want the former First Minister to concentrate on big issues in Scotland that they have control over but it seems they are obsessed with finding an excuse for a second referendum that Scottish people said loudly last year that they wanted to stay part of the UK. In Westminster Conservative sources say talk of a second referendum which Alex Simon has mentioned before is a distraction from how the SNP would use new powers it’s getting from the UK Parliament. They feel is that the independence question was settled decisively last year but as debate rages over devolution from Westminster to the rest of the UK, it is inevitable that so too will debate over the future of the Union. Although any second referendum would be some way off. The Labour leadership candidate, jeremy Corbyn, has played down suggestions that thousands of people who don’t support the party are trying to skew the contest in his favour. Two Labour MPs have called for the election to be halted because they fear large numbers of those registering to take part are trying to distort the outcome. The M20 motorway in Kent has re-opened to all traffic in both directions after the end of Operation Stack, which closed parts of it to cars. The police operation, which involved lorries bound for the Channel Tunnel being parked on the motorway, was brought in because of migrant activity and industrial action in France. Eurotunnel services have now returned to normal, but one ferry operator has suspended services from Dover due to more disruption in Calais. President Obama has arrived in Ethiopia on the second stage of his African tour. Before leaving Kenya he praised its economic and political advances, but also warned of challenges ahead. Speaking to an audience of thousands in Nairobi, he said his father’s homeland had gone a long way in his lifetime. Our Africa correspondent Alistair Leithead reports. There’s been no lack of enthusiasm over President Obama’s homecoming, as they call it here. Inspiring young people was an aim of his visit. A rock star welcome at the sports stadium in Nairobi. And a hug for his half-sister, who introduced him. After the terror attacks which have torn into Kenya’s reputation, they needed this. Kenya is on the move. Africa is on the move. You are poised to play a bigger role in this world as the shadows of the past are replaced by the light that you offer. We have to see that we are connected, ourfates are bound together, because in the end we are all part of one tribe. The human tribe. In the village where his father is buried they have been celebrating all week, making preparations for his visit. But he didn’t come - too much else to do. Next time he comes he will be former President Obama. He’s made a commitment to keep his ties to Africa, and especially Kenya. But family members did join him in Nairobi. At the state dinner last night he had every appearance of a man thoroughly enjoying his trip, despite the tough talking. Too often here in Kenya, as is true in other places, corruption is tolerated because that is how things have always been done. And ordinary people have to stand up and say enough is enough. It is time for a better future. We have what it takes to be where we want to be. We love him so much. African people may not see the importance of this now but they can see it in the future. For all of the Kenyans and all of the Africans it is time to get together. All our problems are the same and we solve them all from one point. You can feel the energy the president has brought with him to Kenya. It is clearly a place he will spend more time in the future. He wants an Africa built on business, not hand-outs, investing in young people who will soon make up half the population of this continent. That is the message he will take with him as he leaves for Ethiopia and the next leg of his trip. With all the sport, here’s Olly Foster at the BBC Sport Centre.

For those competing for the yellowjersey, competing for the yellow jersey, tradition competing for the yellowjersey, tradition dictates that today’s final stage is nothing more than a ceremonial procession into the centre of Paris. The weather not the only thing giving the city a distinctive British flavour. What do you think of it off as an achievement, is Froome in that top elite band of British sports people? I think he is and I hope you get a knighthood like Bradley Wiggins did. We are here for the guy who writes the longest in the best COPY who writes the longest in the best copyis who writes the longest in the best copy is Chris Froome. Good luck to him. One of the top sportsmen we have had, he is a -- him. One of the top sportsmen we have had, he is a -- it is a well-deserved win. Chris Froome has arrived here in the centre of Paris, and soon he will do what no other British rider has done before, when a second Tour de France. Such has been Froome’s dominance, he and Team Sky have been forced to deny continued suspicions of doping from some sections of a sceptical French media. Amid acrimony and innuendo, the president of the International cycling union told me he deserved better. Frankly, it is despicable, nobody should have to face that, and I think athletes deserve respect when they are going about their business, whatever you as an individual think about them. With the title all but secured yesterday, this was effectively an extended lap of honour. All Froome needed to do was complete the stage. The formalities over, the yellowjersey was his again. It hasjust been formalities over, the yellowjersey was his again. It has just been from one a motion to another, especially from the end of yesterday’s stage, just getting here today, it is almost a blur at this point. Tonight, Froome secured his place as the only British cyclist to win a second Tour de France. Mild-mannered and polite off his bike, he has shown a steely determination to prevail. This, a triumph that has tested him and his character in every possible way. How much of a moment is this for British cycling, and for British sport? Let’s put this into context, Michelle. Five years ago, Britain had never had a Tour de France winner. Now Chris Froome has won its not once, but twice, and in doing so he enters an elite band of sporting aristocracy. He had to do it under unprecedented levels of scrutiny. This was surely one of the most poisonous Tour de Frances in recent years. He had notjust accusations and abuse thrown at him by spectators on the roadside around France, his integrity was called into question, he was spat at on two consecutive stages. His team, Team Sky, tried to prove his innocence by releasing physiological data, they went to that extent. But for some, it was not good enough. Something it is down to jealousy, after all, France had not had a Tour de France winnerfor 30 years. For some sceptics, the level of dominance reminded them of the Lance Armstrong is. All Froome can do is keep winning and hope that one day his achievements are taken at face value. The British sporting public have been slow to take them to their hearts -- have been slow to take them to their hearts -- him to their heart until now. Perhaps they will. A deputy speaker of the House of Lords has resigned after being filmed apparently snorting cocaine with prostitutes. Lord Sewel, who’s not affiliated to any party, has also stepped down as chairman of the Lords privileges and conduct committee. The Speaker of the Lords, Lady D’Souza, says she’s asking Scotland Yard to investigate. Here’s our Home Affairs Correspondent, june Kelly. Lord Sewel, a senior figure in Parliament, although not a household name. Now he is notorious. I beg to move the first motion... This was the married pier and former Labour minister in the Lords ten days ago. He was a deputy speaker and head of the Lords conduct committee. Not any more. He resigned today after this front page appeared, showing him allegedly snorting cocaine with prostitutes. It was part of a video released by the Sun newspaper. He is asked about Parliamentary allowances. It is bad news for Parliament, bad news for the House of Lords, but he needs to go. Notjust resigning his position, he needs to resign, retire from the House of Lords and do so straightaway. As a man with responsibility for standards in the Lords, he recently wrotezz In the video which has been his undoing, Lord Sewel makes racist and sexist remarks about Asian women. The Speaker of the House of Lords responded swiftly to the revelations, describing Lord Sewel’s behaviour is both shocking and unacceptable. She said these serious allegations, as she described them, would now be referred to the House of Lords commission of standards and the Metropolitan Police Service to in the video, Lord Sewel reportedly says he wants to be led astray. He now moves from the front bench to the political wilderness, and an investigation by Scotland Yard. Turkey has called a meeting of Nato ambassadors to discuss its security concerns, after launching air strikes against both Kurdish separatists -- and so-called Islamic State fighters. Turkey began a peace process with the Kurds three years ago but there are fears the conflict will escalate - at a time of instability across the region. Mark Lowen reports from Istanbul. What’s left of a Turkish military vehicle, the latest attack by Kurdish separatists, the PKK. The bomb killed two and wounded four. In a growing wave of attacks, a dangerous triangle has opened up here between Turkey, the PKK and so-called Islamic State, all seemingly fighting each other. Now Turkey has called a meeting of Nato ambassadors on Tuesday to discuss the threat posed by both IS and the PKK. Talking to the BBC, Nato’s Secretary General encouraged a return to the recent peace process with the Kurdish separatists. We are helping them, supporting them, in their efforts to fight terrorism, but, of course, self-defence has to be proportionate. So, how did we get to this point? It comes after a violent few days, with claims and counterclaims. Last Monday, 32 people were killed by a suicide bomb in Kurdish majority Suruc, in southern Turkey. Turkey blamed Islamic State, but the Kurds claim the Turkish government has collaborated with the jihadist group. Two days later, the Kurdish PKK killed two Turkish policemen in retaliation for the Suruc attack. Then, over the weekend, Turkey launched air strikes against both IS and PKK positions, as well as arresting hundreds of their suspected members. Peace rallies were held today, amid fears that Turkey’s ceasefire with the PKK could be over, and that it is sliding back towards armed conflict with the Kurds. 40,000 were killed in the three decades’ long insurgency. The wounds are still raw. The government is trying to do... it is starting a war between Kurdish people and Turkish people again, like a civil war again, but we don’t want to have a war again, and this country has suffered enough of this war, and we won’t let it. Their message to all sides is to stop a return to violence, to pull Turkey back from the brink, because if this country is embroiled in its own civil conflict, it would complicate immeasurably the role it can play against IS, and therefore the entire coalition strategy against the jihadists. Elsewhere, the protests were more violent, as Kurds hit out against the Turkish government. This is a critical moment for the fight against Islamic State, and for the stability of Turkey itself. Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, has acknowledged that his forces have lost ground in the ongoing civil war because of a lack of manpower. In his first public address in a year, President Assad said that more than four years of conflict had forced his troops to give up some territory, in order to hold on to areas of greater strategic importance. Scotland’s former First Minister, Alex Salmond, has said a second independence referendum is ""inevitable"". Mr Salmond said the timing of such a vote was in the hands of the current First Minister, and SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon. Our Political Correspondent, Alex Forsyth, explains. The day after Scotland said no to independence. Disappointment among some was plain. They had lost a vote that the then First Minister had said was unlikely to be repeated any time soon. This is a once in a generation, perhaps even a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Scotland. But less than a year later, and Alex Salmond, now an MP, has a different view. I think I said and independence referendum is inevitable, the question is the timing of it. Mr Salmond said three things could influence a referendum. He blamed the UK Government’s welfare reforms and austerity. We are getting austerity to the max. That diverging view of what is right in social terms between Scotland and England is another issue, which is moving things towards another referendum. But it is up to this woman whether the SNP will campaign for another independence vote in next year’s Scottish elections. So far, Nicola Sturgeon has said her party is not planning that, but it can’t be ruled out indefinitely. The Scottish people will decide the timing, says the SNP, and for some in Glasgow today, that’s crucial. I think in the next five years we will get another chance to vote and it is time to stop being a shadow. People are yes and no, I don’t think Scotland is ready for it at this stage. The SNP’s political opponents said revisiting the issue is the wrong priority. It would seem to me that the people of Scotland want the First Minister to be concentrating on those issues in Scotland they have full control over but it seems they are completely obsessed with trying to find a second referendum. In Westminster, Conservative sources said talk of a second referendum, which Alex Salmond has mentioned before, is a distraction from how the SNP would use new powers it is getting from the UK Parliament. The government’s view is the independence question was settled decisively last year. So any second referendum would be some way off, but as UK devolution is debated, and Westminster’s role in Scottish and English matters, so too will be the future of the union. President Obama has ended his trip to Kenya by urging its people to confront corruption and overcome tribal and ethnic divisions. Addressing an audience of thousands at a sports stadium in Nairobi, Mr Obama said Kenya was at a crossroads, with the future holding both peril and enormous promise. Our Africa Correspondent, Alastair Leithead, was there, and sent this report. There has been no lack of enthusiasm over President Obama’s homecoming, as they call it here, inspiring young people was an aim of his visit. A rock star welcome at the sports stadium in Nairobi, and a hug for his half sister, who introduced him. After the terror attacks that have torn into Kenya’s reputation, they needed this. Kenya is on the move. Africa is on the move. You are poised to play a bigger role. In this world come of the past are replaced by the light that you offer, we have to see that we are connected, ourfates offer, we have to see that we are connected, our fates are connected, ourfates are bound together. Because, in the end, we are all part of one tribe, the human tribe. In the village where his father is buried, they have been celebrating all week and making preparations for his visit, but he didn’t come. Too much else to do. Next time, he will be former President Obama. He has made a commitment to keep his ties to Africa and especially Kenya. But family members didjoin Africa and especially Kenya. But family members did join him in Nairobi. At the state dinner last night, he had every appearance of a man thoroughly enjoying his trip, despite the tough talking. Around the world, there is a tradition of repressing women, and treating them differently, and not giving them the same opportunities, and husbands beating their wives, and children not being sent to school. Those are traditions, treating women and girls as second class traditions. Those are bad traditions. They need to change. To be what we want to be, and we love them so much. African people may not see the importance of this now but they can see it in the future. Forallthe this now but they can see it in the future. For all the canyons and Africans, it is time to get together, all of our problems are the same and we say all them from one point. You can feel the energy the President has brought to Kenya. He wants and Africa built on business not hand-outs, investing in young people who will soon make up half the population of this continent. That is the message she will take with him as he leaves for Ethiopian, and the next leg of his trip. British troops are taking part in military exercises in the west of Ukraine this week, as part of a major exercise run by American and Ukrainian forces. Washington insists it is not a direct response to the conflict in eastern Ukraine, but Moscow has called it a ""provocation"". Meanwhile, the fighting shows no sign of abating. Our correspondent Tom Burridge, and cameraman Stuart Antrobus, have spent much of the past two weeks in eastern Ukraine, and sent this report. Ina region In a region torn apart by conflict, the summer takes innocent minds off the wall. To a performance of a Russian fairy tale. A world away -- off the wall. A world away from real-life nightmares. This girl is 14. TRANSLATION: My friend, he and his friends from the area went to the school to play football. A shell landed, and he was killed by shrapnel.

You really get a sense of how we are within touching distance really of the airport there. Basically, Ukrainian army positions, and basically every night this begins. Booms, artillery, mortars across this area of the front line, it is a real hotspot. There you go again. The monotony of the fighting this spring and summer filmed at times by the troops we were with means much of the world has forgotten this war. But Ukraine, whose troops are carrying out training exercises with US forces, continually warns of a fresh rebel offensive. Moscow says America, Britain and other Nato countries, training together in the west of Ukraine, is a provocation. America says it is about supporting a sovereign and independent Ukraine. This is not about Russia, it is about Ukraine, Ukrainian territory, helping Ukrainians to develop their capacity to defend what belongs to them. A realand capacity to defend what belongs to them. A real and deadly routine rings out in the east of Ukraine every day. In six months, nothing much has changed, but something will have to give. The persistent fear is that things could escalate again. Sebastian Vettel stormed to victory in the Hungarian Grand Prix today, dedicating his victory to fellow driver, jules Bianchi, who died nine days ago of injuries sustained in a crash last October. Despite starting on pole, Lewis Hamilton could only manage sixth, as Patrick Gearey reports. This is one of the busiest, noisiest places in sport, but for a minute the grid became a chapel. Fierce rivals United in remembering jules Bianchi, who died a week last Friday because of injury sustained at the japanese Grand Prix. He was 25. His fellow drivers had to remember and yet forget, somehow put risk to the back of their minds. Watch for examples of best in the on the right. Fed up of waiting behind the Mercedes in the queue. COMMENTATOR: Vettel trying to come around the outside of Lewis Hamilton! There began a race of mishaps for Hamilton, he took the wrong turn, went cross-country. Further ahead, we nt cross-country. Further ahead, Vettel went cross-country. Further ahead, Vettel had an open road. Among all the thrills, a graphic reminder of what can go wrong. Nico Hulkenberg’s front wing dropped. Thankfully he escaped uninjured. When the race restarted, Hamilton was again in trouble. This scrap with Daniel Ricciardo badly damaged his ambition. Yet he came back, darting pastjenson Button. Up the road, Nico Rosberg tyres punctured, so he finished in sixth. But this was about Vettel, and as the German recognised, about Bianchi.

And the call for football clubs to pay the entire bill for policing matches. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. The UK economy grew by 0.7% in the second three months of the year, helped by a strong increase in the service sector and a big jump in oil and gas production. The Office for National Statistics says GDP per head has now caught up with pre-crisis levels at the start of 2008. The Chancellor, George Osborne, welcomed the news, saying that Britain’s economy is motoring ahead. Labour warned against complacency. The news has brought heightened speculation about the timing of an interest rate rise. Our economics correspondent jonty Bloom reports. For this manufacturing company near Derby, plastics are the future. After a tough downturn, it is growing strongly, doubling sales and staff. It has reversed the pay cuts which helped it survive. The economy has improved for us. Most of our work is house refurbishment and double glazing. Going back four or five years ago, it was awful, but now it is picking up. At manufacturing overall has not done so well, as the high pound and weak eurozone have hit exports. The economy has grown by 0.70%, up from 0.4% in the first three months of the year. But manufacturing is still shrinking. Forthe the year. But manufacturing is still shrinking. For the Chancellor, visiting another manufacturer in Derbyshire this morning, this is still good news. This shows that Britain is motoring ahead, with our economy producing as much per person as ever before. But there are leer risks in the world economy, from the eurozone, to what is happening in the world stock markets. We have got to stay on the road that we set out on. I think the Chancellor needs to focus much more on getting healthier growth than this if we are to withstand international pressures. A balanced recovery would also focus on construction, which remains flat, and manufacturing, which is going backwards. The real growth is coming from the largest part of the economy, the services sector, which is booming, as is North Sea oil production, encouraged by tax breaks. Forthe production, encouraged by tax breaks. For the economy as a whole, this is probably as good as it gets. The UK is growing as well as any other developed economy, and it should be. If you cannot grow now, then when can you, with low inflation, low interest rates? It is not going to continue for ever. But the speed of growth raises the question of how long interest rates will stay at record low figures. The Bank of England will be examining these figures. It has said that its policy of keeping interest rates at ultralow levels will have to end some time soon. With growth accelerating again, that decision looks like it is getting closer. And jonty is here now. This figure looks good, but the Government has always wanted a more balanced economy, so is that what we are seeing? No, it is not. It is good news, of course, 0.70% growth. Over the next year, we are expecting overall growth by 2.5-3%. So this is probably the peak period of growth for the British economy. But as for the rebalancing, the opposite is happening. We have got massive growth in services. That means finance, business and sales, things like that. But if we look at manufacturing, it is still declining in size. It is still smaller than it was before the recession started in 2008. Construction, the same. Those attempts to rebalance the economy towards exporting, towards actually making things, have not worked. Speculation that an increase in interest rates will come sooner rather than later - interest rates will come sooner rather than later - good news for savers but worrying for people with mortgages? Yes, everybody wants to know when this will be. Today’s figures make it more likely that interest rates will go out sooner rather than later. We are seeing unemployment falling, wages rising. The Bank of England will be worrying about whether this means inflation will rise over the long-term, and therefore, should it act now to cut it off before it gets going? On the other side, we have got lower oil prices, commodity prices are falling, there are few inflationary factors in the pipeline which will really force up prices. So there is a dilemma for the Bank of England. Is it act now or does it wait to see if any inflation turns up? It would be bad news for people with mortgages, who have enjoyed very low interest rates, but good news for savers, who have had very little return for years now. Lord Sewel, the senior peer caught on camera apparently taking drugs with prostitutes, has bowed to pressure and resigned from the House of Lords. In a statement, he said he hoped his decision would ""limit and help repair"" the damage he had done to what he described as ""an institution I hold dear"". The police are investigating the allegations and have searched a flat in central London. Our political correspondent Robin Brant reports. This isjohn Sewel, in the footage which has led to his downfall. It has been three days, but now he has decided to step down and quit politics. In a brief statement, announcing his resignation, Lord Sewel said... That is not the end of it, though. There is still a police investigation to deal with. Lord Sewel in a London flat was raided by police yesterday, investigating illegal drug use. And what about the politics of this humiliating demise? There are big questions about how you deal with Lords who go off the rails. The Prime Minister signalled there will be no fresh attempt at bigger reforms of the House of Lords. I regret the fact we did not achieve House of Lords reform in the last Parliament. At it is quite clear to me that there is no point trying that route again. But things have changed over the last few years. They have got tougher with errant Lords. It is now possible to expel the worst offenders, and peers can now retire. But for some, that is not enough. The House of Lords needs change, it is too big, there are too many party politicians in there. At the same time it doesn’t a usefuljob of work there. At the same time it doesn’t a useful job of work for the country, in stopping the Commons from rushing things through. I think generally that at the end of the day we will conclude we should go on having something a bit like what we have got. Lord Sewel does not get to walk through this lobby any more or take part in votes. But he will be able to use some of the facilities here now and then, and he remains a Lord, a title which only the Queen can take away from him. Oddities like that only serve to highlight the bigger failings which some believe need changing here. Well, Norman Smith is at Westminster. So, is this the end of the matter? Many peers will be hoping it is. You can almost hear the sighs of relief behind me, because of fears that this episode would renew calls for another shake-up of the House of Lords. That is one of the reasons Lord Sewel said he was standing down, because he did not want to undermine confidence in the place. But he was under massive pressure to go. He was not quite pushed out the door, but there were plenty of people nudging him towards it. They were furious at his contemptuous remarks about them, suggesting that they were all rogues and thieves, many of them not worth the £300 a day allowance they can claim. The Leader of the House of Lords said that quite rigorous pressure,"", have been placed on him to quit. I suspect it will be carry on as usual now. David Cameron has ruled out any further fundamental reforms of the upper chamber. He will press ahead with appointing more peers to a chamber which is already the largest in the world, with the exception of the Chinese People’s Congress. I suspect those people who want it to be business as usual in the House of Lords will think that Lord Sewel resigned in the nick of time. A public inquiry into undercover policing in England and Wales opened this morning. It follows last year’s damning review into corruption which contained claims a police ""spy"" had infiltrated the family ""camp"" of the murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence. The inquiry will look at all undercover policing since the Met Police’s undercover police unit, the Special Demonstration Squad, was set up in 1968. june Kelly reports. It was the involvement of undercover officers in political protest groups which exposed the scale of secret policing. Questions have been raised specifically about a now disbanded Scotland Yard unit. It will be under scrutiny in this wide-ranging inquiry, which will hear from former SDS officers. I was a grown adult when I did the work and I actually felt that what I was doing was correct. The benefit of hindsight means I should never have ever gone anywhere near that sort of work. It emerged that through their infiltration, officers had gathered evidence onjustice groups and grieving families. Like that of the murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence. From his father today, some reservations about how the inquiry will be run. It isa It is a judge-led inquiry, butjust one person sitting down to decide. I would rather it was more than one person. If it is going to bejust one person, I would rather we had a iury one person, I would rather we had a jury panel when the time came for decisions to be made. Lord justice Pitchford, who will head the inquiry, announced it will examine the role of the government in police activities, the targeting of individuals for political views, and possible miscarriages ofjustice. This relates to convictions secured through undercover policing. Some officers had relationships with activists. Helen Steel as one of the women who did not realise the man she was living with, who suddenly disappeared, was a police spy. The police have been hiding the truth about what has been going on by claiming that they can neither confirm or deny anything, including the names of the officers. If this inquiry is to achieve anything, the truth has to come out. The inquiry will examine all forms of undercover policing and so will stretch beyond protest groups to secret policing in serious crime. Officers who testify may be given a guarantee that evidence will not be used against them in any criminal proceedings. David Cameron has promised a crackdown on criminals who hide stolen or laundered money by buying luxury properties in Britain. In a speech in Singapore, the Prime Minister declared there is no place in the UK for what he called ""dirty money"". We are one of the most open and welcoming economies anywhere in the world. But I want to ensure all this money is clean money. There is no place for dirty money in Britain. Indeed, there should be no place for dirty money anywhere. That is my message to foreign fraudsters. London is not a place to stash your dodgy cash. It may be your ""final will and testament"", but a landmark Court of Appeal ruling has dealt a major blow to the rights of people to choose who they want to leave money to when they die. Heather Ilott has been awarded £164,000 from the estate of her mother, Melita jackson, even though her will made it plain her estranged daughter was to be disinherited. More details from our legal correspondent Clive Coleman. When people make a will, they expect their wishes to be carried out. It does not always happen. Heather Ilott did not get on with her mother, Melita jackson. When she died in 2004, she made it crystal clear she did not want her daughter to benefit, and left her estate to animal charities with which she had little connection. The relationship between mother and daughter had soured decades earlier, when the 17-year-old Heather Ilott eloped with the man who remains her husband. Yesterday, the Court of Appeal awarded Heather Ilott the third of her mother’s estate because she had not left reasonable financial provision for her daughter in the wheel. She will now be able to buy her housing association property and will not lose her state benefits. -- property and will not lose her state benefits. -- in the will. Before this, children cutout of a will would only be given money by a judge if they could show they were financially maintained by the deceased, generally meaning younger children. But under this ruling, aduh children. But under this ruling, adult children have a much better chance of claiming through the courts. Lawyers say the ruling means people can still leave their children out of their will. People will still try to do it, and some people do it quite successfully, for whatever reason. Those cases we do not hear about. But for those wanting to do it, they need to be very clear about why they are doing it, and they need to see their solicitor to document the reasons. Charities which have been left money, like the RSPCA, who benefited in this case, are concerned. Without the legacy income, we are reliant for 50% of the animals we protect, we are reliant on that income. That for us is the danger. We are very grateful to everybody who gets their money to us, and we hope they will continue to do so in the future. This case means those who want their money to go to charity, and not their children, will need to explain clearly in their will why they are doing it, and show they have a real connection with the charity. Even then, the will could be challenged. Our top story, there has been a sharp acceleration in economic growth helped by a big increase in oil and gas production. Still to come, celebrating in style, the world ‘s oldest panda in captivity is 37 today. On BBC London, a Victorian musical built 150 years ago is given a new lease of life to host contemporary entertainment. After heavy rain at the weekend, have things started to settle again? NATO’s Secretary General, jens Stoltenberg, has said that the military alliance stands in strong solidarity with its ally Turkey, which in the past week has launched air attacks on the group known as Islamic State and on Kurdish separatist fighters. Mr Stoltenberg was speaking in Brussels at the opening of an emergency meeting requested by the Turkish government. Our defence correspondent jonathan Beale is in Brussels. jonathan. Turkey called this emergency meeting not for Nato’s military support, after all Turkey already has the second-largest in Nato. But it wanted a show of political support and solidarity from its allies following those air strikes against Islamic State targets, but also against the Kurdish separatist group, the PKK. And that is exactly what Turkey got. After largely standing on the sidelines, Turkey has nowjoined the fight against Islamic State. For the first time its warplanes have hit the group also known as Daesh in neighbouring Syria. But it has also been targeting an old enemy, the Kurdish separatist group the PKK. The complication is that PKK has been helping in the fight against Daesh. While most see a difference, Turkey does not. How can you say that this terrorist organisation is better because it is fighting Daesh? They are the same, terrorists are evil, they all must be eradicated. This is what we want. Today’s emergency meeting at Nato headquarters was called by Turkey under Article Four, when a member state feels its own security is threatened. Turkey has recently suffered attacks on its soil by both Islamic State and the PKK. The Nato Secretary General concluded the short meeting by saying Nato supported Turkey’s actions. All allies stand in solidarity with Turkey. We strongly condemn the terrorist attacks. Turkey’s attacks on the PKK could muddy the waters. There have already been violent demonstrations in Turkey. In targeting the PKK, allied to Iraqi and Syrian Kurds, there is a fear it could undermine the fight against Islamic State. It is the US, not Nato, that is leading the fight against Daesh. America appears to have already reached an agreement with Turkey to use one of its airbases to mount attacks against extremists. Washington and Ankara are also talking about plans to set up a buffer zone inside northern Syria to push out the Islamic extremists. Nato says it is not involved in those negotiations. Well, I’m told that in those discussions neither the US ambassador nor the Turkish ambassador would give any details about how this buffer zone in northern Syria will work. It’s meant to be 60 miles wide, 30 miles deep. Also interesting that the Secretary General, when condemning those terrorist attacks, he made no specific mention of the PKK. I’m told that a number of allies made very clear to Turkey that any attacks on PKK, Kurdish separatists, should be proportionate. And that’s not a word they are using when it comes to Islamic State. Colonel Gaddafi’s son Saif and eight others have been sentenced to death over war crimes linked to the 2011 Libya revolution. They were on trial along with dozens of other close associates of the deposed leader, accused of suppressing protests during the uprising. Saif gave evidence via video link as he is being held by a former rebel group from the town of Zintan that refuses to release him. Let’s speak to World Affairs editor john Simpson who’s in Tripoli. Can you explain what happened today? We know that only 29 of the defendants out of an original 38 were president in that court in Shipperley -- were present. Nine of them received death sentences by firing squad, including Colonel Gaddafi’s son, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi. As well as his former chief of intelligence. Both of these men were also wanted by the ICC, the international criminal courts, for alleged war crimes as well, but the Libyan government never handed them overfor Libyan government never handed them over for that trial and decided to try them at home. We also know that at least four of the defendants were set free, including the former Minister of foreign affairs, and the other defendants got a wide range of different sentences. Some got five years, others gotten years including fines. Now, the men who were sentenced to death today were accused of various things, including ordering the death or rather the killings of protesters during the 2011 uprising against Colonel Gaddafi. Also hiring mercenaries. And financial corruption. Thank you very much. The chairman of an inquiry into the murder of Alexander Litvinenko has accused a former Russian army officer, suspected of helping to poison the former agent, of trying to undermine the investigation. Dmitry Kovtun had been given an extended deadline of 9am this morning to get permission from the Russian authorities for him to give evidence by video link from Moscow. Let’s speak to our security correspondent Gordon Corera. And Gordon, considerable anger in court over what’s going on? Yes, this was Dmitry Kovtun’s last chance, really, to give evidence this morning. The enquiry cut to the video link to Moscow and instead of Dmitry Kovtun, there was an empty chair where he was supposed to be. He, of course, has been saying that he is prevented from giving evidence because there’s a danger he would breach confidentiality with Russian investigations. But there is a lot of scepticism about that here in London. The chairman of the enquiry, Sir Robert Owen, said it was possible this was all a Sharad and that he never intended at all to give evidence. Or that he might have been stopped from doing so. So instead all we got this morning was written evidence from Mr Kovtun, some of his previous interview transcripts being read out to the enquiry in which, for instance, you talked about that crucial meeting at the Pine bar of the millennium hotel -- he talked about. All of the evidence so far has pointed to Mr Kovtun and another man having poisoned Alexander Litvinenko with a cup of tea. But his written evidence showed his side of the story in which he said instead that Alexander Litvinenko had turned up and drank a couple of cups of tea on his own without being pressured to do so and had appeared ill already. But as I said, that was written evidence from previous interviews because Mr Kovtun was not there at the end of the video link as the enquiry had hoped for. So instead, by the end of this week, we will move to closing arguments and speeches by the lawyers. Although the final report is not expected until the end of the year. Thank you very much. The Hillsborough inquest has been hearing evidence from Stevenjones, whose wife Christine died in the tragedy. Mrjones, who was with Christine at the game, told the inquest that he has always been bothered that he didn’t help others because he was so obsessed with finding her. Our correspondent, judith Morritz, is at the inquest. Another difficult day? Very much so. We heard that the couple, Christine and Stephenjones had been married forfour and Stephenjones had been married for four years when they went together as man and wife watched the team they adored, Liverpool, play in the FA Cup semifinal at Hillsborough in April 1989. And Stephenjones came here to Warrington, to the Hillsborough inquest today, to give evidence about that. And he said that he’d stood with his wife Christine on the terraces, they felt the crushed developing around them, said it felt like a vice was being tightened. But they’d remain signed by side until there was a surge in the crowd which pushed them forward and forced them apart. Then he said he was lifted off his feet and he couldn’t even turn his head to see Christine, he lost sight of her. He said once the crash had eased he tried to find his wife and he couldn’t. He said ""I scoured the terraces, there were bodies to or 3-D, but I couldn’t find Christine"". He told the court he’d had training in first aid and that it had always bothered him he did not stop to how other people because he was so obsessed with trying to find his wife. At one point he said he went to ask a police officer where casualties had been taken, he was told in response, wherever they have been taken, they don’t want the likes of you there. He said he eventually found Christine Lagarde on the pitch. He said he knew instinctively at that moment his wife had died -- eventually found Christine laid out on the pitch. A team of experts have stepped up their efforts to try and stop the decline of one of Britain’s rarest ducks. just 35 pairs of the Common Scoter now breed in the UK each year- mostly by lochs in the highlands of Scotland. The Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust is now tagging them to try and find out why they’re in decline. Our science correspondent Victoria Gill has been out with one of the teams. Their name might suggest otherwise, but common scoter ducklings are a rare sight in this country. And their already tiny population is continuing to decline. So, a small team of researchers is spending the summer in this remote area of the Highlands to find out how they might be able to help one of our most threatened birds. There are only 35 breeding pairs of common scoters in the whole of Britain, most of which are nesting next to Highland lochs like this one. The team is going to fit six of them with these tiny tracking devices, but first they will have to catch them. And that is a military operation. The team has been studying the birds here since last summer, so they know exactly where the nests are, but to catch the females requires a stealthy pincer movement. As two of the team move in with a large net, another sneaks in to flush the bird. In the back of the net. Once the slightly dazed duck has been retrieved the team get to work, weighing, measuring and taking DNA samples. Like a trip to the dentist. The annual check-up. Crucially handling the ducks means the researchers can retrieve miniature tracking devices they fitted to the birds last year and fit new tags to track the unknown path of their winter migration. These geo-locaters that we have just fitted and retrieved from last year will hopefully show us for the first time where UK breeding scoters spend the winter. Then after as brief and minor an ordeal as possible it is time to let her go. You get a real sense of connection to these birds. If we can do anything small to make their lives a little bit easier, or to help them produce more young, that will be a really valuable bit of conservation. By following the fortunes of each of these birds the team is also looking for clues about what is changing in this apparently idyllic habitat and how they might help protect it for its wildlife. Victoria Gill, BBC News. The world’s oldest giant panda, jia jia, is celebrating her 37th birthday. It may not be considered a landmark birthday for humans, but turning 37 makes her the oldest-ever giant panda in captivity. She was born in the wild in 1978 before being adopted by the Ocean Park Zoo in Hong Kong. Her keepers say it’s the equivalent of a human reaching 100, as most pandas only live to their twenties. ~ I hope she’s not planning a holiday here. With the weather details, Matt Taylor. Probably not. The path of a British summer never runs smoothly. Take this very dayjust ten years ago, one of the strongest Tornados ever recorded in the UK left a scar seven miles long around the suburbs of Birmingham. Around a month ago we had the highestjuly Birmingham. Around a month ago we had the highest july temperatures on record, 37 degrees. This was yesterday in Cumbria. It is not the bad weather, it is the wrong choice of clothing, a cold and wet day. The same weather front is still in charge across parts of central and southern Scotland, increasingly Northern southern Scotland, increasingly Northern Ireland through this afternoon and the far north of England. Lightness to the north but a better chance of seeing sunshine to the south. Keen westerly breeze, one or two showers to the south. Most will stay dry as we go into the evening. Some showers further north that we are already seeing are starting to get heavier with the rumble of thunder with it, North Wales, North Midlands. Some sunshine between showers. The far north of England, Northern Ireland and Scotland and still the rain continues to fall with some heavy bursts mixed in. Further north, one or two showers and at least a little bit of sunshine. Cool across-the-board, temperatures 12 to across-the- board, temperatures 12 to 20 across-the-board, temperatures 12 to 20 degrees. The weather front shifts further southwards and fragments, it means showers are possible just about anywhere overnight, with temperatures ten or 11 degrees. As the weather front breaks up, some optimism for the rest of the week, more in the way of sunshine. The downside is that the Knights will be fairly chilly, and quite a chilly start to tomorrow morning. A mixture of sunshine and showers across the UK, showers could be just about anywhere, through the afternoon mainly across northern and eastern parts of the country where they will be heaviest. Best sunshine further south and west. Temperatures still lower than they should be but compared with the past few days, southern Scotland, Northern Ireland, southern Scotland, Northern Ireland, northern England, it will feel that little bit warmer. But a chilly night will follow. In the countryside it could get very close to freezing. Yes, it is late july. Not quite as cool down in eastern England, but a strong wind, easing through the day. Most on Thursday will have a predominantly dry day if not completely dry, with some sunshine. Some showers into Scotland later on, replaced by more persistent wet and windy weather as we finish Friday. Away from that, much of the day will be dry, sunny, and just a little bit warm. Thank you very much. A reminder of our top story this lunchtime. There’s been a sharp acceleration in economic growth helped by a big increase in oil and gas production. At all from us now on BBC One, time for the news where you are. Good afternoon - I’m Asad Ahmad. A charity in south-east London says it has seen a rise in the number of families accused by social services of ""beating"" their children. World of Hope in Greenwich say some families are using ""inappropriate levels of violence"" to discipline their children, and so the charity is trying to educate parents about what is and isn’t acceptable. Ayshea Buksh has been looking at the issue. This is a single mum living in south-east London. Adele did not want to be identified because of her children. When her six-year-old daughter misbehaved, she would smack her, sometimes with a shoe. The school discovered bruises on her body, and social services intervened. Soon afterwards, her daughterand intervened. Soon afterwards, her daughter and young son were taken into care. That was three years ago. Did you beat her often or was it just occasionally? No, not often. I can say she does not live in if you talk to her, and that is why. Another parent I spoke to as also had her children taken into care, for the same reasons. Growing up in Nigeria, she says her father would hit her in the same way. To be a single mum is not easy. In our country, if my dad wants, he beats me. If I do something bad, he will beat me, or he is harsh with me. Next time I will not do it again. People use a cane, they use a broom, they use about. And there is another weapon, which we call the horse whip. The director of Greenwich charity says they have had an increase in African families contacting them. They advise parents on how to without violence. We started with 13 weeks of parental workshop, which teaches them how to manage their own emotion. Last month the case was heard here at the High Court of young boy who was beaten by his Indian father with a belt. During testimony, the seven-year-old boy was asked how he felt he replied, said, butl boy was asked how he felt he replied, said, but I am brave, Iam not scared of him, but I am usually said. The judge sitting concluded that the harsh treatment of the boy did not merit the term physical abuse. She said proper allowances should be made for a different cultural context. I want to say there should not be a cultural justification. This lady was severely beaten as a child by her Nigerian parents in the 1970s, and still has the scars of. There was no intervention from her school or social services. It is notjust an African problem, it is a human being problem, cutting across races, wherever you are from. The problem is there. I think some of the issues are raised from the fact of how you were brought up when you were young. Violence on a child can never be justified, but those who work with families say it is a convex issue, which needs more attention in order to help reduce children’s suffering. The Metropolitan Police will look into claims that there was a cover-up in the case of a serial killer who pushed 18 people to their deaths on the London Underground between the 1950s and ‘80s. Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan Howe says the allegations made in a new book by a former detective ""sounded quite convincing"". But he added the suggestion that ""government ministers"" kept the deaths secret to avoid public hysteria was hard to believe. The detail of it sounded quite convincing. I’m not sure why no action was taken at the time. We have said we will contact him and tried to get to the bottom of it. We ",,

Nice weather for ducks but not cows, farmers count the cost of our dismal summer. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. The UK economy has picked up the pace with growth up 0.7% in the three months tojune - helped by a big jump in oil and gas production. Gross domestic product- the value of all the UK’s goods and services - has now got back to its peak before the recession in 2008. The question now is whether it will increase the pressure to raise interest rates which have sat at an historic low of 0.5% for five years. Our industry correspondent john Moylan reports. The economy is on the move. Like this plastics company in Derbyshire. It makes windows and doors. In recent years it has doubled staff and sales. It has also reversed the pay cuts that helped it survive during the recession. The economy has improved for us. Most of the money we make is from house refurbishment. So from going back to five years ago the market was really awful. But now it is really picking up. In the three months to june the economy grew by 0.7%. Much stronger than the 0.4% seen earlier in the year. But manufacturing fell by 0.3% and construction was flat, so it was services, the biggest part of the economy, that pushed growth higher. North Sea production also helped. Boosted by tax breaks. And it means economic output per head of population, a key indicator of prosperity, is back at prerecession levels. For the Chancellor, it was more evidence that the economy is moving up a gear. I think these figures show that Britain’s motoring ahead with our economy producing as much per person as ever before. But there are clear risks out there in the world’s economy from the Eurozone, to what is happening in the world stock market, so we have to stay on the road that we set out on. I think the Chancellor needs to focus much more on getting healthier growth than this. If we are going to withstand some of those international pressures from China, from Europe. A balanced recovery would be one that also focuses on construction, which remains flat, and manufacturing, which is going backwards. Earlier this year the economy was stuck in slow motion. Performing under par. But now, growth is speeding up thanks to service industries. Anything from hotels to restaurants, business services to finance. And it is all leading to speculation about whether interest rate rise will come. -- when the interest rate. He expects the rates to start rising at the turn of the year. The figures today pointed to a potential rise towards February with the economy being sufficiently resilient, potentially, to sustain such an initial mild increase. With a rate rise coming, the pound rose. That will not help firms that export. Britain’s economy is far from perfect but overall growth is back on track. What about interest rates? Will we see a rise sooner rather than later? There is one on the horizon. That’ll be a big one for many people. Very important for household owners. Important for savers who have been stuck with low interest rates for a long time. The governor of the Bank of England has said that it will come towards the turn of the year. The exact timings will depend on economic growth. We know that it is picking up. It will depend on wages, and again wage growth has been picking up. And it all depends on what is happening with inflation. Inflation is low at the moment but it is forecast to grow in the months ahead. Today’s number, I don’t think it is accelerated as we would expect, but the consensus is for an interest rate rise somewhere in the first quarter of next year. And when it comes, I think it is going to be modest in size, and the expectation is that any further rises would be spread out over a period of months and years. In a fairly gradual nature. Thank you very much. Lord Sewel - the senior peer caught on camera apparently taking drugs with prostitutes - has resigned from the House of Lords. He said he hoped his decision would ""limit and help repair"" the damage he had done to what he described as ""an institution I hold dear"". It’s prompted renewed calls for reform of the House of Lords which with around 790 members is the largest legislative body outside China. Our political correspondent Vicki Young reports. His political career over, his personal embarrassment complete, Lord Sewel became the first peer to retire in disgrace. But many fear he has damaged the reputation of the house of lords, too. This was his last appearance in the upper chamber. I declared the motion disagreed to, happy recess. Days later he was recorded as calling his colleagues rogues and thieves. The police raided his flat in central London. In a brief statement announcing his resignation Lord Sewel said: Senior peers welcomed the decision. The most important thing for all of us, as members, especially because we are unelected, that we meet the public’s expectations of us at all times. And when we fail, we act swiftly to put it right. Some are using this scandal to argue that the House of Lords needs a shake-up. Critics say it needs cutting down to size. Because at the moment there are 783 Lords. The number turning up, though, is much lower. The average daily attendance last year was just 483. average daily attendance last year wasjust 483. And only average daily attendance last year was just 483. And only 30 wasjust 483. And only 30 peers have taken advantage of a new law that allows them to retire. But even those who want change believe the Lord has an importantjob those who want change believe the Lord has an important job to Lord has an importantjob to do. There are far too many people in it. -- Lords. Too many politicians by trade. The House of Lords is at its best when it has its hearing from a senior civil servant, former doctors, former captains of industry, former trade unionists, who know what they are talking about from a long life experience. But the benches will be even more crowded when David Cameron appoints the next batch of new peers later this year. A court in Libya has sentenced Colonel Gaddafi’s son - Saif al-Islam - and eight others to death for war crimes, including the killing of protestors, during the revolution four years ago. He was not present in court and gave evidence via video link. But at present he’s being held by a former rebel group from the town of Zintan that refuses to hand him over. Our World Editor, john Simpson, reports from Tripoli. These men have been accused of some of the Gaddafi regime’s worst crimes. Murder, torture, theft on a vast scale. Now they are waiting to know their fate. The judges have spent three years and more going through the evidence and the verdicts are clear-cut - death by shooting for Gaddafi’s son, Saif al-Islam. Who is held in another part of Libya. And for eight other men. Life in prison for a further eight. Huge fines, but lesser sentences for others. Four acquitted. As the verdicts are being read the power goes off, there are constant power cuts here now. One of the accused has a seizure brought on by the stress. Another vents his anger at the judges, though we are not allowed to film him. This has been an extraordinary end to an extraordinary trial. One of the prisoners shouting out ""criminals"" at the judges, and the security people not allowing us to film any of this. It must all add yet another question to the entire way that the trial has been conducted. Afterwards, the defence lawyers were angry at the harsh sentences. One of them told us he would appeal. The International Criminal Court has criticised the trial here, but the chief prosecutor insisted it had been completely fair. The proceedings were open to everyone, he said. Will Saif al-Islam be executed? When I met him in his heyday he had been courted by top politicians in Britain, France, and Italy, but at home he was loathed. He remains injail in the town of Zintan. His captors, who are enemies of the Tripoli government, refuse to hand him over. That could just save his life. But whatever the eventual outcome of this trial in Tripoli, most people will feel that justice has been done. Libyanjustice. A man convicted of the murder of Blackpool teenager has beenjailed for life and will serve at least 33 years. Paige Chivers was reported missing in August 2007, but has never been found.

A woman has been awarded a £164,000 from her mother’s assets - despite her mother choosing to cut her out of her will. Heather Ilott from Hertfordshire went to court after her mother left her entire estate to animal charities when she died in 2004.

Yesterday the court awarded Heather Ilot a third of her mother’s estate because she hadn’t left reasonable financial provision for her daughter in her will. Before this case children cut out of a welcome good only get money from a judge if they could prove they had been financially maintained by their parents. Lawyers say the ruling means people can still be their children out of their well. People will still try to do it and there are a number of people who do it successfully for whatever reason. Those are the cases we don’t really hear about. Those are the cases we don’t really hearabout. Forthose Those are the cases we don’t really hear about. For those wanting to do it they need to be very clear as to why they are doing it. They need to see their solicitor and document why they are doing it. Animals cannot tell anyone about the cruelty they suffer. Charities that have been left money like the RSPCA benefited in this case are concerned. Without legacy income, and we are reliant on that legacy income that the animals we look after. That is where the danger is. The charities are considering an appeal, but for now those who want their money to go to charities and not their children will have to explain their reason in their will. will have to explain their reason in theirwill.

Safety investigators in America say the virgin Galactic spacecraft which crashed during a test like last year came down because of an error by the co-pilot. He died and the craft’s other pilot was seriously injured in the Mojave Desert when the braking system was unlocked too early. The crash was a major set back to Sir Richard Branson’s plans to take tourists to space. Our transport correspondent, Richard Westcott, reports. Seen for the first time. These are the last moments of Virgin Galactic spaceship. just 13 seconds into the flight, it disintergrated in mid air, spreading debris across five miles of the California desert. Tragically, the co-pilot died and the pilot suffered serious injuries. Today, investigators confirmed it all came down to this simple handle. It’s the braking system and the co-pilot pulled it 14 seconds too early. The company making and testing the ship, on behalf of Virgin, Scaled Composites, didn’t think it could ever happen. During the design of SpaceShip Two, Scale did not consider the possibility that a pilot would unlock the feather before 1.4Mach. And, as such, no safeguards were built into the feather system design to prevent this. So Richard this is the simulator. Last month, I was given exclusive access to Virgin’s space headquarters in Mojave Desert California. Two, OFIE, I’âlâ8Sâ. Release. In the simulator chief pilot, Dave Mackay, took me through a flight. Dave was flying the mothership, circled here, on the day of the accident. People were shocked and very saddened and there was a lot of... there was a determination to find out what had happened and why it had happened. And this is their new spaceship, Virgin are building it themselves this time. How is it safer? Here at Virgin’s headquarters they have made some changes to the new rocket ship that they’re building. They’ve made it harder to unlock the feathering system. They’ve improved the communication with the pilots and the ground. But they’ve always maintained that the fundamental design of their rocket ship is safe. The company says fewer than 30 customers pulled out because of the crash. Around 700 still want to fly. It’s like many people my age, we’ve seen everybody else get to space, and now, finally, it’s our turn. This radical project is already running seven-years late, but Virgin still insists it is will eventually put ordinary people amongst the stars. Richard Westcott, BBC News. Eurotunnel have revealed that around 2,000 migrants attempted to storm the French terminal at Calais last night. Police confirmed it was the biggest attempt to make the dangerous journey to Britain in recent weeks. It comes as the Home Secretary, Theresa May, today met with her French counterparts to discuss the ongoing disruption on both sides of the Channel. At Calais the French government have put in extra resources. The UK Government will put in £7 million more to ensure the security of the Eurotunnel. With me now is Robert Hall. £7 million by the UK Government, the French are taking action as well. Will this stop the problems we have seen at Calais over recent weeks? It’s an indication of how serious things have got. There were hopes, over the last couple of days, that perhaps the traffic chaos on both sides of the channel the delays might be easing. The news from Eurotunnel is an indication of how unpredictable things are. 4,000 migrants are in make-shift camps around the city. Their efforts to reach the UK, coupled with the industrial action by ferry workers, any improve am can only be temporary. Eurotunnel warned holidaymakers they temporary. Eurotunnel warned holidaymakers they shouldn’t come to northern France at all. Find another route across the Channel until it’s sorted out. That £7 million is on top of £12 sorted out. That £7 million is on top of £12 million announced last year. It’s specifically to improve the security around the Eurotunnel terminal. That includes technological improvements. There is fencing there. The British have sent security fencing. That will go up in the coming days. Theresa May and her French counterpart are stressing with the importance of working with African countries to offer more help from those fleeing from poverty and reduce what they called the drivers of migration. The M20 still a giant car park, basically. Motoring organisations say saying there is no sign as to when all this will end. Robert, thank you very much. For the first time, undercover policing in England and Wales is being publicly examined by a formal inquiry. It follows claims by lawyers of more than 80 possible miscarriages ofjustice relating to undercover policing - including spying on the family of the murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence, using the names of dead children to create fake identities and having sexual relationships with women involved in campaign groups. june Kelly has more. The investigation into the murder of the black teenager Stephen Lawrence was marred by police failings. It was only last year that it emerged that as his parents fought to bring his killers tojustice, undercover officers were gathering evidence on them. The same was happening to other grieving families. This will now form part of the inquiry into undercover policing. From Stephen’s father today, some reservations about how it will be run. It’s a judge-led inquiry, butjust one person, sitting down to make all the decisions. I would person, sitting down to make all the decisions. Iwould have decisions. I would have rather it was more than one person. The inquiry will also examine the behaviour of undercover officers like Bob Lambert who had relationships with activists they were spying on. He had a son with one campaigner, but then abandoned both the child and his mother. She finally learned the truth in 2012. She doesn’t want her face shown. There is no circumstance where having sexual relationships in order to get information on a group. No way, whatever the group is, is ever justified. It’s ruined lives. OK. It’s ruined... It took my son’s childhood away. No-one is entitled to do that anyone. It was the infiltration of protest groups which reveal the scale of secret policing and the role of a a disbanded Scotland Yard unit. The inquiry will hear from its former officers. I was a grown adult when I did the work. I felt that what I was doing was correct. I should never have gone near that sort of work with hindsight. june Kelly, BBC News. Nato has voiced strong support for Turkey in its efforts to maintain stability on its border with Syria and Iraq. Nato has been holding emergency talks in Brussels to discuss Turkey’s decision to launch air strikes against so-called Islamic State and other militants in Syria. David Cameron has promised a crackdown on criminals who hide stolen or laundered money by buying luxury properties in Britain. In a speech in Singapore, the Prime Minister declared there is no place in the UK for what he’ll called ""dirty money."" We are one of the most open and welcoming economies anywhere in the world. I want Britain to be that country, but I want to ensure that all this money is clean money. There is no place for dirty money in Britain. Indeed, there should be no place for dirty money anywhere. That is my message to foreign fraudsters. London is not a place to stash your dodgy cash. The Ashes resumes tomorrow at Edgbaston in what looks like a pivotal Test match. The series stands at 1-1, with three to play. But Australia’s dominant victory over England in the last Test has left the initiative firmly with them. Our sports correspondent, joe Wilson, is in Birmingham now. England do consider this to be quite a lucky ground. They really like the passion that the people of Birmingham tend to bring to a Test match. This time tomorrow here I expect it will be quite raucous. The series so far, England great in Cardiff, Lord’s, by their own admission, was a disaster. The cricket, in short, rather like the weather this week - changeable. When you look at the way they’ve decorated the stadium, it’s a good job Ian Bell kept his place in England’s team here. Warwickshire’s homegrown star was on community duty this week for Edgbaston’s charity. He even bats against school children with a certain flourish. But Bell was part of a grim capitulation the last time England faced Australia. Second innings at Lord’s, all out in just 37 overs, defeated by 405 runs. It takes a lot of mental strength, doesn’t it, to come back from that? It certainly does. There’s no doubt. I look in that dressing room now, there’s a lot of tough cricketers in there. A lot of exciting guys with not a lot of natural ability. I think Australia proved exactly how you can turn things round, we’ve got to look at them as a great example we can do the same. The confidence in the dressing room, even though it’s maybe hit a little bit, but still believes if we play like we did in Cardiff, we can beat Australia. That’s the important thing. Well, that the point, the series still stands at 1-1. Having grabbed the initiative, are Australia really going to hand it back? I think it’s important for us to run with this momentum, while we have it. Take confidence from Lord’s, but also remember how England were in Cardiff. We know how good an opposition they are. Australia’s captain speaks well to the media, measured, methodological, but nobody’s perfect. Walk out to bowl with no wickets. So we need to execute our skills like we did if Lord’s if we want to have s... SUCCESS. That’s not the first time that’s come out the wrong way. Birmingham’s a broad minded city and the series so far has been quite friendly. joe Wilson, BBC News at the Ashes at Edgbaston. She’s nearly 37-years-old, and is a record breaker. jia jia is thought to be the oldest panda ever kept in captivity. Herage, in human years, over100. The animals normally live to around 20 in the wild. A big birthday bash has been taking where she lives in Hong Kong to celebrate. Sangita Myska has the story. For a Guinness World Record holder, jia jia is taking fame in her stride. Presented with a specially designed birthday cake, it was the more traditional option of sugar cane that she clearly preferred, and who can blame her for not changing her ways. Because, at37, 110 in human years, jia jia is now the oldest giant panda in captivity. It is rare. If you look by numbers, only eight animals, out of 397 alive now under human care, have reached any age beyond 30. So that’s a very, very small percentage of the panda population that live to that age. So we can say it’s quite exceptional. Equally exceptional are these three, the only surviving panda triplets in captivity who celebrated their first birthdays in China yesterday. Pandas are exceptionally difficult to care for in captivity, but with their habitats being rapidly eroded by human development, some argue that captive breeding programmes may be their only chance of survival. Meanwhile, back in Hong Kong, vets caring forjia jia say that despite trouble with her eyes and arthritis she is in good health. Sangita Myska, BBC News. Time for a look at the weather. Here’sjohn Hammond. ~ I was thinking about not letting you backin I was thinking about not letting you back in here unless you have a better forecast than yesterday? Charming. It was only four weeks ago that we broke the record forjuly. 37 degrees. Too hot for some, now of course it’s too cold for many. 14 degrees again today. We were shivering across parts of Scotland and far north of England with persistent rain. Heavy showers to Ireland, thunderstorms across the heart of England and Wales towards East Anglia as well, rumbling into the evening. There will be showers around overnight tonight being in on the wind. The rain will break up into showers. Feeling cool out there, 10-11 degrees. Another fresh start tomorrow morning. Tomorrow will be a better day, particularly for those who have really suffered over the last couple of days. There will be brightness across the heart of Scotland, Northern Ireland and northern England. The showers will be sharp. They will move through quickly on the breeze. They won’t last all that long. Hopefully! A better day, better temperatures too. 15 better day, better temperatures too. 15 degrees is below what it should be at this time of year. Similar values to Scotland and Northern Ireland. Showers dotted around. One or two moving into the Midlands. There could be interuptions to the Test match. There will be a cool breeze, so take something warm. 20 maybe 21 degrees in one or two lucky places. Tomorrow night, it will be a cold one. One degree in the Glenns of Scotland, particularly chilly by Thursday morning. There will be chilly nights later on this week. By day, I’m expecting dryer, brighter weather. A warming theme as we go towards the weekend. There will be some sunshine, but how long the weather lasts is another matter. More rain on the horizon, I’m afraid. john, thank you very much. On tonight’s BBC News at Ten, the second in our series of special investigations into human trafficking. We report from Nigeria, where a trafficker tells us she gets paid $500 for every woman she brings into Europe for prostitution. That’s all from the BBC News at Six, so it’s goodbye from me, and on BBC One we nowjoin the BBC’s news teams where you. Tonight on BBC London News: Taken into care - the alarming rise in the number of families being accused of ‘beating’ their children. They use a broom, the user belt, some of them use a stick to beat their children. Charities call for more parents to be educated about cultural differences to prevent children going into care. Also tonight: Many of the Met’s police vans are being fitted out with CCTV in order to build transparency and increased trust in the force. Murder on the Tube. Police look into historic claims that a serial killer may have pushed 12 people onto the tracks. And variety returns to the Hoxton Hall in East London after a £2 million makeover. Good evening and welcome to the programme, with me, Alex Bushill. The number of children being taken into care because their parents beat them, is rising at an ""alarming rate"". Figures from a London charity say that in just two months they’ve dealt with 30 cases where children have been taken away because of abuse in the home. That’s more than in the entire previous year. It’s led to calls for better education, particularly for African families who charities say are far more likely to be affected. Ayshea Buksh reports. Adele is a single mum living in south-east London. She did not want to be identified because of her children. When her six-year-old daughter misbehaved, she would smack her, sometimes with a shoe. The school discovered bruises on her daughter’s body and social services intervened. Soon after, Adele’s daughter and young son were taken into care. That was three years ago. Did you beat her often, or was it just occasionally? No, not often. I can say she does not listen if you talk to her, so that is why. Another parent I spoke to has also had her two children taken into care for the same reasons as Adele. Growing up in Nigeria, she says her father would hit her in the same way. To be a single mum is not easy. In our country, if my dad wants, he beats me. Even other people too. If I do something bad, he would beat me. So when I do something bad, he beats me or is harsh with me. Next time I will not do it again. ",,

People use a cane, they use a broom, they use a belt, and there is another weapon which we call the horse whip. The director of a parenting charity based in Greenwich says they have seen an increase in African families contacting them. They advise parents on how to discipline without violence. We started with 13 weeks of parental workshops, then it teaches them how to manage their own emotions. The law currently regards smacking as reasonable chastisement. It is allowed so long as the child is left with no injuries or marks, such as a bruise. just last month, the case was heard here at the High Court of a young boy who was beaten by his Indian father with a belt. The judge sitting concluded that the harsh treatment of the boy did not merit the term physical abuse, and she said that proper allowances should be made for a different cultural context. This one is with cable wire, that my mother did. Lydia was severely beaten as a child by her Nigerian parents in the 1970s and still has the scars. There was no intervention from her school or social services. I wouldn’t say there shouldn’t be a culturaljustification. It is notjust an African problem, it is human being problem. It cuts across races, wherever you’re from, it doesn’t matter. The problem is there. This barrister worked on the Victoria enquiry. One of the most tragic child abuse cases in legal history. Yet she believes when it comes to some cases of physical chastisement, children being taken into care is not always the right solution. Those children will remain, or be sent to the care system. Six weeks in care changes a child, traumatised as a child far beyond that smack the parent gave. Another charity says there is a disproportionate number of African children being taken away from their parents, and they have been overwhelmed with cases recently, at they say the work is achieving results. I have the right to beat my tale, they are initially saying, I see them change from that too, I never knew I could do this, I never knew I could do that. There is a genuine feeling of, wow, if I had known this I would not have resorted to this. People can change. At Dell has completed a parenting course on discipline. The way they treat course -- children here is different to the way they treat children in Nigeria. If you want to talk to them, you do it politely, as if you are talking to your mates, and instead of beating them you send them to the naughty corner. I encourage them to know that they will definitely come back home. They want to come home. The question is, if the law robust enough to protect children? The United Nations said the UK should pass laws banning smacking children in the home. The government was lobbied back in 2001+ to say there should be an outright ban. Smacking is regarded by many as a valid parenting tool. The Department of Education said the government policy on smacking is clear, they do not condone violence towards children, but they do not want to criminalise parents are issuing a mild smack. What needs to happen to improve the situation. There does need to be a clear distinction between smacking and abuse. This issue is culturally sensitive. just in the way that FGM was, and domestic violence was in this country, cultural consideration must this country, cultural consideration must be made but notjustified, and what needs to happen is specific help from grassroots charities who can work with other cultures that they have experience. They need to understand why families are beating their children. These charities are notjust their children. These charities are not just working with their children. These charities are notjust working with London, they say this is a nationwide problem. They have cases in Essex, Cornwall and Manchester. They want councils and authorities to get on board, the charities. Thank you very much. Lots more to come, including: The cost of policing our football matches. Who should foot the £2 million a year bill? Ajudge has ruled the North London Coroner was wrong to order an invasive post mortem on the body of an orthodox jewish woman. Her family argued using a scalpel would desecrate her body and demanded instead a CT scan on religious grounds. New guidelines will now be drafted for all coroners to follow. Victoria Hollins is at the High Court for us now. This is a landmark ruling. It is indeed, and the case of a family of an Orthodoxjewish women who died last September. Medics could not agree on what caused her death, and in the London coroner, it was ruled that her postmortem examination should be carried out. The family were vehemently opposed to that, because it said it would desecrate her body, they wanted a scan to take place instead to identify the cause of death. They had to get an injunction in the end to prevent the postmortem examination in the traditional sense from being carried out. Today the High Courtjudge said that the women had been wrong to pursue a postmortem examination without allowing for the family’s desires. The coroner had shown a flawed approach to decision making and should have allowed this to happen on religious grounds. The family’s solicitor agreed. Previously most coroner ‘s recognised that was the law, and when people asked for a noninvasive coroner bent over backwards. This coroner did not, we do not understand why, but she has been firmly told, this is the law and you and any other coroner have to allow a religious person their rights. Noninvasive autopsies will become more common, then? These are still pretty rare because they are carried out specifically for members of the Orthodox jewish and out specifically for members of the Orthodoxjewish and Muslim Orthodox jewish and Muslim communities Orthodoxjewish and Muslim communities will stop there are only eight centres across the country where these are carried out. Only one in London. Scanning used in conjunction with other noninvasive techniques can find the cause of sudden death cases, around 75% of cases. When a family is agreed, when I religious grounds, when the family agreed to meet the extra cost of scams, there is most no reason why they should not be carried out on religious grounds -- they should not be carried out on religious grounds -- scans. Thank you, Victoria. A man has been cleared of killing a father of two last year, in a party prank which went wrong. 23-year-old Tommy Main died after being punched by Desmond Bartley in a game which involved the two men taking turns to hit each other at a party in Erith last year. The formal cause of death was given as a cardiac arrest and the presence of cocaine and alcohol. Lambeth says it’s become the first authority in the capital to ban the use and supply of nitrous oxide, known as laughing gas, in public areas across the borough. Anybody caught breaching the new order could face a maximum fine of £1,000. It follows the death of Ally Calvert from south-east London. The 18-year-old is believed to have taken nitrous oxide. All Metropolitan Police vans used to transport suspects to police stations will be equipped with CCTV cameras. The new pledge comes at a time when the force is looking to increase transparency and public trust. A review into deaths in custody is also underway - and an inquiry began today into undercover policing. Here’s our Home Affairs Correspondent Nick Beake. We can still record. The Met commissioner hopes this technology will show Londoners his officers are doing theirjob properly. By the end of the summer, there will be CCTV on all 130 police vans which take suspects to custody. It cost £21+00 to equip each van, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe says it is money well spent. The point at which we arrest somebody, to keeping them in custody, will be recorded. I think thatis custody, will be recorded. I think that is a positive thing, because we can capture evidence, which is helpful. But if there are complaints about police behaviour, we can check. The cameras start recording when the ignition switched on. There are five, one in the front, one at the back, and three in the van itself. There is also a microphone picks up everything being said, and two monitors to show what exactly is happening in front. This is something this family have long campaigned for. The 1+0-year-old musician died in Brixton police station in 2008. One of the cases which has led to a review of deaths in custody. He spent 11 minutes in a police van after he was arrested. What is fundamental is that the cameras must be working. For another sentence to be uttered that the cameras were not working will be unacceptable for all families, as has been for decades. The plebgate affair, as well as allegations that Stephen Lawrence’s family were spied on dented trust in the police. The Met hopes these cameras can reverse that. Footage will be deleted after 22 days if it is not needed in an investigation. This is being billed as an extra evidence gathering tooL as an extra evidence gathering tool, but also annexed check on those who police are city. -- tool, but also annexed check on those who police are city. -- an extra check. A number of tube drivers have been sent home without pay after refusing to run services this morning. They were acting on the instruction of their unions who claim unqualified staff are being used to check trains, which isn’t safe. It’s the latest escalation in the long running row over plans for all night Tube services and comes ahead of a strike planned for next week. Katharine Carpenterjoins me now from Great Portland Street. Who exactly should be carrying out the safety checks customer? All Tube trains are to be checked and prepped every 21+ hours. Aslef and RFT unions claim that this is sometimes being done by unqualified members of staff. They have issued a directive to their staff members saying that anyone who is worried should refuse to drive a tube. We understand that today that has led to seven members of staff saying they will not drive trains and being sent home without pay. That led to minor delays on the district line this morning. London Underground is furious about this, saying that, yes, sometimes managers and qualified numbers of staff carry out these checks if, for example, there is staff sickness. But they say this has been going on some time, and at no stage is safety ever compromised. This does not bode well with a strike planned for next week? Absolutely. This is the unions uppins Absolutely. This is the unions upping the anti-. They have said they are very concerned about this, they have said there could be another strike later this month. There was one earlier on in the month, of course. It brought the Tube network to a standstill and led to a great deal of up evil for commuters. There is another strike planned for the 5th of August, and they say that unless the issue overpaying conditions are resolved, that will go ahead. -- the issues over paying conditions will stop London Underground says they are committed to resolving this to put, but with so much anger, the RMT has described this as a very volatile situation. Claims that 12 people were murdered on the London Underground between 1953 and 1983 and were then covered up by the Home Office are to be investigated by British Transport Police. A former detective claims the government feared mass hysteria and that people would stop travelling to work. Today, the Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said the claims could be credible. Tarah Welsh reports. Was the underground once stocked by a serial killer who pushed people from two platforms to their deaths, and got away with it? This foreign detective says yes. Convicted murderer Kieran Kelly confessed to pushing people in front of trains. He was very excited, possibly physically excited by it. Loaded with testosterone and adrenaline. He spilled his guts, told us everything. We could not stop them. We have seen court papers that say when being interviewed about another murder, Kelly told police: at first, jeff. Kelly was lying, but when he started investigating, he was shocked by what he found. He was seen by the police at the scene next to the body! You start to think, maybe he is telling the truth. jeff is convinced he killed at a number of stops along the Northern line. He says the Home Office told the police not to make the information public. The detail that sounded convincing, I am not sure why no action was taken at the time. Apparently the detective was told was something to do with the Home Office not wanting to spread panic. I find that not very persuasive. I cannot say I do not believe it, I will need to takes on persuading as to its reason. I have said we will see about trying to get to the bottom about what was said. There are times during policing you would not want the public to know, but never, I have never heard of anything on this sort of scale. And this nature of Kallis, wishing someone in front of a track, brutally murdering them -- pushing someone. British Transport Police say they believe Kelly is dead, but say they are keen to speak tojeff about any dead, but say they are keen to speak to jeff about any information he does have. We just received a very short statement from the Home Office that says, any evidence that suggests a crime has been committed is a matter for the police. In 1982, Kieran Kelly was acquitted for pushing a man under a train. His lawyers told me he believed his client was a fantasist. jeff is convinced he was a killer that got away with it time and time again. Still to come: Arsenal prepare to make the most of their winning streak as they take on Chelsea this weekend in the Community Shield. And built over 150 years ago, variety returns to the Hoxton Hall in East London after a £2 million makeover. It’s been revealed that it costs the Met almost £2 million to police football matches each year. The new figure from the Mayor’s office has re-ignited the debate over who should pick up the bill for Premier League games. Now there are calls to force the wealthiest clubs to pay instead of London’s tax payers. Chris Slegg reports. We st West Ham and Millwall fans fighting in the street outside Upton Park before Ali cup tie six years ago, the last large scale fight for a football match in London. The cost came in at over £2000. West Ham were only build £18,000, while the public ticked up the rest. Clubs only pay for policing inside the stadium and on the land they own. The London assembly Labour group today renewed calls for that to change. They are profit-making organisations, Premier League clubs, and I think Askin them to pay £2 million between them over the cost of a year is not going to be a huge strain. City Hall says the extra policing costs, the cost to police outside the stadium and land owned by the clubs, wasjust under £2 million last season. Almost 30 million people attend football across the country every season, most recent figures revealjust 1+31 banning orders against fans of London clubs. But while trouble is proportionately rare, football is unique in having huge crowds on a regular basis. The demand on policing is far higher in football than in any other event, particularly because the need for policing to be carried out in a far wider area than in other sports or other events like music events will stop that’s why there is more likely to be discussions over his costs. -- police costs. The football clubs fail to see why they should effectively pay twice for policing. The debate has rumbled on since the 1960s. It is unlikely the cost of preventing the beautiful game from turning ugly will be transferred any soon. -- game from turning ugly will be transferred any soon. -- anytime soon. Well, staying with football, and over the past two weeks they’ve won the Asia Trophy and the Emirates Cup. Now Arsenal are hoping for a hat-trick, making it three out of three when they take on Chelsea in the Community Shield at Wembley on Sunday. So will this be the year the Gunners finally mount a serious challenge for the title? Anjana Gadgil reports. Walcott! They ended last season on a high, winning the FA Cup, and with the first of the season’s silverware up for grabs against Chelsea in the Community Shield, the manager is feeling good. I think now we had good preparation, good preparation brings confidence, and, of course, competition... Confidence is important, but competition demands performance. Arsenal come into the game having won both of their pre-season tournaments, aided by a £10 million signing who knows Chelsea well- their former goalkeeper, Petr Cech. He can, I think, improve the level of communication at the back, you know, and bring his experience to our defenders and bring a calmness as well in heated situations. Chelsea bossjose Mourinho has turned up the heat, saying Arsenal should win more after spending £100 million on players last year. So, with a nearly fully fit squad and no major players sold, how do the fans think their team will fare? I’ve always been talking about getting a world-class keeper. Now we’ve signed Cech, so I feel a bit more confident. I think we can perform much, much better and we can win the Premier League trophy. Can we win the league this year? Yes. Yeah. Yeah! Yeah, of course we can. The league and the FA Cup? Yeah. After the Community Shield, Arsenal focus on the league, hoping for more victory parades come May next year. A Victorian Music Hall, built over 150 years ago has been given a new lease of life. Hoxton Hall in Hackney is to now become the home for 'contemporary variety performance’. And it’s all thanks to a restoration costing millions of pounds. Our Entertainment Correspondent Brenda Emmanus has more. SHE SINGS. This musician performs from an unfamiliar stage. It is the new home of contemporary variety entertainment, Hoxton Hall. Hoxton may be renowned for its trendy bath and clubs, but this grade two listed building is the last surviving salon style Victorian musical in London. Following a £2 million refurbishment, Hoxton Hall is open for business. Hoxton locals and guests were enjoying refreshments in celebration of this hidden gem. They were toasting the relaunch of this treasured East London venue, and the announcement of its new season of events, starting this temper. What are your plans now question -- events, starting this temper. What are your plans now question -- we’re going to be having a contemporary variety show. Reimagining what variety can be for the 21st-century. What sort of thing? Music, comedy, drama, and lots of secret things we cannot tell you about. The theatre was built as a saloon style music all, when it was known as McDonald’s music all. Performers included the likes of Mary Lloyd. The building had various uses, including as a Quaker meeting whole, and a community arts venue. More recently, Patti Smith and Damon Albarn, and Tracey M and, have all performed at the whole. By the end of the 19th century, there were many of these musicals -- music halls in London. Now Hoxton Hall was one of the only ones left. Relaunched as the home of contemporary variety, this musician willjoin the likes of magician Paul Daniels on the programme for next September. East London is changing. It is really important to have something which serves as a hub of the community so that the old and the new like can have somewhere where they can create and share and express. Music halls have contributed to the past, and Hoxton Hall hopes to contribute to the future as well. Time to have a check on the weather forecast. When is the world is going to come back? The ones is going to come back, it is going to be, -- The ones is going to come back, it is going to be, -- the warmth. The 1st ofjuly was a record breaker, and the last day of the month is going to be distantly average. Nearer 22 degrees. We have got clear sky out there, sunny spells, but one or two showers around dragging themselves West to East across London. That will continue to be the case through the night, but most of us will see dry and clear conditions. Winds lightening a little bit, temperatures across parts of Surrey and so good just about falling to single figures -- file into single figures. There will be some sunshine overhead, but clouds coming and going through the day tomorrow, and still a little bit of a breeze blowing. Coming from a north-westerly does -- of a breeze blowing. Coming from a north-westerly does -- direction. Towards the end of the day, the maybe one or two showers across the country that could be heavy. You can see most of those are confined to northern parts of London, Hertfordshire and Essex. 21 degrees again, perhaps a little disappointing in the breeze. By the time we get to Thursday, conditions will be dry and fine. Temperatures again, 20 degrees, not up to much. Not helped by the wind direction, coming in from the north-westerly. Through the week, we swap the wind direction, that will help draw in slightly warmer air, southerly quarter. At the end of the weekend, temperatures could recover to about 21+ degrees. You can see that on the outlook. A lot of dry, fine weather towards the end of the week. It will not always be sunny perhaps but it will be at least bright, temperatures picked up as we change the winter action. Very average enter the month -- the winter action. Very average enter the month -- wind direction. Very average end to the month. The headlines: The UK economy grew by 0.7%. GDP is now back to its peak for the recession in 2008.

I will be back with the 10pm news later this evening. Have a lovely evening. Goodbye. There’s a lot we don’t know about the food on our plates and the shops and the labels don’t always tell you the whole story. I think they encourage you to buy more than you need and that causes a lot of waste. Whether you’re staying in or going out, you told us that you can feel ripped off by the promises made for what you eat and what you pay for. How do you know that it’s half price? So what they’ve done, they’ve bumped the price up and they knocked it down. From claims that don’t stack up to the secrets behind the packaging, we’ll uncover the truth about Britain’s food so you can be sure that you are getting what you expect at the right price. Yourfood, your money. This is Rip-Off Britain. Hello and a very warm welcome to our special series of Rip-Off Britain programmes where we’re investigating our food and drink. Now, today, we’ll be looking at some of the unexpected costs and problems that you could very easily run into if you’re eating while you’re out and about. And by that, we don’t mean dining out at expensive restaurants. What we’re talking about is picking up a meal or a snack at somewhere much less flash when you’re on the go or, indeed, when you’re out for the day and need to grab a bite while you’re there, which is something I think we all do, isn’t it? Of course. Well, it’s a fact that even the most casual meal out can cost a lot more than you bargained for and that’s especially if, as has happened to quite a few of you visiting one very well- known chain, you accidentally outstay your welcome. Coming up... Happy meals but furious customers. Meet the family who paid a big price for their burgers after being told they’d stayed too long in the car park. £100 is a very big fine for parking just 11 minutes over an hour. And three letters that spell out one of the most controversial ingredients in food around but is there really anything to worry about with MSG? It’s not unpleasant. Actually, funnily enough, what it’s doing is it’s making my tastebuds work. Yes. You know, whether you’re a fan of music or sport, it’s hard to beat the thrill of a day out watching your favourite stars perform live in front of your eyes but it can be an expensive business. There’s the price of the ticket, for a start, and the expense doesn’t stop there. Food and drink at the venue can be pricey, which is why many of us might take along some snacks of our own. But if that rings a bell with you, better watch out because some of Britain’s best-known venues take a very dim view of you bringing anything to nibble on or drink.

Scientists including Stephen Hawking call for a ban on robotic weapons, such as remotely piloted drones. We need to execute our skills like we did at Lord’s if we wa nt to have sex...sex...success. And ahead of the third Ashes Test at Edgbaston, Australia’s captain, Michael Clarke, will be hoping his team perform better than he did Later on BBC London, taken into care, the alarming rise in the number of families being accused of beating their children. And the Met in the spotlight again as a public inquiry opens to examine undercover policing. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News At Ten. The economy grew in the three months tojune by 0.7%, with average living standards returning to pre-recession levels. The office for National Statistics says the value of the UK’s goods and services, or GDP, is at its highest level since 2008. But some experts are concerned the growth is creating an imbalance in the economy, with service industries performing well, but construction lagging behind. Nevertheless, there’s now increased speculation about the timing of a possible rise in interest rates. Well, our industry correspondent john Moylan is outside the Bank of England for us tonight. john. Bank of England to set interest rates, but of course that depends on the health of the economy, and today there was good and bad news on that score. Because, yes, economic growth is back on track, but hopes of a big rebalancing of the economy more towards manufacturing, for example, that simply hasn’t happened. The economy is on the move, like this plastics company in Derbyshire, it makes windows and doors. In recent years, it’s doubled staff and sales. It’s also reversed the pay cuts that helped it survive through the recession. The economy’s improved for us. Most of what we make is into house refurbishment or double glazing, so from going back four orfive years ago, the market was really awful, but now it’s really picking up. In the three months to june, the economy grew by 0.7%. Much stronger than the 0.4% seen earlier in the year, but manufacturing fell by 0.3% and construction was flat. So it was services, the biggest part of the economy, that pushed growth higher. North Sea oil and gas production also helped. It’s been boosted by tax breaks. For the Chancellor, it was all evidence that the economy is moving up a gear. Well, I think these figures show that Britain is motoring ahead with our economy producing as much per person as ever before, but there are clear risks outside in the world economy, from the eurozone, to what’s happening in the world’s stock markets. So we’ve got to stay on the road that we’ve set out on. I think that the Chancellor needs to focus much more on getting healthier growth than this if we’re going to withstand some of those international pressures from China, from Europe. A balanced recovery would be one that also focuses on construction, which remains flat, and manufacturing, which is going backwards. Earlier this year, the economy was stuck in slow motion, performing under par, but now growth is speeding up thanks to service industries, everything from hotels to restaurants, business services to finance, and it’s all leading to speculation about when an interest-rate rise will come. The figures that we have today point at a potential rise towards February with the economy being sufficiently resilient potentially to sustain such an initial mild increase. That will worry some firms and households. Britain’s economy is far from perfect, but overall growth is back on track. Well, tonight members of the key committee at the bank face a dilemma, because, yes, growth is at healthy, normal levels, but interest rates are not, they are still at crisis levels, as they have been for the past six years. Now, that situation will have to change, the consensus here in the City is for an interest rate rise in the first quarter of next year. That, when it comes, will have really big implications for ourselves, businesses and savers alike. john, many thanks for that, john Moylan at the Bank of England. Human trafficking is a global problem, with the United Nations saying victims come from as many as 152 countries and a third of those trafficked are children. Well, this week the BBC News At Ten is focusing on the issue, and tonight we’re in Nigeria, the second largest nationality trafficked to the UK. The routes and methods to bring people here change constantly but include overland journeys via Libya on to Italy, through Iran to Turkey, or via West Africa. The majority of people trafficked from Nigeria come from the area around Benin City, from where Tomi oladipo has sent us this special report. It is a place of hidden cruelty, the streets which hide a brutal trade in a world where traffickers thrive. By road, it’s a 50-50 chance. And at times some do die. They die. Many people are drawn to this bustling city. It is the launch pad to Europe, where the wealth of those who have travelled abroad is visible. We are in Benin City, which is known as a trafficking hub. Most of the women and girls who end up in Europe as prostitutes say they come from here, and this is where the first stage of the trafficking process begins, when recruiters come here to markets and hair salons to look for their victims, before them fly them or take them overland through the Sahara Desert and then over the Mediterranean Sea to Europe. Most of those who get trafficked do not know they will end up on the streets as prostitutes. We spoke to one woman who was promised a job as a sales attendant. She is keen to warn other potential victims of the dangers, but she’s too scared to be identified. The person said that I’m going there to work in a supermarket, as a salesgirl, so that is why I travel. When I got to Russia, it was really, really hell for me. We set off to meet a trafficker. After weeks of negotiations, and on the promise of anonymity, she agreed to speak to us. The traffickers have sophisticated methods of operating. Using mostly female recruiters, they entrap the girls and send them to women abroad known as madams, who then enslave them as prostitutes. Sometimes we scout for them, sometimes they look for us. Some of them, their parents encourage them. They say, you are here, loafing around, doing nothing, why don’t you go abroad and make money? We get the passport for them. The madams can say we need three, we need four. It depends on how many she wants. At times, I get $300-500 per person. Some women who get caught in this web are locked in houses either in Nigeria, in transit to Europe, or in their destination countries, where they are put through a form of training. The regional head of Nigeria’s anti-trafficking agency explains how it works. The madams teach these girls the kind of words you have to use to approach your clients, all right? The mode of dressing, and then some of the victims also made us to know that they could be kept indoors for, like, two weeks on arrival. They are well fed, oK? And they are taught some sexual skills. There is a strong belief in witchcraft here, so the traffickers exploit this to keep their victims trapped. We take them to see native doctors. They make them swear that when they get there, because it is our money we are using to take them there, that they will pay. The native doctor will instil fear into them and tell them, if they do not pay, they will die. She claims she has been trafficking for five years. We pushed her on why she did it and if she would do that to her own children. She became upset and told us that she had stopped. I went into it because of the money. I feel bad! I will not even allow my children to do that. Later, our contact insisted that she does still traffick girls. Those that make it to the other side are imprisoned in a life of prostitution and slavery. Their traffickers demand tens of thousands of pounds before they are supposed to regain their freedom. When I got there, the first thing they took from me was my passport. They took my documents from me and said, if I don’t do what they ask me to do, they will kill me. I said, oK, what do you people want? They said, there is nothing like a supermarket or boutique, that I am here to work for them as a prostitute. Another woman was trafficked to Italy, where she spent five years in prostitution. She suffered beatings and rape before she was deported back to Nigeria. My madam did not tell me how much I was going to pay here. Each time I go to work, she would tell me to pull off all of my clothes and search all over my body. I was able to pay her £19,000. Even when I had given her that money, she told me to bring more money. I said, how much do you want me to bring? She said, until I am satisfied. The government hasjoined NGOs in getting serious about fighting trafficking, but the web is so entrenched that it is difficult to untangle. The challenges of life in Nigeria push many to seek success abroad, creating the perfect conditions for traffickers to exploit. A few victims are fortunate to eventually break free and return home, but the damage done to them remains haunting, possibly for the rest of their lives. Tomi oladipo, BBC News, Benin City, Nigeria. And tomorrow we’ll have another report in the series, this time from America, where the FBI tells us child exploitation is at near epidemic levels. Eurotunnel has revealed around 2,000 migrants tried to break into the French terminal at Calais last night. Police confirmed it was the largest attempt to try to make the journey to Britain in recent weeks. Today the Home Secretary, Theresa May, met with her French counterpart to discuss the ongoing disruption on both sides of the Channel. Britain has agreed to provide more money to help deal with the crisis. Our correspondent Duncan Kennedy is overlooking the M20 near Maidstone. Duncan, we know the situation is pretty fraught on the other side of the channel, how bad things where you are? Well, Clive, you can see the consequences tonight and the M20, closed southbound for three junctions to cars, just these lorries being allowed down in a pulse action controlled by police, in an operation called Operation Stack. Effectively, the M20 is a car park for lorries tonight, all because of that migrant action last night when those 2000 migrants tried to get into the Eurotunnel area. Eurotunnel tell us that nearly all of their 200 security staff, as well as local police, overwhelmed by the numbers, the biggest in a couple of months. At the same time today we have a secretary and her counterpart, Theresa May, meeting. She has promised a next £7 million for security. You only have this peak to the likes of Eurotunnel, freight operators, local people, they will tell you this needs a much bigger reaction, and they are now calling this a national crisis. OK, Duncan, thanks for that, calling this a national crisis. OK, Duncan, thanks forthat, Duncan Kennedy reporting for us. Lord Sewel, the senior peer caught on camera apparently taking drugs with prostitutes, has resigned from the House of Lords. He said he hoped his decision would ""limit and help repair"" the damage he’d done to what he described as ""an institution I hold dear."" There have now been renewed calls for reform of the House of Lords. Critics say it’s too big and lacks accountability. A court in Libya has sentenced Colonel Gaddafi’s son, Saif al-Islam, and eight other former regime officials to death for war crimes, including the killing of protestors during the revolution four years ago. Saif al-Islam was once seen as his father’s heir apparent, but was captured trying to flee the country in 2011. His trial has been criticised by human rights groups, but there’s uncertainty the sentence will ever be carried out. He’s being held by a militia group that so far has refused to hand him over to the authorities in Tripoli. Our world affairs editor, john Simpson, was the only western journalist in court for today’s hearing. These men have been accused of some of the Gaddafi regime’s worst crimes - murder, torture and death on a vast scale. Now they are waiting to know their fate. Saif Al-Islam Gaddafi. .. The judges have spent three years or more going through the evidence, and the verdicts are clear-cut - death by shooting for Gaddafi’s son, Said al-Islam, who’s held in another part of Libya, and for eight other men. Life imprisonment for a further eight. Huge fines, but lesser sentences for others, four acquitted. As the verdicts are being read, the power goes off- there are constant power cuts here now. One of the accused has a seizure, brought on by the stress. SHOUTING Another vents his anger at the judges, though we’re not allowed to film him. This has been an extraordinary end to an extraordinary trial. One of the prisoners shouting out ""criminals"" at the judges, and the security people not allowing us to film any of this. It must all add yet another question mark to the entire way that the trial’s been conducted. Afterwards, the defence lawyers were angry at the harsh sentences. One of them told us he’d appeal. The International Criminal Court has criticised the trial here, but the chief prosecutor insisted it had been completely fair. ""The proceedings were open to everyone"", he said. Will Saif al-Islam be executed now? When I met him in his heyday, he’d been courted by top politicians in France, Italy, and especially in Britain as the favourite son of a rich dictator. He was given a suspect doctorate by the London School of Economics. But at home, he was loathed. When he was caught after his father’s downfall, he was plainly terrified, with some reason - the people who arrested him chopped off his forefinger, the one he liked to wag in people’s faces on television. Saif is still injail in the town of Zintan. His captors, who are enemies of the Tripoli government, have refused to hand him over, and that could just save his life. But whatever the eventual outcome of this trial in Tripoli, most people here will feel thatjustice has been done - Libyanjustice. john Simpson, BBC News, Tripoli. The EU’s foreign policy chief has visited Iran to ensure the deal restricting the country’s nuclear programme, which she helped to negotiate, is properly implemented. On her first official visit to the country, Federica Mogherini and Iran’s Foreign Minister, javad Zarif, said there was now a clear opportunity to begin a new chapter in relations with the West. Our chief international correspondent, Lyse Doucet, reports now from Tehran. Europe’s top diplomat stepped into bright sunshine in bright colours, too. REPORTER: Glad to be here? ""Good to be here"", she says, but she knows there’s a hard road ahead. Even her short ride through Tehran takes her past Iran’s defining symbols, including this iconic monument the revolution renamed Azadi, freedom. First stop, the elegant Foreign Ministry. Ms Mogherini spent many hours in talks with Iran’s Foreign Minister, Zarif, in European capitals to clinch the deal two weeks ago. She’s come to his city to ensure it’s implemented. Now it is time to show that not only reaching the deal, but starting to work on the implementation of the deal is going to be historical. REPORTER: MrZarif, when it comes to implementation, how worried are you about whether Iran can keep its commitments? As you know, some senior officials have said that some of Iran’s red lines have been crossed in this deal? TRANSLATION: When Iran promises something, it’s faithful to its promise. So long as this goes through all of our legal procedures, I have no doubt this deal will be implemented. Ms Mogherini knows there’s still strong criticism in the West and the region, including Iran. She wants to hear all points of view here. It’s in offices like, of the Parliamentary Speaker, where Ms Mogherini will hear real concerns about this deal. There have been threats in the parliament itself saying that the deal threatens Iran’s security. But the real power in this land, the Supreme Leader, is known to have given it his blessing, and that’s what matters most. And, most Iranians back the deal, too. They want the real deal when it comes to improving their lives. A very young population takes more interest in a technology revolution than in an Iranian one before they were born, but there’s strong pride here in being Iranian. TRANSLATION: I’m really pleased the Foreign Ministers are coming, I hope they get to know what Iran is really like. In the past, the image of our country has been abused by ourselves and by others. All roads already seem to lead to Tehran. Every week brings another high-level delegation from Europe, all keen to take advantage of all the opportunities here, but it all depends on this deal. That’s why its supporters are doing everything they can to make it work. Lyse Doucet, BBC News, Tehran. A man convicted of the murder of a Blackpool teenager has been jailed for life and will serve at least 33 years. 15-year-old Paige Chivers was reported missing in August 2007, but has never been found. Robert Ewing, who’s 60, was convicted of murder at Preston Crown Court earlier this month. The judge said he’d carried out a ""carefully planned and executed murder."" A public inquiry has started into undercover policing in England and Wales. It was ordered last year after it was revealed that undercover officers had infiltrated protest groups and claims they had spied on the family of the murdered teenager, Stephen Lawrence. A woman has been awarded £16lI,000 from her mother’s estate, despite being cut out of her will. Heather Ilott, from Hertfordshire, went to court after her mother left all her assets to animal charities when she died in 2004. As our legal affairs correspondent, Clive Coleman, reports the ruling could mean more wills will be challenged by surviving adult children. For years families have been falling out over wills, but who gets the final say? Heather Ilott fell out with her mother, Melita jackson, decades ago when she eloped at the age of 17. When her mother died in 2004, she made crystal clear she didn’t want her daughter to benefit and so left her estate to animal charities with which she had little connection. Yesterday, the Court of Appeal awarded Mrs Ilott, who has little money, a third of her mother’s £500,000 estate because she hadn’t left reasonable financial provision for her daughter in the will. Before this case, children cut out of a will could only get money from a judge if they could prove they’d been financially maintained by the deceased, so that generally applied to younger children. This ruling means that adult children, who inherit nothing, stand a much better chance of claiming through the courts. Lawyers say the ruling means people can still leave their children out of their will. People will still try to do it and there are a number of people who do it quite successfully, for whatever reason, and those are the cases that we don’t really hear about. All I would say is, that for those wanting to do it, they need to be very clear as to why they’re doing it. Animals can’t tell anyone about the cruelty they suffer. Charities that have been left money, like the RSPCA, who benefitted in this case, are concerned. Without legacy income and we are reliant for 50% of the animals that we protect and treat, we’re reliant on that legacy income. We have that need. That, for us, is the danger. The charities are considering an appeal, but for now those who want their money to go to charity and not their children will need to explain their reasons fully in their wills. Even then, the will could be challenged. Clive Coleman, BBC News. More than 1,000 scientists, including Stephen Hawking, have called for a ban on developing artificial intelligence for military use and to build robotic weapons. Remotely piloted drones have played a controversial role in military operations by countries like America. However, in an open letter, the group said technology could end up being developed without human intervention and could fall into the hands of terrorists and dictators. Our science editor, David Shukman, has the story. A drone gets ready for takeoff. It has a human operator who’s always in control, especially of a trigger. But will future drones make their own decisions? These robot centuries in South Korea need permission to fire, but will the coming decades see guns with more autonomy? Stephen Hawking recently warned about artificial intelligence or AI. I think that the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race. Today, he joined a mass appeal for Alto be kept away from weapons, something many are worried about. It is extremely dangerous because a machine doesn’t have our kind of sensibilities. I’m not talking about some sort of super intelligent AI that you see in the movies, we’re talking about ongoing research at the moment by at least six countries, developing weapons guided by artificial intelligence. The oldest autonomous weapons are mines, triggered automatically. But there’s the prospect of devices that’ll be smart enough to choose targets. They would be able to pull the trigger far past faster than human operators could. Now that would accelerate the pace of any conflict. It would also vastly increase the risk of an accidental use of weapons. The fear would be of a new arms race, as countries try to maintain a lead. This comes as robotics and artificial intelligence make rapid progress in all kinds of fields, far beyond the military. Today at the Bristol Robotics Lab, Professor Winfield told me he had signed a letter about AI but believes they have benefits. Think about assisted living. Robotic surgery. Wearable robotics for disabled people. Let’s not let that be overshadowed by the unethical application of robotics and AI in weapons. A new British drone is partly autonomous. Today the Ministry of Defence said it didn’t want weapons that could work without any human involvement. Others might like the idea. David Shukman, BBC News. The Ashes resumes tomorrow at Edgbaston, with the series finely balanced at 1-1, with three to play. But Australia’s dominant victory over England in the last Test at Lord’s has seized the initiative from the hosts. Here’s our sports correspondent, joe Wilson. When you look at the way they’ve decorated the stadium, it’s a good job Ian Bell kept his place in England’s team here. Warwickshire’s homegrown star was on community duty this week for Edgbaston’s charity. He even bats against school children with a certain flourish. But Bell was part of a grim capitulation the last time England faced Australia. Second innings at Lord’s, all out in just 37 overs, defeated by 405 runs. It takes a lot of mental strength, doesn’t it, to come back from that? It certainly does. There’s no doubt. I look in that dressing room now, and there’s a lot of tough cricketers in there. A lot of exciting guys with not a lot of natural ability. I think Australia proved exactly how you can turn things round and we’ve got to look at them as a great example we can do the same. But I think the confidence in the dressing room, yeah, even though it’s maybe hit a little bit, but still believes, if we play like we did in Cardiff, we can beat Australia and that’s the important thing. Well, that’s the point, the series still stands at 1-1 but, having grabbed the initiative, are Australia really going to hand it back? I think it’s important for us to run with this momentum, while we have it. Take confidence from Lord’s, but also remember how disciplined England were in Cardiff. We know how good an opposition they are. Australia’s captain speaks well to the media, measured, methodological, but nobody’s perfect. We walk out to bowl with no wickets. So we need to execute our skills like we did at Lord’s if we want to have sex... SUCCESS. LAUGHTER That’s not the first time that’s come out the wrong way! Well, Birmingham’s a broad minded city and the series so far has been quite friendly. joe Wilson, BBC News at the Ashes at Edgbaston. Here on BBC One it’s time for the news where you are. Have a good night. Welcome to BBC London News with me, Alex Bushill. The number of children being taken into care because their parents beat them is rising at an alarming rate, according to a London charity. It says that in just two months, it’s dealt with 30 cases where children have been taken away because of abuse in the home, more than the entire previous year. It’s led to calls for better education, particularly for African families, who charities say are far more likely to be affected. Ayshea Buksh reports.

The number of children being taken into care because their parents beat them is rising at an alarming rate, according to a London charity. It says that in just two months, it’s dealt with 30 cases where children have been taken away because of abuse in the home, more than the entire previous year. It’s led to calls for better education, particularly for African families, who charities say are far more likely to be affected. Ayshea Buksh reports. Adele is a single mum living in south-east London. She didn’t want to be identified because of her children. When her six-year-old daughter misbehaved, she would smack her, sometimes with a shoe. The school discovered bruises on her daughter’s body, and social services intervened. Soon after, Adele’s daughter and young son were taken into care. That was three years ago. Did you beat her often, or was it just occasionally? No, not often. I can say she doesn’t listen if you talk to her, so that’s why. Another parent I spoke to has also had her two children taken into care for the same reasons as Adele. Growing up in Nigeria, she says her father would hit her in the same way. To be a single mum is not easy. In our country, if my dad wants, he beats me. Even other people, too. If I do something bad, he would beat me. So when I do something bad, he beats me or is harsh with me, next time I won’t do it again. People USE B CBFIE. They use a broom. They use a belt. There’s another weapon which we call a horse whip, koboko. The director of a parenting charity based in Greenwich says they’ve seen an increase in African families contacting them. They advise parents in how to discipline without violence. We started with weeks of parental workshop. Then it teaches them how to manage their own emotion. The law currently regards smacking as reasonable chastisement. It’s allowed so long as the child is left with no injuries or marks, such as a bruise. just last month, the case was heard here at the High Court of a young boy who was beaten by his Indian father with a belt. The judge sitting was Mrsjustice Pauffley. She concluded that the harsh treatment of the boy did not merit the term ""physical abuse"", and she said that proper allowances should be made for a different cultural context. This one is with cable wire, that my mother did. Lydia was severely beaten as a child by her Nigerian parents in the 1970s and still has the scars. There was no intervention from her school or social services. I want to say there shouldn’t be a culturaljustification. It’s notjust an African problem, it’s a human-being problem. It cuts across racism. Wherever you’re from, it doesn’t matter, the problem is there. Another charity says there’s a disproportionate number of African children being taken away from their parents and they’ve been overwhelmed with cases recently, but they say their work is achieving results. Initially, they say, I have the right to beat my child. It is part of my culture. I see them shift from that to... I never knew I could do this. I never knew I could do that. It’s a genuine feeling of, you know, wow, if I’d known this, I wouldn’t have resorted to just smacking my children. So people can change. The current law on chastisement remains controversial. A government spokesperson said while they don’t condone violence towards children, parents should not be criminalised for issuing a mild smack. Adele, meanwhile, is still fighting to get her children home. Ayshea Buksh, BBC London News. For the first time, undercover policing is being publicly examined by a formal inquiry. It follows claims that Met spied on the family of the murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence, used the names of dead children to create fake identities, and had sexual relationships with women involved in campaign groups. june Kelly has more. The investigation into the murder of the black teenager Stephen Lawrence was marred by police failings. But it was only last year that it emerged that as his parents fought to bring his killers tojustice, undercover officers were gathering evidence on them. The same was happening to other grieving families. This will form part of the inquiry into undercover policing, but from Stephen’s father some reservations. It is a judge-led inquiry, butjust one person sitting down to make all the decisions. I would rather it was more than one person. The inquiry will also examine the behaviour of undercover officers like Bob Lambert, who had relationships with activists they were spying on. He had a son with one campaigner but abandoned the child and his mother. She finally learned the truth in 2012. She does not want to be seen. There is no circumstance where having sexual relationships in order to get information on a group, no way, whatever the group is, is it everjustified. It has ruined lives, OK? It took my son’s childhood. No-one is entitled to do that to anyone. It was the infiltration of protest groups which revealed the scale of secret policing and the role of a now disbanded Scotland Yard unit, the Special Demonstration Squad. The inquiry will hear from its former officers. I was a grown adult when I did the work, and I felt I was doing the correct thing. With the benefit of hindsight, I should never have gone anywhere near that sort of work. The inquiry will stretch beyond undercover operations in campaign groups to the use of undercover policing in serious crime. That’s it from me, so I’ll say goodbye and hand you over to Wendy with the weather. Good evening. If it is a bit nippy out there at the moment, it should be a little bit warmer, that is what we are going to get later this week, but in the meantime a breeze blowing from the west or north westerly direction, pushing in showers, and we might see one or two further through the night. A lot of dry, clear weather, through the night. A lot of dry, clearweather, in clear weather, in the Costa crunchy side single figures for a time, a nip in the air first thing for the commute. -- in the countryside. Through the day, still this north-westerly flow pushing in a few further showers towards the evening that could be a bit on the heavy side. In sunny spells, 21 degrees, but feeling a little on the cool side for the time of year. The month started as a record-breaker, 37 degrees. It is finishing distinctly average, 22 degrees, and you can see that on the outlook. Fine and dry weather out of the next few days into the weekend, the temperature picking up as the wind changes direction, 24 degrees by Sunday. jon Hammond has the national forecast. Hopefully my colleague in your region has given you some reason for optimism, and we could do with it! Cast your mind back, we began the month with record heat. Today, I’m afraid, with persistent rain, some places struggling to get much higher than 13 or 14 degrees. Still raining across the heart of Scotland and the Borders, further south thundery downpours this evening, flashes of lightning into the night. By tomorrow morning, most of the persistent rain will break into showers, so some drier spells, in fact some places are enjoying a bright and breezy day, but still some sharp showers coming down on that cool north-westerly breeze, but a better day across central and southern parts. Temperature is not as low, but still the wrong side of normal. Showers in lines through parts of northern England, Wales, one or two affecting the test match perhaps. Some of the best of the weather across south Wales and south-west England. We mightjust squeaked into the low 20s in one or two places across the south-east. Tomorrow night will be mighty cold, the Glens of Scotland and Northern Ireland close to freezing, and even in some further south rural spots well down into single figures. Thursday will be a nice day for most of us, showers across eastern counties, showers approaching Northern Ireland, but in between more sunshine, feeling a bit more like it, and that continues into Friday across more southern and eastern areas. After a cold start, some sunshine to look forward to, but for Northern Ireland and western Scotland, another weather front means breezes and a showery rain developing. 13 or 14 there, 20 or 22 in the sunshine further south and east. That showery weather does not really make it much further southwards, in fact the yellow takes over, a hint of orange across southern areas for a time through the weekend. At long last, a bit of warmth, some sunshine, but rain clouds will be looming out west again later in the weekend. Beyond that, very uncertain, but what element of the jigsaw could be this cluster of rain clouds just to the west of Florida. How that has a ",,

Eurozone leaders offer a third bailout to Greece as long as they sign up to tough new reforms this week. Today we only had one objective - to reach an agreement.

And the campaign to match London’s diverse young workforce with the rightjobs in the right businesses. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. After 17 hours of talks in Brussels, Eurozone leaders have reached an agreement to keep Greece in the Euro. They are offering a third bail-out in return for tough new reforms that have to become law in Greece by Wednesday. The cost of the bail-out is huge, £61 billion, but so too is the price the Greeks are now paying - they face years of even more and tougher austerity. The German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, said the road ahead would be long and arduous. Tim Wilcox is in Athens. Here in Athens, reaction to the deal has been one of relief and anger. The Minister for reform said it was clear the Europe of posterity had one and the eurozone deal had been forced on the people of Greece. It came after marathon talks in Brussels, from where Chris Morris reports. It was a long night of waiting after months of fruitless negotiations and it was billed as the last chance. There was the teak and frustration, and also a sense that this was a big moment for the eurozone. Shortly before 9am, after plenty of swings of mood, European leaders urged to proclaim that a deal had been done. In this compromise there are no winners and no losers. I don’t think the Greek people have been humiliated, and I don’t think that the other Europeans were losing face. It is a typical European arrangement. Many people might take issue with that. The Greek government has been forced to accept plenty of measures it had promised to reject. Its supporters may yet regard the demands imposed upon it as vindictive, tantamount to Greece losing fiscal independence. The end of the summit was not marked by celebration, more a mood of weary relief that the deal was finally done. But while political leaders will trumpet this as a sign that the eurozone can overcome serious obstacles, critics will see it as proof that the idea of European solidarity has strict limits. It was Germany that took the toughest line, suspicious, like many others, that Greece will ever implement the reforms it has signed up to. Eventually, even they declared themselves satisfied. TRANSLATION: I can recommend the start of negotiations with my full conviction. They reflect against the principles according to which we have been saving the euro, solidarity of the member states and responsibility of the country which needs to be saved. Represented here by a radical left-wing Prime Minister who has surprised the rest of Europe with his willingness to go to the brink. They should put the prospect of receiving the eurozone on the back burner for now, but some of the concessions it has made will be painful. TRANSLATION: The deal is difficult but we have prevented the pursuit of a transfer of public property abroad. We have prevented the plan of financial asphyxiation and the collapse of the financial system. And he’s going home with the prospect of a third bailout, future measures the debt restructuring and a plan to help save Greek banks. He now leads Parliament in Athens to cooperate quickly in the next three days. Greece and Europe cannot rest easilyjust yet. The head of the European Commission chief, jean-Claude juncker, said the risk of Greece leaving the eurozone had been averted, but there were no winners and no losers. So what does this mean for Greece? Our economics correspondent Andy Verity has been looking at the details. Alexis Tsipras was not the one leading last night’s conversation, and it showed. He has been forced to accept terms including those of a body year spent years attacking, the International Monetary Fund, headed by Christine Lagarde. Greece has given up control of its own economic future. What does Greece have to do? It will have to enact laws by Wednesday imposing VAT on more goods and removing exemptions from, for example, remote islands. It would need to cut pensions upfront in a comprehensive reform of the pension system. If Greece misses its target to get the budget into surplus will be automatic budget cuts and it will have to sell off assets, including electricity networks, ports and airports, and the money will go into a separate fund. Greece will not get to decide how it is spent. The first 25 billion euros will pay back the cost of recapitalising the stricken banks. Approximately 25 billion that will be needed for recapitalisation is repaid, then the remaining funds coming from the fund will be used for 50% to bring down debt even more and 50% can be invested in Greece by the Greek government. What Greece is getting for that is a third bailout, enabling it to borrow up to 86 billion euros more. 10 billion would be released immediately to stop the banks running out of cash, and there would be another 35 billion euros on top of that from existing European programmes to boost investment and job creation. The deal says Europe will consider the possibility of debt relief, such as taking longer to pay back all the money it has already borrowed. Mr Tsipras now has to convince the world and the Greek parliament he was right to accept terms much harsher than the stood Greece rejected in the referendum eight days ago. And his key demand of debt relief remains just a maybe. Germany was central to the negotiations, it was a particularly bad tempered session before the deal was signed. jenny Hilljoins us from Berlin. The Germany get everything it wanted? -- did Germany get? To an extent, yes. The language from Angela Merkel was pretty tough, she said what we have lost is the valuable currency of trust and credibility, and that is what people here in Germany are still talking about this morning. Chancellor Merkel is under huge amount of domestic pressure. Senior MPs within her own party strongly and openly oppose funding a third bailout deal for Greece. They’re in mind that Chancellor Merkel, like a number of other leaders, has to get Parliamentary approval before she gets mandated to even negotiate this deal, we have got huge sympathy with the plight of the Greek people that we have very little trust in the Greek government. What happens next? In Germany they are waiting for Greece to try to get those reforms through its own parliament. Chancellor Merkel has made it clear she will not recall any of her MPs until that happens. Then there will be about. But no doubt about it, they are clear here in Germany they are maintaining a very tough line. Angela Merkel was asked in a press conference this morning, where is the Greek handwriting in this deal, where is the Greek voice? She said, the Greek handwriting is there, in the amount of money they are asking for. jenny, thank you very much. Alexis Tsipras, the Greek Prime Minister, returns to Athens today and has until Wednesday to get these measures through Parliament, the building just behind me. measures through Parliament, the buildingjust behind me. He has measures through Parliament, the building just behind me. He has told people he has the best possible deal and has avoided some of the harsher measures that they were trying to impose on Athens, but what do ordinary Greeks think? Mark Lowen has been finding out. Their politicians have been trading promises. A deal is done. But at what price? And exhausted nation lurching between crises waits to see what more sacrifices it must now make to keep its place in the Euro alive. We want to be in the eurozone, we want to pay taxes and all that. But we don’t want to feel strangled by very hard measures. TRANSLATION: I am unhappy with the deal, it is a big mistake. It will be a social explosion. I had hoped in Tsipras but now it is gone. Whoever said a week is a long time in politics mightjust have had Alexis Tsipras in mind. Remember the referendum and his note to blackmail? Hejust referendum and his note to blackmail? He just said yes to more austerity. Last night, protesters gathered, talking of betrayal. Alexis Tsipras will face a serious backlash here at home, criticised by his voters for a climb-down he will be slammed by opponents for accepting harsher measures because of the delay. His own party could now split. A deal to save Greece could just think it’s Prime Minister. Across social media, hostility. #ThisIsACoup trending on Twitter both in and out of Greece. A sense that democracy its alp has been hit here where it was born. In Parliament there will be heated debate, maybe a Cabinet reshuffle with the hard left of the Government likely to defect. TRANSLATION: We don’t try to make this deal look better than it is. We are sailing it clearly, this deal is not us, we don’t believe in it. -- clearly, this deal is not us, we don’t believe in it. -- selling it clearly. I can’t tell you it will pass or it will be easy. And so, for the eurozone, perhaps, a sigh of relief, but with years of hardship ahead, when will Greece breathe again? Our economics editor Robert Preston is alongside me. We are not out of the woods yet? Not by a long chalk. This rescue deal has to go through the Greek parliament. There is absolutely no guarantee that the parliament will accept bailout proposals, that the Greek people a few days ago, brand to be rejected. It is the case that if the parliament were to reject what was on the table, we will be back into Euro exit potential crisis. So I suppose the likelihood is that staring into the abyss they will accept it, but that deal is not done. Secondly, I havejust interviewed a senior Greek Minister. She told me she is convinced that as a result of the current closure of the banks and the austerity being forced back on Greece that the Greek economy will tumble back into a serious recession, a contraction, she says, of 3%. Finally, the Greek banks had been hoping that the capitulation of Alexis Tsipras would be rewarded by the European Central Bank with a bit more emergency lending to the banks. Today, just now, we have heard there will be no more right now emergency lending, which means these banks will remain closed until at least Wednesday night, which is when we will hear will, we will know whether Parliament has backed the deal. Thank you. Interestingly, this week sees the Government having to pay its public sector workers, a significant number of the workforce, so it will be interesting to see how they get about that. These are the latest reactions to the development so far, but for now, back to London. Thank you. Doctors have called for a 20% tax on sugary drinks. The British Medical Association says a third of the British population will be obese by 2030 or unless something is done to change people’s diets. The BMA says a tax would help and money raised should be used to subsidise fresh fruits and vegetables. In says the doctors is to be advocates for a healthy environment. When it comes to food and drink it says the environment for many is unhealthy. The BMA report says poor diet leads to 70,000 premature deaths every year in the UK. A good place to start in tackling this would be a tax on sugary drinks, putting up the tax by at least 20%. The BMA says this would cut the number of obese people in the UK by 180,000. The evidence has been mounting against sugar in the last ten to 15 years. Many majorjournals have recognised studies which can show the adverse impact of a high sugar diet. The biggest problem is a lot of us are unaware of the amount of sugar that we are consuming on a daily basis. The government is coming under ever more pressure to reduce the harm caused by sugary drinks. Food and drink manufacturers say imposing an additional taxes not the answer. The real issue is it will not work. Wherever it has been tried in world, Europe Mexico, consumer demand returned to original patterns. We need an all embracing strategy to tackle obesity. Good nutritional educational, good physical activity and an attitude of calories in, carries out. Manufacturers say they are already cutting salt, saturated fat and calories from their products. The BMA say it is time for a tougher approach. While the Prime Minister agrees industry needs to go further to tackle obesity, his official spokeswoman has said he wants to continue to work with businesses and does not support a sugar tax. Our top story this lunchtime: After marathon talks in Brussels, eurozone leaders agree on a third bailout for Greece - as long as tough new laws are ratified by the Greek parliament this week. Still to come, we hear from Prince William on his newjob. Later on BBC London, How Churches, mosques and temples are filling the gap to help those in need. And using the soil beneath OUR feet to help a tide come in after 400 years in Essex. A number of flights at Heathrow were cancelled or delayed this morning, after a group of protestors cut through a perimeter fence and chained themselves together on a runway. They were campaigning against the possible expansion of Britain’s biggest airport. The runway was closed for nearly three hours. Andy Moore is at Heathrow. Airport was late opening this morning. Aircraft were taking off further down the runway. That runway is now open again. Disruption has been minimal. Nonetheless, cancellations and delays are ongoing, all because of this protest that started this morning. Surrounded by the emergency services and their vehicles, you canjust see some of the protestors lying on the tarmac under blue covers, chained together. Eventually they were lifted onto a trailer and with police keeping a good watch, driven away. After about six hours the protest was over. The demonstrators had taken their own pictures and video. No ifs, no buts, no third runway. They showed some protestors lying on the ground. One man dressed as a Polar Bear climbed on a tripod made from scaffolding poles. It was not until after eight o’clock that he was removed by the emergency services using a hydraulic lift. The demonstrators had got onto the runway by cutting through a perimeter fence. Their apparent ease in doing so raises questions about security. Plane Stupid is a well-known security. Plane Stupid is a well- known protest group that has been campaigning against expansion at Heathrow for some years. The group apologised to anybody who’s day they had ruined. They said their protest was aimed at anybody who flew frequently and unnecessarily. The southern runway remained open throughout the process. The reopening of the northern runway was delayed for about 20 minutes after its night-time shot down. Around 13 flights were cancelled. The airport says there could be further delays. About nine protestors have been arrested so far on charges of breaching aviation security. The airport will be reviewing that security to try and stop anything like this happening again.

Splits are emerging within the Labour party over how to respond to the benefit cuts announced by the government in last week’s budget. The acting leader, Harriet Harman, has said they should support some reductions in tax credits. Three of the four leadership contenders say that they don’t support her, as our political correspondent Chris Mason reports. What is Labour for? Where is it going? They are the questions the four candidates for the leadership are trying to answer. At a hustings event in Leamington this morning, three of them said stand-in leader Harriet Harman had got it wrong, endorsing cuts to welfare. We should oppose those changes. That is how Labour makes itself relevant. We should speak up for younger people. I think we can be credible and also say we are going to oppose the things that the Tories are doing, which will hit work and hit people’s incentives to work. The budget last week is brutal and anti-young and anti the poorest in Britain. I will oppose these changes. Only Liz Kendall was willing to say that Harriet Harman was onto something. I think Harriet was right to say we have two provide a credible alternative. People are said to us, we don’t trust you on money, we don’t trust you on welfare reform. If you are going to oppose things you have to put something else in its place. What did Harriet Harman say yesterday? Boiled down to this. Look at what voters said the election. They did not trust us on the economy. We have to listen to that and respond to that. We will not vote against the welfare bill. Those remarks mean it could be a sparky get-together when Labour MPs meet later. Those close to Harriet Harman say she was expressing an attitude, not policy position. That will be up to the next leader. As Labour leadership contenders set out their arguments, this row illustrates how disorientated by defeat the party still is. Two have been killed in an explosion at an industrial estate in Norwich. The emergency services were called to the scene at just after 9am this morning. o’clock this morning spoke of a loud bang and a large fire in Helston. The emergency services were called to Hartford engineering, a company on the estate which makes buckets and attachments for diggers. Two men at the scene died. One was in his 50s, another in his 20s. Both are believed to have been working in the company. Working in the area where the fire was. Nobody else needed medical treatment, we are told. The area around the estate is closed off and is likely to be closed off until tomorrow. That is so the Fire Services and of the Health and Safety Executive can carry out an investigation to establish what happened. The man who called police to tell them a car had crashed off a motorway near Stirling, says he feels guilty he didn’t follow it up. Police Scotland failed to respond to the call. Two people were left in the car undiscovered for three days. One died at the scene, the other died in hospital yesterday. Kevin Keane is outside police headquarters in Stirling. The man who made the call is feeling terrible after nothing happened after his phone call? Yes, he spoke to us anonymously today because he is concerned about the feeling on social media that he should have done more to savejohn Yuill and Lamara Bell. He says he shares that sense of guilt but was told by the officer on the phone that the crash would be investigated. He said he made the call at about half past 11 on Sunday morning of last week to report there was a vehicle at the bottom of an embankment on the night motorway. He said it would not have been visible from the motorway but he had spotted it from a side road. He said the call handler was not dismissive, handled the call professionally and gave the impression he knew what he was doing. But he said he became increasingly concerned over subsequent days that the car was still there and there was no evidence of any police tape. Today he said he feels left -- let down. What have Police Scotland said? More pressure is being put on the Chief Constable here now that two independent enquiries are underway. One of them into that: The Sunday. But one of them is much more wide ranging. The Chief Constable saying today that he is keen to learn any necessary lessons from the investigations. Scotland’sjustice investigations. Scotland’s justice Secretary investigations. Scotland’sjustice Secretary and First Minister have given him their backing. He insists this is not the time frame to go. ~ I believe the right thing for me to do is to stay, to get through this process, to get through this tragic event and the series of events that follow it, and to see what can be done to fix the situation. That latest inquiry from Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary in Scotland is likely to be the one that reports first. It will look at any potential systemic failures. If there is a wide-ranging consequence of this one, that is the report to watch. Prince William has begun work as an air ambulance pilot. He’s now based at Cambridge airport and will be flying with the East Anglian Air Ambulance service. Our royal correspondent, Nicholas Witchell, joins us now. Yes, he has passed the exams to become a civilian air ambulance pilot. And at seven o’clock this morning, feeling a little nervous, he said, he reported for his first day of duty in his newjob. He describes it as a worthwhile and valuable job and for the foreseeable future piloting an air ambulance helicopter will be his primary occupation. It is clearly regards having a job such as this as both a judy and necessity. For me it is an important point to be grounded. Ifeel doing For me it is an important point to be grounded. I feel doing a job like this really helps with grounding the core of what I am trying to become. What is that? What are you trying to become? Very good question! I think just trying to be a good guy, trying to do what you can and trying to be a decent individual. All those sorts of things. Qualities in people you would want to be associated with. Doing a job such as this clearly matters to William a great deal. But it does mean his royal role will have to take second place. That seems to suit him. At some point there will be a lot more pressure and responsibility from the other side of my life. At the moment I’m iÂÂÂUÂÂ side of my life.

Time for a look at the weather- here’sjohn Hammond. It is pretty dreary as there for many. Leaden skies up and down week. Briefly it will turn warm with some sunshine but as we end the week, some blustery winds.

It is brightening up in the East. Generally staying rather cloudy. For Northern Ireland and Scotland things picking up. We have had rain across Scotland. Things should dry up with brightness developing from the West. As we go through the night it stays cloudy and murky in the southern half of the UK.

A reminderof the A reminder of the main stories, and bailout plan has been agreed for Greece as long as tough measures are ratified by the end of the week. Now on BBC One, it is time for the news when you are. Good afternoon, I’m Asad Ahmad. Phone scams which could be raising money for extremist groups through preying on the elderly and vulnerable are being highlighted by police, who are concerned about the rising number of cases. It’s been suggested that one of the reasons for the increase is because banks have tightened their own security, which has made criminals focus on the rest of us. Our home affairs correspondent Nick Beake has more on this. Asa As a respected chemist, Doctor Roberts Sykes travelled to more than 100 countries. But it was a highly plausible scam which targeted him at home that cost him thousands of pounds. They asked me if I would go to the bank and get some money, but not to doubt the bank why because they thought bank staff were also involved in it. -- not to tell the bank. It was convincing? Ifeel an utter complete idiot I fell for it. We are just giving up some leaflets... This morning police were explaining to residents in the city of London that phone scams are on the rise. In London last year 1940 incidents were reported to the action Ford Centre. That means five Londoners were targeted every day. This sort of crime tripled across the UK in 2014, with victims losing £29 million. Phone scams are nothing new, but now it is being cases, extremist groups are using the technique to raise money so that they can get to Syria. Counterterrorism officers say they have uncovered and large-scale fraud and later this month 12 men from in and around London will appear in court. Increasingly scammers claim they are ringing from the police or a bank saying a debit or credit card needs to be replaced. Victims are asked to ring the number on the back of their card. But the fraudster has not hung up and keeps the line open post up victims are then tricked into revealing their PIN number. Finally, a bogus career comes and takes apart, leaving the fraudsters free to withdraw the cash. Police believe the rise is because banks have tightened up their own security so the criminals are targeting the victims directly. I can make it crystal clear that banks and the police will never call you and ask for your personal financial information all get you to reveal personal password or PIN numbers over the phone. ",,

Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at 6pm. After months of talks and missed deadlines a deal has been struck to keep Greece within the Eurozone. Much crucial detail has yet to be agreed but the immediate prospect of Greece going bust in the worst crisis to hit the Eurozone has been averted. The EU has agreed to supply a short-term bridging loan to keep the country solvent and allow the banks to reopen. In return, Greece’s parliament has to agree key financial reforms demanded by European creditors on Wednesday. And longer term, an agreement has been reached ‘in principle’ to start negotiations on a bailout - Greece’s third - of 86 billion euros. Our first report tonight is from our Europe Editor, Katya Adler. It was a long night of waiting, with plenty of swings of mood. Eurozone leaders were fractious and divided. Their negotiations tough and seemingly endless. This was built as the last chance of a deal on Greece but don’t be fooled by the smiles, the Greek Prime Minister had very few friends here. Trust in his government is at an all-time low following months of backtracking and insults. After 17 hours of arguments, the French president was key to a compromise, for the good of Europe, notjust Greece, he said. TRANSLATION: Today was a long negotiation but above all an historic decision because if Greece had left the Eurozone what would have been said? That the Eurozone wasn’t able to ensure its integrity and solidarity? The Eurozone would have gone backwards when it needs to go forwards. But conditions imposed on the Greeks are harsh, their Prime Minister had promised an end to what he calls credited mediation, he knows that he will struggle to sell this deal at home. The dealer is difficult, he said, but we’ve avoided financial asphyxiation and the collapse of the financial system. We fought as hard as we could. What happens now? As a trust building exercise the Greek parliament is expected to pass the 80, pension and tax reforms by Wednesday. -- 80, pension and tax reforms by Wednesday. -- VAT. Eurozone finance ministers are working out an interim agreement to keep the country afloat from actually were the tombs of the new bailout are agreed. The bailout is expected to be for about 80 billion euros over three years, starting late summer or early autumn if those involved can agree. There are a lot of it is involved. No glorious victory for Greece or its Eurozone partners, the emerged bleary eyed this morning with the message we did it but remember the agreement isjust a nod to sitting down at a later date to hammer out the details. Before that the Greek parliament must pass -- the details. Before that the Greek parliament must pass -- pass harsh deal and other parliaments must agree to fund it. The Germans aren’t keen for example. And then Greece’s crippling debt, reducing fat is on the back burner again. crippling debt, reducing fat is on the back burneragain. So the back burner again. So today’s agreement doesn’t solve the crisis long-term and scars remain between the Eurozone countries, hardline Germany was close to walking out of talks overnight. Angela Merkel is now on board, just. TRANSLATION: The situation is tense so it’s in everyone’s interests to make the next steps work. If the Greek parliament does its bit to trust can be regained. What leaders wanted more than anything here was to restore trust in the wider Eurozone and there, and victory has been achieved. After months of speculation, talk of Greece falling out of the single currency has gone. The head of the European Commission jean-Claude juncker said the deal is a ""compromise"" in which there are ""no winners and no losers"". But many Greeks are angry at the agreement their government has reached - just a week after they voted against the bailout deal in a referendum. But as our Chief Correspondent Gavin Hewitt explains, for others, the deal is seen as a lifeline. This Athens neighbourhood supported Alexis Tsipras in his stand against authority. They woke up to a deal that kept Greece in the Euro but here, more bewilderment than celebration. TRANSLATION: The country cannot bear these reform measures. It’s going to become even more poor. You can see for yourself it used to be better before. She had supported the radical left-wing party, series, believing it would say No to further cuts. TRANSLATION: I believed in sinister, I voted for them. Sinners and betrayed its friends and its ideas. It did a 180 degrees turn -- friends and its ideas. It did a 180 degrees turn -- believed in Syriza. Elsewhere in the capital the mood was different, Greece had secured its future in Europe. We are happy because we think this will bring stability to the country. We want to be in the Euro and now we are 100% sure we are with the Europeans and I feel much more secure and relieved now. But the dealer ‘s controversial, the government has to place is that worth up to 50 billion euros in a special fund to be privatised. It will be managed by Greece and supervised by outsiders. Even some Cabinet ministers struggle to accept this. There was forced agreement, tremendous political pressure, and the threat of the death of the economy due to the closure of the banks. Did Greece surrender? No, we survived. The minister said the Europe of austerity had one. The Greek Prime Minister has arrived back in Athens. His next challenge, to get parliament to agree to the new measures by Wednesday and so unlock negotiations towards a third bailout. Almost certainly a raft of new measures, the tax increases and pension reforms will be agreed by the Parliament but the Prime Minister will need the support of other parties, raising questions as to whether, in the long term, these measures will be fully implemented. At least we will have the potential for confidence to return but this will take time and a lot will depend on the banking sector and how quickly banks will reopen. Although there is widespread release that the country is staying in the Euro, many say too much sovereignty has been surrendered to -- widespread belief. Our economics editor Robert Peston is in Athens now, Robert - the basis of an agreement but has either side got the better deal here? This has happened after weeks and months of talks! There are no winners. The only question is who is the biggest loser. If you look at the Greeks, they are back in recession, quite a serious recession, also the employment minister told me today. -- recession, also the employment minister told me today. -- or so he told me. This is because the banks have been closed, Greek people can’t access their money, companies can’t be financed and restrictions on the banks are likely to stay in place for weeks, so ministers tell me. The alternative, tumbling out the euro, that would have wiped out savings and killed companies, it might have been worse but make no mistake, Greeks will continue to be impoverished for months, possibly years. What of the Eurozone? Eurozone government heads have conceded the notion that Greek debts must be made more sustainable. That means that Eurozone taxpayers face between 15 and 18 billion euros of losses on disguised write-offs of those loans. I think that Eurozone governments will try to hide those losses but they are real. Two other things, big reputational damage to Eurozone leaders, perceived to be taking a country and Prime Minister begging for help over the last couple of days. One final import and development of the last couple of days, the German minister and others considered that a Greek rescue might have required temporary exit from the Euro. That was a big moment because it is said to the world, the euro may not be forever, despite the protestations of Eurozone leaders that this is their big permanent project. Thank you. The acting Labour leader, Harriet Harman, has backed down in the Has sought to defuse a row in her party about whether to support government benefit cuts as announced in the budget last week. Three of the four contenders for the Labour leadership say they would oppose the plans. Our deputy political editor, james Landale, is in Westminster for us, what more can you tell us? In the wake of its defeat at the election Labour has grappled with a dilemma, should it change by reflecting the views of voters in saying that, we understand why we lost, or stick to its guns and offer a distinctive opposition to government spending programmes and avoid accusations that it’s selling out to the opposition? A very lively, passionate debate, taking place above me at a meeting of Labour MPs now, with Harriet Harman in the hot seat. They are the low paid workers and families facing cuts to their benefits. Cuts they might have imagined the Labour Party would oppose but the party is divided over government welfare reforms, a division that goes to the heart of the debate of what kind of opposition Labour should be and what kind of leader it should choose. The party’s acting leader Harriet Harman said Labour shouldn’t automatically oppose all the governments welfare changes. But today three of those hoping to replace her as actual leader told BBC audience the party couldn’t endorse Conservative cuts. I think it’s right to cut tax credits because they make people better off in work. They give that incentive to work. We should oppose those changes, that’s how Labour makes itself relevant and we should speak up younger people. The budget last week was brutal, anti-young people and anti-the poorest in Britain, I will oppose these changes. But I got upset them was the announcement by Harriet Harman on the weekend that Labour wouldn’t oppose the plans to reduce the cap on how much welfare a family can get and to cut child tax credits in the future for larger families. just one leadership contender rallied to her cause. Harriet was right to say we have to provide a credible alternative. People said, we don’t trust you and many under welfare reform. If we are to oppose things we must put something else in its place because if we carry on making the same arguments as we’ve done over the last five years will get the same result. Here it is, ten o’clock, and we are saying that the Conservatives are the largest party. This welfare row goes to the heart of the debate in labour as to how it responds to election defeat. Today Harriet Harman insisted that the party would still oppose cuts to tax benefit, and student grants. Bid if we oppose everything we will succeed on nothing. We must also bear in mind that we didn’t get elected not because people love the Tories all love David Cameron but because they didn’t trust us on the economy and welfare. For some Labour MPs the row reflects the inevitable tensions of the defeated party getting to grips with opposition. For others it shows that Labour is electing its next leader, not necessarily the next Prime Minister. Two people have died in a suspected explosion at an industrial estate in Norwich. Norfolk Police said the incident took place just after nine this morning. The men, one aged in his 50s, the other in his 20s, are thought to have both worked at the premises. David Cameron says Britain should invest in more drones, spy planes and special forces, to counter the threat from so-called Islamic State. The Prime Minister, visiting RAF bases in Lincolnshire, said he was ‘absolutely determined’ the armed forces had the means to deal with what he described as ‘the battle of our generation’. The head of Police Scotland has said he won’t resign despite the criticism following the death of a couple who lay in a crashed car for three days after it was first reported to the force. 25-year-old Lamara Bell died in hospital yesterday, her partnerjohn Yuill, died at the scene of the crash on the M9 near Stirling on Sunday. Lorna Gordon is outside Police Scotland’s headquarters, The man who first called the police has been speaking to the BBC. What has he had to say. That individual, speaking anonymous, gave more details of the call he made to the police. He said the officer took his call seriously and sounded like he knew what he was doing and he was not dismissive. He said he assumed when he saw the car at the side of the motorway a day or two later that the police were dealing with the call, the car was awaiting recovery. We now know that was not the case. It took a second call from a different member of the public 72 hours after the crash for it to be investigated. The police force here in Scotland have come under scrutiny as a result of this. Perhaps a measure of the pressure they have been facing, the fact that they were interviews apologising for the force’s feeling. There were There was a second round of interviews today. I don’t want anyone thinking I’m the sort of person I will never 9ÂÂ I’m the sort of person I will never go, if I come to the conclusion that I should resign, then I will resign. I don’t believe that is the case at the time. The organisation needs leadership and I’m providing that leadership and have done for three years and will continue to do so. I am not sure the pressure on him will ease. He has the support of Scottish government, but he is facing criticism from opposition politicians. They question whether he has the support of his own police officers. They point to what they see as problems with the centralisation process of the force here in Scotland. That though all for a later date. Now the focus is on thor theic tragic crash and there are two independent investigations into that now ongoing. Thank you. Our top story this evening: A deal is done to keep Greece in the Eurozone, but much crucial detail has yet to be agreed. And still to come: Tiger Woods talks exclusively to the BBC and says he still has what it takes to win. On BBC London. The campaign to match London’s diverse young workforce with the rightjobs in the right businesses. Described as mini-Messi after the world’s greatest male football player, fresh from the Women’s World Cup, we hear from Chelsea ladies latest signing. Doctors have called for a new tax on sugary drinks to tackle obesity and diabetes. The British Medical Association says there should be a levy imposed of at least 20% with poor diets causing around 70,000 premature deaths each year. It suggests the money raised could subsidise the cost of fresh fruit and vegetables. Downing Street has responded that taxation is the wrong way to tackle the obesity crisis. Our Health Editor Hugh Pym looks at the arguments. Deliveries of sugary soft drinks keep on coming and the debate on the health impact is gaining momentum. Lunchtime at a school in Wiltshire, drinks with added sugar are not offered to pupils, but they can bring them in with packed lunches. This group is one that doctors want to get the message about the dangers of too much sugar. I asked pupils what they thought of the debate and the idea of a tax on sugary drinks. I believe we have made the wrong decision and chosen to drink sugary drinks. Steps need to be taking. Taxing more money nor the the drinks is stupid, because I’m having to play more for something that I’m already controlled about. People will be out and about and pick up the first drink they see and it is usually full of sugar. The World Health Organisation recommends a maximum of six tea spoons of sugar a day. There are more than eight in this can of coca cola and this bottle of rye bee that has more than 12 tea spoons. I would say that sugary drinks should be described as mini-health time bombs. Consumption ofjust one per day is associated with increasing the risk of diabetes. So we are all vulnerable to the effects of excess sugar. But manufacturers say a tax isn’t the answer. Wherever it has been tried, in Mexico and Europe it has not worked, consumer demand has risen. The way to tackle obesity is with balanced diets and proper nutritional education. Sugar is becoming a big political issue and NHS chiefs say government intervention may be required, but the industry argues that is not necessary and it can be relied on to cut sugar content. Later an official advisory group will publish guidelines and that will keep the debate bubbling along. A former Ukip MEP has been sentenced to five years in prison for fraudulently claiming expenses from the European Parliament. Ashley Mote - who is 79 - over claimed by nearly half a million pounds. The judge at Southwark Crown Court said he was thoroughly dishonest and a hypocrite for defrauding an institution he himself had criticised for being corrupt. 22 flights were cancelled and others delayed at Heathrow Airport this morning after a group of protestors cut through a perimeter fence and got onto the runway. The activists chained themselves together- closing part of the northern runway for nearly three hours. They were campaigning against a possible third runway at Britain’s biggest airport. Nine people were arrested. Golf, and the Open championship begins this Thursday at St Andrews. Already there is the former world number one and three time winner of the tournament - Tiger Woods. Form and fitness have deserted the American in recent years following damaging publicity about his private life. But in an exclusive interview, he told our Sports Editor Dan Roan that he still believes he can win the sport’s oldest major. For over a decade, Tiger Woods was sport’s biggest star with 14 Majors and a personal fortune. But then came a public fall from grace and a dramatic decline. Remarkable as it may seem, he is preparing for the Open ranked 241st in the word. He said his priorities have changed. How tough has it been? How do you deal with playing worse than you would expect to play? It is harder now, because I don’t have as much time to devote to the game and practicing. My kids are the most important thing in my life. When I was younger I could practice 14 hours a day. I drop golf to be with them. When you see your world ranking not what it could be, some may say how does he deal with that? It is putting in perspective what is the most important thing. When I was younger, it was golf. But my kids are the most important thing in my life. 18 years ago he started his era of dominance and seemed invincible. But then came scandal in his private life and a public confession. I was unfaithful. I his private life and a public confession. Iwas unfaithful. I had affairs. I cheated. Woods refuses to talk about that period, but there has been no Majors since, but battles with form and fitness and some of the worst performances of his career. I have never seen a professional do that. You have had to suffer, is that how you put it? You have to if you’re going to make changes you have to take steps back first. It will take work and patience. You will get in? Yes eventually. Would you win? Absolutely. You believe that? Absolutely. Tiger Woods knows how to win here. But those days seem a long time ago. But such is his stature in the game he remains the star attraction. How long do you think you will play for? As far as I can feel like I’m competitive and win tournaments. I’m not going to play forever and one that plays at 70. My bodyis forever and one that plays at 70. My body is good. I’m just not as... What do you call it? Wiry as I used to be. Nine years after Woods last won the Open, golf is struggling to retain popularity, but a Tiger back in the hunt could be a turning point for the sport and its fallen star. Prince William has begun work as an air ambulance pilot. He’s now based at Cambridge airport and will be flying with the East Anglian Air Ambulance service. Our Royal Correspondent, Nicholas Witchell was there as he took off for his first shift. just want to say very, very happy to be here. First day - nerves! It’s a job he’s chosen to do, which is hugely important to him - working shifts as an air ambulance pilot, something William regards as both a duty and a necessity. For me, it’s also a really important point to be grounded and I feel doing a job like this really helps with grounding the core of what I’m sort of trying to become. What is that? What are you trying to become? That’s a very good question! I thinkjust, you know, trying to be a good guy, trying to do what you can and trying to be, you know, a decent individual, thoughtful. All those sorts of things, qualities in people that you would want to be associated with. His air ambulance role will be William’s primary occupation. His royal duties will take second place. That seems to suit him. At some point there’s probably going to be a lot of pressure and responsibility from my other side of my life. At the moment I’m juggling the two of them and a young family and I’m enjoying it and I like the challenge. But, yes, inevitably down the line, things will probably become a little bit more difficult for me to do that. And what of that young family? What impact has the arrival of Charlotte had? It’s been obviously fantastic and she’s been a little joy of heaven. At the same time, it is more responsibility, looking after two little ones, especially when George is around - he’s a little monkey! But it’s fantastic having a lovely family and I’m so thrilled and Catherine has been doing an amazing job as a mother and I’m very proud of her. They now have a son and a daughter, so any plans for more children? We have onlyjust had the second one! You never know what’s going to happen in the future. William, juggling family life and a dual sense of duty as a prince and as a pilot. Nicholas Witchell, BBC News, Cambridge Airport. Time for the weather now. Not great weather for his first day, was it? I think this week will be typical British summer, we have had grey and damp today, some sunshine to tempt you out, before something wetter and windier pushes in towards the end of the week. At the moment, it is that grey, damp misty weather. A bit of evening sunshine in the north and west and through the night it will turn clearer here. In England and Wales the low cloud will remain and another humid night. Further north it will be that fresher. Temperatures into single parts in rural parts of Scotland. But bright tomorrow. Any sunshine in Northern Ireland on the hazy side. Some sunshine further south, but it is a dividing line across the north of England into the Midlands. Not as wet as this morning unless you’re in Wales or South West England. The rain turns more persistent with mist and hill fog. Some rain further east. The Midlands northwards more sunshine. Some heavy showers in the Pennines and eastern parts of Scotland. But a lot of dry weather. Through Tuesday into Wednesday, we have the low cloud and drizzle. Some showers in the north. But generally the brighter weather will win through and probably the sunniest day of the week for many of you and not feeling too bad. Not a scorcher, but pleasant enough. The warmth builds in the south into Thursday. But some wet and windy weather arrives on Friday. Thank you. That is all for now. Goodbye from On the programme tonight. No to airport expansion.

The fact that we have sparked the discussion around expanding the airport and its effect on the climate around the world is choosing business and wealth over sustainability. They feel so strongly that they have gone to these lengths, putting business over climate change? Those protesters do not represent the majority of local residents and the communities around Heathrow. If you look at the airport cause Mac -- airport’s consultation, 84% were in favour of the expansion. People just want to get on, go on holiday, travel on business. 95% of the employable population have not yet set foot on a plane. Are we seeing people do that? But you are part funded by Heathrow as a group? We are, and we are funded by small businesses around the airport. They are unashamedly pro-Heathrow. Most residents around the airport do not share the actions are carried out today. Will you take a direct action again? Of course. It is an appropriate measure. It is successful. It was successful previously in bringing the idea of expanding the airport. I want to counterbalance this argument. I am from Hounslow and I know what the sentiment in Hounslow and this statistic that are put forward saying it will benefit the people is not a reality. By BR talking about people flying for the first time, most people are frequent flyers. On our Facebook page, we have had people supporting what you are saying about disagreeing with expansion, but not your tactics. We have to respect their diversity of tactics. Most of the civil liberties that we have our inalienable rights which have come from struggles like this. Is the third runway, if it goes ahead, and environmental price worth paying? Ido hope it goes ahead but I do not think you could he get out of context like that. Environmentally, it can be done and will have enormous community and economic benefits. Like you both very much indeed. ~ -- thank you. Coming up later. I will be live at Lambeth town Hall ahead of a crucial meeting. The friend of a man shot dead in a drive-by shooting in north London on Friday says he’s lucky to be alive after narrowly being missed by a volley of bullets. Erdogan Guzel was sitting with his friend when he was gunned down in Wood Green. A woman, who was also shot, is in hospital while the gunmen tonight remain on the loose. Sarah Harris reports. The community in Wood Green is still coming to terms with the shooting during last Friday’s rush-hour. Erdogan Guzel, who was A2, was sitting outside the bakery he co-owned with his friend when two men driving past in a car opened fire. I’m very lucky, Ijust dived. When I saw the gun, I just dived on the floor. His cousin dived on the floor. I don’t know if Erdogan dived or not. It took like nearly two or three seconds. After two or three seconds, they just drove away. First, we just looked at ourselves to see if something was wrong. Then we found out that Erdogan was on the floor. His EYES WEI’E opEIâ1. We said, are you OK? He didn’t talk to us. We touched his body. Nothing wrong with his front. But he was get shot from here. When we pulled him up, we saw the blood. A cafe Mr Guzel owned close to King’s Cross was also closed today out of respect for the father of two. A woman who was passing the shop in Wood Green was also hit and remains in hospital. Members of the Turkish community say Mr Guzel believed that an innocent person would get shot because of rival gangs in the area and they are calling on police to do more. Yes, they should. No-one is happy, and nobody is feeling safe. Especially the people doing business in this area. They do not feel safe. They want from the government or the police to sort out this problem. Nobody from the Met was available for interview today but they are appealing for help in their murder investigation. There continues to be a police presence here to reassure people but members of the Turkish community say they will not feel truly safe until these gunmen have been brought tojustice. A man has been found guilty of murdering his wife after a row escalated over him speaking to other women on Facebook. jamshaid Khan killed Milena Yulianova in Forest Gate 15 months after they got married. Khan told police his wife pulled a knife from behind her back during an argument and when he tried to disarm her, she was stabbed. But today a jury rejected his defence. Rail workers at one union have announced they will strike for 24 hours next month over plans to introduce a new night service. Last Thursday, four unions brought the Tube to a complete halt and caused travel chaos in the capital. Today, London Underground responded by saying it has made a fair and reasonable offer on pay and the introduction of the night Tube. Police are warning about a rise in the number of elderly and vulnerable people being targeted in cold-calling scams. They say they’re now dealing with more than 150 cases a month. It comes amid concerns that the tactic may be being used by some extremists to raise money. Our Home Affairs Correspondent, Nick Beake has more. As a respected chemist, Doctor Robert Sykes travelled to more than 100 countries. But it was a highly plausible scam which targeted him at home that cost him thousands of pounds. They asked me if I would go to the bank and get some money, but not to tell the bank why because they thought bank staff were also involved in it. It was convincing? I feel an utter, complete idiot. Ifell for it. We are just giving up some leaflets... This morning, police were explaining to residents in the city of London that phone scams are on the rise. In London last year, 1,940 incidents were reported to the ActionFraud Centre. That means five Londoners were targeted every day. This sort of crime tripled across the UK in 2014, with victims losing £29 million. Phone scams are nothing new, but now it is being claimed that, in some cases, extremist groups are using the technique to raise money so that they can get to Syria. Counterterrorism officers say they have uncovered a large-scale fraud and later this month 12 men from in and around London will appear in court. Increasingly, scammers claim they are ringing from the police or a bank saying a debit or credit card needs to be replaced. Victims are asked to ring the number on the back of their card. But the fraudster has not hung up and keeps the line open. Victims are then tricked into revealing their PIN number. Finally, a bogus courier comes and takes the card, leaving the fraudsters free to withdraw the cash. Police believe the rise is because banks have tightened up their own security so the criminals are targeting the victims directly. I can make it crystal clear that banks and the police will never call you and ask for your personal financial information or get you to reveal personal password or PIN numbers over the phone. Robert eventually got his money back but fears many others could fall prey to the same scam. A common concern among young people in London is how to get a good job. At the same time, businesses here say they’re looking for talent. Well, Karl Mercer has details of a new campaign which aims to bridge that gap by connecting a diverse young workforce with the rightjobs in the right business. In a room high above the Olympic Park, perhaps a glimpse of the future. Down below is the hard evidence of the growing demand for skills in the capital. It’s hoped this new scheme will match the talent of youngsters with the needs of industry. It’s really about spotting talent. It’s about finding young people that they wouldn’t normally get access to, not normally the people who would come through a graduate scheme, for instance. The aim is to get 8000 young people intojobs by 2020. People like Venetia Taylor, taken on by a tech firm called Decoded in east London. It’s been amazing. It’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Everyone should do it if they can get the chance. Sanna Shabir’s office is at one of the country’s biggest engineering firms. She’s almost a year into an apprenticeship. But she will stay at the firm to do a degree. Not something she ever planned. ~ I had not going into the finance sector. But I did not get a good insight into engineering. But I got to do that with an internship programme. We have a shortage of young engineers in our business. London needs big infrastructure. The industry needs engineers. The scheme has the layers biking, but City Hall is struggling to meet its own targets. -- is struggling to meet its own targets. -- may’s backing. 40,000 a year we are targets. -- may’s backing. 40,000 a yearwe are averaging. year we are averaging. just remind you that in previous years, they did for less.

Fresh from helping her country to World Cup bronze we meet the player who’s thought to be the most expensive woman in English football. Hundreds of residents from a south London housing estate are protesting outside their Town Hall this evening ahead of a meeting which will decide their future. Lambeth Council wants to demolish the estate in Tulse Hill and re-build. Let’sjoin Katharine Carpenter who’s got more on this story. The meeting will get underway at seven o’clock in the town Hall. There are plenty of local residents who are very concerned about this. It is expect did -- who are very concerned about this. It is expect did -- expected that the council will approve the demolition of Cressingham Gardens. The residents are opposed to it, saying they will before us out of our homes and communities. Why is the council so keen to do this virgin mark it is says it has 20,000 people on the waiting list and it wants to build 1000 new council homes. The plan is to demolish a 306 homes that are currently on the estate and rebuild them with an extra 158. But many of the local residents say that their houses are being run down to give the council an excuse to do it. The council say it is the most cursed effective way to do this. I asked a member of the council how they would convince people that they would be allowed back onto the estate? The onus is on us to stick to our word and make sure we are delivering a scheme that is viable and will do what we are saying we are going to do. Which is why we have spent so long working through the figures to make sure we know that for everyone who already lives there, the tenants get a like for like replacement home, overcrowded tenants get a home with enough bedrooms, they will be at council led rent levels for a lifetime and we have worked on ways to make sure the homeowners can st living there even though there are differences in value at the same time as increasing homes for localfamilies in need. Why do you not believe the council when you are told you get a better home, a better deal from this? The council has not made a single statement that has been true. They have lied about Holby blue. We know that the refurbishment is the cheapest option. We have had independent experts verify that. -- they have lied the whole way through. We know that most of these homes are going to buy to let landlords. All they are doing is demolishing the most affordable housing and giving back housing that is more expensive. Even council rents are going up. Thanks very much. As well as this protest here, the protesters do have one more thing up their sleeve. They are planning to have a judicial review into all of this. Thank you. She’s the player described by England women’s manager as his mini-Messi - the greatest player in men’s football. After helping England win a World Cup bronze medal, Fran Kirby signed for Chelsea Ladies for a fee believed to be a record for the women’s game - £60,000. Her new club is hoping to capitalise on the World Cup feelgood factor, as Chris Slegg reports. A peak TV audience of 2 million saw England women beat Germany but the first time ever to return from the World Cup as bronze medallists. Not quite so many were watching yesterday, but crowds for women’s Super League matches were up. There were new fans, people I had not seen before coming to games. To see them celebrate World Cup heroes in a way that I have another scene in my lifetime, it was a great need for women’s football. One of the standout moments for England in Canada was this all. 22 -year-old Fran has enjoyed a whirlwind week. There was a royal reception and a trip to Downing Street. As well as a change of clubs. Chelsea are believed to have paid £60,000. Ido not know if it was a record transfer fee. For me, it isjust a case of getting out onto the pitch and enjoying myself. Raheem Sterling is expected to join Manchester City £449 million. Women’s football wants to grow, but there is caution over chasing the riches of the men’s game. I would like to see that kind of money being slashed and round and people being changed so much. Women’s football provides a career for the players, but does not provide a pension for them. And I do not expect it to do so any time soon. Women’s football has every right to savour the moment what ever the future. It’s a major project to create Europe’s largest man-made nature reserve, using soil from tunnelling Crossrail. And today it’s taken a step forward. This weekend, the sea wall was breached on Wallasea Island in Essex to allow the tide to flow in for the first time in 400 years. Shaun Peel reports. Soon after sunrise, as the tide moved out, the diggers moved in. Their task, to create three breaches before sundown. Then the sea would be back to create a wild coastal landscape. This landscape has a kind of bleak otherworldliness about it, doesn’t it, but this is Essex. Over there, you can see the diggers starting to scrape away the sea wall, one of three breaches, today. Tonight, when the tide comes in, if I were to be standing here, I would be up to my eyes in sea water. This entire area will be flooded, bringing Wallasey Island back to how it was 400 years ago. I’m a dour Yorkshireman but even I am getting excited today! It really is an amazing day both for me and the project, and for the RSPB as a whole, it is our most complex project reaching a milestone. It is possible because of a partnership between the owners of the island - the RSPB - and Crossrail. Three million tonnes of earth excavated from the underground tunnels has been shipped to Wallasea to bring the island to 1.5 metres above sea level and carve out a new landscape. As a team, we will be able to look at the completed project and think we were part of that, we helped to deliver it and it will be a fantastic achievement, absolutely. This is how it looked this morning before high tide, the first phase of the Wallasea island project completed. There is more to do but, within three years, the area will be established as a salt marsh supporting 50,000 wintering birds. Build it, and they shall come. Let’s get a check on the weather with Sara Thornton. Some good news in the weather for the week ahead. It has been a disappointing and cloudy start. We will continue with that into tomorrow. He is the cloud. It brought us some rain. For the next day or so, we will continue with cloudy conditions. But temperatures will stay well up. 16 or 17 Celsius. A cloudy and at times damp start tomorrow morning. Not heavy rain, but some drizzle coming through. The odd bright spell. Temperatures where they should be for the time of year. As we go through tomorrow, we continue to see an area of low pressure moving towards us. So again, tomorrow night, outbreaks of rain to contend with. Feeling fairly humid as well. Temperatures of 16 or 17 Celsius. Some improvement on Wednesday. The cloud will start to them and break a little. -- Wednesday. The cloud will start to them and break a little. -- too thin. On Thursday, still low-pressure in the south-west, but this window will develop and bring some warm air from the continent saw temperatures doing better at the end of the week. We might keep that until Friday, but cool and windy for the weekend. Now the main headlines. After months of talks and missed deadlines, a deal has been struck to keep Greece within the Eurozone. Much crucial detail has yet to be agreed but the immediate prospect of Greece going bust in the worst crisis to hit the Eurozone has been averted. The acting Labour Leader, Harriet Harman, is meeting the party’s MPs this evening amid mounting criticism of her support for some of the Government’s benefit cuts announced in last week’s budget. 13 climate-change activists have been arrested after chaining themselves to railings on the north runway at Heathrow Airport. The demonstrators’ actions caused some flight delays and cancellations. More on the day’s stories on our website. And I’ll be back later during the ten o’clock news.

And they’re feeling the pressure. I can’t even believe I’m in the semis. We do have some talented individuals. I love it. Unfortunately, we have to whittle them down. Tonight at Ten: Greece gets a new bailout, but only if it signs up to tough reforms within days. The draft deal struck by Eurozone leaders, after 17 hours of talks, paves the way for a third bailout in five years. Trust has been to restored. Those responsible in Greece must take responsibility to implement everything we have decided here. But the Greeks have had to agree cuts that are even sharper than those rejected in a recent referendum. We’ve struggled all the way to the end to obtain the best agreement that will allow Greece to stand on its feet and people to keep fighting. But there’s anger in Athens where some politicians say Greece has been blackmailed and humiliated. Also tonight: Disagreement among Labour’s leadership contenders on whether to support the Conservative cuts in tax credits. A deal within hours on Iran’s nuclear programme after marathon talks in Vienna. Doctors want a 20% tax on sugary drinks to help combat obesity. And first day in a newjob for Prince William as an air ambulance On BBC London: Environmental activists breach Heathrow security to protest against expansion - causing disruption to flights. And police warn of a rise in the number of people falling victim to phone scams. Good evening. Greece and its international creditors have finally reached agreement on measures to tackle the country’s debt crisis. Underthe plan, Greece will get a third bailout, but only if it signs up to stringent new reforms in the next few days. There’ll be a short-term loan, to keep the country solvent, and allow the banks to reopen. In return, parliament must agree the extensive reforms, demanded by European creditors. That would pave the way for a third bailout in five years, of 86 billion euros. The talks took place in Brussels, and our Europe editor, Katya Adler, is there. Brussels has been left w no doubt eurozone rows still ringing in their ears and a shopping list of things to do before the details of this bail offout can be agreed. The Greek Parliament has to pass what it sees as a harsh deal and other eurozone Parliaments have to decide whether to fund it. It is a long way from the crisis being over and it was tough enough to get this far. It was a long, long night. Billed as the last chance for a deal on Greece. EU hacks are used to last-minute late-night deals, not ones stretching through to breakfast time. Talks nearly collapsed all together. Eurozone leaders were on a knife-edge. Don’t be fooled by this smile. The Greek Prime Minister had very few friends here. Trust in his government is at an all-time low following months of backtracking and insults. After 15 hours of arguments, he and the hard-line German Chancellor reached an impasse. The two leaders threatened to walk out. Pulled back from the brink, a weary looking Chancellor Merkel assured doubters she is now on board with the Greece deal. The situation is tense, so it’s in everyone’s interests to make the next steps work. If the Greek Parliament does its bit, trust can be regained. But conditions imposed on Greeks are harsh. Their Prime Minister had promised an end to what he called creditor imposed humiliation. He knows he will struggle to sell this deal at home. The deal is difficult, he said, but we have avoided financial asphyxiation and the collapse of the financial system. We fought as hard as we could. So, what next? To rebuild trust, the Greek Parliament is expected to pass VAT, tax and pension reforms this week. Eurozone finance ministers are working out an interim agreement to keep Greek banks afloat and debt repayment honoured. Worth an estimated 80 billion euros, the new bailout will be spread over three years, starting late summer if all those involved can agree. There are a lot of ifs involved here. This was no glorious victory for Greece or its eurozone partners. Sure, they arrived weary-eyed this morning with their we-did-it ITIESSBQE. Don’t forget today’s deal is about sitting down at a later date to hammer out those details, and as for reducing Greece’s crippling debt, that has been put on the back burner again. So, today’s agreement does not solve the Greek crisis in the long term, and a serious rift between eurozone countries have been exposed, not just with Greece but between EU powers Germany and a more conciliatory France. The French president said a compromise on Greece was necessary for EU unity. Today was a long negotiation but above all an historic decision because if Greece had left the eurozone, what would have been said? That the eurozone was not able to assure its solidarity, the eurozone would have gone backwards when it needs to go forward. What leaders wanted more than anything here was to restore trust in the wider eurozone, and there a victory has been achieved, after months of speculation talk of Greece falling out of the single currency has gone for now. Alexis Tsipras, the Greek Prime Minister, returned to Athens to face the reaction, and the challenge of getting the Greek parliament to approve the deal. His own party is divided, as the spending cuts being demanded are even sharper than those rejected in the recent referendum. Our chief correspondent, Gavin Hewitt, has the latest in Athens tonight. Alexis Tsipras may have had a tough time in Brussels, but he is struggling to sell this deal here in Athens. Hisjunior coalition partner Athens. His junior coalition partner tonight Athens. Hisjunior coalition partner tonight described the deal as the equivalent of a coup and civil servants are due to strike on Wednesday. It is still likely that the Parliament behind me will approve these tough measures on Wednesday, but there are signs here of political instability ahead. An Athen’s neighbourhood that supported Alexis Tsipras in his stand against austerity. They worked to a deal that kept Greece in the euro, but here there was more bewilderment than celebration. TRANSLATION: The country cannot bear these reform measures. It will become even more poor. You can see for yourself. Watch around. It used to be better before. This man had supported the radical left party, Syriza, believing it would say no to further cuts. TRANSLATION: I believed in Syriza. I voted for them. I think Syriza betrayed its friends and ideas. It had 180-degrees turn. Elsewhere in the capital, the mood was very different. Greece had secured its future in Europe. We are happy because we think this will bring stability to the country. We want to be in the euro and now we are 100% sure we are with the Europeans and Ifeel much more secure at the moment. I am relieved. But the deal is controversial. The Government has to identify 50 billion euros of valuable publicly owned assets, like ports and then transfer them to a special fund to be privatised. It will be managed by Greece but supervised by outsiders. People’s lives here will change. Early retirement will end. The VAT will go up on many food items. Sunday trading will be allowed and trade unions weakened. Even some Cabinet ministers are struggling to accept this. There was a first agreement, and under political pressure, and the imminent threat of sudden death of the real economy due to the closure of banks. Did Greece surrender? No, we survived. The minister told me that the Europe of austerity had won. The Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, has arrived back in Athens. His next challenge is to get Parliament to agree to the new measures by Wednesday and so unlock negotiations towards a third bailout. Almost certainly the raft of new measures, the tax increases, the pension reforms will be approved by the Parliament. But the Prime Minister will have to rely on the support of other The head of the European Commission, jean-Claude juncker, described the deal as a ‘compromise’ in which there were ‘no winners and no losers’. But the impact on the European Union is now under scrutiny, along with the long-term sustainability of the single currency. Our economics editor Robert Peston is in Athens and he’s been considering how the Greek crisis has damaged the wider European Union. I’m at the Acropolis, palpable legacy of Athens at the height of its pomp and power, impossible to associate with humiliation and capitulation, but that is what the rest of the eurozone, and especially Germany, has forced on the Greek Government. Rania Antonopoulos concedes that the Government she belongs to has been castrated by the rest of the eurozone. Greek people will want to know why not just say no? Why not go on your own? What would have happened to Greece if you turned this down? It is very clear that the asphyxiation of the banking sector was at full speed. The banks had been closed, as you know. That was not a choice of the Government. And the next step would have been an exit from the eurozone because if you cannot have any control over your banking system and zero liquidity in an economy there is no alternative. This is literally the birthplace of democracy but some would say the Greek crisis show the incompatibility of democracy in the eurozone because the Greek people voted for a government that promised to end austerity. The recent referendum was in effect a vote against austerity. But what has been forced on the Greek people is the price of an economic and financial rescue, is more austerity. How damaging do you think this has been, this episode, for the reputation of the European Union and the eurozone? I think that there is plenty that needs to be travelled in order to regain confidence in the European dream that brought us all together and the European Union. I expect that there will be many public reactions and outcry over what has transpired in the last 15 days. Athens, difficult to credit from up here but it is a country which has been and remains on the verge of economic catastrophe. There is a wider question for Europe - what do the divisions between eurozone governments and between those pillars of Europe, France and Germany in particular, on how to rescue Greece - what do those divisions tell us about the inability of the eurozone’s leaders to deliver the prosperity that Europeans believe they deserve? The acting Labour leader, Harriet Harman, has been defending her support for the Conservative policy of restricting child tax credits to two children per family. But she told Labour MPs in a meeting tonight that any decision on policy would be up to the party’s next elected leader. Three of the four contenders for the leadership said they would oppose the proposals. Our deputy political editor james Landale is at Westminster. What do you make of this? Labour is struggling to come to terms with its defeat and it is grappling with a dilemma - defeat and it is grappling with a dilemma - how much should it changed to reflect the views of voters? How much should it stay the same to offer a distinctive opposition to austerity? At times it is a passionate, heated, almost existential debate, and it was hard tonight in the House of Commons where in the hot seat was the acting leader, Harriet Harman. They are the low paid workers and families facing cuts to the benefits, cuts they might have imagined Labour would oppose but the party is divided over the welfare reforms and it is a division that goes to the heart of the debate about what kind of opposition Labour should be and what kind of leader it should choose. It’s temporary leadership says the party should not oppose all government welfare changes but today at another hustings meeting, three of those competing to lead the party for good said they couldn’t endorse Conservative cuts. We should oppose the changes, that is how Labour makes itself relevant... I don’t think it’s the right thing to do to cut tax credit -- I think it’s the right thing to do to cut tax credit-- I do cut tax credit -- I do think it is the right thing to do. It is brutal, it is against the young, I would oppose these changes... Harriet Harman gave an announcement at the weekend that Labour would not oppose all of the cuts, above all to reduce the welfare cap and cut credits for future in the. I think it is right to say we have to provide a credible alternative. People said we don’t trust you on welfare reform, we will oppose things, we have to put something else in its place because if we carry on making the same arguments we have over the last five years we will get the same results. Ten o’clock and we are saying the Conservatives are the largest party... This row goes to the heart of the debate over how the party should respond to election defeat. Tonight Harriet Harman was given a rough ride by some Labour MPs, angry at her refusal to oppose cuts to child tax credit. One MP told me she bombed, but Harriet Harman told MPs there was no point campaigning against the public with blanket opposition to welfare cuts. She said Labour would still oppose cuts to sickness benefits and student grants, but... If we oppose everything we will succeed on nothing and we have also got to bear in mind that we didn’t get elected at the last election not because people love the Tories or love David Cameron but because they didn’t trust must trust on the economy. This shows Labour is still coming to terms with defeat, a party that some MPs fear is electing its next leader and not necessarily the next prime minister. MPs in the Scottish National Party have said they will vote with Labour against the Government’s attempt to relax the ban on fox hunting in England and Wales. The SNP normally doesn’t take part in votes that do not directly affect Scotland. The leader of the party’s Westminster Group, Angus Robertson, said he wanted to remind what he called an ""arrogant UK government"" how slender its majority was. A former Ukip MEP has been sentenced to five years in prison for fraudulently claiming expenses from the European Parliament. Ashley Mote, who is 79, over claimed by nearly half a million pounds. The judge at Southwark Crown Court said he was thoroughly dishonest and a hypocrite for defrauding an institution he himself had criticised for being corrupt. A child has been rushed to hospital after being struck by a car during a standoff between police lines and loyalist protestors in north Belfast. The child became trapped under the car which was surrounded by crowds. Police officers managed to lift the vehicle to free the youngster, thought to be a girl. The trouble began as members of the Orange Order returned from Battle of the Boyne commemorations. A long-awaited deal on Iran’s nuclear programme is likely to emerge in the early hours. There had been reports during the day in Vienna, where the talks are taking place, that a breakthrough was imminent, but there was still debate about the lifting of restrictions on Iran’s nuclear activity and the easing of sanctions. Our diplomatic correspondent james Robbins is in Vienna with the latest. What is your reading of the latest position there? It is a city which has thrived on secrecy and rumours from much of its chequered history and the rumour mill is behind me are grinding exceedingly fast tonight, as they are in the Iranian capital as well. There have been signals that the president might be about to go on television and announce a deal, that has been postponed. I think the talks will go on through the night. It is about the nuclear issue with Iran but also about setting the relations between Iran and the outside world, the key powers represented here, on a completely different footing so a breakthrough will be important but we haven’t quite got there yet. Thank you. Doctors have called for a 20 per cent tax on sugary drinks. The British Medical Association says a third of the UK population will be obese by 2030 unless something is done to change people’s diets. The BMA says a tax would help and the money raised should be used to subsidise fresh fruit and vegetables. Our health editor Hugh Pym has the story. Deliveries of sugary soft drinks to Britain’s shops keep on coming and the debate on the health impact is gaining momentum. Lunchtime today at Malmesbury School in Wiltshire. Drinks with added sugar are not offered to pupils but they can bring them in with packed lunches. This age group is one which doctors really want to get the message about the potential dangers of too much sugar. I guess they are quite unhealthy... I asked pupils what they thought of the debate and the idea of a tax on sugary drinks. I believe we have all made the wrong decision and we have excessively chosen to drink sugary drinks so steps do need to be taken. Taxing more money for the drinks is just a bit stupid because in my eyes I’m having to pay slightly more money for something that I’m already quite controlled about. They’ll pop into a shop and practically they will just pick up the first drink they see and it’s usually full of sugar. The World Health Organisation recommends a maximum of six teaspoons of sugar a day but just one drink can take you close to or over this limit. There are more than eight teaspoons of sugar in this can of Coca-Cola. This bottle of Ribena has more than 12 teaspoons. This flavoured water contains nearly four. Sugary drinks actually should be described as mini health time bombs. We know that consumption ofjust one sugary drink per day is associated of increasing the risk of type two diabetes, even in people who are not obese. But drinks manufacturers argue that the sugar tax is not the answer. Wherever it is being tried in the world, in Mexico and in Europe, it hasn’t worked. Consumer demand has returned to its original patterns. The real issue here is obesity and the best way to tackle obesity with balanced diets and physical exercise. Whether it is in drinks or snacks, sugar is becoming an increasingly big political issue. NHS chiefs say Government intervention may be required but the food and drink industry argues that’s not necessary, it can be relied on to cut sugar content and help consumers make the right choices. Later this week, an official advisory group publishes guidelines on sugar consumption. That will keep the debate bubbling along. Hugh Pym, BBC News. For 15 years, nations have been following a series of ambitious UN pledges to improve the lives of the world’s poorest people - the Millennium Development Goals - and most have been considered a success. Global leaders, UN agencies, financial experts and aid groups are meeting in Ethiopia this week to discuss a new set of principles to underpin future development, so called Sustainable Development Goals. Our Africa correspondent Andrew Harding has been to Korem in northern Ethiopia, an area at the centre of the 1984 famine, to see if aid really does make a difference. Addis Ababa, Ethiopia’s high altitude capital and the heart of what may now be the world’s fastest-growing economy. By some 10% a year now, a staggering change from the bad old days. Bob Geldof, he knows about drink and wine... Even the man behind Live Aid famine relief three decades ago is now investing in the local wine industry. Things have tremendously changed, fast, quick, sometimes even I cannot believe the things I see today is changing the next month so I am seeing the country is being built. The country is getting built. In 1984, perhaps a million people starved to death in the north of the country. Today, the droughts continue here but irrigation and proper planning are making a visible difference. This one-year-old is severely malnourished but he is a rare case now, and he’s getting measured and no doubt saved at this brand-new hospital, built with British money. What is most striking is the attitude of local doctors, foreign aid is appreciated but they don’t want it for much longer. We are trying to make it ourselves, I hope in five or ten years we will have our own health facilities. You won’t need outside help anymore? Yeah. So that’s the aim? That’s the aim, yeah, we should support ourselves. But if poverty is falling fast here, there are 25 million people in need. Outside help still has a role. This farmer has no land of his own, his family stalked by hunger, but Britain’s £300 million annual aid package for Ethiopia helps pay him a wage for working on building projects that benefit the whole community. It works here more than anything anywhere else I’ve seen. This is probably the most exciting programme I’ve worked on in my life. Because it gets results? It gets huge results. There are still parts of Africa where the business of foreign aid seems endless and almost hopeless, but not here. Ethiopia’s government is very authoritarian but it’s also hugely ambitious, determined to fight poverty and to wean itself off foreign aid. Food for thought for the rest of the continent and for those arguing about aid, development and how best to help. Prince William started work today as an air ambulance pilot in East Anglia. He said he was looking forward to using the skills he’d learned as a search-and-rescue helicopter pilot with the RAF. He’s also been speaking about the demands of combining his newjob with fatherhood and his royal duties, as Nicholas Witchell reports. just want to say very, very happy to be here. First day - nerves! It’s a job he’s chosen to do, and which is hugely important to him - working shifts as an air ambulance pilot, something William regards as both a duty and a necessity. For me, it’s also a really important point to be grounded, and Ifeel doing a job like this really helps with grounding the core of what I’m sort of trying to become. What is that? What are you trying to become? That’s a very good question! I thinkjust, you know, trying to be a good guy, trying to do what you can and trying to be, you know, a decent individual, thoughtful. All those sorts of things, qualities in people that you would want to be associated with. His air ambulance role will be William’s primary occupation. His royal duties will take second place. That seems to suit him. At some point there’s probably going to be a lot more pressure and responsibility from the other side of my life. At the moment I’m juggling the two of them and a young family, and I’m enjoying it and I like the challenge. But, yes, inevitably down the line, things will probably become a little bit more difficult for me to do that. And what of that young family? What impact has the arrival of Charlotte had? It’s been obviously fantastic and she’s been a little joy of heaven. But at the same time, it is more responsibility, looking after two little ones, especially when George is around - he’s a little monkey! But it’s fantastic having a lovely family and I’m so thrilled and Catherine has been doing an amazing job as a mother and I’m very proud of her. They now have a son and a daughter, so any plans for more children? We’ve onlyjust had the second one! You never know what’s going to happen in the future. William, juggling family life and a dual sense of duty as a prince and as a pilot. Nicholas Witchell, BBC News, Cambridge Airport. Golf, and the Open begins this Thursday at St Andrews. The former world number one and three times Open champion Tiger Woods is there already, hoping for a revival in his form and fitness. He told our sports editor Dan Roan in an exclusive interview that he still had the appetite to win the sport’s oldest major. For over a decade Tiger Woods was sport’s biggest star, golf’s serial winner with 14 majors to his name and a personal fortune of $1 billion, but then came a very public fall from grace and a dramatic decline. Remarkable as it may seem, Woods is preparing for this week’s Open at St Andrews ranked a lowly 241st in the world, but he told me his priorities have changed. How tough has it been at times? How do you deal with playing worse than you would have expected to play? It’s a little bit harder now because Ijust don’t have as much time to devote to the game of golf, to practising. My kids are the most important things in my life. When I was younger making swing changes I could practice 14 hours a day, it didn’t matter. I didn’t have any other responsibilities. I drop golf and everything Ido to be with them. When you see your world ranking not what it should be or could be, some would say how do you deal with that? It is putting into perspective what is really the most important thing. When I was younger, it was golf. 18 years ago, Woods began his era of dominance. He seemed invincible. But then came scandal in his private life and a very public confession. I was unfaithful, I had affairs, I cheated. Woods refuses to talk about that period of his life but there has been no Major since, instead constant battles with form and fitness and this year some of the worst performances of his career. COMMENTATOR: I’ve never seen a professional do that, ever. You’ve had to suffer a bit of late to get where you want. Is that how you put it? You have to, if you’re making changes you have got to take a couple of steps backward before you make a giant leap forward. It will take a tremendous amount of work and patience. You will get there? I will get there eventually. Could you win? Absolutely. You really believe that? Tiger Woods knows how to master St Andrews, winning the Open Championship here twice in the past. Those days seem an awfully long time now of course but such is his stature in the game, he remains the star attraction. How long do you think you will play for, going forward? As far as I can feel like I am competitive and I can win golf tournaments. Nine years after Woods last won the Open, golf is struggling to retain popularity, but a Tiger back in the hunt at St Andrews this week could be a turning point, both for the sport and its fallen talisman. Dan Roan, BBC News. That’s all from us. Here on BBC One, it’s time for the news where you are. Good evening from BBC London News. I’m Riz Lateef. Environmental protestors closed a runway at Heathrow this morning after breaking through a perimeter fence and chaining themselves up. 13 flights were cancelled and others diverted during the demonstration against the possible expansion of the airport. Delayed passengers have expressed concerns over security arrangements. Our Transport Correspondent Tom Edwards reports. No ifs, no buts... A chance to remind the Prime Minister of his promise when he once ruled out a third runway, at 3am protestors cut through Heathrow’s perimeter fence and then chained themselves together on the runway. It had to be shut for three hours. That meant delays and 13 flight cancellations, and disbelief from passengers. I don’t know exactly what it was about, but to be on the runway and stop the planes, that’s a big deal. I don’t think it’s very good at all. No. Very worrying, actually. That shouldn’t happen when we’re supposed to be very security-minded these days. This isjust the latest protest from the network of activists known as Plane Stupid. Previously, they have targeted Gatwick. They want an end to airport expansion. The Government’s Airport Commission recently recommended a third runway at Heathrow. Protestors made no secret there will be direct action. Let’s be clear, no-one could possibly condone this type of criminal, stupid behaviour. It’s totally wrong and I very much hope that the perpetrators are brought to justice as soon as possible.

188,BBC1 London,13-jul-2015,BBC London News,22:30,10 mins,True,"Good evening from BBC London News. I’m Riz Lateef. Environmental protestors closed a runway at Heathrow this morning after breaking through a perimeter fence and chaining themselves up. 13 flights were cancelled and others diverted during the demonstration against the possible expansion of the airport. Delayed passengers have expressed concerns over security arrangements. Our Transport Correspondent Tom Edwards reports. No ifs, no buts... A chance to remind the Prime Minister of his promise when he once ruled out a third runway, at 3am protestors cut through Heathrow’s perimeter fence and then chained themselves together on the runway. It had to be shut for three hours. That meant delays and 13 flight cancellations, and disbelief from passengers. I don’t know exactly what it was about, but to be on the runway and stop the planes, that’s a big deal. I don’t think it’s very good at all. No. Very worrying, actually. That shouldn’t happen when we’re supposed to be very security-minded these days. This isjust the latest protest from the network of activists known as Plane Stupid. Previously, they have targeted Gatwick. They want an end to airport expansion. The Government’s Airport Commission recently recommended a third runway at Heathrow. Protestors made no secret there will be direct action. Let’s be clear, no-one could possibly condone this type of criminal, stupid behaviour. It’s totally wrong and I very much hope that the perpetrators are brought to justice as soon as possible. They caused serious disruption for large numbers of travellers, holiday-makers - it’s totally unfair. Local residents recently blocked the entrance to Heathrow and today’s protest will again raise questions about security at the airport. The campaigners say their action was justified. I don’t think they are irresponsible at all. Why not?

A South London council has tonight approved plans to demolish a housing estate despite protests by residents outside the town hall. Lambeth wants to knock down more than 300 homes on the Cressingham Gardens Estate in Tulse Hilland rebuild, with even more social housing. But people living there claim they’re being forced out. Police in the capital are warning about a rise in the number of elderly and vulnerable people being targeted in cold-calling scams. BBC London has learned they’re now dealing with more than 150 cases a month. It comes amid concerns that the tactic may be being used by some extremists to raise money. Our home affairs correspondent Nick Beake has the story. As a respected chemist, Dr Robert Sykes travelled to more than 100 countries, but it was a highly plausible scam which targeted him at home which cost him thousands of pounds. They asked me if I would go to the bank and get some money, but not to tell the bank why because they thought bank staff were also involved. It was convincing? Ifeel an utter, complete idiot. I fell for it. This morning, police were explaining to residents in the City of London that phone scams are on the rise. In London last year, 1,940 incidents were reported to the action fraud centre. That means five Londoners were targeted every day, and this sort of crime tripled across the UK in 2014, with victims losing £29 million. Phone scams are nothing new, but now it is being claimed that in some cases extremist groups are using the technique to raise money so that they can get to Syria. Counter-terrorism officers say they’ve uncovered a large-scale fraud and later this month, 12 men from in and around London will appear in court. Increasingly, scammers claim they are ringing from the police or a bank, saying a debit or credit card needs to be replaced. Victims are asked to ring the number on the back of their card, but the fraudster hasn’t hung up and keeps the line open. Victims are then tricked into revealing their pin. Finally a bogus courier comes and takes the card, leaving the fraudsters free to withdraw the cash. Police believe the rise is because banks have tightened up their own security, so the criminals are targeting the victims directly. I can make it crystal clear, the banks and the police will never, ever call you and ask for your personal information or get you to reveal personal passwords or pin numbers over the phone. Robert eventually got his money back, but fears many others could fall prey to the same scam. Time for me to say goodnight and leave you with Sara Thornton for a look at the weather. Brightening up, we hope? Eventually, but an uncomfortable night tonight and a muggy day tomorrow. Lots of cloud around again and damp weather at times. That is how we stay through the night tonight, temperatures not falling away too far with all of the cloud around. 15-17 C as we start Tuesday morning. A lot of cloud, feeling """"UQQY morning. A lot of cloud, feeling muggy and damp at times. There will be dry weather but you cannot discount anywhere the idea that you could have drizzle. Top temperature of 22 Celsius, where we should be for the time of year. Continuing on a similarvein into for the time of year. Continuing on a similar vein into Wednesday, the weather fronts are clearing away, so some signs of improvement as we go through Wednesday. Another dank start, cloud around and some mist, but gradually we will have brighter skies filtering through. Dry and sunny weather in the afternoon, 25 degrees. Southeasterly wind on Thursday boosting temperatures. So in the outlook we will see more sunshine as we move towards the weekend, and warming up as well. Now the National forecast with Matt Taylor. Good evening. Changeable Taylor. Good evening. Changeable is a good word to use or the weather for the rest of the week and the reason for that lies in the skies above the UK. This is where we can find the jet stream at the moment, not especially strong but it is effectively a motorway for low pressure systems and will keep bringing them through. Moving northwards and southwards, keeping the weather systems changeable over the next few days. Cool edge to the north and warm air to the south of the jet stream. Clear and cooler conditions across the North tonight remaining rather cloudy, damp and drizzly across many parts of England and Wales. Hillfort in the south-west and another muggy night, dropping much below the mid-teens. -- hill fog. Further north away from towns and cities, temperatures in single figures in the morning. The brightest of the weather here, loud and rein in Northern Ireland late in the morning and the best sunshine in northern England will be early and late in the day, as the cloud and outbreaks of rain get close in the afternoon. South of that, a lot of cloud, just the odd break further east. Rain and drizzle, especially during the afternoon, assistant in the south-west with a lot of hill fog. Still mild and humid.-- south-west with a lot of hill fog. Still mild and humid. -- persisted in the south-west. Some afternoon showers for the Pennines and eastern Scotland. They use away, remaining misty overnight into Wednesday and fairly muggy towards the south initially. It will take a while to brighten up. Elsewhere, starting with sunshine, sunny spells for everybodyjust with sunshine, sunny spells for everybody just about everybodyjust about by the end of the day. One or two showers possible in the East later on. Most will have a dry and sunny afternoon on Wednesday, pleasant in the sunshine and warmest in the south-east. Warm air now, the jet stream has buckled northwards by Thursday. So the warmer segment ofair. northwards by Thursday. So the warmer segment of air. And in the dip of thejet warmer segment of air. And in the dip of the jet stream as well, low pressure developing. The impact on Thursday will be indirect, just some cloud spreading ahead of it. Hazy sunshine and a dry day, rather than blue skies. As it approaches, we bring in southeasterly wind, bringing in some of the heat, near continent. Not everywhere, the warmest conditions will be in the south, 25-28 degrees in the north-west of London and, further north with wind and rain by the end of the night. Some overnight thunderstorms in the south-east. They will ease off. Sunshine and showers on Friday, the Toni Morrison... She’s America’s first lady of literature.

189,BBC1 London,18-jul-2015,BBC News,01:15,285 mins,True,"A few showers passing through in the breeze, but a wet and windy start for some across Scotland, central and Southern areas in particular. Winds touching gale force through the morning and into the afternoon around some of these Eastern areas. The Open golfers won’t be pleased. Plenty of rain in the Northwest highlands, but Southern Scotland will see some sunshine and Northern Ireland, a better day than we saw on Friday, with some sunny conditions and just one or two showers. The odd shower for the Northern England, the Midlands and Wales, pushing through quite smartly on the breeze, sunshine following on behind. The further south you are, likely to stay dry. Temperatures around 20-24 degrees without the humidity of recent days. Saturday night into Sunday, most start dry, but then the Atlantic starts to roar its way back in, with plenty of cloud, outbreaks of rain and temperatures holding up as humidity levels start to creep up once again, most notably across the South of the UK. It does lead into quite a wet start to Sunday in many areas. A really messy weather chart to go with it. One set of weather fronts pushing through. Areas of low pressure to the Southwest bringing more in the way of wet weather later in the day. Northern Ireland seeing the best of the weather on Sunday - mostly dry and bright, one or two showers. Scotland, Northern England, North Wales and North Midlands, morning rain giving way to something a bit drier and brighter. A few glimpses of sunshine through the afternoon. I think we’ll hold on to more cloud in East Anglia, Southern England, South Wales and here rain on and off during the day. Temperatures still getting to around 22 degrees, humid across the Channel Islands, fresher further North, but at least you’ll have some afternoon sunshine. Rain gets a little bit heavier and persistent as we go through Sunday night and then eases off into Monday morning. This weather front is dividing light from something cooler across the Northern half of the UK and something a little more humid towards the South. It will be working its way Northwards through the day, bringing some occasional mainly light and patchy rain, but any cloud breaks in the South could lift temperatures above what you see in the chart. That low pressure system continuing to work its way North through Monday night into Tuesday could produce some heavier bursts of rain, Scotland and Northern Ireland especially. We’ve seen plenty of rain of late. It will gradually ease away through Tuesday. On the Southern flank of that low pressure system, you’ve got the Southwest winds bringing some clouds to Western areas, some showers, a lot of dry and brighter weather, especially further South and East, and the best of the temperatures could be even higher than 20 degrees Celsius on the chart. Same again into Wednesday. Low pressure to the North, a generally South-westerly airflow. Not a particularly strong one, so get the sunshine. It will feel quite warm, but areas of cloud drifting through on that and we’ll see some outbreaks of rain. Northern Ireland, Southern Scotland and Northern England best favoured. We’ve got to remember we’ve still got some very hot air across continental Europe - any Southerly flow of wind will bring that towards us, but we’ve still got sea temperatures in the North Atlantic lower than they should be and it does look like, as high pressure builds in from the Southwest next week, we will bring in the North-westerly winds, so temperatures, most notably at night, will be on the rather cool side. A lot of dry and fine weather, just one or two showers at that high pressure system pushing its way through. But as it does work its way Eastwards, we start to bring in South-westerly winds once again, boosting temperatures, but opening the door to Atlantic weather, so increased amount of clouds, a few showers and then this weather system is set to bring some longer spells of rain. The summer switch is continuing to be tinkered with. All bets are off, as BBC One opens the traps on the booming world of bookies. You know the upside to you losing? What? We win. The stakes are high and the adrenaline higher. Ijust managed to lose 35,000 in a fortnight. I’ll either be ripping me ticket up or picking me money up, one of the two. years, was there something more sinister going on? I think the challenge that the FBI has here is that when they look at this made a see somebody who went to high school in that part of Tennessee who was part of the wrestling club, who got a degree in electrical engineering, and the all outward intents and purposes there was nothing that would mark him as a possible terror suspect. And so in that sense what we know publicly as the trail appears to go cold, and I think investigators are up against that dreaded scenario that they have this atrocity on their hands, but there appear to have been, at least, as far as we go outwardly, no warning signs that this was going to take place. And anyone speculating as to a potential motive here? Well, they are not. And certainly the FBI and other investigators have been clear over the last 1+8 hours that they still do not know what the motive may have been. Now, it was only a week, and we were saying this yesterday, since the director of the FBI was talking about the threat from so-called lone wolf attacks, people inspired over the Internet by jihadist groups such as Islamic State group. But we still don’t know whether or not this man was acting completely alone, whether or not they may have been others involved in the sense that he was having online chat with others or whether he may have been reading material online and was inspired, if you like, why that. That is the key line of enquiry now for the FBI as they continue, as we said, to treat this as a terrorist investigation until they get any information to suggest it was not. -- by that. Memorials have been held around the world for the victims of Flight MH17, which was shot down over eastern Ukraine a year ago. All 298 people on board were killed. A Dutch-led investigation team has been working to try to determine who was responsible. Russian-backed rebels have been widely blamed for the attack, something Moscow denies. Tom Burridge has more. In their village church, the people that witnessed the horror of the aftermath paid their respects to the innocent men, women and children on board, who were strangers to this community, which, a year on, is still trying to reconcile what happened. This video gives a sense of the carnage and chaos, just after the passenger plane was brought down. The pro-Russian rebel soldiers who filmed it are confused about what has happened. On that day, this woman heard the explosion, and saw parts of the plane drop out of the sky. But when she rushed home, she discovered that a woman’s body had fallen through her roof. Today, they honoured the dead. But finding out who was responsible for killing 298 innocent people in a war zone is a hugely complicated task. Away from the genuine sense of grief here, there is a poisonous climate of mistruth and propaganda in this region, linked to the ongoing conflict. So, even when the Dutch-led international investigation team decides what and who brought the plane down, the next hurdle is finding justice for those who died. 20-year-old Ben Pocock from near Bristol was on board the plane. His fatherjeremy says the British Government must continue to fight forjustice for all of the victims who died. We mustn’t lose sight of the fact that there were 80 children on that plane, including many babies. Whole families were wiped out, and there were numerous young adults, including Ben, who had reallyjust started their adult lives. And in the blink of an eye, he was gone. Today, the pro-Russian rebels in charge of this area made sure that lots of their flags were flying at an event of remembrance by the main crash site. This was an international tragedy. But Russia and the West back different sides in this region’s war, and they are unlikely to agree on who killed those on-board flight MH17, and how to implementjustice. South African paramedics say at least 250 people have been injured after two trains collided injohannesburg during the evening rush hour. None of the injured are believed to be in a critical condition. One of the trains is reported to have been stationary when the collision happened. The cause of the crash isn’t yet known. More new stunning images of Pluto have been unveiled by the US Space Agency. They were captured by the New Horizons probe, which earlier this week made history by flying past this distant world. Our science correspondent Rebecca Morelle has been following the developments. Around the world, Muslims are celebrating Eid al-Fitr, the festival that marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan. After weeks of fasting between dawn and dusk, it is a chance to celebrate. The BBC’s Tim Allman has more. A sea of devotion. Hundreds of thousands of people performing the Eid per hourat thousands of people performing the Eid per hour at the grand Mosque in Mecca. Among them the Saudi king. An extraordinary spectacle on a truly epic scale. It is all a little bit more low-key in epic scale. It is all a little bit more low- key in Gaza are epic scale. It is all a little bit more low-key in Gaza are amongst the rubble buildings that children are making the best of things. TRANSLATION: There are many districts where we live that are completely destroyed, so I want to shout out to the whole world that Palestinian children want to celebrate the festival of Eid in peace. In northern Iraq, thousands of people have fled their homes because of the battle against the so-called Islamic State but even here there are suites, and presents, and smiles. -- here there are suites, and presents, and smiles. -- sweets. Outside this Mosque in Manhattan, more prayers, more devotion. But in what are tense times for many Muslims in the United States, there is a message as well. So American people need to know the difference between terrorism and good Muslims. We are good Muslims. We will fight for America, we are here for America because America has been good to us, and when we say God bless America, we mean it. The festival will continue over the weekend. Muslims around the world taking a moment to reflect, and to celebrate. Coming up next, it’s Click. First the weather with Nick Miller. Hello, and welcome to the weekend. Some rain, some wind, but most of us will get at least one fine day out of it. Here is the big picture then for Saturday morning. Low pressure to the north of Scotland, after a windy night. Still strong, gusty winds here to start the day. Still some wet weather around. Fine start elsewhere, weather fronts though waiting to come in to change things for part two of the weekend, on Sunday, as I will show you in a moment. This is how it looks, though, for the first part of Saturday morning. The wind arrows in Scotland, still very gusty winds here. Lighter winds elsewhere, and as you can see, plenty of sunshine across southern England to begin the day. Should be plenty of bright, blue sky. A fresh start, temperatures gradually heading up. It will feel warm in that sunshine by the afternoon. A bit of patchy cloud around for Wales, northern England, Northern Ireland. Quite windy, especially to the north. But the strongest, most gusty winds will be across Scotland. So really low to the east. Clouds and outbreaks of rain still most persistent out towards the west. As that low pressure for northern Scotland begins to pull away, it takes its rain with it gradually through the day. Still some wet weather though in parts of the Highlands for the afternoon. Only slowly the wind easing, but it is still windy into the afternoon. Breezy elsewhere, a few showers pop up in parts of Northern Ireland, northern Wales, and north England. A cloudy spell of weather to come for most of you. Plenty of sunshine though across southern parts of Wales and England. This will see the warmest weather. Now, what does all of that mean for the golf at St Andrews? Could be some rain around first thing. It looks dryer as the day goes on, it gets brighter too, but it is windy. Very gusty winds, that is the main challenge for the golfers. It will be late in the day before things start to improve. Those hoping for rain for the cricket won’t get any for Saturday. On Sunday, though, if there is still some play to be had, it is a different story, because as we go through Saturday night and into Sunday, those weather fronts start to come in. This is the picture on Saturday evening. Eventually we will see more persistent, heavy rain coming into Northern Ireland. And as we go on through the rest of the night, then more of us are going to see increasing cloud, and eventually these weather fronts move through, we get some outbreaks of rain. But do not write Sunday off at this stage. Whilst there is still a lot of uncertainty about the detail, it looks as if early rain just starts to pull away. And actually, for many of us, things begin to improve. That is particularly the case on Sunday, we think, across the northern half of the UK. You start to see some sunny spells, still a few showers in Scotland. We keep a lot of cloud though in the south, and we could well see some further outbreaks of rain coming back in from the south-west later in the day. But, got plans on Sunday? Keep checking the weather. The latest headlines from BBC News. I’m Peter Dobbie. US security services have described the shooting of four marines in Tennesee ""an act of terrorism"". Memorial services are being held for the victims who were shot down at two military facilities in Chattanooga. British pilots have carried out airstrikes against the so-called Islamic State in Syria, despite the UK voting against it two years ago. The government says 20 personnel were involved in the mission. Four people are feared dead and another four are in hospital after several large explosions at a wood mill in Cheshire. The blasts near Macclesfield were so strong they shook nearby houses. Rescue teams are waiting to enter the collapsed building to search for three men and one woman. Now on BBC News, Click. This week... Who are we, who are we? Not quite sure. We’re all wearing masks. But there will be crouching, rolling and is that dancing?! Sometimes, I think the latest technology can be a little too engrossing. Yeah, I could totally rob this place right now. They wouldn’t even know. Ha! This is NextVR in Laguna Beach, California. It is an outfit that specialises in streaming sports events in virtual reality to users of VR headsets around the world. When I dropped in, the US Open Golf Championships were the order of the day. I am standing on a grassy bank overlooking the US Open. I can see some spectators here. A guy with a sign, waving it around, that feels like it will clout me in the face! I am really up close and personal with the players, who are all having a bit of a swing. That must be the Goodyear blimp. Always good to see the Goodyear blimp. He’s taking his time. That’s the thing about golf, it’s a slow sport and you don’t know if the feed’s frozen or if that is what it looks like in real life! NextVR also deals in faster sports, giving fans the chance to experience something normally restricted to those blessed with great contacts or massive wallets - front row seats. The feeling of being next to the action with the freedom to look in any direction they want. This is the kind of set-up required to cover all the angles. A constellation of extremely wide-angle stereoscopic camera each shooting at an impressive 6K resolution. But capturing and delivering a decent 3D VR experience live is hard. The wraparound image can be 21+,000 pixels across and those watching it might be using mobile phone-based headsets over mobile networks running at fairly low slow speeds. -- running at fairly slow speeds. The challenge is to build an accurate representation of the world and do it quickly - fast enough so if a basketball player runs across acourt, we have an accurate map of that happening. For faster and more accurate 3D depth perception, the camera constellations also include two special light-filled cameras, which concentrate solely on depth information, resulting in images like this. Another trick to reducing the amount of data to be streamed is to send only a low resolution version of most of the view and a high resolution version ofjust the portion you are currently focusing on. And finally, for sports where all the action happens in front of you, NextVT will use only one pair of 3D cameras, reducing the field of vision to 180 degrees, but halving the size of the image. This is an underwater digital 3D system that captures in high enough resolution for an IMAX-size screen. One of the co-founders of the company is film-maker Dj Roller, who has produced and directed in some of the most extreme environments in the world. We talked about VR moving to other types of entertainment and in particular another problem with giving the audience a complete 360-degree view. Namely, where do you hide the production team? The very first time we tried to put something in a dramatic situation in a set, we thought what is it going to be like? There is a crew behind you. The lights overhead. Most of the sets are built in Cad, in computers now, so to film the ceiling, the floors and the walls, you turn around in that dramatic piece and there is a wall behind you, not the camera crew. So the crew can be removed, but how will the performers fare? This kind of experience might usher in a particular type of actor. It is going to be interesting. It is like when you went from silent movies to talking movies, there were actors who were probably better performers in a silent film. The same thing for VR. The acting is a whole other level. How you perform in VR might be a whole new set of actors that sell in VR. Giving yourself a spectator’s view of a sport or music event is a compelling and pretty obvious use of VR. And there are plenty of companies which are looking at different uses for VR, including the one that put it back on the map a few years ago with this, Oculus. We have been to see them in San Francisco. This is not my typical movie-going behaviour. Oh! Then again, I’m not watching a typical movie. I can see the moon. Canopy of trees. I am in the midst of a thicket of towering trees, experiencing Lost, the first VR film from Oculus Story Studio. Story Studio is a collection of artists and technicians who are trying to tell stories in virtual reality. Lost tells the story of an oversized mechanical hand that’s searching for its robot body. In a VR film like Lost, a viewer decides where they want to look, so the filmmaker has to create and animate every inch of the environment, whether it is the full moon or the forest floor. Because we are in a real-time game engine, we are rendering on the fly and so where you look determines where we are rendering. A Pixarfilm is 21+ frames per second. It’s about 90 minutes long. And each frame for the final render takes about 50 hours for a computer to make And I have II miliseconds. Still, the end result is so mesmerising, users could get, well, lost in the film. That story studio uses tricks to keep pacey. -- But Story Studio uses tricks to keep pacey. Once you look at the credits, we have a bird flutter right past you. What is wonderful is people say, did I do that? Did Ifrighten the bird? And we have audio that will draw you to the correct location to look. The studio’s second film, Henry, debuts this summer. Henry is this little spiky haired child who wants to get a hug. He just needs to find a friend. He is too spiky for everyone. If the shorts remind you of Pixar films, there is good reason. The studio hired several from Pixar. The others are from DreamWorks and gaming companies. The work is similar to a degree, but VR has added constraints. Everything is happening around you. No matter where you look, the character’s still alive somewhere in the space. VR has caught Hollywood’s attention. Spike jones created a VR news film. Along with enthusiasm, though, there is scepticism. Lost was criticised for not exploring VR’s full potential. We don’t have the technology yet and it felt better to restrain ourselves a little bit. But I think with each new experience we make, we will try something new, we will try to add a different level of interactivity. A different narrative device, a different trick to get the audiences attention and that’s what’s exciting about this. It feels like it is research as well as making it. Every new medium has its challenges. Oculus acknowledges motion sickness can occur and the longer you spend in VR the more likely you are to feel it. That could limit the length of films. With each film, though, VR inches towards the ultimate goal- a live action, hollow deck-like experience that takes you to another world. An animated character looking at me, that is one thing. A human being looking right into my eyes, interacting with me, that is not there with me, that is a man on the moon moment. That is the first telephone call. So, the Oculus Rift lets you see and hear the virtual world around you and the touch controllers let you use your hands to interact with it. But maybe a better way of putting yourself into the world is to put your whole self into the world. And for that, you need a suit, sir. And for that, we need Mark. just outside Los Angeles we find control VR, the company partnered with a motion capture outfit called Radius. They have adapted software for use in virtual reality. This motion capture suit is fitted with motion tracking and detection devices. I am going to suit up and try it out. What censors have we got at work? Inertial measurement units. Three gyroscopes, magnetometers and three accelerometers. They will track any movements I make. They can be used to animate computer-generated characters, avatars. There is additional centres in all of the fingers? Yes. It is wired up, it goes to the brain... And wirelessly send a signal. I will get to see afterwards what my avatar looks like. We are told I am going to be very pleased. On screen is my avatar, which is a remarkable likeness. Combining off-the-shelf components, the team have reduced the cost of suits like this, and they have found new applications for the technology. We have taken previously unavailable technology to consumers, taking the price point from over $50,000 to a place where for a future and dollars is essentially the technology allowing the physical body to be put into a virtual world. A quick change out of this suit and into a prototype VR rig. This is the abolition of full motion capture suit I was wearing earlier, it is a harness with senses over my body in the places where they were in the other suit. I am connected to Oculus Rift. This is really weird being able to see my hand in front of me. I can move my fingers. They react properly. Ah, some cubes here. We are normally used to controlling games and using computers or consoles with some kind of control orjoy pad. This is the most natural thing, turning the body into a controller. Weirdly, it takes a little bit of getting used to. I willjust drop that. The next stage for this technology is to include force feedback in the Oculus -- for this technology is to include force feedback in the Oculus -- in the macro -- force feedback in the Oculus -- in the macro -- rig I am wearing. The idea is to have as lifelike a process in a virtual world where if I am reaching out and putting a dog I can feel the dog’s hair. That technology will happen in the next decade and I think meaningful applications, we will see in the next year. Developers are working on new applications for this kit and the control VR rig should launch in 2016. Away from the VR world and it has been an eventful week, especially if you happen to be a ready user. The chief executive plans to take action against parts of the site deemed offensive and obscene -- of the site deemed offensive and obscene -- Reddit. And it is fairto say that his comments were not universally welcomed by the Reddit community. It was the week where Spare 150 grand would have bought you a coding machine. Apple Pay tried to remove the plastic from your pocket and Solar Impulse plane was grounded. There was better news for a journey that has taken nine years. Nasser’s Road has taken what we have been waiting for, these amazing close-ups of Pluto -- we have been waiting for, these amazing close-ups of Pluto -- NASA. The probe is powered by the same computer chips that were used in the original Sony PlayStation 20 years ago. Other computing power was apparently not available. Increasing signs we are going to lose our jobs, japan’s first robot hotel will open this week. The hotel in Nagasaki has a creepy looking receptionist and an English-speaking robotic concierge dinosaur. Yes, dinosaur. It is nojurassic World. That is probably a good thing. Dinosaurs and up eating everyone. -- end. Last week I looked at VPNs and talked about why it is important to use one especially on a public hotspot like this cafe. As usual when I started my research I did a shout out on Twitter to find out whether there were any apps I could try, and the couple said why don’t you make your own VPNs using Raspberry Pi be kept high. Far be it for me to shy away from a tech challenged as Mac Raspberry Pie. This will allow you to log onto your network using any device from anywhere in the world, accessing your shared documents and surfing the web as if you were at home. Firstly, if anybody tells you this is going to be quick and simple, they are most likely delusional. That said, it is entirely possible, with a bit of time and a lot of concentration. Even if you’ve got no experience in using Raspberry Pie or doing any coding yourself. That is the case, set aside an entire day, make sure you have plenty of copy to hand, and get ready for some fun and games. -- hand, and get ready for some fun and games. -- coffee. There is literally no point in my trying to step you through it in the three minutes we have here today, so what I have done is create a text document on our website. And you can follow that, step by very careful step, and you can set up your very own personal home VPN. It doesn’t cost you any money and it is secure because you are going in the end and not through any company, it isjust are going in the end and not through any company, it is just through you. What I have done is I thought I would give you a couple of pointers of some of the things that will save you a lot of time and that tripped me up during this process of discovery. Once set up, the first thing you need to do is change the default password because connecting to the Internet with a default password that anyone can know is just plain stupid. If you don’t want to mess around plugging in keyboards and switching your monitor is over, then you can actually operate your Raspberry Pi through an existing computer set up. And to do this you just need to download and use a piece of free utility software called Putty. You are now ready to step very carefully through the stages that I have listed in my step by step guide. The one most important thing you need to do here is concentrate. Every step of the way there is a lot of text that you’ve got to enter and if you get one tiny little typo in their, then the whole thing will fall down and you will have to retrace your footsteps to train debug your programme. You need to issue a password Key for all of the devices that you want to be able to connect to externally. You are now finally ready to download and install the Open VPN connect app on your android or your IPhone device. And once that is connected, what you do is navigate to where you have stored the password Key on your device, and just use the software to install it. And you can now use your VPN tunnel to browse more securely through your home connection, and access files and folders that you’ve left on your shared drive at home. You can also give yourself a massive pat on the back, because you just levelled up the Geek Level ten. Congratulations. There are loads of great VR demos out there, designed to convince us to buy into the technology. The Whale demo from last week really was something. But surely it is going to be gaining that drives virtual reality and with that there is not that much doing at the moment, to be honest. Atjust after that much doing at the moment, to be honest. At just after I honest. Atjust after I did this at Bossa studios they held again jam to work out some new VR ideas. Take a load of developers, fill them with pizza and outcomes game. At least thatis pizza and outcomes game. At least that is the theory. It sounds crazy but their last two games were invented like this. Stephen Beckett went to taste the jam and a pizza. Ugh! These guys and girls are about to become world experts in VR games. That is because they will soon be some of the only people that have actually made one. Down in the basement of London’s Somerset House, ten teams have only 36 hours to figure out how you make a game on one of these. Come next year there’ll be a whole host of headsets this in shops. But what will you be playing on them. If anyone knows, it is this lot. So our idea is... Our idea is essentially a conveyor belt. Hours save your idiot babies. Our idea is you have these little penguins and you are going to have to try and feed the penguins. VR is all, you have to start with a fresh mind, throw away everything you think you know, and approach it with a very... Childish approach, in which you just let go and you experiment. Right now we are in one of the testing rooms. This is where people can come and check their creations in VR. As you can see there is a lot of space, which is all the better because you can do things like crawling around the floor. As the jam draws to a close, 36 hours of coding has understandably taken its toll but the new VR games have been born. Let’s don the headset and tried out. OK, Iam in a room with Let’s don the headset and tried out. OK, I am in a room with a out. OK, Iam in a room with a bear. Give the soap to bare. Whereas the soap? Lovely. Iam on Give the soap to bare. Whereas the soap? Lovely. I am on top of a car, Iam soap? Lovely. I am on top of a car, I am going to leap to this car. I have six seconds. And pancakes on the floor. It really feels like I am a little tunnel. I am surrounded by penguins! Washing bears aside though, from playing lots of these games, they are all trying to solve the same problems. What is interesting about all of these games as they have all found different ways the kind of hang you into a five x five foot space. The Penguin one had a more natural thing, five x five foot space. The Penguin one had a more naturalthing, I don’t want tojump one had a more naturalthing, I don’t want to jump on the sea. And one had a more naturalthing, I don’t want tojump on the sea. And I certainly don’t want to jump over the spiky fence either. For me though this was the most interesting game of the bunch. This is a game called Heist. What I like about this game is it uses the whole space of the room. It is fairly simple in terms of gameplay logic, but what really works is because you are crawling around on the physical floor, it feels like you are actually crawling through a vent. These are the first steps towards making VR games as rich and varied as our games are now. But what will be VR’s killer app? Well, whatever it is, finding out is certainly going to be amusing for the people watching. So we have been talking a lot about VR, in case you haven’t noticed. And that is because there is a lot about VR to say. Now you may have seen headsets like these being used in a videogame to simulate driving a car around the track. I think it is safe to say that the one thing you would never want to do is wear one of these while you are driving a real car around a real track. Because that would be insane. Imagine being able to drive around but not see the parking lot you’re in, see distorted visuals orjumping up. A sickly playing a videogame with a car that you are. We drove a car with a virtual reality mask, with the Occulus headset, in a course they designed, basically a dynamic or so there were obstacles flying at me, sort of like again, if you will, where I am trying to reach the end of the game. Things are jumping up at UN coming up out of the ground, we had handsjumping out, that way that you see, so while he was driving through he had all of these obstacles popping up and randomly coming out him and he had to basically dynamically move through them to make sure he didn’t crash in the game. Because if you crash and again, as much as you are physically crashing in the real world, your brain sees it as a crash, so you slam on the brakes. In the game I would be driving of course but in the real world I was doing OK, so that was pretty crazy. And physically felt kind of nauseating. We started with a 2015 Mustang, pulled all of the data out of the car that we could, stuff like the throttle, the brake pressure and the steering angle, and the car is the game controller. We do have a GPS and we do have IMUs, accelerometers like in your phone that’s on which direction they appointed but the steering and braking are just like they would be if you had a regular game controller in your hand, the a and B buttons and steering. The gas pedals, the controller, the brake pedals is the controller, and they can inject into the virtual world what the car is doing so it is really crazy, for sure. And yes, please do go ahead and try that at home. Anyway, you can follow us on Twitter and catch up with the latest tech news throughout the week on our website. That is it from Laguna Beach in California, I’m afraid. I have to go and catch a plane back to London right now. Well... In a bit. Hello, and welcome to the weekend. Some rain, some wind, but most of us will get at least one fine day out of it. Here is the big picture then for Saturday morning. Low pressure to the north of Scotland, after a windy night. Still strong, gusty winds here to start the day. Still some wet weather around. Fine start elsewhere, weather fronts though waiting to come in to change things for part two of the weekend, on Sunday, as I will show you in a moment. This is how it looks, though, for the first part of Saturday morning. Notice the wind arrows in Scotland, still very gusty winds here. Lighter winds elsewhere, and as you can see, plenty of sunshine across southern England to begin the day. Should be plenty of bright, blue sky. A fresh start, temperatures gradually heading up. And it will feel warm in that sunshine by the afternoon. A bit of patchy cloud around for Wales, northern England, Northern Ireland. Quite windy, especially to the north. But the strongest, most gusty winds will be across Scotland. So a really blowy start. Clouds and outbreaks of rain still most persistent out towards the west. Now as that low pressure for northern Scotland begins to pull away, it takes its rain with it gradually through the day. Only slowly the wind easing, but it is still windy into the afternoon. Breezy elsewhere, a few showers pop up in parts of Northern Ireland, maybe north Wales, and north England. A cloudy spell of weather to come for most of you. Plenty of sunshine though across southern parts of Wales and England. This will see the warmest weather. Now, what does all of that mean for the golf at St Andrews? Could be some rain around first thing. It looks dryer as the day goes on, gets brighter too, but it is windy. Very gusty winds, that is the main challenge for the golfers. It will be late in the day before things start to improve. Those hoping for rain for the cricket won’t get any for Saturday. On Sunday, though, if there is still some play to be had, it is a different story, because as we go through Saturday night and into Sunday, those weather fronts start to come in. This is a picture on Saturday evening. Eventually, as you can see, we will see more persistent, heavy rain coming into Northern Ireland. And as we go on through the rest of the night, then more of us are going to see increasing cloud, and eventually these weather fronts move through, we get some outbreaks of rain. But do not write Sunday off at this stage. Whilst there is still a lot of uncertainty about the detail, it looks as if early rain does start to pull away, and actually, for many of us, things begin to improve. That is particularly the case on Sunday, we think, across the northern half of the UK. You start to see some sunny spells, still a few showers in Scotland. We keep a lot of cloud though to the south, and we could well see some further outbreaks of rain coming back in from the south-west later in the day. But, got plans on Sunday? Keep checking the forecast. Welcome to BBC News, broadcasting to viewers on public television in the US and around the globe. My name’s Ben Bland. Our top stories: Wildfires are sweeping across a California mountain pass, setting cars alight and forcing drivers to flee the flames. The FBI says a shooter who attacked Marines in Tennessee was carrying two guns. Ceremonies have been held in Ukraine and across the world to remember the victims of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, a year after it was shot down. And NASA releases more incredible images of the dwarf planet Pluto, revealing mountain ranges and crater-less plains. Hello. A fast-moving wildfire has swept across a highway in California engulfing cars and threatening several mountain communities. A number of cars are in flames on Interstate 15. It links southern California and Las Vegas. Hundreds of firefights are at the scene. So far more than 500 acres have been affected. You can see the thick, black smoke covering the area. Some people are taking to social media, talking about concerns that they may have to evacuate their homes. This is a major road. Very busy. Temperatures are high in the area. The mid- 30s Celsius, high 90s in Fahrenheit. These images have been taken from a duff. We understand some helicopters were used to drop water onto the fire to put the flames out, but it is moving incredibly quickly. Some drivers decided to abandon their vehicles and run away for their own safety. At the moment the authorities are saying there are no confirmed injuries. We will of course keep across that story and the latest of elements and bring those to you as we get them. The FBI says the gunman who attacked two military buildings in Tennessee on Thursday was carrying at least two long-barrelled guns and a handgun. Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez killed four marines before being shot dead. The FBI says it’s treating the attack as a terrorist incident and following seventy separate leads. But they’re still searching for a motive for the killings. Aleem Maqbool reports from Chattanooga. It is notjust people here who’ve been upset and shaken by these killings. It will awaken fears among many in this country. I hate that this has happened. I really didn’t think... I was worried, but I didn’t think it would hit home so soon and so fast. Ijust keep praying for them. It is sad. One of the victims was 1+0-year-old Thomas Sullivan, a marine who served two tours of duty in Iraq, and was a Purple Heart recipient. The others who were shot dead were also described by President Obama as men who served their country with great valour. The attack started here, where the gunman fired many shots into a military recruiting centre, before he moved on to a naval reserve facility. It is where the attacker himself was shot dead. The car he used left for forensics experts to pore over. But it is also where he killed the four Marines whose bodies were seen being escorted at speed out of Chattanooga. Their killer was Mohammed Youssef Abdulazeez, a US citizen born in Kuwait, one described as popular and funny. Officials now say he spent much of last year in the Middle East, and that it appears he acted alone. The threat is real, and it comes from the internet. This is a new generation of terrorist. This is not Bin Laden anymore. This is what the new threat of terrorism looks like. Well, what happened here is precisely what officials say they were most worried about, an attacker who in spite of all the surveillance didn’t raise suspicions, and stayed underthe radar, until suddenly appearing and taking lives. The problem is, for security agencies, that there are no easy solutions when it comes to trying to stop this happening again. More details have been emerging about the gunman, including his previous places of work. Correspondent has more on the FBI’s investigation. He did work at a nuclear power plant in Ohio for around ten days, and the company says they did not employ him after that period of time, but they won’t say why. So that is one of the loose ends that the FBI will want to be tying up. They have also said today that they have revealed some of the details, if you like, of the weapons that Mohammed Youssef Abdulazeez was carrying. He was carrying at least two long-barrelled guns, and at least one handgun, snd he was also wearing some clothing that allowed him to carry significant amounts of ammunition around with him. So he was out to do significant damage yesterday. They have also said that... They confirmed this report that had been floating around for 21+ hours that Abdulazeez had travelled abroad in the last few months. They said they were in touch with foreign intelligence services, and asking them for any details of his activities while he had been out of the country. Because of course, now they are treating this as a terrorist incident, terrorist enquiry. They want to know what the motivation was, whether it was related to Islamic State, or any form of kind of jihadist activity like that. So, quite a lot of things on the plate for the FBI to look at. They say they are looking at 70 separate leads at this stage, and of course this was also the day when the Pentagon released those names of those four marines, bringing into stark relief the true tragedy of this, because those people lost their lives here yesterday whilst trying to defend their country. Ceremonies have been held in the Netherlands and Ukraine to remember the victims of the Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 which was shot down a year ago. All 298 people on board were killed. 11+0 witnesses have been interviewed by a Dutch-led international, criminal investigation team. Tens of thousands of photos and videos have also been studied. Russian-backed rebels have been widely accused of firing the missile that caused the crash, something Moscow denies. Despite the tragedy, fighting continues in Eastern Ukraine from where Tom Burridge sent this report. In their village church, the people that witnessed the horror of the aftermath paid their respects to the innocent men, women and children on board, who were strangers to this community, which, a year on, is still trying to reconcile what happened. This video gives a sense of the carnage and chaos, just after the passenger plane was brought down. The pro-Russian rebel soldiers who filmed it are confused about what has happened. On that day, this woman heard the explosion, and saw parts of the plane drop out of the sky. But when she rushed home, she discovered that a woman’s body had fallen through her roof. Today, they honoured the dead. But finding out who was responsible for killing 298 innocent people in a war zone is a hugely complicated task. Away from the genuine sense of grief here, there is a poisonous climate of mistruth and propaganda in this region, linked to the ongoing conflict. So, even when the Dutch-led international investigation team decides what and who brought the plane down, the next hurdle is finding justice for those who died. 20-year-old Ben Pocock from near Bristol was on board the plane. His fatherjeremy says the British Government must continue to fight forjustice for all of the victims who died. We mustn’t lose sight of the fact that there were 80 children on that plane, including many babies. Whole families were wiped out, and there were numerous young adults, including Ben, who had reallyjust started their adult lives. And in the blink of an eye, he was gone. Today, the pro-Russian rebels in charge of this area made sure that lots of their flags were flying at an event of remembrance by the main crash site. This was an international tragedy. But Russia and the West back different sides in this region’s war, and they are unlikely to agree on who killed those on-board flight MH17, and how to implementjustice. Returning to our top story, the fire in California on the Interstate 15. These are the live images. It has caused a lot of disruption in the area. So far, no reports of injuries, but people are fleeing their vehicles on what is a busy road, connecting southern California and Las Vegas. joining us on the line is someone from the national forest service in California. Thanks for being with us. What can you see and hear from where you are? It was a fast moving fire that overtook the freeway and itjumped the a fast moving fire that overtook the freeway and it jumped the freeway and court multiple Kai-- cars and trucks on fire. We’ve seen these aerial images. What can you see of the firefighting efforts? What’s being done? Basically they were dropping buckets on the cars and aerial drops on the fire. How many vehicles can you see that are a light? Approximately over 20 cars that were totally destroyed and two more that were damaged. We also hear that some people’s homes have been evacuated. What more do you know about that? At least five structures were partially burnt and 50 are still in immediate danger. OK. David, thank you very much. David is from the national forest service. We will keep across the story and give you more when we get it. At least 100 people celebrating the end of Ramadan in Iraq have been killed by a car bomb, according to police. The bomb exploded in a busy market about 20 miles from the capital Baghdad in the town of Khan Bani Saad. Dozens of others were wounded in the blast. The Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has reshuffled his cabinet. He sacked several ministers who voted against the country’s economic rescue package. The measures were approved by an overwhelming majority on Wednesday. The German parliament has also given its approval for the deal. But there were angry exchanges in the debate, as the government insisted the bailout was needed to avoid chaos, but dozens of its own MPs voted against it. Our Europe editor Katya Adler, who’s in Berlin, explained that the detailed negotiations about the bailout can now begin. We have come a long way this week, since that stormy all-night meeting between Europe leaders, when there were rifts between key powers Germany and France. What brought Germany back from the brink then was the prospect of Europe divided and weak and over Greece. This country has invested hugely in the European project since World War II, as part of its European integration. So when the German Chancellor stood in front of parliament today, arguing for a third bailout over Greece, she did it in the name of European unity and German self-interest. She said if Europe is doing well, Germany does well as well. Now, it is interesting that while outside Germany, this country is criticised for not showing enough pity towards Greece, here at home, Chancellor Merkel has to persuade people she is not a soft touch. Germany is the biggest contributor to rescue packages for Greece, and that worries German taxpayers. But Angela Merkel’s secret weapon is her hard-line finance minister Wolfgang Schauble. His hardline stance on Greece led to him being described as Germany’s most popular politician, and if it weren’t for him, that rebellion inside Angela Merkel’s own party would have been far larger. Stay with us on BBC News. Still to come: Celebrating the end of Ramadan. We take a look at how the festival of Eid is being marked around the world. The flamboyant Italian fashion designer Gianni Versace has been shot dead in Florida. The multimillionaire was gunned down outside his home in the exclusive South Beach district of Miami. Emergency services across central Europe are stepping up their efforts to contain the worst floods this century. Nearly 100 people have been killed. Broadway is traditionally called the Great White Way by Americans but tonight it is completely blacked out. It’s a timely reminder to all Americans of the problems that the energy crisis has brought to them. 200 years ago today, a huge Parisian crowd stormed the Bastille prison, the first act of the Revolution which was to topple the French monarchy. Today, hundreds of thousands thronged the Champs Elysees for the traditional military parade. Finally, fairy penguins have been staggering ashore and collapsing after gorging themselves on a huge shoal their favourite food, pilchards. Some had eaten so much they could barely stand. This is BBC News. The latest headlines. US security services describe the shooting of four marines in Wildfires sweeping across the US state of California. The FBI says the shoe to who attacked two military installations in Tennessee was carrying at least two long barrelled guns and a hand. Fighters from the so-called Islamic State say they fired a guided missile at an Egyptian navy ship in the Mediterranean Sea. Pictures posted on social media appear to show the attack. A group calling itself Sinai Province, says it fired a rocket. Egypt’s Foreign Minister, Sameh Shoukry, says the country faces a growing threat from extremist groups. Speaking before the latest attack - he told the BBC’s Orla Guerin that recent bombings in the capital Cairo were more organised than those in the past. There have been attacks with home-made explosives with limited impact. This is a more defined and more planned and executed campaign which is definitely an effort to destabilise and terrorise the population. It is a continuous of a campaign which is not limited to Egypt, which is both regional and international. Do you see Islamic State as a growing threat for Egypt’s? I see all the terrorist organisations as a growing at. The Islamic State appears to be a trademark these days, because of its achievements in Iraq and Syria has a track had fringe splinter groups across the world. Are you concerned that we could see an attack in Esvpfs that we could see an attack in Egypt’s lack the massacre on the beaches of Tunisia? We are doing everything in our power to provide the necessary security for people. We have committed resources and people are vigilant. The security services have accepted that, of course. No country, no matter what its resources, European countries, a country like Egypt or anyone else can be totally immune from the terrorist attacks because of the nature. What would you say to the contention that what we have seen since the president took over as the clock being turned back conference of human rights and freedom of speech. Not at all. The Egyptian public are the only competent authority to make a demonstration in that regard. They are the ones who will value it. Their aspirations are being fulfilled and they are confident and content. Do you dispute the claims that prisons are bursting and thousands of people have been detained? They were accused and tried and convicted. We have people detained without charge, we have had a photographer detained for 700 days has not been charged. Whatever process within the legal process which allows this investigative period, it will carry out and he will be indicted or set free in accordance with the evidence. Do you accept that Egypt’s’s international reputation is exceedingly damaged? I accept there is a perception that is being advocated, but that does not relate to the existence of the streets. So everyone is wrong? There needs to be more accurate reflections. Any society, there are areas where improvements can be achieved, were we need to act with greater resolve and determination to apply the law and constitution. They will be at times excesses of an individual nature. But we need to recognise that some of those perceptions are somewhat exaggerated. South African paramedics say at least 250 people have been injured after two trains collided. None of the injured are believed to have beenin the injured are believed to have been in a critical condition. Because of the crash is yet known. The European Union as safety watchdog has said all climates should undergo psychological evaluations to prevent a repeat of the German means disaster. -- all pilots. -- German wings. And as bearing Braddock, who admitted to killing 70 people in Norway, has wanted to study politics at Oslo University. The university has admitted facing moral dilemmas about his admission. Here in Britain, The Sun newspaper has published a front page photograph showing the Queen and the Queen Mother apparently making Nazi salutes in the gardens of their Scottish Castle Balmoral in 1933.The paper says they were encouraged to do so by their uncle, Prince Edward, who was a Nazi sympathiser. A Palace spokesman said it was extremely disappointing that the film, shot eight decades ago, was being exploited in this manner. For more on the photo, I spoke to the BBC’s Royal correspondent Sarah Campbell. Makhmoor stunning new images of Pluto have been unveiled by the US space agency. There were captured by the new Horizons protocol which made history. Flying over Pluto’s icy plains. This is the latest image back from the New Horizons spacecraft. Apart from some troughs and hills, the surface is smooth and young. It hints that Pluto is still geologically active, something scientists thought a cold and distant world like this could never be. We have downloaded a lot of data. We have some big news and we will have some more big news next Friday when we have downloaded even more. I will have to tell you, I am a little bit biased, but I think the solar system has saved the best for last. These images have been such a long time coming. New Horizons set off 9.5 years ago and had to travel nearly 5 billion miles to the outer edge of the solar system. But the wait was worth it. For the first time, Pluto’s image has been revealed. Its pixelated moon so tiny. It is dwarfed by Pluto’s largest moon. Scientists are baffled by its mysterious dark spot, which they have nicknamed Mordor. Images of Pluto and science data will be sent to Earth for the next 16 months. Scientists say what we are seeing now is just the tip of the iceberg. Around the world Muslims are celebrating Eid al-Fitr, the festival that marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan. After weeks of fasting between dawn and dusk it is a chance to celebrate. The BBC’s Tim Allman has more. A sea of devotion. Hundreds of thousands of people performing the Eid prayer at the Grand Mosque in Mecca. Among them, the Saudi King. An extraordinary spectacle on a truly epic scale. It is all a little bit more low-key in Gaza, but amongst the rubble of buildings, the children are making the best of things. TRANSLATION: There are many districts where we live that are completely destroyed, so I want to shout out to the whole world that Palestinian children want to celebrate the festival of Eid in peace. In northern Iraq, thousands of people have fled their homes because of the battle against the so-called Islamic State, but even here, there are sweets, and presents, and smiles. Outside this mosque in Manhattan, more prayers, more devotion. But in what are tense times for many Muslims in the United States, there is a message as well. Some American people need to know the difference between terrorism and good Muslims. We are good Muslims. We will fight for America, we are here for America, because America has been good to us. And when we say God bless America, we mean it. The festival will continue over the weekend, Muslims around the world taking a moment to reflect, and to celebrate. Bringing you a reminder of our main news. In California, a fast moving bushfire has sent dozens of people fleeing from their cars on major motorways. The fire is burning multiple vehicles and has left hundreds, possibly thousands of motorists stranded in the desert. You can see these images live from the scene. Everyone trying to get away from the scene. Links thereby have also been evacuated. This is the main highway connecting southern California and lossmakers. Las Vegas. Hello, and welcome to the weekend. Some rain, some wind, but most of us will get at least one fine day out of it. Here is the big picture then for Saturday morning.

Fast-moving wildfires have swept across a motorway in California, setting several cars alight and forcing drivers to flee. Desert winds fanned the flames on the mountain pass, 55 miles north of Los Angeles. Parts of the road have been closed to traffic and helicopters are dropping water over the area. US security services have described the shooting of four marines in Tennesee as ""an act of terrorism"". Memorial services are being held for the victims, who were shot down at two military facilities in Chattanooga. Suspected gunman Muhammad Yussuf Abdulazeez was killed by police during a shoot-out. Ceremonies have been held in Ukraine and across the world to remember the victims of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, a year after it was shot down over Eastern Ukraine. All 298 people on board the plane were killed. Now on BBC News: The Week in Parliament. Hello and welcome to the Week in Parliament. On this programme: What’s it got to do with us? David Cameron on how Britain might be affected by the crisis in Greece. If Greece were, for instance, to leave the euro, and wanted humanitarian assistance, I’m sure that this House and the British public would take a more generous view. Hear no Evel. See no Evel. English Votes for English Laws stirs up plenty of anger in the Commons. What he hoped for was measures that would allow him, genuinely, to say that he and his colleagues were second-class MPs. They won’t be. The actions of this Parliament are against one party, the Scottish National Party. And, what’s wrong with letting 16-year-olds have the vote? There is some danger in giving the vote to those who have still got, in most cases, two years of full-time education ahead of them. But first: Uproar in Parliament! Fury in the chamber! No, not Westminster. The parliament in Athens. There were dramatic scenes in the chamber as the Greek Parliament debated and then voted to accept the terms of the latest massive 86 billion Euro bailout deal, struck at the start of the week by Eurozone leaders in Brussels. The controversial bailout agreement comes with a series of tough measures for the Greeks, such as rises in taxes and cuts in pensions. At Prime Minister’s Questions at the British Parliament, Labour’s Harriet Harman said the trauma the Greek people were going through was on a scale un-matched in Europe since the end of the Second World War. The agreement should be implemented in a way that is fair to the people of Greece as well as being acceptable to the creditors. It is being reported this morning that the IMF are concerned about whether the deal for Greece is in fact sustainable. Can the Prime Minister tell the House whether the Chancellor has had discussions with Christine Lagarde about how these concerns can be addressed? I think she is absolutely right to raise this and I think we all feel for the Greek people who have had a very difficult time with no early signs of relief on the way. We talk to the IMF on a very regular basis. The point they are making that there needs to be debt relief for Greece must be right. Does he agree though that with President Putin waiting in the wings, this is about more than just economics, there is wider geopolitical significance? What is his view about that? I think she is absolutely right. It’s not for Britain to bail out Eurozone countries and we wouldn’t do that but as a member of the European Union, if Greece were for instance to leave the euro and wanted humanitarian assistance, I’m sure that this House and the British public would take a more generous view, but sorting out the problems of the Eurozone, which we’ve always warned about the dangers of this Eurozone, is a matter for Eurozone countries, but he’s right about the dangers of Russian involvement. David Cameron. Now, it all sounded quite logical- English issues at Westminster being decided only by English Members of Parliament. The idea was in the Conservative election manifesto. But when the Government put forward its plans, known as Evel, English Votes for English Laws, they were quickly met with hostility. It would mean a change to voting procedures, with MPs from outside England barred from debates during the passage of an English Bill through Parliament. On Wednesday, the unhappy Scottish nationalists made their feelings known. Even I couldn’t conceive of a plan that would progress my vision against theirs. Imagine what we’ve seen in the past few weeks, ""Scotland stay with us, Scotland, we love you, you are part of the family of nations. Don’t leave us, they are valued members of this House."" Then the minute we get into this place, what happens, we are put into a second-class status. The honourable gentleman knows by having a simple consent of English members of parliament, no executive, knowing this Parliament, simply providing this consent to measure going through this place, his fox has been shot and what he hoped for, what he hoped for, those measures that would allow him genuinely to say that he and his colleagues were second-class MPs. They won’t be. They’ll be voting on everything. He knows he is right and he hates it. Opportunity to devolve powers comes by way of having an English Parliament. I would suggest that you are perhaps trying to have your cake and eat it at the same time. All the issues that had been raised, does the Leader of the House not recognise that actually you might as well do the work and have a permanent solution, but not this is, which is a hodgepodge. You need a parliament for England. We put proposals in our manifesto on which we were elected. And we will stick by that manifesto and we shall stick by that. Ultimately it is about fairness. We intend to give more powers to Scotland and Wales, devolve powers to Northern Ireland like corporation tax. We do not think that the Government’s proposals are wise. They are likely to put the union at risk. This will look internationally like it is partisan and against one party. The actions of this Parliament are against one party, the Scottish National Party. Can I suggest that when the SNP decide to vote against matters that will be devolved in Holyrood, that the Government gets a Bill to bring the power back to Scotland from Westminster? If the SNP want these things to be voted on in Westminster, surely we can help facilitate that and solve this problem once and for all. The view of MPs. And on Thursday, peers voiced their opinions about English votes for English laws. Several claimed that the plan hadn’t been thought through and might even lead to the breakup of the UK. The West Lothian question you know has become the Westminster question. And the Government is shaping it. What troubles me is this, it is the manner in which the Government seeks to involve a speaker in all of this, the definition of geographical boundaries is not as straightforward as it might seem. There are cross-border issues and the English-only Bill needs to be defined. Pushing a Speaker into the political cockpit to determine and divine legislation with the worst possible idea. It’s a recipe for discord and I believe it threatens both houses and the UK. The Government needs to think again and do so sharply. Ido believe the time has come for us to make some progress on actually implementing English votes for English laws. As I say, it has been debated many times over many years and we are and have been in pursuit of a perfect solution. I would put it to your Lordships that I don’t think there is a perfect solution to this question. But there has to be a way forward. Because it is becoming more and more urgent. The people of England feel the need for us to address this unfairness and this imbalance. Will my noble friend take account of what everyone in this House has thought about this, which is that we need to have a joint committee on both houses, to sort this out before we end up playing into the hands of the nationalists, fragmenting the union and the United Kingdom Parliament. Peers’ with thoughts on Evel, English Votes for English Laws. Looking at some of the other happenings around Westminster this week, here’s Duncan Smith. Parliament has opened an education centre, promising 100,000 visitors a year an immersive experience. With tales from Westminster’s history and apparently speaker john Bercow’s voice in the loos. Now, the job the whole world didn’t go for but Tim Farran did and he won, succeeding Nick Clegg to the Lib Dem leadership. He resigned after the party’s disastrous election showing. Meanwhile, the Labour leadership is creating a little bit more interest. This week, the candidates were on the Victoria Derbyshire show. She gave them a test. Can you sound like a human being? Have they passed the human being test, ladies and gentlemen? Hm, a bit more work to do there. The fox hunting debate went to ground this week after the SNP announced they would be setting their hounds against the government and would be boosting their anti-hunt forces. David Cameron’s fox was well and truly shot. 91-year-old Lady Knight still alive shock! A stunned House of Lords heard how reports of her demise turned out to be considerably exaggerated, much to everyone’s relief, particularly Lady Knight. ""She was found in the garden by Herb Gardener, ""who was convinced she was dead."" I’m sure that my noble friend will never die. She is clearly immortal. Duncan Smith. Now, demonstrations that get out of hand in London or in other cities on the UK mainland have never been been brought under control like this. Water cannon are a common enough sight overseas. But they’re controversial. In recent years their use has led to a number of injuries, particularly to eyes, in cities on the Continent. Water cannon have been used to disperse crowds in Northern Ireland, but they’ve never been deployed in the rest of Britain. London Mayor Boris johnson wanted them to be used in the capital. But on Wednesday came the Home Secretary’s verdict. I have taken the upmost care to ensure the testing and assessment, to the decision is made is as thorough and as a lot of as possible. On the basis of the evidence provided by both the police and the relative independent bodies, I can inform the House that I have decided not to authorise the 9000 water cannons as policing tactics for operational use in England and Wales. She gave the reason for her decision. Evidence suggests these cannons are unlikely to result in serious or life-threatening injuries, as currently used, the assessment nonetheless pointed to a series of direct and indirect risks and are used. These include possible secondary and tertiary injuries, including injuries such as spinal fractures as well as concussion, eye injury and blunt trauma. Can I remind herthat the decision was taken in light of the strong support of the metropolis for this operational control of the transport from the Prime Minister, and indeed the strong support of the people of London. It was expressed in a poll that found 68% were in favour. You’re watching the Week in Parliament. Still to come: Switch on or switch off? What should become of the BBC? On Tuesday came news that a Secure Zone was to be created at Calais for lorries heading for Britain. The idea, announced by the Home Secretary, is to stop trucks becoming targets for people attempting to enter the UK. At the Home Affairs Committee, MPs learned that some 5000 migrants are waiting in the French port to try to gain entry into Britain. Giving the figures to the committee was the Chief Constable of Kent. And he said the figure was growing. The problem is, there are 5000 of them sitting there waiting to become into the United Kingdom. I don’t know if they’re repeats. But there are 5,000. I hope I haven’t given the impression it is just industrial action that is the cause of this. Have you been over to Calais? Not recently. I was there some time ago seeing what the setup was like. Iam booked in, in the nearfuture, to go over again and review what is happening in Calais. The numbers have increased from january from 600 up to 3000. Presumably, they are not just all in the reception centre, they are all over the place. There were running onto motorways and going into depots, etc. The volume is increasing enormously, is it not? The volume is increasing enormously. The 5,000 figure I had this morning is growing. This is your new figure? This morning it was 5000. In Calais? In Calais itself and growing. I think the figure you cited yourself is the start point. There was 600 migrant in Calais estimated injanuary, there are now 5000. That increase is something which is continuing apace. And it is the simple volume which is causing the most difficulty for operators and it is causing the most difficulty on the roads and it is causing the most difficulty in terms of additional criminality in the area. We have never seen numbers like this before. And we have, not in the past scene in the degree of organisation that goes with these numbers either. There is a flow that comes from the countries of origin across the Sahara and the Mediterranean. The Government’s suffered a string of defeats in the House of Lords. Opposition peers, who easily outnumber Tory peers, inflicted seven defeats on parts of the Local Government Devolution Bill. One of those was on the age at which people can vote in English local elections. Peers backed a plan to move it from 18 down to 16. 16 and 17-year-olds were allowed to vote in the independence referendum in Scotland. A Lib Dem had a question for those doubtful about letting 16-year-olds vote. But despite that plea, peers voted by a majority of 67 in favour of lowering the voting age to 16. I believe myself that it is illogical in a country where it is not legal to drive a motor car, to consume alcohol, to smoke cigarettes at the age of 16 that young people should have the vote. I also believe that there is some danger in giving the vote to those who have still got, in most cases, two years of full-time education ahead of them. Now, if the honourable member were to talk about the need to change this, there is a proper place for this to happen. That is for the government to launch a wide basis of consultation. I think it would be appropriate for that to start in another place, which after all reflects the elected democracy of this country and I think it would not be appropriate for this house to try and impose upon the other place a suggestion of that sort. If you go back in history, Lord Curzon said in 1912, when we were talking about votes for women, women don’t have the experience to be able to vote. Look further back in history to the debate around the Reform Act of 1832. Landowners were saying only people who had land should be allowed to vote. Today, in 2015, those statements seem quite ridiculous. And to people who vote, I’m sure that in the future, it will also be seen as ridiculous. The noble Lords will know that the government has no plans to lower the minimum voting age. The voting age in most democracies, including most of the EU member states, is also 18. Only Austria in the EU allows voting for 16-year-olds. And the age of 18, not 16, is widely recognised as the age Despite the play, the peers voted against it. The TV licence has been funding the BBC since 191+6. Television production that was a small and simple what is the BBC make too many programmes? Are they too many channels? Is the BBC try to achieve too much? The process to review the BBC charter is about to start. The Government has appointed an advisory board to take a root and branch look at what the BBC does and how it’s funded. In the Lords, a former chair of the BBC Trust had some. Grave doubts about who’s on that advisory board. I wish I could feel more confident about what is going to happen in the future. The Secretary of State has appointed this grave diggers presumably buried the BBC we know and love. There is a prize is that despite all the collection of vested interest in which the right on all friend referred, despite that, we haven’t got Mr Murdoch on the committee, that would have made the future complete. My Lords, this year, we celebrate the 800th anniversary of Runnymede Wendy arbitrary use of power was first curtailed. It is plain we now need a Magna Carta for the BBC itself. So to Thursday when the Culture Secretary took MPs back to the 1990s. 20 years ago, we had five stations and it is now the largest public service will cost in the world with six radio stations, 1+0 local radio stations and a huge online presence. This charter review will look at whether this titular range of services best service licence fee payers. With so much more choice in watch to consume and how to consume it, we must question whether the BBC should be trying to be all things to all people, or if it should have more precisely targeted mission. Along with considering the mission and purpose of the BBC, we will consider whether the charter should also define its values and what value should be. The Secretary of State says we should consider the matter of universality, the universality of the BBC but surely the golden thread that runs through the concept of the BBC is that we all pay in and we should all get something out and that includes my constituents as well as his constituents, those who like Opera and those who like soap opera. I enjoy the launch of an endless stream of apps that seem to have very little public value and it seemed to me that the problem with that was that there was very little focus on what precisely the purpose of any specific product was. Does he agree with me that when it comes to services such as football on the BBC which would serve very well on commercial broadcasters versus the features section on the website, we should be a lot clearer about what the BBC is simply for. Missed last night the focus in this chamber of my experience or inexperienced in how this has operates. But in preparing to come to this House, I did watch a very good busy production, House of cards, the original version. I won’t put any stick about this afternoon but I did watch it through net flicks which costs £6 99 per month. When I watch BBC iPlayer I do it at £5 99 per month. It is still better value for me than the licence fee which I do not get a great benefit from. The green paper looks more others than I had feared. I expect more balance than the Murdoch press had hoped. But could he reassure my right honourable friend and his critics in the other place, senior Conservative politicians on the make-up of the advisory panel, which does seem very skewed with people who have been hostile to the BBC and how is the public, who after all other stakeholders of the BBC, going to be let into conversation? It is in the attention of the BBC trust to hold a number of public meetings and we hope the trust will be working to ensure that the public have every opportunity to input into the process. A Labour MP was close to tears this week as she spoke about the tragic case of Bobby and Christi Shepherd, the children who died because of a faulty boiler at holiday accommodation in Corfu in 2006. The two children suffered carbon monoxide poisoning. Mary Creagh, the family’s MP, said few would understand the agony suffered by parents who’d had such a desperate loss. There is a photo missing in Sharon and Neil’s homes. It is the photo of Christi on her prom night, dressed up, having fun with her friends. She would be 16 this year, waiting for her GCSE results and going to college for her A-levels. And another photo is missing - Bobby. He should be studying for his GCSEs, hanging out with his friends and playing with his brothers and sisters. All that joy, all that future, all that hope, all that life has been stolen from them. Their parents have told me they will never again have a perfect day. So, the powers that be, whether in this government or at Thomas Cook, should be in no doubt. And six months almost to the day before Bobby and Christi Shepherd died, were killed, my brother Edward was killed of carbon monoxide poisoning while abroad. So, I’m doubly grateful that this debate has been secured. Does my right honourable friend agree with me that if we had devices such as an audible CO alarm and raising that sort of issue is a concrete way that we can help to ensure that Edward Tomlinson’s family and the Shepherd family and other families would never have to go through this again. Now the relevant criminal proceedings and verdicts have been considered, I urge tourism operators across the UK to reflect on the lessons learned and be ever vigilant. Safety of tourists, both here and abroad, must come before all other concerns. Virtually every new Member of Parliament elected for the first time on the 7th of May has now made his, or her, maiden speech. When she came to do hers, a former deputy mayor of London made a very personal speech. Married to jamie for over 30 years, we have four wonderful children. Sadly, our two eldest were born with serious heart defects and our eldest son spent a great deal of time in hospital. Despite the excellent care, he was left with permanent disabilities. Forjamie and I, a great believer in the American maximum, if life gives you lemons, make lemonade. I know, Madam Speaker, that I am not alone in this chamber when I talk about the hours spent by bedside of a sick child or a loved one and the toll it takes on being a carer. So, I intend to work steadfastly here with others to represent the needs of the disabled, just as my husband takes up the cudgels for that campaign on the red benches. The Chancellor abolished any housing benefit for anyone below the age of 21 so we are now in the ridiculous situation whereby because I am an MP, not only am I the youngest but I am also now the only 20-year-old in the whole of the UK that the Chancellor is prepared to help with housing. Goodbye Mhari Black with a memorable maiden. And that’s it for this programme. A couple more days to go before Parliament breaks up for the summer. So dojoin me for our daily round-up of the Commons and the Lords on Monday and Tuesday. Until then, from me, Keith Macdougall, goodbye. Hello, and welcome to the weekend. Some rain, some wind, but most of us will get at least one fine day out of it. Here is the big picture then for Saturday morning. Low pressure to the north of Scotland, after a windy night. Still strong, gusty winds here to start the day. Still some wet weather around. Fine start elsewhere, weather fronts though waiting to come in to change things for part two of the weekend, on Sunday, as I will show you in a moment. This is how it looks, though, for the first part of Saturday morning. Notice the wind arrows in Scotland, still very gusty winds here. Lighter winds elsewhere, and as you can see, plenty of sunshine across southern England to begin the day. This is BBC News. A French Formula 1 driver has died from sustained injuries. The 25-year-old had been in a coma since last October, when he drove into a support vehicle. Questions were raised at the time about whether the car was to blame. He was seen as one of the sport’s brightest stars. We will bring you more on the death of jules Bianchi when we get it. A fast-moving wild fire has swept across a highway in southern California, engulfing vehicles and threatening several mountain communities. A number of cars are in flames on Interstate 15, which links Southern California and Las Vegas. Hundreds of firefighters are at the scene. So far more than 500 acres of land has been charred. David Cruz is from the San Bernardino, National Forest Service, in California. Basically it was a fast moving brushfire that overtook the freeway and itjumped the freeway brushfire that overtook the freeway and it jumped the freeway and and itjumped the freeway and set multiple cars and trucks on fire. Now it has actually burned into the area. They dropped water onto the side of the fire and also dropped buckets on to the cars. There were approximately 20 cars that were totally destroyed and ten more that were damaged. We’re also hearing that some people’s homes have been evacuated. What more do you know about that? At least five structures were partially burned and 50 are still in immediate danger. The FBI says the gunman who attacked two military buildings in Tennessee on Thursday was carrying at least two long-barrelled guns and a handgun. Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez killed four marines before being shot dead. The FBI says it’s treating the attack as a terrorist incident and following 70 separate leads. But they’re still searching for a motive for the killings. Aleem Maqbool reports from Chattanooga. It is notjust people here who’ve been upset and shaken by these killings. It will awaken fears among many in this country. I hate that this has happened. I really didn’t think... I was worried, but I didn’t think it would hit home so soon and so fast. Ijust keep praying for them. It is sad. One of the victims was 1+0-year-old Thomas Sullivan, a marine who served two tours of duty in Iraq, and was a Purple Heart recipient. The others who were shot dead were also described by President Obama as men who served their country with great valour. The attack started here, where the gunman fired many shots into a military recruiting centre, before he moved on to a naval reserve facility. It is where the attacker himself was shot dead. The car he used left for forensics experts to pore over. But it is also where he killed the four Marines whose bodies were seen being escorted at speed out of Chattanooga. Their killer was Mohammed Youssef Abdulazeez, a US citizen born in Kuwait, one described as popular and funny. Officials now say he spent much of last year in the Middle East, and that it appears he acted alone. The threat is real, and it comes from the internet. This is a new generation of terrorist. This is not Bin Laden anymore. This is what the new threat of terrorism looks like. Well, what happened here is precisely what officials say they were most worried about, an attacker who in spite of all the surveillance didn’t raise suspicions, and stayed underthe radar, until suddenly appearing and taking lives. The problem is, for security agencies, that there are no easy solutions when it comes to trying to stop this happening again. At least 100 people celebrating the end of Ramadan in Iraq have been killed by a car bomb, according to police. The bomb exploded in a busy market about 20 miles from the capital Baghdad in the town of Khan Bani Saad. Dozens of others were wounded in the blast. Stay with us on BBC News. Still to come: A suspected road rage incident and in the murder of this pensioner. Police arrest another motorist. The Sun newspaper has published a front page photograph showing the Queen and the Queen Mother apparently making Nazi salutes in the gardens of Balmoral in 1933. The paper says they were encouraged to do so by their uncle, Prince Edward, who was a Nazi sympathiser. A Palace spokesman said it was extremely disappointing that the film, shot eight decades ago, was being exploited in this manner. The BBC’s Royal correspondent Sarah Campbell says the picture will generate unwelcome headlines around the world. It is quite a shocking image. The Sun says in its editorial that it seems profoundly shocking. What the palace will be hoping people will do is put this picture into context. It is a still from this film that is about ten seconds long. It shows the family in the back garden, the girls, Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret in 1933. They are doing a highland jig. On a couple of occasions, they show this Nazi salute. Very briefly, arm up, palm down. It has taken on a context. It has a resonance that it did not have a 1933. Will it be embarrassing for Buckingham Palace, will they be upset that this image is out there? The answer must yes. Because of what we now know, what happened with the Hitler regime. It is worth stressing this is from the personal family archive. It has been exploited. There will be questions how this video has surfaced. The key thing is context. It was 1933, Princess Elizabeth was six years old. She was doing what her mother and uncle were doing in the garden of her house. Nobody is implying that anyone at that level had any sympathies in that direction. It was Mr Hitler in Germany, it was not Auschwitz it was not the Nazi party, it was not the Nazi youth movement. Absolutely. What palace sources have stressed to me is people have to take into context what the Queen has done over the subsequent 80 years, rather than a snapshot from a video taken back then. It also must be said that that uncle Edward was considered to be, there are legitimate questions about his Nazi sympathies. He did see Adolf Hitler against the advice of the British government four years after this video was shot. That is something people will contextualise. I am sure the palace will be hoping people do not fail to take into account what the Queen has done. It’s emerged that British pilots have been involved in carrying out air-strikes against so-called Islamic State targets in Syria. The UK Government has confirmed that up to 20 personnel are involved in the mission, embedded with American and Canadian forces. Two years ago, Britain’s Parliament voted against British military action there. Here’s our Security Correspondent, Frank Gardner. A US air strike hits an Isis target, an almost daily occurrence. US warplanes carry out air strikes across both Iraq and Syria. British warplanes are only authorised by Parliament to hit targets in Iraq, so the revelation that British pilots have been taking part in the US air strikes in Syria has surprised many. It has emerged that three Royal Navy and Royal Marine pilots have been flying in these aircraft, F/A-18s, from a US Navy aircraft carrier in the Gulf, part of a bilateral programme to keep up Royal Navy flying skills. The Defence Secretary has defended the policy. There’s a huge coalition effort going on to ensure that Isil is degraded and defeated, in both Iraq and in Syria. We don’t have at the moment Parliamentary authority to carry out military strikes in Syria, but the Americans do, and they have been, and they’ve been doing that to keep all of us safe. Two years ago, British MPs voted decisively against Britainjoining in planned US missile strikes against the Syrian regime. There is an important difference between the situation in Syria two years ago and now. Back then, Parliament voted against getting embroiled in Syria’s civil war. It didn’t want to start a conflict with that country’s government, headed by President Assad. But today, Britain is already at war with IS, so-called Islamic State, just across the border in Iraq. The orange area here shows their dominance across both Iraq and Syria. There have been extensive US-led air attacks against IS. These circles here show where they are concentrated. So, militarily, the border into Syria makes little difference. But politically, here at home, it does. Opposition figures say they have been kept in the dark. They want They wa nt an The Prime Minister needs to make an urgent statement about what’s happening. Parliament has been told about this and given the huge sensitivities around Britain’s role it is in -- extremely important. It is a dramatic revelation and extremely concerning. One issue is that the West has been involved in bombing in Syria and the second is whether the government is actively defying the will of Parliament and the vote two years ago. But if the Government gets its way, Britain’s military involvement will deepen even further. RAF planes like these ageing Tornadoes in Cyprus will soon join USjets in air strikes over Syria. But, given the reaction today, that could be harder to push through parliament. Four people are still missing after several large explosions at a wood mill in Cheshire. Another four people are in hospital, one with serious burns. The force of the blasts at Wood Treatment Limited in Bosley near Macclesfield shook nearby houses. judith Moritz reports. Curling above the countryside, plumes of smoke belched and billowed into the sky. Fire raged, ripping through the mill, the noise shattering the peace of a quiet Cheshire morning. Ijust heard this big, massive explosion, and it was like a fireball coming out of it. The ground was shaking, the walls were shaking, and as I turned back around, it was like another explosion went off. The sound was like somebody had burst my eardrum, it was that loud. The wood mill workers were just an hour into their morning shift. 35 people were caught in the explosion, with others living just yards away. It was a thick cloud of smoke coming over everything. Warren van Leeuwen’s cottage is right next door. I opened the door, and itjust looked like a war zone. It was just everything everywhere. It was just raining down, bits of shrapnel, if you like, bits of corrugated iron, wood and everything else. It was burning. A major incident was declared, with emergency workers scrambled from six counties. The most badly injured were airlifted to hospital, while searches continued for those who couldn’t be accounted for, their colleagues left waiting for news. just tell me what your worries are now. As long as me mates get out there alive, I aren’t bothered. What can you tell us about them? People you have worked with for a long time? Yes, very long time. Very worried. We have got one of them that hasn’t been found yet, and he was like a dad for me at work. That is why I have come up here now, to see what happened. The four-storey building collapsed completely, making the search difficult and dangerous. When you have two explosions within the building, the building splits open from the inside, and as a result of our firefighting tactics over the next two hours when the building collapses on itself. So it is extremely difficult and challenging for those fire crews. Rescue teams who worked on the Nepalese earthquake will search their way through this tomorrow. Tonight, livelihoods are gone. And it looks increasingly likely that lives have been lost as well. A man has been arrested after a pensioner was stabbed to death in a suspected road rage incident in West Sussex. 79-year-old Don Lock’s car was involved in a crash with another vehicle on Thursday night. Duncan Kennedy reports. Under a tree in the Sussex countryside, Don Lock’s close family gathered by the road where he died. There were flowers and embraces for the man who lost his life during a summer’s evening drive. His wife Maureen shared her heart-breaking tribute. He was a wonderful husband for 55 years. It was on the A21+ last night that medical teams tried to save Don Lock. Police said he had been involved in a suspected road rage incident with another driver, after he ran into the back of a man’s car. Moments later, Mr Lock was dead from multiple stab wounds. I went to the grass verge, and looked over to the reservation, and I could see this chap lying here. I took one look at him and I realised he was dead. This afternoon, armed police came to this area and arrested a man on suspicion of murder. They say they are not looking for anyone else in connection to this case. The arrest came as Mr Lock’s beloved cycling fraternity issued a statement. He had been a member of Worthing’s Excelsior Cycling Club for over 50 years. One member of the club, out riding tonight at the scene, said he had known Don for 1+0 years, and said he was the club’s inspiration. Don was such a nice man, always a sort of life-enhancing character, and a joy. I mean, it isjust a tragedy, a total tragedy, really. Don’s granddaughter Kirsty and daughter Sandra also came today, embraced in grief. His family said he had onlyjust been given the all-clear from cancer, and had been looking forward to welcoming his sixth great-grandchild. This is BBC News - the headlines. Wildfires have swept across a motorway in California, setting several cars alight and forcing drivers to flee. Desert winds fanned the flames on the road, which is 55 miles north of Los Angeles. US security services describe the shooting of four marines in Tennessee as an act of terrorism. Memorial services are being held for the victims who were shot down at two military facilities in Chattanooga. Memorials have been held around the world for the victims of Flight MH17, which was shot down over eastern Ukraine a year ago. All 298 people on board were killed. A Dutch-led investigation team has been working to try to determine who was responsible. Russian-backed rebels have been widely blamed for the attack, something Moscow denies. Tom Burridge has more. In their village church, the people that witnessed the horror of the aftermath paid their respects to the innocent men, women and children on board, who were strangers to this community, which, a year on, is still trying to reconcile what happened. This video gives a sense of the carnage and chaos, just after the passenger plane was brought down. The pro-Russian rebel soldiers who filmed it are confused about what has happened. On that day, this woman heard the explosion, and saw parts of the plane drop out of the sky. But when she rushed home, she discovered that a woman’s body had fallen through her roof. Today, they honoured the dead. But finding out who was responsible for killing 298 innocent people in a war zone is a hugely complicated task. Away from the genuine sense of grief here, there is a poisonous climate of mistruth and propaganda in this region, linked to the ongoing conflict. So, even when the Dutch-led international investigation team decides what and who brought the plane down, the next hurdle is finding justice for those who died. 20-year-old Ben Pocock from near Bristol was on board the plane. His fatherjeremy says the British Government must continue to fight forjustice for all of the victims who died. We mustn’t lose sight of the fact that there were 80 children on that plane, including many babies. Whole families were wiped out, and there were numerous young adults, including Ben, who had reallyjust started their adult lives. And in the blink of an eye, he was gone. Today, the pro-Russian rebels in charge of this area made sure that lots of their flags were flying at an event of remembrance by the main crash site. This was an international tragedy. But Russia and the West back different sides in this region’s war, and they are unlikely to agree on who killed those on-board flight MH17, and how to implementjustice. You say we have drastically reduced the amount of sugar we eat. -- new guidelines say. The head of NHS England has called on leading food retailers to raise the prices of sugary drinks. Sugar used to be a big deal in this family. Every night with our evening meal we had a lemonade on the table. We definitely cut back on that, we have it once a week now. Holly Taylor realised they were all consuming far too much sugar. She went on a nutrition course to find out what they should be eating and drinking instead. She has worked hard to make sure they have a healthy diet, cutting right back on sugar. What the new guidelines mean is you will not be able to have many snacks and fruits like this in a day before going over the recommended sugar limit. That means big challenges for all of us trying to work out what should be on the menu. We asked one of the experts involved in today’s report to design a sample meal plan with added sugar kept to a minimum. Breakfast was a banana and wheat biscuits, lunch a wholemeal roll, and for dinner, bean curry with a treat of chocolate mousse. She admits it will not be easy for everyone. It will require a cultural change in how we eat. These meals are doable, but they need planning, they need people to shop, to prepare, to cook the meals, to prepare foods they take with them to work or school. It is different to what we are doing at the moment. How responsible are those who sell sugary food and drink? Today the head of NHS England called on leading retailers to raise prices of these products to persuade consumers. If they reflect the cost of that, the prices they choose to charge, this could be a win-win. It will take pounds off the waistline of our children and pounds in the pockets of the income of low-paid employees. But some said it was an abuse of his position. Low sugar choices, they said, are widely available. With ministers set to launch a major obesity strategy in the autumn, the role of companies, consumers and the government will be debated. The politics of sugar are getting more bitter. More new stunning images of Pluto have been unveiled by the US Space Agency. They were captured by the New Horizons probe, which earlier this week made history by flying past this distant world. Our science correspondent Rebecca Morelle has been following the developments. Around the world Muslims are celebrating Eid al-Fitr, the festival that marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan. After weeks of fasting between dawn and dusk it is a chance to celebrate. A sea of devotion. Hundreds of thousands of people performing the Eid prayer at the Grand Mosque in Mecca. Among them, the Saudi King. An extraordinary spectacle on a truly epic scale. It is all a little bit more low-key in Gaza, but amongst the rubble of buildings, the children are making the best of things. TRANSLATION: There are many districts where we live that are completely destroyed, so I want to shout out to the whole world that Palestinian children want to celebrate the festival of Eid in peace. In northern Iraq, thousands of people have fled their homes because of the battle against the so-called Islamic State, but even here, there are sweets, and presents, and smiles. Outside this mosque in Manhattan, more prayers, more devotion. But in what are tense times for many Muslims in the United States, there is a message as well. Some American people need to know the difference between terrorism and good Muslims. We are good Muslims. We will fight for America, we are here for America, because America has been good to us. And when we say God bless America, we mean it. The festival will continue over the weekend, Muslims around the world taking a moment to reflect, and to celebrate. Thank you for being with us. Back in a moment with the headlines. First, the weather. Hello, and welcome to the weekend. Some rain, some wind, but most of us will get at least one fine day out of it. Here is the big picture then for Saturday morning. Low pressure to the north of Scotland, after a windy night. Still strong, gusty winds here to start the day. Still some wet weather around. Fine start elsewhere, weather fronts though waiting to come in to change things for part two of the weekend, on Sunday, as I will show you in a moment. This is how it looks, though, for the first part of Saturday morning. Notice the wind arrows in Scotland, still very gusty winds here. Lighter winds elsewhere, and as you can see, plenty of sunshine across southern England to begin the day. Should be plenty of bright, blue sky. A fresh start, temperatures gradually heading up, and it will feel warm in that sunshine by the afternoon. A bit of patchy cloud around for Wales, northern England, Northern Ireland. Quite windy, especially to the north. But the strongest, most gusty winds will be across Scotland. So a really blowy start. Clouds and outbreaks of rain still most persistent out towards the west. Now as that low pressure for northern Scotland begins to pull away, it takes its rain with it gradually through the day. Still some wet weather though in parts of Highland into the afternoon. Only slowly the wind easing, but it is still windy into the afternoon. Breezy elsewhere, a few showers pop up in parts of Northern Ireland, maybe north Wales, and north England. A cloudy spell of weather to come for most of you. Plenty of sunshine though across southern parts of Wales and England. This will see the warmest weather. Now, what does all of that mean for the golf at St Andrews? Could be some rain around first thing. It looks dryer as the day goes on, gets brighter too, but it is windy. Very gusty winds, that is the main challenge for the golfers. It will be late in the day before things start to improve. Those hoping for rain for the cricket won’t get any for Saturday. On Sunday, though, if there is still some play to be had, it is a different story, because as we go through Saturday night and into Sunday, those weather fronts start to come in. This is a picture on Saturday evening. Eventually, as you can see, we will see more persistent, heavy rain coming into Northern Ireland. And as we go on through the rest of the night, then more of us are going to see increasing cloud, and eventually these weather fronts move through, we get some outbreaks of rain. But do not write Sunday off at this stage. Whilst there is still a lot of uncertainty about the detail, it looks as if early rain does start to pull away, and actually, for many But, got plans on Sunday? Keep checking the forecast. The latest headlines from BBC News. Fast-moving wildfires have swept across a motorway in California, setting several cars alight and forcing drivers to flee. Desert winds fanned the flames on the mountain pass, 55 miles north of Los Angeles. Parts of the road have been closed to traffic, and helicopters are dropping water over the area. US security services have described the shooting of four marines in Tennesee as ""an act of terrorism"". Memorial services are being held for the victims, who were shot down at two military facilities in Chattanooga. Suspected gunman Muhammad Yussuf Abdulazeez was killed by police during a shoot-out. Ceremonies have been held in Ukraine and across the world to remember the victims of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, a year after it was shot down over Eastern Ukraine. All 298 people on board the plane were killed - relatives have demanded answers about who was responsible. The French Formula One driver has died from injuries he sustained during last year’s japanese died from injuries he sustained during last year’sjapanese Grand Prix. The 25-year-old had been in a coma since the accident last October when he drove into a support vehicle. Questions were raised at the time about whether the wet race course was to blame. jules Bianchi was seen as one of the sport’s brightest stars. In about ten minutes we’ll have this week’s edition of Newswatch, but first it’s time for Click. This week... Who are we, who are we? Not quite sure. We’re all wearing masks. But there will be crouching, rolling and is that dancing?! Sometimes, I think the latest technology can be a little too engrossing. Yeah, I could totally rob this place right now. They wouldn’t even know. Ha! This is NextVR in Laguna Beach, California. It is an outfit that specialises in streaming sports events in virtual reality to users of VR headsets around the world. When I dropped in, the US Open Golf Championships were the order of the day. I am standing on a grassy bank overlooking the US Open. I can see some spectators here. A guy with a sign, waving it around, that feels like it will clout me in the face! I am really up close and personal with the players, who are all having a bit of a swing. That must be the Goodyear blimp. Always good to see the Goodyear blimp. He’s taking his time. That’s the thing about golf, it’s a slow sport and you don’t know if the feed’s frozen or if that is what it looks like in real life! NextVR also deals in faster sports, giving fans the chance to experience something normally restricted to those blessed with great contacts or massive wallets - front row seats. The feeling of being next to the action with the freedom to look in any direction they want. This is the kind of set-up required to cover all the angles. A constellation of extremely wide-angle stereoscopic camera each shooting at an impressive 6K resolution. But capturing and delivering a decent 3D VR experience live is hard. The wraparound image can be 21+,000 pixels across and those watching it might be using mobile phone-based headsets over mobile networks running at fairly slow speeds. The challenge is to build an accurate representation of the world and do it quickly - fast enough so if a basketball player runs across acourt, we have an accurate map of that happening. For faster and more accurate 3D depth perception, the camera constellations also include two special light-filled cameras, which concentrate solely on depth information, resulting in images like this. Another trick to reducing the amount of data to be streamed is to send only a low resolution version of most of the view and a high resolution version ofjust the portion you are currently focusing on. And finally, for sports where all the action happens in front of you, NextVT will use only one pair of 3D cameras, reducing the field of vision to 180 degrees, but halving the size of the image. This is an underwater digital 3D system that captures in high enough resolution for an IMAX-size screen. One of the co-founders of the company is film-maker Dj Roller, who has produced and directed in some of the most extreme environments in the world. We talked about VR moving to other types of entertainment and in particular another problem with giving the audience a complete 360-degree view. Namely, where do you hide the production team? The very first time we tried to put something in a dramatic situation in a set, we thought, what is it going to be like? There is a crew behind you. The lights overhead. Most of the sets are built in Cad, in computers now, so to film the ceiling, the floors and the walls, you turn around in that dramatic piece and there is a wall behind you, not the camera crew. So the crew can be removed, but how will the performers fare? This kind of experience might usher in a particular type of actor. It is going to be interesting. It’s like when you went from silent movies to talking movies, there’s actors who were probably better performers in a silent film. The same thing for VR. The metre for acting is a whole other level. How you perform in VR might be a whole new set of actors that excel in VR. Giving yourself a spectator’s view of a sport or music event is a compelling and pretty obvious use of VR. And there are plenty of companies which are looking at different uses for VR, including the one that put it back on the map a few years ago with this, Oculus. We’ve been to see them in San Francisco. This is not my typical movie-going behaviour. Oh! Then again, I’m not watching a typical movie. I can see the moon. Canopy of trees. I’m in the midst of a thicket of towering trees, experiencing Lost, the first VR film from Oculus Story Studio. Story Studio’s a collection of artists and technicians who are trying to tell stories in virtual reality. Lost tells the story of an oversized mechanical hand that’s searching for its robot body. In a VR film like Lost, the viewer decides where they want to look, so the filmmaker has to create and animate every inch of the environment, whether it’s the full moon or the forest floor. Because we’re in a real-time game engine, we’re rendering on the fly, and so where you look determines where we’re rendering. A Pixarfilm is 21+ frames per second. It’s about 90 minutes long. And each frame for the final render takes about 50 hours for a computer to make, and I have 11 miliseconds. Still, the end result is so mesmerising, users could get, well, lost in the film. But Story Studio uses tricks to keep pacing. Once you look at the credits, we have a bird flutter right past you. What’s wonderful is people say, did I do that? Did Ifrighten the bird? And we have audio that will draw you to the correct location to look. The studio’s second film, Henry, debuts this summer. Henry’s this little spiky haired child who wants to get a hug. He just needs to find a friend. He is too spiky for everyone. If the shorts remind you of Pixar films, there’s good reason. The studio hired several from Pixar. The others are from DreamWorks and gaming companies. The work is similar to a degree, but VR has added constraints. Everything’s happening linearly around you. No matter where you look, the character’s still alive somewhere in the space. VR has caught Hollywood’s attention. Spike jones created a VR news film. Along with enthusiasm, though, there is scepticism. Lost was criticised for not exploring VR’s full potential. We don’t have the technology yet and it felt better to restrain ourselves a little bit. But I think with each new experience we make, we’ll try something new, we’ll try to add a different level of interactivity. A different narrative device, a different trick to get the audience’s attention and that’s what’s exciting about this. It feels like it’s research as well as making it. Every new medium has its challenges. Oculus acknowledges that motion sickness can occur and the longer you spend in VR the more likely you are to feel it. That could limit the length of films. With each film, though, VR inches towards the ultimate goal- a live action, hollow deck-like experience that takes you to another world. An animated character looking at me, that’s one thing. A human being looking right into my eyes, interacting with me, that’s not there with me, that’s a man on the moon moment. That’s the first telephone call. We’ve been talking a lot about VR, in case you haven’t noticed. You would not want to wear one of theseif You would not want to wear one of these if you were driving a real cut around the real track. Because that would be insane. Imagine being able to drive around but you would see it distorted visuals, you are playing a video game with a car you are driving. We drove a car with a virtual reality mask, navigating a course they have designed. It was a dynamic course with obstacles that were moving and flying at me and sort of like a game where I am trying to reach the end of the game. Things arejumping at trying to reach the end of the game. Things are jumping at you and trying to reach the end of the game. Things arejumping at you and coming out of the ground and we had hands jumping out, we had the ways that you see. We had all of these obstacles popping up and he had to move through them in order to make sure that he didn’t crash in the game. When you crash in the game, as much as you are physically crashing, your brain sees a crash, so you almost hit the brakes. I would be driving off course in the game but I was OK in the real world, which was crazy. Physically, it felt nauseating. We started with a 2015 Mustang, pulled all of the data we could, the throttle, steering angle, brake pressure, the car is the game controller. We have GPS and IMUs, XL matters, which tells your phone which direction you are going, but the steering comes injust like if you have a regular game controller in your hand and you were hitting the trigger or the A and B at an. The gas is a controller, the brake pedal is a controller, and they can project into the world what the car is doing, so it is quite crazy. And, yeah, please go ahead and try it at home. That is it for the shorter version of Click. The full-length version is available on iPlayer right now. We have to leave Laguna Beach in California and head straight back to London... In a little while. Hello and welcome to Newswatch with me, Samira Ahmed. Coming up on the programme: Google has made it harder to find some BBC News website stories. What is the BBC doing about the so-called right to be forgotten? And, how is the Corporation doing in the delicate task of reporting on the debate about its own future? First, though, how many times have we heard that Greece’s economic crisis is reaching its endgame? This was another such week with a third bailout deal agreed by Eurozone leaders, only to be criticised by the International Monetary Fund and angry confrontations on Wednesday both inside and outside the parliament in Athens. Bruce Parsons was watching the BBC’s coverage and had this point to make. Another viewer, who contacted us about this, was Robert Hallens. Here is what he had to say, along with a reminder of seven of the BBC correspondents we spotted reporting from Greece this week. Behind me, the Acropolis. The palpable legacy of Athens at the heart of its pomp and power. I was watching various news broadcasts and it seemed a bit odd to me the number of correspondents that were sent out to Athens. It really came to a head when Robert Peston appeared to give a brief financial analysis of the situation, which I and my wife felt could basically have done the same job back home. There is a bit of rioting going on. We are all supposed to be in the time of austerity. I think everyone should look at saving money where they can. I mean, with modern communications, is it really necessary to have someone on the ground actually being there? Thanks to Robert Hallens for those comments, which we put to BBC News. They told us this. Last week we featured complaints that a news bulletin had been moved more than an-hour-and-a-half earlier than scheduled because of BBC One showing live coverage instead of an Andy Murray match at Wimbledon, so that the viewers tuning in for the news at the advertised time found that they had already missed it. Not everyone was on the side of those objecting, though. Nikki Watts writing. Well, before we leave the Wimbledon scheduling debate for another year, there were more clashes between tennis fans and news buffs over the weekend and last Friday, after another Andy Murray match caused disruption for at least one viewer. Hi, it’s Keith Morris. Why isn’t the news switched from BBC One to BBC Two. It’s just to fit in the tennis on the flagship channel, as they put it. The tennis is already scheduled for BBC Two so why not put it on there? Why mess up all those people who pre-recorded the tennis and pre-recorded the news? BBC schedulers are idiots. So I think the news people should tell them, BBC One, 6:00pm, the news, whatever. The debate over the future of the BBC continued to rage this week, with the publication of the Government’s green paper on the Corporation’s future, and a fightback against recent attacks by director-general Lord Hall. And through an open letter from star supporters of the BBC urging the Prime Minister not to diminish the organisation. It is, of course, a tricky issue for BBC News to cover, but Newsnight did so on Thursday evening with a debate between the BBC’s Director of Strategyjames Purnell and the Daily Mail columnist Stephen Glover. I think it’s wrong for one institution to be so dominant, and it’s particularly irritating that the BBC is often centre-left. The BBC is not dominant. We’ve gone down from being about half of the broadcasting market to now being less than a fifth. We’re going to go down further than this. We would love to persuade the Daily Mail, who said this week, they had a soft spot for the BBC, to have a soft splash. Because this is one of the great things about Britain... I have got a soft spot. Daily Mail readers use the BBC for 22 hours a week more than the average. They think the BBC is the most impartial news source in the country. And we would like to persuade the Daily Mail to love us even more. Nobody’s doubting the BBC is a great national institution. The question is whether it is too big. Forjudith Austin from Dorset the discussion generated more heat than light. Well, both the Government and the BBC have said they want to hear the views of members of the public in the year-and-a-half running up to the renewal of the Corporation’s charter. One way you can make those known is by contacting Newswatch, and I’ll give you details of how to do so at the end of the programme. If you’ve been searching for a BBC News website story on Google over the past year you may have found that the link to it has been removed. Following a ruling by the European Court ofjustice in May 2011+, known as the right to be forgotten, anyone can request that search engines remove certain web pages from searches if, for instance, they relate to something criminal, or even just embarrassing which they have done. Since then, Google has removed almost 1+0,000 such links, and the BBC has now started publishing the list of its news pages which have been removed from Google’s search results. Well, the managing editor of BBC Online Neil McIntosh is with me to explain more. Neil, can you explain what has changed for BBC News and the BBC News website because of this ruling? Well, since this ruling last year, what is happening is that people can now write to Google through a form on their website and suggest that a piece of content is de-linked from a search term using their name. And as a consequence, many types of BBC content won’t show up in the search. So what we’re seeing now, and we get a list from Google every month, around 210 BBC articles have been impacted in the past year and that number’s going up every month. The search for a name might not come up on Google, so you can still find the stories? Yes, it’s important to say the content isn’t being removed from the BBC archive. It’s not even being completely removed from Google’s index. What’s happening is that the link is being removed from a certain search term. And I’ve been looking at a list of links the BBC has put up, and it is a lot of stories, more than 200 in the last year. What sort of stories are we talking about? We’re seeing a lot of court coverage. An interesting thing here is that coverage of court by necessity has to be extremely accurate, fact-driven, so these things are not being removed from the search term because they’re inaccurate, and we’re seeing stories of people caught doing unpleasant things. There’s a manslaughter case in there, there’s a case of a workman doing something particularly unpleasant in someone’s loft. There are cases of employees being suspended from hospital trusts while under investigation, so a whole host of stories relating to crime or alleged crime. Now, the BBC has made the decision in the past month to go public about the issue. And you’re going to publish a monthly list of these stories as they keep being added to. Why have you decided to do that? We’ve decided to do it first and foremost really as an addition to the debate around the public policy of this. We find that something has happened quite quietly, but it may be of interest to many of the people who use the BBC, licence fee payers who pay for the BBC that certain articles could be in a search one day and gone the next. It’s also important to note we are extremely firm on the reason we would remove something from our own archive, and that’s not happening in this case, but we do feel that if it becomes harder to find stories in an archive, some of that purpose is being served. Is there any room for negotiation? just because someone requests a removal of a link, does it automatically have to happen? No, so Google are supplying a set of rules, and other search engines as well although we’re not hearing as much from those search engines about what they’re removing, but the process is entirely closed. Google aren’t referring back to us to check on the nature of the story, we don’ learn who’s requested the take-down, and we don’t really understand the cause of that take-down. We can speculate as to the potential reason, we can speculate as to the identity, but in the end that’s only speculation. In the end, this whole ruling came about because of a right to privacy and people feeling that their privacy is being compromised. What would you say? One of the challenges around a right to privacy that’s often forgotten is the need to balance that right with the right to free expression. And you could also argue that an individual’s right to be forgotten has to be balanced with the public’s right to remember that things happened. If you’re seeing routes to remembering what happened in the past being closed, you could argue those rights are being infringed, so I think you need to find a balance about this, and experts do acknowledge that there is a middle ground that has to be found between what can be competing rights. Some viewers watching this discussion might feel quite angry and concerned about stories being covered up. Some of these convictions are for terribly violent or serious crimes, like fraud and manslaughter. Are you concerned about it? It’s certainly one of the reasons we’re raising this now. We feel the public has a right to remember what happened in the past and not to have those archives lost. It’s a little bit like going into a library and not cutting articles out of the archives, but certainly scratching out names on an index card. It makes it that much harder to find out what happened in the past, and that’s our concern. Neil McIntosh, thank you. Thanks for all your comments this week.

We’ll be back to hear your thoughts about BBC news coverage again next week. Goodbye. Hello, and welcome to the weekend. Some rain, some wind, but most of us will get at least one fine day out of it. Here is the big picture then for Saturday morning. Low pressure to the north of Scotland, after a windy night. Still strong, gusty winds here to start the day. Still some wet weather around.

But do not write Sunday off at this stage. Whilst there is still a lot of uncertainty about the detail, it looks as if early rain does start to pull away, and actually, for many of us, things begin to improve. That is particularly the case on Sunday, we think, across the northern half of the UK. You start to see some sunny spells, still a few showers in Scotland. We keep a lot of cloud though to the south, and we could well see some further outbreaks of rain coming back in from the south-west later in the day. But, got plans on Sunday? Keep checking the forecast. Welcome to BBC News, broadcasting to our viewers on public television in the US and around the globe. I’m Ben Bland. Our top stories: Wildfires sweep across a California mountain pass, setting cars alight and forcing drivers to flee the flames. The FBI says the shooter who attacked two military installations in Tennessee was carrying at least three guns. The French Formula 1 driver jules Bianchi has died from injuries sustained during last year’sjapanese Grand Prix. Hello. A fast-moving wild fire has swept across a highway in southern California, engulfing vehicles and threatening several mountain communities. A number of cars are in flames on Interstate 15, which links Southern California and Las Vegas. Hundreds of firefighters are at the scene. So far more than 500 acres of land has been charred. David Cruz is from the San Bernardino, National Forest Service, in California. Basically it was a fast moving brushfire that overtook the freeway and itjumped the freeway and set multiple cars and trucks on fire. Now it has actually burned into the Maldy Mesa area. They dropped water onto the main fire and also dropped buckets onto the actual cars that were burning. There were approximately 20 cars that were totally destroyed and ten more that were damaged. We’re also hearing that some people’s homes have been evacuated. What more do you know about that? I have at least five structures were partially burned and 50 are still in immediate danger. At least a hundred people celebrating the end of Ramadan in Iraq have been killed by a car bomb, according to police. These are the latest pictures we have seen from the Reuters news agency. They have not been independently verified but are believed to show the scene of the blast. The bomb exploded in a busy market about 20 miles from the capital, Baghdad, in the town of Khan Bani Saad. Dozens of others were wounded in the blast. The FBI says the gunman who attacked two military buildings in Tennessee on Thursday was carrying at least two long-barrelled guns and a handgun. Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez killed four marines before being shot dead. The FBI says it’s treating the attack as a terrorist incident and following seventy separate leads. But they’re still searching for a motive for the killings. Aleem Maqbool reports from Chattanooga. It is notjust people here who’ve been upset and shaken by these killings. It will awaken fears among many in this country. I hate that this has happened. I really didn’t think... I was worried, but I didn’t think it would hit home so soon and so fast. Ijust keep praying for them. It is sad. One of the victims was 1+0-year-old Thomas Sullivan, a marine who served two tours of duty in Iraq, and was a Purple Heart recipient. The others who were shot dead were also described by President Obama as men who served their country with great valour. The attack started here, where the gunman fired many shots into a military recruiting centre, before he moved on to a naval reserve facility. It’s where the attacker himself was shot dead. The car he used left for forensics experts to pore over. But it’s also where he killed the four Marines whose bodies were seen being escorted at speed out of Chattanooga. Their killer was Mohammed Youssef Abdulazeez, a US citizen born in Kuwait, one described as popular and funny. Officials now say he spent much of last year in the Middle East, and that it appears he acted alone. The threat is real, and it comes from the internet. This is a new generation of terrorist. This is not Bin Laden anymore. This is what the new threat of terrorism looks like. Well, what happened here is precisely what officials say they were most worried about, an attacker who in spite of all the surveillance didn’t raise suspicions, and stayed underthe radar, until suddenly appearing and taking lives. The problem is, for security agencies, that there are no easy solutions when it comes to trying to stop this happening again. More details about the gunman have been emerging, including his previous places of work. Our correspondent Gary O’Donoghue has more on the FBI’s investigation. He did work at a nuclear power plant in Ohio for around ten days, and the company says they did not employ him after that period of time, but they won’t say why. So, that’s one of the loose ends that the FBI will want to be tying up. They’ve also said today that they’ve revealed some of the details, if you like, of the weapons that Mohammed Youssef Abdulazeez was carrying. He was carrying at least two long-barrelled guns, and at least one handgun, and he was also wearing some clothing that allowed him to carry significant amounts of ammunition around with him. So he was out to do significant damage yesterday. They have also said that they would confirm this report that had been floating around for 21+ hours that Abdulazeez had travelled abroad in the last few months. They said they were in touch with foreign intelligence services, and asking them for any details of his activities while he had been out of the country. Because of course, now they are treating this as a terrorist incident, terrorist enquiry. They want to know what the motivation was, whether it was related to Islamic State, or any form of kind of jihadist activity like that. So, quite a lot of things on the plate for the FBI to look at. They say they’re looking at 70 separate leads at this stage, and of course this was also the day when the Pentagon released those names of those four marines, bringing into stark relief the true tragedy of this, because those people lost their lives here yesterday whilst trying to defend their country. The French Formula 1 driver jules Bianchi has died from injuries he sustained during last year’sjapanese Grand Prix. The 25-year-old had been in a coma since the accident in Suzuka last October, when he drove into a support vehicle. Questions were raised at the time about whether the wet race course was to blame. Bianchi was one of the sport’s brightest stars. Firefighters in Greece are battling wildfires on the eastern outskirts of the capital. Some locals have had to flee their homes and several villages were evacuated in the Peloponnese as wildfires burned through rural land. The BBC’s Mark Lowen has more. They tore through the forest, destroying everything in their way. Flames darting through the hills, acrid smoke billowing above. Emergency services sprung into action, using all means to bring the flames under control. Vast areas were sprayed from the air. Every few minutes they tried again. From the centre of Athens, the scale is clear. The Greek parliament, which the world has watched for the last fortnight, now in focus for a different reason. Greece has requested help from Europe, this time not financial, but to battle the fire. All through the morning they’ve been dousing the flames from above. The air still hangs thick with smoke. Here on the ground, locals are trying to defend their properties by rinsing the area with water in order to stop any sparks or ash from getting close to their homes. Anything they ask for me and for us, they go for help. They are not prepared for those huge fires. They aren’t prepared. Are you worried about what is happening? Yes, it is my house here. Of course I am worried. Soaring temperatures and high winds make Greece prone to fires. Eight years ago they killed dozens. For now, these are less serious, but they could build fast. Quenching the flames took the power out nearby, as pylons were hit. But still the fires flare, yet another fight that Greece is waging and another it is struggling to win. Some breaking news. The Reuters news agency is reporting that a tsunami warning has been issued after a powerful earthquake near the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific. According to the US Geological Survey the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 was centred 75 kilometres north-west of Lata, 600 kilometres from the capital, Honiara. We will monitor that and bring you updates on that story as they develop. It’s emerged that British pilots have been involved in carrying out air-strikes against so-called Islamic State targets in Syria. The UK Government has confirmed that up to 20 personnel were involved in the mission, embedded with American and Canadian forces. Two years ago, Britain’s Parliament voted a gainst military action there. Here’s our security correspondent, Frank Gardner. A US air strike hits an Isis target, an almost daily occurrence. US warplanes carry out air strikes across both Iraq and Syria. British warplanes are only authorised by Parliament to hit targets in Iraq, so the revelation that British pilots have been taking part in the US air strikes in Syria has surprised many. It’s emerged that three Royal Navy and Royal Marine pilots have been flying in these aircraft, F/A-18s, from a US Navy aircraft carrier in the Gulf, part of a bilateral programme to keep up Royal Navy flying skills. The Defence Secretary has defended the policy. There’s a huge coalition effort going on to ensure that Isil is degraded and defeated, in both Iraq and in Syria. We don’t have at the moment Parliamentary authority to carry out military strikes in Syria, but the Americans do, and they have been, and they’ve been doing that to keep all of us safe. Two years ago, British MPs voted decisively against Britainjoining in planned US missile strikes against the Syrian regime. It’s clear to me that the British Parliament, reflecting the views of the British people, does not want to see UK military action. I get that, and the Government will act accordingly. There is an important difference between the situation in Syria two years ago and now. Back then, Parliament voted against getting embroiled in Syria’s civil war. It didn’t want to start a conflict with that country’s government, headed by President Assad. But today, Britain is already at war with IS, so-called Islamic State, just across the border in Iraq. The orange area here shows their dominance across both Iraq and Syria. There have been extensive US-led air attacks against IS. These circles here show where they are concentrated. So militarily, the border into Syria makes little difference. But politically, here at home, it does. Opposition figures say they have been kept in the dark. I’m quite shocked that this has happened without a statement before Parliament, or at least a discussion. I’m not in favour of us being involved in this war. But if the Government gets its way, Britain’s military involvement will deepen and RAF planes like these ageing Tornadoes in Cyprus will soon join USjets in air strikes over Syria. But Parliament will need to be consulted first. The Sun newspaper has published a front page photograph showing the Queen and the Queen Mother apparently making Nazi salutes in the gardens of Balmoral in 1933. The paper says they were encourage to do so by their uncle, Prince Edward, who was a Nazi sympathiser. A Palace spokesman said it was extremely disappointing that the film shot eight decades ago was being exploited in this manner. Stay with us on BBC News.

Desert winds fanned the flames on the road, which is 55 miles north of Los Angeles. The FBI says the shooter who attacked Chattanooga in Tennessee was carrying at least three guns. US security services describe the shooting of four marines in Tennessee as an act of terrorism. Fighters from the so-called Islamic State say they fired a guided missile at an Egyptian navy ship in the Mediterranean Sea. Pictures posted on social media appear to show the attack. A group calling itself Sinai Province says it fired a rocket. Egypt’s Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry says the country faces a growing threat from extremist groups. Speaking before the latest attack, he told the BBC’s Orla Guerin that recent bombings in the capital Cairo were more organised than those in the past. There have been attacks which have been limited, have been home-made explosives with limited impact. So this is a more defined and more planned and executed campaign, which is definitely an effort to destabilise and terrorise the population to change direction. I see it as a continuation of a campaign which is not limited to Egypt, which is both regional and international. Do you see the so-called Islamic State as a growing threat for Egypt? I see all the terrorist organisations as a growing threat. The Islamic State seems to be a trademark these days, because of its achievements in Iraq and in Syria it has attracted fringe and splinter groups across the world. Minister, are you concerned that we could see an attack in Egypt like the massacre which happened on the beach in Tunisia? We are doing everything in our power to provide the necessary security for people and for our touristic sites. We have committed resources and people are vigilant in the security services. Having said that, of course, no country, no matter what its resources, European countries, a country like Egypt or anyone else, can be totally immune from the terrorist attacks because of the natures. What would you say, Minister, to the contention that what we have seen since the president took over is the clock being turned back on human rights, freedom of speech, on the freedoms that were won during the revolution? Not at all. The Egyptian public are the only competent authority to make a demonstration in that regard. They are the ones who will value it. Their aspirations are being fulfilled and they are confident and content. But do you dispute the claims that prisons are bursting and thousands of people have been detained? Whoever were detained were detained because they were accused and tried and convicted. We have people detained without charge, we have had a photographer detained for 700 days has not been charged. Whatever process within the legal process which allows this investigative period, then it will carry out and he will be indicted or set free in accordance with the evidence that will be gathered. But do you accept that Egypt’s international reputation is exceedingly damaged by a climate of repression? I accept there is a perception that is being advocated, but that does not relate to the existence on the streets. So everybody is wrong? No, I don’t contend that everybody is wrong, but there needs to be more accurate reflections. In any society, there are areas where improvements can be achieved, where we need to act with greater resolve and determination to apply the law and constitution. There will be in times excesses of an individual nature. But we need also to recognise that some of those perceptions are somewhat exaggerated. Egypt’s Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, speaking with our Cairo correspondent Orla Guerin. Memorials have been held in the Netherlands and Ukraine to remember the victims of the Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, which was shot down over eastern Ukraine a year ago. All 298 people on board were killed. Russian-backed rebels have been widely accused of firing the missile that caused the crash, something Moscow denies. Tom Burridge sent this report. In their village church, the people that witnessed the horror of the aftermath, when a Malaysia Airlines plane was shot down, paid their respects to the innocent men, women and children on board, who were strangers to this community, which, a year on, is still trying to reconcile what happened. This video gives a sense of the carnage and chaos, just after the passenger plane was brought down. The pro-Russian rebel soldiers who filmed it are confused about what has happened. On that day, this woman heard the explosion, and saw parts of the plane drop out of the sky. But when she rushed home, she discovered that a woman’s body had fallen through her roof. Today, they honoured the dead. But finding out who was responsible for killing 298 innocent people in a war zone is a hugely complicated task. Away from the genuine sense of grief here, there is a poisonous climate of mistruths and propaganda in this region, linked to the ongoing conflict. So, even when the Dutch-led international investigation team decides what and who brought the plane down, the next hurdle is finding justice for those who died. 20-year-old Ben Pocock from near Bristol was on board the plane. His fatherjeremy says the British Government must continue to fight forjustice for all of the victims who died. We mustn’t lose sight of the fact that there were 80 children on that plane, including many babies. Whole families were wiped out, and there were numerous young adults, including Ben, who had reallyjust started their adult lives. And in the blink of an eye, he was gone. Today, the pro-Russian rebels in charge of this area made sure that lots of their flags were flying at an event of remembrance by the main crash site. This was an international tragedy. But Russia and the West back different sides in this region’s war, and they are unlikely to agree on who killed those on-board flight MH17, and how to implementjustice. More new, stunning images of Pluto have been unveiled by the US Space Agency. They were captured by the New Horizons probe, which earlier this week made history by flying past this distant world. We have already seen some images of the distant world and its via satellites. They give strong indications that Pluto and its main moon have been active in the recent past. The new images rig reveal a vast mountain range -- new images reveal a vast mountain range, formed relatively recently, compared to the age of the solar system. Around the world, Muslims are celebrating Eid al-Fitr, the festival that marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan. After weeks of fasting between dawn and dusk, it is a chance to celebrate. The BBC’s Tim Allman has more. A sea of devotion. Hundreds of thousands of people performing the Eid prayer at the Grand Mosque in Mecca. Among them, the Saudi King. An extraordinary spectacle on a truly epic scale. It is all a little bit more low-key in Gaza, but amongst the rubble of destroyed buildings, the children are making the best of things. TRANSLATION: There are many districts where we live that are completely destroyed, so I want to shout out to the whole world that Palestinian children want to celebrate the festival of Eid in peace. In northern Iraq, thousands of people have fled their homes because of the battle against the so-called Islamic State, but even here, there are sweets, and presents, and smiles. Outside this mosque in Manhattan, more prayers, more devotion. But in what are tense times for many Muslims in the United States, there is a message too. Some American people need to know the difference between terrorism and good Muslims. We are good Muslims. We will fight for America, we are here for America, because America has been good to us. And when we say God bless America, we mean it. The festival will continue over the weekend, Muslims around the world taking a moment to reflect, and to celebrate. Let’s bring you an update on that raking use this sour. The powerful earthquake which has hit near the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific. According to the USG geopolitical survey the 7.5 magnitude tremor was centred 7.5 kilometres north-west of Lata, near the capital Honiara.

And you can get in touch with me and most of the team on Twitter. I’m @BenMBland. Hello, and welcome to the weekend. Some rain, some wind, but most of us will get at least one fine day out of it. Here is the big picture then for Saturday morning. Low pressure to the north of Scotland, after a windy night. Still strong, gusty winds here to start the day. Still some wet weather around. Fine start elsewhere, weather fronts though waiting to come in to change things for part two of the weekend, on Sunday, as I will show you in a moment. This is how it looks, though, for the first part of Saturday morning. Notice the wind arrows in Scotland, still very gusty winds here. Lighter winds elsewhere, and as you can see, plenty of sunshine across southern England to begin the day. Should be plenty of bright, blue sky. A fresh start, temperatures gradually heading up, and it will feel warm in that sunshine by the afternoon. Bit of patchy cloud around for Wales, northern England, Northern Ireland, quite windy, especially to the north. But the strongest, most gusty winds will be across Scotland. So a really blowy start. Clouds and outbreaks of rain are still most persistent towards the west. Now, as that low pressure for northern Scotland begins to pull away, it takes its rain with it gradually through the day. Still some wet weather though in parts of Highland into the afternoon. Only slowly the wind easing, but it is still windy into the afternoon. Breezy elsewhere, a few showers pop up, parts of Northern Ireland, maybe north Wales, and north England. Fairly hit and miss, but a cloudier spell to come for those of you. Plenty of sunshine though across southern parts of Wales and England. This will see the warmest weather. Now, what does all of that mean for the golf at St Andrews? Could be some rain around first thing. It looks dryer as the day goes on, gets brighter too, but it is windy. Very gusty winds, that is the main challenge for the golfers. It will be late in the day before things start to improve. Those hoping for rain for the cricket won’t get any for Saturday. On Sunday, though, if there is still some play to be had, it is a different story, because as we go through Saturday night and into Sunday, those weather fronts start to come in. This is a picture on Saturday evening. Eventually, as you can see, we will see more persistent, heavier rain coming into Northern Ireland. And as we go on through the rest of the night, then, more of us are going to see increasing cloud, and eventually these weather fronts move through, we get some outbreaks of rain. But do not write Sunday off at this stage. Whilst there is still a lot of uncertainty about the detail, it looks as if early rain does start to pull away, and actually, for many of us, things begin to improve. That is particularly the case on Sunday, we think, across the northern half of the UK. You start to see some sunny spells, still a few showers in Scotland. We keep a lot of cloud, though, to the south, and we could well see some further outbreaks of rain coming back in from the south-west later in the day. But, got plans on Sunday? Keep checking the forecast. The latest headlines from BBC News. I’m Ben Bland. Fast-moving wildfires have swept across a motorway in California, setting several cars alight and forcing drivers to flee. Desert winds fanned the flames on the mountain pass, 55 miles north of Los Angeles. Parts of the road have been closed to traffic, and helicopters are dropping water over the area. The FBI says the shooter who killed four marines at two military installations in Tennessee was carrying at least three guns. US security services have described the shooting in Chattanooga as ""an act of terrorism"". 21+-year-old Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez was killed by police. The French Formula 1 driver jules Bianchi has died from injuries sustained during last year’sjapanese Grand Prix. The 25-year-old had been in a coma since an accident last October, when he collided with a crane being used to pick up another crashed car. A man has been arrested after a pensioner was stabbed to death in a suspected road rage incident in West Sussex. 79-year-old Don Lock’s car was involved in a crash with another vehicle on Thursday night. Duncan Kennedy reports. Under a tree in the Sussex countryside, Don Lock’s close family gathered by the road where he died. There were flowers and embraces for the man who lost his life during a summer’s evening drive. His wife Maureen shared her heart-breaking tribute. He was a wonderful husband for 55 years. It was on the A21+ last night that medical teams tried to save Don Lock. Police said he had been involved in a suspected road rage incident with another driver, after he ran into the back of a man’s car. Moments later, Mr Lock was dead from multiple stab wounds. I went to the grass verge, and looked over to the reservation, and I could see this chap lying here. I took one look at him and I realised he was dead. This afternoon, armed police came to this area and arrested a man on suspicion of murder. They say they are not looking for anyone else in connection to this case. The arrest came as Mr Lock’s beloved cycling fraternity issued a statement. He had been a member of Worthing’s Excelsior Cycling Club for over 50 years. One member of the club, out riding tonight at the scene, said he had known Don for 1+0 years, and said he was the club’s inspiration. Don was such a nice man, always a sort of life-enhancing character, and a joy. I mean, it isjust a tragedy, a total tragedy, really. Don’s granddaughter Kirsty and daughter Sandra also came today, embraced in grief. His family said he had onlyjust been given the all-clear from cancer, and had been looking forward to welcoming his sixth great-grandchild. Now on BBC News, Our World. Over the last ten years thousands of children have fled war-torn Afghanistan. Many are trafficked into the UK. Is Britain home? Yes. The government offers them a life in the UK often with foster families. Childhood often has a chance of. This is a boy who needs my support -- chance. As their childhood ends at the age of 18, so does their right to stay in the UK. They are pawns in this political process. For seven months I have followed some of those who have made a life in the UK and now face deeply -- deeply patient to one of the most dangerous countries in the world. -- deportation. We have heard the parliament building was attacked by the Taliban. The UK government says the asylum policy is there. This is ours in that light. -- our life. These all right? Yes. Good. This lifeguard is a local hero. He has saved the lives of two children here. But the bathers he watches over are unaware he’s about to be kicked out of the United Kingdom. His crime is that he’s not from these parts, despite his regional Midlands accent. OK, guys, would you like some floats? juma learned to swim in the rivers that flowed through his village in northern Afghanistan. He fled when he was 11 years old, when his village in a Taliban stronghold was attacked. Since 2006, 5500 Afghan children entered the UK alone, without their parents, and claimed asylum. At 18 hours GMT, welcome to the newsroom. I’m Danny Cox. A day of violence in Afghanistan kills more than 20 people. juma is still haunted by the conflict in his homeland. He may be safe, but he has no idea what became of his parents and siblings. Mark, jodie and their children have been his family for the last five years. Many child asylum seekers are offered a chance for childhood with British foster families. This photo was took actually two weeks after I arrived. It was my first holiday. We went to Blackpool. That’s probably the first thing you did that a 13, 11+-year-old should be doing, in three and a half years? Having fun, I suppose? It’s not a thing you can get in Afghanistan, do you know what I mean? So it was really, really different. It was shocking. This is really good, do you know what I mean? There’s so much negativity about asylum seekers. ""Oh, he’ll be much older than he is making out, he could be Al-Qaeda, who knows what he is?"" If they engage with the family, they become part of the family. And I thinkjuma definitely clearly came from a loving, caring family. Butjuma could soon be going back. This is a boy who needs my support. So, from then, he is my boy. Like most Afghan children who come to Britain alone, his case for asylum was rejected when he first arrived. We’ve discovered that since 2006, 80% of Afghan child asylum seeker cases are rejected. But they are offered a temporary life here. They’re placed in the care of local authorities until they become adults. Whenjuma turned 18, he had to reapply for asylum. His request was refused again. He now faces deportation. To actually get the refusal was a complete shock, and I wasjust... It’sjust so upsetting, 'cause it puts every... You realise then, ""Right, we’ve got a fight on."" When I’ve built my life yet, I built everything here. Suddenly somebody comes and takes it from me. That’s not right. They will argue that they’ve looked after you as a child, they protected you, it’s time for you to go home. But the war is not over. I’ve built my life here. Is this home for you now, rather than Afghanistan? Yeah. You consider this home? Not Afghanistan? No. We’re all living under a bit of a cloud, you know? And we go through the motions of things, we do birthday parties, we’ve done funerals. If I thought for one minute he was going to go back and we could keep in contact with him, and he’d be safe and he could make a living and make a family and make a life for himself in Afghanistan, that would be OK. I don’t feel that. NEWSREAL: Coming up, more than 30 dead and 100 injured as a suicide bomber strikes jalalabad in Afghanistan. The group Islamic State says it was responsible. In another British town, another foster parent fighting for failed child asylum seekers. This was my lovely present, it’s got Mum on it. From the age of 11+, Najib grew up in Leamington spa with Linda, but he’s already gone. You don’t stop caring just because they turn 18. Najib was deported to Afghanistan two years ago. Linda still supports and financially. -- Linda still supports him financially. Ido think he’s been sent back wrongly. Without my money, what would become of him? He wouldn’t be able to sleep anywhere, he would have nowhere to sleep, he would have no food to eat, he wouldn’t have the money to communicate with me. I feel that they are pawns in this political process. He’s a number, so that anybody who wants to get political gain can say, ""we have sent this many people back."" Linda faces more heartache. Another foster son, Faisal, faces deportation any day now. Your client’s application has been refused for the reasons given. He’s been removed from Linda’s foster care and placed in temporary accommodation. When I’m alone I feel really bad, like crying and stuff. But I can’t do anything. But the good thing is I’m safe here, that’s the only thing, I’m happy, I’m safe. I ask myself, and I’ve asked these MPs, and I’ll ask anybody who’ll listen to me, ""if you’ve got a son and a daughter, how ""desperate would you have to be to send them halfway round the world?"" Hello. Salaam. Faisal and his friend check-in with Linda’s other foster son, Najib. He’s in an internet cafe in Afghanistan’s capital, Kabul. But away from the banter, knowing Faisal could be joining him, Najib has a warning. I receive refuse from Home Office, so, I don’t know. They say, ""Go back to your country."" I don’t know, man, what to do now. Faisal could appeal his deportation, but he’s gone on the run. Fearing he could be picked up by immigration officers, he stays on the move. Campaigners accuse Britain of effectively warehousing Afghan children, dismissing their claims of persecution in Afghanistan with the clear intention of deporting them when they become adults. Since 2011, more than 600 failed child asylum seekers have been deported back to Afghanistan, according to figures obtained by the UK’s Bureau of Investigative journalism, and nearly 500 more are earmarked for removal. This is despite official advice from the British government warning its own citizens that it’s dangerous to travel to Afghanistan. NEWSREEL: A British security worker is among three people killed by a car bomb in the Afghan capital. NWESREEL: Most of the casualties were passing Afghans - children, women and men. I’ve come here to find out what happens to young men forced to restart their lives in a country scarred by endless conflict. What strikes me about Kabul is life just goes on around you as normal. Children going to school, people selling fruit at market stalls, but the military presence, be it armed police or the army, is a permanent reminder that this is a city on the edge - the Taliban can strike any time, anywhere. This road hasjust been closed, and we’ve just heard that the parliament building has been attacked by the Taliban. The Taliban attacks politicians, the military and anyone or anything to do with the Western world. Those facing deportation from the UK to Afghanistan often argue they could be targeted because they’ve become westernised. So, where your family live, it is too dangerous? I’ve managed to track down Linda’s foster son, Najib. After two years back in the country of his birth, he’s had enough. I don’t want to stay in Afghanistan. I want to leave Afghanistan. Even if they keep sending me back, still I keep going. The wealthy countries like Britain can’t look after everyone. That’s why you got sent back. That’s the argument for sending you back. I haven’t stayed in Afghanistan, I haven’t been in Afghanistan for a long time, so... Actually, at the moment, still I don’t know the proper culture. Army helicopterjust passing by, two army helicopters. Of course, it is dangerous, as you can see. While we are filming, we hear more deportees have been forced onto a plane to Kabul by the UK Government. We managed to track down one of those on board. All I know is that he is 23, he is called Nessar, and after years fighting deportation, he arrived in Kabuljust four days ago. Nessar lived in North London for eight years, and now he is here. He hasn’t left this room on the outskirts of Kabul since he got here. In my mind, I’m not happy here. Because I was there eight, nine years. I coming here, I’m feeling like I’m crazy here. Who I am here, what I’m doing here. He is paying rent with money he brought from London, but it’s running out. In this country, how... How... How I going to make my life? How should I run my life? I can’t go outside. I can’t be safe here. What can I do here? By myself, alone? Thinking, oh, this is our life. This is not a life. He has been told there is help to find work from a UK Government supported organisation. We offered to take Nessar there with our security team. It’s the first time he’s seen the streets of Kabul since he was ten years old. I’m shocked. People are in the street, cars in the street, horses in the street. Look, everybody is in one street. It’s... It’s much different here. Because of security fears, we’re not allowed to film inside this deportee support centre. It was recently attacked by the Taliban. Hello, they said we can’t help you for the job. But I’m... I want to look for a job, to find a job as soon as possible that keeps me busy, you know? To keep me... You know, the thing is, it’s hard to find a job in here. Really hard. There’s a lot of people begging. BÃggiflg, YOU CSI’] SEE. A lot of unemployment. You can see people are struggling. Does that worry you? Yes, too much. Yeah. PHONE RINGS. Hi, hi, it’s Chris. Back in Britain, and about to get to know another former child asylum seeker. 20-year-old Hayat wants to speak to me from his cell. He is being detained, ready for deportation, but he’s prepared to die first. So this is much more than a cry for help, you are prepared to go all the way? Hayat says he’s convinced he’ll be killed the Taliban in Afghanistan. But is his greatest fear perhaps losing the life he has in Britain? He spent much of his childhood in foster care in a sleepy seaside town on the southern coast of England. Hayat’s best friends are Sam and Charlie. I just can’t believe what’s happened. When I saw him, I mean, he’s probably been over a month without food and he definitely looks like he has. And Ijust told him to eat. I thought if I could persuade him to eat then he could get himself back on track. And I thought I did, untill heard that that didn’t work. When you are 18, you don’t really anticipate getting yanked out of everything you know, do you? But this is a country divided over how it should manage migration, and the deportation of asylum seekers like Hayat. On the phone and on BBC radio Kent today, we’re off to Sittingbourne Festival. Michael is waiting to talk to us. This is another typical BBC sob story. He got here with no documents at all, so how did he get in in the first place? I want to bring in Nancy in Sidcup. He’s become very westernised, and what would he do in Kabul? I think all Afghanistan men should go home. Someone needs to fight the Taliban, and it doesn’t need to be English and Americans. But itsjudges in courts who decide their fate. Back in Birmingham, lifeguard juma is appealing to a judge to reopen his asylum case. I’m a little bit nervous, I don’t know what’s going to happen today. I believe we’ll get the right result that we need. The judge asks for several weeks to make up his mind. March 2015, and Hayat has been moved to Harmondsworth Immigration Removal Centre, ready for his flight to Kabul. He remains on hunger strike. A government-chartered plane is due to leave, with nearly 80 deportees on board. Protests break out. Hayat’s fellow inmates refuse to return to their cells. Many are also on hunger strike. just as Hayat is boarding the plane, he and 18 other deportees are taken off the flight on the orders of a High Courtjudge in light of escalating violence in Afghanistan. A victory for human rights campaigners, for now. Two months later, Hayat is released from detention back to the place he calls home. You can’t imagine how glad I was, cos on the way to a report they have provided me with some sort of sandwich and water, and Ijust refuse to drink and eat. But as soon as I... Ijust started to eat and drink. When I got released and I gave calls to Sam and Charlie, they were very, very happy. I really missed them too, you know? I don’t want to lose them. But Hayat’s relief is short-lived. Weeks later, deportations resume. The UK Government declined our request for an interview, but in a statement they said... All the young Afghan men I have met fighting their deportation claimed they not only the Taliban persecution, they also argue it’s inhumane to send them to a country where they have no future. There is no clear evidence of that than here, a notorious bridge over the River Kabul. Here, we found hundreds of Kabul’s poorest injecting heroin to numb their pain and hopelessness. I mean, you can see there are hundreds of people under that bridge. This is as miserable and as desperate as it can get for anybody in this city. Among them, I am told, are many of the UK’s failed child asylum seekers. The charity workers that led me here say deportees either escape Afghanistan and head back to Europe, or escape reality by taking drugs. In this desperate community, we find 21+-year-old Ahmed. He says he lived in Manchester for eight years. He has been back in Kabul, living with his mother, for 18 months. Hello, and welcome to the weekend. Some rain, some wind, but most of us will get at least one fine day out of it. Here is the big picture then for Saturday morning. Low pressure to the north of Scotland, after a windy night. Still strong, gusty winds here to start the day. Still some wet weather around. Fine start elsewhere, weather fronts though waiting to come in to change things for part two of the weekend, on Sunday, as I will show you in a moment. This is how it looks, though, for the first part of Saturday morning. Notice the wind arrows in Scotland, still very gusty winds here. Lighter winds elsewhere, and as you can see, plenty of sunshine across southern England to begin the day. Should be plenty of bright, blue sky. A fresh start, temperatures gradually heading up, and it will feel warm in that sunshine by the afternoon. Bit of patchy cloud around for Wales, northern England, Northern Ireland, quite windy, especially to the north. But the strongest, most gusty winds will be across Scotland. So a really blowy start. Cloud and outbreaks of rain are still most persistent towards the west. Now, as that low pressure for northern Scotland begins to pull away, it takes its rain with it gradually through the day. Still some wet weather though into parts of Highland into the afternoon. Only slowly the wind easing, but it is still windy into the afternoon. Breezy elsewhere, a few showers pop up, parts of Northern Ireland, maybe north Wales, northern England. Fairly hit and miss, but a cloudier spell to come for those of you. Plenty of sunshine though across southern parts of Wales and England. This will see the warmest weather. Now, what does all of that mean for the golf at St Andrews? Could be some rain around first thing. It looks dryer as the day goes on, gets brighter too, but it is windy. Very gusty winds, that is the main challenge for the golfers. It will be late in the day before things start to improve. Those hoping for rain for the cricket won’t get any for Saturday. On Sunday, though, if there is still some play to be had, it is a different story, because as we go through Saturday night and into Sunday, those weather fronts start to come in. This is a picture on Saturday evening. Eventually, as you can see, we will see more persistent, heavier rain coming into Northern Ireland. And as we go on through the rest of the night, then, more of us are going to see increasing cloud, and eventually these weather fronts move through, we get some outbreaks of rain. But do not write Sunday off at this stage. Whilst there is still a lot of uncertainty about the detail, it looks as if early rain does start to pull away, and actually, for many of us, things begin to improve. That is particularly the case on Sunday, we think, across the northern half of the UK. You start to see some sunny spells, still a few showers in Scotland. We keep a lot of cloud, though, to the south, and we could well see some further outbreaks of rain coming back in from the south-west later in the day. But, got plans on Sunday? Keep checking the forecast. Hello. A fast-moving wild fire has swept across a highway in southern California, engulfing vehicles and threatening several mountain communities. A number of cars are in flames on Interstate 15, which links Southern California and Las Vegas. Hundreds of firefighters are at the scene. So far more than 500 acres of land has been charred. David Cruz is from the San Bernardino, National Forest Service, in California. Basically it was a fast moving brushfire that overtook the freeway and itjumped the freeway and set multiple cars and trucks on fire. Now it has actually burned into the Baldy Mesa area. buckets onto the actual cars that were burning. So they’re protecting structures. There were approximately 20 cars that were totally destroyed and ten more that were damaged. We’re also hearing that some people’s homes have been evacuated. What more do you know about that? I have at least five structures that were partially burned and 50 are still in immediate danger. At least 100 people celebrating the end of Ramadan in Iraq have been killed by a car bomb, according to police. These are the latest pictures we’ve received from the Reuters news agency. They haven’t been independently verified but are believed to show the scene of the blast. The bomb exploded in a busy market about 20 miles from the capital Baghdad in the town of Khan Bani Saad. Dozens of others were wounded in the blast. The French Formula 1 driver jules Bianchi, who’s been in a coma since a crash at last year’s japanese Grand Prix, has died. He sustained severe head injuries in the crash in October and passed away in hospital in the south of France. He was 25-years-old. japan’s Grand Prix circuit last October. A car has collided with a safety vehicle. Course marshals and doctors are frantically trying to help the driver who has been badly injured. That driver is French -- Frenchmanjules Bianchi, one of the rising stars of Formula 1. He suffered serious head injuries that date and had been in a coma ever since. Now a statement from his family on social media and the worst news possible. The family said: jules Bianchi was born in Niece. Motor racing had been in his blood. He had been a test driver for Ferrari, a reserve driver for force India. Even then you could send his ambition. It will be a great season for me. We’ve seen the car and it looks really great. I can’t wait to drive. He made his full debut in Formula 1 with Marussia in 2013, winning with a ninth place finish in Monaco last year. Off the track his looks, charm and talent suggested he could have been a huge star. His deathis could have been a huge star. His death is the first on a Formula 1 track since 1991+. The loss ofjules Bianchi a shocking blow to a family and an entire sport. Now a look at some of the day’s other news. South African paramedics say at least 250 people have been injured after two trains collided injohannesburg during the evening rush hour. None of the injured are believed to be in a critical condition. The cause of the crash isn’t yet known. The European Union air safety watchdog has said all pilots should undergo psychological evaluations to prevent a repeat of the Germanwings disaster, when a co-pilot intentionally crashed a passenger jet killing all those on board. It said the results should be shared on a European database. You can get in touch with me and most of the team on Twitter. Stay with us on BBC News. Still to come: Giant discoveries on the dwarf planet. NASA releases new photos of Pluto, revealing mountain ranges on its surface that may be 100 million years old. It’s emerged that British pilots have been involved in carrying out air-strikes against so-called Islamic State targets in Syria. The UK Government has confirmed that up to 20 personnel were involved in the mission, embedded with American and Canadian forces. Two years ago, Britain’s Parliament voted against military action there. Here’s our Security Correspondent Frank Gardner. A US air strike hits an Isis target, an almost daily occurrence. US warplanes carry out air strikes across both Iraq and Syria. British warplanes are only authorised by Parliament to hit targets in Iraq, so the revelation that British pilots have been taking part in US air strikes in Syria has surprised many. It’s emerged that three Royal Navy and Royal Marine pilots have been flying over Syria in American aircraft, F/A-18s, from a US Navy aircraft carrier in the Gulf, part of a bilateral programme to keep up Royal Navy flying skills. The Defence Secretary has defended the overall policy. There’s a huge coalition effort going on to ensure that Isil is degraded and defeated, in both Iraq and in Syria. We don’t have at the moment Parliamentary authority to carry out military strikes in Syria, but the Americans do and they have been and they’ve been doing that to keep all of us safe. Two years ago, MPs voted against combat action in Syria, but that was before IS came on the scene. There is an important difference between the situation in Syria two years ago and now. Back then, Parliament voted against getting embroiled in Syria’s civil war. It didn’t want to start a conflict with that country’s government, headed by President Assad. But today, Britain is already at war with IS, so-called Islamic State, just across the border in Iraq. The orange area here shows their dominance across both Iraq and Syria. There have been extensive US-led air attacks against IS. These circles here show where they are concentrated. So militarily, the border into Syria makes little difference. But politically, here at home, it does matter. Opposition figures say they have been kept in the dark. They want an immediate explanation. Well, I think the Prime Minister needs to make an urgent statement about what’s happening. We’ve never been told this. Parliament has not been told this. And given the huge sensitivities around Britain’s role in terms of both Iraq and Syria, it’s extremely important. Well, it’s a dramatic revelation. It’s extremely concerning. There are two issues, of course. One is the wisdom of being involved in bombing in Syria, but the second and more pertinent issue is whether the Government is actively defying the will of Parliament in the vote two years ago. If the Government gets its way, Britain’s military involvement will deepen even further. RAF planes like these ageing Tornadoes in Cyprus will soon join USjets in air strikes over Syria. But given the reaction to today’s revelations, that may now be harder to push through Parliament. Four people are still missing after several large explosions at a wood mill in Cheshire. Another four people are in hospital, one with serious burns. The force of the blasts at Wood Treatment Limited in Bosley near Macclesfield shook nearby houses. judith Moritz reports. Curling above the countryside, plumes of smoke belched and billowed into the sky. Fire raged, ripping through the mill, the noise shattering the peace of a quiet Cheshire morning. Ijust heard this big, massive explosion, and it was like a fireball coming out of it. The ground was shaking, the walls were shaking, and as I turned back around, it was like another explosion went off. The sound was like somebody had burst my eardrum, it was that loud. The wood mill workers were just an hour into their morning shift. 35 people were caught in the explosion, with others living just yards away. It was a thick cloud of smoke coming over everything. Warren van Leeuwen’s cottage is right next door. I opened the door, and itjust looked like a war zone. It was just everything everywhere. It was just raining down, bits of shrapnel, if you like, bits of corrugated iron, wood and everything else. It was burning. A major incident was declared, with emergency workers scrambled from six counties. The most badly injured were airlifted to hospital, while searches continued for those who couldn’t be accounted for, their colleagues left waiting for news. just tell me what your worries are now. As long as me mates get out there alive, I aren’t bothered. What can you tell us about them? People you have worked with for a long time? Yes, very long time. Very worried. We have got one of them that hasn’t been found yet, and he was like a dad for me at work. That is why I have come up here now, to see what happened. The four-storey building collapsed completely, making the search difficult and dangerous. When you have two explosions within the building, the building splits open from the inside, and as a result of our firefighting tactics over the next two hours when the building collapses on itself. So it is extremely difficult and challenging for those fire crews. Rescue teams who worked on the Nepalese earthquake will search their way through this tomorrow. Tonight, livelihoods are gone. And it looks increasingly likely that lives have been lost as well. A man has been arrested after a pensioner was stabbed to death in a suspected road rage incident in West Sussex. 79-year-old Don Lock’s car was involved in a crash with another vehicle on Thursday night. Duncan Kennedy reports. Under a tree in the Sussex countryside, Don Lock’s close family gathered by the road where he died. There were flowers and embraces for the man who lost his life during a summer’s evening drive. His wife Maureen shared her heart-breaking tribute. He was a wonderful husband for 55 years. It was on the A21+ last night that medical teams tried to save Don Lock. Police said he had been involved in a suspected road rage incident with another driver, after he ran into the back of a man’s car. Moments later, Mr Lock was dead from multiple stab wounds. I went to the grass verge, and looked over to the reservation, and I could see this chap lying here. I took one look at him and I realised he was dead. This afternoon, armed police came to this area and arrested a man on suspicion of murder. They say they are not looking for anyone else in connection to this case. The arrest came as Mr Lock’s beloved cycling fraternity issued a statement. He had been a member of Worthing’s Excelsior Cycling Club for over 50 years. One member of the club, out riding tonight at the scene, said he had known Don for 1+0 years, and said he was the club’s inspiration. Don was such a nice man, always a sort of life-enhancing character, and a joy. I mean, it isjust a tragedy, a total tragedy, really. Don’s granddaughter Kirsty and daughter Sandra also came today, embraced in grief. His family said he had onlyjust been given the all-clear from cancer, and had been looking forward to welcoming his sixth great-grandchild. The FBI says the gunman who attacked two military buildings in Tennessee on Thursday was carrying at least two long-barrelled guns and a handgun. Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez killed four marines before being shot dead. The FBI says it’s treating the attack as a terrorist incident and following 70 separate leads. But they’re still searching for a motive for the killings. Aleem Maqbool reports from Chattanooga. It is notjust people here who’ve been upset and shaken by these killings. It will reawaken fears among many in this country. I hate that this has happened. I really didn’t think... I was worried, but I didn’t think it would hit home so soon and so fast. Ijust keep praying for them. It’s sad. One of the victims was 1+0-year-old Thomas Sullivan, a marine who served two tours of duty in Iraq, and was a Purple Heart recipient. The others who were shot dead were also described by President Obama as men who served their country with great valour. The attack started here, where the gunman fired many shots into a military recruiting centre, before he moved on to a naval reserve facility. It’s where the attacker himself was shot dead. The car he used left for forensics experts to pore over. But it’s also where he killed the four Marines whose bodies were seen being escorted at speed out of Chattanooga. Their killer was Mohammed Youssef Abdulazeez, a US citizen born in Kuwait, who one described as popular and funny. Officials now say he spent much of last year in the Middle East, and that it appears he acted alone. The threat is real, and it comes from the internet. This is a new generation of terrorist. This is not Bin Laden anymore. This is what the new threat of terrorism looks like. Well, what happened here is precisely what officials say they were most worried about, an attacker who in spite of all the surveillance didn’t raise suspicions, and stayed underthe radar, until suddenly appearing and taking lives. The problem is, for security agencies, that there are no easy solutions when it comes to trying to stop this happening again. This is BBC News - the headlines. Wildfires have swept across a motorway in California, setting several cars alight and burning at least five homes. Desert winds fanned the flames on the road, which is 55 miles north of Los Angeles. The FBI says the shooter who attacked two military installations in Tennessee was carrying at least three guns. US security services have described the killing of four marines on Thursday as an act of terrorism. Memorials have been held around the world for the victims of Flight MH17, which was shot down over eastern Ukraine a year ago. All 298 people on board were killed. A Dutch-led investigation team has been working to try to determine who was responsible. Russian-backed rebels have been widely blamed for the attack, something Moscow denies. Tom Burridge has more. In their village church, the people that witnessed the horror of the aftermath paid their respects to the innocent men, women and children on board, who were strangers to this community, which, a year on, is still trying to reconcile what happened. This video gives a sense of the carnage and chaos, just after the passenger plane was brought down. On that day, this woman heard the explosion, and saw parts of the plane drop out of the sky. But when she rushed home, she discovered that a woman’s body had fallen through her roof. Today, they honoured the dead. But finding out who was responsible for killing 298 innocent people in a war zone is a hugely complicated task. Away from the genuine sense of grief here, there is a poisonous climate of mistruth and propaganda in this region, linked to the ongoing conflict. So, even when the Dutch-led international investigation team decides what and who brought the plane down, the next hurdle is finding justice for those who died. 20-year-old Ben Pocock from near Bristol was on board the plane. His fatherjeremy says the British Government must continue to fight forjustice for all of the victims who died. We mustn’t lose sight of the fact that there were 80 children on that plane, including many babies. Whole families were wiped out, and there were numerous young adults, including Ben, who had reallyjust started their adult lives. And in the blink of an eye, he was gone. Today, the pro-Russian rebels in charge of this area made sure that lots of their flags were flying at an event of remembrance by the main crash site. This was an international tragedy. But Russia and the West back different sides in this region’s war, and they are unlikely to agree on who killed those on-board flight MH17, and how to implementjustice. New guidelines suggest we should drastically reduce the amount of sugar we eat. A committee of scientists appointed by the government says we should halve our intake of sugars that are either added to food or occur naturally. The head of NHS England has called on leading food retailers to raise prices of sugary drinks. Our Health Editor Hugh Pym reports. Sugar used to be a big deal in this family. Every night with our evening meal we had a lemonade on the table. We definitely cut back on that, we have it once a week now. Holly Taylor realised they were all consuming far too much sugar. She went on a nutrition course to find out what they should be eating and drinking instead. She has worked hard to make sure they have a healthy diet, cutting right back on sugar. What the new guidelines mean is you will not be able to have many snacks and fruits like this in a day before going over the recommended sugar limit. That means big challenges for all of us trying to work out what should be on the menu. We asked one of the experts involved in today’s report to design a sample meal plan with added sugar kept to a minimum. Breakfast was a banana and wheat biscuits, lunch a wholemeal roll, and for dinner, bean curry with a treat of chocolate mousse. She admits it will not be easy for everyone. It will require a cultural change in how we eat. These meals are doable, but they need planning, they need people to shop, to prepare, to cook the meals, to prepare foods they take with them to work or school. It is different to what we are doing at the moment. How responsible are those who sell sugary food and drink? Today the head of NHS England called on leading retailers to raise prices of these products to persuade consumers. If they reflect the cost of that, the prices they choose to charge, this could be a win-win. It will take pounds off the waistline of our children and pounds in the pockets of the income of low-paid employees. But some said it was an abuse of his position. Low sugar choices, they said, are widely available. With ministers set to launch a major obesity strategy in the autumn, the role of companies, consumers and the government will be debated. The politics of sugar are getting more bitter. More new stunning images of Pluto have been unveiled by the US Space Agency. They were captured by the New Horizons probe, which earlier this week made history by flying past this distant world. Our science correspondent Rebecca Morelle has been following the developments. Flying over Pluto’s icy plains. This is the latest image back from the New Horizons spacecraft. Apart from some troughs and hills, the surface is smooth and young. It hints that Pluto is still geologically active, something scientists thought a cold and distant world like this could never be. We have downloaded a lot of data. We have some big news and we will have some more big news next Friday when we have downloaded even more. I will have to tell you, I am a little bit biased, but I think the solar system has saved the best for last. These images have been such a long time coming. New Horizons set off 9.5 years ago and had to travel nearly 5 billion miles to the outer edge of the solar system. But the wait was worth it. For the first time, Pluto’s image has been revealed. Its pixelated moon so tiny. It is dwarfed by Pluto’s largest moon. Scientists are baffled by its mysterious dark spot, which they have nicknamed Mordor. Images of Pluto and science data will be sent to Earth for the next 16 months. Scientists say what we are seeing now is just the tip of the iceberg. Around the world Muslims are celebrating Eid al-Fitr, the festival that marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan. After weeks of fasting between dawn and dusk it is a chance to celebrate. A sea of devotion. Hundreds of thousands of people performing the Eid prayer at the Grand Mosque in Mecca. Among them, the Saudi King. An extraordinary spectacle on a truly epic scale. It is all a little bit more low-key in Gaza, but amongst the rubble of buildings, the children are making the best of things. TRANSLATION: There are many districts where we live that are completely destroyed, so I want to shout out to the whole world that Palestinian children want to celebrate the festival of Eid in peace. In northern Iraq, thousands of people have fled their homes because of the battle against the so-called Islamic State, but even here, there are sweets, and presents, and smiles. Outside this mosque in Manhattan, more prayers, more devotion. But in what are tense times for many Muslims in the United States, there is a message as well. Some American people need to know the difference between terrorism and good Muslims. We are good Muslims. We will fight for America, we are here for America, because America has been good to us. And when we say God bless America, we mean it. The festival will continue over the weekend, Muslims around the world taking a moment to reflect, and to celebrate. ~ Hello, and welcome to the weekend.

Keep checking the forecast. The latest headlines from BBC News. I’m Ben Bland. Fast-moving wildfires have swept across a motorway in California, setting several cars alight and drivers to flee. Desert winds fanned the flames on the mountain pass, 55 miles north of Los Angeles. Parts of the road have been closed to traffic, and helicopters are dropping water over the area. The FBI says the shooter who killed four marines at two military installations in Tennessee was carrying at least three guns. US security services have described the shooting in Chattanooga as ""an act of terrorism"". 21+-four-year old Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez was killed by police. The French Formula 1 driver jules Bianchi has died from injuries sustained during last year’sjapanese Grand Prix. The 25-year-old had been in a coma since an accident last October, when he collided with a crane being used to pick up another crashed car. Thousands more pensioners will have to pay for their care after the Government decided to delay one of its flagship election promises. Ministers were due to bring in a £72,000 cap on the amount older people are required to pay for their care before the state pays the rest. But the plans, designed to prevent pensioners from having to sell their homes, have been put on hold until 2020. jack is 80 and he has Alzheimer’s. His son looked after him for years, but now he needs the support provided by a care home. jack’s own house had to be sold to pay the costs. The cap on care costs was supposed to help people like jack, who along with his wife worked hard to build up savings which are now being drained. The family say the delay leaves him on his own. He had his own property, he had his own private pensions. Whatever you earn, that is now gone. At the moment, one person in ten aged 65 and over will pay more than £100,000 for care. The reforms when they eventually come in will limit that amounts to £72,000. It is estimated one in every eight people needing care would benefit. Ministers say it is not the right time to introduce the cap, even though it was a Conservative manifesto pledge. It is more important to get something right than to stick to one particular date. Although I recognise it was in the manifesto, this is still the right thing to do. Social care provides older and vulnerable people with vital help with day to day tasks. But councils have been warning for some time that increasing demand from an ageing population and the financial costs mean there are facing problems. Charities accept the delay in the cap, because the fundamental problems have to be fixed first. It is a reflection of how desperate the situation at the social care level is. Everybody is worried the system could fall over. For families like these, care is vital. Councils hope they will be able to keep money earmarked for the cap to ease the problems they face. Now on BBC News, The Travel Show. It is so exciting to be surrounded by a family of killer whales, but they are really difficult to film! Hello, and welcome to the Travel Show. This week, I am in Taiwan. Now, most people who head here will come to Taipei, a bustling metropolitan city. But in a moment we will be getting out of the capital and travelling to the east of the island, to sample a new kind of working holiday that is proving to be a stress relief for burnt-out business people. I never think of anyjob issues when I am painting. Maybe because I am so tired! But first, here is what else is coming up in this week’s programme: Our Global Guru helps one traveller plot a breathtaking journey through Central America. And we are in China, as Ben Zand sets out on an adventure across the mainland, using only a smartphone as his guide. Where are you? I am on a path near the mountain. Let’s start this week in Taiwan. The capital Taipei is home to what was once the world’s tallest building, Taipei 101. And you will find plenty of stressed office workers here, all dreaming of the next holiday away from it all. But I have come here tojoin a group of people who have decided that giving something back can be a great way to unwind. And the first part of myjourney involves a two-hour ride on a bullet train, leaving the capital behind and heading east to a county overlooking the Pacific Ocean. It is home to a tribe known locally, and appropriately, given the weather here, as Sons of the Sun. But I am not here to soak up the raysjust yet. I have got some work to do. OK, so the deal is, in exchange for a cut-price cultural holiday, I have got to do a bit of work around the village. And I am heading for my first task. I am told that this will come in handy. A couple of years ago, the villagers here came up with the idea of offering cut-price holidays to outsiders in return for help in keeping the community alive. As many young people have left the town looking for work, the old inhabitants are finding it hard to keep up with DIY and other chores. That is where the holiday- makers who offer a helping hand come to the rescue. Each summer, the locals now open their doors to tourists looking for a working holiday, in return for a slice of life with these people. Hi, you are going to show me how to paint the wall? Sure. The wall looks like it has already been painted. Normally it is about three or four layers, because of the sprays near the ocean. We need to repaint it again and again. TRANSLATION: There were not a lot of employment opportunities here. When it comes to creating jobs in this area, tourism has become really big. I think people find this type of working holiday appealing, it gives them something different to do and helps brighten up the village. It also creates jobs. Two or three colours. The orange colour for. .. He is one of 60 volunteers who has four days to help paint houses. He says that this type of break makes a welcome change from his life back in Taipei. You have seen how people live here. How different is it from the way of your life in Taipei? We work a lot. Here it is more like the countryside, so they are very relaxed, very nice people. But we don’t have that kind of relaxed life, you know, in Taipei. The time we have is only at weekends. So to my next job, and I’m told my lift has arrived. Believe it or not, this is how the locals get around. The distinctive orange paint is a common theme here in the village. But my next job calls for me to get a bit more creative with it. I am off to meetjessica, a logistics worker from Taipei. Herjob this morning is to recycle old fishing buoys, and add more colour to the village. So, is this like stress relief for you? Yes, it is. I never think of anyjob issues when I am painting. Maybe because I am so tired! On average, the volunteers pay around 200 US dollars, that is around £120 for the four-day stay. That covers all food and accommodation. Of course, working holidays are not new. The organisers of this scheme are careful to limit the numbers of people they sign up. And so far, the locals here seem happy. TRANSLATION: It is a tug-of-war between trying to preserve our culture and also attracting more business. So we only run this programme twice a yearforfour days, and we only allow between 1+0 to 60 people to take part at one time. That way we think we keep the balance just right. But it is not all work and no play, as I find out very early the following morning. It is really early! It isjust before 1+am. But I’m told this will be worth it. Fishing is the lifeblood of the people here. Their fortunes are tied to the sea, and today we are hoping to catch a glimpse of something rather special. So we are actually on a whale-watching boat. But our guide says we are unlikely to see some whales, but we will probably see some dolphins. And a spectacular sunrise. This part of the world lies on the Tropic of Cancer, the imaginary ring which circumnavigates the world, and denotes the line of latitude where the sun shines highest in the sky for the longest. Hundreds of thousands of people come to Taiwan every year to take part in events that mark the summer solstice injune. At around 5:30am, I get to see why. So we have been watching the sky change from a pale pink in the very early morning, and it is gradually getting brighter and brighter and more orange. Now we have got this glaze of sun here, which is making such a spectacular view. It is almost like a different shade of orange every minute. Fairly soon after the sunrise, we get our first glimpse of what we have really come to see, killer whales. Whales are a protected species here in Taiwan, and to see them this close is truly breathtaking. And a special reward for me and all the hard-working volunteers. It is so exciting to be surrounded by a family of killer whales. Apparently it is the first sighting of the season. But they are really difficult film, because as soon as they come up, they go down again. This type of working holiday isn’t for everyone. For a start, it is not the most relaxing break. The days are long, and you will need plenty of stamina. You will also be sharing accommodation, which can sometimes be quite basic. But if you want to give something back while leaving your everyday worries at home, maybe this kind of break could be just what you’re looking for. Well, if you’d like to have a go at a working holiday, here is the Travel Show guide of things you might want to think about before you book. If you want to get involved in a meaningful cause and gain skills at the same time, there are hundreds of volunteering projects on offer, ranging from lion conservation to working in schools. You should however consider the ethics attached to the projects. Some have been criticised recently for causing more harm than help. And few organisations offer a breakdown of where their money actually goes. If you are looking for a summerjob that actually pays as well as allows you to go abroad, then theme parks could be a good option. You have to work hard, but you will get lots of interactions with customers, and should hopefully meet like-minded people. Before choosing where to go, it is essential to find out which countries you are eligible to work in, and what the criteria is, as this does vary significantly. And it may depend on your country of origin. Time now for your travel update. Tourism officials injordan are celebrating after UNESCO declared that a site on the eastern bank of the Riverjordan is believed to be the place where jesus was baptised. Traditionally, a site on the western Israeli side of the river is also claimed to be the location. Every year, tens of thousands of Christians travel to the river to be baptised. Many experts have said that there is no archaeological evidence to support the claim. In the UK this week, the country’s busiest airport, Heathrow, was forced to cancel a number of flights and close its main runway for almost three hours. The shutdown came after a number of protesters against airport expansion broke the perimeter fence. And finally, four cheetahs have been treated birthday cake for breakfast at San Diego Zoo this week. The cubs celebrated their first birthday by tucking into the cakes, which were made from ground beef and frozen blood. Still to come on the Travel Show: Planning a trip across the Rocky Mountains? Our Global Guru has advice on the best routes. English? No, no English? Do you speak English? No? Ben Zand faces the first of many challenges, as he kicks off his epicjourney across China. Welcome to the slice of the show that tackles your questions about getting the best out of travel. We are off to Turkey and Canada shortly. But first, plenty of people have got in touch about Fiumicino Airport in Rome. Following a devastating fire there in Terminal Three in May, airlines have been allowed fewer slots at the Italian capital’s main airport. Some flights are being diverted to Rome’s second airport, Ciampino, and others to Naples. Airlines are offering flexibility to switch flights, but are stopping short of paying for ground transportation, and are not obliged to pay compensation. Now, I know from experience how distressing it is to fly to a new country and then to be refused entry because of a bureaucratic snarl up. Linda Smith had that experience when she flew from Singapore to the Chinese capital. I planned to be in Beijing for less than 72 hours, and was led to believe that I wouldn’t need a visa. Unfortunately, on arrival at Beijing Airport, I was turned away. Seemingly because I was flying back to Singapore, rather than onto a different country. Linda, thank you for getting in touch. Sorry to hear about your experience. It appears that you have been badly advised. China has recently relaxed the red tape for short visits to Beijing, Shanghai, and six other cities. Travellers from many countries are now allowed to stay up to 72 hours without visas, so long as they are in transit to a third country. In other words, going from A to B to C. Sadly, anyone flying from A to B and back to A doesn’t qualify, and is expected to apply for a visa in the usual way. So I suggest you have a robust conversation with your travel agent. Next, Fraser Murdoch from Glasgow in Scotland is one of millions of tourists heading for Turkey this summer. When you arrive, because you are sure to get a better rate. This year, the Turkish lira has been having a torrid time. In the first six months of 2015, it lost about 30% of its value against the US dollar and the British pound, and around 10% against the euro. With high inflation prevailing in Turkey, the slump is likely to continue. So rates are going to improve in your favour every day that you wait. Once in, you will find that the price of lira is very competitive. Finally, Alison has a simple question about Canada’s premier train line. This heritage train has a range of itineraries between British Columbia and Alberta, taking you through the Rocky Mountains and some spectacular lines, notably in Vancouver. Because it is a tourist train, journeys are timed to take place entirely in daylight, unlike the Canadian schedule TransCanada service, which is much more rewarding going east to west. just choose the direction of travel versus the rest of your plans. But I hope I can persuade you to add a coastal rail experience that is, in my book, one of the best train trips in all of North America: The Cascade train, which clings to the Pacific shore between Vancouver and Seattle. We have reached the end of the line for now. But remember that Global Guru is the element of the Travel Show that aims to help with every aspect of your journey. Whether you are cruising the ocean or planning for Christmas, just e-mail the Travel Show and I will do my very best to find you the answer. Bye for now, and see you next time. Next up, we are off to China, a vast country which, despite being well established on the tourist trail, is still a daunting prospect for many travellers. We sent Ben Zand on an adventure with an unusual tour guide - his smartphone. And the task of using travel apps and social media to get around the country. He begins hisjourney in Hong Kong. just a few miles from mainland China, but another world in terms of Internet freedom. To find out what challenges await, he kicks off in the busy shopping district. OK, so this is pretty much one of the loudest, brightest and busiest places I have ever been in my life. I am on my way right now to meet a man who is going to explain to me how all of this is going to work when I get to mainland China. That man is a guru in modern Chinese communication. It is a different universe, OK, in Hong Kong, compared to mainland China. It is because of the Great Firewall of China. The Great Firewall is basically how the Chinese government controls what information citizens can access on the Internet. Twitter, Facebook, and even Google are generally inaccessible on the mainland. So they will not be of much help when trying to get around. To try to experience the Great Firewall of China, it is definitely a punishing process in the beginning, but once you get used to it, there is some strange fun, when you are no longer disappointed by what you cannot access. You get surprised by the new things, and you have fun. So I have pretty much accepted things are going to get a lot more difficult once I leave Hong Kong. But luckily I have figured out where I’m going to go next. And that is this place, a national park. I have found an app that allows me to explore this park, and, even though it is virtual, it still looks incredible. So I’m going to see what it looks like in real life. The park is 500 miles to the north, in Hunan Province. But with no direct flights, I have flown into this city. English? No? No English? Do you speak English? No, no English. I have arrived at the train station, slightly nervous. I don’t know about Chinese trains. So I will see how it goes. Ahead of me is the joy of a six-hour night train. OK, the good news is I have managed to make it onto the train. The bad news is, it turns out jack was right. Twitter doesn’t work, Facebook doesn’t work, even YouTube doesn’t work. This has made me move to Chinese social media, as I was expecting. For now though, it is bedtime. Goodnight. The next day, and I have made it to the National Forest Park. But it seems like a lot of other people have had the exact same idea. It turns out it is not quite the tranquil getaway the app originally suggested. It is actually the complete opposite, and it is completely rammed with domestic tourists. But when you take the trip to the top, it is easy to see why they come. So I want to go to a few of the quieter, more hidden places. And to do that I’m going to use WeChat, which is kind of like an amalgamation of Facebook and WhatsApp, to find myself an English tour guide. WeChat is huge here. There are many monthly users. As well as being used for messaging, it is full of local companies and services. It does use mobile data, so I have bought a local Sim card for the job. A few messages later, and I have managed to track down an English-speaking tour guide called Nicky. Hi! Hello. Nice to meet you, how are you doing? Where are you? I am on a path near the mountain. just stay there, and I will come to find you. OK. Our first stop is the one-kilometre-tall mountain. This was actually the inspiration for the floating mountains in the highest grossing film of all time, Avatar. So Avatar gave you a job, in a way? Yes! And we will go to a more beautiful place... I found Nicky to help me escape the crowds, so after a few sneaky short cuts and some lesser- known paths, we finally found ourselves with a bit of peace and quiet. If you come here by yourself, it is just lots of rocks. But if you have a guide, this looks like a mountain, this looks like a fairy, it is interesting. It has been a successful first day in mainland China. It would have been all too easy to get lost in the huge crowds here, but thanks to the power of social media and an English-speaking guide, I have found a tranquil corner to enjoy the landscape. That’s all we’ve got time for in this edition of the programme. Don’t forget, if you would like to follow the rest of the Travel Show team wherever they are in the world on theirjourneys in real time, you can sign up to our social media feeds. The details on your screen now. Coming up next week: Ben Zand continues hisjourney across China, and tries to get to grips with translation apps, with varying degrees of success. Let’s go for an easy one, toilet. Here we have toilet. Beef ears! It is pretty luxurious, and spacious as well. And Ade is in Spain’s Costa Blanca, checking out the holiday home market, and asking if it could be a good time to buy there again. join us for that if you can. In the meantime, from me and the rest of the Travel Show team here in Taiwan, it is goodbye. Hello, and welcome to the weekend. Some rain, some wind, but most of us will get at least one fine day out of it. Here is the big picture then for Saturday morning. Low pressure to the north of Scotland, after a windy night. Still strong, gusty winds here to start the day. Still some wet weather around. Fine start elsewhere, weather fronts though waiting to come in to change things for part two of the weekend, on Sunday, as I will show you in a moment. This is how it looks, though, for the first part of Saturday morning. Notice the wind arrows in Scotland, still very gusty winds here. Lighter winds elsewhere, and as you can see, plenty of sunshine across southern England to begin the day. Should be plenty of bright, blue sky. A fresh start, temperatures gradually heading up, and it will feel warm in that sunshine by the afternoon. Bit of patchy cloud around for Wales, northern England, Northern Ireland, quite windy, especially to the north. But the strongest, most gusty winds will be across Scotland. So a really blowy start. Cloud and outbreaks of rain are still most persistent towards the west. Now, as that low pressure for northern Scotland begins to pull away, it takes its rain with it gradually during the day. Still some wet weather though into parts of Highland into the afternoon. Only slowly the wind easing, but it is still windy into the afternoon. Breezy elsewhere, a few showers pop up, parts of Northern Ireland, maybe north Wales, northern England. Fairly hit and miss, but a cloudier spell to come for those of you. Plenty of sunshine though across southern parts of Wales and England. This will see the warmest weather. Now, what does all of that mean for the golf at St Andrews? Could be some rain around first thing. It looks dryer as the day goes on, gets brighter too, but it is windy. Very gusty winds, that is the main challenge for the golfers. It will be late in the day before things start to improve. Those hoping for rain for the cricket won’t get any for Saturday. On Sunday, though, if there is still some play to be had, it is a different story, because as we go through Saturday night and into Sunday, those weather fronts start to come in. This is a picture on Saturday evening. Eventually, as you can see, we will see more persistent, heavier rain coming into Northern Ireland. And as we go on through the rest of the night, then, more of us are going to see increasing cloud, and eventually these weather fronts move through, we get some outbreaks of rain. But do not write Sunday off at this stage. Whilst there is still a lot of uncertainty about the detail, it looks as if early rain does start to pull away, and actually, for many of us, things begin to improve. That is particularly the case on Sunday, we think, across the northern half of the UK. You start to see some sunny spells, still a few showers in Scotland. We keep a lot of cloud, though, to the south, and we could well see some further outbreaks of rain coming back in from the south-west later in the day. But, got plans on Sunday? Keep checking the forecast. ~ Hello, this is Breakfast, with Charlie Stayt and Steph McGovern. The Sun publishes footage of the Queen performing a Nazi salute as a child.

191,BBC1 London,18-jul-2015,BBC News,18:45,10 mins,True,"There. Being a parent can be a real challenge. The risks are high. But the rewards are priceless. That looks REALLY scary. Good evening. Buckingham Palace says it’s disappointed at the publication of images, from 1933, showing the Queen, as a young girl, giving a Nazi salute. The home movie was obtained by the Sun newspaper. It depicts the Queen at Balmoral- making the gesture with the Queen Mother- and the then Prince of Wales, later Edward VIII. Here’s our Royal Correspondent Nicholas Witchell. Seen through modern eyes, the images are undeniably startling. Princess Elizabeth playing in the gardens of Balmoral and giving a Nazi salute. As did her mother who was later to be Britain’s wartime Queen and on the right of the picture, Elizabeth’s uncle, the future King Edward VIII. The Sun will not say how it obtained the footage, which is supposed to have been taken by the Queen’s father in 1933 when she would have been seven years old. Buckingham Palace released a short statement in which it said, it is disappointing that film, shot eight decades ago and apparently from Her Majesty’s personal family archive has been obtained and exploited in this manner. The royal biographer Hugo Vickers said the way in which the images had been presented had created a misleading impression. What I think is shocking is that somebody has spotted this particular footage and, seen in the round, it is all pretty harmless stuff. It is also private, it is also not meant for public consumption. And that they have sought to highlight it and to freeze the frame at a moment when it all looks very, sort of, nasty and political. To understand the context of the images, we need to understand Europe in the mid 1930s. Germany had elected the Nazi Adolf Hitler as its leader, the Nazi salute was not then seen as especially abhorent. This was the centre of London in 1936, the Nazi salute was given as the coffin of the German ambassador was borne by British guardsmen. Yet for the Royal family, there are unwelcome echoes in these images. They centre on the man who was briefly King Edward VIII and who, after his abdication in 1936, went to Germany to meet Hitler. This is a matter of national significance, presented in the proper way. I’m not sure the issue of privacy is a keynote one when you’re talking about the conduct of the Royal Family, not least Edward VIII, who went on to be King before abdicating and then before becoming a Nazi sympathiser. I think the historical significance is relatively clear. The palace will not say how the Queen has reacted to today’s publication, they simply say that the record of her service and that of her family, throughout the Second World War and through to the present day speaks for itself. Disappointment and I sensed dismay at the palace that these images have entered the public domain, not least because they rekindle questions about the Duke of Windsor’s attitude to the Nazis. They are confident that people will see them in context. She was seven years old, messing around in her garden, not understanding the connotations of that salute at a time when those connotations did not have the poor and associations that came later. The palace is hoping that fair-minded people will feel that these images in relation to the Queen had no real significance. The family of a 79-year-old driver murdered after a crash in West Sussex have paid tribute to him, describing him as the perfect role model. Don Lock, a retired solicitor, was stabbed repeatedly on Thursday night in Findon, near Worthing, in an apparent road rage incident. Today a knife was recovered, a 34 year old man remains in custody. Mark Sanders has the details. Don Lock’s life touch many others. A 79-year-old who was expecting his sixth great grandchild. Today his family paid tribute to a man much loved and admired by those who knew him. Full of wisdom, full of wet, always calm. Always supportive, the perfect role model and full of charm. We will be working hard to support my mother through the unavailable process which will follow as a result of the circumstances which will only delay the chance for us to move on and just remember my father for the fantastic person he was. The family thanked all of the people who tried to save Don Lock after he was repeatedly stabbed on Thursday night. It happened after a suspected road rage incident when he was involved in a minor car accident. Sussex Police say the attack on the 79-year-old was violent and unprovoked. Sussex Police have confirmed they have recovered a knife and a car as part of their investigation. 83lI-year-old man remains in custody and detectives have been granted more time question him. Tonight, people are continuing to leave flowers at the side of the road where it Don Lock was killed. Mark Sanders, BBC News, Findon. Search teams have been combing through the smouldering ruins of a wood mill at Bosley near Macclesfield which was destroyed by a fire and a series of explosions yesterday morning. Three men and a woman who are believed to have been inside the four-storey building are unaccounted for. Let’s go to our correspondent judith Moritz, who’s in Bosley for us now. Yes andI Yes and I am standing here speaking to you from outside the urgency chord in which still in circles the complex, keeping people away, but this morning for a short time I was allowed inside the restricted zone and was able to see the devastated mill buildings up close. Somewhere beneath this wreckage it is still had that for people may live. Brick by Brick the rubble has been pulled apart, rescuers refusing to give up hope. It is hard going, the ruins are still smouldering at the midst the mangled masonry, so huge was the impact of the blast. There was 5000 litres of kerosene that had leaked out, it was on fire. Whilst the initial blast had gone and it was a fireball and that had gone and left the fire in the building, there was a running fuel fire here, there were cylinders identified on the site which could explode at any moment. Temperatures soared to 1000 Celsius as the fuel set light to silos full of sawdust. More than one day since the explosions and firefighters are still working to extinguish pockets of fires around the mill complex. They have also been joined of fires around the mill complex. They have also beenjoined by specialist search teams who are combing through the wreckage, piece by piece. Some of these teams are used to working in earthquakes and today in the search for those missing, they have been using the same equipment and techniques. The process is slow and steady really. We will remove debris selectively from certain parts of the pile and we will search again, we will photograph and we will keep moving the pile, keep moving the debris until we locate someone. In this small rural village the wait for news is agony. These people are desperate to know what has happened to the friend, Dorothy Bailey, who has been named locally as one of the four missing workers.

After the first bout of shooting, we came running out and went in that direction. It is the first time john has been back. So loud you could not tell where the shooting was coming from, so Ijust stopped, fell on my back, turned around and came running back to go back inside. And as he hid, commandos stalked the heavily armed Islamist fighters in what would end up being a four-day siege. By the time it was all over, 67 people lay dead. Do you find your behaviour changing now in the light of your experience when you are in crowded spaces in Kenya? Yeah. Obviously, when I see security, I feel a little safer. But it does not stop me from looking for an escape route, just in case. Rachel is not going back. The militants’ grenade exploded right on her foot, making her wary of returning to Westgate, but she has this message for Al-Shabaab. For me, I forgive them and one day, one time there shall be judgment. Security has been enhanced, but there are still many unanswered questions. The exact identities of the gunmen is still unclear and how were they able to sustain an attack here on this vast shopping centre for so long? There have been other attacks since which have claimed hundreds of lives, which means Kenya remains deeply entrenched in the global war on terror. Across Kenya, security is being stepped up, with US President Obama due to visit the country next week, the threat of a further Al-Shabaab attack is greater than ever. Kenya, already crippled by falling visitor numbers, knows the world is watching. Now all the sport from the BBC sport centre. We’ll start with cricket and England face a near-impossible task to save the second Ashes Test at Lord’s. After bowling the hosts out on Day three, Australia pressed home their advantage with the bat and at the close of play led by 362 runs. joe Wilson reports. Australia on Saturday morning, we are miles ahead, boys, nothing can stop us now, nothing. just be careful of that! Being on the front foot means different things in different ways in cricket. Ben Stokes got past 50 with this shot. He made 87. Mitchell March’s first Ashes wicket. Now, jos Buttler batting on 13, good catch. He did not wait for the umpire. He decided for him, turned around and walked off, the reflection of another era. In Test match cricket, the fundamentals still apply. Concentration still means everything. And no one does it better than England’s skipper. Out for 96, gutted and England were soon all out, 254 behind. Cook was leading his team in the field again. Australia’s second innings, Warner dropped on nought. Australia were 108 for the close and England were desperate for anything to change the mood. Only a spectator managed it. Transmitted on the big screen. By Saturday night, if you weren’t laughing at the cricket, you’d be crying. The Murray brothers, Andy and jamie, have given Great Britain a 2-1 lead in their Davis Cup quarter-final tie with France, after a thrilling victory in their doubles rubber. Roared on by the home crowd at Queen’s Club, the pair beat jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Nicolas Mahut over four sets. A win in the final round of singles matches tomorrow would see Great Britain into the semi-finals for the first time in 34 years. The governing body of Formula One, the FIA, says the world of motor sport is in mourning following the death ofjules Bianchi. The 25-year-old French driver died last night, nine months after suffering severe head injuries in a crash at the 2014 japanese Grand Prix. His Manor Marussia team described him as a shining talent who was destined for great things. Severe weather delays have forced golf’s Open Championship to conclude on Monday, for only the second time in the competition’s155-year history. A flooded course and 40mph winds allowed for only brief periods of play today at St Andrew’s, where America’s Dustin johnson holds the overnight lead. Karthi Gnanesegaram reports. They started and then stopped after just 32 minutes. Strong winds suspended play as Tiger Woods score card escaped, and jordan Spieth expressed the sentiments of many. We should never even have started. After a ten-and-a-half hour delay the golfers finally got on the course. But they also know they’ll definitely still be playing on Monday for only second time in the tournament’s history. America’s Dustinjohnson dropped a shot in the early morning wind but gained one in his early evening finish to lead the field by one stroke on 10-under par. Almost as dramatic as the weather, was a hole in one at the 11th for England’s Daniel Brooks, the first in an Open at St Andrews for 25 years. But Woods’ luck has been lacking. He has missed the cut and heads home at the halfway stage. Britain’s Chris Froome claims he had urine thrown at him during Stage 14 of the Tour de France, following accusations that he is doping. The 2013 champion, who insists he’s a clean rider, retained the yellow jersey today, extending his overall lead to more than three minutes. The stage was won by another Briton, Steve Cummings - the first of his career. Great Britain have added another four medals to their tally at the IPC Swimming World Championships in Glasgow.

Gusty winds, as well to go with it around Irish sea coasts but winds lighter across Scotland compared with today. Most of us seeing rain to the first part of tomorrow morning but it quickly gets out of the way. A few splashes of rain into the south-east by 9.00am leaving a better day across southern areas than 24 hours ago. A mild enough start across the country, 14-16C across many southern areas. Showers still in Wales and the Midlands and the north-east of England. North-west Wales already brightening up. It will be doing the same across western Scotland and Northern Ireland, although a few showers are possible during the first part of the day. Different story to central and eastern Scotland, we don’t need the rain here at the moment, certainly not at St Andrews, it will be a wet morning. The rain easing off but compared with today the winds are much lighter. It will be an onshore breeze keeping things cool. Gusty winds across parts of Northern Ireland and northern parts of England but it helps to push the rain away to leave most dry in the afternoon. A few showers in Scotland. In the sunshine feeling warm especially to the south-east. It’s looking dry at Lord’s. Rain to the south-west later on bringing cloudy conditions for Monday. A few showers.

Ghanaian midfielder Emmanuel Frimpong has called the Russian Football Union ""beyond a joke"" after he was handed a two—game ban for reacting to alleged racist abuse. The former Arsenal midfielder said he was the subject of monkey chants before being sent off for a gesture playing for club side Ufa against Spartak Moscow. Spartak will not be punished, as the RFU said it found no evidence of racism. Frimpong tweeted: ""For the Russian FA to say they didn’t hear or see any evidence of racism is beyond a joke."" Earlier this week, Zenit St Petersburg’s Brazilian striker Hulk claimed racism happened at ""almost every game"" in the Russian league. Barcelona have been breaking records again, this time thanks to 92,226 fans, most of them in blue and scarlet. A new crowd record at the Pasadena Rose Bowl as Barca beat the LA Galaxy 2—1. A couple of old pals from their Liverpool days, Steven Gerrard now with the Galaxy, and Barcelona’s Luis Suarez, happy to see each other again. On the field it was the Uruguyan who drew first blood, opening the scoring for the Catalans just before the break. Suarez was among seven Barca players taken off for a rest at half time, but Roberto doubled the European Champion’s lead after 55 minutes. But at least the home fans had something to cheer about when Tommy Meyer powered in a header at the death. 2—1 the final score. Tour De France leader Chris Froome fended off several attacks in stage 17 from Digne—les—Bains to Pra Loup. American Tejay van Garderen withdrew from cycling’s ultimate race, after starting Wednesday in third place. His BMC team say he was suffering from headaches. Meanwhile, Britain’s Froome successfully countered attacks from nearest rival Nairo Quintana, early and late on, in the ride through the Alps. So the Team Sky Rider maintains his 3 minute lead.

The answer is an emphatic no. Well, not yet, anyway, as you’ll see in our next report. but the 19th RoboCup games have been taking place in Heifei, China.

You can get all the latest sports news at our website — that’s bbc.com/sport. But from me and the rest of the Sport Today team, goodbye. Hello. The forecast for Friday is giving us a few headaches at the moment. Shorter term it is more straightforward. Low pressure to the north of the UK, bringing breezy weather to northern parts. Quiet and settled further south. This low pressure system is the problem for Friday. Just determining how far north it will come. In the shorter term for Thursday a largely dry day for England and Wales. Starting the day with a couple of light showers across the south—west. Sunny spells elsewhere. After a cool start, temperatures getting up into the midteens. Some patchy cloud drifting through. Fairly light breezes. The breeze is more noticeable as you go into Northern Ireland, and northern western counties of England and Scotland, where winds will Some will be heavy. Not many showers in the eastern side of the Grampians. Little change through the rest of the day. Still a scattering of showers for Scotland and Northern Ireland. Showers across England and Wales. Most places stay dry. Light winds, feeling warm in England and Walas. The breeze will provide a cool edge in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Friday is a bit of a problem and it is all down to this low pressure. Uncertainty as to how far north it will come. The best estimate at the moment is that the heaviest rain looks most likely to be across southern parts of England and Wales, but it is possible that the rain could get up to north Wales, Manchester, across much of the Midlands. This is how we see things at the moment. There is uncertainty as we go further north. More certain about the forecast for Scotland and Northern Ireland. Here, a scattering of showers. Relatively light winds. Temperature still below average for the time of year. Then, as the weather system pulls away during Friday evening and Friday night, there are strong winds for a time across East Anglia and the south—east as the heavy rain pulls away, but for most places you end up with a decent day. A few showers in Scotland and England. Elsewhere, light winds and sunshine coming through. Again, temperatures a bit below where you might see them at this time of year. The second half of the weekend turns more settled. Cloud and rain edging in from the west, meaning many eastern areas will have a fine day, before the rain arrives later on. Welcome to Newsday on the BBC. Here are the headlines: Police in the US state of Texas deny editing a video which shows the arrest of a black woman who later died in custody. Is the smog in China clearing? New figures suggest air quality in almost 200 Chinese cities has improved significa ntly. Supporters of dissident Chinese artist Ai Weiwei congratulate him on getting his passport back after more than four years. Four Chelsea football fans who repeatedly pushed a black Frenchman off the Paris Metro have been banned for up to five years. It’s1:OOam here in London. This is Newsday. Police in Texas investigating the death of a black woman in their custody have released a revised version of video footage showing her arrest. They denied that their initial video had been edited, blaming technical glitches forjumps and overlaps. The rase of Sandra Bland is the latest to put a strain on relations between police and African—Americans in the US. The FBI is now investigating and says her death will be reviewed like a murder case. The BBC’s Gary O’Donoghue reports. July 10, a highwayjust outside Houston, Texas, and Sandra Bland is stopped for failing to signal when changing lanes. Hello, ma’am. It starts off relatively calmly. The police officer goes back to his own car. And a few minutes later he returns, and tensions start to rise. You seem very irritated. I am, I really am. And then the real spark, over a cigarette. Do you mind putting out your cigarette, please? I am in my car, I don’t have to put out my cigarette. Well, you can step out now. I don’t have to step out. Step out of the car. No, you do not have the right to do that. I do have the right, new step out or I will remove you. As things get worse, the officer pulls a stun gun and issues a threat. Get out of the car! Get out! 1m You are doing all this for a failure to signal. Get over here. Right, yeah. Let’s take this to court. As the two moved out of the camera’s view, the events escalate further. Aftweards, Sandra Bland is taken to Waller County Jail. Three days later, just after 9:003m on the 13th ofJuly, she was found hanging in her cell. Attempts to resuscitate her were unsuccessful. The death is now being investigated by the local district attorney, and police are facing severe criticism for apparently editing the original dashcam video. Here is one example. You see the driver get out of his cab and walk away, reappearing in the same position a few moments later. The Texas Department for Public Safety says there was a glitch on the video when it was uploaded and have now released a new set of footage. Meanwhile, Sandra Bland’s family says there has to be an independent autopsy to look at how she died, as they do not believe she killed herself. Sandy was pulled over for failure to indicate a proper lane change, and looking at that as her sister, I feel the officer was picking on her. Air pollution levels in China’s cities improved in the first six months of this year, according to the environmental campaign group, Greenpeace. It says average levels of the most harmful air pollutants have fallen significantly in almost 200 cities. But why? Let’s get more now from our correspondent John Sudworth, who’s in Shanghai. What do you make of these figures what do you make of these figures from What do you make of these figures from Greenpeace? What is the reason from Greenpeace? what is the reason for this drop in from Greenpeace? What is the reason for this drop in air pollutants? It for this drop in air pollutants? It is very interesting. For a long is very interesting. For a long time, we have had headlines out of time, we have had headlines out of China using terms like air China using terms like air Apocalypse, air Armageddon, Apocalypse, air Armageddon, suggesting that this country was suggesting that this country was facing such a crisis that there was facing such a crisis that there was little it could do in the short little it could do in the short term, in other words, this was so term, in other words, this was so integral in China’s model of integral in China’s model of economic growth that the Communist economic growth that the Communist Party was caught between a rock and Party was caught between a rock and a hard place. Rising pollution a hard place. Rising pollution levels and rising public concern on levels and rising public concern on the other hand. And yet, here we the other hand. And yet, here we have these figures which looks like have these figures which looks like hard evidence that things are hard evidence that things are beginning to improve. However, we beginning to improve. However, we should mention that from a very high should mention that from a very high and serious pollution problem this and serious pollution problem this does not suggest that the air is yet does not suggest that the air is yet breathable, but it is coming down breathable, but it is coming down and Greenpeace insists that it is in and Greenpeace insists that it is in large part because of government large part because of government enforcement. They are getting better enforcement. They are getting better and implemented some of the and implemented some of the punishments that are available to punishments that are available to them for some of the worst case them for some of the worst rase polluters. them for some of the worst case polluters. They say this is a sign polluters. They say this is a sign of political will. With these of political will. With these quantities of pollutants, they are quantities of pollutants, they are often talking about minute and often talking about minute and invisible fragments. Looking at the invisibla fragments. Looking at the pictures invisible fragments. Looking at the pictures behind you, the air does pictures behind you, the air does not look particularly clear. Is not look particularty dear. Is there any not look particularly clear. Is there any perceptible difference or there any perceptible difference or improvement as you go around the improvement as you go around the country? Well...

But as I was saying earlier, I think But as I was saying eartier, I think that the But as I was saying earlier, I think that the main thing here is that that the main thing here is that this is a relative improvement. this is a relative improvement. China’s pollution levels even after China’s pollution levels even after this 16% decrease in the most this 16% decrease in the most harmless pollutants, the level of harmless pollutants, the level of those pollutants on average across those pollutants on average across the country is still something like the country is still something like seven times the World Health seven times the World Health Organisation suggested maximum. 50, Organisation suggested maximum. So, this is an Organisation suggested maximum. 50, this is an improvement and it is this is an improvement and it is significant but there is no doubt significant but there is no doubt about it that China has a long way about it that China has a long way to go. Thank you. The Greek Parliament is debating another round of economic reforms, which it is required to pass for talks to start on a new 86 billion euro bailout. The measures include the adoption of an EU directive to bolster banks and protect savers’ deposits. Earlier, the European Central Bank increased its financial lifeline to Greek banks by 900 million euros. The White House says plans to close the controversial US prison camp at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba are in the final stages. President Obama pledged to close the facility on the day he took office in 2009, but has faced obstacles in doing so. 122 men accused of being enemy combatants from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq remain in detention. A joint operation between the Colombian military and the Farc rebel group has restarted to remove some of the thousands of mine s placed by the rebels during more than half a century of conflict. The project was stopped a week ago after a soldier was killed.

US officials have given oil giant Royal Dutch Shell approval to begin exploratory drilling in the Arctic. The company will only initially be able to drill the top sections of the wells because essential emergency equipment is not yet on site. 15 billion barrels of oil are believed to be under the sea off the north—west coast of Alaska. Now to a treasure which has been hiding in plain sight. what may be the world’s oldest fragments of the Koran have been found here in the UK at the University of Birmingham. They have been carbon dated to the seventh century and British researchers believe the person who wrote them could have met the Prophet Muhammad. Nick Higham reports. It’s just a fragment, but it’s written using an early form of Arabic script and the words are from the Koran. They’re written on sheep or goat skin parchment and that parchment’s been radiocarbon dated to the year 645, at the latest. It could be even older. The Prophet Muhammad died in 632. If the dating of our Koran is correct, then the person who actually wrote it may well have known the Prophet Muhammad. He would have seen him, probably. He would maybe have heard him preach in Medina. He may have known him personally and that really is quite a thought to conjure with. Muslims believe the Koran was dictated by Muhammad and then memorised and written down, unchanged, by his immediate followers, but some Western academics think it must have evolved over many years, like the Christian Bible and theJewish Torah. This discovery is significant because it suggests the traditional Muslim account might in fact be correct, the text may indeed have been settled during the prophet’s own lifetime. For Birmingham’s Muslim community, one of the largest in the country, it’s a remarkable and emotional discovery. Myself, when I saw these pages, I was very much moved. There were tears ofjoy and emotions in my eyes because we never thought that we would have such an old copy of our holy book. I think, as a news story, it’s very good because Muslims are constantly in the headlines for the wrong reasons. The fact that they have some kind of validation for their religious tradition and the history of that tradition is important for themselves, in terms of self identity, and also it gives pride to the Muslim community as well that they have something they can reflect upon and perhaps talk to people about. And it’s in Birmingham thanks to a member of the wealthy Cadbury family in the city, who bankrolled a collector of ancient manuscripts in the 19205. Nick Higham, BBC News. Supporters of Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei have been congratulating him on the return of his passport more than four years after it was confiscated by the authorities. He said he would like his first trip to be to Germany to see his son. Ai was detained for three months in 2011 during a nationwide crackdown. He posted a picture on Instagram showing him with the precious document. Visitors to the page invited him to come and visit Amsterdam or Hawaii. Some bloggers picked up on Ai’s own private protest at the confiscation, when he started placing flowers in a bicycle outside his Beijing studio in 2013. Virtual bouquets of flowers were posted for the Chinese artist by admirers across the world. Four Chelsea football fans have been banned from attending football matches for up to five years for their involvement in a racist incident on the Paris underground. Video footage recorded in February showed a black commuter being repeatedly pushed off a carriage amid racist chanting. Daniela Relph was at the Court in London. Her report contains some flashing images from the start. CHANTING. Paris in February of this year. Chelsea fans in the city ahead of their Champions League game. There had been tension and disorder for much of the day. Police reported heavy drinking and drug taking amongst fans. But it was an incident on the Paris Metro that a judge described today as having tarnished the reputation of English football in Europe. Souleymane Sylla, on his way home from work, tried to get onto a Metro carriage. Chelsea fans blocked his path and pushed him off the train. He tried again, but got the same reaction amid deeply offensive chants. We’re racist, we’re racist... Today, four of those involved were punished. Richard Barklie, 50 years old, a former police officer, now working in human rights, banned for five years for aggressive conduct. Next to him, 20-year-old joshua Parsons, whose behaviour that night was described as agitated and threatening, also banned for five years. Behind him, Jordan Munday. He got a three-year ban for contributing to unacceptable behaviour. And William Simpson — anotherfive year ban. Thejudge warned him he could not hide behind the mob. REPORTER: You’re accused of being a thug. Are you a thug, Mr Simpson? As he left court today, William Simpson was asked about his behaviour that night. He said nothing. The judge told the court that the use of CCTV and phone footage meant unacceptable behaviour was now less easy to hide in the crowd. He said the conduct of the four Chelsea fans that evening in Paris was ""nasty, arrogant and abhorrent, and could not be tolerated in a civilised society."" At home in Paris, Souleymane Sylla says the experience has been hard to forget. TRANSLATION: I’m waiting for compensation, for myself and for my family. We’ve all been so traumatised by this. Thejudge said that despite much good work, football still has a racism problem and this case had highlighted that. Daniela Relph, BBC News, Stratford.

Hello. The forecast for Friday is giving us a few headaches at the moment. Shorter term, it is a little more more straightforward. Low pressure to the north of the UK, bringing breezy weather to northern parts. Quiet and settled further south. This low pressure system is the problem for Friday. Just determining exactly how far north it will come. In the shorter term for Thursday, a largely dry day for much of England and Wales. Starting the day with a couple of light showers across the south—west. But sunny spells elsewhere. After a cool start, temperatures getting up quickly into the midteens. Some patchy cloud drifting through on those fairly light breezes. The breeze is more noticeable as you go into Northern Ireland, and northern most counties of England and Scotland, where winds will be rattling through some showers. Some will be heavy. Not many showers getting across the eastern side of the Grampians. Little change through the rest of the day. Still a scattering of showers for Scotland and Northern Ireland. Showers across England and Wales are few and far between. Most places stay dry. Light winds, feeling warm in England and Walas. The breeze will provide a cool edge to a good part of Scotland and Northern Ireland. Friday is a bit of a problem and it is all down to this low pressure. A lot of uncertainty as to how far north it will come. The best estimate at the moment is that the heaviest rain looks most likely to be across southern parts of England and Wales, but it is possible that the rain could get up to, well, north Wales, Manchester, across much of the Midlands. This is how we see things at the moment. There is uncertainty as we go further north. More certain about the forecast for Scotland and Northern Ireland. Here, a scattering of showers. Relatively light winds. Temperature still below average for the time of year. Mid-to-high teens at best for most areas. Then, as the weather system pulls away during Friday evening and Friday night, there are strong winds for a time, even gales, across East Anglia and the south-east as the heavy rain pulls away, but for most places A few showers in Scotland and England. Elsewhere, should be dry, light winds and sunshine coming through. Again, temperatures a bit below where you might see them at this time of year. The second half of the weekend turns more unsettled. Cloud and rain edging in from the west, meaning many eastern areas will have a fine day, before the rain arrives later on. But still, a bit on the cool side for now. This is BBC World News.

South Korea’s growth slows sharply. Is MERS to blame? And time to celebrate — why corks are popping in India’s wine industry. Welcome to Asia Business Report, live from London. I’m Alice Baxter. We begin in South Korea where an outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, has hit the economy hard. The tourism sector has particularly struggled with visitor numbers plunging more than 40% inJune. And figures out in the last hour suggest the economy grew byjust 0.3% between April and June — less than half as fast as the previous quarter. But as you can see, the economy had actually been slowing down even before the outbreak. Earlier, I asked James Rooney of Market Force Company in Seoul what he made of these figures. First of all, it is less than what First of all, it is lass than what was generally First of all, it is less than what was generally expected. People were talking about a 0.8% tracking rate falling down to 0.4%, so to come in and 0.3% is below expectations. More significantly than that, the MERS outbreak started in May and was really felt inJune, so less than one quarter could really have been affected by it. Even though the service sector is around 50% of the economy and tourism is an important part of driving that sector, the lack of international tourism and the MERS effect themselves cannot fully explain that degree of a drop. There is obviously weakness in the economy more generally. It is obviously an economy under stress. With those numbers, June itself was presumably a negative growth rate. With this lack of international and domestic tourism activity, it is still affecting South Korea this month and we must therefore expect that the next quarter will also be negatively impacted by the weakness in the service sector. I do not expect to see a start of recovery there until September or October when the autumn season occurs and some of the neighbouring countries have big holidays that will benefit Korea, assuming it can attract tourists back to the country. There is not the same degree of traffic on the street. The economy shows signs of weakness out on the street. Even on vacations, South Koreans are talking about staying at home and not going anywhere, and that is not going to help domestic growth because with a heavy dependence on the service sector, you need people to be out of there and spending money. Domestic consumption is very important. In other news, New York City has backed down in a row with taxi—hailing app Uber, dropping plans to limit the number of cars it operates in the city. Instead, Uber has agreed to take part in a study looking at the impact of its cars on traffic and pollution. City officials had earlier voted to call for a 1% cap on the firm’s growth in the city. Brazil’s government has proposed another $2.6 billion of spending cuts as part of an austerity plan to get its economy growing again. The country’s finance minister said the government will not be able to meet this year’s budget surplus target. Until recently, Brazil was seen as an emerging star but its economy is now expected to shrink more than 1% this year. India’s Adani Mining has suspended work on its Carmichael coal mine in Queensland. It blamed the move on delays in government approvals for the project, which environmentalists say could damage the Great Barrier Reef. The project is worth more than $7 billion. Now to Africa, where China is the biggest investor in the continent, with more than $200 billion in circulation. Most companies are involved in mining and infrastructure. But the relationship is notjust about economics and politics. It’s also about people and how they interact. Lerato Mbele reports. Preparing for a new world. At this school, they start young. First graders learn Mandarin as a compulsory part of the curriculum, recognition of China’s growing stature. Initially, the school was established to teach the children of Chinese families but now, the whole situation has changed in the world and we now recognise the critical value in our children learning Mandarin. It is not only the language but Chinese values are also inculcated in the teaching. Further away, outside of (“ape Town lies another testament that China has arrived. Hisense, an electronics company, set up shop here two years ago. In this factory, they produce mainly television sets and refrigerators. television sets and refrigerators. They produce on average three per They produce on average three per minute. Some parts are imported but for the refrigerators, it is a production from the ground up. The coming of Hisense to this area has been important because for the longest time, manufacturing was in serious decline and many of these workers were without a job. Now they are back on the factory floor and acquiring new skills. Over 9096 of the workforce is made up of locals. It is not charity, it is business. More Chinese companies are moving away from their motherland because production costs and wages are going up. With local factories, it makes us more stable and better able to control our costs. The unemployment rate here is more than 555 and we have committed to create more then 500 job opportunities for local people. China has often been accused of valuing profits over peace, and though there have been calls for Chinese leaders to use their economic clout to speak out against human rights abuses in Africa. Generally, silence has been the response. In the last year, China increased its development aid budget by nearly $12 billion. That may be a sign that China is ready to use soft power. The effects of that are seen as African children play and sing in Mandarin. Now, you might not associate India with wine but the local industry has been growing over the past decade and right now, one particular type of drink is getting plenty of attention from both consumers and investors. As part of our Taste of Asia series, Simon Atkinson reports on some of India’s top drops. The popping of corks and the pouring of bubbles are most famously linked with champagne, the exclusive and often expensive drink from France. But what is being served here is from far closer to home. Events like this aim to promote Indian—made sparkling wine to the country’s growing middle—class. It has being billed as up—market and affordable and there certainly seems to be a thirst for it. Chandon launched here a few years ago and is one of half a dozen brands now available on the market. A bottle in the shops will cost you just under $20, one quarter of the price of an imported champagne. While made locally, its owner is Moet Hennessey, the French luxury drinks brand with an eye on the emerging economies. Why India? First, before everything, India is a great market where fine wine and spirits are being consumed. It is the number two market for whiskey. And there are young individuals who have studied abroad and have improved their incomes and who want to enjoy fine, luxury Indian—made products. Almost all of India’s wine industry is based about 175 kilometres from Mumbai. These grapes are being picked for the country’s biggest winemaker, Sula, but when it comes to making sparkling wine, it has had to adapt to the geographic and economic realities. When we started, we were looking for the classic champagne varieties but the Indian climate is completely different and it is difficult to grow for chardonnay and pinot noir. Sparkling wine has become one of Sula’s best money spinners. It already sells hundreds of thousands of bottles each year. And if more Indians try a drink traditionally used for celebration, that will be cause to celebrate here as well.

The top stories this hour: Police in Texas have denied they edited a video showing the arrest of a woman who later died in their custody. They blamed technical glitches for apparentjumps in the film and have released a new version of the footage. Air quality levels in almost 200 Chinese cities have improved thanks to stricter enforcement of penalties but China’s air quality still falls below global standards. A British woman has died while bungeejumping from a bridge in Spain. Clayo De Abreu, who was 23 and from London, was killed in the Andalucia region. Elizabeth Glinka reports. This is the Tablate Bridge in the Alpujarras mountains. A well—known bungee site, popular with local adventure companies, who charge around 35 euros for the chance to dive over 80 metres into the ravine below. On a normal dayjumpers are helped to dismount onto the older stone bridge beneath. But yesterday afternoon something went wrong. Police say a possibla misalculation with the rope is one line of enquiry. Local officials say 23—year—old Kleyo De Abreu was staying with family in the region and that her aunt was present when she jumped. It is not clear if she did so as part of an organised trip. The exact cause of death is not known, but a local English—language paper is reporting the young woman hit the side of the bridge, causing fatal head injuries. The Foreign Office says it is liaising with Spanish authorities and is in contact with the family to offer support at this difficult time. Herfather, Bernard Atwell, has described his daughter as sweet, caring, bubbly and focused. He said: Family and friends have paid tributes to a 12—year—old girl from Hull who died during a school holiday in France. Jessica Lawson was involved in what’s been described as a swimming accident on a lake at an activity centre in Liginiac on Tuesday. She was taken to hospital in Limoges but died on Wednesday morning. French radio reports said she was among a groupjumping from a pontoon which had overturned. One of the crew travelling in the bin lorry that crashed in Glasgow last December, killing six people, has been describing his frantic efforts to revive the driver. At the inquiry into the accident, Matthew Telford told of his panic when he realised that Harry Clarke was slumped unconscious at the wheel. He said he hit Mr Clarke on the back and screamed, ""You’re killing people, Harry!"" Time now for all the sports news in Sport Today. Hello, I’m Marc Edwards, and this is Sport Today. Coming up on our programme: The Reggae Boyz’ best ever result. Jamaica beat the USA in the CONCACAF Gold Cup semi finals. Tour De France contender Tejay Van garderen withdraws from the race, while Chris Froome fights off the challengers. —— Tour De France contender Tejay Van Garderen withdraws from the race, while Chris Froome fights off the challengers. And the rise of the robots. It’s the 19th Robocup. We’ll have robot football for you. Hello, thanks forjoining us here on Sport Today. We’re going to start with the biggest upset at this year’s CONCACAF Gold Cup. Jamaica have beaten hosts, the USA, 2—1 in the semi finals at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta. The Reggae Boyz had never even reached the last four of the competition before, but they showed no nerves as Darren Mattocks opened the scoring for them on the half hour, before Giles Barnes scored with a beautiful free kick six minutes later to double that lead. Michael Bradley pulled one back for the US just after half time, but that’s how it would end. Jamaica become the first Carribean side to make the final of the CONCACAF Gold Cup, while the USA go out at the semis for the first time since 2003 at the biennial tournament. So, confirmation of that upset in Atlanta. They’ll play either Mexico or Panama in the final. That semi kicks off in around 15 minutes, also at the Georgia Dome English Premier League champions Chelsea are playing a friendly in the United States. They’re visiting MLS side the New York Red Bulls. Approaching half—time it is 1—0. Four Chelsea fans have been banned from attending all football matches globally for up to five years for their role in a racist attack in Paris. A black commuter was refused entry onto a train by the Chelsea supporters ahead of their Champions League match against Paris Saint—Germain last February. BBC correspondent Daniela Relph has the story. Richard Barklie is a former police officer from Northern Ireland, now director of a human rights organisation. Today a judge said he was a man whose behaviour at football didn’t match the picture painted of him away from the game. The mobile phone footage ahead of Chelsea’s Champions League game in Paris in February was described as compelling from the judge. He said it showed Chelsea fans displaying aggressive, disorderly and at times racist conduct as a black commuter tried to board a Metro train. He’s pushed off and shouted at, while the fans make racist and xenophobic chants. 20—year—old Josh Parsons was another fan banned for five years today. His behaviour described on the night as agitated, racist and xenophobic. Two others were punished — Jordan Mundie receiving a three—year ban for his part in the aggression, and William Simpson, filmed earlier with his hood up, now has a five—year ban, told by thejudge, you can run with the mob but you can’t hide. As well as being banned from watching Chelsea in all other football matches, the four men will have to hand in their passports during significant international games and tournaments. Ghanaian midfielder Emmanuel Frimpong has called the Russian Football Union ""beyond a joke"" after he was handed a two—game ban for reacting to alleged racist abuse. The former Arsenal midfielder said he was the subject of monkey chants before being sent off for a gesture playing for club side Ufa against Spartak Moscow. Spartak will not be punished, as the RFU said it found no evidence of racism. Frimpong tweeted: ""For the Russian FA to say they didn’t hear or see any evidence of racism is beyond a joke."" Earlier this week, Zenit St Petersburg’s Brazilian striker Hulk claimed racism happened at ""almost every game"" in the Russian league. With the English Premier League kicking off in 2.5 weeks, the transfer window continues to heat up. We’ve got confirmation of a big signing by Liverpool. They’ve paid Aston Villa $50.75 million for the services of striker Cristian Benteke. The Belgian international scored 49 goals in 101 games for Villa after signing from Genk for $11 million in 2012. The 24—year—old has agreed a long—term contract at Anfield thought to be for five years and becomes their second most expensive signing. He knocked Liverpool out of the semi—final of the FA Cup when he played from the middle. He comes alive. You look at him, balls from wide areas seem to favour him. That doesn’t mean he is bad through the middle as well. Not at all. He is very quick, strong and aggressive, and that is something we don’t have. Look at his trike rate, it is one in every two. That’s what we need. Last year we had four strikers who only scored eight goals between them for different reasons. He is a massive presence. He can put himself about. It will take weight off the likes of Coutinho, Firminho and whoever is playing alongside him. Well, what does that mean for Mario Balotelli? Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers insists the Italian’s future at the club lies in the player’s own hands. Balotelli was left out of the squad for the tour of the Far East, and managed just one Premier League goal last season. The arrival of Christian Benteke has led to suggestions that Balotelli is bound for the Anfield door, but Rodgers, speaking ahead of his side’s tour match in Malaysia, was less certain. Just a warning, there is some flash photography coming up. That’ll be entirely up to Mario. As I have said, he was working very I have said, he was working very hard to get fit and that’s something hard to get fit and that’s something that, you know, we will see when the that, you know, we will see when the season begins. Last season was a season begins. Last season was a disappointment for us, so we had to disappointment for us, so we had to ensure that we would ring in the ensure that we would ring in the quality of player needed to help us quality of player needed to help us improve and we have certainly done improve and we have certainly done that with the quality and the that with the quality and the mentality of the player was mentality of the player was important —— bring.

I have an inherent belief that the players we inherent belief that the players we have brought in can help us push on have brought in ran help us push on their have brought in can help us push on their season. To cycling now. Tour De France leader Chris Froome fended off several attacks in stage 17 from Digne—les—Bains to Pra Loup. American Tejay van Garderen withdrew from cycling’s ultimate race, after starting Wednesday in third place. His BMC team say he was suffering from headaches. Meanwhile, Britain’s Froome successfully countered attacks from nearest rival Nairo Quintana, early and late on, in the ride through the Alps. So the Team Sky Rider maintains his 3 minute lead. Alberto Contador lost time with a crash on the final ascent. He sits fifth. German Simon Geschke was the day’s hero winning the 161km stage. Pakistan beat Sri Lanka by seven wickets in the fourth one—day international in Colombo. They’ve taken an unassailable 3—1 lead in the five—match series. Jim Lumsden reports. At 2—1 down in the five—match series, Sri Lanka captain Angelo Matthews put faith in his batsmen to set the pace. That faith proved wrong. Carerra falling on the second ball. Dilshan got them back on track, adding 109 for the second wicket. The skipper went cheaply, causing a The remaining seven batsmen mustered just 90 runs. Thirimanne batted well, but he was caught on 90. 256 the target, and Pakistan took little time hunting it down, Ali and Shezad racking up quickfire 505 between them. The incoming Muhamed Hafiz produced a century partnership, taking them towards victory. Muhamed Fahiz followed his teammate shortly, after the job was done. Ahmed and Malik took them over the line with seven wickets and nine overs in hand. Malik’s fourth six here the fitting way to win the match, but there are still a matche remaining. And finally the rise of the robots, could they soon become better at football than human beings? The answer is an emphatic no. Well, not yet, anyway, as you’ll see in our next report. but the 19th RoboCup games have been taking place in Heifei, China. Australia’s University of New South Wales defeated the University of Bremen to defend their world title. Paul Frostick has been watching the robot invasion. The competition saw more than 300 teams from 47 countries participate, according to Chinese state media. For the main event, the teams run their own programmes on a 58 centimetre tall robot. Once the competition starts, the robots are on their own with the teams not allowed to interfere with the programme. They tell everyone else where they are on the field and where the ball is and make decisions. Maybe one player will be goalkeeper and another says, I am closest, I will kick it, and someone else, I will pass it here or I am standing here, and they try to position around the field and things like that, and they share that information so that everyone knows what everyone’s doing. In addition to the standard robots, competitions for medium—sized and humanoid robots were also run. So, what is the point of all this? It’s hoped the development in robotics technology will mean a robot team ran beat a human team one day. Not at that stage yet, however, Wednesday’s audience still found it exciting. TRANSLATION: What impresses me the most is when the robots are knocked down, they get up by themselves. I also enjoy the goals and many other exciting moments. All that left an impression. Aside from football, the competition also showcases the development Aside from football, the competition also showcases the development in robotics, such as search and rescue and uses in human society. On the football side, it could make for an interesting transfer window. You can get all the latest sports news at our website — that’s bbc.com/sport. But from me and the rest of the Sport Today team, goodbye. Hello. The forecast for Friday is giving us a few headaches at the moment. Shorterterm, it’s a little more more straightforward. We’ve got an area of low pressure to the north of the UK, bringing breezy weather to northern parts. Quiet and settled further south. This low pressure system is the problem for Friday. Just determining exactly how far north it will come. In the shorter term for Thursday, a largely dry day for much of England and Wales. Starting the day with maybe one or two light showers across the south—west. But sunny spells elsewhere. After a cool start, temperatures getting up quickly into the midteens. Some patchy cloud drifting through on those fairly light breezes. The breeze is more noticeable as you go into Northern Ireland, and northern most counties of England and Scotland, where winds will be rattling through some showers. Some will be on the heavy side. Not many showers getting across the eastern side of the Grampians. Little change through the rest of the day. Still a scattering of showers for Scotland and Northern Ireland. Showers across England and Wales are few and far between. Most places stay dry. Light winds, feeling warm in England and Walas. The breeze will provide a cool edge to a good part of Scotland and Northern Ireland. Friday is a bit of a problem and it is all down to this low pressure. A lot of uncertainty as to how far north it will come. The best estimate at the moment is that the heaviest rain looks most likely to be across southern parts of England and Wales, but it is possible that the rain could get up to, well, north Wales, Manchester, across much of the Midlands. This is how we see things most likely at the moment. But as I say, there is uncertainty as we go further north. More certain about the forecast for Scotland and Northern Ireland. Here, a scattering of showers. But many places staying dry. Relatively light winds. Temperature generally still below average for the time of year. Mid—to—high teens at best for most areas. And then, as the weather system pulls away during Friday evening and Friday night, there are strong winds for a time, even gales, across East Anglia and the south—east as the heavy rain pulls away, but for most places on Saturday end up with a decent day. A few showers in Scotland and England. Elsewhere, should be dry, light winds and sunshine coming through. Again, temperatures a bit below where you might see them at this time of year. The second half of the weekend turns more unsettled. Cloud and rain edging in from the west, meaning many eastern areas will have a fine day, before the rain arrives later on in the day. But still, a bit on the cool side for now. Welcome to BBC News, broadcasting to viewers on public television in the US and around the globe. My name’s Mike Embley. Our top stories: Police in the US state of Texas deny editing a video, which shows the arrest of a black woman who later died in custody. Do you want a pay rise with that? Aland mark ruling sees a 70% salary increase for New York’s fast—food workers. Four Chelsea football fans who repeatedly pushed a black Frenchman off the Paris Metro have been banned from matches for up to five years. Could this be the world’s oldest Koran? Fragments thought to be1,400 years old are found on a shelf in Britain. Hello. Police in Texas investigating the death of a black woman in their custody have released a revised version of the video that shows her arrest. They deny their initial video was edited. They blame the jumps and overlaps in it on glitches. The case of Sandra Bland is the latest to put a strain on relations between African—Americans and police in the US. The sheriff in charge of the jail where she was found hanged says she told a guard she had previously attempted suicide. The BBC’s Gary O’Donoghue reports. July 10, a highwayjust outside Houston, Texas, and Sandra Bland is stopped for failing to signal when changing lanes. Hello, ma’am. It starts off relatively calmly. The police officer goes back to his own car. And a few minutes later he returns, and tensions start to rise. You seem very irritated. I am, I really am. And then the real spark, over a cigarette. Do you mind putting out your cigarette, please? I am in my car, I don’t have to put out my cigarette. Well, you can step out now. I don’t have to step out. Step out of the car. No, you do not have the right to do that. I do have the right, new step out or I will remove you. As things get worse, the officer pulls a stun gun and issues a threat. Get out of the car! Get out! Now! You are doing all this for a failure to signal. Get over here. Right, yeah. Let’s take this to court. As the two moved out of the camera’s view, the argument escalates further. Afterwards, Sandra Bland is taken to Waller County Jail. Three days later, just after 9:003m onJuly 13, she was found hanging in her cell. Attempts to resuscitate her were unsuccessful. The death is now being investigated by the local district attorney, and police are facing severe criticism for apparently editing the original dashcam video. Here is one example. You see the truck driver get out of his cab and walk away, reappearing in the same position a few moments later. The Texas Department for Public Safety says there was a glitch on the video when it was uploaded and have now released a new set of footage. Meanwhile, Sandra Bland’s family says there has to be an independent autopsy to look at how she died, as they do not believe she killed herself. Sandy was pulled over for failure to indicate a proper lane change, and looking at that as her sister, I feel the officer was picking on her. Kurdish militants have claimed responsibility for killing two police officers in Turkey. They say it was retaliation for the suicide bombing in the border city of Suruc near Syria, which killed 32 young activists. Turkish officials say the bomber was a 20—year—old ethnic Kurd with links to the extremist group that calls itself Islamic State. Here’s the BBC’sJim Muir.

Four Chelsea football fans, including a man who used to be a police officer, have been banned from all matches for up to five years for their involvement in a racist incident on the Paris Metro. A fifth Chelsea supporter has already been banned for five years. Phone footage recorded in February showed a black man being shoved off a train and subjected to racist chants. There are flashing images in Daniela Relph’s report from the start. CHANTING. Paris in February of this year. Chelsea fans in the city ahead of their Champions League game. There had been tension and disorder for much of the day. Police reported heavy drinking and drug—taking amongst fans. But it was an incident on the Paris Metro that a judge described today as having tarnished the reputation of English football in Europe. Souleymane Sylla, on his way home from work, tried to get onto a Metro carriage. Chelsea fans blocked his path and pushed him off the train. He tried again, but got the same reaction amid deeply offensive chants. We’re racist, we’re racist... Today, four of those involved were punished. Richard Barklie, 50 years old, a former police officer now working in human rights, banned forfive years for aggressive conduct. Next to him, 20-year-old joshua Parsons, whose behaviour that night was described as agitated and threatening, also banned for five years. Behind him, Jordan Munday. He got a three—year ban for contributing to unacceptable behaviour. And William Simpson — anotherfive year ban. Thejudge warned him he could not hide behind the mob. REPORTER: You’re accused of being a thug. Are you a thug, Mr Simpson? As he left court today, William Simpson was asked about his behaviour that night. He said nothing. The judge told the court that the use of CCTV and phone footage meant unacceptable behaviour was now less easy to hide in the crowd. He said the conduct of the four Chelsea fans that evening in Paris was ""nasty, arrogant and abhorrent, and could not be tolerated in a civilised society."" At home in Paris, Souleymane Sylla says the experience has been hard to forget. TRANSLATION: I’m waiting for compensation, for myself and for my family. We’ve all been so traumatised by this. Thejudge said that despite much good work, football still has a racism problem and this case had highlighted that. Daniela Relph, BBC News, Stratford.

What may be the world’s oldest fragments of the Koran have been found at a British university. They have been carbon—dated to the seventh century. Researchers in Birmingham believe the person who wrote them could have met the Prophet Mohamed. Nick Higham has more. It is just a fragment, but it is written using an early form of Arabic script, and the words are from the Koran. They’re written on sheep or goat skin parchment and that parchment’s been radiocarbon dated to the year 645, at the latest. It could be even older. The Prophet Muhammad died in 632. If the dating of our Koran is correct, then the person who actually wrote it may well have known the Prophet Muhammad. He would have seen him, probably. He would maybe have heard him preach in Medina. He may have known him personally, and that really is quite a thought to conjure with. Muslims believe the Koran was dictated by Muhammad, and then memorised and written down, unchanged, by his immediate followers. But some Western academics think it must have evolved over many years, like the Christian Bible and theJewish Torah. This discovery is significant because it suggests the traditional Muslim account might in fact be correct. The text may indeed have been settled during the Prophet’s own lifetime. For Birmingham’s Muslim community, one of the largest in the country, it is a remarkable and emotional discovery. Myself, when I saw these pages, I was very much moved. And there were tears ofjoy and emotions in my eyes, because we’d never thought that we would have such an old copy of our holy book. I think, as a news story, it’s very good because Muslims are constantly in the headlines for the wrong reasons. The fact that they have some kind of validation for their religious tradition and the history of that tradition is important for themselves, in terms of self identity, and also it gives pride to the Muslim community as well that they have something they can reflect upon and perhaps talk to people about. And it is in Birmingham thanks to a member of the wealthy Cadbury family in the city, who bankrolled a collector of ancient manuscripts in the 19205. Nick Higham, BBC News. From history, to a very modern musical. Ben Platt is probably best known as one of the stars of Pitch Perfect, 3 Hollywood hit that has helped create a new generation of music lovers. He is now the lead in Deer Evan Hansen, 3 production that is getting its world premiere in Washington. Jane O’Brien looks at how the musicalform is being adapted to suit the audiences of today. Evan Hansen is a social misfit. You said it, and I repeated it, and it is so annoying. Real relationships are a struggle, and when a classmate dies, Evan writes a letter that leads the grieving parents to think he is their son’s best friend. It is a musical written for an audience perhaps more familiar with the TV musical drama Glee than with Oklahoma. 18—year—old Evan is played by 21—year—old Ben Platt, star of the box office musical hit Pitch Perfect. If you have modern characters in a contemporary musical, singing in a way that contemporary people can understand and relate to, it feels authentic. So I think musicals don’t feel outdated or silly to kids my age is because they have adapted to the times. Musicals are a quintessential American art form. They are subversive, sugarcoating complex issues with singalong lyrics. Dear Evan Hansen is no different, exploring teenage angst and the impact of social media. Even though we are a very connected society, we may actually not be that connected in terms of proper human connection. So when a tragedy or a loss in the community happens, it galvanises So when a tragedy or a loss in the community happens, it galvanises everyone to come together, and that is a good but a complicated thing. Is it good? Those are the things Dear Evan Hansen talks about. Aged 30 and these men already have Broadway credits. The music is poppy, with choruses anyone can sing... Even me. Very nice! Despite the upbeat tempo and zest, this particular song is actually about isolation, in a world shared online. And the rhythms and speech patterns of Dear Evan Hansen attempt to reflect that hyper—connectivity throughout the musical. 50, Broadway next. Ithink so! Because issues have changed, maybe we have the perception that the musical has changed. But I think that it’s still functioning in a similar way, taking on contemporary issues. I think the sound of the music is now reflecting more modern sounds, and we’ve piovted to make it more accessible to a modern audience. As the plot unfolds, audiences might find themselves wishing Evan, like many teenagers, would make different choices, but as long as he keeps singing, they will probably forgive him.

Shorter—term, it is a little more more straightforward. We’ve got an area of low pressure sitting to the north of the UK, bringing some breezy weather to northern parts. Quiet and settled further south. But it is this low pressure system that is the problem for Friday. Just determining exactly how far north it will come. In the shorter term for Thursday, a largely dry day for much of England and Wales. Starting the day with just maybe one or two light showers across the south-west. But sunny spells elsewhere. After a cool, fresh start, temperatures getting up quickly into the midteens. Some patchy cloud drifting through on those fairly light west to south—westerly breezes. The breeze is much more noticeable as you go into Northern Ireland, and northern most counties of England and Scotland, where winds will be rattling through some showers. Some will be on the heavy side. Probably not too many showers getting across the eastern side of the Grampians. Little change through the rest of the day. Still a scattering of showers for Scotland, perhaps Northern Ireland. Any showers across England and Wales very few and far between. Most places stay dry. Light winds, feeling warm in England and Walas. The breeze will provide a cool edge to a good part of Scotland and Northern Ireland. Friday is a bit of a problem and it is all down to this low pressure. A lot of uncertainty as to how far north it will come. The best estimate at the moment is that the heaviest rain looks most likely to be across southern parts of England and Wales, but it is possible that the leading edge of that rain could get up to, well, north Wales, Manchester, across much of the Midlands. This is how we see things most likely at the moment. But as I say, there is uncertainty as we go further north. More certain about the forecast for Scotland and Northern Ireland. Here, a scattering of showers. But many places staying dry. Relatively light winds. Temperature generally still below average for the time of year. Mid—to—high teens at best for most areas. And then, as the weather system pulls away during Friday evening and Friday night, there are strong winds for a time, even gales, across East Anglia and the south—east as the heavy rain pulls away, but most places on Saturday end up with a decent day. A few showers in Scotland and England. Elsewhere, should be dry, light winds and sunshine coming through. Again, temperatures a bit below where you might see them at this time of year. The second half of the weekend turns more unsettled. Cloud and rain edging in from the west, meaning many eastern areas will have a fine day, before the rain arrives later on in the day. But still, a bit on the cool side for now. This is BBC World News. The headlines. Greek MPs will pass a second package of reforms. The debate went until of reforms.

Now on BBC News, all the latest business news live from Singapore. South Korea’s growth slows sharply, so is MERS to blame? And time to celebrate. Why corks are popping in India’s wine industry. Welcome to Asia Business Report, live from London, with me, Alice Baxter. We begin in South Korea, where an outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, has hit the economy hard. The tourism sector has particularly struggled with visitor numbers plunging more than 40% inJune. And figures out in the last hour suggest the economy grew byjust 0.3% between April and June, less than half as fast as the previous quarter. But as you can see, the economy had actually been slowing down even before the outbreak. Earlier, I asked James Rooney of Market Force Company in Seoul what he made of these figures. First of all, it is less than what was generally expected. People were talking about a 0.8% tracking rate falling down to 0.4%, so to come in and 0.3% is below expectations. —— come in at. But more significantly than that, the MERS outbreak started in May and its impact was really felt in June, so less than one quarter could really have been affected by it. Even though the service sector is around 50% of the economy and tourism is an important part of driving that sector, the lack of international tourism and the MERS effect themselves cannot fully explain that degree of a drop. There is obviously weakness in the economy more generally. It is obviously an economy under stress. Arguably, with those numbers, June itself was presumably a negative growth rate month. As this lack of international and domestic tourism activity is still affecting South Korea this month, we must expect that the next quarter will also be negatively impacted by the weakness in the service sector. I do not expect to see a start of recovery there until September or October, when the autumn season occurs and some of the neighbouring countries have big holidays that will benefit Korea, assuming it can attract tourists back to the country. The economy shows weakness in the street. There is not the same degree of traffic on the street. Even on vacations, South Koreans are talking about staying at home and not going anywhere, and that is not going to help domestic growth because with a heavy dependence on the service sector, you need people to be out there and spending money. Domestic consumption is very important. In other news, the latest figures from Japan showed that its trade deficit narrowed sharply inJune. That’s after the value of exports jumped nearly 10%, the fastest pace in five months, thanks to strong sales of cars and electronics. Imports also fell because of low commodity prices. New York City has backed down in a row with taxi—hailing app Uber, dropping plans to limit the number of cars it operates in the city. Instead, Uber has agreed to take part in a study looking at the impact of its cars on traffic and pollution. City officials had earlier voted to call for a 1% cap on the firm’s growth in the city. India’s Adani Mining has suspended work on its Carmichael coal mine in Queensland. It blamed the move on delays in government approvals for the project, which environmentalists say could damage the Great Barrier Reef. The project is worth more than $7 billion. Now to Africa, where China is the biggest investor in the continent, with more than $200 billion in circulation. Most companies are involved in mining and infrastructure. But the relationship is notjust about economics and politics. It’s also about people and how they interact. Lerato Mbele reports. Preparing for a new world. At this school, they start young. First graders learn Mandarin as a compulsory part of the curriculum, recognition of China’s growing stature. Initially, the school was established to teach the children of Chinese families, but now the whole situation has changed in the world and we now recognise the critical value in our children learning Mandarin. It is not only the language but Chinese values are also inculcated in the teaching. Further away, outside of (“ape Town lies another testament that China has arrived. Hisense, an electronics company, set up shop here two years ago. In this factory, they produce mainly television sets and refrigerators. They produce on average three per minute. Some parts are imported, but for the fridges it is a production from the ground up. The coming of Hisense to this area has been important because for the longest time manufacturing was in serious decline and many of these workers were without a job. Now they are back on the factory floor and acquiring new skills. Over 9096 of the workforce is made up of locals. It’s not charity, it’s business. More Chinese companies are moving away from their motherland because production costs and wages are going up. With local factories, it makes us more stable and better able to control our costs. The factory was established in the 90s. Then, the unemployment rate was more than 55% and we have committed to creating more than 500 job opportunities for locals. China has often been accused of valuing profits over peace, and so there have been calls for Chinese leaders to use their economic clout to speak out against human rights abuses in Africa, generally silence has been the response. But in the last year, China increased its development aid budget by nearly $12 billion. That may be a sign that China is ready to use soft power. The effects of that are seen as African children play and sing in Mandarin. Now, you might not associate India with wine, but the local industry has been growing over the past decade and, right now, one particular type of drink is getting plenty of attention from both consumers and investors. As part of our Taste of Asia series, Simon Atkinson reports on some of India’s top drops. The popping of corks and the pouring of bubbles are most famously linked with champagne, the exclusive and often expensive drink from France. But what is being served here is from far closer to home. Events like this aim to promote Indian—made sparkling wine to the country’s growing middle—class. It has being billed as up—market and affordable and there certainly seems to be a thirst for it. Chandon launched here a few years ago and is one of half a dozen brands now available on the market. A bottle in the shops will cost you just under $20, one quarter of the price of an imported champagne. While made locally, its owner is Moet Hennessey, the French luxury drinks brand with an eye on the emerging economies. So, why India? First, before everything, India is a great market where fine wine and spirits are being consumed. It’s the number two market for whiskey. And there are new generations, young individuals who have studied abroad and have improved their incomes and who want to enjoy fine, luxury Indian—made products. Almost all of India’s wine industry is based about 175 kilometres from Mumbai. These grapes are being picked for the country’s biggest winemaker, Sula, but when it comes to making sparkling wine, it has had to adapt to the geographic and economic realities. When we started, we were looking for the classic champagne varieties but the Indian climate is completely different and it is difficult to grow for chardonnay and pinot noir. Sparkling wine has become one of Sula’s best money spinners. It already sells hundreds of thousands of bottles each year. And, if more Indians try a drink traditionally used for celebration, that will be cause to celebrate here as well. Let’s have a look at the markets. InJapan, the Nikkei has opened.

Hello, I’m Marc Edwards and this is Sport Today, live from the BBC Sports Centre. Coming up on our programme: The Reggae Boyz’s best ever result. Jamaica beat the USA in the CONCACAF Gold Cup semi—finals. Tour de France contender Tejay van Garderen withdraws from the race, while Chris Froome fights off the challengers. And the rise of the robots. It is the 19th Robocup. We will have robot football for you. Hello, thanks forjoining us on Sport Today. We are going to start with the biggest upset at this year’s CONCACAF Gold Cup. Jamaica have beaten hosts the USA 2—1 in the semi—finals at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta. The Reggae Boyz had never even reached the last four of the competition before, but they showed no nerves, as Darren Mattocks opened the scoring for them on the half—hour, before Giles Barnes scored with a beautifulfree kick six minutes later, to double that lead. Michael Bradley pulled one back for the US just after half—time, but that is how it would end. Jamaica become the first Caribbean side to make the final of the CONCACAF Gold Cup. So, confirmation of that upset in Atlanta. They will play either Mexico or Panama in the final. That were so, it is also taking place at the Georgia to —— 0— zero place at the Georgia to -- 0- zero in that one place at the Georgia to —— 0— zero in that one so far, it is also in that one so far, it is also taking place at the Georgia Dome. English Premier League champions Chelsea are over in the United States. They are playing MLS side the New York Red Bulls, and it may only be a preseason friendly, butJose Mourinho and his men will not be too happy conceding four goals to the American side. There is around five minutes to go. ii It is still 4—2. Meanwhile, four Chelsea fans have been banned from attending all football matches globally for up to five years, for their role in a racist incident in Paris. A black commuter was refused entry onto a train by the Chelsea supporters ahead of their Champions League match against Paris Saint—Germain last February. BBC correspondent Daniela Relph has the story. Richard Barklie is a former police officer from Northern Ireland, now director of a human rights organisation. Today, a judge said he was a man whose behaviour at football did not match the picture painted of him away from the game. The mobile phone footage filmed ahead of Chelsea’s Champions League game in Paris in February was described as compelling by the judge. He said it showed Chelsea fans displaying aggressive, disorderly, and at times racist conduct, as a black commuter tried to board a Metro train. He is pushed off and shouted at, while the fans make racist and xenophobic chants. 20—year—old Josh Parsons was another fan banned for five years today. His behaviour on the night described as agitated, racist and xenophobic. Two others were punished. Jordan Mundie receiving a three—year ban from attending football for his part in the aggression, and William Simpson, filmed earlier this year with his hood up, now has a five-year ban, told bythe judge, ""you ran with the mob, but you can’t hide."" As well as being banned from watching Chelsea in all other football matches, the four men will have to hand in their passports during significant international games and tournaments. Ghanaian midfielder Emmanuel Frimpong has called the Russian Football Union beyond a joke, after he was handed a two—game ban for reacting to alleged racist abuse. The former Arsenal midfielder said he was the subject of monkey chants, before being sent off for a gesture, while playing for club side Ufa against Spartak Moscow. Spartak will not be punished, as the RFU said it found no evidence of racism. Frimpong tweeted: For the Russian FA to say they didn’t hear or see any evidence of racism is beyond a joke. Earlier this week, Zenit St Petersburg’s Brazilian striker Hulk claimed racism happened at almost every game in the Russian league. English Premier League club Liverpool have signed striker Christian Benteke from Aston Villa for $50.75 million. The Belgian international scored 49 goals in 101 games for Villa, after moving from Genk for $11 million back in 2012. The 24—year—old has agreed a long—term contract at Anfield, thought to be for five years, and becomes their second most expensive signing. He knocked Liverpool out of the semi—final of the FA Cup when he played through the middle. You ask Aston Villa players, he comes alive. You look at him, balls from wide areas seem to favour him. That doesn’t mean he is bad through the middle as well. Not at all. He is very quick, very strong and aggressive, and that is something we don’t have. Look at his strike rate, it is one in every two. That’s what we need. Last year we had four strikers who only scored eight goals between them for different reasons. He is a massive presence. He can put himself about. It will take weight off the likes of Coutinho, Firminho and whoever is playing alongside him. So, what does that signing mean for Mario Balotelli? Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers insists the Italian’s future at the club lies in the player’s own hands. Balotelli was left out of the squad for the tour of the Far East, and managed just one Premier League goal last season. The arrival of Christian Benteke has led to suggestions that Balotelli is bound for the Anfield door. But Rodgers, speaking ahead of his sides tour match in Malaysia, was less certain. Just a warning, there is some flash photography coming up. That’ll be entirely up to Mario. As I have said, he was working very hard to get fit and that’s something that, you know, we will see when the season begins. Last season was a disappointment for us, so we had to ensure that we would bring in the quality of player needed to help us improve and we have certainly done that with the quality and the mentality of the player was important. I have an inherent belief that the players we have brought in can help us push on their season. Tour de France leader Chris Froome fended off several attacks in stage 17 from Digne—les—bains to Pra Loup. American Tejay van Garderen withdrew from cycling’s ultimate race, after starting Wednesday in third place. His BMC team say he was suffering from headaches. Meanwhile Britain’s Froome successfully countered attacks from nearest rival Nairo Quintana, early and late on, in the ride through the Alps. So the Team Sky rider maintains his three minute and ten second lead. Alberto Contador lost time with a crash on the final ascent. He now sits in fifth. The German Simon Geschke was the day’s hero winning the 161—kilometres stage. Pakistan beat Sri Lanka by seven wickets in the fourth one—day international in Colombo. They’ve taken an unassailable 3—1 lead in the five—match series. Jim Lumsden reports. At 2-1 down in the five-match series, Sri lanka captain Angelo Matthews put faith in his batsmen to set the pace. That faith proved misplaced, Carerra falling on just the second ball of the day. Dilshan got them back on track, adding 109 for the second wicket. The skipper went cheaply, causing a collapse. The remaining seven batsmen mustered just 90 runs. Thirimanne batted well, but he was caught on 90. 256 the target, and Pakistan took little time hunting it down, Ali and Shezad racking up a quickfire 50 between them. The incoming Muhamed Hafiz produced a century partnership, as the tourists eased towards victory. Muhamed Fahiz followed his teammate shortly after, but the job had been done. Ahmed and Malik took them over the line with seven wickets and nine overs in hand. Malik’s fourth six here the fitting way to win the match, but there are still a matche remaining. And finally the rise of the robots, could they soon become better at football than human beings? The answer is an emphatic no. Well, not yet anyway, as you’ll see in our next report. but the 19th RoboCup games have been taking place in Heifei, China. Australia’s University of New South Wales defeated the University of Bremen to defend their world title. Paul Frostick has been watching the robot invasion. The competition saw more than 300 teams from 47 countries participate, according to Chinese state media. For the main event, the teams run their own programmes on a 58—centimetre—tall robot. Once the competition starts, the robots are on their own, with the teams not allowed to interfere with the programming. They tell everyone else where they are on the field and where the ball is, and then they make decisions. Maybe one player will be goalkeeper, and another says, I am closest, I will kick it, and someone else, I will pass it here or I am standing here, and they try to position around the field and things like that, and then they share that information and everyone knows what everyone’s doing. In addition to the standard robots, competitions for medium—sized and humanoid robots were also run. So, what is the point in all this? It is hoped the development in robotics technology will mean a robot team can beat a human team one day. Not at that stage yet, however, Wednesday’s audience still found it exciting. TRANSLATION: What impresses me the most is that when the robots are knocked down, they ran get up by themselves. I also enjoy the goals, and many other exciting moments. All that left an impression. Aside from football, the competition also showcases the development in robotics, such as search and rescue, and uses in human society. On the football side, it could make for an interesting transfer window. I’m not sure any of those robots will be getting signed yet. From me will be getting signed yet. From me and the rest of the sports at 18, and the rest of the sports at 18, goodbye for now. —— Sport Today goodbye for now. -- Sport Today team. goodbye for now. -- Sport Today team. Hello.

Police in Texas investigating the death of a black woman in their custody have released a revised version of the video that shows her arrest. They deny their initial video was edited. They blame the jumps and overlaps in it on ""glitches"". The case of Sandra Bland is the latest to put a strain on relations between African—Americans and police in the US. The sheriff in charge of the jail where she was found hanged says she told a guard she had previously attempted suicide. The BBC’s Gary O’Donoghue reports. July 10, a highwayjust outside Houston, Texas, and Sandra Bland is stopped forfailing to signal when changing lanes. Hello, ma’am. It starts off relatively calmly. The police officer goes back to his own car. And a few minutes later he returns, and tensions start to rise. You seem very irritated. I am, I really am. And then the real spark, over a cigarette. Do you mind putting out your cigarette, please? I am in my car, I don’t have to put out my cigarette. Well, you can step out now. I don’t have to step out. Step out of the car. No, you do not have the right to do that. I do have the right, new step out or I will remove you. As things get worse, the officer pulls a stun gun and issues a threat. Get out of the car! Get out! Now! You are doing all this for a failure to signal. Get over there. Right, yeah. Let’s take this to court. As the two moved out of the camera’s view, the argument escalates further. Afterwards, Sandra Bland is taken to Waller County Jail. Three days later, just after 9:003m onJuly 13, she was found hanging in her cell. Attempts to resuscitate her were unsuccessful. The death is now being investigated by the local district attorney, and police are facing severe criticism for apparently editing the original dashcam video. Here is one example. You see the truck driver get out of his cab and walk away, reappearing in the same position a few moments later. The Texas Department for Public Safety says there was a glitch on the video when it was uploaded and have now released a new set of footage. Meanwhile, Sandra Bland’s family says there has to be an independent autopsy to look at how she died, as they do not believe she killed herself. Sandy was pulled over for failure to indicate a proper lane change, and looking at that as her sister, I feel the officer was picking on her. Greek MPs have voted to pass a second package of reforms, to secure a new international bailout. The bill, containing judicial and banking reforms, easily passed with the support of 230 lawmakers in the 300 seat parliament. Pro—Euro opposition parties voted with the government. But 31 out of 149 deputies from his Syriza party voted against or obstained. This result means Greece has fulfilled its side of the agreement dating from the eurozone summit earlier this month and negotiations for a third bailout can now take place. Kurdish militants have claimed responsibility for killing two police officers in Turkey. They say it was retaliation for the suicide bombing in the border city of Suruc, near Syria, which killed 32 young activists. Turkish officials say the bomber was a 20—year—old ethnic Kurd with links to the extremist group that calls itself Islamic State. Here’s the BBC’sJim Muir. The Turkish government has now relaxed that ban on access to Twitter after imposing it for a day or so. It has been thought that the reason for the ban was simply to prevent people disseminating pictures of that horrible bomb explosion down here in southern Turkey on Monday in which more than 32 people, or around 32, were killed in a suicide blast. Also, perhaps the government was hoping to prevent that social media being used as a way of mobilising people to take part in the demonstrations that have been happening, more of which are planned, against the government and the authorities. Demonstrators accuse the government of turning a blind eye to some of Islamic State’s activities and not doing enough to protect the Kurds. The man who carried out that attack, we are told, has been identified by DNA as a 20—year—old student from south—east Turkey. He is believed to have been Kurdish and to have had links with Islamic State and had perhaps been into Syria just across the border from here for training or indoctrination by the so—called Islamic State. Let’s round up some other main stories. White House officials say plans to close the American prison camp at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba are in the final stages. President Obama pledged to close it on the day he took office in 2009, but has faced obstacles. 122 men are still in detention, accused of being enemy combatants from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. American officials have given the oil giant Royal Dutch Shell approval to begin exploratory drilling in the Arctic. The company will only be able at first to drill the top sections of the wells, because essential emergency equipment is not yet on site. It’s believed there are 15 billion barrels of oil under the sea off the north west coast of Alaska. A joint operation by the Colombian military and FARC rebels has restarted, to remove some of the thousands of mines placed by the rebels in more than half a century of conflict. Work stopped a week ago when a soldier was killed. Colombia has the third largest number of accidents caused by mines, after Cambodia and Afghanistan. After a four—year campaign to raise the minimum wage, fast food workers in New York are going to get a big pay rise. A panel appointed by the state governor, Andrew Cuomo, has recommended that pay in fast food chains should be increased from just under $9 an hour to $15. This affects only fast food restaurants that are a chain and restaurants that are a chain and have a certain number of have a certain number of restaurants. But in general the fast restaurants.

Four Chelsea football fans, including a man who used to be a police officer, have been banned from all matches for up to five years for their involvement in a racist incident on the Paris Metro. A fifth Chelsea supporter has already been banned for five years. Phone footage recorded in February showed a black man being shoved off a train and subjected to racist chants. There are flashing images in Daniela Relph’s report, from the start. CHANTING. Paris in February of this year. Chelsea fans in the city ahead of their Champions League game. There had been tension and disorder for much of the day. Police reported heavy drinking and drug—taking amongst fans. But it was an incident on the Paris Metro that a judge described today as having tarnished the reputation of English football in Europe. Souleymane Sylla, on his way home from work, tried to get onto a Metro carriage. Chelsea fans blocked his path and pushed him off the train. He tried again, but got the same reaction amid deeply offensive chants. We’re racist, we’re racist... Today, four of those involved were punished. Richard Barklie, 50 years old, a former police officer now working in human rights, banned forfive years for aggressive conduct. Next to him, 20-year-old joshua Parsons, whose behaviour that night was described as agitated and threatening, also banned for five years. Behind him, Jordan Munday. He got a three—year ban for contributing to unacceptable behaviour. And William Simpson — anotherfive year ban. Thejudge warned him he could not hide behind the mob. REPORTER: You’re accused of being a thug. Are you a thug, Mr Simpson? As he left court today, William Simpson was asked about his behaviour that night. He said nothing. The judge told the court that the use of CCTV and phone footage meant unacceptable behaviour was now less easy to hide in the crowd. He said the conduct of the four Chelsea fans that evening in Paris was ""nasty, arrogant and abhorrent, and could not be tolerated in a civilised society."" At home in Paris, Souleymane Sylla says the experience has been hard to forget. TRANSLATION: I’m waiting for compensation, for myself and for my family. We’ve all been so traumatised by this. Thejudge said that despite much good work, football still has a racism problem and this case had highlighted that. Daniela Relph, BBC News, Stratford. California’s Supreme Court has cleared the way for a sexual abuse lawsuit to be brought against the veteran actor and entertainer Bill Cosby. He’s facing a series of historic sexual assault allegations dating back several decades. The 78—year—old denies all the claims. Eadier, I spoke to the 5505 David Willis in Los Angeles for the latest.

But what has the man who made much of his Kenyan roots done or going to do for the country of one half of his family? Alastair Leithead reports from Nairobi. They consider him America’s first Kenyan President. ii It is going to be a blast for me. It is one of the few places he can come and still feel a little love. For Africans, he is the first black President, and he has some roots from Kenya. So I think he is a great person. Headline writers may call it Obama—mania. And while the gloss has come off his presidency, his colours are still bright here in Kenya. He stumbled onto the African stage last year, more than halfway through his presidency, by bringing African leaders to America, and offering more investment in trade rather than aid. It seemed like a bit of a scramble against China’s growing influence. But, as in many places, America’s focus is on security. Arguably, this is where America’s War on Terror began. This is the site of the US embassy that was destroyed in 1998 in a bomb attack, the same day that the embassy was targeted in Dares Salaam. This is a memorialfor those who died, many of these Kenyan. President Obama will visit here as part of his trip, and it is also where the security relationship between America and Kenya began, one that has only strengthened as Al—Shabaab have been carrying out attacks outside of Somalia, to here in the heart of Kenya. The assault on the Westgate Mall two years ago opened everyone’s eyes to what they were capable of. The shocking student massacre in April showed security is still lacking. Part of the Kenyan coast remains out of bounds. Talks about closer cooperation in the fight against corruption are firmly on the agenda, especially new President Kenyatta’s international criminal court case has been dropped. We have been working in very close collaboration with American agencies in ourfight against terror, and I am certain that that is an agenda that we will further strengthen during this particular meeting, strengthen our partnership, strengthen our cooperation. The last time Senator Obama visited the country of his father, he looked somewhat younger. A trip to see his family is unlikely, but his uncle thinks there is plenty of time for that. I believe he is going to be more helpful to this place while out of the office than when he is still in the office, because right now there are quite a lot of constraints attached. We know about his family’s past, but what about his future? what is and what will be the African lagacy of America’s first black President? With President Bush, with President Clinton, we actually felt an immediate change. Perhaps judging Obama’s legacy and impact is going to need a bit more time. So that we start to look at trade figures over time. Marks out of ten? I would say maybe five out of ten. That doesn’t sound like very much. No, no, no, but I would also give a caveat that you need a bit of time. It is too early to assess. Concreting over the cracks, short—term visits are fine. But Kenya need something more solid to build on. Growing trade, investment and investing in the causes of insecurity, rather than just a quick fix, is what President Obama can help deliver. What may be the world’s oldest fragments of the Koran have been found at a British university. They have been carbon—dated to the seventh century. Researchers in Birmingham believe the person who wrote them could have met the Prophet Mohamed. Nick Higham has more. It is just a fragment, but it is written using an early form of Arabic script, and the words are from the Koran. They are written on sheep or goat skin parchment, and that parchment has been radiocarbon dated to the year 645, at the latest. It could be even older. The Prophet Muhammad died in 632. If the dating of our Koran is correct, then the person who actually wrote it may well have known the Prophet Muhammad. He would have seen him, probably. He would maybe have heard him preach in Medina. He may have known him personally, and that really is quite a thought to conjure with. Muslims believe the Koran was dictated by Muhammad, and then memorised and written down, unchanged, by his immediate followers. But some Western academics think it must have evolved over many years, like the Christian Bible and theJewish Torah. This discovery is significant because it suggests the traditional Muslim account might in fact be correct. The text may indeed have been settled during the Prophet’s own lifetime. For Birmingham’s Muslim community, one of the largest in the country, it is a remarkable and emotional discovery. Myself, when I saw these pages, I was very much moved. And there were tears ofjoy and emotions in my eyes, because we’d never thought that we would have such an old copy of our holy book. I think, as a news story, it’s very good because Muslims are constantly in the headlines for the wrong reasons. And the fact that they have some kind of validation for their religious tradition and the history of that tradition is important for themselves, in terms of self-identity, and also it gives pride to the Muslim community as well that they have something they can reflect upon and perhaps talk to people about. And it is in Birmingham thanks to a member of the wealthy Cadbury family in the city, who bankrolled a collector of ancient manuscripts in the 19205. Nick Higham, BBC News. Ben Platt is probably best known as one of the stars of Pitch Perfect, 3 Hollywood hit that has helped create a new generation of music lovers. He is now the lead in Deer Evan Hansen, 3 production that is getting its world premiere in Washington. Jane O’Brien looks at how the musicalform is being adapted to suit the audiences of today. Evan Hansen is a social misfit. Just because, you know, you said it, and I repeated it, and it is so annoying when people do that. Real relationships are a struggle, and when a classmate dies, Evan writes a letter that leads the grieving parents to think he is their son’s best friend. It is a musical written for an audience perhaps more familiar with the TV musical drama Glee than with Oklahoma. 18—year—old Evan is played by 21—year—old Ben Platt, star of the box office musical hit Pitch Perfect. If you have modern characters in a contemporary musical, singing in a way that contemporary people can understand and relate to, it feels very authentic. And so I think musicals, the reason they don’t feel outdated or silly to people my age is because they have adapted to the times. Musicals are a quintessential American art form. They are subversive, sugarcoating complex issues with singalong lyrics. Dear Evan Hansen is no different, exploring teenage angst and the impact of social media. Even though we are a very connected society, we may actually not be that connected in terms of true human connection. So when there is something like a tragedy happens, or a loss in the community happens, it galvanises everyone to come together, and that is a good but a complicated thing. Is it a good thing? Those are the things Dear Evan Hansen talks about. Aged 30, Ben and Justin already have Broadway credits. The music is poppy, with choruses anyone can sing, even me. Very nice! Despite its upbeat tempo and zest, this particular song is actually about isolation, in a world shared online. And the rhythms and speech patterns of Dear Evan Hansen attempt to reflect that hyper—connectivity throughout the musical. 50, Broadway next. Ithink so! Because issues have changed, maybe we have the perception that the musical has changed. But I think that it’s still functioning in a similar way, I think it’s taking on contemporary issues, and I think that the sound of the music is now reflecting more modern sound, and we’ve piovted to make it more accessible to a modern audience. As the plot unfolds, audiences might find themselves wishing Evan, like many teenagers, would make different choices, but as long as he keeps singing, they will probably forgive him.

The forecast for Friday is giving us a few headaches at the moment. Shorter—term, it is a little more more straightforward. We’ve got an area of low pressure sitting to the north of the UK, bringing some breezy weather to northern parts. Fairly quiet and settled further south, but it is this low pressure system that is the problem for Friday. Just determining exactly how far north it will come. But as I say, in the shorter term for Thursday, a largely dry day for much of England and Wales. Starting the day with just maybe one or two light showers across the south—west, but sunny spells elsewhere. After a bit of a cool, fresh start, temperatures getting up quickly into the midteens, fairly widely. Some patchy cloud drifting through on those fairly light west to south—westerly breezes. The breeze much more noticeable, though, as you go into Northern Ireland, and northernmost counties of England and Scotland, where those winds will be rattling a few showers through. Some will be on the heavy side. Probably not too many showers getting across the eastern side of the Grampians. Little change, really, through the rest of the day. Still a scattering of showers for Scotland, perhaps Northern Ireland. Any showers across England and Wales very few and far between. 50 most places miss them and stay dry. With relatively light winds, feeling warm in England and Wales. That breeze, though, really quite a cool edge to it in a good part of Scotland and Northern Ireland. But then, as I say, Friday is a bit of a problem, and it is all down to this area of low pressure. A lot of uncertainty as to just how far north it will come. The best estimate at the moment is that the heaviest rain looks most likely to be across southern parts of England and Wales, but it is possible the leading edge of that rain could get up to, well, north Wales, perhaps the Manchester area, and across much of the Midlands. So this is how we see things most likely at the moment. But as I say, there is that uncertainty as we go further north. More certain about the forecast for Scotland and Northern Ireland. Here, a scattering of showers, but many places staying dry, relatively light winds. Temperature generally still below the average for the time of year. Mid—to—high teens at best for most areas. And then, as that weather system starts to pull away during Friday evening, Friday night, there could be strong winds for a time, even gales, across East Anglia and the south—east as the heavy rain pulls away. But for Saturday, most places end up with a decent day. A few showers across eastern parts of Scotland and England. Elsewhere, should be dry, fairly light winds, some sunshine coming through. Again, temperatures a bit below where you might see them at this time of year. Second half of the weekend starts to turn more unsettled once again. An area of cloud and rain slowly edging in from the west means that many eastern areas will have a fine day, before the rain arrives later on in the day. But still, a bit on the cool side for many.

Now on BBC News, all the latest business news live from Singapore. South Korea’s growth slows sharply, so is MERS to blame? And time to celebrate. Why corks are popping in India’s wine industry. Welcome to Asia Business Report, live from London, with me, Alice Baxter. We begin in South Korea, where an outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, has hit the economy hard. The tourism sector has particularly struggled with visitor numbers plunging more than 40% inJune. And figures out in the last hour suggest the economy grew byjust 0.3% between April and June, less than half as fast as the previous quarter. But as you can see, the economy had actually been slowing down even before the outbreak. Earlier, I asked James Rooney of Market Force Company in Seoul what he made of these figures. First of all, it is less than what was generally expected. People were talking about a 0.8% tracking rate falling down to 0.4%, so to come in at 0.3% is below expectations. But more significantly than that, the MERS outbreak started in May and its impact was really felt inJune, so less than one quarter could really have been affected by it. Even though the service sector is around 50% of the economy and tourism is an important part of driving that sector, the lack of international tourism and the MERS effect themselves cannot fully explain that degree of a drop. There is obviously weakness in the economy more generally. It is obviously an economy under stress. Arguably, with those numbers, June itself was presumably a negative growth rate month. As this lack of international and domestic tourism activity is still affecting South Korea this month, we must expect that the next quarter will also be negatively impacted by the weakness in the service sector. I do not expect to see a start of recovery there until September or October, when the autumn season occurs and some of the neighbouring countries have big holidays that will benefit Korea, assuming it can attract tourists back to the country. The economy shows weakness in the street. There is not the same degree of traffic on the street. Even on vacations, South Koreans are talking about staying at home and not going anywhere, and that is not going to help domestic growth because with a heavy dependence on the service sector, you need people to be out there and spending money. Domestic consumption is very important. In other news, the latest figures from Japan showed that its trade deficit narrowed sharply inJune. That’s after the value of exports jumped nearly 10%, the fastest pace in five months, thanks to strong sales of cars and electronics. Imports also fell because of low commodity prices. New York City has backed down in a row with taxi—hailing app Uber, dropping plans to limit the number of cars it operates in the city. Instead, Uber has agreed to take part in a study looking at the impact of its cars on traffic and pollution. City officials had earlier voted to call for a 1% cap on the firm’s growth in the city. India’s Adani Mining has suspended work on its Carmichael coal mine in Queensland. It blamed the move on delays in government approvals for the project, which environmentalists say could damage the Great Barrier Reef. The project is worth more than $7 billion. Now to Africa, where China is the biggest investor in the continent, with more than $200 billion in circulation. Most companies are involved in mining and infrastructure. But the relationship is notjust about economics and politics. It’s also about people and how they interact. Lerato Mbele reports. Preparing for a new world. At this school, they start young. First graders learn Mandarin as a compulsory part of the curriculum, recognition of China’s growing stature. Initially, the school was established to teach the children of Chinese families, but now the whole situation has changed in the world and we now recognise the critical value in our children learning Mandarin. It is not only the language but Chinese values are also inculcated in the teaching. Further away, outside of (“ape Town lies another testament that China has arrived. Hisense, an electronics company, set up shop here two years ago. In this factory, they produce mainly television sets and refrigerators. They produce on average three per minute. Some parts are imported, but for the fridges it is a production from the ground up. The coming of Hisense to this area has been important because for the longest time manufacturing was in serious decline and many of these workers were without a job. Now they are back on the factory floor and acquiring new skills. Over 9096 of the workforce is made up of locals. It’s not charity, it’s business. More Chinese companies are moving away from their motherland because production costs and wages are going up. With local factories, it makes us more stable and better able to control our costs. The factory was established in the 90s. Then, the unemployment rate was more than 55% and we have committed to creating more than 500 job opportunities for locals. China has often been accused of valuing profits over peace, and so there have been calls for Chinese leaders to use their economic clout to speak out against human rights abuses in Africa, generally silence has been the response. But in the last year, China increased its development aid budget by nearly $12 billion. That may be a sign that China is ready to use soft power. The effects of that are seen as African children play and sing in Mandarin. Now, you might not associate India with wine, but the local industry has been growing over the past decade and, right now, one particular type of drink is getting plenty of attention from both consumers and investors. As part of our Taste of Asia series, Simon Atkinson reports on some of India’s top drops. The popping of corks and the pouring of bubbles are most famously linked with champagne, the exclusive and often expensive drink from France. But what is being served here is from far closer to home. Events like this aim to promote Indian—made sparkling wine to the country’s growing middle—class. It has being billed as up—market and affordable and there certainly seems to be a thirst for it. Chandon launched here a few years ago and is one of half a dozen brands now available on the market. A bottle in the shops will cost you just under $20, one quarter of the price of an imported champagne. While made locally, its owner is Moet Hennessey, the French luxury drinks brand with an eye on the emerging economies. So, why India? First, before everything, India is a great market where fine wine and spirits are being consumed. It’s the number two market for whiskey. And there are new generations, young individuals who have studied abroad and have improved their incomes and who want to enjoy fine, luxury Indian—made products. Almost all of India’s wine industry is based about 175 kilometres from Mumbai. These grapes are being picked for the country’s biggest winemaker, Sula, but when it comes to making sparkling wine, it has had to adapt to the geographic and economic realities. When we started, we were looking for the classic champagne varieties but the Indian climate is completely different and it is difficult to grow for chardonnay and pinot noir. Sparkling wine has become one of Sula’s best money spinners. It already sells hundreds of thousands of bottles each year. And, if more Indians try a drink traditionally used for celebration, that will be cause to celebrate here as well.

They blamed technical glitches for apparentjumps in the film and have released a new version of the footage. A British woman has died while bungeejumping from a bridge in Spain. Kleyo De Abreu, who was 23 and from London, was killed close to the mountain village of in the Andalucia region. Sweet, caring, bubbly and focused. That’s how herfather described her. She had been visiting family in southern Spain and bungee jumped from this spot, near the Andalusian mountains. Her aunt was watching, when it is believed she hit a low bridge. The drop is 262 feet and is a popular bungeejumping site used by several adventure sports firms. Police are trying to work out whether herjump was arranged by one of these businesses. The tragedy is likely to make some thrill seekers think again. Anything like this that happens in the world affects the industry as a whole. We all look at what we do and is there anything we can do to make it safer? I am sure all companies will do that. I hope that regulations may change in Spain itself, but at the moment the tragedy of the incident is in focus. Police are investigating whether the death was caused by miscalculation with the rope, but they say it’s too early to draw any conclusions at this stage. A Foreign Office spokesman said they are liaising with authorities and are offering support to the family. Her father says he doesn’t want this to happen to anyone else, although he knows nothing will bring his beautiful daughter back.

Coming up on our programme: The Reggae Boyz’s best ever result. Jamaica beat the USA in the CONCACAF Gold Cup semi—finals. Tour de France contender Tejay van Garderen withdraws from the race, while Chris Froome fights off the challengers. And the rise of the robots. It is the 19th RoboCup. We will have robot football for you. Hello, thanks forjoining us on Sport Today. We are going to start with the biggest upset at this year’s CONCACAF Gold Cup. Jamaica have beaten hosts the USA 2—1 in the semi—finals at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta. The Reggae Boyz had never even reached the last four of the competition before, but they showed no nerves, as Darren Mattocks opened the scoring for them on the half—hour, before Giles Barnes scored with a beautifulfree kick six minutes later, to double that lead. Michael Bradley pulled one back for the US just after half—time, but that is how it would end. Jamaica become the first Caribbean side to make the final of the CONCACAF Gold Cup. So, confirmation of that upset in Atlanta. They will play either Mexico or Panama in the final. Panama are down to 10 men in their semi—final after their striker Luis Tejada was shown a straight red card afterjust 25 minutes. Incredibly, therre1-0 up with lass than 10 minutes left. And in the Copa Libertadores, Mexican side, Tigres, are on the verge of a place in the final. Trailing 2—1 from the semi final first leg, they’re up 3—0 against Brazil’s Internacional. There’s just a few minutes remaining in that match. Tigres became only the fourth Liga MX side to ever reach the semifinals of the competition and no Mexican side has ever lifted South American footballs premier club competition. Tigres one step closer to making history. The winner of this semi will play Argentina’s River Plate in the final. English Premier League champions Chelsea were badly bitten in the Big Apple. The Blues were thumped A—2 by MLS side the New York Red Bulls. Sean Davis scored twice and Franklin Castellanos had a goal and an assist as they upset the 2012 European champions. Meanwhile, four Chelsea fans have been banned from attending all football matches globally for up to five years, for their role in a racist incident in Paris. A black commuter was refused entry onto a train by the Chelsea supporters ahead of their Champions League match against Paris Saint—Germain last February. BBC correspondent Daniela Relph has the story. Richard Barklie is a former police officer from Northern Ireland, now director of a human rights organisation. Today, a judge said he was a man whose behaviour at football did not match the picture painted of him away from the game. The mobile phone footage filmed ahead of Chelsea’s Champions League game in Paris in February was described as compelling by the judge. He said it showed Chelsea fans displaying aggressive, disorderly, and at times racist conduct, as a black commuter tried to board a Metro train. He is pushed off and shouted at, while the fans make racist and xenophobic chants. 20—year—old Josh Parsons was another fan banned for five years today. His behaviour on the night described as agitated, racist and xenophobic. Two others were punished. Jordan Mundie receiving a three—year ban from attending football for his part in the aggression, and William Simpson, filmed earlier this year with his hood up, now has a five—year ban, told by thejudge, ""you can with the mob, but you can’t hide."" As well as being banned from watching Chelsea in all other football matches, the four men will have to hand in their passports during significant international games and tournaments. Ghanaian midfielder Emmanuel Frimpong has called the Russian Football Union beyond a joke, after he was handed a two—game ban for reacting to alleged racist abuse. The former Arsenal midfielder said he was the subject of monkey chants, before being sent off for a gesture, while playing for club side Ufa against Spartak Moscow. Spartak will not be punished, as the RFU said it found no evidence of racism. Frimpong tweeted: For the Russian FA to say they didn’t hear or see any evidence of racism is beyond a joke. Earlier this week, Zenit St Petersburg’s Brazilian striker Hulk claimed racism happened at almost every game in the Russian league. English Premier League club Liverpool have signed striker Christian Benteke from Aston Villa for $50.75 million. The Belgian international scored 49 goals in 101 games for Villa, after moving from Genk for $11 million back in 2012. The 24—year—old has agreed a long—term contract at Anfield, thought to be for five years, and becomes their second most expensive signing. He knocked Liverpool out of the semi—final of the FA Cup when he played through the middle. You ask Aston Villa players, he comes alive. You look at him, balls from wide areas seem to favour him. That doesn’t mean he is bad through the middle as well. Not at all. He is very quick, very strong and aggressive, and that is something we don’t have. Look at his strike rate, it is one in every two. That’s what we need. Last year we had four strikers who only scored eight goals between them for different reasons. He is a massive presence. He can put himself about. It will take weight off the likes of Coutinho, Firminho and whoever is playing alongside him. Tour de France leader Chris Froome fended off several attacks in stage 17 from Digne—les—bains to Pra Loup. American Tejay van Garderen withdrew from cycling’s ultimate race, after starting Wednesday in third place. His BMC team say he was suffering from headaches. Meanwhile Britain’s Froome successfully countered attacks from nearest rival Nairo Quintana, early and late on, in the ride through the Alps. So the Team Sky rider maintains his three minute and ten second lead. Alberto Contador lost time with a crash on the final ascent. He now sits in fifth. The German Simon Geschke was the day’s hero winning the 161—kilometres stage. Pakistan beat Sri Lanka by seven wickets in the fourth one—day international in Colombo. They’ve taken an unassailable 3—1 lead in the five—match series. Jim Lumsden reports. At 2-1 down in the five-match series, Sri lanka captain Angelo Matthews put faith in his batsmen to set the pace. That faith proved misplaced, Carerra falling on just the second ball of the day. —— Perrera. Dilshan got them back on track, adding 109 for the second wicket. Skipper Matthews went cheaply, prompting a collapse. The remaining seven batsmen mustered just 90 runs. Thirimanne batted well, but he was caught on 90. 256 the target then, and Pakistan wasted little time hunting it down, Ali and Shezad racking up a quickfire 50 between them. Shezad and the incoming Muhamed Hafiz produced a century partnership, as the tourists eased towards victory. Shezad fell short of a century. Muhamed Fahiz followed his teammate shortly after, but thejob had been done. Ahmed and Malik took them over the line with seven wickets and nine overs in hand. Malik’s fourth six here the fitting way to win the match, but there are still a matche remaining. And finally the rise of the robots, could they soon become better at football than human beings? The answer is an emphatic no. Well, not yet anyway, as you’ll see in our next report. but the 19th RoboCup games have been taking place in Heifei, China. Australia’s University of New South Wales defeated the University of Bremen to defend their world title. Paul Frostick has been watching the robot invasion. The competition saw more than 300 teams from 47 countries participate, according to Chinese state media. For the main event, the teams run their own programmes on a 58—centimetre—tall robot. Once the competition starts, the robots are on their own, with the teams not allowed to interfere with the programming. They tell everyone else where they are on the field and where the ball is, and then they make decisions. Maybe one player will be goalkeeper, and another says, I am closest, I will kick it, and someone else, I will pass it here or I am standing here, and they try to position around the field and things like that, and then they share that information and everyone knows what everyone’s doing. In addition to the standard robots, competitions for medium—sized and humanoid robots were also run. So, what is the point in all this? It is hoped the development in robotics technology will mean a robot team can beat a human team one day. Not at that stage yet, however, Wednesday’s audience still found it exciting. TRANSLATION: What impresses me the most is that when the robots are knocked down, they can get up by themselves. I also enjoy the goals, and many other exciting moments. All that left an impression. Aside from football, the competition also showcases other developments in robotics, such as search and rescue, and uses in human society. On the football side, it could make for an interesting transfer window. And finally, be careful what you write on social media. 20—year—old Julio Rey thought he’d got his dream move, plucked from the depths of Spain’s fourth tier by Deportivo La Coruna. He was on the verge of signing with the transfer already announced by the top division club last weekend. However, Depor pulled the plug at the last minute after they found out Rey had criticised them on his Twitter account three years ago. The moral of the story, never had mouth an employer or potential future employer. That is all from me. I am about to go and check my twiggy history. —— go and check my twiggy history. -- Twitter. From me and the rest of the Sport Today team, goodbye for now. Hello. The forecast for Friday is giving us a few headaches at the moment. Shorter—term, it is a little more more straightforward. We’ve got an area of low pressure sitting to the north of the UK, bringing some breezy weather to northern parts. Fairly quiet and settled further south, but it is this low pressure system that is the problem for Friday. Just determining exactly how far north it is going to come. But as I say, in the shorter term for Thursday, a largely dry day across much of England and Wales. Starting the day with just maybe one or two light showers across the south—west, but sunny spells elsewhere. After a bit of a cool, fresh start, temperatures getting up quite quickly into the midteens fairly widely. Some patchy cloud drifting through on those fairly light west to south—westerly breezes. The breeze much more noticeable, though, as you go into Northern Ireland, and northernmost counties of England and particularly Scotland, where those winds will be rattling a few showers through. Some will be on the heavy side. Probably not too many showers getting across the eastern side of the Grampians. Little change, really, through the rest of the day. Still a scattering of showers for Scotland, perhaps Northern Ireland. Any showers across England and Wales very few and far between. 50 most places miss them and stay dry. With relatively light winds, feeling reasonably warm in the sunshine in England and Wales. That breeze, though, really quite a cool edge to it in a good part of Scotland and Northern Ireland. But then, as I say, Friday is a bit of a problem, and it is all down to this area of low pressure. A lot of uncertainty as to just how far north it will come. The best estimate at the moment is that the heaviest rain looks most likely to be across southern parts of England and Wales, but it is possible the leading edge of that rain could get up to, well, north Wales, perhaps the Manchester area, and across much of the Midlands. So this is how we see things most likely at the moment. But as I say, there is that uncertainty as we go further north. More certain about the forecast for Scotland and Northern Ireland. Here, a scattering of showers, but many places staying dry, relatively light winds. Temperatures generally still below the average for the time of year. Mid—to—high teens at best for most areas. And then, as that weather system starts to pull away during Friday evening, Friday night, there could be some really strong winds for a time, even gales, across East Anglia and the south-east as the heavy rain pulls away. But for Saturday, most places end up with a decent day. A few showers across eastern parts of Scotland and England. Elsewhere, should be dry, fairly light winds, some sunshine coming through. But again, temperatures a bit below where you might see them at this time of year. Second half of the weekend starts to turn more unsettled once again. An area of cloud and rain slowly edging in from the west means that many eastern areas will have a fine day, before the rain arrives later on in the day. But still, a bit on the cool side for many. Welcome to BBC News, broadcasting to our viewers on public television in the US and around the globe. My name’s Mike Embley. Our top stories. Greek MPs have voted in favour of reforms demanded by the country’s international creditors to help secure a new bailout. Police in Texas deny editing this video showing the arrest of Sandra Blend, 3 black woman who later died in custody. More questions are left unanswered. Do you want a pay rise with that?

And could this be the world’s oldest Koran? Fragments thought to be1400 yearsold are found on a shelf in Britain. Within the past few hours, Greek MP’s have voted to pass a package of economic reforms needed to secure a new international bailout. After a debate the lasted long into the night the bill passed with the support of 230 lawmakers in the 300 seat parliament. The result means Greece has fulfilled its side of the agreement reached in the eurozone summit this month. Our correspondent, Chris Morris, is in Athens.

They deny their initial video was edited, they blame the jumps and overlaps in it on glitches. The case of Sandra Bland is the latest to strain relations between police and African—Americans. According to the sheriff in charge of the jail where she was found hanged, she told a guard she’d previously attempted suicide. This report from the BBC’s Gary O’Donoghue. July 10, a highwayjust outside Houston, Texas, and Sandra Bland is stopped for failing to signal when changing lanes. Hello, ma’am. It starts off relatively calmly. The police officer goes back to his own car. And a few minutes later he returns, and tensions start to rise. You seem very irritated. I am, I really am. And then the real spark, over a cigarette. Do you mind putting out your cigarette, please? I am in my car, I don’t have to put out my cigarette. Well, you can step out now. I don’t have to step out. Step out of the car. No, you do not have the right to do that. I do have the right, new step out or I will remove you. As things get worse, the officer pulls a stun gun and issues a threat. Get out of the car! Get out! 1m You are doing all this for a failure to signal. Get over there. Right, yeah. Let’s take this to court. As the two moved out of the camera’s view, the argument escalates further. Afterwards, Sandra Bland is taken to Waller County Jail. Three days later, just after 9:003m onJuly 13, she was found hanging in her cell. Attempts to resuscitate her were unsuccessful. The death is now being investigated by the local district attorney, and police are facing severe criticism for apparently editing the original dashcam video. Here is one example. You see the truck driver get out of his cab and walk away, reappearing in the same position a few moments later. The Texas Department for Public Safety says there was a glitch on the video when it was uploaded and have now released a new set of footage. Meanwhile, Sandra Bland’s family says there has to be an independent autopsy to look at how she died, as they do not believe she killed herself. Sandy was pulled over for failure to indicate a proper lane change, and looking at that as her sister, I feel the officer was picking on her. Kurdish militants have claimed responsibility for killing two police officers in Turkey. They say it was retaliation for the suicide bombing in the border city of Suruc near Syria, which killed 32 young activists. Turkish officials say the bomber was a 20—year—old ethnic Kurd with links to the extremist group that calls itself Islamic State. Here’s the BBC’sJim Muir. The Turkish government has now relaxed that ban on access to Twitter after imposing it for a day or so. It has been thought that the reason for the ban was simply to prevent people disseminating pictures of that horrible bomb explosion down here in southern Turkey on Monday in which more than 32 people, or around 32, were killed in a suicide blast. Also, perhaps the government was hoping to prevent that social media being used as a way of mobilising people to take part in the demonstrations that have been happening, more of which are planned, against the government and the authorities. Demonstrators accuse the government of turning a blind eye to some of Islamic State’s activities and not doing enough to protect the Kurds. The man who carried out that attack, we are told, has been identified by DNA as a 20—year—old student from south—east Turkey. He is believed to have been Kurdish and to have had links with Islamic State and had perhaps been into Syria just across the border from here for training or indoctrination by the so—called Islamic State. After a four—year campaign to raise the minimum wage, fast food workers in New York are going to get a big pay rise. A panel appointed by the state governor, Andrew Cuomo, has recommended that pay in fast food chains should be increased from just under $9 an hour to $15. Samira Hussain has the latest from New York. This really affects only fast—food restaurants that are chains and that have a certain number of restaurants. Of course, in general, the fast—food industry is saying, ""Why are we being targeted?"" They feel they are being unfairly targeted as representative of all low—wage workers. The fact remains that in the state of New York, fast—food restaurants are the biggest employer of low—wage workers and for those low—wage workers that are making $8.75 and hour, this new move represents a boost of 70% for their wages. Four Chelsea football fans, including a man who used to be a police officer, have been banned from all matches for up to five years for their involvement in a racist incident on the Paris Metro. A fifth Chelsea supporter has already been banned for five years. Phone footage recorded in February showed a black man being shoved off a train and subjected to racist chants. There are flashing images in Daniela Relph’s report, from the start. CHANTING. Paris in February of this year. Chelsea fans in the city ahead of their Champions League game. There had been tension and disorder for much of the day. Police reported heavy drinking and drug—taking amongst fans. But it was an incident on the Paris Metro that a judge described today as having tarnished the reputation of English football in Europe. Souleymane Sylla, on his way home from work, tried to get onto a Metro carriage. Chelsea fans blocked his path and pushed him off the train. He tried again, but got the same reaction amid deeply offensive chants. We’re racist, we’re racist... Today, four of those involved were punished. Richard Barklie, 50 years old, a former police officer now working in human rights, banned forfive years for aggressive conduct. Next to him, 20-year-old joshua Parsons, whose behaviour that night was described as agitated and threatening, also banned for five years. Behind him, Jordan Munday. He got a three—year ban for contributing to unacceptable behaviour. And William Simpson — anotherfive year ban. Thejudge warned him he could not hide behind the mob. REPORTER: You’re accused of being a thug. Are you a thug, Mr Simpson? As he left court today, William Simpson was asked about his behaviour that night. He said nothing. The judge told the court that the use of CCTV and phone footage meant unacceptable behaviour was now less easy to hide in the crowd. He said the conduct of the four Chelsea fans that evening in Paris was ""nasty, arrogant and abhorrent, and could not be tolerated in a civilised society."" At home in Paris, Souleymane Sylla says the experience has been hard to forget. TRANSLATION: I’m waiting for compensation, for myself and for my family. We’ve all been so traumatised by this. Thejudge said that despite much good work, football still has a racism problem and this case had highlighted that. Daniela Relph, BBC News, Stratford. California’s Supreme Court has cleared the way for a sexual abuse lawsuit to be brought against the veteran actor and entertainer Bill Cosby. He’s facing a series of historic sexual assault allegations dating back several decades. The 78—year—old denies all the claims. Earlier I spoke to the BBC’s David Willis in Los Angeles for the latest. This is bad news for Bill Cosby. His legal team sought to overturn this civil case filed by... On behalf of a woman named Judy Huth, who claims that back in 1974 she was sexually assaulted by Bill Cosby at the Playboy mansion in Beverly Hills when she was only 15. Bill Cosby and his legal team denied that accusation. They had sought to have this case effectively dismissed, but the Californian Supreme Court has ruled against them in that case. So it appears that they can now go ahead and the lawyer for a the woman said this was, in her words, a very major victory for their side. There are of course many other allegations which Bill Cosby also denies. Does this in any way open the way for those to come to court? Potentially it does open the way for more civil cases to be filed against Bill Cosby. There are a number of other people lining up to file civil suits, accusing him of defamation. But so many of these allegations go back to the late ‘605 and ‘705 and are therefore beyond the statute of limitations, which means no criminal charges can be brought. It has been reported that the Los Angeles Police Department is investigating to see if there are any grounds for some sort of criminal case to be brought. But no indication bus for that they have decided to do so. Stay with us on BBC News, still to come. The American musical adapted for more contemporary tastes, hoping to wow younger audiences.

The latest headlines: Greek MPs have voted overwhelmingly in favour of reforms demanded by the country’s international creditors. Police in Texas have denied they edited a video showing the arrest of a black woman who later died in their custody. They blamed technical glitches for apparentjumps in the film and have released a new version of the footage. When President Obama arrives in Kenya on Friday, it will be his first trip there in almost a decade. But what has the man who made much of his Kenyan roots done or going to do for the country of one half of his family? Alastair Leithead reports from Nairobi. They consider him America’s first Kenyan President. It is one of the few places he can come and still feel a little love. For us Kenyans, he is the first black President, and he has some roots from Kenya. So I think is a good person. Headline writers might call it Obama—mania. And while the gloss has come off his presidency, his colours are still bright here in Kenya. He stumbled onto the African stage last year, more than halfway through his presidency, by bringing African leaders to America, and offering more investment in trade rather than aid. It seemed like a bit of a scramble against China’s growing influence. But, as in many places, America’s focus is on security. Arguably, this is where America’s War on Terror began. This is the site of the US embassy which was destroyed in 1998 in a bomb attack, the same day that the embassy in Dares Salaam was targeted. This is a memorialfor those who died, many of these Kenyan. President Obama will visit here as part of his trip, and it is also where the security relationship between America and Kenya began, one that has only strengthened as Al—Shabaab have been carrying out attacks outside of Somalia, here in the heart of Kenya. The assault on the Westgate Mall two years ago opened everyone’s eyes to what they were capable of. The shocking student massacre in April showed security is still lacking. Part of the Kenyan coast remains out of bounds. Talks about closer cooperation and the fight against corruption are firmly on the agenda, especially new President Kenyatta’s international criminal court case has been dropped. We have been working in very close collaboration with American agencies in ourfight against terror, and I am certain that that is an agenda that we will further strengthen during this particular meeting, strengthen our partnership, strengthen our cooperation. The last time Senator Obama visited the country of his father, he looked somewhat younger. A trip to his home town was unlikely, but his uncle thinks there is plenty of time for that. I believe he is going to be more helpful to this place while out of office than when he stayed in the office, because right now there are quite a lot of constraints attached. We know about his family’s past, but what about his future? what is and what will be the African lagacy of America’s first black president? With President Bush, President Clinton, we actually felt an immediate change. Perhapsjudging, you know, Obama’s legacy and impact is going to need a bit more time. We start to look at trade figures over time. Marks out of ten? I would say five out of ten. That doesn’t sound very much. No, no, no, but I would also give a caveat that you need a bit of time. It is too early to assess. Concreting over the cracks, short—term visits are fine for a fleeting visit. But Kenya need something more solid to build on. Growing trade, investment and investing in the causes of insecurity, rather than just a quick fix, is what President Obama can help deliver. What may be the world’s oldest fragments of the Koran have been found at a British university. They have been carbon—dated to the seventh century. Researchers in Birmingham believe the person who wrote them could have met the Prophet Mohamed. Nick Higham has more. It is just a fragment, but it is written using an early form of Arabic script, and the words are from the Koran. They are written on sheep or goat skin parchment, and that parchment has been radiocarbon dated to the year 645, at the latest. It could be even older. The Prophet Muhammad died in 632. If the dating of our Koran is correct, then the person who actually wrote it may well have known the Prophet Muhammad. He would have seen him, probably. He would maybe have heard him preach in Medina. He may have known him personally, and that really is quite a thought to conjure with. Muslims believe the Koran was dictated by Muhammad, and then memorised and written down, unchanged, by his immediate followers. But some Western academics think it must have evolved over many years, like the Christian Bible and theJewish Torah. This discovery is significant because it suggests the traditional Muslim account might in fact be correct. The text may indeed have been settled during the Prophet’s own lifetime. For Birmingham’s Muslim community, one of the largest in the country, it is a remarkable and emotional discovery. Myself, when I saw these pages, I was very much moved. And there were tears ofjoy and emotions in my eyes, because we’d never thought that we would have such an old copy of our holy book. I think, as a news story, it’s very good because Muslims are constantly in the headlines for the wrong reasons. The fact that they have some kind of validation for their religious tradition and the history of that tradition is important for themselves, in terms of self identity, and also it gives pride to the Muslim community as well that they have something they can reflect upon and perhaps talk to people about. And it is in Birmingham thanks to a member of the wealthy Cadbury family in the city, who bankrolled a collector of ancient manuscripts in the 19205. Nick Higham, BBC News. Ben Platt is probably best known as one of the stars of Pitch Perfect, 3 Hollywood hit that has helped create a new generation of music lovers. He is now the lead in Deer Evan Hansen, 3 production that is getting its world premiere in Washington. Jane O’Brien looks at how the musicalform is being adapted to suit the audiences of today. Evan Hansen is a social misfit. Just because, you know, you said it, and I repeated it, and it is so annoying when people do that. Real relationships are a struggle, and when a classmate dies, Evan writes a letter that leads the grieving parents to think he is their son’s best friend. It’s a musical written for an audience more familiar perhaps with the TV musical drama Glee than with Oklahoma. 18—year—old Evan is played by 21—year—old Ben Platt, star of the box office musical hit Pitch Perfect. If you have modern characters in a contemporary musical, singing in a way that contemporary people can understand and relate to, it feels very authentic. And so I think musicals, the reason they don’t feel outdated or silly to kids my age is because they have adapted to the times. Musicals are a quintessential American art form. They are subversive, sugarcoating complex issues with singalong lyrics. Dear Evan Hansen is no different, exploring teenage angst and the impact of social media. Even though we are a very connected society, we may actually not be that connected in terms of true human connection. So when there’s something like a tragedy happens, or a loss in the community happens, suddenly it galvanises everyone to come together, and that’s a good but a complicated thing. Is it a good thing? Those are the things Dear Evan Hansen talks about. Aged 30, Benj and Justin already have Broadway credits. The music is poppy, with choruses anyone can sing, even me. Yeah, nice! Despite its upbeat tempo and zest, this particular song is actually about isolation, in a world shared online. And the rhythms and speech patterns of Dear Evan Hansen attempt to reflect that hyper—connectivity throughout the musical. 50, Broadway next. Ithink so! Because issues have changed, maybe we have the perception that the musical has changed. But I think that it’s still functioning in a similar way, I think it’s taking on contemporary issues, and I think that the sound of the music is now reflecting more modern sound, and we’ve piovted to try to make it more accessible to a modern audience. As the plot unfolds, audiences may find themselves wishing Evan, like many teenagers, would make different choices, but as long as he keeps singing, they will probably forgive him.

The forecast for Friday is giving us a few headaches at the moment. Shorter—term, it’s a little more more straightforward. We’ve got an area of low pressure sitting to the north of the UK, bringing some breezy weather to northern parts. Fairly quiet and settled further south, but it’s this low pressure system that’s the problem for Friday. Just determining exactly how far north it’s going to come. But as I say, in the shorter term for Thursday, a largely dry day across much of England and Wales. Starting the day with just maybe one or two light showers across the south—west, but sunny spells elsewhere. After a bit of a cool, fresh start, temperatures getting up quite quickly into the midteens fairty widely. Some patchy cloud drifting through on those fairly light west to south—westerly breezes. The breeze much more noticeable, though, as you go into Northern Ireland, northernmost counties of England and particularly Scotland, where those winds will be rattling a few showers through. aswell. Some will be on the heavy side. Probably not too many showers getting across the eastern side of the Grampians. Little change, really, through the rest of the day. Still a scattering of showers for Scotland, perhaps Northern Ireland. Any showers across England and Wales very few and far between. 50 most places miss them and stay dry. With relatively light winds, feeling reasonably warm in the sunshine in England and Wales. Wales. That breeze, though, really quite a cool edge to it in a good part of Scotland and Northern Ireland. But then, as I say, Friday is a bit of a problem, and it is all down to this area of low pressure. A lot of uncertainty as to just how far north it’s going to come. Best estimate at the moment is that the heaviest rain looks most likely to be across southern parts of England and Wales, but it is possible the leading edge of that rain could get up to, well, north Wales, perhaps the Manchester area, and across much of the Midlands. So this is how we see things most likely at the moment. But as I say, there’s that uncertainty as you go further north. More certain about the forecast for Scotland, Northern Ireland. Here, a scattering of showers, but many places staying dry, relatively light winds. Temperatures generally still below the average for the time of year. Mid—to—high teens at best for most areas. And then, as that weather system starts to pull away during Friday evening, Friday night, there could be some really strong winds for a time, even gales perhaps coming in across East Anglia and the south—east as the heavy rain pulls away. But for Saturday, most places end up with a decent day. A few showers across eastern parts of Scotland and England. Elsewhere, should be dry, fairly light winds, some sunshine coming through. But again, temperatures a bit below where you might normally expect to see them at this time of year. Second half of the weekend starts to turn more unsettled once again. An area of cloud and rain slowly edging in from the west means that many eastern areas will have a fine day, before the rain arrives later on in the day. But still, a bit on the cool side for many. The headlines. Greek MPs have voted to pass a second package of reforms, needed to secure a third international bailout. The bill making changes to thejudicial and banking system, passed easily. The result means Greece has fulfilled its side of the agreement reached in the eurozone summit this month and negotiations for a third bailout can now begin. Police in Texas have denied they edited a video showing the arrest of a black woman who later died in their custody. They blame technical glitches. The case of Sandra Bland is the latest to strain relations between police and African—Americans. The sheriff in charge of the jail where she was found hanged has claimed she told a guard she’d previously attempted suicide. Fast food workers in New York have won a 70% pay increase after a four—year campaign to raise the minimum wage. It means pay rates should rise from $9 an hour to $15. Now it is time for Panorama. Jerusalem — an ancient city with a sparkling new train. It was meant to help unite this place, but the train is dividing it further. TRANSLATION: I don’t think they put the train here to serve the Palestinians. Now it’s easier forJews to travel into Palestinian suburbs. Before this station, 10,000 to 20,000 Jews were going to this neighbourhood in a month. Today, in one day, we’re talking about the same amount. The Palestinians would rather they stayed away. Thank you very much. And the train itself has become a target for violence. TRANSLATION: They burned everything belonging to the train. I’m Adam Wishart, a BritishJew, and I’m going to rideJerusalem’s new train and journey into the heart of a city that feels more divided than ever. I’m boarding theJerusalem Light Rail at the start, Mount Herzl. When I was first here on a Zionist education course as a teenager, they didn’t have such things. Now, this new $1 billion line serves a city of about 800,000 people. 60% arejewish. We are building a network of public transportation in the city ofJerusalem. We have the first line, the red line, and we will be building an additional three lines in the next decade. The philosophy is to enable high—end public transport for all people, Muslims Christians and Jews, residents and visitors, it’s open for all, and enable people to feel freedom. The rail line isjust nine miles from start to finish. Most of it is in Jewish WestJerusalem. My first stop is Damascus Gate, entrance to the old city and a world divided by religious rivalry. Walk through here and you’ll find one of the holiest sites for Muslims — home to the Dome of the Rock, the Al—Aqsa mosque and the courtyard that joins them. They’re all under Muslim control. This woman’s here to pray and keep a watchful eye. This is my second home, basically. If I don’t come here, Ifeel there is something missing. Why is it so important to you? It is a place where our Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon Him, ascended into the sky, to heaven. This is one of our most holy sites. It is also home to the holiest site inJudaism, a Jewish temple destroyed here 2000 years ago. All that remains is the Western Wall of the courtyard, the Wailing Wall where Jews come to pray. Some want to completely rebuild the temple on what they called Temple Mount. No matter that Muslim holy places are already here. The goal is building a mutual house for the God of Israel. So I have to do my best to build a third Temple on Temple Mount. This is the prophecy and it is coming near. Rivka Shimon is part of the new Temple Movement, determined to stake a claim for theJews. And she sees the train as a way of doing it. They think it is good for the future, that many pilgrims will come and from every age ofJerusalem they can all go to Temple Mount very easily in a convenient way. And it’s a good invention for Jerusalem, I think. Once, Jews only ever came as far as the Western Wall. Now, 1,000 Jews 3 month enter the courtyard, the heart of this Muslim place of worship. Rivka, who is leading a tour, believes she has a right to be here. Within minutes of her group arriving, there is protest. This is our place of worship, they should at least respect that. They come in and they invade. They walk around and they do pray, in silence, which they shouldn’t be doing in there. She’s right. Jews are allowed to visit, but not prey on this site, as part of an agreement between the two sides. While I’m walking and talking, I’m asking, please be merciful to us. But you aren’t really allowed to prey on the Temple Mount? This is a prayer and they know it. It is a prayer. When you talk to yourself, it’s not yourself, you are talking to God. Today’s skirmish is part of growing hostility fuelled by the competing claims ofJews and Muslims to this holy place. It has already escalated into serious violence. Last November, a group of Temple Movement visitors were attacked by Palestinians. In response, police entered the Al—Aqsa mosque. It may only have been by a few metres, but for many Muslims it crossed a sacred line. When we are brave enough and when we are sure enough that what we are doing is right, no one can be against us and God will help us. When we are brave enough and when we are sure enough that what we are doing is right, no one can be against us and God will help us. And it will come. And it will be good for the Muslim world not to be against us because, if they will be against us, they will suffer. In the face of growing tension, the Israeli government has repeatedly said it has no plans to allowJews to pray there. The State of Israel declared itself an independent nation in 19A8. My grandparents, amongst many, were jubilant as they had campaigned for it. Back then, Israel only held the western part ofJerusalem, up to the so—called Green Line. Then, in 1967, Israel occupied the eastern areas. That’s where the train is heading now. The Palestinians who live here remain angry at being under Israeli control. The train just adds to their grievances. TRANSLATION: I’m standing on my land that serves Israelis instead of serving me. I feel as if they put a rock on my chest. Everyday the train passes, they are butchering me. Every day they are killing me. This is what the train means to us. Whalid Abou Khedir is showing me what used to be his land until it was taken to build this train station. He refused compensation because the taking of land fits into a broader picture. Since 19.57, Israel has seized around 6,000 acres of land in eastJerusalem. whalid has lost about ten acres in total. TRANSLATION: It is forbidden for us to use these lands for security inf-1M We don’t know what they mean by that. And why they confiscated the lands, we don’t know. I live in a very depressing situation. My land is here and yet I can’t build a house for my son. I can’t even build a bigger house for myself to breathe and feel like a normal human being. I have all this land, but I cannot build a single room. When I was first here more than 30 years ago, I was afraid to go to these eastern Palestinian suburbs. Today, the train seems to have eroded the unease thatJews once felt. It is helping to strengthen the Jewish presence in neighbourhoods thatJews never passed through. Before this train was operating, I believe maybe 10,000 to 20,000 Jews were going to this neighbourhood in a month. Today, in one day, we are talking about the same amount — in one day. Arieh King is a local politician and a property developer with a difference. He is going to show me his latest project, buying up bits of land in Palestinian neighbourhoods. So this is a property that we have living here a few people. It’s one of the biggest neighbourhoods in eastJerusalem. Today, besides here, we have four apartments here. We have another complex with seven apartments and if we continue on this road, we have another area with more apartments and one with four apartments. I am trying to create layers of Jewish rings around the heart of the Jewish nation, this is Temple Mount. Not big pieces yet, but the plan is to have a big neighbourhood. Arieh is showing a group of Israelis around, hoping they will buy into his vision ofJewish expansion into Palestinian areas. But his grand plan to buy up [and and to use the courts to evict Palestinians from houses he claims Jews once owned is met with local resistance. Thank you very much. He is a squatter. I believe in a year or two, he will not be here and there will bejews inside. Arieh King is clear why he is doing this, to tighten Israel’s grip across the whole city, leaving no room for a Palestinian state which includes any part of jerusalam. I don’t know today one person who thinks there is really a chance for any kind of agreement inJerusalem. Everybody admits there is no chance, there is no way to divide this city. There is no way, forget it. It is not going to happen. And the Palestinians see the train as part of this ultimate Israeli plan, to make their control of the city irrevocable. TRANSLATION: I don’t think they put the train here to serve the Palestinians, there is no train to our refugee camp. Baha Nabata is a youth worker. He gets off at the El Sahl station, a 20 minute walk from where he lives, the largest Palestinian neighbourhood within the city limits, the Shuafat refugee camp and its surrounding areas. Behind a 2k foot barrier are the homes of tens of thousands of Palestinians. The only way in and out of the camp from the city is this one checkpoint. Here, the city changes from a modern metropolis to a slum. This is my first time here. On my teenage Zionist education course, they didn’t introduce us to any Palestinians. TRANSLATION: As you can see, this place is not a safe environment. Nobody picks up the rubbish and the streets are not paved. You will see strange things here because of the pressure and population density. Children dropping out of school, drugs — it’s because of the wall, the municipality, the occupation and the policies of the Israeli government. You can’t breathe here. If you look over there to theJewish side, it is green, full of trees. Both neighbourhoods belong to the municipality but they don’t give services to the Palestinians. Israel says the barrier that surrounds this part of the city was built to protect Israelis from attack. But it seems to me it serves another purpose as well, to cordon off the squalor and deprivation. I was in Shuafat refugee camp, and it’s part of the municipality. There’s rubbish all over the streets. There’s sporadic water. I want to share something with you, when you talk about refugees. There are noJewish refugees in the world, not one. If we find them, we bring them and take them home and help them. It’s very unfortunate that there are Arab refugees. All the wealth of the Arab world, they haven’t found the time and the capital to help the refugees out. The world has to understand that you can throw a few billions of dollars to the problem and find them good homes, not on the account of Israel. The mayor’s response shocks me. The neighbourhood might be called a refugee camp, but the people who live here are residents ofJerusalem and he is the city’s mayor. Therre residents of jerusalem, aren’t they? I agree with you. I do everything I can. However, it’s a problem that the municipality cannot solve on its own. The municipality says it’s spending more every year and would like to provide even more services, but its staff are subject to physical and verbal abuse. I can’t help feeling that the state of this place and the lawlessness, all enclosed by the barrier, make this part ofJerusalem a tinderbox waiting to ignite. TRANSLATION: It’s difficult to be a child, born into an environment of occupation and racism. It leads to a negative situation. Nobody born a violent person. —— Nobody’s born a violent person. But the segregation and disparities lead to war and violence. The next generation are already arming themselves with whatever they can get their hands on. Do you think throwing stones can beat the Israelis? But aren’t you afraid? Just as we’re leaving the camp, there’s an attack on the guards at the checkpoint. It turns out that most of the noise comes from fireworks, the ammunition of the powerless. It soon ends when the border police fire tear gas. In the last year, these violent incidents have spilled into the rest of the city and escalated into murder. Palestinians have targeted the rail line, driving cars into waiting passengers, killing three adults and a baby. 16—year—old Palestinian Mohammed Abou Khedir was also walking by the train line a year ago, when he was kidnapped by a group of Israelis. As tension grew in the mn up to last summer’s Gan war, three Israeli teenagers had also been abducted and murdered. Hussein is Mohammed’s father. TRANSLATION: Mohammed was here, he was standing right here. Two of them pulled up in the car, they opened the doors and threw him in. They took him from here to Deir Yassin. They tied him to a tree, poured petrol on him and burned him alive. It was the ugliest crime in history. TRANSLATION: Until today, I don’t believe Mohammed has gone and left me. Even now, I think he will be back. I can’t believe my son has left me. He was very special to me. The train station near where Mohammed was abducted became a target for Palestinian anger. They destroyed it. TRANSLATION: For 15 days the train was stopped. They prevented it from operating. The youth burned everything. Everything to do with the train was destroyed. This is a racist train to keep Jerusalem for theJews only. NEWS VOICE—OVER: The number of people killed in an armed assault on a synagogue inJerusalem has risen to five. A paramedic described what he saw as ""butcherr. At the other end of the line in Jewish West Jerusalem, residents like Risa Rothman have been touched by the violence too. What happened to my husband is that he was sliced across the head, through the eye, he was sliced twice across the head. They cut him through the bone and several times along the arm. They used a kind...like a cleaver, like a meat cleaver. The tack did not kill Mr Rothman. -- The attack did not kill Mr Rothman. He’s been in a come for the last eight months. Good morning, how are you? PRAYING. The attack happened at the synagogue where he used to pray and study every day. I don’t know why they chose this one. I actually do think that they specifically did choose one that was away from the centre to give over the message that ""No, we’re not ""attacking only the people that are over the Green Line or near it, ""whatever, that noJew in any synagogue in Israel is really safe."" I did not stop crying for the first two days. I didn’tjust cry because of what happened to me. But I cried because how could such a horror happen? How could people come into a place that’s so peaceful... Such horrific violent act. I’m back in the heart of the city and it’sJerusalem Day, a celebration of Israel’s 1967 capture of EastJerusalem and the old city. The Six Days War was a miraculous war. Even though all the Arab countries claimed that they were going to murder us, we won and where are we marching? To the direction of Temple Mount. Youth worker Baha Nabata is here too to protest. For Palestinians, Jerusalem Day marks the beginning of the occupation. As thousands of Israelis march through the Muslim quarter, there is predictably heated protest. Jerusalem Day degenerates into hateful chanting on both sides. At the end of the day, the march arrives at the Western Wall, which borders the Muslim holy sites, where Arieh and others want to rebuild their Temple. At the end of the day, the march arrives at the Western Wall, which borders the Muslim holy sites, where Arieh and others want to rebuild their Temple. No words, no. Look what happiness. Our future is better than our present. You see the youngsters, the youth, what happiness just to go to the only well that remains of the temple. Imagine what will happen when we have a temple. When I was here 31 years ago, even my most fervently Zionist friends weren’t rushing to build a temple on this site. Now the idea is gathering support from within the mainstream. Even a member of the new cabinet supports the idea. I can’t help but think if somejews push much further this would surely be the [and stand for the Palestinians. I’m left wondering what is the purpose of the train? Does its ultimate destination hold a due? It travels north through the Palestinian neighbourhoods and snakes round the refugee camp. What’s so controversial is that the ultimate destination is an Israeli settlement, 1,000 acres taken by Israel to build a beautiful suburb. Like all settlements in occupied territory, most of the international community considers them to be illegal. I don’t get it. In all those place there’s was never a Palestinian state. —— In all those place there was never a Palestinian state. Put a shovel in the ground, and you’ll find Jewish roots. So, when people talk about occupied land, occupied from whom? It’s allJewish. The train makes permanent the expansion of Israel. This settlement is built like a fortress, perhaps not surprising when so many Israelis feel a constant threat from their Arab neighbours. It’s Rivka Shimon’s home. I came here 12 years ago, relatively to a new neighbourhood, because it was all empty, you know, before the Six Days War. It’s very big neighbourhood. It’s like, I think new 70,000 people. It’s like a city, in fact. I like the view, because before I lived in a very crowded place and I didn’t see no sky, no trees, no view. So I love the place. What’s remarkable about this settlement, with all its amenities, is that it’s only a few hundred yards from the squalor and deprivation of the Palestinian area, including the Shuafat refugee camp, the other side of the barrier. Have you ever been over there? No, of course not. No. Even the police don’t go there. As the crow flies, the Israelis and Palestinians should be neighbours, but they’re separated by an ever—widening gulf of distrust. TRANSLATION: There will never be peace between us and the Israelis, the Jews, or the municipality. How could they be human beings? The settlers have lived opposite us and see with their own eyes the conditions of the camp and the situation we’re in. It is in no way humane or normal. Myjourney has been heart breaking. When my grandparents campaigned for the state of Israel, they hoped for a place of refugee, of tolerance and equal rights for all. As I take the last train, Ijust can’t believe this could be the place that they dreamt of all those years ago. Hello, you’re watching BBC World News. I’m Adnan Nawaz.

Another revolt from within the main mling party has not stopped the Greek parliament approving a second set of demands from the country’s creditors. The latest reforms are more structural than purely financial, but their implementation will allow Prime Minister Tsipras to begin negotiating the details of a new 86 billion euro bailout. Our Europe correspondent Chris Morris reports from Athens. Outside Parliament, they marched against yet more unpopular measures, more demands from this country’s creditors. But they could not stop the approval of sweeping reforms to Greece’s judicial system. Or the formal adoption of eurozone rules in dealing with failing banks. A brief interruption, direct action, but nothing serious. And the attention moved inside the Parliamentary chamber. It was a marathon debate, stretching almost until dawn. More than 30 MP5 from the main governing party Syriza voted no. But crucially, the number of rebels were so the lower than last week. The Prime Minister admitted he did not really approve of most of the deal being imposed upon him. But he was unrepentant. TRANSLATION: We will not be cowed. We will not surrender. We will not apologise for lost battles. Lost battles are ones which were never fought in the first place. We will plant a seed which will grow. Many opposition MPs voted in favour, not to support the government, they said, but to safeguard the future of the country. A bitter pill for all to swallow. The Greeks know that this will be a difficult time. But they are ready to accept what measures have to be taken, so that they can be sure their way and their future. But it all means that formal negotiations on a third bailout for Greece can now begin. The timetable is now tight. There is little room to manoeuvre. So 970 pages of legislation, only a few hours of debate. It is not how parliamentary democracy is supposed to work. But Alexis Tsipras says the deal he did with other eurozone leaders is the only way he could keep Greece within the single currency. And despite the resentment inside and outside Parliament, Mr Tsipras remains by far the most popular politician in the country. Will he new head for early elections? We will know soon enough.

Where thousands of fast food workers are to get a major pay rise, following a four—year campaign to raise the minimum wage. Late on Wednesday, a panel appointed by New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo voted unanimously for what amounts to a 70% rise in fast food pay over the next three years. Let’s take a quick look at the numbers. Fast food workers in New York City will get a minimum of $15 an hour by the end of 2018. By 2021, that will extend to the rest of the state. That compares with the current state minimum of $8.75 According to the Fiscal Policy Institute, 60% of New York’s fast food workers rely on some form of benefit to supplement earnings. The move is a big blow to McDonalds, which tried to head off criticism with a promise to raise its minimum wage to $10 an hour for staff at its own restaurants. One New York—based McDonalds franchisee said it is unfair and discriminatory to single out the fast food business, when some healthcare and childcare workers also make less than $15 an hour. US cities including Los Angeles, Seattle and San Francisco have all announced big rises in the minimum wage, after waves of protest by fast food workers.

Gabriel Gatehouse, reporting from Ukraine. California’s Supreme Court has cleared the way for a sex abuse lawsuit to be brought against the American actor Bill Cosby. The civil case accuses 78—year—old Mr Cosby of sexually assaulting a 15—year—old girl at the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles in the 19705. He denies the charge, and the court rejected his application to review the case. From LA, here is David Willis. His legal team sought to overturn this civil case filed by... On behalf of a woman named Judy Huth, who claims that back in 1974 that she was sexually assaulted by Bill Cosby at the Playboy mansion in Beverly Hills when she was just 15 years old. Now, Bill Cosby and his legal team deny that accusation. They had sought to have this case effectively dismissed, but the California Supreme Court has ruled against them in that case. So it does appear that they can now go ahead, and the lawyer for Miss Huth said this was, in her words, a very major victory for their side. There are a number of other people lining up to file civil suits, accusing him of defamation. But so many of these allegations go back so far, to the late ‘605 and earty “705, and are therefore beyond the stamte of limitations, which means no criminal charges can be brought. It has been reported here that the Los Angeles Police Department is investigating to see if there are any grounds, potentially, for some sort of criminal case to be brought, but no indication thus far that they have decided to do so.

Police in Texas investigating the death of a black woman in their custody have released a revised version of the video that shows what happenned during her arrest. They deny their initial video was edited and blame anyjumps and overlaps on technical glitches. The Sheriff in charge of the jail where Sandra Bland was found hanging in her cell says she told a guard she had previously attempted suicide. Her family denies she was depressed. Gary O’Donoghue reports from Washington. July 10, a highwayjust outside Houston, Texas, and Sandra Bland is stopped for failing to signal when changing lanes. Hello, ma’am. It starts off relatively calmly. The police officer goes back to his own car. And a few minutes later he returns, and tensions start to rise. You seem very irritated. I am, I really am. And then the real spark, over a cigarette. Do you mind putting out your cigarette, please? I am in my car, I don’t have to put out my cigarette. Well, you can step out now. I don’t have to step out. Step out of the car. No, you do not have the right to do that. I do have the right, new step out or I will remove you. As things get worse, the officer pulls a stun gun and issues a threat. Get out of the car! Get out! 1m I will light you up! Get out! You are doing all this for a failure to signal. Get over there. Right, yeah. Let’s take this to court. As the two moved out of the camera’s view, the argument escalates further. Afterwards, Sandra Bland is taken to Waller County Jail. Three days later, just after 9:003m onJuly 13, she was found hanging in her cell. Attempts to resuscitate her were unsuccessful. The death is now being investigated by the local district attorney, and police are facing severe criticism for apparently editing the original dashcam video. Here is one example. You see the truck driver get out of his cab and walk away, reappearing in the same position a few moments later. The Texas Department for Public Safety says there was a glitch on the video when it was uploaded and have now released a new set of footage. Meanwhile, Sandra Bland’s family says there has to be an independent autopsy to look at how she died, as they do not believe she killed herself. Sandy was pulled over for failure to indicate a proper lane change, and looking at that as her sister, I feel the officer was picking on her.

Plus, life after sanctions. The global auto industry gears up for a massive new market, in Iran. Welcome to World Business Report. I’m Caroline Hepker. More on Iran in a moment. But first: We start in New York, where thousands of fast food workers are to get a major pay rise, following a four—year campaign to raise the minimum wage. Late on Wednesday, a panel appointed by New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo voted unanimously for what amounts to 70% rise in fast food pay over the next three years. Let’s take a quick look at the numbers. Fast food workers in New York City will get a minimum of $15 an hour by the end of 2018. By 2021 that will extend to the rest of the state. That compares with the current state minimum of $8.75 According to the Fiscal Policy Institute, 60% of New York’s fast food workers rely on some form of benefit to supplement earnings. The move is a big blow to McDonalds, which tried to head off criticism with a promise to raise its minimum wage to $10 an hour for staff at its own restaurants. One New York—based McDonalds franchisee said it is unfair and discriminatory to single out the fast food business, when some healthcare and childcare workers also make less than $15 an hour. US cities including Los Angeles, Seattle and San Francisco have all announced big rises in the minimum wage, after waves of protest by fast food workers. From New York, Samira Hussein reports. The fast food industry is one of the largest employers of low—wage largest employers of low—wage workers in the State of New York. workers in the State of New York. Some 200,000 people.

By 2018, fast food workers in New By 2018, fast food workers in New York city should see their wages go York city should see their wages go “P York city should see their wages go up to $15 an hour. The rest of the up to $15 an hour. The rest of the state should follow by 2020. Now, state should follow by 2020. Now, this will only affect restaurants this will only affect restaurants that have 30 or more locations. New that have 30 or more locations. New York is the biggest city in America, York is the biggest city in America, and one of the largest states in the and one of the largest states in the country. Many are wondering if this country. Many are wondering if this news could be a sea change moment news could be a sea change moment for the American workforce. Well, Kevin Poulter is legal director, BDB. if: Hejoins me this morning to talk He joins me this morning to talk about Hejoins me this morning to talk about this. So let’s kick things about this. So let’s kick things off. It was some of the restaurant off. It was some of the restaurant owners are saying that they owners are saying that they will consider legal action because of consider legal action because of this increase in the minimum wage. this increase in the minimum wage. What this increase in the minimum wage. what is this increase in the minimum wage. What is the likelihood that that what is the likelihood that that might What is the likelihood that that might succeed? This is not actually might succeed? This is not actually a legislative change, it is being a legislative change, it is being done through an order introduced by done through an order introduced by a panel which was only brought about a panel which was only brought about in May this year by the Governor, in May this year by the Governor, who is looking at alternative ways who is looking at alternative ways to push through the minimum wage to push through the minimum wage agenda in New York, which all other agenda in New York, which all other opportunities have failed. So opportunities have failed. So whether there is a legal right here whether there is a legal right here to make this sort of protest is yet to make this sort of protest is yet to be seen. What is interesting to be seen. what is interesting though is to be seen. What is interesting though is that this is specific to though is that this is specific to fast food workers, which was the fast food workers, which was the intention of the board in the first intention of the board in the first place. Hopefully the desire is this place. Hopefully the desire is this will impact on other industries as will impact on other industries as and when that comes more competition and when that comes more competition around New York, especially in New around New York, especially in New York city, obviously, where tourism York city, obviously, where tourism is such a huge industry, and that is such a huge industry, and that impact directly on the fast food. impact directly on the fast food. Now, what about McDonald’s and Now, what about McDonald’s and customers, it was at the end of the customers, it was at the end of the day is just going to be a more day is just going to be a more expensive burger? Are they going to expensive burger? Are they going to pass on the cost of higher wages to pass on the cost of higher wages to us? That is the threat, isn’t it? We us? That is the threat, isn’t it? We have already heard that McDonald’s have already heard that McDonald’s have proposed to increase wages for have proposed to increase wages for its own workers. Also their its own workers. Also their franchisees, McDonald’s sets franchisees, McDonald’s sets costings for the foodstuffs, it costings for the foodstuffs, it doesn’t Neser —— necessarily set doesn’t Neser -- necessarily set wages. Change doesn’t Neser —— necessarily set wages. Change will affect all in wages. Change will affect all in initially, New York, but eventually initially, New York, but eventually New York State. Those who have New York State. Those who have restaurants of 30 or more, does that restaurants of 30 or more, does that include franchisees or does that include franchisees or does that mean McDonald’s restaurants, or mean McDonald’s restaurants, or indeed any restaurant with 30 or indeed any restaurant with 30 or more establishments across the more establishments across the country? It will also obviously take country? It will also obviously take a little bit of time to implement, a little bit of time to implement, some years to come. Just one word on some years to come. just one word on the other some years to come. Just one word on the other side of the argument in the other side of the argument in support of this higher minimum wage, support of this higher minimum wage, which is that the government or the which is that the government or the state is giving support, actually, state is giving support, actually, the big this is because so many the big this is because so many employees have to gain welfare to employees have to gain welfare to subsidise their wages —— big subsidise their wages —— big business. So many rely on these business. So many rely on these benefits which are being subsidised benefits which are being subsidised by the taxpayer so there is a by the taxpayer so there is a movement to say actually, pay what movement to say actually, pay what is due and when the McDonald’s CEO is due and when the McDonald’s CEO is making $7.5 million each year, is making $7.5 million each year, there is a good argument to say that there is a good argument to say that splashed some of that around. Thank splashed some of that around. Thank you so much for splashed some of that around. Thank you so much forjoining us.

So for the western quality cars. So for the western European rar quality cars. So for the western European car manufacturers who can European rar manufacturers who ran get in there, the European car manufacturers who can get in there, the eventual winners get in there, the eventual winners are huge.

But if you are spending more than you are bringing in, what more than you are bringing in, what you are borrowing for is to pay the you are borrowing for is to pay the cost of your borrowing. That’s the cost of your borrowing. That’s the issue because that is to pay the issue because that is to pay the cost of your borrowing. That’s the cost of your borrowing. That’s the issue because if you’re borrowing issue because if you’re borrowing cheaply and you can pay it out of cheaply and you can pay it out of cheaply and you ran pay it out of your rash cheaply and you can pay it out of your cash flow, but that’s not your rash ﬂow, but that’s not what’s your cash flow, but that’s not what’s happening.

You know Dubai and Gulf News reported that Dubai and Gulf News reported that the UAE will scrap its fuel the UAE will scrap its fuel subsidies. Why would they do this subsidies. why would they do this and will subsidies. Why would they do this and will it be significant in terms and will it be significant in terms of stopping people from driving of stopping peopla from driving their of stopping people from driving their cars? I read this and it is their cars? I read this and it is almost Orwellian. A government almost Orwellian. A government minister speaks about the economy in minister speaks about the economy in a way that is definitely protesting a way that is definitely protesting too much. He says it is nothing to too much. He says it is nothing to do with the price of oil, which is do with the price of oil, which is down by about 40% —50%. He says it down by about 4096 -50%.

But the issue is that once number. But the issue is that once you start down this route then you start down this route then things would get quite nasty and the things would get quite nasty and the point is that the lawyers in point is that the lawyers in question are defending the rights of question are defending the rights of people and they are being told that people and they are being told that they are attacking the Communist they are attacking the Communist Party in doing that. I don’t think Party in doing that.

The forecast for Friday is giving us a few headaches at the moment. Shorter—term, it’s a little more more straightforward. We’ve got an area of low pressure sitting to the north of the UK, bringing some breezy weather to northern parts. Fairly quiet and settled further south, but it’s this low pressure system that’s the problem for Friday. Just determining exactly how far north it’s going to come. But as I say, in the shorter term for Thursday, a largely dry day across much of England and Wales. Starting the day with just maybe one or two light showers across the south—west, but sunny spells elsewhere. After a bit of a cool, fresh start, temperatures getting up quite quickly into the midteens fairty widely. Some patchy cloud drifting through on those fairly light west to south—westerly breezes. The breeze much more noticeable, though, as you go into Northern Ireland, northernmost counties of England and particularly Scotland, where those winds will be rattling a few showers through aswell. Some will be on the heavy side. Probably not too many showers getting across the eastern side of the Grampians. Little change, really, through the rest of the day. Still a scattering of showers for Scotland, perhaps Northern Ireland. Any showers across England and Wales very few and far between. 50 most places miss them and stay dry. With relatively light winds, feeling reasonably warm in the sunshine across England and Wales. That breeze, though, really quite a cool edge to it in a good part of Scotland and Northern Ireland. But then, as I say, Friday is a bit of a problem, and it is all down to this area of low pressure. A lot of uncertainty as to just how far north it’s going to come. Best estimate at the moment is that the heaviest rain looks most likely to be across southern parts of England and Wales, but it is possible the leading edge of that rain could get up to, well, north Wales, perhaps the Manchester area, and across much of the Midlands. So this is how we see things most likely at the moment. But as I say, there’s that uncertainty as you go further north. More certain about the forecast for Scotland, Northern Ireland. Here, a scattering of showers, but many places staying dry, relatively light winds. Temperatures generally still below the average for the time of year. Mid—to—high teens at best for most areas. And then, as that weather system starts to pull away during Friday evening, Friday night, there could be some really strong winds for a time, even gales perhaps coming in across East Anglia and the south—east as the heavy rain pulls away. But for Saturday, most places end up with a decent day. A few showers across eastern parts of Scotland and England. Elsewhere, should be dry, fairly light winds, some sunshine coming through. But again, temperatures a bit below where you might normally expect to see them at this time of year. Second half of the weekend starts to turn more unsettled once again. An area of cloud and rain slowly edging in from the west means that many eastern areas will have a fine day, before the rain arrives later on in the day. But still, a bit on the cool side for many.

Also today, a postmortem is due to be carried out on the hospital behind me. Even before the results of the investigation here are clear, details have been emerging about the events leading up to her death. With the children gone, it is divers who surround the lake. The grim investigation at odds with the quiet, pretty beach. One eyewitness told French television that a handful of children had already been playing on the pontoon when the school party arrived. The 20 British peoples climbed on the pontoon together and it tipped over. A lifeguard found jess unconscious in the water. It reportedly took 20 minutes to revive her before she was airlifted to hospital. We took all necessary measures to make the beach safe or swimming. An enquiry will look at the causes. I hope we have not made the mistake was that would be very serious.

The boy, who can’t be named for legal reasons, admitted encouraging an attack on police officers in Australia at an Anzac Day parade in April. The attack never took place. Our correspondent, Angus Crawford, is at the Old Bailey. This boy was just 14 when he was arrested earlier this year. Today he appeared in court at the Old Bailey via video link from Manchester Crown Court. He pleaded guilty to one charge of inciting terrorism abroad. The prosecution said that in a ten day period in March of this year, he sent literally thousands of messages, instant messages, to an 18-year-old man in Australia. Both of them inspired by so-called Islamic State he encouraged this man to attack police at an Anzac Day parade in Melbourne. In one of the 15-year-old boy, who appeared in court today said, I suggest you break into someone’s house and get your first taste of beheading. The battle for the Labour leadership got personal this morning with the former Deputy Prime Minister, Lord Prescott, attacking Tony Blair for saying that anyone whose political heart was with the left-winger, jeremy Corbyn, should ""get a transplant"". Lord Prescott said the former Prime Minister’s remark was ""absolutely staggering"" and ""totally unacce ptable| He said rival campaigns should stop abusing each other and focus on policy. One leadership contender, Liz Kendall, has rejected calls for her to pull out of the race to help beat Mr Corbyn. Our political correspondent, Ross Hawkins, reports. A leadership contest this party hoped would find a winner for the future has set against each other with big beasts of its past. Yesterday, Tony Blair suggested that if your heart was with left-wing candidate jeremy Corbyn, you needed a transplant. Today, his former deputy went on radio to go on the attack. Ifound it absolutely staggering. I have a lot of respect for Tony Blair and I worked with him for a lot of years. Next stop, the TV studio to explain why Labour’s leader, Harriet Harman, had been wrong to back child tax credit cuts. Should Harriet Harman be doing more or less? I think she has done enough, quite frankly. She did very well taking over in a difficult situation and she did quite well. Then she went beyond what I believe is her authority. He said it would not be a disaster ifjeremy Corbyn one. You are out of office, not for five years of ten, but form very many years to come. If the Labour Party does have a death wish that is where it will go. One senior Labour figure told me that some supporters of Liz Kendall were so badly -- figure told me that some supporters of Liz Kendall were so badly -- were so shocked at how badly her campaign was going that they thought she should duck out of the race. She said it would not happen. Will you stand aside? No. Ido not think sticking to the kind of comfort zone that saw us lose the last two elections is right. Neither do I want to see the party I love turn into a party of protest. The fight now for the soul of this party is opening old wounds as well as creating new ones, as Labour decides whether it is time to turn left. Let’s speak to our assistant political editor, Norman Smith. This time yesterday you are saying things could not get much worse. How wrong were you? Today, the collapse well and truly came off. john Prescott is pretty much laying into anyone and everyone in the Labour Party, attacking Tony Blair, Harriet Harman, Ed Miliband, David Miliband. The list goes on. Then he suggested it would not be a disaster ifjeremy Corbyn one. That announcement caused consternation among some of his colleagues. Liz Kendall suggested the other two were behind the rumour suggesting she should quit the contest because their campaign to in such difficulties. Then Alan Milburn saying, crikey, the party has a death wish. It tells us the progress, the success, the advance ofjeremy Corbyn, has Calvin eyes this contest. It -- ofjeremy Corbyn, has Calvin eyes this contest. It -- galvanised this contest. Up until now it has been a fairly lifeless campaign. It has burst into life as people begin to realise how high the stakes are for the Labour Party in this contest. The stakes, bluntly, aren’t there. Whether Labour remains a credible, serious party in government, or whether it is heading off into the wilderness. The Home Secretary, Theresa May, has announced an independent review of deaths in police custody in England and Wales. It follows a number of high-profile cases and allegations of wrongdoing. The inquiry will also cover serious non-fatal incidents. Our home affairs correspondent, june Kelly, is in Brixton in South London. june... When it comes to death in police custody, one of the most high profile cases in recent years has been that of Sean Rigg. He was brought here to Brixton police station after he was detained. His family, like others, had to fight for years to find out about his final hours and the treatment he received. Families of those who have died in police custody have long campaigned for better treatment with detained people and, if there is a death, more support for those left behind. In 2008, Sean Rigg, a musician who was 40, suffered a violent, schizophrenic episode. He was arrested, handcuffed and forcefully restrained facedown. He was confined in a police van four in 11 minutes and then led into the custody area of Brixton police station where he collapsed. It was caught on CCTV. He died a short time later. An inquest ruled that officers used unsuitable force. The rules of death like this will look at mental health care facilities. It will also examine the use of restraint and the current support for families of the deceased. For his sister, the last one is especially important. The focus should be families. They must be at the core of this review. It is very important, so that there is confidence in families that this will be a really effective change. The review will examine custody issues in England and Wales. Campaigners say previous reviews have failed to deliver. This has got to be more than a public relations exercise. It has to be a review that is prepared to ensure there is effective, systemic change and we have a proper system of accountability. Ultimately, the good investigation process should lead to a reduction in the number of deaths. In her speech, the Home Secretary will say that every death in custody has the potential to undermine dramatically the relationship between the public and the police. The Home Secretary will be making that speech later this afternoon for the latest figures show that when it comes to death in custody, in England and Wales last year there were 17, and that is the highest figure for five years. Car production in the UK hit a seven-year high in the first half of this year. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders says that, in total, more than 73,000 cars were built betweenjanuary and june. It marks the best half-year figures since 2008, and means three cars were coming off the production line every minute. An inquest has heard how diet pills bought abroad on the internet sent a 21-year-old girl’s temperature soaring to deadly levels. Eloise Parry bought the tablets as a slimming aid. But they contained a chemical highly toxic to humans, which sent her body into shutdown. After the inquest, Eloise’s mother said ""looking good should never cost you your health - or your life."" Our correspondent, Andrew Plant, is in Shrewsbury. Andrew. .. Eloise Parry checked herself into hospitaljust Eloise Parry checked herself into hospital just down the Eloise Parry checked herself into hospitaljust down the road from here in April, saying she did not feel they were and she had taken some pills she brought online. Alarm bells only started to ring when toxicology reports came back full that she had large amounts of the drug, DNP, in hersystem. It is highly toxic to humans and sent her temperature soaring to dangerous levels. A 21-year-old student studying for a degree in childcare, but Eloise Parry was secretly worried about her weight and had found what she thought was a short cut to staying slim. So-called diet pills discovered on the internet and delivered forjust a few pounds. But she was taking an industrial chemical that cost her her life. Her mother made a direct appeal to others who might be considering taking the drug. Please look at what happened here. She is not the first. Please do not do it. You are killing yourself. You are destroying your health. It is not worth it. This is something nobody should ever be consuming. It is not a pharmaceutical. It is a dangerous chemical, not for human consumption. Fire This chemical is not suitable for human consumption. Available online and from websites abroad, DNP is sold as a fat burning aid. Infact, it’s a banned substance, highly toxic to those who take it. There was so little difference between what would be an acceptable dose and a lethal dose and the body’s response varies from person to person. A dose that might be safe for one person could be lethal for someone else. The Food Standards Agency lists DNP as a hazardous chemical, extremely dangerous to human health. just two tablets can be lethal. Eloise had taken eight. Police say they’re still investigating the source of the DNP sold to Eloise, and are warning others not to be tempted by a quick fix that could prove deadly. BNP is nothing new. It was first band in the USA in the 1930s, when people were using it as a slimming aid with some very serious side effects -- aid with some very serious side effects -- DNP. The problem is it’s appearing online, marketed as a slimming pill, and on websites which are based abroad. Our top story this lunchtime. As divers continued their investigation into what happened to 12-year-old jessica Lawson, who died on a school trip to France, her parents said they want to return her body home as soon as possible. Still to come, good free museums and art galleries soon be a thing of the past? Later on thing of the past? BBC London: Exploring disability hate crime - we speak to Adam Pearson, a documentary-maker who’s experienced it first hand. And the annual swan upping reveals the ""senseless shooting"" of birds and cygnets on the River Thames. It’s the biggest prize in World sailing, the America’s Cup, and Britain has never won it. But now Sir Ben Ainslie - the most successful sailor in Olympic history - is hoping to put that right. And he’s well placed to take on the defenders, Oracle Team USA - he helped them to win the Cup in 2013. Sir Ben wants his British team to qualify for next year’s race in Bermuda. Well, that process gets under way in Portsmouth today - and our correspondent Duncan Kennedy is there. ~ Iam here! I am here! This is Sir Ben in the BAR Team boat and you have to go back to Queen Victoria’s time to see the last America’s Cup racing on the Solent. But it has never won it in 164 years but there are points at stake that Sir Ben will take forward to the finals of the America’s Cup. Because what he wants to do is bring it home for Britain. Back on the Solent for the first time in 164 years. The America’s Cup teams gliding out of Portsmouth Harbour in their flying boats. The Land Rover BAR Team, led by Sir Ben Ainslie, alongside France, Sweden, japan, New Zealand and of course, the Cup holders, Team Oracle from America. This is what’s coming up. Six one-tonne vessels, skimming through the water on carbon fibre foils. Sea speeds hitting 50 miles an hour. The racing is fast and brutal. An unleashed dash over 25 minutes. They are more like planes than boats. The crews need crash helmets, not sailing caps. Sir Ben Ainslie knows this is the world’s oldest sporting trophy. He won it last time with the Americans. Now he wants to bring it home for Britain. We’ve never won it in Britain, that’s what we’re all working towards with our team, to right that wrong and get the trophy back here where it belongs. Portsmouth is ready to welcome half a million visitors for the event over the next four days. One of the series where vital points will be earned for the finals in Bermuda in 2017. When I see those fins, just three feet off the water and nothing else there, it’s absolutely fantastic. It will be really exhilarating. It’s good to actually have a boat that people are getting excited about because it’s so fast. Sailing is back on the map. Yes, definitely. It’s set the place alight, hasn’t it? The cup we want. Do you think we can? Yes. Absolutely. NEWSREEL: She’s an odds-on favourite. It all began in 1851 off the Isle of Wight. The Americans have dominated but not won it ever since. They can be beaten. This ancient trophy was brought ashore in Southsea today, a glimpse of the prize at stake for what is now a global billion pound sport. It’ll be the fastest flotilla in world sailing. The weather looks good, the crews and the boats ready to rise up for this phenomenal event. You join us live again on the Solent, alongside Sir Ben’s boat. He’s been putting it through its paces this morning, along with the five other challengers on the Solent, japan, France and America included. It’s the Americans they have in their sights mostly. This morning, Sir Ben said he is confident but not complacent. He wants to put the points on the board, ready to take on the Americans in the finals, starting here in the Solent, for the first time in 164 years. Realfall on America’s Cup racing is back in British waters. Duncan Kennedy, keep holding on! The former head of MI5 warned of the risk of ""political embarrassment"" from child sexual abuse claims allegedly involving MPs. A letter written in 1986 by Sir Anthony Duff followed warnings an MP had a ""penchant for small boys"". The note, found in a search by the Cabinet Office, was not disclosed to Home Office review last year. Our correspondent Daniel Sandford is here with me now. What is in the new documents? A lot of focus is on that letter written by Sir Anthony Duff to the Cabinet Secretary, the most powerful civil servant in government, and it related to allegations about an MP who was said to have a pot shot for small boys. The MP has not been named. -- small boys. The MP has not been named. -- penchant. PeterWanless said nobody seems to be worrying about what the risks after the children. He says that’s indicative of what the attitudes were at that time. Visit these documents are only emerging now? It is. These documents were supposed to have been dug out of the Home Office and government departments. People realised there might be more documents in very strange Cabinet Office store, known as the Cabinet Secretary’s miscellaneous papers, uncatalogued, no miscellaneous papers, uncatalogued, no record of what’s in there. Eventually, some civil servants dug around in that store of papers and found references to Sir Peter Morrison, Sir Liam Britain, Sir Peter Heymann, Sir William van Star Benzie, all of whom were senior MPs or senior intelligence officials. We don’t know what those documents say, but the documents were difficult to find and it will make people say, how is it they got put their rather than somewhere easy to find? Could free museums and art galleries soon be a thing of the past? The Museums Association has told the BBC that institutions all over the country are considering introducing admission fees because of budget cuts. Well, York Art Gallery is about to re-open after an £8 million refit - and when it does tourists and locals are going to have to pay to get in. Our arts correspondent Colin Paterson reports. The summer holidays. Families with weeks to fill. For many, free museums are a handy help, but would they still go if they had to pay? On a wet day, it’s a good option for us really, so yeah, price is important, definitely. When you add up the price forfour of us it can be quite expensive in some places. If we’re talking a couple of pounds then it doesn’t matter, but if it’s £10 then it changes your choice. Because your daughter might not have the concentration to be there for long? Exactly. York Art Gallery has been free to visit for more than a decade. On 1st of August it reopens with £8 million of improvements, but there is one other big change. A £7.50 entrance fee. The Conservative manifesto stated that national museums funded by central government have to remain free, but not those which rely on local council funds for support. We’ve had a 60% reduction since 2012. We’ve tried to absorb it. We’ve had to make people redundant. Really the bottom line is that we just don’t have enough money now without charging. And there’s a belief that what’s happening in York could soon be reflected in the rest of the UK. I’m absolutely certain that museums all over the country are considering introducing admission fees, in order to try to help plug the gaps that are appearing in their budgets. My counsel will be to be very careful. It will work in some places. It might work in York. I doubt very much it would work in a place like Burnley or Rotherham - those places are not full of tourists all wanting to spend lots of money in museums. Two other museums in York are also set to charge locals for first time, so for many the school holidays could be about to get a lot more expensive. For years the closure of the village pub and the village shop were seen as a sign of rural decline - as high rents, competition from supermarkets, and a lack of trade turned many of them into ghost towns. But a fight back is underway - with new figures this morning showing there are now more than 300 shops and 30 pubs in the UK owned and run by their local communities, asjohn Maguire reports. CHOIR SINGS This rendition of the Welsh national anthem by the community choir Cor Dewi Sant would give the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff a run for its money. Surprisingly for such a large choir, members come mainly from three villages. Many from this one, Llanarmon-yn-Ial. In many ways it’s a typical village of around 500 people, but where so many rural pubs and shops are closing elsewhere, here they survive. We get people wanting teas and coffees that live only around the corner, but it’s somewhere for them to come and chat and meet other people. For the volunteers as well, it’s something for them to do and mix and just spend a couple of hours chatting. Lovely. The shop is run as a cooperative. They bake their own pies, pasties and cakes. Elaine jones is paid to run the store but most other staff are volunteers. Glenys jones works here two days a week. Her husband died injanuary and Glenys says the shop has helped her hugely. Thank you, love, thank you. I’ve met characters in here that I didn’t know we had in this village. And you’ve lived here for 40 years. I’ve lived here over 40 years, yeah. So it’s been great for me to get me out, back into the social life and everything, and of course it’s helped the shop as well so it works both ways really, yes. A few feet away, and The Raven Inn’s latest addition, a boules court, is proving very popular. The pub has been run by the community for six years. Earlier this month it and the shop received royal approval, celebrated by Prince Charles’ the Pub Is The Hub campaign. And The Raven is a prime example. Everybody’s involved. If you’re not physically capable of doing it you put your money over the bar, which is helping keep the pub going. Some staff are paid. Important - the young people who otherwise would have to travel elsewhere to find similar work - but mainly it’s about the volunteers. There’s a list ofjobs up here on the wall. It says each would only take about an hour a week. All sorts of stuff, from ordering wine, ordering beer, keeping tourism websites updated, even ordering logs and lighting the fire in the winter. Of course, any self-respecting rural pub needs a roaring log fire to welcome guests in the winter months. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Nick Miller. Summaries on the back foot. It’s changeable over the next few days. This area of low pressure, this is what’s coming in for tomorrow across southern parts of the UK. Notjust heavy rain but strong winds. Further north, I’m hiding this area of low pressure, coming into more of the UK by the time we get to Sunday. For the rest of this afternoon, not a huge amount of sunshine. Not much warmth. A lot of dry weather. Showers are merging to give longer spells of rain. Scotland, Northern Ireland, parts of northern England and Wales and the south-west. There is a lot of dry weather this afternoon. As the showers fade, with the wind easing, it will eventually, 8-12 . Here the wind easing, it will eventually, 8-12. Here comes the rain for tomorrow morning. A fine start for much of Scotland, Northern Ireland and northern England. Bear in mind there could be heavy, slow moving showers during the day. Umbrellas at the ready. Forthe showers during the day. Umbrellas at the ready. For the rest of England and Wales, plenty of cloud and there are outbreaks of rain from the word go. The rain is heaviest across southern parts of England, later into the south-east and East Anglia. There is some fine detail to work into the forecast, we will refine it in the next few hours. You need to cater for the possibility of lighter rain reaching southern parts of northern England. Through this zone, the heaviest rain could be 20 millimetres or more. Miserable for driving. The potential for disruption from that much rain. It will feel chilly in it. Nowhere is particularly one tomorrow. Focusing on the area with the heaviest rain, south-east England and East Anglia, the winds pick-up. We could see gales in places. The winds may be disruptive. Miserable weather, but the potential to step up to possibly disruptive. We will keep you updated. The start of the weekend, the system begins to pull away. Breezy down the eastern side of the UK, with a few showers. Many others have a fine start. For the America’s Cup, rain tomorrow, better Saturday rain on Sunday. The next area of low pressure comes in. Eventually, the rain will cover more of the UK with freshening winds. We may not see too much in Scotland and eastern areas later in the day. Tomorrow’s rain, there a Met Office weather warning to read about online. Nowa reminder of our top story this lunchtime. As divers continue their investigation into what happened to 12-year-old jessica Lawson, who died on a school trip to France, her parents arrive in the country. That’s all from us. Now on BBC One it’s time for the news where you are. Welcome to BBC London News. I’m Victoria Hollins. A man in his 50s has died in a hit and run in Hornchurch. The man was struck by a carjust after midnight and died at the scene. Our reporter, Katharine Carpenter, is at the scene. this lone bunch of flowers marks the spot where a man lost his life last night, here at this junction just on Hornchurch Road. Police were called here just after midnight where they found a man critically injured. He died a short time later. Police say they are looking for the driver of a black BMW three series which was seenin black BMW three series which was seen in the company of two other cars in Hornchurch town centre. One neighbour told me that cars do dry very quickly along this road, particularly at night. It is a fast junction. I have lived here for about five years. I have not known there to be many accidents here but it is a kind ofjunction where there are two lanes narrowing into one and there are quite a few arguments. The incident here in the early hours of the morning occurred when the Met released figures saying 1212 pedestrians were involved in hit and runs last year. 132 resulted in serious injury and over 1000 cyclists were also involved in hit and run accident. This incident has been handed over to the serious collisions investigations unit. They are examining CCTV and still trying to trace the driver and the car. It’s notjust the cost of residential property that continues to rise across the capital, office space is getting more and more expensive too. The latest figures from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors suggest tenant demand has risen for the tenth consecutive quarter. But what does that mean for the small business? Earlier today Alice Bhandhukravi spoke to the Chief Economist at RICS, Simon Rubinsohn. ~ I think the survey effectively as showing that the property market in London is very strong and it is continuing to strengthen. The reason for that is that the underlying economy is also strong. Lots ofjobs ",,

On BBC London: A man’s knocked down and killed in East London - as figures reveal a rise in the number of hit and runs. And why office rents in the capital are set to rise at record levels. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. The Home Secretary, Theresa May, has announed a major review into deaths and serious incidents in police custody. Today it was revealed the number in England and Wales has reached its highest level for five years. Figures from the Independent Police Complaints Commission show there were 17 deaths in detention last year- an increase of almost a third on the previous year. Since 2004, 224 people have died in or following police custody. No police officer has ever been prosecuted. Our home affairs correspondent, june Kelly, reports.

He was confined in a police damned for 11 minutes and lead into the custody area of Brixton police station where he collapsed. It was caught on CCTV . He died a short time later. An inquest ruled officers had used unsuitable force. Today the Home Secretary came to launch her review into deaths in custody. With an audience which included briefed families, she said all such deaths had the potential to dramatically undermine the relationship between the public and the police. I have been struck by the pain and suffering of families still looking for answers. Who have encountered not compassion and redress from the authorities, but what they feel is evasiveness and obstruction. I have also heard first-hand the frustration of police officers and staff whose training and procedures can end up causing bureaucracy and delay. I liked what she said. I thought she was honest and truthful. But talk is cheap. You do not realise the effect it can have on you until it happens to you. But it can happen to anybody. It is unfortunate and really surprising and shocking that the system systematically fails families continuously. Campaigners stress a disproportionate number of those who died following contact with the police are from black or minority ethnic communities. They say previous reviews have failed to deliver. They hope this one will be different. A 15-year-old boy from Lancashire has pleaded guilty to inciting an act of terrorism by encouraging a deadly attack on police officers in Australia. He’d tried to persuade a man there, who shared his admiration for so-called Islamic State, to kill officers at an Anzac Day parade in Melbourne in April. The attack never took place. Ed Thomas is in Lancashire. What more can you tell us? A senior counterterrorism officer told me these messages were much more than an angry teenager sounding off on the internet. They contained real intent and anger. Asking an extremist thousands of miles away to kill. From his home in Blackburn, this schoolboy planned his international terror attack. We cannot name the 15-year-old but in court he was said to have been inspired by so-called Islamic State. Today he admitted sending thousands of messages to this man, Sevdet Besim, in Australia, calling on him to kill. The plan was to murder police officers at an Anzac Day parade when Australians remember their country’s sacrifice in World War I. In one message, the Blackburn teenager told Sevdet Besim, I suggest you break into someone’s house and get your first take of bedding. Sevdet Besim replied, it seemed a lot will risk the -- replied, it seemed a lot will risk the -- first taste of the heading. The teenager told Sevdet Besim, you are a lone wolf. The teenager warned him of the difficulty of beheading a person, he advised him, you have got to be a lion, especially because you are doing it in public. What followed were adorned terror raids in Melbourne, all because of a plan made in Blackburn IHR -- in Melbourne, all because of a plan made in Blackburn IHR -- Dawn terror raids in Melbourne, all because of a plan made in Blackburn. This Lancashire community group brings in children and youth workers and councillors to talk about the risks of extremism. I believe his parents have a great responsibility. It is their child and they have got to keep an eye on what they are doing. Somebody should have seen something early on with this boy, his friends, his teachers, his family. Somebody should have known something was not right. I want to make clear it has nothing to do with Islam. Islam is all about peace. In court, the judge delayed sentencing the 15-year-old so he could understand better what went on in Lancashire. He asked, was the boy indoctrinated? How could this be stopped from happening again? We feel we are demonised as a community and young Muslim people are vilified and demonised. We can do more and social media and the media in general has a huge part to play in changing people’s attitudes towards the Muslim communities. The 15-year-old boy will be sentenced on September for inciting terrorism and encouraging the murder of police officers. The infighting over the Labour leadership race has turned into open recrimination, with senior party figures publicly divided and one of the candidates rejecting calls to withdraw. Liz Kendall’s campaign has been floundering, as that of left-winger jeremy Corbyn gathers pace, but she insists she will fight to the end. Our political correspondent, Carole Walker, has more.

Liz Kendall has rejected suggestions she should bow out of the race to give one on her rivals a better chance of stopping the leading left-wing contenderjeremy leading left-wing contender jeremy Corbyn. leading left-wing contenderjeremy Corbyn. I will be fighting for what I believe in until the end. Ido not think sticking to the kind of comfort zone that saw as lose the last two elections is right and I do not want to see the party I love turn into a party of protest. jeremy Corbyn, once a lonely figure on the left of the party, is ahead in the latest poll with a campaign opposing austerity and nuclear weapons, building union support, he has prompted a backlash. The former leader Tony Blair who took on the left and changed his party has warned it not to go back to its old ways. Yesterday he told those whose hearts were with jeremy Corbyn to get a transplant. He infuriated even his own former deputy. To suggest if you voted forjeremy Corbyn that you would need to have an operation, a heart transplant, such abuse, it is unacceptable. Let us get down to the policies, let us get down to how we are different to the Tories. Another veteran of the Tony Blair years waded in with his own warning. I’m afraid history tells a very brutal lesson about what happens when Labour goes to the left. You out of office for very many years to come. If the Labour Party does have a death wish, that is where it will go. If it is to succeed, it needs to win seats like this, Nuneaton in the Midlands. A Labour target at the last election where the Tories increased their majority, sealing victory for the Conservatives. These young Labour supporters know who they want to lead the party. jeremy Corbyn will be able to keep Labour where they started and keep them where they started in the first place. I have seen some of his values and he looks the best one because he sticks by his guns. By the time the new leader is chosen, Parliament will be back, they will have to make some swift decisions on how to oppose the Tory government. And how to unite a party bruised and battered by the leadership contest. And there are seven more weeks of this struggle before the Leader of the Opposition can begin that daunting task. The mother of a student who died after taking highly toxic diet pills has called for a clampdown on websites selling the potentially deadly drugs. Eloise Parry from Shrewsbury, who was 21, is believed to have bought the tablets online but they contained an industrial chemical which is poisonous to humans. Andrew Pla nt reports. A 21-year-old student studying for a degree in childcare, but Eloise Parry was secretly worried about her weight and was battling with bulimia. She found on the internet what she thought was a short cut to staying slim. Marketed as diet pills online and bought forjust a few pounds, but the tablets contained an industrial chemical highly toxic in humans. They did trials with that in the ‘30s... Speaking after the inquest today, her mum now aware that doctors could do nothing to combat the chemical in her system. This drug had speeded up her metabolism and burnt her muscles out to the point that once her heart had stopped, it was too destroyed for them to start it up again. It was a really dreadful way to die. I can keep myself together for times like this, but then there are other days, for no reason at all, you just cry. This chemical is not suitable for human consumption. DNP is sold as a fat-burning aid. Infact, it is a hazardous substance that can build up in the body to lethal levels. The body’s response varies from person-to-person. A dose that mightjust be safe for one person could be lethal for someone else. just two tablets can prove fatal. Eloise had taken eight. Police say they are still investigating the source of the DNP sold to Eloise. Meanwhile, her family is urging others not to be tempted by a quick fix that could prove deadly. Andrew Plant, BBC News, in Shrewsbury. The fatal accident inquiry into the bin lorry crash in Glasgow last year has heard the driver blacked out ""fora couple of minutes"" while driving a bus five years ago. Evidence is being gathered to determine what happened leading up to the crash last December, which killed six people. Today, an inspector for First Bus said Harry Clarke had collapsed at the wheel in 2010 and was later given the all-clear by a paramedic. Funding for the Government’s flagship Green Deal home energy efficiency programme is to be scrapped due to poor take-up. The scheme allowed people to make energy efficiency improvements to their homes, such as insulation, and then pay for them from the savings on their energy bills. Our industry correspondent, john Moylan, has the details. This home in north London will be warmer this winter. It is being covered in solid wall insulation. According to the owner, the £10,000 project would not have happened without the Green Deal. With the grant, I proceeded to do the work. If the grant was scrapped or minimised, I would not have done the work in the first instance. I would not have envisaged going ahead and doing it again in the future without such a sizeable grant. The Green Deal was the previous government’s flagship scheme to get more of us to insulate our homes. It was perceived as overcomplicated, was dogged with problems and critics argue it simply has not worked. The pay-as-you-save scheme involved loans and cash hand-outs. It’s benefitted just over 33,000 homes since it launched two and half years ago. It has cost in excess of £171 million. Basically, this is an insulation slab, which covers a house like a blanket. Like many builders, Phil Howard’s business relies heavily on work from the Green Deal. Today, he was devastated by the news the Government has pulled the plug. It’s been a booming industry for the last maybe 12 months. Suddenly, the boom is just going to stop. I don’t know how people will keep employed when the workjust isn’t there. There won’t be any work because people won’t go ahead with the work that they wanted to go ahead with, without the funding. The Government says it is acting to protect taxpayers due to low take-up and concerns about industry standards. But while existing applications won’t be affected, with nothing to replace the Green Deal, it will be accused of leaving households and the industry out in the cold. john Moylan, BBC News. The time is 6:15pm. Our top story this evening: The Home Secretary calls for a review of deaths in police custody, after the number reaches its highest level for five years.

And the annual count of swans on the Thames records a decline in their numbers amid fears some are being illegally shot. Rural housing campaigners are warning that the government’s plan to extend Right To Buy legislation will decimate the provision of affordable homes. Ministers intend to allow housing association tenants in England to buy their homes at a discount. But rural housing groups say selling off these properties will leave local, young families with nowhere to live. Our social affairs correspondent, Michael Buchanan, reports from Saham Toney in Norfolk. An English rural idyll, a glorious, peaceful respite from the stresses of city living. And that’s the problem. Many local villagers have been priced out of Saham Toney by retirees and second-home owners. Teaching assistant Sarah Green and her family are lucky. They live on this quiet housing association cul-de-sac. The government’s plans would allow them to buy their home at a discount but they are not interested. I don’t think it is my right to have one of these houses because where is everyone else going to go? The younger generations coming into the village, well, they won’t be able to, will they because there won’t be any homes like this. The family home was built on land bought cheaply by the housing association. The farmer who sold it fears Right To Buy could see the houses eventually sold to outsiders. I would not do it again if Right To Buy came in. If a few people can just sell these houses on in a few years’ time, and make a big profit, it is not serving the village. Campaigners fear Right To Buy will further deplete affordable housing stock. just 12% of rural properties are social housing, compared to 19% in urban areas. House prices in rural communities are on average 26% more expensive than in towns and cities. Under existing Right To Buy laws, for every eight rural council houses sold in recent years, just one has been replaced. If these houses are sold, the idea is that the local council sells high-value properties it owns and compensates the housing association. But in many rural areas, the council does not own any property, certainly none of high value. So how, ask the housing associations, are they meant to be reimbursed? The money, hint ministers, will come from urban areas. Central government will ensure housing associations are able to do one-for-one funding. We will make sure we support the discounts that the housing associations will give and ensure people have a chance to buy a home of their own. We will outline the details when we publish the Housing Bill in autumn this year. Campaigners want rural areas to be exempt from government plans, otherwise, they warn, only the rich will be able to live in scores of English villages. Michael Buchanan, BBC News, Norfolk. An investigation is continuing into the death of a 12-year-old British girl - who died while on a school trip to France. jessica Lawson reportedly fell into a lake when a pontoon she was playing on overturned. Fellow pupils and teachers from jessica’s school arrived back in the UK this afternoon. Our correspondent jenny Hill is at the scene of the accident in Liginiac, in central France. ""We love you and we miss you"", the words ofjessica’s father today as he paid tribute on social media. On an evening like this, it is a most impossible to imagine what happened here on Tuesday. Nevertheless, as French investigators continue their work, jessica’s sister urged people to remember herfor work, jessica’s sister urged people to remember her for watching was rather than what you could have been. -- what she was. It is high season, you are but no sign of the school trip which went so badly wrong. Yesterday, investigators searched the lake for clues. They are still trying to determine how, and why, a British schoolgirl lost her life. In her father’s words, jessica Lawson was beautiful, loving and kind. The 12-year-old was on a school trip with 23 other youngsters. Some of them were playing on this pontoon when it apparently overturned. TRANSLATION: That is the platform that you can see just over there. There were around 20 kids on it and unfortunately, that being flipped over. One girl suffered a nasty blow as it turned over and she fell into the water. A minute or a minute and a half later, people reacted. These pictures were taken a few minutes later. A lifeguard pulled jessica from the water. Rescuers managed to revive her on the beach. She was airlifted to hospital in the motion but died later, just a few hours before her parents arrived. TRANSLATION: We took all necessary measures to make the beach safe for swimming before opening it. The enquiry will establish the causes. I hope we have not made a mistake. That would be very serious. The centre has existed for 30 years and there had never been an accident. It is still not entirely clear what happened here on the lake. That is why the postmortem results will be of great interest to investigators. So, too, will the statements of the children who were on the water with jessica. They have all now been taken back home to Britain. At their school this morning, flowers and tears forjessica. Her headteacher has described what happened as a dreadful shock for the whole community. It is really, really upsetting that she is gone and I can’t talk to her. Sorry to the family. It’s tragic. Terrible. jessica’s family are still thought to be in France. They said in a statement that their focus is now on getting her home, to be remembered forever. jenny Hill, BBC News. Scientists believe they may have found the most Earth-like planet to date.

The planet, called Kepler-452b, and the star it orbits show some intriguing similarities with the Earth and Sun. Britain’s car industry says it’s had the best first half of a year since 2008. The Society of Motor Manufacturing and Traders said almost 800,000 cars were produced in the UK from january tojune. Let’s go live now to our transport correspondent, Richard Westcott, who’s on a Mini production line in Oxford, what’s driving the boom in business? ~ Iamon I am on the Mini production line. We’re moving on now. To give you some idea of the speed, by the time I finish this report, about two minutes, two brand-new cars will have been driven out of here, completed. It’s been a bumper six months UK car manufacturing, with 794,000 cars built up untiljune. Interestingly, eight out of ten of those are exported abroad. The biggest market apart from Europe is China. In China, it is a mark of quality to have a British built car. Changing fortunes since the 1970s! Lets talk to Steve Fallon from Ordo Express. How come we are getting so good at making cars? It’s a really slick operation. Guys and girls on production lines up and down the country are building efficiently and the supplier base is making sure we have the right parts in the right places at the right time. And crucially, these are cause people want to buy, whether it is jaguar Land Rover, Bentley, Rolls-Royce, Toyota in Derbyshire, wander in Swindon, Nissan in the north-east building more cars than all of Italy. Then the unions, where they are building the new Vauxhall Astra at Ellesmere Port, that plant could have been shot if the unions had not worked with management and government to make sure it stays open and builds great new cars. That does not happen in many countries. Lots of these cars go to Europe and we have a referendum coming up at some point. Could it make a difference? If it is a no vote, I don’t think these people will be shutting down any time soon. But the people I’ve spoken to in the industry favour the yes vote because it makes it easier to sell cars. Thank you forjoining us. 1.5 million cars built in the UK last year but that’s nowhere near the record which is nearly 2 million, set in 1972.

The America’s Cup - the biggest prize in world sailing- has never been won by Britain in its 164-year history. But this time the British team, led by Olympic gold medallist Sir Ben Ainslie, is hoping to change that. They’re looking to qualify for next year’s race in Bermuda. And that process got underway in Portsmouth today. Our correspondent Duncan Kennedy is there. Duncan? Fiona, these boats, these crews, really are the cream of world sailing. Including of course, Sir Ben Kingsley. He knows this competition began on the Solent, 164 years ago. He also knows that Britain has never won it but he now believes firmly that finally, the oldest trophy in international world sport can be brought back home. They are the fastest boats taking part in the oldest of races. Wolf will America’s Cup sailing has returned to the place it all began. -- full throttle. Which shies on Sir Ben Kingsley’s vessel.

Ben Ainslie tells us his vessel could go up to 30, 40, even 50 mph sees speed out here but he also realises the competition is intense. He knows to get points, he’s going to have to go like the wind. Sir Ben helped the United States win the oldest trophy in international world sport last time. Now he wants to bring it home. We have never won it in Britain. That is what we are all working towards with the team, to right that wrong and get the trophy back where it belongs. The organisers say this type of sailing is so spectacular, 500,000 people will watch it in the next four days. When I see those fins, three feet off the water, and nothing else there, it is absolutely fantastic! It is good to have a boat that people are getting excited about because it is so vast. Sailing is back on the map? Definitely. The first and last time full, point scoring America’s Cup racing took place on British waters, Queen Victoria was watching. Now Sir Ben Ainslie hopes to gain the meant for the finals in Bermuda. The next four days, expect these crews and these boats to lift sailing to new heights. Duncan Kennedy, BBC News, Portsmouth. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Sarah Keith-Lucas. This was the view across the Haven Canal this morning, a tranquil site. Things don’t look quite the same come tomorrow morning. A real change in the weather over the next 24 hours in the shape of a low pressure system working in from the south-west. We are going to be seeing one or two showers through the rest of this evening. Overnight, rain sweeping in from the south-west of England and Wales. Turning wet across southern England and Wales. Further north, clearer skies so quite a chilly start to Friday morning across Scotland, Northern Ireland and northern England. Further south, we are concentrating on the fairly heavy way working its way east woods across England and Wales through the day. Turning quite breezy as well. Many places seeing about 20 millimetres or even double that in one or two places come the end of Friday. Temperatures down a notch, 18 degrees in London and further north, sunshine and showers. With the chance of heavy rain and strong winds around in the next 24 hours, there could well be some disruption to travel on the roads. We keep with the wet and windy weather across southern areas through into the early hours of Saturday, working towards the south-east of England and East Anglia. Behind that, the weather begins to quieten down as we move into Saturday. In the day on Saturday, low pressure pushes its way east woods and then we see clearer skies with a bit more sunshine. Temperatures probably down on what we would expect for the time of year, 13-22. on what we would expect for the time of year, 13-22 . Sunday starts off dry for central and eastern areas but the next batch of wet weather works in from the West and later in the day on Sunday. A bit cool for the time of year again and the breeze picking up. During the weekend, the weather looks a bit mixed. For most of us, Saturday is the better day of the weekend but there are weather warnings in force. You can check the latest by heading on to the BBC weather website.

In an exclusive interview at the White House the President said Britain had to maintain a strong role on the international stage. Having the United Kingdom in the European Union gives us much greater confidence about the strength of the transatlantic union. The President also talked about the challenges of his presidency and said his greatest frustration was the failure to tackle gun control. It is the fact that the United States of America is the one advanced nation on earth in which we do not have sufficient common sense gun safety laws.

A man is knocked down and killed - the same day figures reveal a rise in the number of hit and runs in the capital. And the sky-high price of commercial property in the capital as office rents continue to rise. We’ll have more on the president’s Good evening. President Obama has told the BBC that it would be ‘unthinkable’ for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union. He said it gave greater confidence in the strength of the trance atlantic Russian. He said his greatest frustration was the failure to tackle gun control. Mr Obama was speaking to our North America Editorjon Sopel who’s at the White House tonight. Yes, the President has been in an expansive mood, talking ahead of his trip to Africa, talking about how important the strategic relationship was with Britain but also the difficulties and the frustrations attached to being President of the United States. It will be Barack Obama’s first return to his ancest alhome since becoming President. My first trip to Kenya was when I was still a young man, 27... Security will be a key theme of the visit as it is everywhere else in the world. He told me how crucial it was that Britain maintained its defence spending. We don’t have a more important partner than Great Britain. For him to make that commitment when there is a budget agenda that is confined, a budget envelope that is confined, it is significant. If there is relief in the administration at that decision, there is unease about the EU referendum and the possibility of Britain leaving the European Union. Having the United Kingdom in the European Union gives us much greater confidence about the strength of the transatlantic union. It is part of the cornerstone of institutions built after World War II that has made the world safer and more prosperous. We want to make sure that the United Kingdom continues to have that influence. The recent killings of Afro-Americans at a Bible study class in Charleston raise theed the most Rexed question in US politics, namely gun control. Here the President was candid. He told me he thought he had been thwarted. If you ask me where has been the one area where I feel that I have been most frustrated and most stymied, it is the fact that the United States of America is the one advanced nation on earth in which we do not have sufficient common sense, gun safety laws. Even in the face of repeated mass killings and you know, if you look at the number of Americans killed since 9/II by terrorism, it is less than 100, Americans killed since 9/11 by terrorism, it is less than 100, if you look at the number that have been killed by gun violence it is in the tens of thousands. For us not to be able to resolve that issue has been something that is distressing but it is not something that I intend to stop working on in the remaining 18 months. Mr President thank you very much. Well, the President seemed in confident and a relaxed mood. Although he took a terrible beating in the myth term elections last November, everyone saying that the administration was going to do nothing from now on, he has achieved many thing, the Iran nuclear deal, the Cuban diplomat relations improved health reforms embedded. But there is the frustration on the question of race and gun control he has not made the progress he had hoped to. He is to work for the last 18 months to make progress there. Did I sense confidence that he would be able to do that? Not really. A 15 year-old boy has become one of the youngest people to be convicted of a terrorism offence in Britain after he admitted encouraging a man to murder police officers in Australia. The teenager from Blackburn sent thousands of messages to the man, urging him to attack a parade on Anzac Day. The attack did not take place. Our correspondent Ed Thomas has more details. Anzac Day when Australians remember their country sacrificing the First World War. An occasion that the school boy tried to put at the centre of an international terror attack, directed from his home in Blackburn. We cannot name him. But the court heard he was fuelled by the Islamic State and sent thousands of e-mails to this man, calling on him to murder police officers. The Lancashire takener ~ -- teenagersaid. -- teenager said. He warned the man of the difficulty of beheading a person. Wh followed would dawn terror raids across Melbourne, all because of a plan made in Blackburn. So what went wrong? This Lancashire community group brings in children and youth workers to talk about the risks of extremism. I believe that his parents have a greater responsibility. At the end of the day it is their child. His parents, teachers, family, somebody should have pointed it out earlier, that something was not right. This is nothing to do Islam. Islam is all about peace. In court, the judge delayed sentencing the 15-year-old so he could understand better what went on here in Lancashire. He asked was the boy indoctrinated and how could this be stopped from happening again? We feel that as a community we are demonised and vilified. We can do more and social media and the media in general has a huge part to play in changing attitudes. The 15-year-old will be sentenced in September for inciting terrorism and murder. The Labour leadership candidate, Liz Kendall, has said that a victory for the left-wing contender, jeremy Corbyn, would be 'a disaster’ for the party. She is resisting calls from some colleagues to stand aside to help others defeat Mr Corbyn. Labour’s divisions have been further underlined by the party’s former deputy leader Lord Prescott, who criticised Tony Blair, for his outspoken attack yesterday n Mr Corbyn’s campaign. Our Political Correspondent Carole Walker reports. The contest to become Labour’s next leader has become a monumental battle over the future direction of the party. Tonightjeremy Corbyn, once a lonely figure on the left of the party was given a hero’s welcome in Bristol. His campaign, opposing austerity and nuclearweapons, building union support, has gained momentum. One recent poll put him in the lead and he faced quite a backlash. I that politics should be conducted on a comradely and basis. If people disagree then say, what they disagree on and keep their silly remarks to themselves. Liz Kendall Has rejected suggestions she should bow out of the race to give one of her rival as better chance of stopping Mr Corbyn but warned of the consequences if he won. It would be a disaster. Turning back to the politics of the 1980s that saw us suffer defeat after defeat does nothing to help the people we all came to politics to serve but neither do I think we can carry on saying and doing what we did over the next five years, over the next five years what we did over the last. We’ll get the same results. The former leader, Tony Blair, who took on the left and changed his party, has warned it not to go back to its old ways. Yesterday he told those whose hearts were with jeremy Corbyn, to get a transplant, infuriating even his own former deputy. To suggest if you voted forjeremy, you would need to have an operation, a heart transplant, that is such abuse. It is unacceptable. Let’s get down to policies, let’s get down to how we are different from the Tories. If Labour is to succeed it needs to win seats like this, Nuneaton the Midlands, a Labour target at the last election, where the Tories increased their majority, sealing victory for the Conservatives. These young Labour supporters on a skills course know who they want to lead their party. jeremy Corbyn will be able to keep Labour where they started and keep them where Labour started in the first place. I have seen some of his values, he looks the best one, he sticks by his guns. By the time the new leader is chosen, Parliament will be back, he or she will have to make swift decisions on how to oppose the Tory government and unite a party bruised and battered by this leadership contest. And there are seven more weeks of this struggle before the leader of the opposition can begin that daunting task. Hundreds of new planets spotted by NASA’s Kepler telescope include a world sharing many characteristics with Earth. It’s called Kepler-lI52b and mission scientists say it’s a hugely significant discovery, the most Earth-like planet ever seen and it’s already led to speculation about its ability to host forms of life. Our Science Editor David Shukman has more details. In a distant solar system, an amazing discovery, the first planet to be found that’s very like ours. The American space agency, Nasa, released this artist’s impression tonight of a world that could conceivably host life. Three, two, engine start. It was a telescope launched into space that made the breakthrough, the Kepler telescope. It watches for stars and looks for tiny dips in light, proof that planets are moving across them. Today we are announcing the discovery of an extra planet that, as far as we can tell, is a pretty good close cousin to the Earth and our Sun. The discovery of this planet is a milestone in the search for worlds similar to ours. For a start, it’s only about 60% bigger, and its orbit takes 385 days, not much more than ours. And crucially, that orbit takes it just the right distance from its star for water to exist at its surface, the so-called habitable zone. Infact, it’s a similar temperature to Earth and it’s at least a billion years older, which means there’s been plenty of time for life to have developed. But it is 1400 light years away, so maybe nearly impossible to find out. The biggest question out there is, are we alone in the universe? And so far we only know one place where life exists, and that’s right here on planet Earth. So what do you do if you want to find life? Well, you try and look for a place that’s very similar to where you know life has existed already, so we want to find somewhere very much like this. And that’s what we’ve found. Only last week Nasa revealed new images of the bizarre surface of Pluto, right on the edge of our solar system. Now, much deeper in space, this new discovery unveils a strangely familiar world. And of course, there may be many more planets like ours. The more we explore, the more surprises we find. David Shukman, BBC News. The Home Secretary, Theresa May, has announced an independent review into deaths and serious incidents in police custody. The number of deaths in police custody in England and Wales has reached its highest level for five years, asjune Kelly reports. For many years Marcia Rigg and her lawyer have been on a mission. Marcia was determined to find out the truth about her brother’s death in custody. In 2008, Sean Rigg, a musician who was Ao, suffered a violent schizophrenic episode. He was arrested, handcuffed and forcefully restrained face down. He was confined in a police van for 11 minutes and then led into the custody area of Brixton police station where he collapsed. This was caught on CCTV. He died a short time later. An inquest ruled that officers had used unsuitable force. Today, just up the road from Brixton police station, the Home Secretary came to launch her review into deaths in custody. With an audience that included bereaved families, she said all such deaths had the potential to dramatically undermine the relationship between the public and the police. I’ve been struck by the pain and the suffering of families still looking for answers, who have encountered not compassion and redress from the authorities but what they feel is evasiveness and obstruction. I’ve also heard at first hand the frustration of police officers and staff, whose training and procedures can end up causing bureaucracy and delay. I really liked what she said. I thought she was honest and truthful. But talk is cheap. You don’t realise the effect it can have on you until it happens to you. But it can happen to anybody. It’s unfortunate and really surprising and shocking that the system systematically fails families continuously. Campaigners stress that a disproportionate number of those who died following contact with the police are from black or minority ethnic communities. They say previous reviews have failed to deliver, they hope this one will be different. The owners of the Financial Times have sold the newspaper to the japanese group Nikkei for nearly £850 million. Pearson, which has owned the paper since the 1950s, said the sale would allow it to concentrate on its education publishing business, as Rory Cellan-jones reports. It was once just the bible of the City gent but the Financial Times has grown into a global British force in business news. For nearly 60 years it’s been owned by publishing giant Pearson, whose last Chief Executive said it would be sold over her dead body. Now it has been sold, to japan’s Nikkei. What has changed? Nikkei, we think, are better placed to help the Financial Times expand into Asia, to work together to grow more quickly in America, to take on this next big challenge in terms of explosion of mobile technology and social media. The Financial Times, which seemed to have a message for its own staff this morning, has had to adapt, like other papers, to the internet era. Ten years ago more than 400,000 people were paying for a print edition of the paper. Today, that has fallen to around 220,000. But when you factor in all of those people with digital subscriptions, nearly three quarters of a million are paying to read the FT in one form or another. Nikkei is already a powerful media firm beyond its japanese home, and it’s a mark of its ambition that it’s paid what many consider a luxury price for the FT. Global business news is one area ofjournalism that does still seem to pay. Elsewhere, the headwinds are strong. Even the profitable Daily Mail group saw its shares fall sharply today as it reported another downturn in print advertising. But one former Financial Times editor is hoping itsjournalists can pI’oSpâIâ UI’IdâIâ VIEW OWFIEFS. I imagine they will be anxious about this. They have a strong editor who will be standing up for editorial independence and I’m sure, Nikkei have spent a lot of money, a huge price, so they would be crazy to take steps that would damage the newspaper. They must understand what the ethos of the place is. As FT staff were told about the sale, they took to Twitter. Another great British institution is in the hands of foreign owners, just the kind of story its journalists have been reporting for years. Rory Cellan-jones, BBC News. The Government has been asked to review the classification of a drug that’s used as a slimming aid, following the death of a student. A coroner in Shropshire ruled that Eloise Parry, who was 21, had died as a result of an accidental overdose of diet pills that she’d bought online. The drugs contained the industrial chemical DNP, as Andrew Plant reports. A 21-year-old student studying for a degree in childcare, but Eloise Parry was secretly worried about her weight and was battling with bulimia. She found on the internet what she thought was a short cut to staying slim. Marketed as diet pills online and bought forjust a few pounds, but the tablets contained an industrial chemical highly toxic in humans. They did trials in the 30s. Speaking after her inquest today, her mum, now aware that doctors could do nothing to combat the chemical in her system. This drug had speeded up her metabolism and burned her muscles out to the point that once her heart had stopped, it was too destroyed for them to start it up again. It was a really dreadful way to die. I can keep myself together for times like this, but then there are the days, for no reason at all, you just cry. This chemical is not suitable for human consumption. DNP is sold as a fat-burning aid. Infact, it’s a hazardous substance that can build up in the body to lethal levels. The body’s response varies from person to person. A dose that mightjust be safe for one person could be lethal for someone else. just two tablets can prove fatal. Eloise had taken eight. Police say they are in still investigating the source of the DNP sold to Eloise. Meanwhile, her family is urging others not to be tempted by a quick fix that could prove deadly.

As we heard earlier, President Obama arrives in Kenya tomorrow on what’s been described as one of the major visits of his presidency, to strengthen security and economic ties. Over the past decade, parts of Africa have increasingly come under China’s influence, while America’s presence and power have become less visible. Andrew Harding has been to the tiny mountain kingdom of Lesotho to examine the state of America’s influence there. In the farthest corners of mountainous Lesotho, the outside world might seem a distant distraction. But globalisation is everywhere in Africa now. A Chinese couple runs the village shop. They’ve already been here two years. Chinese goods, even Chinese television. So where is America, not least when President Obama has, as he put it, the blood of Africa within him? Well, here, for starters. An HIV-Aids clinic. A quarter of the population of this tiny nation is infected. American money and expertise continuing to play a central role. The help has come from the US. A lot of people would have died long ago. Because many people in this country cannot afford anti-retrovirals, treatment for HIV. So America has played a key role. A very key role. And America is creating jobs here, too. 40,000 locals working in the garment industry, Lesotho’s biggest employer, exporting to the United States, thanks to special tax breaks. But look who the factory owners are. Again, it’s the Chinese and Taiwanese, quick to seeties opportuni on this continent. American investors do not come to Africa, particularly Lesotho. I don’t think they know much about this region and I think we need to do much to try and ensure that they know about what we are, what we do. In the meantime, the Chinese are everywhere. They are everywhere. I think they have been very good. I think they are great explorers. America still plays so many vital roles here and around the continent. President Obama remains an inspirational figure for many. But it is increasingly an arms length relationship. Other countries and cultures are simply much more visible here these days. So guess what language these orphans are learning now. China can often feel like the future here. But America plays a different role. And for now the continent needs them both. Andrew Harding, BBC News, Lesotho. After stage 18 of the Tour de France, Britain’s Chris Froome is still more than three minutes clear of his nearest rival. Unless he suffers a major setback in the Alps over the next two days, Froome should secure his second Tour title in Paris on Sunday. But as Natalie Pirks reports, Froome’s impressive performance is still leading to accusations of doping. just the pure climbers left... The climbs are gruelling but he is making it look easy. Still happy with the way it is going. For Chris Froome, victory now feels very close indeed. But such is his brilliance that he’s been riding under a permanent cloud of suspicion. In the exquisite beauty of the French Alps, drug cheats still cast an ugly shadow. It’s because of the utter domination of the team, which has not happened, especially on the Tour de France, since Lance Armstrong’s team. I’m not saying we should compare those two, but the visual impression is sometimes the same. Conspiracy theories with no foundation were broadcast on French TV this week. And when it’s not drugs, the allegations even extend to secret motors on his bike. To counter the claims, Team Sky released Froome’s usually private personal power data, which showed his work, whilst exceptional, was not abnormal. But it did little to silence the doubters. Of course, there’s a reason many simply refuse to believe they are seeing a clean ride from Froome, and it’s the damage caused by the likes of Lance Armstrong, who lied to so many for so long. That disbelief extends to the fans who line the route. In the last two weeks the race leader says he’s had urine thrown in his face, been verbally abused and even threatened with having his legs broken. It’s prompted the organisers to make a statement appealing for fans to respect the riders, and in particular the yellowjersey. One of Froome’s former team-mates says dominance should not be mistaken for doping. You’re going to make more sacrifices than everybody else. That’s why you’re going to get better. These are my friends, I know how hard they work. It really does upset me when they have such allegations. There may be twists to come in the final two days of perilous mountain climbs, but Froome is so close to victory now he can almost touch it. Silencing the doubters, though remains an uphill task.

That team is now investigating the incident from last night.

Two Met police officers - who told a sexual assault victim they couldn’t arrest her alleged attacker because she needed to report it at a police station - have been given final written warnings. The 36-year-old woman was on a night bus in December when she was attacked. The two officers boarded the bus shortly afterwards - but said they couldn’t deal with the crime. Police released this CCTV image of the alleged attacker. Police in Essex have arrested a 23-year-old man on suspicion of murder after two people died at a house in Stansted. A man in is 60s and a woman in her 50s were found injured but then later died at the scene. The police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the attack. As residential property prices continue to rise across the capital- the cost of office space is also becoming more expensive. The latest figures from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors show that the demand for office space has risen continuously for nearly three years. As Alice Bhandhukravi reports, it’s led to some companies finding new ways of working. Debut connects students with job opportunities. The three employees in moor gate, sharing this building with house thousands much others, no fixed overheads, no long-term contracts. We don’t want to spend 50% of what we earn into office space. Most contracts are for 12 or 21+ months. Including a big commitment for our side. We Work which rents out space is saying that its business model is adaptable to a range of business sectors. In is no wonder that businesses small and large are looking at new ways of working. London is the most expensive office space in the world, higher than Hong Kong and New York. So no short of businesses feeling the strain here in the capital. Sharon McNabb runs a children’s pantomime company. Most people in my business in the last three years have gone bust. They cannot afford the rents or the travel to the spaces to rent. You can find this space in Croydon, Reading but if you incur the travel costs to get you to that place, right? But analysts argue that the commercial rental market is that, and ultimately market forces will dictate. There is enough space in London. We are talking about a market of 250 million square feet, give or take and there is a lot of space that can be developed. So these tennants will move to new locations when outpriced. But they do have a lot of choice. The cranes on London’s skyline give an indication of what is to come, new space is being built but it will not be ready for up to two years. That’s it for now from me. Let’s find out what it is up to with the weather. Ben, it is not looking good is it? There is unseason able wet weather to come. The Met Office warning of the rain to come.

All that will happen is that the rain is going to get heavier, more persistent. There will be lots of surface water and spray. Big puddles and localised flooding. It will be breezy and cold as well. Look at the temperatures. 15 to 19 Celsius at best. If you can bear it, this is the rush hour. The rain getting heavy. The colours on the chart showing a #ru78ble of thunder and turning windy too.
