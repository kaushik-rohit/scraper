2015-12-13,David Cameron is ready to make compromises on key welfare reform demands as his renegotiation of Britain's relationship with the European Union enters a crucial phase.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151213232431/http://news.sky.com/story/1604869/pm-ready-to-compromise-on-welfare-in-eu-talks,"David Cameron is ready to make compromises on key welfare reform demands as his renegotiation of Britain's relationship with the European Union enters a crucial phase. When he meets European leaders this week, the Prime Minister is expected to emphasise that migration is a ""major concern"" for the UK - but that finding a solution that is ""acceptable to all"" is the priority. A number of EU countries have balked at Mr Cameron's plan for a ban on EU migrants claiming in-work benefits until they have been in the UK for four years. The PM is expected to signal during a leaders' dinner in Brussels on Thursday that he is open to other solutions. A Government source said: ""The Prime Minister is set to reiterate the point he made in his letter and speech last month - that what matters most is to fix the problems not the precise form of the arrangements. ""On welfare, he will aim to unlock the political will necessary to find a solution, effectively giving the green light to officials to work up a solution that would both deliver on the Prime Minister's objective of better controlling migration from the EU while also being acceptable to all."" Mr Cameron has accepted that a deal on Britain's renegotiation will not happen at this week's summit, but he hopes to lay the groundwork for a package of reforms to be agreed in February. Labour said the Prime Minister had reduced his bargaining power by failing to build alliances in the EU. Shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn said: ""The Prime Minister has been undone by his own failure to build alliances and goodwill through patient diplomacy. ""He chose to make benefits the centrepiece of his renegotiation, but it was never a good idea to reduce the whole future of our co-operation with Europe, and the jobs, investment, growth, security and influence it has brought us, to just this issue. ""He now needs to get on and make the broader case for remaining part of Europe as Labour has been doing"". A senior source at No 10 told Sky News newspaper reports that Mr Cameron was preparing to back away from or even drop his migrant benefits plan were ""not true""."

Mr Aamer, 48, returned to Britain in October after being held without charge for 13 years at the US military facility in Cuba. During his time in captivity, Mr Aamer's lawyers said he was tortured and held in solitary confinement for 360 days.  In an interview with The Mail on Sunday, the father of four spoke out against extremists: ""How can you give yourself the right to be living here in this country, and living with the people and acting like you are a normal person, and then you just walk in the street and try to kill people?"" He said Islam did not allow the killing of civilians: ""Even if there is a war you cannot kill just anybody, you cannot kill kids, you cannot kill chaplains, you cannot just go in the street and get a knife and start stabbing people. ""If you are that angry about this country, you can get the hell out."" On the rift between Muslim and non-Muslims, he said: ""It helps their (extremists) cause... if you keep looking at people like they are terrorists before they do anything, then you will push them towards violence."" Mr Aamer also said his period of detention will stay with him forever, even though his reunion with his family reunion ""washed away the pain of 14 years"". ""It's always going to be in the back there in my mind, it's going to be sitting there, coming back from time to time,"" he said. ""It's a long period of experience and it can't be just gone."" Mr Aamer was originally detained in Afghanistan in 2001, accused of having links to al Qaeda. He was described in US military files as a ""close associate of Osama bin Laden"" who fought in the battle of Tora Bora. However, Mr Aamer says he was doing charity work and in 2007 the allegations against him were dropped. Mr Aamer is now expected to bring legal proceedings against the UK government over its alleged complicity in his mistreatment."
2015-12-13,The first Briton in space has urged the Government to continue funding human spaceflight so the Union Flag one day flies on Mars.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151213232431/http://news.sky.com/story/1604459/astronaut-calls-for-british-mission-to-mars,"By Thomas Moore, Health and Science Correspondent The first Briton in space has urged the Government to continue funding human spaceflight so the Union Flag one day flies on Mars. Helen Sharman, who was part of a Russian mission 24 years ago, said it was ""better late than never"" for the UK to fund its own return to space. Dr Sharman, now a scientist at Imperial College London, told Sky News: ""The rest of the world is getting on with human space flight. ""We are only dipping our toe into the water. We have only funded Tim Peake to get into space."" Mr Peake will blast off from Kazakhstan on Tuesday for a six-month stint on the International Space Station (ISS). ""The Government will see that human spaceflight is useful - for science and the economy - and inspirational. Britain should definitely be part of a Mars mission,"" Dr Sharman added. Dr Sharman was part of Project Juno, a collaboration between the Soviet space agency and private companies. The Prime Minister at the time, Margaret Thatcher, slashed Britain's space programme and refused to fund astronauts on the grounds that it was unnecessary and uneconomic. Dr Sharman said the decision had held Britain back. She said: ""You can do more science on the ground than you can in space for the same amount of money. But there is some science you can not do on the ground."" It is only in the last five years that the British Government has recognised the economic benefits of space research - with the wide applications of GPS satellite data in navigation, logistics and financial transactions particularly hard to ignore. Britain is now the third-biggest contributor to the European Space Agency and made a £49m contribution to the ISS, paving the way for Mr Peake's mission. Despite the lack of Government funding over recent decades, the commercial space sector has boomed, largely because of telecommunications satellites that beam TV pictures and route phone calls and internet connections. Airbus Space and Defence has built more than 100 satellites in its clean-room facility in Stevenage. Richard Peckham, Airbus's UK Business Development Manager, said the UK had been smart with the money it had. He said: ""We have grown the industry. We have got 6% of global market which is good for an economy of our size. So we are punching above our weight."" Overall the British space sector is now worth £12bn a year and employs 37,000 people.  But it could grow to £40bn by 2030. Britain played a big part in the Rosetta/Philae mission to catch and then land on a comet last year, a triumph that has made scientists even more ambitious. Prof Monica Grady, a space scientist at the Open University, said: ""Britain can do whatever it wants. Nothing can stand in our way. ""The solar system is our oyster - not just the world."""
2015-12-13,"Jeremy Corbyn came under pressure to distance himself from the Stop the War Coalition, as he prepared to attend a fundraising dinner for the group.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151213232431/http://news.sky.com/story/1603728/stop-the-war-coalition-what-you-need-to-know,"By Darren McCaffrey, Politics Reporter Jeremy Corbyn came under pressure to distance himself from the Stop the War Coalition, as he prepared to attend a fundraising dinner for the group. Shadow culture secretary Michael Dugher called on Mr Corbyn to condemn the ""intimidation and abuse"" of those who voted for airstrikes in Syria at the £50-a-head event on Friday evening. The organisation is accused of becoming increasingly anti-Western and militant and has alienated some of its key followers. Former shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt called on the Labour leader not to attend the dinner in protest, but Mr Corbyn, who helped found the group, made his intention to go clear. Mr Dugher then said he should use the occasion to speak to the group about its more recent comments and activities. But who is the Stop the War Coalition - and why so controversial? :: Stop The War To Stop The War Stop the War was established back on 21 September, 2001 in the lead up to the invasion of Afghanistan. Formed to oppose the so-called War on Terror, it had 2,000 supporters who gathered near Kings Cross. The original chair was from the Socialist Workers Party - Lindsey German. :: March, march, march Stop the War organised the largest demonstration against the invasion of Iraq on 15 February, 2003 - with up to 1 million in attendance. Speakers included Tony Benn, Jesse Jackson, Charles Kennedy and playwright Harold Pinter. Protesters widely used the slogan ""Not in my name"", though ultimately the march failed to stop the invasion. :: Losing support Iraq was the high water mark for Stop the War coalition, repeated demonstrations after 7/7, around G20 and most recently in the lead to intervention in Syria. Membership numbers are difficult to come by but certainly the organisation does not hold the influence it once did. :: Controversy Caroline Lucas, who was the vice-president of the organisation, stood down this week after remarks by Stop the War that Paris ""reaped the world wind of western support extremist violence in Middle East"". Commentators have constantly attacked the organisation for alleged pro-Saddam Hussein and pro-Bashar al Assad stand points. And they've organised controversial protests outside Labour MPs houses who have voted for military action in Syria. :: The Corbyn connection Jeremy Corbyn, a long-time supporter of Stop the War, was until recently its chairman. He attended and spoke at a Christmas fundraiser, despite objections from some within his own party - who wanted the Labour leader to distance himself from the organisation. But Mr Corbyn was not for turning, saying Stop the War ""consistently said we need foreign policy that brings about political solutions to desperately complicated problems""."

Geraldine Winner, 77, was putting out rubbish on the evening of 9 October when she was confronted by a woman who beat her with an iron bar and forced her back inside. Her hands and feet were tied and she was blindfolded during the ordeal, as the suspect stole jewellery and other valuables. Mrs Winner suffered serious head wounds and a broken finger. She said she was extremely shaken by the assault and now uncomfortable staying at her home in Knightsbridge. The scene of the attack ""They can take my possessions but they cannot take my memories,"" she said. Detective Chief Inspector Jane Corrigan, from Westminster CID, appealed for information and said the suspect was last seen walking up Kensington High Street. ""Mrs Winner was subjected to an extremely violent attack in her own home by a female suspect. I have never seen an attack of this nature committed by a lone female throughout my policing career. ""The suspect was very specific in terms of the items she was looking for and the motive is still being investigated."" Those items included a heart-shaped diamond pendant, cash including euros and a painting of St Mark's Basilica in Venice by the artist Franz Richard Unterburger. Det Chief Insp Corrigan added: ""The suspect had clearly planned the attack and may have been in the area days or weeks before.  ""This incident has left Mrs Winner feeling vulnerable in her own home and I need the support of public to solve this case. Someone knows this woman."" The suspect is described as white, in her mid 30s, slim build, wearing a dark coat, dark trousers, dark floppy hat and carrying a large bag over her shoulder and a small rucksack on her back. Police believe she was wearing a wig at the time of the attack. Officers previously said a man and woman were involved in the burglary, however a Metropolitan Police spokesman said it has since been established that only one suspect was involved. Mrs Winner, a former dancer, nursed her husband during his battle with liver disease. Winner, who directed the Death Wish movie series and worked as a food critic for The Sunday Times, died aged 77 at his home in January 2013. :: Anyone with information should call Westminster CID on 101.

Thanakorn Siripaiboon was arrested at his home in Samut Prakan province for sharing the doctored photo of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, as well as an infographic on a Thai corruption scandal, with around 600 friends. Under Thai law, anyone convicted of insulting the revered but ailing 88-year-old king can face up to 15 years in jail on each count. ""On December 2, he clicked the 'like' link on a doctored photo of the king and shared it with 608 friends,"" said Colonel Burin Thongprapai, a military junta legal officer.

King Bhumibol Adulyadej is almost revered as a god in Thailand :: Thai Leader's Threat To 'Execute' Journalists Human rights lawyers warned Mr Thanakorn, who belongs to an opposition red-shirt Facebook group, is at risk of becoming another victim of ""enforced disappearance"" in the military-ruled country.

""He is well and in good condition,"" he added. Prosecutions for insulting the king have soared since the army, which calls itself the champion of the monarchy, grabbed power last year. In the last two months, at least two people, including the celebrity fortune teller of the crown prince, have died in custody after being charged with lese majeste. Human Rights Watch said the use of secret military jails has ""now become a new standard nationwide"" under the junta. ""There is nothing at all to guarantee the safety of those held incommunicado in military detention ... without access to their families and lawyers, and interrogated by soldiers without safeguards against mistreatment,"" a spokesman for the group said. Thai Lawyers for Human Rights, who are providing legal help for Mr Thanakorn and his family, said they have ""no idea"" where he is being held and assume he ""has become a victim of enforced disappearance"". The infographic he is accused of sharing is about Rajabhakti Park, a £13m statue-filled park honouring the country's past monarchs. It was built by the army under construction contracts allegedly riddled with bribes and inflated costs. :: Military Rulers Commission Regal Park Last month, a woman handed herself in to police and was charged with sedition for sharing the same graphic. Police said she is still under investigation. Dozens of students were detained in separate incidents earlier this month while trying to visit the park in Hua Hin to draw attention to the scandal. Junta chief Prayut Chan-O-Cha seized power in May 2014 in a coup that toppled the democratically-elected government of Yingluck Shinawatra after months of political chaos. He said the coup was needed to restore order, but critics say the Thai elite wanted to grab power as fears mount over the country's future as the king's reign enters its final years."

Organisers of the protest were expecting large crowds to march on Downing Street, partly because of the high profile support of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Mr Corbyn did not attend the rally, but instead sent a message to be read out on his behalf. On Friday night, he spoke at a fundraising dinner for the Stop The War organisation, declaring it to be ""a vital force at the heart of our democracy"". Jeremy Corbyn spoke at a Stop The War dinner, despite pressure not to He said: ""It has brought hundreds of thousands of people on to the streets time and again. It has organised protests and lobbies in every part of the country, including by military families. ""Most of all, it has been shown to be right in opposing more than a decade of disastrous wars - in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya - while many of its most vociferous critics supported them."" Speakers at Saturday's protest - which finished on Whitehall - lined up to voice their anger at the UK's decision to bomb Syria. One man, who gave his name as Tony, labelled Prime Minister David Cameron as ""insane"" and ""evil"" for pursuing a more aggressive approach. He said: ""You can't bomb your way to peace."" Nancy Taaffe, from the Socialist Party, told the crowd: ""We've been here before people, haven't we?

The Independent Police Complaints Commission, which is investigating the incident in Wood Green on Friday morning, said a firearms officer had reported discharging his weapon during the operation. Analysis of the officer's ammunition has since confirmed that a single shot was fired, and what appears to be a non-police issue firearm was also recovered from the scene. The 28-year-old, who is yet to be formally identified, was killed as police responded to an alleged plot to free convicted criminals from a prison van on its way to Wood Green Crown Court. In a statement, IPCC Commissioner Cindy Butts added: ""I give my assurances that a thorough, independent investigation into the circumstances is under way. My thoughts are with all of those affected by today's events."" The police officers involved in the operation were specialist firearms officers who had not been issued with body cameras. Six men aged between 19 and 32 have been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to facilitate the escape of an individual from custody. Four of the suspects are currently being questioned at separate police stations around London, while the remaining two men have been bailed to a later date in connection with the investigation. They are believed to have been trying to free Izzet Eren, 32, and Erwin Amoah Gyamfi, 29, who were due to be sentenced for aggravated vehicle taking and possession of a firearm. Both of no fixed abode, Eren and Gyamfi were each sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment at Wood Green Crown Court for an attempted ""professional hit"". Their hearing on Friday afternoon had been delayed by the earlier incident.  Sky's Crime Correspondent Martin Brunt said: ""Springing someone from a prisoner van is a complicated matter, you have to be sure which van you are targeting. ""Dozens of people were to appear (at Wood Green Crown Court) this morning ... a good few of them would have been travelling to the court from different prisons. ""The question will arise did the intended target inside the prison van have contact with those who were planning to spring him.""

Mr Lindsay said the ""whole thing"" lasted between 10 and 15 seconds. Scotland Yard confirmed the operation was not related to terrorism. The Metropolitan Police is currently cracking down on gun and knife crime in the capital.

Around 20 prisoners armed with chairs and table legs attacked staff and five inmates barricaded themselves into a cell as specialist warders fought to restore order. Details of the riot at Swinfen Hall prison near Lichfield, Staffordshire, on Thursday have only just emerged. The jail houses 600 long-term young men serving sentences from four years to life. It has a recent history of disturbances, including a riot in August when four prisoners were injured and a fire broke out. The jail was locked down while fire, ambulance and specialist warders dealt with the trouble. A report last year by the prison's independent monitoring board concluded that budget cuts and staff shortages were making it difficult to guarantee the safety of inmates. In the latest disturbance one prison officer suffered a suspected broken jaw, while another had head and face injuries. Others suffered cuts and bruises."

Sky News understands that Lord Rose, the former boss of Marks & Spencer (M&S), is to become chairman‎ of Time Out Markets, a subsidiary of the company which owns the international listings magazine. An announcement about Lord Rose's appointment could be made as soon as next week. Sources said that Oakley Capital, the investment firm which owns Time Out, wants to grow its food markets business beyond its existing site in Lisbon, Portugal. The company wants to open markets in cities including Berlin, Dubai, London, New York‎ and Shanghai, according to a person familiar with the plans. Its first market in Lisbon, the Mercado da Ribeira, features stalls representing dozens of the city's most popular restaurants and food shops, and is said to be performing strongly. A Central London site has been identified, and an announcement about its location is expected in the new year. Oakley bought Time Out in 2010 and soon afterward scrapped the listings magazine‎'s cover-price, resultings in a sharp rise in its circulation. Lord Rose's appointment will add another job to a portfolio which includes the chairmanships of Ocado and Oasis, the dentistry chain. As chairman of Britain Stronger in Europe, he is leading the push for Britain to stay in the UK, ‎with a referendum having been promised by David Cameron by the end of 2017. Lord Rose also holds a number of advisory roles, including at HSBC and Bridgepoint, the private equity firm. Neither Oakley Capital nor Lord Rose‎ could be reached for comment on Saturday."

Two days later, after the extraordinary Government announcement on Heathrow, senior Tories have revealed to Sky News that at that meeting the party's candidate for London mayor ""held a gun"" to David Cameron's head. It's remarkable that in the 15 paragraphs of the Government press notice issued at 7pm after the Cabinet's airports sub-committee met the words ""Heathrow"" and ""Gatwick"" do not appear anywhere. That's because, according to a source close to the Goldsmith mayoral bid team: ""Zac said that if the word Heathrow appeared in the announcement, he'd walk. :: Decision On Airport Expansion Delayed Again ""He effectively held a gun to the PM's head."" That, of course, is a reference to the mayoral candidate's threat to resign his Richmond Park seat and force a by-election if the Government gave the go-ahead for a third runway at Heathrow. A senior London Tory MP verified the Goldsmith threat to ""walk"" and said he had laid down ""red lines"" to the PM. ""That's correct,"" the MP told me. ""But we may not be out of the woods on that one."" When he spoke to journalists at a Parliamentary Press Gallery lunch on Tuesday, Mr Goldsmith said he regretted making his resignation threat, but said he would honour his promise if David Cameron went ahead with ""a betrayal"". ""The VW scandal genuinely changes everything,"" said Mr Goldsmith. ""It means the data on which all of the Airports Commission's assumptions are based is not only flawed, but is known to be fraudulent. ""If the government were to decide to go ahead with the Airports Commission's recommendation now, it would be doing so on the basis of evidence we know is wrong."" In remarks that now explain the Government's cave-in to Mr Goldsmith, the MP told journalists: ""If the government says 'we are going to ask Heathrow and Gatwick to go away and prove to us that, despite all these shenanigans, their proposals can keep us within our legal limits,' that would be a legitimate exercise for the government to do. ""What would not be acceptable would be for the government to say we want to go with Heathrow expansion, but we're not going to sign on the bit of paper for six months, because then it would look like political game playing."" While he said he regretted vowing to resign if Mr Cameron broke his ""no ifs, no buts"" pledge not to expand Heathrow, Mr Goldsmith said he would honour it because ""it's a promise that I made and it’s a promise I'm obliged to keep"". But when he was asked if he would resign as London mayor if a decision was made on Heathrow after he won next year's election, he said: ""It's not a promise that's part of my campaign to be mayor."" Reaction to the Government's announcement could not have been more damning. The condemnation has come from everyone from the Green Party to big business organisations. The Greens' MP, Caroline Lucas, said the delay in making a decision was ""unacceptable"". The Institute of Directors said business leaders were ""tearing their hair out"". The British Chambers of Commerce accused the Government of a ""gutless move"". The manufacturers' organisation, the EEF, said industry was ""fed-up and dismayed by the continued excuses and political dilly dallying"". Labour's candidate for London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said: ""The Government are kicking the decision into the long grass to avoid embarrassing their mayoral candidate."" But now we know it's much more than that. We now know from Tory sources that the announcement is to spare David Cameron's embarrassment - and avoid an embarrassing by-election triggered by his candidate for London mayor."

FX network - which makes the popular series - paid tribute to 43-year-old Rose Siggins on Facebook, saying she was ""beloved by everyone in the AHS family"". ""She was a kind person, a loving mother and a very talented actor. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family and friends at this time,"" said the post. Fans of the show also praised the actress, calling her ""an amazing woman full of strength and determination"". ""Rose you were an inspiration to so many,"" posted Danny Ray Seagraves. ""You showed that a disability could not get you down. Your character was one of my favourites in AHS. May you Rest in Peace."" The actress died in Denver on Saturday and one of her agents, James Mullen, said more details would be released soon. TMZ reported she died after contracting an infection following kidney stone surgery. Siggins was born with rare genetic disorder Sacral Agenesis, which meant her legs were severely deformed. They were amputated when she was two and had prosthetic legs until she was a teenager, when she refused to wear them and turned up for school on a skateboard. She was the first person with her condition to give birth and had two children.

2015-12-13,"Older people needing care are facing a ""bleak future"" because of a lack of funding, a think tank has warned.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151213232431/http://news.sky.com/story/1604649/older-people-needing-care-face-bleak-future,"Older people needing care are facing a ""bleak future"" because of a lack of funding, a think tank has warned. In his Spending Review last month, Chancellor George Osborne announced changes to council tax that he said would lead to a rise in care budgets. But the International Longevity Centre (ILC-UK) has said this would only ""paper over the cracks"" and is not enough to meet the needs of a growing older population. It said around 1.86 million people over the age of 50 in England had unmet care needs - an increase of 7% since the financial crash in 2008. It also said the number of people over 80 had risen by 800,000 in the last decade, and that there were already around 1.5 million people providing over 50 hours a week of unpaid care - often a person's family. :: Missed NHS Targets Spark Winter Pressure Fears The Government said local authorities would have access to an extra £3.5bn for adult social care through the 2% council tax hike announced in the Spending Review. However, ILC-UK said it was ""highly unlikely"" this sum would be raised, and even if it was it would only mean care spending returns to 2015 levels by the end of the Parliament in 2020. Its research, supported by Age UK, also claimed data from 326 local authorities shows council areas where most older people live will be the ones to bring in the least money from Mr Osborne's tax rise plan. The report warns of a ""polarisation"" of care, where some can afford private care and others are increasingly reliant on family or friends to help them. Unlike the NHS, care provided in people's homes or residential centres is not free, and only the poorest get help. Ben Franklin, head of economics of an ageing society at ILC-UK, said: ""The future for adult social care looks bleak. ""The social care settlement will be insufficient to meet the growing care needs of an ageing population and does little more than paper over the cracks which many of those who are in need of care are already falling through."" Caroline Abrahams, charity director of Age UK, said the findings should be a ""wake-up call"", especially for women who make up most family carers. A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said: ""We have given local authorities access to an extra £3.5bn in social care to ensure they can support older and vulnerable people in their area. ""In particular, the increased and improved Better Care Fund will offer support to councils with greater demands for their social care services, on top of the funds they raise through the precept. ""We will continue to work with the care sector to help it to provide quality care for older and vulnerable people."""
2015-12-13,Police have arrested six men from Liverpool as part of an international drugs bust which involved 1.4 tons of compressed cocaine disguised as wooden shipping pallets.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151213232431/http://news.sky.com/story/1604635/brits-arrested-over-cocaine-disguised-as-wood,"Police have arrested six men from Liverpool as part of an international drugs bust which involved 1.4 tons of compressed cocaine disguised as wooden shipping pallets. The drugs arrived on a Colombian ship into the Spanish port of Valencia on 30 November. The shipping container was cracked open and appeared to contain sacks of charcoal loaded onto black wooden pallets. But agents found some sacks actually contained cocaine, and a chemical analysis revealed the 40 pallets were made from compressed cocaine made to look like wood. The UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) said 11 people had been arrested, including two Colombians, two Peruvians and one person from Spain. Four of the Britons were detained in and around the Liverpool area during coordinated raids on 1 December. There was cocaine in some of the sacks The NCA arrested a man, 44, at Liverpool airport, and two others, aged 54 and 50, on the rooftop car park at Belle Vale Shopping Centre. On the same day, Merseyside Police detained another man in Knowsley Village, while a 39-year-old and a 38-year-old were arrested at a luxury apartment in Dubai. The men arrested in Liverpool have been released on bail while more inquiries take place. Authorities in Spain also seized thousands of litres of chemicals at a warehouse - thought to be intended to extract the cocaine. ""We believe the charcoal company was a front for a industrial-sized lab where cocaine was extracted from pallets and charcoal, processed and repackaged for onward distribution across Europe,"" said the NCA's Greg McKenna. The shipment of cocaine was disguised as charcoal and wooden pallets ""This seizure of cocaine, the shutting down of the lab and the eleven arrests will have disrupted criminal activity across the whole of Europe."" Because of Spain's close ties with former colonies in Latin America, it has become an entry point used by drug smugglers bringing cocaine into Europe. Drug syndicates have used increasingly elaborate plans to evade detection in recent years, including hiding cocaine in breast implants, a wig, a plaster cast encasing a man's broken leg, as well as inside a 42-piece crockery set."

The billionaire real estate baron appeared to question the conservative Texas senator's faith and accused him of being in hock to oil donors. His jabs follow reports that Mr Cruz, who has been rising in opinion polls, criticised Mr Trump at a closed-door event. At a town hall rally in Des Moines, Iowa, on Friday evening, Mr Trump took a veiled shot at Mr Cruz's Cuban family background. Describing himself as an evangelical Christian, Mr Trump said: ""I do like Cruz, but not a lot of evangelicals come out of Cuba."" The Establishment's only hope: Trump & me in a cage match. 

Sorry to disappoint -- @realDonaldTrump is terrific. #DealWithIt He also took a swipe at the senator's opposition to ethanol subsidies, which are highly popular in Iowa. ""But I understand it,"" he said, ""oil pays him a lot of money. He's got to be for oil, right?"" The two rivals have been cordial to one another in the race so far, but Mr Trump's remarks could be the opening salvo in the kind of ferocious barrages he has turned on all others. This week the New York Times published an audio recording of Mr Cruz addressing supporters about Mr Trump and Ben Carson, another White House contender. Gallery: Republican Hopefuls: Who's Standing For President? Check out who's still in the hunt for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 ""I believe gravity will bring both of those campaigns down,"" the senator is heard telling the private function. ""The lion's share of their supporters come to us."" Mr Trump subsequently tweeted: ""Looks like Ted Cruz is getting ready to attack. I am leading by so much he must. I hope so, he will fall like all others. Will be easy!"" On Friday, Mr Cruz posted a conciliatory tweet calling Mr Trump ""terrific"". In the first national opinion poll conducted entirely after Mr Trump's recent remarks calling for Muslims to be banned from entering the US, the businessman still held a commanding lead in the race for the November 2016 White House election. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday, he tops the pack with 35% support. Ben Carson was second with 12%, while Mr Cruz was tied with former Florida Governor Jeb Bush on 10%. But a new poll focusing on Iowa, where the first caucus takes place in February, gives Mr Cruz 31% support, a commanding lead over Mr Trump on 21%. The Des Moines Register poll has Ben Carson trailing on 13%, Marco Rubio on 10% and Jeb Bush on 6%. Mr Trump has also hit back at a Saudi royal who called him a ""disgrace"" for his anti-Muslim remarks. The candidate tweeted on Friday: ""Dopey Prince Alwaleed Talal wants to control our US politicians with daddy's money. Can't do it when I get elected."""

The rocket, which is 50 metres long and weighs 300 tons, was hauled by a train on the world's largest industrial railway from the hangar where it has been assembled. It is now in a vertical position on launch pad number one at the Baikonur Cosmodrome, where Yuri Gagarin blasted off in 1961 to become the first human in space. Major Peake will be the second Briton in space after Helen Sharman, but the first to be funded by the UK Government. He will also be the first British astronaut to travel to, and live on board, the International Space Station (ISS) when he starts his six-month mission on Tuesday. Gallery: Tim Peake's Ride To The International Space Station Is Prepared For Lift-Off The Soyuz rocket was assembled at a hangar near the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan Frank de Winne, the head of the European Space Agency's training programme and a former astronaut himself, has admitted to feeling nervous. He told Sky News: ""If it's a really close friend or one of your people and the family is close by it's an emotional moment. You really live with them through this moment."" The Soyuz’s engines will produce 26 million horsepower of thrust, accelerating the three-man crew to 17,500mph in less than nine minutes. Hundreds of rocket tourists have gathered for the launch, including space scientists. Prof Monica Grady, of the Open University, said: ""100% of me would love to be up there. But 100% of me is relieved to be on the ground. ""It’s mixed feelings. I would absolutely love to go into space."" Major Peake will travel with NASA astronaut Tim Kopra and Russian cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko to the ISS. As well as carrying out a series of experiments for the ESA, he will be running science projects designed by children. The crew's mission is titled Principia, after Isaac Newton's ground-breaking Naturalis Principia Mathematica, which describes the principal laws of motion and gravity. The three men are currently in quarantine at Baikonur’s Cosmonaut Hotel, and have been isolated to prevent potentially serious infections from being carried to the ISS. With just two days to go until lift-off, Major Peake has used social media to provide updates on his upcoming trip, and revealed that he will be watching the new Star Wars film on board the ISS. He has also been enjoying tweets of support - including from the 1980s pop band Duran Duran. The group tweeted: ""Lots of luck to you - looking forward to following your progress in space."" The astronaut responded by saying: ""How cool? A message from the awesome @duranduran - thanks guys!! Escaping #PlanetEarth shortly #spacerocks."""
2015-12-13,Three men who smuggled drugs worth up to £1.2bn into the UK using fake ambulances have been jailed for a combined total of 70 years.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151213232431/http://news.sky.com/story/1604342/gang-behind-1-2bn-ambulance-drug-plot-jailed,"Three men who smuggled drugs worth up to £1.2bn into the UK using fake ambulances have been jailed for a combined total of 70 years. Olof Schoon, who established a bogus company to transport the ""truly colossal"" amounts of Class A drugs in a fleet of specially adapted vehicles, was sentenced to 24 years - and was told by the judge his sentence would have been longer if he had not pleaded guilty last month. His ""right-hand man"", Leonardus Bijlsma, was convicted by a jury and jailed for 28 years for his role in the plot. The court heard how the 55-year-old had used rivet guns to conceal drugs behind panels, in cupboards and under the floors of the Dutch vehicles. And Richard Engelsbel, who admitted to acting as a driver or driver's mate on 25 of the smuggling trips, where the ambulances pretended to pick up injured patients, received an 18-year jail term. Over 14 months, the group of three men - all from Amsterdam - delivered drugs to dealers in London, Yorkshire, the West Midlands and Merseyside. As part of the sophisticated scheme, the contraband was marked with different coloured tape, which corresponded to a list of 20 customers found inside one of the ambulances. CCTV showed members of the gang travelling with a bogus patient on crutches When the smuggling gang were arrested near Birmingham on 16 June, a stash of high-purity cocaine and heroin with a wholesale value of about £10m was uncovered from secret compartments inside their nearby vehicle. A fourth man who was driving the ambulance at the time, Dennis Vogelaar, was found not guilty. Sentencing the trio at Birmingham Crown Court, Judge Francis Laird QC said he was satisfied Schoon, a father-of-three, had played a ""leading role"" in putting together a team of conspirators - adding that the mastermind had kept records and invoices just like a legitimate business. That paperwork gave the impression that the company's income came from insurance companies who had paid out on policies covering travellers for accidents and illnesses. The judge added: ""Having heard evidence over a number of days, I am satisfied this was a highly sophisticated, meticulously planned and well-executed conspiracy involving the importation of Class A drugs on a truly colossal scale."" Following their arrests, further investigation by the National Crime Agency revealed that 44 smuggling trips had been made using ferries connecting the Hook of Holland and Harwich, as well as Rotterdam and Hull. CCTV of one of the drug runs showed them arriving in an ambulance with a bogus patient on crutches - who was later seen walking around unaided. Andy Young, a specialist prosecutor in the CPS organised crime division, said after the sentencing: ""In pursuit of profit, the defendants ignored the enormous cost of human life that comes with importing these drugs. ""The quantities are staggering - the last trip along involved nearly 270kg of drugs."""

Some 23 people were killed in the tragedy More than 440 firefighters and emergency workers spent around three hours bringing the fire under control. It was not immediately clear what triggered the blaze. The fire was the latest tragedy to hit a psychiatric institution in Russia, where outdated Soviet-era infrastructure is still in widespread use. A fire at a psychiatric hospital in northwest Russia in September 2013 left 37 people dead while another blaze in April of the same year killed 38.

London's premier share index shed 135 points or 2.2% during trading on Friday, to close at 5,952. It equated to a loss, in value terms, of £34bn on Friday alone following a week of woe that saw the FTSE lose ground each day - spelling further bad news for pension pots and other investments. All eyes were on Brent crude, which fell as much as 4.5% during afternoon trading to $37.9 a barrel - driven by an International Energy Agency prediction that the record glut in oil stocks could last until late next year. Investors were also looking ahead to next week, when the US Federal Reserve (Fed) is widely expected to raise interest rates for the first time in nine years despite international concerns about the impact. Such a move would likely strengthen the dollar further and depress the cost of commodities, such as oil, even more as they are priced in dollars. Another knock-on effect would be to raise the cost of servicing the debts of many emerging market economies - denting their growth efforts. The FTSE fallers were dominated by their exposure to commodities in the mining-heavy index but were actually led by the asset management firm, Old Mutual. It lost more than 10% of its value for the second day running on the back of political turmoil in South Africa, where much of its business is based. The rand sank to a record low against the dollar after President Jacob Zuma sacked his finance minister. There were wider fears for the global economy evident across European trading, with traders citing weakness in China's currency, the yuan. The DAX in Germany closed 2.4% lower while in New York, the S&P 500 was 1.6% down mid-way through its final session of the week. Stocks to suffer in London on Friday included Anglo American, down 8.1%, and BHP Billiton which lost more than 5%. The FTSE started the year at 6,566 and is currently 9.1% worse off. David Buik, market commentator at Panmure Gordon, said: ""Understandable correction waited in the wings in the early weeks of 2015 when oil dropped from $65 a barrel to $52. ""But then the FTSE 100, on reasonable earnings and no logical alternative asset class competition ploughed its way to a record 7104 at the end of April. But it never had the legs or the conviction to push on. ""Soon warning bells in the shape of distress signals affecting growth in China threatened a meltdown. Oil prices continued to recede; that rattled the market’s confidence. ""Add to that ridiculous unsubstantiated threats from the Fed to raise interest rates, which made for a very strong dollar, thus trashing emerging markets brought about a change in sentiment. ""Investors suddenly realised that stock markets were not delivering growth, triggering a fall in the FTSE 100 to 5900 in August."" He cited the ""dramatic cut"" in resource prices since for helping take the mining sector down by an average 65% in 2015 to date."

Nadir Syed, 22, planned to carry out an execution in London last year in a bid to copy Lee Rigby's brutal killing, Woolwich Crown Court heard. Jurors were told Syed - inspired by an Islamic State fatwa - was obsessed with the murder of Fusilier Rigby, who was hacked to death by two extremists in Woolwich in 2013. Syed was fixated by violence and knives and ""unnaturally interested in murders and beheadings"", his six-week trial heard. He was obsessed with IS propaganda and shared violent footage of beheadings from Syria and Iraq on social media, the court was told. He had tried to leave for Syria in January last year but was stopped at the airport because he was on bail.  The court was also told Syed wrote a message which said: ""Wearing a poppy supports murdering terrorist."" A video clip filmed on a mobile phone showed Syed laughing as he stamped on a paper poppy in the street. Prosecutor Max Hill QC said the action was demonstrative of his ""attitude to the poppy as the remembrance image in this country"". Syed was arrested on 6 November last year - shortly after buying a blade, the court heard. He told police he went to buy knives for his mother because ""she was complaining about the state of the knives in her kitchen"". Dressed in a burgundy sweatshirt and wearing an Islamic skull cap, he showed no reaction in court as he was convicted. His sentencing date is to be confirmed. The jury was unable to reach verdicts on Haseeb Hamayoon, 28, and Yousaf Syed, 20, and a retrial has been ordered. Hamayoon and Yousaf Syed deny preparing acts of terrorism. Commander Richard Walton, head of the Met's Counter Terrorism Command, said the ""intense and lengthy operation"" had been supported by the intelligence agencies. ""I have no doubt that London is a safer place today with this conviction,"" he said. ""We continue to appeal to those in the Muslim community to talk to us about anyone they know who is demonstrating an extremist mindset linked to ISIL."""

Pastor James McConnell, 78, denies two charges relating to a sermon he preached at his church last year. Belfast Magistrates Court was told he had described Islam as ""satanic"", ""heathen"" and ""a doctrine spawned in hell"". Pastor McConnell was supported at court by members of his congregation The trial began with gospel music ringing through the Belfast courtroom, where a DVD recording of the entire service in May 2014 was played. He was questioned by police shortly after the church service, but no action was taken. However, because the sermon had been streamed online, he now faces two charges under the Communications Act (2003). In a landmark case, he is charged with improper use of a public electronic communications network and causing a grossly offensive message to be sent by means of a public electronic communications network. On arrival at court, he said it was ""a good day for a hanging, particularly to hang the prosecutors"". Around 100 of his congregation packed the public gallery. They greeted him with applause while others sang hymns outside. In his opening speech, prosecutor David Russell said the decision to proceed with the case was ""proportionate and necessary"". He said the pastor ""characterises the followers of an entire religion in a stereotypical way and that's grossly offensive and that’s not protected from saying it in a pulpit"". ""It has nothing to do with religion or freedom of expression of his freedom to preach,"" he added. The prosecution said they would present extracts from radio and television interviews the pastor had given as circumstantial evidence. The court was told that in a prepared statement given to police during interview, Pastor McConnell said he had not intended to cause offence, insult, arouse fear or stir up tension. The defence intends calling an MP, a Catholic priest and an Imam to give evidence on the pastor's behalf. Dr Al-Hussaini, a Muslim cleric from London, says he does not agree with what Pastor McConnell said but defends his right to say it. Pastor McConnell, who strenuously denies the charges, faces up to six months in prison if convicted."

Egypt, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Malaysia, Pakistan and several Gulf Arab and African states make up the coalition, a statement said. The joint statement published on state news agency SPA said: ""The countries here mentioned have decided on the formation of a military alliance led by Saudi Arabia to fight terrorism, with a joint operations centre based in Riyadh to coordinate and support military operations."" The announcement said there was ""a duty to protect the Islamic nation from the evils of all terrorist groups and organisations whatever their sect and name which wreak death and corruption on earth and aim to terrorise the innocent."" Iran, a mainly Shia Islam country, was absent from the list.  :: Analysis - Saudi Coalition Could Lead To Greater Conflict It is Sunni Saudi Arabia's rival for influence in the Arab world and has been accused of backing one of the groups involved in fighting in Yemen, a conflict that also involves Saudi Arabia. A different Saudi-led coalition that is supporting Yemen's internationally recognised government said on Monday night that a planned truce with the country's Shia rebels has been postponed for 12 hours. Saudi Arabia's defence minister said that the coalition will not just confront Islamic State, but ""any terrorist group in front of us"". He added that the coalition will coordinate with the major world powers and international organisations, according to Reuters. There was no initial word from any of the other countries involved. The United States has been keen to see Gulf Arab states doing more to aid the military campaign against Islamic State. The announcement of the coalition comes after Saudi Arabia succeeded in bringing Syria's disparate opposition groups to the negotiating table. Syrian President Bashar al Assad remains opposed to negotiating with groups that he sees as terrorists but there are hopes that Russia may force him to make concessions.  On Tuesday, US Secretary of State John Kerry will travel to Moscow to meet with his opposite number Sergei Lavrov and Mr Putin himself to try to extract from them an agreement that while Mr Assad should probably go, much of his regime could be preserved."

There has been a 76% fall in the number of resident and regular migrant butterflies over the past 40 years, according to a joint report by charities Butterfly Conservation and the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH). The cleverly camouflaged small Heath butterfly Numbers have fallen across Europe as a whole but the UK - and southern England in particular - has been worst affected. It is not clear what has caused the fall but experts suggest the ""varied"" effects of climate change, deterioration of suitable habitats and increased use of herbicides and pesticides may have played their part. The predicament was one that ""should shame us all"", said Butterfly Conservation vice-president Chris Packham. ""As a society we are guilty of standing idly by as once common species, never mind the rarities, suffer staggering declines. ""We are finally facing the meltdown that was coming all along. ""There is a very, very urgent need to understand the reasons for the decline, which are likely to be complex."" Mr Packham added: ""Climate change has had a significant impact - some of the migrant species are increasing, because of milder winters and warmer, wetter springs. However, the bread and butter of British butterflies are not benefiting."" Once common species such as the Wall, Essex Skipper and Small Heath are now among the scarcer types of butterfly in the UK and the Gatekeeper - once one of the country's most widely seen butterflies - has suffered a 44% drop over the past decade. Increased agricultural farming, including the decline of flower-rich meadows, removal of hedgerows and increased nitrogen being released into the environment, is believed to have had an impact on numbers. The report, The State of the UK's Butterflies 2015, warns that climate change has had ""much more varied, subtle and worrying impacts on butterflies than had previously been realised"". Warmer temperatures are attracting more foreign butterflies to Britain's shores, with populations of common migrant species - the Clouded Yellow, Red Admiral and Painted Lady - showing a dramatic increase since the 1970s. There is some hope, however, with the organisation saying that, despite the gloomy situation in general, the recording and monitoring of the UK's butterflies has ""never been stronger"". Data from the past 10 years is showing a more positive trend, the report said, as continuing intensive conservation efforts produce a ""breakthrough"" effect."

Jermaine Baker, 28, was killed by a single shot during an operation to foil an alleged attempt to spring two convicts from a prison van. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said it has launched a criminal homicide investigation. This could see the officer face murder or manslaughter charges over Mr Baker's death, which happened near Wood Green Crown Court. The Metropolitan Police on Monday said they had agreed to the IPCC suggestion that the firearms officer be suspended amid the investigation. But Scotland Yard said on Tuesday the officer would be taken off duty - technically not a suspension. Met Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Peter Terry said: ""The exact circumstances that led to Mr Baker's death must be thoroughly and independently examined. That is the role of the IPCC.  ""It is only through establishing the full facts, as quickly as possible, as to what took place that day that the best interests of justice and of all those affected can be served. The shooting happened near Wood Green Crown Court ""As this is an ongoing investigation we must all await the IPCC's findings before drawing any conclusions or speculating on what has taken place. ""All of our firearms officers, who are all volunteers, do a job that is difficult and often dangerous. They all fully understand, quite rightly, that they will need to account for their actions if they use lethal force.""  In a statement the IPCC said: ""The Independent Police Complaints Commission has launched a homicide investigation into Mr Baker's death. ""The launch of a criminal investigation does not mean that criminal charges will necessarily follow."" The IPCC stressed the criminal investigation is at a very early stage, and it may be decided that no criminal charges are brought. Meanwhile, four men have appeared at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court over the alleged plot to free the two convicts. Nathan Mason, Gokay Sogucakli, Ozcan Eren and Eren Hasyer were arrested following the police operation. Izzet Eren, 32, and Erwin Amoyaw-Gyamfi, 29, were later jailed for 14 years each at Wood Green Crown Court for firearms and driving offences. Ozcan Eren, 31, of Wood Green, and Hasyer, 25, of Enfield, are charged with conspiracy to aid the escape of the two prisoners. Mason, 30, and Sogucakli, 18, both of Tottenham, face the same charge, as well as possessing an imitation firearm and using a motor vehicle taken without the owner's consent. The four were remanded in custody to appear next at Wood Green Crown Court on 4 January."
2015-12-15,"Actress Phyllida Law, mother of Oscar-winner Emma Thompson, has described how looking after a mother with dementia left her feeling isolated.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151215152149/http://news.sky.com/story/1605986/actress-describes-burden-of-mothers-dementia,"Actress Phyllida Law, mother of Oscar-winner Emma Thompson, has described how looking after a mother with dementia left her feeling isolated. The 83-year-old, who appeared in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, looked after her mother Meg for several years while she had the disease. She spoke as Alzheimer's Research UK released a report on the impact of dementia on the people who care for sufferers. The charity estimates there are 700,000 people in the UK who act as primary carers for those with dementia.  More than a fifth give up work or reduce their hours and one third have no access to respite care, the Alzheimer's Society said. Law, who has also won an Olivier Award, said she felt under strain while caring for her mother as the degenerative disease took hold. She said: ""The night time was particularly difficult: at dusk my mother would often think she was in the wrong house, or she would call for breakfast in the middle of the night, not knowing what time it was. ""When you're worn out because you haven't slept, you can be in danger of losing your temper, and that's very hard. ""I wasn't as isolated as some people, and I was lucky because I had help from the people in my mother's village and from my two daughters, who also helped me financially. ""But caring for ma, you couldn't leave the house without taking her with you, so you did feel very stuck a lot of the time."" Alzheimer's Research UK's report, Dementia in the Family: The Impact On Carers, comes after a study by the International Longevity Centre found that the UK is heading for the bottom of the OECD league table for spending on care. Meanwhile, a poll carried out by Alzheimer's Research UK found that nearly a third (31%) of non-retired people aged 55 and over are worried that family members will have to care for them in later life. The report revealed how those looking after family members with dementia can become socially isolated and can find it difficult to cope. The charity said that much work is still needed into dementia but if the onset of the disease could be delayed by five years, the number of carers needed by 2050 would be cut by a third. Hilary Evans, chief executive of Alzheimer's Research UK, said: ""For many people the festive season is a time to think about family, but for countless families across the UK dementia is taking a heavy toll, leaving people socially isolated and struggling financially. ""The experiences highlighted in this report will be recognised by people up and down the country who are dealing with the challenges of caring for a loved one with dementia."""

The event brought Hollywood Boulevard to a halt as the first screenings of the seventh film in the franchise were held simultaneously at three cinemas. The new droid BB-8  was one of the first characters to appear in front of the cameras on the red carpet. The football-shaped droid has been a popular fixture in trailers, and it was soon joined by series mainstays C-3PO and R2-D2. JJ Abrams pays tribute to Star Wars creator George Lucas British newcomers Gwendoline Christie and Daisy Ridley were among the first human stars to arrive at the premiere which is one of the biggest LA has seen in years. Other early arrivals included Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca) who stepped out of his car with the help of a lightsaber cane and posed for photographs with Anthony Daniels, who plays C-3PO in the films. Christie and Ridley portray the evil Captain Phasma and Rey, two new characters who will be expected to carry the Star Wars franchise as it is introduced to a new generation. The film also sees the characters Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Han Solo reuniting for the first time on the big screen since 1983's Return Of The Jedi. Harrison Ford, who plays Solo, arrived at the Dolby Theatre with his wife Calista Flockhart. He said making a Star Wars movie now is a far cry from making one in the 1970s. ""In the 70s nobody knew what to anticipate, nobody had seen anything like it, now we have to live up to what the first films delivered,"" he said. But he said he did not feel too much pressure: ""It's not my fault, we can blame it on JJ. I just work here,"" he said. Hamill described being back as Skywalker after 30 years as ""surreal"". Contemplating how she returned to her role as Princess Leia, Carrie Fisher said: ""I asked young Carrie Fisher what it was like to be younger but she ignored me. She was out partying to make sure I could look like s**t later."" Gallery: Carrie Fisher Keeps Crowds Entertained Carrie Fisher's exuberant behaviour at the premiere of The Force Awakens kept the crowds entertained. Here we take a look at her many different faces Star Wars creator George Lucas was spotted laughing and chatting with director and co-writer JJ Abrams. Lucas has already seen the movie and has reportedly given it his seal of approval. He said: ""It's a film about families and what one generation leaves behind another generation has to deal with. ""I started off wanting to do a film for young people who were going through adolescence, with mythological themes and spiritual themes. That is what resonated with people."" Abrams was overwhelmed by the reception: ""It's very surreal. I've never seen this kind of thing. ""It's insane. I feel enormously guilty for this community, this neighbourhood,"" he told starwars.com. Security around the site was high, with metal detectors screening pedestrians and police dogs checking the area. For those without tickets to the premiere, the most they could see was the outside of the tent. ""We're really disappointed because we are big Star Wars fans, and we were hoping to at least see a little of the celebrities,"" said Natalie Arnet, a tourist from Paris. The Force Awakens opens in the UK on Thursday and on Friday in the US. The film has already made box office history in England, where it has sold more than half a million tickets for its opening week at one cinema chain alone. :: Is The Force With You?

They are among 50 who have come forward to accuse the actor of sexually assaulting them after plying them with drugs and alcohol. In the countersuit, filed in US district court in Springfield, Massachusetts, Cosby says the seven lied when they made their accusations. His suit is in response to lawsuits filed by all seven women charging him with libel, assault and slander and seeking unspecified financial damages. The 78-year-old, best known for his role in the 1980s television hit The Cosby Show, has repeatedly denied doing anything wrong and has never been criminally charged. Many of the assaults he is alleged to have committed occurred decades ago so the statute of limitations for prosecuting them has elapsed. The countersuit contends that the women defamed his ""honourable legacy and reputation"" by accusing him of sexual misconduct. It says: ""Relying solely on unsubstantiated accusations, counterclaim defendants have engaged in a campaign to assassinate Mr Cosby's reputation and character by willfully, maliciously, and falsely accusing Mr Cosby of multi-decade-old purported sexual misconduct."" It charges the women with defamation, tortious interference and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The women's lawsuits were first filed in December 2014. Gloria Allred, who represents several other women suing the comedian, said: ""Such a tactic will not deter courageous women from fighting the battle against him."" The cases are all ongoing."

Daniel Jones, 60, would speak to his terrier dog Rocket as if it were human and he was obsessed with crime and personal fitness, his friend of 30 years, Carl Wood, told Woolwich Crown Court. Wood said: ""Danny is a very sensitive guy, a very funny man, eccentric to extremes. Everyone who knew Danny would say he was mad. He would go to bed in his mother's dressing gown with a fez on."" He continued: ""He would read palms, tell people he could read their fortunes - bit of a Walter Mitty. The heist is described as the largest in English history, at £14m ""Danny was studying crime all the time in his room; reading books about it, watch films and go on the internet."" Wood is charged with conspiracy to commit burglary, and one count of conspiracy to convert, conceal or transfer criminal property. The 58-year-old, from Hertfordshire, told the jury he often spoke to Jones on the phone to arrange walks together as they shared a mutual interest in fitness. But prosecuting lawyers allege that during the calls the pair plotted to break into the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Company over the Easter bank holiday weekend. Referring to a call in early January, Nick Corsellis, defending, asked: ""Were you discussing the planning of the largest burglary in English history?"" Wood replied: ""No I was not. If I wasn't going on a walk, generally I was visiting my mum, with my wife or my children, or in the vicinity of my house. My life never changed other than that."" Wood told the court he knew Jones was obsessed with crime, but that they never discussed this. ""He would tell me from time to time what he had been up to, but I never asked,"" he said. Jones, Brian Reader, John ""Kenny"" Collins and Terry Perkins, have pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit burglary. An eighth man, Hugh Doyle, of Enfield, is jointly charged with them on one count of conspiracy to conceal, convert or transfer criminal property. The trial continues."

The case was dubbed the ""war on terrier"" after the actress was accused of failing to declare the animals and put them in quarantine. The incident hit the headlines when the animals, Pistol and Boo, were threatened with death by Australia's agriculture minister Barnaby Joyce unless they ""buggered off back to the United States"". Heard faces two counts of knowingly importing a prohibited product in breach of the Quarantine Act. The trial was set down for 18 April at Southport Magistrates Court on the Gold Coast in Queensland with a court official telling AFP the actress was required to appear at the hearing. Depp and Heard at The Danish Girl LA premiere in November After the incident, Heard vowed never to return to Australia, although reports earlier this month said she ""respected Australia's laws"" and was looking forward to ""attending the hearing of these matters"". Twelve witnesses are listed to give evidence but it is not known whether Depp is one of them. The animals, which had allegedly travelled by private jet to Queensland, where Depp was filming Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, were quickly whisked out of the country as the story hit the headlines. Under strict Australian laws designed to keep disease at bay, dogs entering from the US must be declared and have to spend 10 days in quarantine. Penalties for contravening the Quarantine Act range from fines to a maximum of 10 years in prison for the worst cases. Heard is currently promoting The Danish Girl which she stars in with Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander."

Asked if he agreed with Republican front-runner Donald Trump that Europe, and in particular London, has a ""Muslim problem"", the retired neurosurgeon said: ""I guess it depends on what Europe wants, I guess it depends what London wants. ""Are they happy with a society where there are multiple Sharia courts and enclaves of people who perhaps have a different way of living and a different standard of living."" After being criticised for an interview in which he suggested there were ""radicalised"" no-go areas of London and Paris where police were afraid to go, Mr Trump tweeted that the UK ""is trying hard to disguise their massive Muslim problem"". ""Everybody is wise to what is happening, very sad! Be honest,"" he wrote on 10 December. Asked if he thinks no-go zones exist in London, Dr Carson - who has slipped in the polls recently - replied: ""If they want that, that's not a problem. Yes they exist, of course. ""I don't know if you can go there or not, but they are certainly places that have a different way of life."" When asked what if he thinks should be done to deal with such areas, he said: ""It depends on what people in that country want. ""It's sort of like you may remember a few years ago in Australia when the prime minister said, 'Look, people wanna come here from other places, and I understand that, it's a nice place. We love it and we love our culture, and if you wanna come here and assimilate to our culture, you're welcome. If you don't, there are other places you can go'. And that was the philosophy, and that turned out to be a very popular philosophy. ""If London wants that, if England wants that, they ought to make that declaration. If they don't want that and they're quite willing to change - that's fine too."" Mr Trump's comments about London being ""so radicalised that the police are afraid for their own lives"" drew a sharp rebuke from Scotland Yard, which said he ""could not be more wrong"". ""Any candidate for the presidential election in the United States of America is welcome to receive a briefing from the Met Police on the reality of policing London,"" it said. London Mayor Boris Johnson said Mr Trump's ""ill-informed comments"" were ""complete and utter nonsense"". Mr Trump also drew global condemnation after calling for Muslims to be banned from entering the US in the wake of the terrorist attack in San Bernadino. Amid the furore, an online petition calling for Mr Trump to be banned from the UK has become the most popular ever on the Government's website. For his part, Dr Carson is known for having less-than-mainstream views: he thinks the pyramids were built to store grain, that the Holocaust could have been prevented if Jews had guns and that Obamacare is worse than slavery. He also told his wide-ranging interview with Sky News that despite the climate change deal in Paris, the issue would not be his priority if he was President. ""It would not be the overarching driver of my policies. There's always been change going on,"" he said."

It comes after an Australian court ordered the company to stop selling several versions of the painkiller, which it ruled were identical to its standard pills, but nearly twice as expensive. Nurofen Back Pain, Period Pain, Migraine Pain and Tension Headache Products are in fact identical and the firm has ""engaged in misleading conduct"" by labelling them for different ailments, the Federal Court ruled. The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has now confirmed it is investigating 12 complaints about a television advert for Nurofen Express. The watchdog is examining whether the advert was misleading because it implies that the product directly targets muscles in the head. An ASA spokesman said: ""We received the complaints in February and launched an investigation in March. ""This is a complex case and our investigation is ongoing. ""The advertiser is providing evidence to substantiate its claims, we're carefully assessing that and we'll publish our findings in due course."" A spokeswoman for Nurofen said the Australian court ruling did not affect its UK products and they would continue to be available. Dr Aomesh Bhatt, the company's medical affairs director said: ""The Nurofen specific-pain range was launched with an intention to help consumers navigate their pain relief options, particularly within the grocery environment where there is no healthcare professional to assist decision making."" In October, a Sky News investigation found branded pills that claim to target pain can cost up to four times more than unbranded tablets."

Two days later, after the extraordinary Government announcement on Heathrow, senior Tories have revealed to Sky News that at that meeting the party's candidate for London mayor ""held a gun"" to David Cameron's head. It's remarkable that in the 15 paragraphs of the Government press notice issued at 7pm after the Cabinet's airports sub-committee met the words ""Heathrow"" and ""Gatwick"" do not appear anywhere. That's because, according to a source close to the Goldsmith mayoral bid team: ""Zac said that if the word Heathrow appeared in the announcement, he'd walk. :: Decision On Airport Expansion Delayed Again ""He effectively held a gun to the PM's head."" That, of course, is a reference to the mayoral candidate's threat to resign his Richmond Park seat and force a by-election if the Government gave the go-ahead for a third runway at Heathrow. A senior London Tory MP verified the Goldsmith threat to ""walk"" and said he had laid down ""red lines"" to the PM. ""That's correct,"" the MP told me. ""But we may not be out of the woods on that one."" When he spoke to journalists at a Parliamentary Press Gallery lunch on Tuesday, Mr Goldsmith said he regretted making his resignation threat, but said he would honour his promise if David Cameron went ahead with ""a betrayal"". ""The VW scandal genuinely changes everything,"" said Mr Goldsmith. ""It means the data on which all of the Airports Commission's assumptions are based is not only flawed, but is known to be fraudulent. ""If the government were to decide to go ahead with the Airports Commission's recommendation now, it would be doing so on the basis of evidence we know is wrong."" In remarks that now explain the Government's cave-in to Mr Goldsmith, the MP told journalists: ""If the government says 'we are going to ask Heathrow and Gatwick to go away and prove to us that, despite all these shenanigans, their proposals can keep us within our legal limits,' that would be a legitimate exercise for the government to do. ""What would not be acceptable would be for the government to say we want to go with Heathrow expansion, but we're not going to sign on the bit of paper for six months, because then it would look like political game playing."" While he said he regretted vowing to resign if Mr Cameron broke his ""no ifs, no buts"" pledge not to expand Heathrow, Mr Goldsmith said he would honour it because ""it's a promise that I made and it’s a promise I'm obliged to keep"". But when he was asked if he would resign as London mayor if a decision was made on Heathrow after he won next year's election, he said: ""It's not a promise that's part of my campaign to be mayor."" Reaction to the Government's announcement could not have been more damning. The condemnation has come from everyone from the Green Party to big business organisations. The Greens' MP, Caroline Lucas, said the delay in making a decision was ""unacceptable"". The Institute of Directors said business leaders were ""tearing their hair out"". The British Chambers of Commerce accused the Government of a ""gutless move"". The manufacturers' organisation, the EEF, said industry was ""fed-up and dismayed by the continued excuses and political dilly dallying"". Labour's candidate for London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said: ""The Government are kicking the decision into the long grass to avoid embarrassing their mayoral candidate."" But now we know it's much more than that. We now know from Tory sources that the announcement is to spare David Cameron's embarrassment - and avoid an embarrassing by-election triggered by his candidate for London mayor."

The former Pop Idol judge had always denied the 10 allegations, which related to six women. He broke down in tears as the verdict was read out at Westminster Magistrates' Court in London. Speaking outside, his voice cracking, he thanked friends and former colleagues who had ""lifted me up when I was falling down"". ""It has been a long, hard and stressful 14 months - and a lot has been said and written about me in that time that over the next few days, weeks and months will need to be addressed and rectified,"" said Fox. With his wife Vicky standing beside him, he told her: ""I cannot begin to tell you how much I love you and how much I thank you for simply being there and holding my hand through this long and arduous journey."" He added: ""Thanks for all the amazing support as well that I've had from listeners and the wider public who have been so very kind during this period. Fox told his wife: 'Thank you for simply being there and holding my hand' ""I can't wait to be broadcasting again and to resume that relationship."" The 54-year-old DJ, who was the voice behind chart and breakfast shows on Capital FM, spent the last decade at Magic FM before he was suspended following his arrest in September last year. The radio station's owner Bauer Media said it has yet to make a decision on Mr Fox's future following his acquittal. In a statement, the firm said: ""We will be taking some time to reflect on the outcome of the trial and we have no further comment to make at this stage."" The charges against the DJ had included allegations from former young fans and ex-workmates - their allegations spanned 1988 through to 2014. The star was accused of forcibly kissing two teenage fans, aged 14 and 15, in the 1990s. One woman, who was 15 at the time, claimed he forced his tongue down her throat when she met the star at a radio roadshow at Chessington World of Adventures. Former colleagues also accused him of crossing the line while working at radio stations.   Giving evidence in his defence earlier this month, Fox told the court he encouraged ""non-stop banter"" on his radio shows but he denied ever acting inappropriately. He said: ""It was normal office banter, some saucy, cheeky, slightly over the top, some boring and mundane, like 'did your Ocado arrive last night'? ""It was all in short bursts. There was lots of horseplay in a fun way, piggyback rides, pinches, squeezing - general banter. I hate that word because it has been used over the last couple of weeks, but there was chit-chat, banter."" The DJ who began his career in local radio went on to host the Pepsi chart show for many years before becoming a judge on Pop Idol alongside Simon Cowell, Nikki Chapman and Pete Waterman. Fox, who lives in Fulham, west London, with his wife and three children has been off air since his initial arrest."

Shadow culture secretary Michael Dugher called on Mr Corbyn to condemn the ""intimidation and abuse"" of those who voted for airstrikes in Syria at the £50-a-head event on Friday evening. The organisation is accused of becoming increasingly anti-Western and militant and has alienated some of its key followers. Former shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt called on the Labour leader not to attend the dinner in protest, but Mr Corbyn, who helped found the group, made his intention to go clear. Mr Dugher then said he should use the occasion to speak to the group about its more recent comments and activities. But who is the Stop the War Coalition - and why so controversial? :: Stop The War To Stop The War Stop the War was established back on 21 September, 2001 in the lead up to the invasion of Afghanistan. Formed to oppose the so-called War on Terror, it had 2,000 supporters who gathered near Kings Cross. The original chair was from the Socialist Workers Party - Lindsey German. :: March, march, march Stop the War organised the largest demonstration against the invasion of Iraq on 15 February, 2003 - with up to 1 million in attendance. Speakers included Tony Benn, Jesse Jackson, Charles Kennedy and playwright Harold Pinter. Protesters widely used the slogan ""Not in my name"", though ultimately the march failed to stop the invasion. :: Losing support Iraq was the high water mark for Stop the War coalition, repeated demonstrations after 7/7, around G20 and most recently in the lead to intervention in Syria. Membership numbers are difficult to come by but certainly the organisation does not hold the influence it once did. :: Controversy Caroline Lucas, who was the vice-president of the organisation, stood down this week after remarks by Stop the War that Paris ""reaped the world wind of western support extremist violence in Middle East"". Commentators have constantly attacked the organisation for alleged pro-Saddam Hussein and pro-Bashar al Assad stand points. And they've organised controversial protests outside Labour MPs houses who have voted for military action in Syria. :: The Corbyn connection Jeremy Corbyn, a long-time supporter of Stop the War, was until recently its chairman. He attended and spoke at a Christmas fundraiser, despite objections from some within his own party - who wanted the Labour leader to distance himself from the organisation. But Mr Corbyn was not for turning, saying Stop the War ""consistently said we need foreign policy that brings about political solutions to desperately complicated problems""."

2015-12-15,A fund has been created to help the children of Jonah Lomu after it emerged he died with almost no savings.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151215152149/http://news.sky.com/story/1605909/all-black-legend-jonah-lomu-died-penniless,"A fund has been created to help the children of Jonah Lomu after it emerged he died with almost no savings. The New Zealand Rugby Players' Association has established the Jonah Lomu Legacy Trust to provide for the legendary winger's two sons, Brayley and Dhyreille. Association chief executive Rob Nichol said Lomu's finances had not yet been disentangled, but ""there's not going to be any great windfall"". ""There's certainly nothing that's going to sustain any ongoing financial benefit for the family,"" he added. Widow Nadene Lomu at the funeral with children Brayley and Dhyreille Lomu died last month after suffering from kidney issues for 20 years. Nephrotic syndrome forced his premature retirement from international rugby in 2002. After having a kidney transplant in 2004 he tried unsuccessfully to resume his professional career in Wales and France. While his health seemed to improve he could not regain his former dominance and eventually retired from all rugby in 2006. Since Lomu's transplant failed in 2011, he became reliant on dialysis. Mr Nichol added: ""It appears that because of Jonah's well-known generosity, he had taken on obligations, financial and otherwise, to support others at the expense of himself, Nadene and the children. ""It is also apparent that his 20-year illness and long dialysis sessions, multiple times a week, affected him far more than people realised, including his ability to work and earn the type of money people probably assumed he was capable of earning.   ""He was a humble and private person who chose not to seek help or be a burden on others in sharing his immediate challenges. Gallery: In Pics: New Zealand Rugby Legend Dies At The Age Of 40 Jonah Lomu won 63 caps for the All Blacks during an impressive career ""Despite his debilitating illness he was unwaveringly optimistic and clearly had faith he would be able to continue working to meet these obligations and to provide for his family. ""Due to his untimely death, we all know this is sadly not to be, and Jonah is now unable to provide for his boys - for their development, welfare and education."" The boys flanked Nadene as she addressed mourners at the funeral. They wore black shirts bearing the winger's number 11, the position their father revolutionised as he became rugby's first global star. The Trust is being created with the blessing of the family but will not be run by them. Donations can be made at www.jonahlomulegacy.com."

Cathy Bartlett, 30, lived a luxurious ""fantasy"" lifestyle as she committed fraud against her sister and stole over £40,000 from her father. She gave her sister Rachael sleeping tablets and alcohol on 7 April, the night she set fire to their mother's house in Bartley, Hampshire. Winchester Crown Court heard Bartlett torched the New Forest property to stop the fraud being discovered. She stole the money while working as financial manager for her sister's company. Remains of the house in Bartley, in Hampshire's New Forest A doll can be seen in the fire-damaged house The judge, Jane Miller QC, told Bartlett her actions had been ""completely ruthless"" ""Quite frankly you are evil. You accepted in your evidence your behaviour was cunning, calculating and devious."" Bartlett was sentenced for attempted murder, 10 counts of fraud coming to £96,000, and one of theft for stealing £43,000 from her father. Prosecutors said she had used the money to live a ""fantasy of grandeur"", including splashing out on expensive gifts and spending £20,000 on hospitality football tickets ""with the aim of buying friends"". The court also heard Bartlett is suspected of burning down her sister's caravan - an attack which killed her 14-year-old dog Jade.  Cathy Bartlett used the money she stole to try to buy friends Bartlett had a luxury lifestyle: this stash of vodka was found at her house Bartlett's father had refused to make a police complaint about his daughter's theft and her parents cut ties with Rachael for supporting the prosecution. The judge said they had been ""supporting the wrong daughter"". She told the defendant: ""It's Rachael that deserves their compassion and not you. I hope they will regret their behaviour towards Rachael and she has the generosity to forgive them."" In a victim impact statement, the 34-year-old revealed she suffers from nightmares and panic attacks and that she still has no contact with her parents. ""Cathy was not only my sister but my best friend, someone I trusted and relied on,"" she said. ""What she has done has ripped our family apart ... The fact that she was then prepared to kill me to cover up her actions is so disturbing I still haven't been able to come to terms with it."" Her statement continued: ""I know none of this is my fault but I still find myself isolated. ""I love my sister and I always thought she loved me back. All of this has come as a great shock to me, I feel the sheer magnitude of the effect on me cannot be put into words. ""I think Cathy needs help and I hope she gets the help she needs."""

The 15-year-old was found by an off-duty policeman in a road in Stourbridge in Dudley on Thursday night. She was suffering from a fractured skull, broken legs and internal injuries.  Police are investigating reports that a light grey or light blue coloured vehicle was involved and urging anyone who saw the crash, or who has any information, to contact them. Sergeant Steve Newbury from West Midlands Police's Collision Investigation Unit, said: ""The girl is very poorly in hospital … it's shocking to think someone could leave a child seriously hurt in the street, drive off and make no effort to get her medical treatment. ""Clearly this is distressing at any time for the girl's family but to happen just days before Christmas is truly heart-breaking."" The collision is believed to have happened just before 10pm in Grange Lane near Pedmore Technology College. The Collision Investigation Unit can be contacted on the 101 phone number."

It comes as Kensington Palace said George would start at a nursery before the end of January. The two-year-old will attend Westacre Montessori - near Anmer Hall, their Norfolk home - for a few days a week. Westacre Montessori School is rated as 'good' in its latest Ofsted report The nursery said in a statement: ""We are looking forward to welcoming George to our nursery where he will get the same special experience as all our children."" Westacre Montessori School was rated ""good"" in its Ofsted report in June. Gallery: Kensington Palace Tweet New Photos Of Princess Charlotte The Duchess of Cambridge took these photos of six-month-old Princess Charlotte in early November. The nursery is down a private lane in East Walton, on the West Acre Estate. The village, which is 10 miles from Anmer where the family lives, is little more than a handful of houses and a church surrounded by farmers' fields. Mary Howard, who is 82, used to run the former post office and has lived in the hamlet all her life. She described the news as ""absolutely delightful"". The new photo of the family was taken in October in the garden of Kensington Palace by photographer Chris Jelf. Princess Charlotte was five months old at the time, and George two years and three months. Gallery: Mario Testino Photos Of Princess Charlotte Royal Christening The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, who was christened at Sandringham on Sunday July 5, 2015. © Mario Testino /Art Partner ""I thoroughly enjoyed photographing a very lovely family,"" said Mr Jelf. ""Although you have to be sharp, as you don't have long when there are two young children involved! ""I hope everyone enjoys this photo and I am honoured that the Duke and Duchess have decided to share it with the public."" Last month new images of Princess Charlotte, taken by the Duchess of Cambridge, were released, including one showing her giggling and playing with a toy dog. Official photos of the Royal Family were also given to the media after Charlotte's christening in July. The images by celebrity photographer Mario Testino showed the princess with her parents, grandparents and the Queen and Prince Philip.  Gallery: Duchess Of Cambridge's Pictures Of Her Little Prince And Princess The photos were taken by the Duchess of Cambridge in the middle of May In June, there were more official pictures - of Prince George holding his baby sister in his arms and giving her a kiss. A relaxed image of Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall hugging was also chosen for their official Christmas card this year. The pictures of the Royal children are thought to partly be an attempt to satisfy the intense interest in them and ward off the attraction of paparazzi snaps. Kensington Palace called Prince George, the future King, paparazzi's ""number one target"" in an open letter to the media in August. It cited a number of examples of photographers going to extreme lengths to get a photo, including one man who tried to get a photo of Prince George by lying down inside a car boot."
2015-12-19,The new Star Wars film has smashed opening day box office records in both the UK and US.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151219184310/http://news.sky.com/story/1608805/star-wars-tops-harry-potter-box-office-record,"The new Star Wars film has smashed opening day box office records in both the UK and US. Star Wars: The Force Awakens took an estimated $57m (£38m) from cinemas across America and Canada on Thursday - easily beating the $43.5m (£29m) set by Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 four years ago. It also made around £9.7m ($14.4m) in the UK and Ireland, according to figures by Walt Disney Co. Movie-goers at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood Around a quarter of those sales were due to midnight screenings on Thursday morning. Many fans flocked to theatres dressed as Stormtroopers or light saber-wielding Jedi. The film - the seventh instalment in the series created by George Lucas in 1977 - cost Disney an estimated $200m (£134m) to make. Disney expects Friday's US and Canada ticket sales to top $100m (£67m), and thinks another $100m will be taken this weekend. Some analysts believe it could become the top-grossing film of all time, beating the $2.8bn (£1.9bn) taken by James Cameron's 2009 blockbuster Avatar. Gallery: Fisher Brings Her Dog To Premiere Carrie Fisher took her dog Gary to the premiere of Star Wars: The Force Awakens in London It features newcomers Daisy Ridley and John Boyega alongside original stars Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher, and has been showered with good reviews. The Force Awakens scored a 95% positive rating on review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, scoring an average of 8.2 out of 10 in more than 250 reviews. The film is ""packed with action and populated by both familiar faces and fresh blood"" and ""successfully recalls the series' former glory while injecting it with renewed energy"", according to the website's critics' consensus. Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at box office tracking firm Rentrak, puts its success down to strong reviews and Disney's carefully planned release of film trailers over the last few months. ""That worked the audience into a frenzy,"" he said. ""It's just a perfect storm of Star Wars enthusiasm."" The seventh chapter in George Lucas' space saga is set 30 years after Return Of The Jedi, and is crucial to Disney's success. The US firm paid $4.06bn (£2.7bn) for Lucasfilm in 2012, and has a number of sequels and spinoffs already in development, not to mention an entire corner of Disneyland devoted to the franchise."

This was done in 1961, when the average household salary was around £1,000. Hill's old teammate and English captain Johnny Hayes became the first player to earn £100 per week and now players such as Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney are reportedly paid around £300,000 a week. He fought for players to enjoy freedom of movement after retirement and also for the rights of clubs to wear sponsors' logos on their shirts. :: For The Fans During his time as Coventry manager - which began in 1961 - Hill commissioned the first all-seater stadium in England, the first electronic scoreboard in 1964, pre-match entertainment, organised trains to take fans to away matches and commissioned the first colour match-day programme. He changed Coventry's colours to sky blue and he wrote the long-standing club anthem The Sky Blue Song. He reversed a 10-year ban on players speaking to the press, pushed for live coverage of games and asked that players call him 'JH', rather than 'boss' or 'gaffer'. :: Jimmy Hill Dies, Aged 87 :: New Points System Hill led the campaign for the three-point system, which was introduced in the English Football League in 1981. Before then, teams received two points for a win and one for a draw but Hill thought that having three points up for grabs for a win would mean more attacking play and exciting football. The system was brought in for the 1994 World Cup finals, FIFA adopted it in 1995 and it is now standard practice. :: Players As Pundits Soon after Hill stopped playing, he turned to broadcasting and a position as head of sports for ITV. In his 1970 coverage of the World Cup, he introduced panels and pundits, something which is now common in football coverage. He became the country's most recognisable expert during his long association with Match of the Day."
2015-12-19,It's 7pm in central London on one of the busiest nights for the emergency services.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151219184310/http://news.sky.com/story/1609008/paramedics-struggle-with-black-eye-friday,"By Tom Platt, Sky Reporter It's 7pm in central London on one of the busiest nights for the emergency services. Dubbed Black Eye Friday, ambulance and police services across the country are dealing with boozed-up festive revellers. They're called to drunken brawls, paralytic sleepers, and those who've hurt themselves on what was meant to be a good night out. We followed one paramedic team around the capital for the night. Our first call is to a man who's been hit by a taxi. He's drunk and tells us he's on drugs. He's abusive and uncooperative. Once in the back of the ambulance he swears at the paramedic, but later incessantly asks for her mobile number. By the time he arrives at A&E, he is running around the waiting room, despite potentially having broken his knee. Between the call outs to people who have had too much to drink, there are the day to day incidents too. We respond to a woman who has gone into labour, a man with heart trouble and a stabbing. When we arrive to help someone who has drunk too much, they're typically more time-consuming, uncooperative, and can clog up the system. It's a problem for emergency services across the country. In Manchester police say they received 2,500 calls by 10pm. The North West Ambulance service has received more than 3,000 calls by midnight. Last year in London, 700 ambulance call-outs during the weekend before Christmas were down to drink. Our fourth call is to a young man who has passed out in the street. He's covered in vomit and unresponsive. His friends are stood by his limp body, but can't do anything to rouse him. He is lifted onto the trolley and driven to the nearest hospital. During the journey the paramedic tries to wake him, but gets moans and groans in return. By midnight A&E is full of young and old party goers who have drunk too much. There is vomit everywhere. People are propped up in chairs, their heads lolling. It comes as no surprise to those who are too used to dealing with it. Paramedic Laura Pugsley said: ""It just seems to get busier year-on-year and there's just not enough ambulances. ""We've got the same amount of ambulances going to more people, the hospitals are not creating more beds for these people to go to, so we're not managing to expand with it."" In this period of Christmas excess, some are pushing themselves to the point of collapse, and testing the limits of the emergency services too. The warning from those on the front line is clear; avoid A&E as your drinking could be costing someone else the care they need."
2015-12-19,"A cross-party group of MPs have said plans to privatise Britain's ""green"" bank should not go ahead unless the Government can ensure it retains its environmental purposes.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151219184310/http://news.sky.com/story/1608862/bank-risks-losing-green-identity-if-sold-off,"A cross-party group of MPs have said plans to privatise Britain's ""green"" bank should not go ahead unless the Government can ensure it retains its environmental purposes. The Green Investment Bank (GIB) was created by former Liberal Democrat business secretary Vince Cable in 2012 to drive private investment in the UK's green infrastructure, including renewable energy. In June, Business Secretary Sajid Javid announced his intention to sell-off the Edinburgh-based bank in order to allow it to borrow more capital by removing restrictions on its borrowing and freeing it from EU state aid rules. But in a new report, the House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee warned that the GIB risks losing its ""green identity"" as a result of privatisation, which could ""damage its reputation and ""undermine its leadership role in the green economy"". It also criticised the Government for taking the decision to privatise GIB without ""due transparency, publication of relevant evidence, consultation, or proper consideration of alternatives"". Committee chairman Huw Irranca-Davies said: ""The Green Investment Bank has done a great job of getting capital flowing to the kind of innovative green projects that sometimes struggle to secure financial backing. ""The decision to privatise the Bank appears rushed and ministers have not produced convincing evidence that it will achieve its aims better in the private sector. ""The Government must ensure the Green Investment Bank continues to do what it says on the tin. If the Government cannot guarantee that the Green Investment Bank will retain its green purpose in the private sector then the sale should not go ahead."" Since it was launched in 2012, the GIB has invested £2.3bn of public money in 60 projects with a total value of more than £10bn, many of them in the areas of non-domestic energy efficiency, waste and offshore wind. The projects are required to make a contribution to one of the bank's five ""green purposes"" - reducing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing the efficiency of the use of natural products, protecting the natural environment or biodiversity and promoting environmental sustainability. But they are also required to provide market-based commercial returns. The committee recommended that the Government should retain a minority stake in the Bank if the sell-off goes ahead, and should establish a ""special share"" to enable it to protect the green purposes. But it also urged ministers to produce a business case and assessments of the likely impact of the sale, along with an evaluation of the benefits of alternative options."

Jermaine Baker, 28, died from a single shot during the operation to foil an alleged bid to spring two convicts from a prison van near Wood Green Court last Friday. The Metropolitan Police officer - who has been suspended from duty - is being interviewed under caution, according to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Mr Baker was shot inside a black Audi car where a gun was found, according to the IPCC's Cindy Butts. She told a community meeting in Tottenham: ""Further forensic examination will take place on the non-police issue firearm, and the firearm that was discharged by the police officer."" The public meeting was emotional with some of the 150 people in attendance shouting that Mr Baker was ""murdered"" and others questioning why the officers had not been wearing body cameras.  The IPCC has launched a criminal homicide investigation into the death - which could see the police face murder or manslaughter charges. Jermaine Baker was shot inside a black Audi car Ms Butts told the meeting: ""There was evidence to indicate that a potential criminal offence may have been committed by the officer in his use of lethal force. ""The evidence we have at this stage does not mean that the officer definitively committed a criminal act and nor does it mean he will necessarily be charged with a criminal offence."" A witness appeal will take place on Friday morning in the street where the shooting took place, she added. The Met's Deputy Assistant Commissioner Peter Terry said: ""It is absolutely vital that the facts of what took place are thoroughly established, as quickly as possible. ""As police officers, we are all fully aware that we will be asked to account for our actions. We are not exempt from the law and would not wish to be."" Four men have been charged over the alleged plot to free the two convicts. They have been remanded in custody to appear next at Wood Green Crown Court on 4 January."

Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman told the AFP news agency the jets bombed Raqqa, the self-declared capital of Islamic State's caliphate. The warplanes also bombed the towns of Azaz and al Bab in Aleppo province, Mr Rahman said. Six children and 11 women were among the dead, with dozens of people wounded, according to the British-based monitoring group. The death toll in Raqqa included two rescue workers, according to Mr Rahman, who added no suspected militants were killed in the three areas hit. Refugees fleeing the city have told Sky News the militants' grip there is weakening as a result of coalition airstrikes. Russia has been carrying out airstrikes on armed opposition groups throughout Syria for almost three months. Moscow's campaign has been criticised by the West and rebels fighting Syrian President Bashar al Assad for targeting non-jihadist groups and causing civilian casualties. The Observatory says it distinguishes between airstrikes carried out by Syrian, Russian and US-led coalition aircraft by looking at flight patterns, as well as the type of planes and ordnance used. It identifies those killed through its network of activists, medical workers at local hospitals and fighters on the ground."

Millions of tonnes of coal had been extracted from Kellingley colliery since it began production in North Yorkshire in 1965.  ""The Big K"", as it became known, was one of Europe's largest mines. Energy experts say the UK's response to climate change sounded the death knell for a mine which still has tens of millions of tonnes of reserves. Miners leave after their last shift at the colliery At its peak the colliery employed 1,600 workers, but redundancies have reduced that figure to 450.  The National Union of Mineworkers says that with help from the Government the colliery could have stayed open but the pit's owners UK Coal have blamed ""extremely difficult trading conditions"" for its closure. Lee Gent's father and grandfather were miners and he is one of the last underground pitmen ever to be employed in the industry. Lee Gent had tried for years to get a job at Kellingley The 26-year-old told Sky News that he had tried for years to get a job at Kellingley and was ""ecstatic"" when he finally achieved his goal.  ""I tried since I was 16 and I finally got it when I was 24. They promised me a career but within 18 months it was shattered ... it was gone,"" he said. ""People don't understand the size of the matter. At its peak Kellingley colliery employed 1,600 workers ""They'll see it on the news and then they'll forget about it.  But you have got to think about how it really does affect families, especially round here."" Energy expert Professor Steve Fothergill, from Sheffield Hallam University, says Kellingley's closure marks a significant moment in the country's economic history. ""Britain's industrial revolution and much that followed was fuelled by coal,"" he said. ""In the 80s and 90s I think you have to put down the closures to a vendetta by the Conservative government. ""But more recently it's been the economics. It's been very hard for the British coal industry to compete with coal traded on the international market. Kellingley colliery still has tens of millions of tonnes of reserves ""We are still burning extraordinary large quantities of coal in British power stations so it's not that we've stopped using coal; it's just that were not using UK-mined coal anymore."" Kellingley's closure means that the only place with a working deep mine shaft in England will be the National Coal Mining Museum near Wakefield in Yorkshire. Former miners who now take visitors underground said they were saddened to see the death of their old industry. Tour guide Eric Richardson said: ""Mining changed our world. We made a good living out of it. There were some days you want to forget and some days you never want to forget. ""We played hard and worked hard. The community was together."""

A Canadian man is in custody after killing the Briton, Unais Gomes, 26, in apparent self-defence on Wednesday night. Witnesses said Mr Gomes attacked the Canadian, 29-year-old Joshua Andrew Freeman Stevens, with a knife after suffering a bad trip. The pair had been drinking a hallucinogenic plant brew known as ayahuasca at a spiritual retreat near the jungle city of Iquitos. Joshua Andrew Freeman Stevens Ayahuasca, which is a combination of an Amazonian vine and dimethyltryptamine (DMT), gives users a psychedelic experience although it is not normally associated with violence. ""It might be folkloric, spiritual or whatever else, but that doesn't mean it isn't a drug that dramatically alters your state of mind,"" police chief Normando Marques said. A local police source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Mr Gomes is believed to have used a knife from the kitchen of a nearby alternative health centre to attack Mr Stevens. Mr Stevens allegedly used the same knife to kill Mr Gomes, stabbing him in the chest and stomach, the source said. Ayahuasca, also known as yage, is used by Amazonian tribes in Peru and Brazil as a spiritual or medicinal tool.  Dozens of jungle retreats offer the brew to tourists. In 2012 an American teen died after drinking ayahuasca during a ritual in the Madre de Dios jungle region of Peru. A shaman later admitted trying to cover up the death by burying him in the grounds of the retreat."

Thousands have been killed."" :: UN Targets Flow Of Money To Islamic State Much of rural northern Syria is now deserted - broken and smashed up buildings litter the landscape. It is, of course, the emptying of these places that set in motion Europe's refugee crisis. But the displacement of civilians shows no end with another wave of refugees about to begin. We meet another family who have also just escaped from Raqqa.

They are also being pushed back by Kurdish fighters. Under cover of the jets' massive firepower, Kurdish troops have been able to mount a number of successful offensives in northern Syria to restrict IS supply lines. YPG commander Lawand Rojava told me how they help coordinate the strikes by marking IS positions on the battlefield.

2015-12-19,Pope Francis has cleared the way for Mother Teresa's sainthood after approving a second miracle attributed to her.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151219184310/http://news.sky.com/story/1608285/mother-teresa-to-be-saint-as-miracle-approved,"By Neville Lazarus, Asia Producer Pope Francis has cleared the way for Mother Teresa's sainthood after approving a second miracle attributed to her. The canonisation is expected to be later next year.  Speaking to Sky News, Thomas D'Souza, the Archbishop of Kolkata, a city which Mother Teresa made her home, said: ""We are very happy and overjoyed with this news, the city of Kolkata has been waiting for this day. We thank God of the great gift he bestowed on us with Mother Teresa."" According to a statement from the Vatican, the second miracle involved a Brazilian man with a viral brain infection that resulted in multiple abscesses. In December 2008 the patient was in a coma and dying and various treatments had been ineffective. The patient’s wife is said to have continuously sought the intercession of Mother Teresa for her husband A woman holds a picture of Mother Teresa dueing a protest earlier this year He was wheeled into the operating theatre for emergency surgery at 6.10pm on 9 December 2008 . At the same time, his wife went to her church and along with the pastor begged Mother Teresa for the cure of her dying husband. At 6.40pm the neurosurgeon returned to the operating room and found the patient inexplicably awake and without pain. He asked the doctor: ""What I am doing here?"" The next morning he was examined, fully awake and without any headache. On 10 September this year, the medical commission voted unanimously that his cure was inexplicable in the light of current medical knowledge. The man, now completely healed, resumed his work as a mechanical engineer without any particular limitation. Mother Teresa was born in Skopje in modern-day Macedonia to a Kosovar-Albanian family. She left home at 18 and moved to Ireland and then to India in 1929. Pope John Paul II with Mother Teresa in Kolkata in 1986 In Kolkata she founded the Missionaries of Charity to look after the poorest of the poor. The organisation has more than 4500 religious sisters in 500 institutions operating in some 100 countries.   A Nobel laureate in 1979, she dedicated her life to looking after the destitute and dying in India. She also helped rescue children trapped on the frontlines during the Siege of Beirut, as well as working with the hungry in Ethiopia, Chernobyl radiation victims and earthquake victims in Armenia. Mother Teresa was criticised by some for her staunch Catholic beliefs on abortion and divorce, and for accepting the Legion d’honneur from Haitian dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier. Mother Teresa died in 1997 at the age of 87. Pope John Paul beatified her in 2003, which is the step before sainthood. Canonisation requires one more miracle after beatification. Archbishop D'Souza told Sky News: ""The date and place for the canonisation is yet to be determined, but for now we shall celebrate a thanksgiving mass at Mother's House in Kolkata in a day or so."""

The Prime Minister spent over half an hour detailing the UK Government's concerns to all 27 other leaders in the bloc at a summit dinner in Brussels on Thursday - and hailed the discussion as ""a big step forward"". Mr Cameron said he believed he had secured ""a pathway to a deal"" and said 2016 would be the year for ""fundamental change"" for Britain in Europe. He said: ""It is going to be tough and there is a lot of hard work to do . ""But I believe 2016 will be the year we achieve something really vital, fundamentally changing the UK's relationship with the EU and finally addressing the concerns of the British people about our membership. ""Then it will be for the British people to decide whether we remain or leave. It is a choice we will all need to think hard about. ""I believe if we can get these reforms right - and I believe that we can - I firmly believe that for our economic security and increasingly for our national security, the best future for Britain is in a reformed European Union."" The Prime Minister told Sky News that the controversial plan to attempt to limit EU migration by making migrants wait four years for benefits was still on the table for further discussion ahead of final decisions in February. A long list of EU leaders had called the demand ""unacceptable"" just hours before the dinner. :: Should Britain Stay Or Go? But no alternative to the plan was discussed by Britain or any other nation. The European Council and Commission will now lead technical talks on as-yet-unspecified options that meet the same objectives as the four-year ban. At the end of the dinner, Mr Cameron was boosted by talk from the German Chancellor Angela Merkel which suggested any agreement struck in February could promise future treaty change. ""We made it clear that we are ready to compromise, but always on the basis that we safeguard the core European principles, which include non-discrimination and free movement,"" she said The dinner negotiations lasted four hours, with interventions from all the EU's big hitters. Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny implored other EU leaders that Mr Cameron needed some help and that they should give it to him. Italian PM Matteo Renzi had earlier told Sky News that Mr Cameron's negotiation would help to create a vision for a new EU, but that agreeing some of the measures would take ""months"".

Pamela Hudson, 75, was rushed to hospital from her council home in June with injuries to her face, body and arms. She died three months later after she had been transferred to alternative accommodation. Mrs Hudson's daughter Jan Derry said a rat had ""gnawed"" at the bedridden pensioner, leaving about 50 bites at Glen Lodge, a sheltered accommodation facility with extra care in York. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the Government would be investigating the case after pictures of her injuries were published in a newspaper. He said: ""These pictures are appalling and show the suffering of a vulnerable woman who, along with her family, was stripped of her dignity and badly let down. ""Working across government, ministers are ordering an investigation which will be launched in the coming days. ""Whatever the sort of social care provider, patients have a right to expect the highest standards, and that is what we are determined to secure."" After details of the incident emerged, City of York Council said it had investigated but could not find the cause of Mrs Hudson's injuries. Martin Farran, director of adult social care, said: ""We have worked closely with, and provided support to, Mrs Hudson and her family throughout the investigation into this incident. ""It is with regret that, despite extensive efforts by professional experts, environmental health and independent inspectors, we have been unable to determine the exact circumstances of how Mrs Hudson's injuries occurred. ""Our thoughts are with Mrs Hudson's family, who are understandably distressed by what has happened."" Caroline Abrahams, director of Age UK, said the case was ""the stuff of nightmares"". ""Our care system is under so much pressure that no one can be 100% confident an older loved one will always be cared for as well as they should be,"" she said."

The Dutchman is poised to replace Jose Mourinho, who was sacked on Thursday after a miserable start to the season left the Premier League champions just one point above the relegation zone. Hiddink has reportedly told the Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf that he is in the capital to hold initial talks with Chelsea over the vacant role. ""I want to gather as much information as possible. Chelsea indeed has a lousy performance and there are reasons for it,"" the 69-year-old was quoted as saying. :: Analysis - Hiddink: Chelsea's Smiling Stand-In Gallery: Guus Hiddink's Highs And Lows Guus Hiddink, who is expected to be appointed the new Chelsea boss, has had a varied managerial career. His first job was at Dutch giants PSV, where he guided them to their first European Cup ""First, I want to get a good understanding of this, before I make my decision."" Hiddink has reportedly said the deal might not be done before Saturday's home game against Sunderland. He told Fox Sports in the Netherlands: ""We are still talking, exchanging stuff, looking at the situation properly. ""It is possible that we would still use this weekend to discuss. I cannot tell you more at this point."" A senior figure at the club said Mourinho, the self-proclaimed ""Special One"", was sacked on Thursday because of a ""palpable discord"" between him and the players. Sky's Sports Correspondent Paul Kelso said it is understood Hiddink will be in charge until the end of the season, at which point Chelsea will look for a long-term successor to Mourinho. He said: ""Guus Hiddink is a man perfectly suited to this kind of firefighting role, he's 69 years old, he has experience and a light touch."" :: Jose Mourinho's 20 Most Memorable Quotes Hiddink has managed Chelsea once before, taking the reigns in 2009 when Luiz Felipe Scolari was dismissed.

Hiddink's anticipated return comes a day after Mourinho was called to Chelsea's training ground and sacked by club chairman Bruce Buck and director Eugene Tenenbaum.

Dominic Carr, who owns a jewellery store on London's Liverpool Street, grappled with one of the gang members, Alex Parle, as he tried to flee the scene on a moped. Moments earlier, two fellow robbers used sledgehammers to smash into glass cabinets and steal luxury watches worth £222,000. The business owner managed to jump on the thief's back after a plain-clothes police officer thwarted their escape on two mopeds by parking across the road - leaving Parle with no choice but to run after the getaway vehicles. Parle was arrested soon afterwards, while crash helmets and the machete used in the attack were recovered nearby. Detectives from three police forces were then able to connect the gang of three men to six other armed robberies between February 2014 and January 2015. A separate CCTV recording from a money transfer shop in Newham showed the violence used in their attacks. That footage shows a man in a helmet smashing through the cashier's window with a concrete block, before grabbing bundles of cash and dragging a lone female member of staff by the hair. At the Old Bailey on 5 November, Parle, Thomas O'Connor and Conor Gartland pleaded guilty to stealing cash and jewellery worth more than £550,000 during their spree. Speaking in court, Mr Carr said he acted out of a ""spontaneous response to protect"" when he grappled with Parle outside his shop - but insisted he did not see himself as any kind of hero. He added: ""The fear of what could have happened had the man with the machete actually used it is something that goes over and over in my head. ""Who would look after my wife and children if he actually killed me with it? ""I am now wary every time I see a motorbike pass the shop and I wonder whether I'm about to be robbed again."" O'Connor,  23, from Rotherhithe, southeast London, was jailed for 12 years with detectives describing him as the ""key organiser"" of the ""alarmingly violent robberies"". Gartland, an 18-year-old from Southwark, south London, received eight years behind bars while Parle, also from Southwark, was handed a 10-year sentence. Acting Detective Inspector Kelly Schonhage, from the City of London Police, said: ""These men are part of a wider organised crime network who commit commercial robberies targeting money transfer shops and jewellers. ""I would like to thank the brave member of the public who put themselves at risk to help catch one of the suspects during the robbery at Liverpool Street."""

Augusta County School District shut 23 schools in Virginia because they had received messages that were ""threatening and very profane in nature"", said police. Sheriff Randall Fisher said security has been assigned to the district superintendent, Eric Bond, the teacher who set the lesson, and to the school principal. A geography teacher at Riverheads High in Staunton, Virginia, gave her students the assignment one week ago to try out calligraphy and write some Arabic. The 'tone and content' of communication from parents triggered the closure Students were asked to copy out the shahada, or Muslim statement of faith, which reads: ""There is no god but Allah. Mohammed is the messenger of Allah."" Parents were angered by the assignment, with posts on Facebook accusing the school of religious indoctrination. The school district's statement read: ""Following parental objections to the World Geography curriculum and ensuing related media coverage, the school division began receiving voluminous phone calls and electronic mail locally and from outside the area. ""As a result of these communications, the Sheriff's Office and the school division co-ordinated to increase police presence at Augusta County schools and to monitor those communications. ""The communications have significantly increased in volume today and based on concerns regarding the tone and content of those communications, Sheriff Fisher and Dr Bond mutually decided schools and school offices will be closed on Friday, December 18."" In the statement, school officials insisted that ""no lesson was designed to promote a religious viewpoint or change any student's religious belief"". It added that students would continue to learn about world religions as required by state academic standards, but would practise calligraphy using a different example."

The call from the Local Government Association (LGA), which represents 46 fire authorities in England and Wales, comes after a number of major retailers pulled the self-balancing scooters from their shelves. The LGA said more than 80% of 38,000 hoverboards stopped from entering the UK by Trading Standards since October had been deemed unsafe – many because of an ""increased risk of exploding or bursting into flames"". Jeremy Hilton, chairman of the LGA's fire services management committee, said: ""Hoverboards are top of Christmas wishlists for many people this year, but these exploding gadgets can cause major fires which put lives at risk. ""Trading Standards teams at councils nationwide have been working hard to stop dangerous hoverboards entering the country, but people are able to buy them online from unofficial websites. ""With major retailers pulling them from sale, we are urging people to think twice about buying a hoverboard because of the significant fire risk associated with them."" Halfords, Amazon, John Lewis and Argos have stopped selling versions of the gadget in recent weeks. Many cheap, fake imports have hit the headlines after fires including one in Kent, which caused £25,000 damage after a hoverboard overheated while charging. The LGA is advising people to avoid ""fake and suspiciously cheap hoverboards"", especially those being sold online."

In a 1985 memo responding to the Broadwater Farm riot in North London, recently released by the National Archives, Oliver Letwin said: ""The root of social malaise is not poor housing, or youth 'alienation', or the lack of a middle class. ""Lower-class, unemployed white people lived for years in appalling slums without a breakdown of public order."" It's not the first time the Conservative MP has been forced to apologise for controversial comments. Here's a rundown of the top Oliver Letwin gaffes. 1. I’d rather beg than send my children to state school In 2003 the Eton-educated MP was forced to apologise after saying at a fringe meeting: ""In Lambeth where I live, I would give my right arm to send them to a fee-paying school. ""If necessary I would go out on the streets and beg rather than send them to a school next to where I live."" 2. We don’t want people from Sheffield going on cheap holidays  In 2011 the Cabinet Office minister reportedly said ""we don't want more people from Sheffield flying away on cheap holidays"" in a row with London Mayor Boris Johnson about new airports. He later said: ""I do not ever comment on things that are alleged to have been said in private conversations but I would never knowingly ever say anything offensive to anybody."" 3. The government will run out of ideas by 2012 Coalition MPs were treated to an admirably frank assessment by Mr Letwin at a 2011 meeting, when he told them: ""By the end of 2012 we've run out of ideas. ""We don't know what we're doing – so we're trying to work it out."" A spokesman said: ""Any suggestion that Oliver Letwin said the Government will 'do nothing' after two years is completely untrue."" 4. The NHS will not exist under the Tories In June 2004, Mr Letwin reportedly told a private meeting that the NHS would cease to exist within five years of a Conservative victory, and become a ""funding stream handing out money to pay people where they want to go for their healthcare"". A spokesman for the then-shadow chancellor said he had said ""nothing of the sort"".   ""What he in fact said was that under a Conservative government the monolithic bureaucracy of the NHS would be dismantled within five years,"" the spokesman said. 5. We'll cut taxes by £20bn In May 2001 Mr Letwin, then shadow chief secretary to the treasury, was forced to go into hiding during the general election campaign after claiming the Conservatives planned to cut taxes by £20bn. At the time leader William Hague was promising £8bn of cuts, but Mr Letwin told the Financial Times he was ""190 per cent"" confident that number would be higher. He later told Sky News he had never given that figure as a Tory commitment, but would not be drawn on whether he had suggested it as a longer-term possibility. 6. Primary children should choose whether to wear seatbelts St Mary's Primary School in Bridport, in Mr Letwin's West Dorset constituency, invited the MP to give a talk on cycle safety in 2012, expecting him to argue for compulsory helmets for children. Instead he told gathered pupils that it ""should be down to the individual"" and they should decide for themselves ""at around nine or ten years old."" He went on to say: ""I personally don’t think, for example, that wearing seat belts in cars or wearing helmets on motorbikes should be compulsory either."" 7. Papers dumped in park bins In 2011, the Cabinet Office minister apologised after being photographed dumping papers in a park's bins on five separate occasions. Downing Street  said he had promised not to throw official documents in public bins in future. Information Commissioner Christopher Graham later ruled that he had broken the law."

Assistant Chief Constable Marcus Beale, Counter Terrorism lead for the West Midlands, said: ""Whilst we remain concerned about people travelling to Syria and the risk they pose should they return to the UK, we also consider the threat posed by UK-based individuals and groups who have never travelled or intended to do so.

A fourth, unidentified, passenger said: ""Like, you see everything flying around. Whoever didn't put the seatbelt on, was falling off."" Air Canada said the Boeing 777 - carrying 332 passengers and 19 crew members - landed without incident. The airline said it would be making arrangements to accommodate the other passengers, including those continuing on to Toronto, and that the incident was being investigated. There was no immediate indication of what caused the turbulence."

2015-12-31,A review of airport shopping sales to ensure VAT savings are being passed on to customers has been announced by George Osborne.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151231184652/http://news.sky.com/story/1614526/airport-shopping-vat-relief-to-be-reviewed,"A review of airport shopping sales to ensure VAT savings are being passed on to customers has been announced by George Osborne. With thousands of Britons expected to head abroad for holidays in the New Year, the Chancellor hopes the ""extensive"" review will help eligible shoppers benefit from the tax relief. Some retailers inside airport terminals have been accused of pocketing as much as 50p out of every £1 in VAT, with little difference between the prices seen in airside branches and on the high street. The review will also include other airport shopping taxes, including excise duty - however, this particular form of relief is already closely regulated by HM Revenue and Customs. Mr Osborne said: ""VAT relief at airports is intended to cut prices for travellers - not be a windfall gain for shops. ""But many people could be paying over the odds for their purchases because the Government's VAT concession isn't passed on. This is simply unacceptable."" VAT relief is designed for airport passengers who are flying to destinations outside the European Union. An investigation by The Independent in the summer revealed many airside retailers were asking shoppers for their boarding cards, even though the customers were not legally obliged to show them at the check-out, and failing to pass on the savings. Companies including Boots and WHSmith were among the stores accused by the newspaper of engaging in the practice. Mr Osborne expects the review to be completed by early 2016."
2015-12-31,"From glorious careers to ideas that have shaped politics for a generation, 2015 was a year of  political demise.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151231184652/http://news.sky.com/story/1614519/downfalls-10-political-exits-of-2015,"From glorious careers to ideas that have shaped politics for a generation, 2015 was a year of  political demise. For some leading MPs, political ambition died a death on a night of drama in May. If politics were a soap opera then on election night the script writers had gone mad. It was the plane crash in Emmerdale, the tram ploughing into Coronation Street, the fire at the Old Vic - with a dozen household names wiped off the scene in one episode. But many frontbenchers who lost seats don't even make the top ten - because what happened on election night wasn't even the half of it! Here are the top ten political deaths of 2015… 10. Yvette Cooper: The former Shadow Home Secretary has retreated to the wilderness of the backbenches after deciding she was unable to serve under new leader Jeremy Corbyn. In her bid for leadership she said she was ""not convinced"" Mr Corbyn wanted to be Prime Minister. Yvette Cooper saw her leadership campaign flounder 9. Sir Malcolm Rifkind: In February, the former Tory Cabinet minister was caught up in a cash-for-access scandal along with Labour's Jack Straw. Mr Rifkind was forced to stand down as chair of the Intelligence and Security Committee. Both were later cleared of wrongdoing by the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner, but more questions were raised this month by an Ofcom investigation into the events. 8. Lord Sewel: Not many of us had heard of him before 2015 but we got to know perhaps more than we needed to about Lord Sewel this year. The man in charge of standards in the House of Lords was pictured on the front page of the Sun wearing a pink bra. After intense media pressure he was forced to resign as Deputy Speaker in the Lords. Bullying claims against Mark Clarke (R) saw Grant Shapps lose his job 7. Grant Shapps: The Former Tory Party Chairman and International Development Secretary weathered a few scandals in his time but not that of the Tatler Tory. Mark Clarke faces allegations of bullying in the youth wing of the Tory party. Failure to keep him in check was pinned on Mr Shapps. 6. Vince Cable: The Lib Dem Former Business Secretary lost his 12,000 vote majority in Twickenham in one of the big shocks of the election. 5. Nick Clegg: He clung on to his seat in Sheffield but resigned as party leader after seeing Lib Dems lose 49 seats in what he described as a ""cruel and punishing night."" The party of government was reduced to eight places in the Commons. The 'Ed Stone' might have carried the Labour leader's political epitaph 4. Ed Miliband: He had a cruel night too. Was it the bacon sandwich, the economic competence question, or just a failure to offer a compelling alternative to the Conservatives? The electorate chose more austerity and cuts over Labour's plans to crack down on zero hours contracts and non-Doms. 3. Ed Balls: It might seem odd to give the Shadow Chancellor the number three slot ahead of his Leader, but the man who'd been a prominent feature of the party for a decade was the defining image of the night when he lost his seat of Morley and Outwood. 2. Scottish Labour: More significant than even Miliband and Balls was the death of Scottish Labour. Douglas Alexander, the architect of Labour's election campaign, couldn't even save his own seat from the Scottish National Party revolution in Scotland. He was defeated by 20 year-old Mhairi Black. Labour was left with one marker in its former heartland. The SNP took 56 out of 59 seats. A generation of Tony Blair's disciples has been marginalised 1. Blairism: Maybe this won't prove as significant for Labour as the loss of Scotland and some say Blairism isn't completely dead, but certainly it's on life support. The man himself said his party faced ""annihilation"" and was ""walking off a cliff with eyes shut,"" if it elected Jeremy Corbyn as Leader.  It did just that. When Chuka Umunna failed to stand for the Leadership, and Liz Kendall came last in the race won by Mr Corbyn, Blairism walked off a cliff. It is said that at this year's Labour Christmas party Tony Blair's signature tune Things Can Only Get Better was played. Corbynites sat it out while noting the names of those on the dance floor. Political deaths don't get much bigger than Blairism. What a year!"

The water slammed into the Chinese-owned COSL Innovator at the Troll gas field, west of Bergen, on Wednesday afternoon. Three people were airlifted for medical treatment by Norwegian rescuers, but one later died of their injuries. Eileen Brundtland, a spokeswoman at the Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority, said after the fatality: ""The weather was rough during the accident, with waves as high as 14m and wind speed 25m to 30m per second. ""Strong winds prevented a helicopter from landing on the rig and people had to be lifted."" About 50 of the 106 staff working on the rig have been evacuated and flown to the Norwegian coast. According to Statoil, the oil firm which operates Troll, the breaking wave also caused some damage to the rig's accommodation module. Doctors, nurses and psychologists assisted evacuees at a facility on land. Oil fields affected by bad weather in the North Sea In a statement, Statoil said the rig had been taken off the well as a result of bad weather before the incident occurred. The nationalities of those involved are yet to be disclosed. Meanwhile, BP announced it had decided to shut the Valhall field, several hundred miles to the south, due to safety concerns. More than 100 people were taken off the rig after a 110-metre long barge drifted towards it, BP spokesman Olav Fjellsa told Sky News. He said the vessel eventually passed by without causing any damage and the company was preparing to start normal operations again. According to the Met Office, two areas off the coast of Norway are experiencing winds of 11 on the Beaufort scale - a ""violent storm"" and one scale less than hurricane force. This is the first fatal accident off Norway for six years. In 2009, a person died after falling from scaffolding at the Oseberg B platform in the North Sea."

Essex Police said they were called to reports of a disturbance in Appleford Court, Pitsea, Basildon, just after 12.30am on Wednesday, and then received another report that a man had been found unconscious in a communal stairwell. He was given first aid but died at the scene. The man was believed to be in his mid-20s to mid-30s. Police said the 50-year-old suspect was arrested in Rectory Road shortly after 1am. ""He was initially detained on suspicion of assault before being further arrested for murder. He has been taken to Basildon Police Station where he currently remains for questioning,"" said a police spokesman. Detectives want to speak to a second man who left the scene before police arrived. He is described as white, 5ft 5in, in his mid-30s with short dark hair. He was wearing dark clothing.

After a 23-year National Hunt career, Sir Tony becomes only the second jockey in history to receive a knighthood. He said: ""It's right up there that's for sure.  I was very humbled when I heard the news - I never thought it was something that would ever happen to me. ""I'm very proud of it. I think it is great for myself but also great for the game of racing."" After beginning her acting career aged just 13, Dame Barbara caps a lifetime of achievement with a damehood. Best known for her slapstick lines in the Carry On films and as EastEnders TV landlady Peggy Mitchell, she told Sky News: ""I'm so thrilled and I'm so honoured. ""And everyone knows I'm a royalist through and through so that's a great thing for a little East End lady to be made a dame just for doing something she gets paid to do and she loves to do is a bit good innit."" Fellow East Londoner turned Hollywood star Idris Elba gets an OBE, as does another actor James Nesbitt.  His work helping those searching for loved ones following the Troubles in Northern Ireland has been recognised. Nesbitt said: ""On the citation it said for services to drama - whatever those services may be - and the community in Northern Ireland.   ""I've left Northern Ireland a very long time ago but I'm very much a Northern Irish boy at heart. ""And the notion that something I’ve been able to do in any way in any capacity in Northern Ireland means more to me than anything."" The actor said receiving an OBE will ""give credence"" to the cause of those left with missing relatives following the Troubles. Doctor Michael Jacobs, who treated three Britons with Ebola including Pauline Cafferkey, also received a knighthood for services to the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. The consultant, who works at the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, said: ""It is the nature of honours systems that they recognise individuals, but this truly was a team effort and I can't praise too highly my exceptional, dedicated and skilful colleagues at the Royal Free."" Two-time Tour de France winner Team Sky rider Chris Froome has been awarded an OBE. Falklands veteran and charity campaigner Simon Weston has spoken of his pride after being awarded a CBE. The Welsh Guardsman was horrifically injured on board the Sir Galahad warship after it was hit by an Argentine missile at Bluff Cove during the Falklands War in 1982.  Mr Weston, who already has an OBE to his name, said he was stunned when he found out last month that he was to be awarded a CBE. Gallery: AP McCoy: Career In Pictures Anthony Peter McCoy won 19 consecutive Champion Jockey titles and is one of the most decorated riders in the sport And Jacqueline Gold, the chief executive of Ann Summers and Knickerbox, said she ""didn't know whether to laugh, cry or scream"" when she found out she was being awarded the CBE for services to entrepreneurship and women in business. She said: ""I think for me personally I've worked in business for 35 years and I've contributed £1.5bn to the economy. ""I've given financial independence to over 350,000 women, I feel passionate about supporting women in business so to be recognised for the things closest to my heart is such a big deal for me."" The honours are not without allegations of cronyism.  David Cameron has been accused of undermining the system after it emerged Lynton Crosby, the Australian political strategist who ran the Conservatives' election campaign, is to get a knighthood. Nearly 1,200 people from all walks of life are named in the New Year's Honours. The organisers insist there are no automatic awards and all the winners have been recognised for their outstanding achievement and service. There is recognition for many who work to make life in their local community better - like Michael Pusey, founder of a BMX track in south London. He gets an MBE for services to youth sport. He said: ""I'm a person who doesn't really expect things.  ""I do things for the good of my heart and the good of the kids and when it (the letter) came through I actually thought 'this is from the Cabinet Office - is it the taxman? ""A lot of parents want to know where their kids are, what they are doing, and the idea is to have them in a safe environment where they can have coaches like myself who can look after and nurture their kids. ""Because let's face it some of the kids are from good backgrounds, bad backgrounds, no parents and we're here just to make sure these kids are in a safe environment and this is what we've achieved."""

Sir Philip Dilley has been criticised for taking the festive break, which came as Cumbria struggled to recover from the damage caused by Storm Desmond at the beginning of December and other parts of Britain faced a deluge of floodwater. As he arrived back at his London flat, he said he would be visiting Yorkshire later and would be ""very happy to speak"" with people affected by flooding. Asked if he should have visited the affected areas sooner, Sir Philip, who was noticeably tanned, said: ""Well I'm going up there today, as you appreciate. ""My focus really is to go and see what's happening, to see the good work that's been going on but most importantly to see the communities who have been affected."" Sir Philip said he had been ""in very close contact"" with senior EA staff throughout his break. When questioned further about his whereabouts during the floods, Sir Philip added: ""Everybody can't be everywhere at the same time. ""I think we've been very effective and efficient in what we've been doing. ""There's obviously some lessons to learn."" Gallery: Soldiers Brought In After Bridge In Tadcaster Collapses Troops were brought in to help evacuate homes in Tadcaster after part of a storm-battered bridge collapsed Officials are facing allegations of misleading the public as to the whereabouts of Sir Philip, who vowed to work six or seven days a week in times of crisis when he was interviewed by a Commons committee about his suitability for the role last year. The EA confirmed he had spent Christmas with his family on the Caribbean island, but would be back at work soon. In front of MPs last year, Sir Philip had criticised his predecessor at the EA, Lord Smith, for only visiting Somerset six weeks after parts of the county were devastated by floods in 2013. Sir Philip had visited Cumbria on 14 December, and in all EA statements released earlier this week, officials stressed he was ""available to participate in any necessary discussions"". However, one MP on the committee which appointed Sir Philip for the £100,000-a-year part-time role - which requires two to three days' work a week under normal circumstances - has said it is ""disappointing that he has not lived up to his own expectations"". Jim Fitzpatrick told The Daily Telegraph: ""I'm sure he will be asked questions about his absence when there was such a disaster unfolding right across the north."

The star, known as the feisty landlady Peggy Mitchell in EastEnders, is being given the honour for services to entertainment and charity. :: New Year's Honours - Who Else Has Been Recognised? The news was leaked over the weekend, and Dame Barbara told Sky News how she feels like the press has ""rained on her parade"" by bringing up her past and questioning whether or not she should receive the award. She said: ""Out of nowhere, after everyone was being so nice and congratulating you, all of a sudden people start pulling out a whole list of things, because I was honest in my book, a whole page of things that kind of knocks you as they're asking 'why would (the award) go to her?'. ""I just thought 'why do you want to rain on my parade?'"" She revealed that she wasn't expecting a further honour after being made an MBE, adding: ""For a little East End lady to be made a dame just for doing a job that she loves - that's a bit good isn't it?"" Dame Barbara, who is also well-known for her roles in the Carry On comedies of the 1960s and 1970s, launched this year's poppy campaign on behalf of the Royal British Legion, and has been involved in high-profile work with Age UK and Great Ormond Street Hospital. She said newspaper reports in recent days had upset her and taken the shine off the good news by describing her as an ""unlikely dame"". Gallery: Who Received What In New Year's Honours Tony McCoy said it was an ""unbelievable privilege"" as he was awarded a knighthood after being crowned champion jockey for a 20th consecutive year in 2015 When asked if she agrees, she said: ""Are you kidding? Some of the (existing) dames have got up to more naughty things than I have. ""It all comes out in the end, so at least it's come out at the beginning with me … it's all come out in the wash. ""I suppose I just wanted it all to be just wonderful with people saying 'yes she deserves it'. ""But I'm afraid the business isn't like that. I'm a nice lady and a good lady and I've worked hard all my life."" Dame Barbara began acting when she was 13 and has won two British Soap Awards as well as being nominated for a BAFTA.  A Buckingham Palace source was quoted in reports as saying: ""The Queen was delighted when Barbara's name was put forward. ""Like Her Majesty, she is someone who has been part of the fabric of the way of life in Britain for many years."""

Earlier, more than one million people gathered along Sydney's famed harbour to watch the 12-minute show featuring a multi-coloured firework ""waterfall"" cascading off the Harbour Bridge and pyrotechnic effects in the shapes of butterflies, octopuses and flowers. People crowded onto balconies, into waterside parks and onto boats as they jostled for the best view, clinking glasses and whooping with joy as the first fireworks went off. Thousands also gathered in Melbourne, where 11 tonnes of fireworks were set off. Security was tight across Australia, with thousands of extra police officers patrolling the country's major cities. :: New Year's Eve Armed Police For London In New Zealand, the first country with a sizeable population to celebrate the beginning of 2016, people counted down to midnight with a giant digital clock on Auckland's Sky Tower. Horns sounded and crowds cheered as the tower was then lit up with fireworks, with colours changing from green to red to white. Japan and South Korea kicked off their celebrations at 3pm UK time, with Hong Kong, Taiwan and China joining in an hour later. In Tokyo, many gathered to release balloons into the night sky and count the seconds down to midnight in front of the landmark Tokyo Tower. Gallery: New Year: Celebrations Across Globe For 2016 Revellers around the globe have been seeing in the New Year with spectacular ceremonies around the globe.

North Korea was expected to mark the New Year with a speech by leader Kim Jong-Un. In China an official celebration was planned near Beijing's Forbidden City, which will include performances and fireworks. A gala was also due to be held at the Bird's Nest stadium. Security was increased in Malaysia's biggest city, Kuala Lumpur, where fireworks rang in the New Year at a historical square as well as at the Petronas Twin Towers, one of the world's tallest towers. In the Philippines, stray bullets and exploding firecrackers killed one person and injured almost 200 others as the country celebrated the beginning of 2016. Three separate fireworks displays were set to wow spectators in Dubai. But just a few hours before the starting time, a huge fire broke out in a high-rise hotel near the Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building which is set to host a fireworks display. Burning debris rained down from the hotel, where the fire stretched at least 20 storeys, according to witnesses. But officials claimed there were no injuries and the New Year's Eve celebrations would still go ahead. Earlier the Burj Khalifa had been fitted with 400,000 LED lights and 1.6 tonnes of fireworks to be used in tonight's fireworks display. The Burj al Arab and the Dubai Marina were the other two venues set to host fireworks displays. Meanwhile, in London, extra armed officers have been called in to police the New Year's Eve celebrations later. Brussels cancelled its official fireworks display after two men were arrested by police and accused of plotting to attack the event in Belgium's capital. Paris also called off its traditional display in the Champs-Elysees as it remains on high alert following last month's terror attacks. Around one million revellers will converge on New York's Times Square for the annual celebration there. There will be musical acts to begin the event, followed fireworks and the descent of a glittering crystal ball from a rooftop flagpole. Officials in Las Vegas have urged people to leave bags, backpacks and buggies at home as police prepare for hundreds of thousands of partygoers to flood the Las Vegas Strip. The huge party on Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana Beach will have two themes: the 100th anniversary of samba music and the upcoming Olympics, which the Brazilian city will host in August. More than two million people are expected to converge on the beach. :: Watch live coverage of New Year's Eve celebrations in London from 10pm on Sky News."

Documents released by the National Archives show how the Prime Minister warned that telling teenagers about the dangers of ""risky sex"" could backfire and cause ""immense harm"". She backed down after advisers and ministers warned hundreds of thousands could be infected by the Aids virus if they failed to change their lifestyles. In 1986 - five years after the UK's first case was recorded - awareness of the disease was increasing. But Mrs Thatcher was not keen on health secretary Norman Fowler's plan for a newspaper campaign with advice on ""safe sex"". She scrawled in a note: ""Do we have to do the section on risky sex? I should have thought it could do immense harm if young teenagers were to read it. ""I think the anxiety on the part of parents and many teenagers who would never be in danger from Aids, exceeds the good it may do... adverts where every young person will read and hear of practices they never knew about will do harm."" Mr Fowler insisted that unless the advice was included - particularly in relation to gay men - the advert would lose ""all its medical authority and credibility."" When deputy prime minister William Whitelaw told her there was no support for her objections among other ministers she was forced to back down. She also objected - but later gave in - to Mr Fowler's suggestion of following up the adverts with information leaflets sent to every home in the country. The cabinet secretary, Sir Robert Armstrong, warned her: ""If there is no change in habits and practices, particularly but not exclusively among those currently most at risk (homosexual and bisexual men and drug misusers), there could at the end of five years be half a million infected carriers of whom a substantial number would subsequently develop the disease; and that is a sober estimate.""  Bernard Ingham, her trusted press secretary, added: ""There is certainly a feeling abroad that the Government is doing too little and is not treating the issue with sufficient urgency. ""There is also a feeling that the Prime Minister is acting as a brake on educational publicity."""
2015-12-31,Would-be suicide bomber Mohammed Rehman and his ex-wife Sana Ahmed Khan have been jailed for life after being convicted of planning a terror attack in London.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151231184652/http://news.sky.com/story/1614320/couple-jailed-over-7-7-anniversary-terror-plot,"Would-be suicide bomber Mohammed Rehman and his ex-wife Sana Ahmed Khan have been jailed for life after being convicted of planning a terror attack in London. Rehman had stockpiled bombmaking materials at his Reading home and using the Twitter username ""Silent Bomber"" he asked his followers which targets they thought suitable for a massive terror attack - Westfield shopping centre or the London Underground. He and Khan were sentenced after an Old Bailey jury unanimously found them guilty of preparing an act of terrorism in May this year. Rehman was told he must serve at least 27 years behind bars. Khan was given a minimum term of 25 years. The judge, Mr Justice Baker, said they were a significant danger to the public. The court heard Rehman had used a profile picture of 'Jihadi John' Mohammed Emwazi, when he posted on Twitter: ""Westfield shopping centre or London underground? Any advice would be appreciated greatly,"" accompanied by a link to an al Qaeda media release about the 7/7 bombings. Jurors were told that on the same day Rehman searched YouTube for ""London bombings"" and ""Shehzad Tanweer"" - one of the 7/7 bombers who he referred to as his ""beloved predecessor"". Prosecutors said Rehman, 25, proved he was ""intent on martyrdom"" when he also tweeted: ""Now I just make explosives in preparation for kuffar lol and when I've made the required amount I'll be wearing them on my chest."" The judge said the reason for his radicalisation might never be known, but could be linked to disaffection from his family and the wider community. He told Rehman: ""Once you had gained that mindset, you determined to fulfil the Islamic State's call for Jihad; not like some, by travelling to Syria or elsewhere to take part in the conflict in those areas, but by carrying out an act of terrorism within the United Kingdom. ""The type of act which you envisaged not only encompassed the use of explosive substances which would be used to maximum effect so as to cause multiple injuries and fatalities, but specifically included a suicide bombing, an act which envisaged martyrdom."" Gallery: Jury Shown Evidence Of London Terror Plot Images of evidence in the trial of a couple convicted of plotting a terror attack in London were shown in court Khan, 24, was convicted of helping her husband plan the atrocity and paying for chemicals purchased from eBay, including more than 10kg of urea nitrate, a fertiliser-based high explosive discovered at the couple's home, which had the potential to cause ""multiple fatalities"". Ahead of the hearing, Khan sent the judge a hand-written letter saying she had divorced Rehman a couple of weeks previously and that she should have ""distanced myself from him a long time ago"" but did not have the strength. But the judge rejected her excuses and said she encouraged Rehman to pursue Islamic State ideology and also wanted to ""fulfil the Islamic State's call for jihad"". The couple, separated by two prison guards in the dock, were expressionless and stared straight ahead as they were sentenced."

The quintessentially British gin and tonic is now so popular, dedicated bars are popping up all around the UK. Customers at The London Gin Club bar in Soho described it as ""very refreshing"" and ""my go-to drink"". Britain is now the biggest exporter of gin in the world - with international sales up 37% in the past five years. The Wine and Spirit Trade Association also estimates UK sales figures for the past two years at £150 million - an increase of 20%. A total of 73 new distilleries were set up in the UK between 2010 and 2014 - with 56 set up in the past two years. Sky News has visited Sipsmith Distillery which, in 2009, was the first new copper still to launch in London in over 200 years. Co-founder Sam Galsworthy says: ""I don't think we could have ever dreamt of seeing the growth and explosion of gin we've seen in the past five years."" ""We sell in 35 different countries, exports is 25% of the business and it pretty much doubles every year."" The drink had its first boom in the 18th century, when it was blamed for a causing a crisis of drunkenness and debauchery.

The 30-year epidemic inspired the famous Hogarth painting Gin Lane. Alcohol historian Jane Peyton says the industry has successfully shaken off the spirits reputation as ""mother's ruin"". She says: ""It's had an image overhaul, a 360-degree turn on who drinks it, where they drink it and why they drink it."" ""Nowadays there are laws regulating how gin can be made and what it contains. In the early days during the gin frenzy and the gin craze there were no laws as such so you could put anything into gin, poisons, toxics and it didn't taste the way it did now for sure."" Alcohol has re-emerged as a health issue with concerns about its impact on heart disease, stroke risk, blood pressure and cancers - but the popularity of gin seems to continue to increase."
2015-12-31,"David Cameron's current policy chief, Oliver Letwin, has apologised for any offence caused by ""deeply racist"" remarks he made following the Broadwater Farm riots of 1985.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151231184652/http://news.sky.com/story/1614033/top-tory-apologises-over-racist-riot-remarks,"David Cameron's current policy chief, Oliver Letwin, has apologised for any offence caused by ""deeply racist"" remarks he made following the Broadwater Farm riots of 1985. Newly-released files from the National Archives show that Mr Letwin - then an adviser to Margaret Thatcher - said ""bad moral attitudes"" were responsible for major unrest in mainly black inner-city areas, rather than urban deprivation. He also dismissed ministers' proposals to encourage a new class of black entrepreneurs, because they would simply establish businesses in the ""disco and drug trade"". In a document co-written with Hartley Booth, who also went on to be a Tory MP, Mr Letwin wrote: ""The root of social malaise is not poor housing, or youth 'alienation', or the lack of a middle class. ""Lower-class, unemployed white people lived for years in appalling slums without a breakdown of public order on anything like the present scale. ""Riots, criminality and social disintegration are caused solely by individual characters and attitudes. ""So long as bad moral attitudes remain, all efforts to improve the inner cities will founder."" :: The Top Oliver Letwin Gaffes Police officers in riot gear on the Broadwater Farm housing estate The major disturbances, which erupted in the autumn of 1985, were among the worst in recent British history - and included riots in Birmingham, Brixton and Broadwater Farm in Tottenham, north London, where Pc Keith Blakelock was stabbed to death. Those troubles were widely blamed on a combination of slum housing, high levels of unemployment and poor education. In a statement, Mr Letwin - now a minister in the Cabinet Office - said: ""I want to make clear that some parts of a private memo I wrote nearly 30 years ago were both badly worded and wrong. ""I apologise unreservedly for any offence these comments have caused and wish to make clear that none was intended."" David Lammy, a Labour MP who grew up alongside the Broadwater Farm estate, described Mr Letwin's comments as ""breathtaking"". He said: ""It had nothing to do with moral bankruptcy and everything to do with social decay and the appalling relations between black youths and the police. ""Letwin's statement is an indication of how the powerful can be so utterly, utterly out of touch with what's going on."" Labour deputy leader Tom Watson had called on the minister to apologise and said: ""Oliver Letwin's comments are evidence of an ignorant and deeply racist view of the world."" He added: ""A great many people will be asking whether, as a Government minister, he still holds such offensive and divisive views."" In response to the criticism of Mr Letwin's remarks, a Cabinet Office spokesman explained that the government of the time had been ""proposing solutions to rebuild broken communities"". Officials have described the controversial memo as a ""historical document"" written by a policy team which had been tasked with challenging ""orthodox views"". :: Police feared protesters could try to acquire napalm in the aftermath of the Broadwater Farm riots for use in further disturbances, according to other papers released by the National Archives. Margaret Thatcher was warned that ""small quantities"" of the ""rare"" ingredients used to make the incendiary agent had been bought from a north London chemist. The claims were played down by Mrs Thatcher's private secretary Mark Addison, saying ""rumours are everywhere and it's very difficult to separate fact from fiction""."
2015-12-31,Amy Wade flirts online with a man she has never met.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151231184652/http://news.sky.com/story/1614060/inside-the-world-of-the-online-honey-trappers,"By Tom Platt, Sky News Reporter Amy Wade flirts online with a man she has never met. She added him on Facebook, struck up a conversation, and now they speak every day. They are flirtatious and intimate - he talks about his children, his job, but never his wife. What he does not realise is that Amy is setting a cyber honey trap. She has been paid by the man's partner - £30 for a week's services - to tempt him to cheat. ""I think these people deserve to be exposed,"" Amy says. ""If you want to be in a relationship with someone then stay in that relationship, if you want to go around then do, but don't mix the two."" At the end of the week, she will send a report to his spouse and break off all conversation. She will never meet him, and probably never speak to him again. Amy is part of a new generation of online honey trappers. Taking advantage of the growth of social media, investigative businesses are now offering these internet services to suspicious partners. The trappers - some called ""investigators"", others called ""honeys"" - are paid to test the fidelity of a target. Over the course of a conversation honeys say they are often sent explicit messages - including pictures - and are asked to meet. Amy says that  the majority of men she speaks to will take the bait. At another company, new recruits are being specifically trained in how to target both men and women online. Jade, a trainee investigator, is learning the ropes. She says: ""I've personally been cheated on, and it was a really horrific experience, so you don't want other women to go through it."" Sat in front of a laptop, she says: ""I'm learning how to create a fake Facebook profile, I have to be very generic... learning how not to give anything away."" The well-established business she works for - with 42 investigators on its books - has had to temporarily offer reduced rates to compete in this growing market. The boss, Rebecca Jane, accepts her business is making money out of mistrust, but she argues it is providing a service that is in demand. She says: ""Morally I don't think it's a correct thing to do. But it's not my place to say to a client that they're wrong, if this service can give them some peace of mind"" But therapists are warning these services are detrimental to relationships. They advise counselling, or simply talking, as more productive ways of getting to the bottom of your concerns. And they warn that the partner who has paid for the service has also betrayed the trust of the relationship - by trying to entrap their other half. ""It's one thing to discover your partner is unfaithful, it's another to set your partner up to be unfaithful,"" says psychotherapist Dr Sheri Jacobson. ""I think it adds another dimension in terms of being sly and manipulative."""

The obstacles have been left on unlit sections of road and have already caused thousands of pounds' worth of damage to four cars and a bus. According to officers, there have been nine incidents reported in the area of Tiptree, southwest of Colchester, in just over a week. Chief Inspector Nick Lee said: ""The first couple of reports of items found were thought to be debris that had fallen in the road, but it is now clear that there has been a pattern to these incidents and the items have been deliberately placed in the road with the intention of causing danger to motorists. ""We have been very fortunate so far that no motorists or other road users have been injured but the damage caused to vehicles has been significant, and it is only down to luck that we have not ended up having to deal with a serious incident."" He added: ""The stupidity involved in carrying out these acts beggars belief and I want to catch those responsible as soon as possible."" According to the East Anglian Daily Times, officers urgently want to speak to two white men, aged 20 to 30, seen wearing camouflage trousers and an orange and grey top. They also want to speak to a woman, aged 20 to 30, wearing black and grey clothes. And police are asking anyone who sees anything suspicious to contact them. Chief Insp Lee said: ""If they find any debris in the road then I would ask them to call us as soon as it is safe to do so on 101, or 999 in an emergency."""
