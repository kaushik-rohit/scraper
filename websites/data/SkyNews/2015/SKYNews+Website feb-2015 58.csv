Josephoartigasia monesi lived around three million years ago and was the size of a buffalo. Experts believe it used its giant teeth to dig for food and defend itself from predators. Lead scientist Dr Philip Cox, from the University of York, said: ""This is very similar to how a modern day elephant uses its tusks."" The animal was around the size of a buffalo The experts used computer simulation methods to estimate how powerful a bite it had. A scan was made of a Josephoartigasia monesi specimen before a virtual reconstruction of its skull was created. Engineering techniques were then used to discover the bite had a force of around 1,400 Newtons - about the same as that of a tiger."

It will return at 10am to continue deliberating over the child sex offences the former glam rock star faces at Southwark Crown Court. Glitter, whose real name is Paul Gadd, faces 10 charges. He is accused of attempted rape and an indecent assault on a girl under the age of 13 in 1975. The former star denies the charges He is also accused of four counts of indecent assault on a second complainant and of giving the same child alcohol with the intention to ""stupefy or overpower"" her to have sex with him between January and May of the same year. It’s also alleged that Gadd had unlawful intercourse with the girl. The 70-year-old also faces two charges of indecent assault against a third person between October 1979 and December 1980. He denies all the charges against him. While giving evidence, Gadd told the court he had no interest in sexually abusing young girls. He had previously admitted possessing sexual images of children and was jailed for the offence in 1999. The jury were warned by the judge not to allow that to influence their decision in this trial. Gadd was the first person to be arrested by detectives working on Operation Yewtree, the inquiry which was set up following the Jimmy Savile scandal."
2015-02-05,A carjacker has been captured on CCTV stealing a woman's Mini from her own driveway – and dragging her into a busy main road as she clings on to try and stop him.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150205102404/http://news.sky.com/story/1421210/cctv-shows-carjacker-dragging-woman-into-road,"A carjacker has been captured on CCTV stealing a woman's Mini from her own driveway – and dragging her into a busy main road as she clings on to try and stop him. Nikki Law-Priddey had left the engine running to de-ice her car when the opportunistic thief sprinted into view and jumped into the driver's seat. As the criminal began to drive off, the 30-year-old opened the car door in an attempt to seize control of the £16,200 vehicle. But moments later, she slipped underneath the wheels and lost her grip, leaving her abandoned in the middle of the road. The victim claims she was 'left for dead' in the middle of the road On Facebook, Ms Priddey wrote: ""To say I am in total shock and disbelief about what happened to me on my own doorstep, in broad daylight, is an understatement. ""My car has been recovered by the police and is in forensics. Do not leave your car running to de-ice it – scum like this wait for people just like me to make this mistake. ""Never in a million years did I think this would happen to me."" The business developer, from Birmingham, was left with a broken hand and bruising after the ordeal. Since she began appealing for witnesses on social media, West Midlands Police have arrested a 25-year-old man on suspicion of robbery. A spokesman said: ""We'd like to remind people there are always opportunistic thieves around looking for an easy steal, and not to leave cars unlocked and unattended with keys in the ignition."""

King Abdullah has cut short a visit to Washington in order to fly home, as protesters in Amman demand revenge for the killing of Mu'ath Al Kassasbeh, who burned alive in a cage by IS militants. The country executed two prisoners after the video was published online. One of them was the Iraqi would-be suicide bomber Sajida al Rishawi, who Jordan had offered to release if Al Kassasbeh was returned safely. Jordan promised a swift response to Mr Al Kassasbeh's murder But there was no forthcoming proof that the hostage was still alive, and the Jordanian military now believes that he was killed on 3 January. Safi, the pilot's father, said he ""considers Mu'ath a martyr to God"", and called on the Jordanian government ""to take revenge for Mu'ath's blood"". Gallery: Everything We Know About Sajida Al Rishawi Sajida Al Rishawi, believed to be in her 40s, was known as the 'would-be bomber'. She was executed in Jordan following the murder by IS of Jordanian pilot Mu'ath Al Kassasbeh He added: ""The blood of Mu'ath is this country's blood. The country has to take its revenge, and I call for no one to remain alive from Islamic State, I call for revenge by executing prisoners, and I call to erase the (Islamic State) organisation."" There has been widespread condemnation of the fighter pilot's death, with Saudi Arabia's new King Salman describing his murder as ""inhuman and contrary to Islam"". Meanwhile, an Egyptian university revered by Sunni Muslims around the world has expressed ""deep anger over the lowly terrorist act"". Since news of his death emerged, #IAmMuath has been trending on Twitter, with protesters chanting the slogan outside King Abdullah's palace in Amman. Mr Al Kassasbeh was captured by the militants in December when his F-16 crashed near Raqqa, Syria, the de facto capital of the Islamic State group's self-styled caliphate. The 26-year-old's murder appeared to be aimed at pressuring the government of Jordan - a close US ally - to leave the coalition that has carried out months of airstrikes on IS positions in Syria and Iraq. But observers say the extremists' brutality against a fellow Muslim could backfire and galvanise other Sunni Muslims in the region against them. In a speech on Jordanian state television, King Abdullah has urged his countrymen to unite. ""It's the duty of all of us to stand united and show the real values of Jordanians in the face of these hardships,"" the monarch said from Washington. In a statement before a meeting King Abdullah, US President Barack Obama vowed the pilot's death would ""redouble the vigilance and determination on the part of our global coalition to make sure they are degraded and ultimately defeated""."

The reason people don't engage with politics is because of apathy, not because of how we vote. We need to engage people more through social media, which would help break down the disillusionment - that should be the priority. I'm really excited about my first time voting because of the momentum that's been building up. I've become more politically aware and the fact that I can make a difference in this little way is really significant to me. It's also really exciting being in a marginal seat like Hendon. I can really make a big difference. I wouldn't say there was huge awareness of voter registration. I had to search it out myself, it wasn't readily available to me, but that's changing with Stand Up Be Counted because when you register you can register to vote. It's a really good initiative. It's right there online so it's much easier and that can help us break down the barriers to registering to vote ahead of General Election day. Online voting would send a message that politics and government are changing. I think we're in this revolution where social media is omnipresent, so if online voting was available it would make everything easier."

Conrad Hilton III was shackled by his hands and ankles in a Los Angeles court on Tuesday where he faced a charge of interfering with a flight crew. The 20-year-old, who could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted, did not enter a plea and was released on $100,000 (£65,000) bail. The grandson of the Hilton Hotels chain founder had to be restrained by attendants on Flight 269 from London to Los Angeles on 31 July last year, according to court documents. The defendant's older sister is socialite and TV personaility Paris Hilton His alleged erratic behaviour began soon after take-off when he ignored instructions to keep his seatbelt fastened and began walking up and down the aisle. He continued to cause concern for almost the entire flight of more than 10 hours, according to an FBI affidavit. Hilton complained that a male passenger was ""giving him the stink eye"". He also said he was angry over a breakup with a girlfriend. At one point, he went to a toilet and the smell of marijuana wafted out, the affidavit said. When confronted by the co-pilot, Hilton allegedly ran to another bathroom and smoked a cigarette. Children cried during Hilton's alleged antics on Flight 269. File pic Paper towel was found stuffed in the smoke detector. As flight crew remonstrated with him, Hilton accused them of ""taking the peasants' side"", according to the court documents. Witnesses said he added that he would ""[f******] own anyone on this flight, they are [f******] peasants"". Children cried as Hilton's profanity-filled tirades escalated, authorities say. He threw a punch inches from a flight attendant's head that struck the bulkhead, according to the affidavit. Hilton allegedly told the co-pilot: ""If you wanna square up to me, bro, then bring it on and I will [f******] fight you."" According to the criminal complaint, Hilton shouted that his career as a model would be ""ruined"", as a team of five flight crew held him down. He threatened to kill several of the flight attendants, the affidavit states. Hilton also allegedly said: ""I could get you all fired in five minutes. I know your boss. My father will pay this out, he has done it before. Dad paid $300,000 last time."" He eventually fell asleep and was handcuffed to his seat for the remaining 90 minutes of flight. Hilton family lawyer Robert Shapiro said outside court his client may have been suffering from the side effects of a sleeping pill. The defendant was ordered to appear for arraignment on 5 March."
2015-02-05,The chairman of the inquiry into the Iraq War has said he is unable to say when his long-awaited report will be published.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150205102404/http://news.sky.com/story/1421097/iraq-inquiry-report-out-as-soon-as-possible,"The chairman of the inquiry into the Iraq War has said he is unable to say when his long-awaited report will be published. Sir John Chilcot faced questions from MPs on the Foreign Affairs Committee about why the document has yet to be released. He said the aim is to release it ""as soon as we possibly can"". The draft report is said to be around one million words in length, and more than £9m has been spent on the inquiry. The inquiry, which was set up in 2009, heard evidence from its last witness in 2011. Concluding the public evidence sessions four years ago, Sir John said it would take ""some months"" to write the conclusions. David Cameron is among those who have expressed frustration at the delay, and last week some MPs demanded that the existing text and key evidence be handed over to be published immediately. In his opening statement, Sir John said: ""My committee and I want, and intend, to deliver our report to the Prime Minister as soon as we possibly can. ""But as I said to the Prime Minister ... I see no realistic prospect of doing so before the General Election. ""We have to maintain the principles by which we have operated throughout: fairness, thoroughness and impartiality. ""It is our duty to deliver a report which gives the Government, Parliament, the public, and particularly all those who have been deeply affected by events in Iraq, the answers they deserve."" He told MPs part of the reason for the delay is the Maxwellisation Process - the practice of giving those due to be criticised in a report time to respond. Sir John defended the time it has taken for the report to be finalised, saying it was a ""massive task"" of ""constructing a reliable account"" based on information that was ""interlinked by a web of advice, discussion and debate"". ""Quite difficult exchanges"" about the release of Government documents had also held up publication, he said. The finger for the delay has often been pointed at Tony Blair, who was Prime Minister at the time of the conflict. But Mr Blair has repeatedly insisted that he has nothing to do it, and Sir John told MPs: ""As of today I don't think anyone involved in the Maxwellisation process is seeking to spin it out."" Sir John quipped that he had ""tried very hard not to rue"" the day he accepted the job.

None of us thought it would take this long. ""We want to get it done but we are not going to get it done by scamping the work or failing in the essential principles we have set ourselves."" At the start of the hearing it was revealed that panel member Sir Martin Gilbert died on Tuesday. Sir John said the inquiry had benefited from the historian's ""wisdom and insights""."

In a statement headlined ""US imperialists will face final doom"", the National Defence Commission (NDC), North Korea's top military organisation also ruled out face-to-face negotiations with Washington. The rhetoric appears to be a reaction to US president Barack Obama last month describing North Korea as the ""most cut-off nation on Earth"" and speaking about the regime's eventual collapse. Describing the Obama administration as a ""cesspool"", the NDC  said the president's remarks were a threat to bring on North Korea's downfall.  ""Since the gangster-like US imperialists are blaring that they will 'bring down' the DPRK (North Korea) ... the army and people of the DPRK cannot but officially notify the Obama administration ... that the DPRK has neither need nor willingness to sit at negotiating table with the US any longer,"" the statement said. Gallery: Kim Jong-Un Inspecting Things North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un makes regular public appearances across the country It added that the North was capable of bringing about the ""final ruin of the US"" with its ""precision and diversified nuclear striking means"". North Korea is known to have a capable cyber warfare unit, which was blamed for the hacking of Sony Pictures' computer network over the production of The Interview. The comedy, in which two journalists travel to the country to interview its leader Kim Jong-Un but are recruited by the CIA to assassinate him, caused a revival in tensions between North Korea and the West. The statement came after reported discussions about the idea of reviving de-nuclearisation talks between Washington and Pyongyang broke down. North Korea carried out nuclear tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013.  It also comes weeks before the beginning of annual US-South Korea military exercises, which usually cause a surge in tensions in the divided peninsula. Gallery: Sky News On China's North Korea Border Sky News has filmed rare pictures across the Chinese border into North Korea. The images demonstrate the poverty inside the country and the degree to which China cooperates with its old ally North Korea claims these are rehearsals for an invasion, while South Korea and the US say they are purely defensive. US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said that Washington's position had not changed and that it ""continues to offer Pyongyang an improved bilateral relationship"" provided it takes action on de-nuclearisation."

Police in Aspen, Colorado, said Hansen told them she struck the two cars after losing control of Armstrong's sport utility vehicle. Armstrong was stripped of his record seven Tour de France titles But she later came clean, telling authorities she and Armstrong agreed to let her take the blame to avoid national attention. Armstrong has not commented on the incident. The record seven-time Tour de France winner was stripped of his medals after admitting to doping in an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2013.

2015-02-05,"Laurence Wheeler, a 61-year-old survivor of sexual abuse from Kent, explains what the inquiry into historical child abuse within the British Establishment means to him:",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150205102404/http://news.sky.com/story/1421443/child-abuse-survivor-we-must-expose-horrors,"Laurence Wheeler, a 61-year-old survivor of sexual abuse from Kent, explains what the inquiry into historical child abuse within the British Establishment means to him: As an adult survivor of childhood abuse, I am pleased that an inquiry into historical child abuse allegations has at last been set up. With a background of cover-ups and deception, it is essential to have an open and independent panel and chair, to fully publish their findings with complete clarity. For this to happen it is essential that the inquiry has statutory powers to compel witnesses to give evidence, and that exemption from the Official Secrets Act and other impediments are removed. Justice Lowell Goddard is the new chair of the child abuse inquiry This inquiry is groundbreaking in its scope. It is a very important step towards the de-tabooing of a taboo subject that ruins so many lives. The exposure of child abuse within the Establishment sector is something that had previously been considered as unthinkable. In reality it is more than thinkable - it is a fact.  The assumption that child abuse doesn't, and would never, happen in the upper echelons of society has, at long, long last, been exposed as a complete fallacy. After so many years and so many denials, we now know it did happen and it happened big time. Now we have the opportunity to expose it fully. The present Establishment needs this to happen in order that they can clean out their historical horrors to maintain their credibility. It needs to happen, so that confidence in the process of protecting our children can be maintained and improved. It needs to happen for the survivors who need to see the perpetrators of this insidious crime punished. And it needs to take place in the public domain and to be as open as possible. The Home Secretary's statement to the House was full and encouraging. The appointment of Justice Lowell Goddard to head the inquiry is a welcome step forward. She would appear to be well qualified and has the support and experience to carry the job through. The concern from a survivor's viewpoint is that everything contained in the statement now happens and that justice is done and seen to be done. Child abuse is a crime that inflicts long-term, permanent injury on its victims for which there is no cure. Survival is a question of degree and survivors often face an uphill struggle to come to terms with what has happened to them. Many struggle without ever getting resolution or recognition of their problems. They need to know they are not rejected and discarded, as so many have experienced, and that their plight and injury is recognised as being serious, damaging and life altering. Because of the present culture of more openness, many victims of abuse are now coming forward with disclosures where previously they would not have done. I have suffered from the effects of childhood abuse from the age of four and know first-hand how destructive and negative a force it can be. This is, to quote the Home Secretary, a ""once in a generation opportunity"" and it is vital that we get it right. What survivors want is the recognition that wrong was done to them and that help is available. Obviously there are concerns about how this inquiry goes forward and it raises many questions but we should wait and see how it develops before judging. That said, issues like limiting the inquiry to 1970, missing files and previous cover ups all need addressing urgently. I personally know two people whose abuse occurred in the 1950/60s whose experiences will not be considered with the present remit. One can only hope that this inquiry will actually do what it says on the tin."
2015-02-05,"Perhaps the most damning line in a report full of damnation was simply this: ""Rotherham does not learn, even in the most tragic circumstances.""",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150205102404/http://news.sky.com/story/1421571/damning-report-for-council-in-denial,"Perhaps the most damning line in a report full of damnation was simply this: ""Rotherham does not learn, even in the most tragic circumstances."" The mass cabinet resignation reflects the pure inability of the leadership to deal with the problem of child sexual exploitation (CSE) in Rotherham, or even face up to it. It was a council ""in denial,"" report author Louise Casey concluded. Despite three high profile resignations back in August last year following an investigation by Alexis Jay, 70% of remaining councillors hadn't accepted the findings of the Jay report which found 1,400 children had been sexually exploited, mostly by Asian gangs. Louise Casey's report was scathing about Rotherham Council and police Louise Casey states: ""When Professor Jay brought forward the undeniable and cohesive facts of CSE in Rotherham, her report was met with denial and challenge."" Casey says Jay's 1,400 figure was a ""conservative estimate"" and found that despite the denials the council was unable to produce its own figures. Gallery: Who's Who in The Rotherham Abuse Scandal Roger Stone - Leader of Rotherham Borough Council from 2003 to 2014. Resigned when the report was published in August last year. The head of the Government's Troubled Families Unit also raised concerns about the honesty of officials. In a remarkable revelation she states that some councillors did not pay their council tax bills until receiving orders from the magistrates' court. Casey also highlighted a case of ""missing laptops"" that held large amounts of data on children. The report claims the council ""did cover up the scale of the loss known at the time"". And so, at a time when central government is trying to avoid intervention in local politics, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said it was ""with a heavy heart"" that he had to remove a ""wholly dysfunctional cabinet"". There will be new elections in 2016 but until then, five commissioners will take over a number of key duties, which include looking after children's and young people's services and adult social care, as well as taxi licensing. But this is just the first step in combating an institution found to be ""not fit for purpose"" with a culture of ""bullying, sexism, suppression and misplaced political correctness"". During a Sky News investigation broadcast last week, we found outreach services that tried to highlight the problem had been ignored despite reporting hundreds of child grooming cases to different authorities within the council. Casey's report concurs that: ""Many of those raising the problem of CSE with the council did not do so quietly. There were reports to senior staff, to members, to scrutiny committees, to safeguarding boards. ""There were externally commissioned reports about CSE that were not acted upon."" This can't all be blamed on the leadership. Rotherham also needs services that are fit for purpose - and the purpose is huge and complex, requiring a great deal of expertise. Louise Casey laments the closure of the ""groundbreaking"" youth project Risky Business, which it described as ""critical to the success of Operation Central"" that led to the conviction of five men for offences including rape and other sexual offences with children. This project gained the trust of victims and understood the complexities of child grooming. Yet, Sky News found that a new outreach project proposed by the former manager of Risky Business was recently denied funding by the council. The Casey report states that ""Street grooming is insidious and needs a more nuanced approach to get girls to understand what is happening to them and to tell their story. ""This is where outreach workers have a vital role to play but an effective outreach programme is not in place."" To achieve this, the new commissioners will need a great deal of cash behind them and the Department for Communities and Local Government has yet to make clear the levels of investment that it is prepared to make. What's more, there is a whole other issue to be addressed, covered in the Casey report under the title ""Where were the Police?"" If you are looking for more shocking lines in this report go no further. One story is of a victim's paperwork being ripped up by a police officer as she is told ""Nothing good will come of it"". Another officer allegedly told a victim: ""Don’t worry - you aren't the first girl to be raped by XX and you won't be the last."" The report finds victims were threatened with wasting police time, told they had consented to sex and, on occasion, were arrested at the scene of a crime, rather than the perpetrators. The Independent Police Complaints Commission is currently investigating 10 officers and the National Crime Agency is considering which abuse cases it will take over from South Yorkshire Police, and confirmed it is making investigations into potential criminality within the council reported to them by Louise Casey. It is clear that Rotherham has a huge task ahead but as the Casey report states: ""It is not at all clear that Rotherham has identified who and where the victims are, what their current needs are, and what services they may require in the future."""
2015-02-05,New Zealand high court judge Justice Lowell Goddard has been named as the latest chair of the troubled child abuse inquiry.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150205102404/http://news.sky.com/story/1421180/new-zealand-judge-to-chair-child-abuse-inquiry,"New Zealand high court judge Justice Lowell Goddard has been named as the latest chair of the troubled child abuse inquiry. Home Secretary Theresa May said in a statement to MPs that a new statutory inquiry will be established, meaning the current panel will be dissolved. Current members have been encouraged to reapply for their roles, and the panel has been asked to produce a report on its work so far. The terms of reference are also being looked at, meaning that the investigations could potentially go back beyond 1970. However, Mrs May suggested the remit is unlikely to be extended beyond England and Wales The Home Secretary said she was ""more determined than ever"" to expose those who had failed victims, and thanked survivors ""for their patience, their determination and their willingness to help us get this right"". The first chair of the inquiry was Baroness Butler-Sloss, who stood down in July amid questions over the role of her late brother, Lord Havers, who was attorney general in the 1980s. Her replacement, Dame Fiona Woolf, resigned after criticism of her links to the establishment, most notably in relation to former home secretary Leon Brittan, who died last month. The inquiry will be put on a statutory footing under the 2005 Inquiries Act, Mrs May confirmed, with the power to compel witnesses to give evidence. Mrs May said she had spoken with many victims since making her last statement on the issue, and that she was ""grateful to all of them"" for speaking out. ""I am now more determined than ever to expose the people behind these despicable crimes and the people in institutions that knew about abuse but didn't act, that failed to help when it was their duty, sometimes their very purpose to do so,"" she said. ""And the people and institutions that in some cases positively covered up evidence of abuse."" While Mrs May conceded ""not every survivor"" would agree with what has been announced, she said there was a great deal of consensus on what the inquiry needed. Mrs May also confirmed that a previously top-secret file containing allegations of ""unnatural sexual behaviour"", that named the late British diplomat Sir Peter Hayman, was not seen by a probe into the Home Office's handling of historic sex abuse claims. She said the Cabinet Office file was similar to a Home Office file that was examined by the review, but confirmed it had additional information. Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who has been campaigning on the issue, told Sky News he welcomed the appointment of Justice Goddard and said it ""looks like a good appointment"". Alison Millar, from the law firm Leigh Day, which is representing some of the victims, said: ""We are very pleased to see that the inquiry will have a much wider remit and the power to compel witnesses to give evidence. ""Clearly a lot of thought has gone into the choice of chairperson and it is a brave step by the Home Secretary to appoint a non-UK based judge to oversee this essential inquiry."" Ben Emmerson QC will continue as the inquiry's legal counsel. He said: ""Justice Goddard has all the key qualities necessary to lead the Inquiry's work - absolute independence from the executive, a proven track record of holding state and non-state institutions to account, and the forensic skills necessary to digest and analyse vast quantities of evidence."" Justice Goddard will appear before the Home Affairs Select Committee for a pre-appointment hearing next Wednesday. :: A survivor of child abuse tells Sky News what the inquiry into historical child abuse within the British Establishment means to him."

More than 750 passengers are thought to have been aboard the train. ""I was trapped,"" commuter Justin Kaback told ABC News. ""You know there was people in front of me and behind me, and I was trapped in the middle of a car and it was getting very hot. ""All the air was turned off so there was no circulation so it was definitely scary especially when people are walking by on the outside and they said, 'The train's on fire. There's a fire.'"" Another passenger told reporters he was sitting near the back of the train when he felt a ""small jolt"". Neil Rader said: ""It felt not even like a short stop, and then the train just completely stopped."" He said frantic passengers had to evacuate by breaking glass on the doors to get out, and that he saw 50 to 60 ambulances at the scene. ""I've never seen anything quite like it,"" he added. Around 400 of the passengers who evacuated the train were taken to a local rock climbing gym for shelter. Buses were sent to the centre to pick them up and take them to their destinations. Metro-North is the nation's second-busiest railroad, after the Long Island Rail Road. It was formed in 1983 and serves around 280,000 passengers a day in New York and Connecticut.

They will leave their posts ""as soon as transitional arrangements can be put in place"", according to a statement. The political leadership, branded ""wholly dysfunctional"" by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, will be replaced by government commissioners, who will be tasked with improving standards at the authority. Early elections will also be held. The inquiry was set up to assess Rotherham council's ability to handle revelations that 1,400 girls were subjected to sexual abuse over a period of 16 years. It found that: ""In particular, it is failing in its duties to protect vulnerable children and young people from harm."" Louise Casey's report was published as it was claimed a police officer and two local politicians have been accused of having sex with underage girls in Rotherham.  The Independent Police Complaints Commission would not confirm that it had received an allegation of sexual abuse by a police constable but said that so far there had been 20 complaints against ten South Yorkshire officers in relation to their handling of the child sexual exploitation investigation in the South Yorkshire town. Rotherham's entire council cabinet has resigned The National Crime Agency also refused to say if it was investigating two councillors but said it was expanding its investigation in light of the new findings. The report described an ""unhealthy"" culture within the South Yorkshire authority, with evidence of sexism, bullying and suppressing bad news.

It also cited difficulties within the council when dealing with issues of race and said it has been damaged by ""misplaced political correctness"".  The report blames those difficulties for fuelling racial tensions and support for the far-right. It also found that 21 laptops, some containing details of victims of abuse and possible offenders, were stolen in October 2011 with no sign of a break in. Rotherham Council is ""incapable of tackling its weaknesses without a sustained intervention"", Ms Casey concluded. The inquiry also endorsed the findings of a previous investigation carried out last year by an expert in child care, Professor Alexis Jay and criticised councillors for rejecting it. That report made headlines around the world after finding that girls had been beaten by groups of men in Rotherham and in some cases forced to witness the rape of other victims.  She wrote: ""In just over a third of cases, children affected by sexual exploitation were previously known to services because of child protection and neglect. ""It is hard to describe the appalling nature of the abuse that child victims suffered. They were raped by multiple perpetrators, trafficked to other towns and cities in the north of England, abducted, beaten, and intimidated. ""There were examples of children who had been doused in petrol and threatened with being set alight, threatened with guns, made to witness brutally violent rapes and threatened they would be next if they told anyone. ""Girls as young as 11 were raped by large numbers of male perpetrators.""  Most of the men involved were of Pakistani origin. Professor Jay also said that the collective failures of political and administrative leaders had been ""blatant."""
2015-02-05,"""Mayday, Mayday, engine flameout"", were the pilot's final words from a stricken Taiwanese plane, according to air traffic control.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150205102404/http://news.sky.com/story/1421036/pilot-mayday-mayday-engine-flameout,"""Mayday, Mayday, engine flameout"", were the pilot's final words from a stricken Taiwanese plane, according to air traffic control. The words came moments before the TransAsia Airways plane crashed into the Keelung River, having taken off from Taipei's Songshan Airport. Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration said 31 people were killed, a number were injured and 12 were still missing. Thirty-one of the 58 on board were reported to be from China. A flameout is when the fuel supply to the engine is interrupted or there are combustion problems which result in engine failure. Twin-engined planes, however, are usually able to fly on one engine. Meanwhile, 28 passengers appear to have had a miraculous escape, with Wu Jun-hong of Taipei's Fire Department telling reporters that children were among those rescued. He said: ""There are adults taking care of toddlers. They are safe. ""Children were rescued from the plane already. We get them out from the river using the boat."" Television footage showed survivors wearing life jackets wading and swimming clear of the wreckage, which was surrounded by rubber boats. Others, including a young child, were taken to safety by rescuers, who could also be seen pulling carry-on luggage from an open door. As night drew in and drizzle fell, military crews reached the scene with portable bridges and hundreds of rescue workers built docks for easier access to the wreckage.  Relatives of the victims have not yet reached the scene but some are expected to arrive on Thursday, including many flying from Beijing. The 72-seat plane - an ATR 72-600 - was received by TransAsia last year and is one of the most popular turboprop planes in the world. Gallery: Rescue Operation Following Plane Crash Workers hoist the wreckage of a TransAsia passenger jet that crashed into a river shortly after takeoff in Taipei, Taiwan The pilot had 4,916 hours of flying experience and the co-pilot had 6,922 hours, according to the head of Taiwan's civil aviation authority Lin Tyh-ming. The aircraft last underwent maintenance on 26 January, he added. This tragedy comes just seven months after a TransAsia ATR 72-500 crashed while trying to land at Penghu Island, killing 48 of the 58 passengers and crew on board. With that record in mind, investigators into the crash are likely to focus on cockpit procedures and maintenance at the airline, said Greg Waldron, Asia managing editor at Flightglobal. He added: ""Coming so soon after July's crash, the airline could come under intense scrutiny by regulators, not to mention the impact this will have on public perceptions of the carrier."" Other possible factors include pilot error, weather or freak incidents such as bird strikes. The Civil Aeronautics Administration said it will not comment until an investigation into the crash is completed."

In fact, for these small islands to boast both a member of tennis' undisputed top four and the world's best golfer is something to shout about. Neither Rory McIlroy nor Andy Murray is an uncomplicated talent. McIlroy won the Dubai Desert Classic within 40 minutes of Murray's defeat in the Australian Final. The Northern Irishman's next contest will be controlled by a judge rather than an umpire. He could be in the witness box this week, when his dispute with his former management company is due to reach a Dublin courtroom. Novak Djokovic won in four sets in Melbourne That he could put that prospect out of his mind sufficiently to finish three shots clear of a top-class field in Dubai is testament to his outstanding mental resolve. In his Melbourne final, Murray did appear to suffer a mental collapse from 2-0 up in the third set, losing 12 of the next 13 games to go down 7-6, 6-7, 6-3, 6-0. There are legitimate questions about his muttering during that miserable slide to defeat. The chuntering seemed to cease when Ivan Lendl was his coach, and its reappearance is hardly a welcome sign for Murray’s fans. But losing in the final - after two shared titanic opening sets lasting a total of more than two and a half hours - was no disgrace. Murray reacts during the match Especially not against Djokovic, a man whose total of five Melbourne titles has been bettered only by the great Aussie Roy Emerson. ""Fantastic,"" said Murray in tribute. ""An incredible record, and thoroughly deserved."" Murray gave credit to his team, led by Amelie Mauresmo, the coach in whom he has placed such faith that he has ditched most of his previous support set-up. ""I will try to come back next year,"" he concluded, ""and hopefully have a slightly different outcome in the final"". In the meantime, his prospects of adding to his Wimbledon and US Open titles are brighter than most thought likely just a month ago. By then, McIlroy may - at the US Masters in Augusta in April - have become the first man to win all four of golf’s major championships while still aged 25. Stand by for another high-octane year in the two leading individual ball sports. And enjoy the fact that only this country can cheer on its natives in the top four of each."

General Sir Nicholas Carter, who took up the role of Chief of the General Staff last year, said that ethic minority representation in the military is ""nowhere near where it needs to be"". ""We have to do more. My highest priority is ensuring we continue to have the best possible talent throughout our Army,"" he said. Figures released by the Ministry of Defence reveal there are only 480 Muslims serving in Army. That is only 0.54% of the total regular force of 88,500. Moreover, not all of those Muslims are British - some joined from Commonwealth countries. Overall, all ethnic minorities - including black, Asian, Sikh, Hindu and Fijian people - make up less than 10% of the force. The military's Islamic Religious Advisor welcomed General Carter's comments. ""In my view, the values of the Armed Forces are fully compatible with the values of Islam as well as other faiths,"" said Imam Asim Hafiz. ""Anybody wishing to pursue a career in the Services, Regular or Reserve, and is prepared to work hard can be assured of a very rewarding experience."" Senior figures in the military and Ministry of Defence recognise that conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have led to negative perceptions of the military in Muslim communities. General Carter wants that to change through closer interaction and engagement with ethnic minority communities. ""Our recruitment from the black, Asian and minority ethnic communities has been improving over the years, but it is nowhere near where it needs to be,"" General Carter said. ""The values and standards we espouse resonate closely with these communities and there is much common ground that we can build on to broaden our recruitment base."" To that end, the Army has launched an Armed Forces Muslim Forum to bring military and civil communities together. It is also working to create a Muslim Peace Garden to commemorate Muslims killed in the armed forces. Labour's Shadow Defence Secretary Vernon Coaker MP, said: ""It is essential that the UK Armed Forces reflect the communities they serve, and that they are more representative of modern Britain. ""The forces must accelerate the recruitment and retention of personnel from ethnic minorities, and need to work more closely with leading community groups from across the UK to advance this."""

Paramedics have praised ""calm and mature"" Tianna Measuria for her bravery after she gave her mother's address and monitored her breathing until police officers and an ambulance arrived to help. The young girl, from Falmouth, Cornwall, was at home when she heard ""lots of noise"" from Jazmin Carter's bedroom in the early hours of the morning. As well as answering the operator's questions clearly and politely, Tianna was also heard reassuring the 24-year-old, saying: ""Don't worry mummy, don't worry, it's fine.""  During the call, Tianna reassured her mother and calmly tried to wake her Vicki Fallding, who took Tianna's call, said: ""It was like speaking to a much older child. I've spoken to adults who, in similar circumstances, are very distressed and not always able to answer all the questions. ""We were all so impressed with the level of detail she was able to provide, and would definitely encourage all parents to teach their children how to get help for them should a similar situation arise."" Miss Carter has said she is ""very lucky and very proud"" of her daughter, after the little girl remembered her stepfather's instructions of what to do in an emergency. Tianna's mother has now made a full recovery, and the South Western Ambulance Service has given the schoolgirl a certificate in recognition of her quick thinking and sound judgment.

The hotel, which has its own chapel, was the setting for Andy's brother Jamie's wedding in 2010. The 2013 Wimbledon champion bought the hotel - once the home of the Bishop of Dunblane - for £1.8m in 2013. It took a year to refurbish and was opened in the spring of last year.

One of the engines of the ATR 71-600 went idle just 37 seconds after take-off, before the aircraft dropped out of the sky, narrowly avoiding apartment buildings and leaving at least 35 people dead. Investigators believe the pilots may have switched off the other engine so they could be restarted together, but Flight 235 crashed before that could happen. According to Taiwan's Vice President, Wu Den-yih, the flight crew may have deliberately steered away from buildings to prevent further loss of life. He said: ""In his final moments, (the pilot) still wanted to control the plane to avoid harming residents in the housing communities."" When Liao Chien-tsung's body was found, he was still clutching the joystick, which officials believe is proof ""he was still trying to save the aircraft until the last minute"". His grieving mother said: ""His entire life, he did not care about himself. He is selfless."" TransAsia Airways has now confirmed that all 71 pilots of its ATR planes will be taking a flight skills test, as this is the second fatal accident for the airline in just seven months. The crash, earlier this week, was captured on a car's dashboard camera. Thomas Wang, director of the Aviation Safety Council, said: ""Based on the data we have so far we can see that for a period of time both engines showed no thrust."" Although the pilot had announced that the right engine ""flamed out"" - meaning the fuel supply was interrupted - aviation analysts believe this was not the case.  Some 58 people were on board the plane, which had taken off from Songshan airport in Taipei. Fifteen people managed to get out alive. A further eight passengers remain unaccounted for, with a team of 190 divers searching the muddy waters of the Keelung River. The full investigation into the crash is expected to take 12 months, but a preliminary report will be published within 30 days."

The 26-year-old is an aid worker from Prescott in Arizona, a small town 100 miles north of Phoenix and from a young age had a single-minded determination to help others. She was taken prisoner in Aleppo, Syria on 4 August 2013 after leaving a Spanish Doctors Without Borders hospital. Ms Mueller is thought to be Islamic State’s last remaining American hostage. Other aid workers kidnapped at the same time are thought to have been released, but according to a CBS report last year, IS was demanding a $6.6m (£4.3m) ransom to set her free. Kayla Mueller worked in a refugee camp. Pic: Matt Hinshaw/The Daily Courier Ms Mueller had been helping Syrian refugees on the Turkish border since December 2012, working with aid agencies including Support to Life and the Danish Refugee Council. In 2013, she described the desperate situation in a refugee camp, including how she helped reunite a six-year-old with his relative after the camp was bombed. ""For as long as I live, I will not let this suffering be normal,"" she told Prescott’s Daily Courier. ""(I will not let this be) something we just accept."" ""This story is not rare in Syria,"" she added. ""This is the reality for Syrians two and a half years on. ""When Syrians hear I'm an American, they ask, 'Where is the world?' All I can do is cry with them, because I don't know."" Ms Mueller had also campaigned on behalf of genocide victims and volunteered for three years with the Save Darfur Coalition in her late teens. A 2007 interview for the Daily Courier describes how she called and wrote to members of the US Congress, and took part in silent walks to raise awareness. Kayla Mueller with her mother, Marsha ""I love cultures and language and learning about people's cultures,"" she told the paper as she prepared to start university in Flagstaff. After graduating in 2009, she spent around a year living and working with humanitarian aid groups in northern India, Israel and Palestine. Heading back to Arizona in 2011, she worked at an AIDS clinic and volunteered at a women's shelter at night. The US government and Ms Mueller’s family had kept her name secret until IS claimed she had been killed, fearing any publicity would put her in more danger. Her parents, Carl and Marsha Mueller, said in a statement on Friday: ""Kayla found this (aid) work heart-breaking but compelling; she is extremely devoted to the people of Syria. ""When asked what kept her going in her mission, she said, 'I find God in the suffering eyes reflected in mine, if this is how you are revealed to me, this is how I will forever seek you.'"" If her death is confirmed she would be the fourth American to die while being held by IS. The others, journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, and aid worker Peter Kassig were beheaded by the group."

The initiatives will be unveiled at a conference in London today to mark International Day of Zero Tolerance for FGM. The Government will also announce an additional £3.6m in funding to tackle the potentially lethal practice, which is believed to affect as many as 137,000 women in the UK. Public Health Minister Jane Ellison said: ""FGM devastates the lives of women and girls and we are committed to ending this brutal practice in one generation. ""I am immensely proud of this Government's legacy and continued work to end FGM."" The measures are aimed at putting prevention at the centre of efforts to eliminate FGM following accusations that too much emphasis has been placed on prosecution.  The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has updated its guidelines for nurses and midwives on FGM amid claims medics fear treating the condition. It has also demanded the Government ""ensure healthcare staff have comprehensive training and support to help tackle the abuse"".

Police were called to Atlanta's W Hotel early on Friday after one of the R&B singer's relatives smashed her son over the head with a glass bottle.  Shayne Brown said his mother, Tina Brown, spat on him before striking him with the bottle during an argument about a valet parking ticket, a police report said. The fight happened at a party to celebrate Bobby Brown's 46th birthday on Thursday - five days after Bobbi Kristina was found unresponsive face down in a bath tub.  Bobbi Kristina's family denies she has been taken off life support In the call, a witness said eight to 10 people were fighting at the hotel bar.  He told police one person had ""used one of the glasses at the bar as a weapon"". ""They hit somebody and cut them in the face,"" he said. Police did not say how the pair are related to the singer. Shayne Brown suffered cuts and drove himself to the hospital, while Tina Brown left the hotel before police arrived. Hopes are said to be fading for the 21-year-old No charges have been filed. Meanwhile Bobbi Kristina Brown's family have denied reports the 21-year-old daughter of Whitney Houston is brain dead or has been taken off life support. However her cousin has said ""doctors see no hope"".  Posting on Instagram as yfkennedy, Jerod Brown wrote: ""Though it seems the odds are against her, though doctors don't see any hope for change… though it looks impossible for her to stand again STILL PRAY FOR BK."" Houston, a six-time Grammy Award winner and actress who battled substance abuse, died in February 2012 after she, like her daughter, was found unresponsive in a bathtub. Authorities found a dozen prescription drug bottles in the 48-year-old's Beverly Hills Hotel suite and concluded that she accidentally drowned, although heart disease and cocaine use were listed as contributing factors."

A report by the Commons Defence Select Committee also found the UK is contributing less than its NATO partners and that the British military lacks a strategy for defeating IS, also known as ISIS. The report comes after the father of a Jordanian pilot murdered by IS denounced the group as ""wild beasts"". The committee's chairman, Rory Stewart, said: ""The UK should be focused much more on Iraq. It should be a higher priority. Defence Committee chairman Rory Stewart urges a focus on Iraq ""That doesn't mean combat troops on the ground. That means, to begin with, just understanding what is going on. ""That means putting military and civilian personnel on to the ground to start mapping who is the enemy, who are these people in ISIS or Da'ash? ""Who are our allies? How do we work with the Sunni tribes? How do we work with the neighbours? What is the US campaign plan? What is the Iraqi campaign plan? ""Once we answer those questions, and we need to answer them urgently, we're not going to begin to play a constructive role fighting ISIS."" Britain only has three military personnel stationed outside northern, Kurdish Iraq. They have not yet made any specific pledges to send more. That number compares to 3,000 Americans, 300 Spanish personnel and 280 Italians. Britain has so far contributed 40 heavy machine guns, but Germany is offering a vast arsenal of weapons, including 16,000 assault rifles, 10,000 hand grenades and 8,000 pistols. RAF aircraft, confined to bombing Iraq and not Syria, have only contributed to 6% of the total strikes against Islamic State positions. General Sir Richard Shirreff, former deputy supreme commander of NATO forces, is unimpressed with the UK effort, considering it is one of the P5 - permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. He said: ""What we need to see from our political leaders is leadership and a preparedness to say, 'This isn't going to be easy, this isn't going to go away, this does affect us dramatically and domestically and internationally'.

Jordan McDonald concocted an ""unbelievable web of lies"" after he and three others held up a wages delivery driver and stole £23,000. When officers searched a Toyota Corolla abandoned shortly after the Birmingham crime, they found shopping vouchers bearing the 23-year-old's name. They then found a large amount of cash at his girlfriend's home – and a picture on his mobile phone showed the sequential banknotes laid out on the stairs. He tried to convince West Midlands Police that the £5,800 – his share from the robbery – was from the sale of a car, and McDonald even produced a receipt to corroborate of his story. Following a trial at Birmingham Crown Court, he has been sentenced to eight years behind bars, but his accomplices are still wanted by police. ""McDonald will now have several years behind bars to contemplate the error of his ways,"" said Detective Constable Michelle Hunt."

In a statement released by a family representative, Ms Mueller's parents Marsha and Carl Mueller made a personal appeal to IS.     ""You told us that you treated Kayla as your guest, as your guest her safety and well-being remains your responsibility,"" they said, addressing ""those in positions of responsibility for holding Kayla"". Ms Mueller disappeared in August 2013. Pic: The Daily Courier The statement asked IS to contact the family privately. According to the Site Intelligence Group which monitors extremists, IS said the 26-year-old aid worker died on Friday after Jordanian warplanes struck the building where she was being held. The terrorist group said no IS fighters died in the raids in their de facto capital of Raqqa, Syria. It released images showing a damaged building it said had been targeted in airstrikes, but no photos to back their claims Ms Mueller had been killed. The White House, State Department and Pentagon have said they can't confirm the unsubstantiated report. ""We are obviously deeply concerned by these reports,"" said Bernadette Meehan, spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council, in a statement. ""We have not at this time seen any evidence that corroborates ISIL's claim."" Jordan has also dismissed the IS claim as ""criminal propaganda"", but said its jets did carry out a second consecutive day of strikes on IS sites on Friday. It has stepped up its operations against IS since the militants burned to death a captured Jordanian pilot. Ms Mueller, of Prescott, Arizona, disappeared in August 2013 in the northern Syrian city of Aleppo. A media blackout on her abduction was broken by President Barack Obama on Sunday, when he confirmed IS still had at least one US hostage. He said the US was ""deploying all the assets that we can"" to find Ms Mueller. Her name had not been made public due to fears for her safety. The group has already executed three American hostages: James Foley, Peter Kassig and Steven Sotloff. Two British hostages, David Haines and Alan Henning, and two Japanese hostages, Kenjo Goto and Haruna Yukawa, have also been killed. British reporter John Cantlie is still being held captive."
2015-02-07,A British jihadi who posed with the severed heads of Syrian soldiers and faked his own death to sneak back into the UK has been jailed for 12 years.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150207063407/http://news.sky.com/story/1422629/jihadi-who-faked-death-gets-12-years-in-jail,"By Mark White, Home Affairs Correspondent A British jihadi who posed with the severed heads of Syrian soldiers and faked his own death to sneak back into the UK has been jailed for 12 years. But Imran Khawaja - who spent six months in Syria alongside insurgents linked to terror group Islamic State - has appealed to other young British Muslims not to make the same mistakes he did. He acted as a frontman for Rayat Al Tawheed, posting dozens of photos and videos online and boasting of his weapons training and exploits on the battlefield. He also encouraged other young men and women to become jihadis and travel to the region. During a two-day sentencing hearing at Woolwich Crown Court in south east London, Khawaja's defence team appealed to the judge, Mr Justice Baker for leniency, claiming the 27-year-old was a ""psychologically vulnerable"" young man who bitterly regretted his actions. But prosecutor Brian Altman QC said Khawaja had featured in some disturbing footage of decapitated Syrian government soldiers. In one video sequence, played before a hushed court, Mr Altman said Khawaja could be seen picking up severed heads from the back of a flatbed truck and saying: ""Heads. Kuffar (non-Muslims) Disgusting."" Mr Altman said: ""His attitude is quite clearly contemptuous. There is no sign of compulsion or revulsion."" At a court hearing last month, the former security guard pleaded guilty to preparing acts of terrorism, attending a terror training camp in Syria and receiving weapons training. He was sentenced today alongside two other men, his cousin Tahir Bhatti, who pleaded guilty to assisting an offender and his friend Asim Ali, who admitted terrorism funding. Bhatti, a taxi driver, was persuaded to travel to Bulgaria last June to pick up Khawaja and help smuggle him back into the UK. He was sentenced to 21 months for assisting an offender. Gallery: British Jihadi Imran Khawaja Jailed Imran Khawaja, a British jihadi nicknamed ""Barbie"" who fled a Syrian training camp because he had ""had enough"" of conditions there, has been handed a 12 year sentence. Pictures courtesy of ICSR, King's College London Ali was given a 21-month sentence for withdrawing £300 to give to his friend on 24 January last year, two days before Khawaja left for Syria. Throughout his almost six months in the Middle East, Khawaja's family never alerted the UK authorities. Instead they embarked on a relentless campaign of text and social media messaging, desperately pleading with him to return home. In one exchange, his sister Azmeena berated her brother for deserting the family, saying he had broken his parents' hearts. In another message, she said: ""Book your ticket and come home or I will come and get you."" He told his sister he would not be returning and wanted to ""die a martyr"". At the beginning of June last year, Rayat al Tawheed posted an Instagram message stating Khawaja, known by his social media name Abu Daigham al Britaini, had died in battle. But that post was a deception, Khawaja was already on his way back to the UK in a car driven by his cousin. The pair were stopped and arrested at the port of Dover on 3 June. In a letter to the judge read out in court, Khawaja said: ""I am sincerely sorry. I have let my country, my family and my community down. ""I have nightmares about Syria. I am lucky to be alive. I would hate to see the young men of Britain make the same mistake I made and say to them 'do not get attracted by the propaganda'."" But prosecutors said they had seen no sign that Khawaja was truly repentant for his crimes. He was, authorities believe, only returning to the UK to raise more funds, before heading back out to Syria and Iraq."
2015-02-07,"Perhaps the most damning line in a report full of damnation was simply this: ""Rotherham does not learn, even in the most tragic circumstances.""",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150207063407/http://news.sky.com/story/1421571/damning-report-for-council-in-denial,"Perhaps the most damning line in a report full of damnation was simply this: ""Rotherham does not learn, even in the most tragic circumstances."" The mass cabinet resignation reflects the pure inability of the leadership to deal with the problem of child sexual exploitation (CSE) in Rotherham, or even face up to it. It was a council ""in denial,"" report author Louise Casey concluded. Despite three high profile resignations back in August last year following an investigation by Alexis Jay, 70% of remaining councillors hadn't accepted the findings of the Jay report which found 1,400 children had been sexually exploited, mostly by Asian gangs. Louise Casey's report was scathing about Rotherham Council and police Louise Casey states: ""When Professor Jay brought forward the undeniable and cohesive facts of CSE in Rotherham, her report was met with denial and challenge."" Casey says Jay's 1,400 figure was a ""conservative estimate"" and found that despite the denials the council was unable to produce its own figures. Gallery: Who's Who in The Rotherham Abuse Scandal Roger Stone - Leader of Rotherham Borough Council from 2003 to 2014. Resigned when the report was published in August last year. The head of the Government's Troubled Families Unit also raised concerns about the honesty of officials. In a remarkable revelation she states that some councillors did not pay their council tax bills until receiving orders from the magistrates' court. Casey also highlighted a case of ""missing laptops"" that held large amounts of data on children. The report claims the council ""did cover up the scale of the loss known at the time"". And so, at a time when central government is trying to avoid intervention in local politics, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said it was ""with a heavy heart"" that he had to remove a ""wholly dysfunctional cabinet"". There will be new elections in 2016 but until then, five commissioners will take over a number of key duties, which include looking after children's and young people's services and adult social care, as well as taxi licensing. But this is just the first step in combating an institution found to be ""not fit for purpose"" with a culture of ""bullying, sexism, suppression and misplaced political correctness"". During a Sky News investigation broadcast last week, we found outreach services that tried to highlight the problem had been ignored despite reporting hundreds of child grooming cases to different authorities within the council. Casey's report concurs that: ""Many of those raising the problem of CSE with the council did not do so quietly. There were reports to senior staff, to members, to scrutiny committees, to safeguarding boards. ""There were externally commissioned reports about CSE that were not acted upon."" This can't all be blamed on the leadership. Rotherham also needs services that are fit for purpose - and the purpose is huge and complex, requiring a great deal of expertise. Louise Casey laments the closure of the ""groundbreaking"" youth project Risky Business, which it described as ""critical to the success of Operation Central"" that led to the conviction of five men for offences including rape and other sexual offences with children. This project gained the trust of victims and understood the complexities of child grooming. Yet, Sky News found that a new outreach project proposed by the former manager of Risky Business was recently denied funding by the council. The Casey report states that ""Street grooming is insidious and needs a more nuanced approach to get girls to understand what is happening to them and to tell their story. ""This is where outreach workers have a vital role to play but an effective outreach programme is not in place."" To achieve this, the new commissioners will need a great deal of cash behind them and the Department for Communities and Local Government has yet to make clear the levels of investment that it is prepared to make. What's more, there is a whole other issue to be addressed, covered in the Casey report under the title ""Where were the Police?"" If you are looking for more shocking lines in this report go no further. One story is of a victim's paperwork being ripped up by a police officer as she is told ""Nothing good will come of it"". Another officer allegedly told a victim: ""Don’t worry - you aren't the first girl to be raped by XX and you won't be the last."" The report finds victims were threatened with wasting police time, told they had consented to sex and, on occasion, were arrested at the scene of a crime, rather than the perpetrators. The Independent Police Complaints Commission is currently investigating 10 officers and the National Crime Agency is considering which abuse cases it will take over from South Yorkshire Police, and confirmed it is making investigations into potential criminality within the council reported to them by Louise Casey. It is clear that Rotherham has a huge task ahead but as the Casey report states: ""It is not at all clear that Rotherham has identified who and where the victims are, what their current needs are, and what services they may require in the future."""
2015-02-07,Police are searching for two men after female army cadets reported they were threatened with beheading outside an Army Reserve centre.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150207063407/http://news.sky.com/story/1422861/police-hunt-pair-over-cadet-beheading-threat,"Police are searching for two men after female army cadets reported they were threatened with beheading outside an Army Reserve centre. Officers have released a photograph of the men in a silver Opel Zafira outside the centre in Gateshead. The occupants of the car are thought to have asked the two teenagers ""Are you in the Army?"", before shouting threats as they drove past in Alexandra Road. The alleged reference to beheading has chilling echoes of the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby who was attacked in Woolwich, London, in May 2013. Northumbria Police have stepped up patrols in the area, following the threats at 9.15pm on Wednesday, 21 January. They have also warned other Army Reserve centres - formerly the Territorial Army - to be on their guard. Police have traced the car, which is left-hand drive and appears to have foreign plates. Lee Rigby was murdered near an Army barracks in Woolwich The driver is described as black or Asian, in his 40s, and of plump or muscular build with a black bushy beard and wearing dark clothes. The passenger is also said to be black or Asian, in his 30s, and had short black hair and stubble. Gateshead Superintendent Richie Jackson said: ""The men made no attempt to make any physical contact with the girls or get out of the car, and shouted the comments while driving away from the scene. ""Enquiries are ongoing to establish the exact nature of what was said during the incident and we have spoken to the two teenage girls, viewed CCTV footage from the area and have identified the vehicle and inquiries are ongoing to trace the driver. ""As a precaution we have notified staff at other Army Reserve centres in the area and have had extra officers on patrol in Alexandra Road to reassure residents. Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale were jailed for Lee Rigby's murder ""Although this is concerning, it is an isolated incident and if anyone has any information that could help us with the investigation I'd ask that they contact us on 101."" A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ""We are aware of an incident allegedly involving members of the Army Cadet Force - this is a matter for the police and we cannot comment further. ""Any witnesses are urged to contact the police. ""We understand the girls were not in uniform at the time of the incident."" Fusilier Rigby was killed near the Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich, while off duty. Killers Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale set about him with knives and a cleaver, hacking him to death. The pair were found guilty of murder and sentenced to life in jail."

Sky News can reveal that Mr Oliver, the self-styled Naked Chef, has drafted in investment bankers to offload a chunk of his media and publishing business. The appointment of Raine, a New York-based merchant bank, is expected to lead to Jamie Oliver Group raising up to £50m from the sale of a minority interest in the unit. Bidders are expected to include private equity firms, media groups and wealthy individuals from around the world, with a formal auction likely to underline the chef's continuing international appeal. In a statement issued to Sky News, a spokesman for Jamie Oliver Group said: ""Like any well run private company, we regularly review our funding policy and requirements. ""All options, including bringing on board an external investor, are considered in order to position the group to take best advantage of the clear market opportunities that lie ahead."" Insiders said that Raine's work would not include Mr Oliver's fast-growing restaurant business, which includes the Jamie's Italian chain of outlets across the UK. His media interests have also seen rapid expansion, although they endured a blip in 2013, according to accounts filed at Companies House. Pre-tax profit at the parent company Jamie Oliver Holdings, which houses his publishing interests and his TV production company Fresh One Productions, fell to £6.2m from £9.8m in 2012 after exceptional items. Turnover was 7.1% lower than the year before at £32.8m, according to the accounts. Figures for 2014 are not yet publicly available. Mr Oliver is worth £240m, according to last year's Sunday Times Rich List, and the sale of a stake in his media business is expected to fuel further international expansion. The chef has created an online video venture called FoodTube, which now has more than 1m subscribers. A former face of J Sainsbury's advertising campaigns, he has also worked to improve standards of school food and now employs more than 8000 people across his various businesses."

According to some Sasquatch enthusiasts, footage shot at Yellowstone National Park shows not one but four of the mythological creatures. The footage shows bison roaming around in a snow-covered park - until four creatures walking upright appear in the background. The footage posted by user Mary Greeley has been watched some 40,000 times since the end of December. Bigfoot print? This image was taken near Mount Everest 13 December 1951 ""News they don't want you to hear"", says a caption as the clip starts. The video, captured on camera near the tourist attraction's Old Faithful geyser, cuts away before the camera can take a closer look at the creatures. Bigfoot is said to have flat feet - similar to a human's - and a footprint that spans over 40cm. Enthusiasts have long hoped to find evidence proving the existence of a creature widely thought to be fictional. Scientists believe that most supposed sightings are cases of misidentification of other animals or hoaxes. Yellowstone National Park Spokesperson Al Nash told ABC: ""Bigfoot sightings are not frequent, but it happens. ""People say a lot of crazy things about Yellowstone all the time and bigfoot is just one of them."" Despite its controversial status, the beast is a very popular cultural symbol in North America, and  was used as one of the mascots for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Canada."

More than 40 venues in the city have signed up to a new police-backed scheme which is aimed at cutting drink-related violence. It means heavy drinkers could be ""tested and turned away"" from bars and clubs in the city centre. Sergeant Dave Francis from Central Birmingham Police says it is to stop people from turning up at a venue already drunk. He said: ""People who 'pre-load'... are more likely to get into trouble. ""It creates a vicious circle because if venues aren't making money they may be tempted to put on drinks promotions that lead to more drunkenness."" The special ""Alco-Blow"" tubes differ from traditional police breathalysers. Clubbers blow on to the device from a few inches away. It can then alert door staff if a person registers at a level that is twice the legal drink-drive limit. Sgt Francis said: ""These are a tool for the bars to be able to say if they want someone or not on their premises, they can determine if someone has got a lot of alcohol in their system and then they can decide if they want someone to come into their place or not."" It will be at the venue's discretion to decide who should and should not be allowed in. But police believe it should be an effective tool in reducing the amount of drunken brawls and alcohol-related crimes."

However, the family denied reports that the 21-year-old, the daughter of Whitney Houston, had been taken off life support. Posting on Instagram as yfkennedy, Jerod Brown wrote: ""Though it seems the odds are against her, though doctors don't see any hope for change… though it looks impossible for her to stand again STILL PRAY FOR BK."" Bobbi Kristina Brown was found at her suburban townhouse in Georgia Few details about the young woman's condition have been released. Her family said she was fighting for her life after she was found face down in the bathtub of her suburban Atlanta townhouse and rushed to hospital on Saturday. Family friend and gospel singer Kim Burrell told Access Hollywood this week that doctors had put the young woman in a medically induced coma to stop brain swelling. However, claims that she had been pulled off life support or declared brain dead were denied by a family source, Reuters reported. Her father Bobby Brown said in a statement: ""If we issued a statement every time the media published a false report regarding this matter, that's all we would be doing 24 hours a day.

Meanwhile, police were called to Atlanta's W Hotel early on Friday after two of Bobby Brown's relatives had a fight. Shayne Brown said his mother, Tina Brown, spat on him and struck his head with a glass bottle during an argument about a valet parking ticket, a police report said. The fight happened at a party to celebrate Bobby Brown's 46th birthday on Thursday, Shayne Brown told police. Houston, a six-time Grammy Award winner and actress who battled substance abuse, was found unresponsive in a bathtub on 11 February 2012. Authorities found a dozen prescription drug bottles in the 48-year-old's Beverly Hills Hotel suite and concluded that she accidentally drowned, although heart disease and cocaine use were listed as contributing factors."

In fact, for these small islands to boast both a member of tennis' undisputed top four and the world's best golfer is something to shout about. Neither Rory McIlroy nor Andy Murray is an uncomplicated talent. McIlroy won the Dubai Desert Classic within 40 minutes of Murray's defeat in the Australian Final. The Northern Irishman's next contest will be controlled by a judge rather than an umpire. He could be in the witness box this week, when his dispute with his former management company is due to reach a Dublin courtroom. Novak Djokovic won in four sets in Melbourne That he could put that prospect out of his mind sufficiently to finish three shots clear of a top-class field in Dubai is testament to his outstanding mental resolve. In his Melbourne final, Murray did appear to suffer a mental collapse from 2-0 up in the third set, losing 12 of the next 13 games to go down 7-6, 6-7, 6-3, 6-0. There are legitimate questions about his muttering during that miserable slide to defeat. The chuntering seemed to cease when Ivan Lendl was his coach, and its reappearance is hardly a welcome sign for Murray’s fans. But losing in the final - after two shared titanic opening sets lasting a total of more than two and a half hours - was no disgrace. Murray reacts during the match Especially not against Djokovic, a man whose total of five Melbourne titles has been bettered only by the great Aussie Roy Emerson. ""Fantastic,"" said Murray in tribute. ""An incredible record, and thoroughly deserved."" Murray gave credit to his team, led by Amelie Mauresmo, the coach in whom he has placed such faith that he has ditched most of his previous support set-up. ""I will try to come back next year,"" he concluded, ""and hopefully have a slightly different outcome in the final"". In the meantime, his prospects of adding to his Wimbledon and US Open titles are brighter than most thought likely just a month ago. By then, McIlroy may - at the US Masters in Augusta in April - have become the first man to win all four of golf’s major championships while still aged 25. Stand by for another high-octane year in the two leading individual ball sports. And enjoy the fact that only this country can cheer on its natives in the top four of each."

David Cameron seems to agree. This week after Flight Lieutenant Moaz Kasasbeh was burned alive by the death cult, the Prime Minister told MPs: ""I'm sure the whole house will join me in condemning the sickening murders in Syria of Japanese journalist Kenji Goto and the Jordanian pilot Lieutenant Moaz al-Kasasbeh. ""I'm sure the thoughts and prayers of the whole House will be with their families at this very difficult time ... I can assure the House that we will not stop until the murderous ISIL extremists behind this, and their poisonous ideology, are eradicated."" But, with a handful of drones, bombers and men, Britain's contribution to the coalition is almost negligible. Could this be because the government isn't committed to eradicating the mass murderers? Maybe. So far the UK's efforts have been at a very tactical level. This may be because it's not really committed to wider fight. But it may be a function of something much more banal. Money. Number 10 has come up with a tactical solution to a domestic political problem. The government needs to be seen to be doing something. It doesn't want to have to pay too much for it. It doesn't want to get sucked into another war in the Islamic world. So it does a bit - satisfying (it hopes) those in Britain who demand some kind of action. This looks like a tactical domestic expedient not an international strategy. Consider Libya. It's closer to the UK. It's one of the major bases for illegal immigrants to Europe, it's a failing state and an arsenal for global militancy, it's oil rich and it's largely the fault of the UK and France that it's in the mess it is today. Paris and London led the charge to get rid of Muammar Gaddafi. He was a tactical problem. The strategy for what should come next and how to deliver it evaporated. Now British officials insist that Libya does not pose a threat to Europe. One senior Whitehall source insisted that, as Libya ""doesn’t pose a clear and present danger"", there would be no point in advising greater involvement there by the UK ""because no money would come"". Gallery: Living Under Sniper Fire In Syria Children play near a bus barricading a street, which serves as protection from snipers loyal to Syrian President Bashar al Assad, in Aleppo's rebel-controlled Bustan al-Qasr neighbourhood So the UK is allowed to swerve around the Libyan problem by defining it as a tactical, not a strategic, problem. In Syria and Iraq, the UK and the rest of the US coalition partners are applying a similar logic. They are using a tactic - air strikes - to solve a strategic problem that requires air, sea and ground forces on a bigger scale than the allies deployed against Saddam Hussein 12 years ago. Or, the allies (especially those in the West) don't see IS as anything more than a tactical threat. This may be the truth. But it doesn't explain the half-cocked war being waged against the cult which will achieve neither tactical not strategic success."

The widower was left with a shoulder injury but did not need hospital treatment, but police say he has been left ""living in fear of his safety"". Detective Sergeant Gemma Alger of the Westminster Serious Crime Unit said: ""This is a totally unprovoked, callous and sickening assault on a defenceless pensioner. ""The victim is fiercely independent and has lived in London all his life. His confidence has been eroded as a result of the actions of this individual and now he is fearful about going out. ""I would urge anyone who has any information on who was responsible to contact us as soon as possible before he targets someone else."" The suspect is described as a black man, between 5ft 10ins and 6ft, slim and aged 20-30. He was wearing casual dark clothing."

It was filmed to launch the UK's first Children's Mental Health Week run by one of the charities Kate supports, Place2Be, which offers counselling and support in schools. In the video she says: ""We need to help young people and their parents to understand it's not a sign of weakness to ask for help. ""A child's mental health is just as important as their physical health and deserves the same quality of support. ""No one would feel embarrassed about seeking help for a child if they broke their arm, and we really should be equally ready to support a child coping with emotional difficulties."" The Duchess of Cambridge is a patron of the charity Place2Be She adds: ""Both William and I sincerely believe that early action can prevent problems in childhood from turning into larger ones later in life."" Research carried out by Place2Be and YouGov found almost a third (30%) of parents admit they would feel embarrassed if their child wanted counselling in school. One in five parents would not encourage their child to take up counselling, even if they asked for it. The research showed it is fathers who are more likely to feel embarrassed. Catherine Roche, the chief executive officer of Place2Be, said: ""By raising awareness of the benefits of getting support early for mental health issues, we hope to change attitudes and help reduce the risk of more complex and serious problems when those children reach adulthood. The Duchess encouraged parents to be more open about mental health ""We'd encourage all parents and carers to take a look at the ideas and tips on our website about how to talk to children about their mental health today."" While the Duchess is soon to be a mother-of-two, with her second child due in April, a big focus of her charity work is helping children affected by addiction, neglect and other issues related to trauma. A spokesman for Kensington Palace said: ""As Royal patron of Place2Be The Duchess of Cambridge is a committed champion of issues related to children's mental health and emotional wellbeing. ""The Duchess of Cambridge is especially concerned with early intervention mental health support for young people, to tackle these issues at the earliest possible stage, so that children have the brightest possible futures, as they deserve."""

The suspect was detained at a property in Newham, east London on Saturday morning by officers from Scotland Yard's Counter Terrorism Command. He was taken into custody at a south London police station and questioned before being released pending further enquiries to a date in mid-March. Police said he was suspected of collecting information which may be useful to someone who commits or prepares acts of terrorism and of encouraging acts of terrorism. Islamic State, which is staging a conflict in Iraq and Syria where it wants to create an Islamic caliphate, was named as a banned organisation in the UK in June last year. The group has released a number of videos showing the murders of Western hostages, including British aid workers Alan Henning, 47, and David Haines, 44."

Oisin McGrath's parents, Nigel and Sharon, and his sisters, Caireen and Ciana, were joined by hundreds of people at the church in Belcoo. His classmates and Gaelic football teammates formed a guard of honour outside and a school choir sang as his coffin arrived. Those inside the church heard how the teenager's organs had been donated to five patients thanks to a decision by his ""selfless"" parents. The County Fermanagh village has been stunned by the playground tragedy, which is still being investigated by police. A 17-year-old sixth form student from the same Enniskillen school was questioned after the incident but has been released on bail, pending enquiries. The year nine student was taken to hospital from St Michael's College at lunchtime on Monday and died on Thursday evening. On medical advice, his parents made the agonising decision to withdraw their teenage son's life support and donate his organs for transplant. Father Seamus Quinn paid tribute to the schoolboy, a budding musician and sportsman, and said the grief of his school friends spoke volumes. He said: ""He was forever smiling, a big wide happy grin etched on his face. ""He was a natural, unaffected young lad, quiet and easy to be with, the kind of smile that drew the best out of you, whether you were young or old. ""Because of his parents' incredibly selfless and faith-based decision, Oisin's falling on the ground and dying like a grain of wheat has brought life to five other human beings."""

One suffered facial injuries and a second hurt his hip as they tried to rouse the driver, who had collapsed. The pair shouted to him that he was killing people and shook him. However, their efforts were hampered by a metal rail inside the cab between the driver and other crew, who sit on a raised bench in the rear. It presented an obstacle and both men sustained their injuries as they were jostled by the erratic movement of the vehicle. Gallery: Victims Of Glasgow Bin Lorry Crash Jacqueline Morton, 51, who had left work early to collect her granddaughters A succession of collisions meant that the driver’s weight shifted on the steering wheel which, in turn, caused sudden changes in the lorry’s course. There was an air-brake in the cab which slowly reduces speed but neither of the two crew was trained in how to drive the bin lorry and so neither knew how to bring it to a halt. The vehicle only came to rest after crashing into the Millennium Hotel in Glasgow's George Square. The two crew members, whom Sky News has chosen not to name, first realised something was wrong after they had stopped to make the penultimate pick-up of their round outside the Primark store in Glasgow's Queen Street. Gallery: Images From The Scene In Glasgow After The Bin Lorry Crash The lorry crashed into the Millennium Hotel at the top of Queen Street in the city centre As the vehicle set off again, it swerved inexplicably and then proceeded on its fatal journey, around 400 metres towards the city's George Square. The driver has been named as 58 year-old Harry Clarke. Following the incident, a blood sample was taken from him and he tested negative for drink-driving. He has since reportedly said he was diagnosed with a heart condition following the crash on 22 December last year.  Examination of on-board monitoring equipment showed that it travelled at just over 20 mph as the tragedy unfolded. The lorry would have travelled for roughly 40 seconds. The bin lorry driver was routinely required to record his own driving hours. Whether or not he followed procedure on the day of the crash will be examined by Scotland's Crown Office, along with all the other circumstances of the incident. It is currently considering a police report on the incident. The Crown Office will also decide whether or not a Fatal Accident Inquiry (FAI) will take place into  the crash. The GMB Union, which represents the two crew members on board the refuse truck, has told Sky News it would welcome an FAI. Cal Waterson, Regional Organiser of GMB Scotland, said: """"I wouldn’t like to speculate at the moment because we’re still waiting for the police report to be published but, obviously, there was pressure being put on the accelerator. ""How would the crew have been expected to prevent that? ""That’s something that I hope a Fatal Accident Inquiry would look into and be able to come up with some recommendations whereby we can put in some overriding device in the rear of the cab or something similar."""
2015-02-16,"HSBC has taken out adverts in national newspapers offering ""sincerest apologies"" over past activities at its Swiss operations.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150216132154/http://news.sky.com/story/1427764/hsbc-issues-apology-over-banking-standards,"HSBC has taken out adverts in national newspapers offering ""sincerest apologies"" over past activities at its Swiss operations. In the open letter to its customers, shareholders and colleagues, HSBC's group chief executive Stuart Gulliver described recent media coverage about practices at the Swiss Private Bank eight years ago as a ""painful experience"". However, the Business Secretary has said he wants greater assurances about tax transparency. Vince Cable told Sky's Murnaghan programme that what emerged is ""striking and unacceptable"" - and he has called on former HSBC boss Lord Green to answer specific allegations about the business. The full-page HSBC advert states: ""We would like to provide some reassurance and state some of the facts that lie behind the stories. The advert was published in the Mail On Sunday and The Sun On Sunday ""The media focus has been on historical events that show the standards to which we operate today were not universally in place in our Swiss operations eight years ago. ""We must show we understand that the societies we serve expect more from us. We therefore offer our sincerest apologies."" The bank added that since 2008 it had established a ""much tighter central control around who are our customers"". It said it had also implemented tougher standards around tax transparency. Earlier this week Mr Gulliver sent a memo to the bank's staff saying the revelations were painful and frustrating. The adverts come amid a political row over tax avoidance, with Labour leader Ed Miliband on Saturday vowing to carry out an inquiry into the UK's tax authority should his party win power in the next General Election. Mr Miliband argued that people not paying their fair share of tax had left ""a £34bn hole in the nation's finances"". Promising an ""aggressive"" review into Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) if his party wins in May, Mr Miliband pointed to suspicions of ""sweetheart deals"" with wealthy firms. And the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, has told Sky News a ""crackdown"" is needed because there had only been one prosecution out of more than a thousand cases of tax avoidance at HSBC's private Swiss arm. ""Was that because the Conservatives were back-peddling, brushing it under the carpet? Was it because the HSBC boss had now become a minister? Was it because their donors were involved in that HSBC activity? I think we need answers from David Cameron and George Osborne, and we need them soon,"" he added. This week, Mr Miliband seized on allegations about tax avoidance by HSBC clients to brand Prime Minister David Cameron a ""dodgy Prime Minister, surrounded by dodgy donors"". Speaking on Sky News, Mr Cable said: ""I think the worst period we went through was 10 years ago, when all the leading banks were offering industrial-scale tax avoidance to British citizens to avoid British tax - and they were doing it out of London. ""There are still things happening that should definitely not be happening."" After a week of clashes between Mr Miliband and Mr Cameron, the former Tory chancellor Ken Clarke said there needs to be agreement on a ""more sensible and defensible"" system for funding political parties. Mr Clarke told The Observer newspaper that the Conservatives should break their reliance on wealthy donors and embrace the need for more state funding of politics."

The biggest overspend was at the Ministry of Defence (MoD), where £6m was spent on ear plugs found to be not fit for purpose. The MoD also spent £7.2m on mobile mine-detection capability for Warrior vehicles that was deemed unsuitable and wasted £4m by the early withdrawal from service of Sea King helicopters, the report says. It also highlights a £1.2m loss in the Department for Education because of a payment by a school into the wrong bank account. The Home Office also spent more than £1.7m on flights that were cancelled without the possibility of a refund, and the Department for Work and Pensions wasted more than £420m in overpayments on benefits. Andy Silvester, campaign director at the TPA, told Sky News: ""People will be angry that this is money that could have been spent on schools, on hospitals, on the essential services we constantly hear are under threat because of the size of the deficit we are running. ""Ultimately, we've got an election coming up and all the parties are promising to balance the books."" Making Whitehall more efficient has to be part of that drive, he said. Mr Silvester admitted that not all the costs were unnecessary or wasteful. The money includes £50m spent on funerals for the poorest families and £12m on vaccines that are out of date. But the TPA still thinks these costs could be budgeted for, or reduced with better planning. Louise Cooper, a financial analyst, added that it was a problem that no party had fully grappled with - and said partnerships with the private sector had not provided the solution. A Government spokesperson said: ""Like any business, government departments will always have write-downs for things like unused stock, and as the report recognises, some of these figures are outside the control of the public sector. ""However, this government has clamped down on wasteful spending and last year saved £14.3bn for the taxpayer."""

Scientists found such potent forms of the drug increased the likelihood that a user would develop the condition. Casual users of the stronger variants of the class B substance have been found to be three times more likely to develop psychosis, while heavy users are five times more likely. The findings of the six-year study - which have been published in the Lancet Psychiatry journal - suggest strong forms of cannabis can lead to serious mental illness. Sarah Graham, a drugs counsellor, has claimed the figure is ""just the tip of the iceberg"". A recovering addict herself, she described ""skunk"" as the ""Incredible Hulk of cannabis"", and warned: ""It is absolutely decimating young people's lives."" She told Sky News: ""It's not the weed that many parents may have experimented with at university or college. This is a very, very potent drug. It’s like a turbo-charged version of ordinary cannabis - and it's laced with chemicals, too. ""I see so many young people who are having their mental health decimated by this drug. I see them in hospitals, in psychiatric wards and it is absolutely heart-breaking. I see them being diagnosed with forms of schizophrenia. We need to start taking this seriously.""  Researchers from King's College London say there should be greater public awareness of the effects of using the stronger form of the drug. Sir Robin Murray, professor of psychiatric research at the university, said: ""It is now well known that use of cannabis increases the risk of psychosis. ""However, sceptics still claim that this is not an important cause of schizophrenia-like psychosis. ""This paper suggests that we could prevent almost one quarter of cases of psychosis if no one smoked high-potency cannabis. ""This could save young patients a lot of suffering and the NHS a lot of money."" While skunk was associated with psychotic episodes, the milder form of cannabis known as hash had no such link, the scientists said. The study looked at 800 people aged between 18 and 65 in south London, including 410 who had suffered psychosis and 370 healthy patients."

Last year, Forbes ranked the family 30th on the list of the world's richest billionaires with a fortune of around £15bn. The Ferrero group's products also includes Tic Tacs and Kinder chocolate eggs. Italian President Sergio Mattarella praised Mr Ferrero. Michele Ferrero developed Ferrero Rocher chocolates in 1982 He said: ""I have learnt with emotion of the passing of Michele Ferrero, a true entrepreneur, known and loved in Italy and abroad. ""Ferrero was a leading light in Italian business for many years, always managing to stay on trend thanks to his innovative products and his tenacious and cautious work. ""Italy remembers him with gratitude."" Mr Ferrero's father, Pietro, started making Nutella when cocoa was still rationed during World War Two. Pietro opened his first chocolate laboratory in Alba, in Italy's northwest Piemonte region, in 1942 and the business was passed to Michele after his father's death in 1949. Michele developed Kinder chocolates in 1968, Tic Tacs a year later and Ferrero Rocher in 1982. By 1997, he had handed over the running of the company to his two sons, Pietro and Giovanni. Pietro died in 2011 after suffering a cardiac arrest, leaving Giovanni the sole chief executive. Michele Ferrero is survived by his wife, Maria Franca, and Giovanni."

More than 250,000 people were expected to attend the street parade in the northern city of Braunschweig. But shortly before it was due to start, police told people to stay at home after receiving credible information that an attack was imminent. Police spokesman Thomas Geese said the event was cancelled 90 minutes before its scheduled start time, adding: ""Many people arriving at the train station from out of town were already dressed up and very disappointed - but we didn't want to take any risks."" Officials do not believe the threat is connected to two fatal attacks in Copenhagen. Ulrich Markurth, the Mayor of Braunschweig, said the cancellation of the yearly carnival was ""a sad day for our city and a sad day for our democratic society"". The event - which coincides with the Roman Catholic carnival season - would have seen bands and 4,000 people in fancy dress costumes march down a four-mile route through the city. Organisers have said the bands will perform their live music at the town hall instead. Police have confirmed the warning came from intelligence sources, but have refused to provide any further information about the threat."

Mr Johnson - who is running for parliament in Uxbridge and South Ruislip - said he would discuss the matter with US ambassador Matthew Barzun. ""It is a laborious business.

Aides said the mayor's priority was to avoid paying more tax to US authorities, after he was recently forced to settle a large capital gains tax bill."

The charity also says patients and their families understand doctors and nurses are not always able to answer their questions, but should be kept informed about their care. Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said: ""Today's themes report demonstrates that too often patients and their families are treated without compassion, are uninformed about treatment and next steps, feel ignored and sidelined when they raise concerns or complaints.

Whether it's television ad campaigns or children's toys, if companies are trying to get women to open their wallets they think pink. Now Labour is following suit, launching a ""Woman to Woman"" campaign to speak to female voters in a van coloured (you guessed it) pink. It's immediately drawn comparisons to Barbie, Penelope Pitstop and Sheila's Wheels on social media. When I asked Harriet Harman whether the colour could be considered patronising, she replied: ""We wanted to mark that this was something different. ""We wanted it to look conspicuous and therefore a white van was not going to do the job. ""This is a One Nation Labour colour."" Although the shade of the van is dominating the headlines, the campaign has serious aims. At the last election, 9.1 million women didn't cast a vote, with young women in particular disproportionately likely to switch off from politics. The Labour campaign aims to visit 70 constituencies before the election, talking to female voters to re-engage and listen to some of their concerns. Issues like childcare, parliamentary representation and domestic violence will be priorities. It's hard to disagree with Harriet Harman when she says: ""I don't think it's at all patronising to recognise that women have got different patterns of their working lives, there's different patterns in families between what women do and what men do. ""That is to recognise the reality and to say public policy needs to address that."" But does it have to be in a pink bus? Gender stereotypes like pink toys for girls are pernicious because they fuel the notion that women are all the same. It is all too easy for Labour's detractors to use the pink bus as evidence the party is pigeon-holing women in the same way. Ms Harman is right that women are under-represented in Westminster and too many female voters aren't making it to the ballot box. It would be a shame if the colour of the bus obscured her key message."
2015-02-16,A political row has erupted over allegations of tax dodging tied to a Swiss subsidiary of HSBC.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150216132154/http://news.sky.com/story/1426067/hsbc-tax-dodging-claims-what-is-the-row-about,"A political row has erupted over allegations of tax dodging tied to a Swiss subsidiary of HSBC. David Cameron has been accused of not asking questions of former HSBC chief executive Steven Green - whom he later appointed a Lord in 2010 and Conservative minister. The man who blew the whistle on tax dodging allegations has told Sky News he first raised concerns seven years ago and that British investigators have only received a ""tiny part"" of the information on HSBC. Here is how the allegations have emerged. :: What is the row about? HSBC's Geneva branch is facing allegations that its staff encouraged customers to dodge tax payments. Herve Falciani, the whistleblower who leaked tens of thousands of account details from the branch in 2007, told Sky News he first contacted HMRC in 2008. Details of thousands of UK-based clients of the branch were handed to HMRC in May 2010, with press reports showing HSBC involvement in tax avoidance appearing in September that year. Another French source has handed the full data to Le Monde newspaper, which then passed it on to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. The bank now admits problems in controls and compliance at the branch in the period before 2008, which has caused political controversy in Greece, Spain, India, France, Belgium and now the UK. :: Why is David Cameron embroiled in the row? The allegations of compliance and control problems at HSBC's Swiss subsidiary occurred at a time when Lord Green was chief executive and then chairman of the bank. Lord Green was then made a lord, trade minister and was appointed to a Cabinet committee on post-banking crisis reform by David Cameron - after HMRC had received details of thousands of Britons suspected of avoiding taxes with the help of HSBC. Wealthy donors to political parties were among those who legally held accounts with HSBC's Swiss branch. The Guardian newspaper published a list of nine Conservative Party donors who it said were listed in files relating to clients of HSBC's Swiss subsidiary. The Labour party has demanded the Prime Minister make it clear whether he talked to Lord Green about tax-dodging allegations linked to the bank before he was appointed as a minister. :: Who else is tied up in the allegations? Labour leader Ed Miliband accused Lord Fink in the House of Commons of seeking to avoid paying taxes by holding a Swiss bank account.  Lord Fink, who gave £3m to the Conservative Party, was appointed party treasurer and given a peerage by Mr Cameron. The Tory peer has said the claim was ""untrue and defamatory"" and challenged Mr Miliband to repeat the allegation outside Parliament - where he would not be protected from legal action by parliamentary privilege - or withdraw it publicly. But Lord Fink subsequently acknowledged he did take steps to avoid paying tax, although he insisted they were at ""the mildest end of the spectrum"". It led Mr Miliband to challenge the Prime Minister over whether he agreed with Lord Fink that ""everyone"" engages in the practice, which is not illegal. Mr Cameron also told the House of Commons that Labour donor Lord Paul was also caught up in the revelations. Lord Paul has said he had a Swiss bank account because he had a house in the country. :: What is happening about the claims? Representatives from HSBC and HM Revenue and Customs will give evidence to MPs about the allegations. More than 6,000 names are understood to have been passed to HMRC. UK tax authorities say they have pursued around 1,100, recovering £135m in unpaid tax, fines and interest."
2015-02-16,A 22-year-old with a history of violence and criminal gang involvement has been identified by police as the suspect behind two deadly shootings in Denmark.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150216132154/http://news.sky.com/story/1427747/danish-shooting-suspect-had-violent-history,"A 22-year-old with a history of violence and criminal gang involvement has been identified by police as the suspect behind two deadly shootings in Denmark. Danish media named the suspect as Omar el-Hussein, a man police say was born in Denmark and had a criminal record which included convictions for violence and weapons offences. The Ekstra-Bladet newspaper reported that he was released from jail two weeks ago after serving a term for aggravated assault. El-Hussein was wanted by police in November 2013 for stabbing a fellow passenger on a train, it added. Police at the scene where the suspect was shot dead This was backed by a Danish police statement issued in 2013 describing an incident in which a man identified as Omar el-Hussein had stabbed a train passenger repeatedly with ""a big knife"". He was shot dead by police near a Copenhagen train station after opening fire on officers, following an attack at a cafe on Saturday afternoon and another deadly assault two miles away at the city's main synagogue. Police believe the gunman was inspired by last month's Paris shootings, where Islamists targeted the offices of the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine and a kosher supermarket. Investigators said there was nothing to suggest at present that other gunmen were involved in the Copenhagen shootings, which left two people dead and five police officers wounded. They also said they did not believe the gunman had been to overseas jihadist training camps. The attack at the synagogue in Krystalgade just after midnight UK time saw one man killed after he was shot in the head and two policemen also shot, one in the arm and the other in the leg. Armed Danish police also raided an internet cafe near where officers killed the suspected gunman, taking at least two people into custody, according to Danish media. Sky News cameraman Pete Milnes, who was in a hotel next to the synagogue, said: ""There was a succession of about six or seven gunshots. ""Within a minute or so, armed police were on the scene, a helicopter was hovering overhead. I witnessed police apprehend an individual who was handcuffed and later released. Gallery: Two Killed In Cafe And Synagogue Shootings Two people have been killed and five police officers were injured in two shootings in the Danish capital Copenhagen. This is the scene of the cafe attack on Saturday ""There were 20 to 30 armed police officers with semi-automatic rifles shouting at locals to stay indoors and close windows."" The victim has been named as 37-year-old Jewish man Dan Uzan, who was guarding a building behind the synagogue. A major manhunt had earlier been launched after one man was killed and three police officers injured when a gunman opened fire at a cafe where a meeting on free speech was taking place. The seminar, which was targeted just before 3pm UK time on Saturday, was attended by Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who has been threatened with death for his cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed. He was not harmed, but 55-year-old documentary film maker Finn Noergaard died. Around 30 bullet holes were seen in the windows of the venue in the north of the city. Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt described that assault as ""a terrorist attack""."

Ashraf Amrani, 30,  was found unresponsive then pronounced dead on the roof of a flat in west London on Friday afternoon. Police say he had been arrested for affray on 10 February and was due to answer bail on Wednesday. The next day officers went to a flat in the same street to inform his next of kin, but discovered the bodies of a man and woman - believed to be Amrani's parents Hassan and Zara.  Police are treating Ashraf Amrani's death as unexplained but the couple are believed to have died in suspicious circumstances and police have launched a murder investigation. A court official confirmed that in June 2010 the 30-year-old had been jailed for seven years and two months after being found guilty of rape at Southwark Crown Court. A neighbour who lives in the same street - Westbourne Park Road near the Portobello Road Market - said police had been called to the couple's flat on Thursday but a man, believed to be the couple's son, had tried to block them from going inside. She said: ""My brother told me that police had been round and they were looking for the son and opened the door. ""He got the impression he was in there and not letting them in. She added: ""The last time I saw the wife was on Thursday and she didn't look happy. She looked a bit fed up and sad. ""We were walking into the estate together and she said she wanted to go back to Morocco. She was a bit fed up. ""She said her husband had called her and said there was some trouble in the house."" The neighbour, who asked not to be named, said the couple doted on their grandson, who is believed to be around seven or eight years old. ""They were just a really nice couple. I'm just so shocked. They were always so nice,"" she said. ""She would always go and see her daughter and grandson. The husband was a very quiet man. They had an extremely beautiful house. She kept everything immaculate."" Forensics officers wearing light blue protective clothing and white masks are continuing to search the flat."

The New Zealand judge took over the inquiry after two other senior figures were forced to step down over establishment links. The investigation is expected to focus on allegations of alleged wrongdoing dating back to 1970, but Justice Goddard says this could be extended. The 66-year-old told The Mail On Sunday that fixed cut-off points for inquiries are ""artificial"". ""The terms of reference talk about going back to 1970, but there is a push from certain quarters to take it back to about 1945,"" she said. ""A cut-off point is always a bit artificial - someone who falls on the wrong side of it is aggrieved."" The newspaper said Home Secretary Theresa May supports Justice Goddard's position on the possibility of extending the terms of reference. Justice Goddard said she ""wouldn't shrink"" from summoning prominent people to give evidence at the inquiry. ""I don't feel intimidated. Nobody should be beyond the reach of the law,"" she said. ""Sexual abuse of little children has never been anything short of a serious crime and that does not alter through religious or cultural mores or a different era or time. ""If criminal offending is evident it will be handed to police. There are people who need to be given a voice about what has happened to them."""

The company has revealed few details about the new model, but said it decided to develop a luxury off-roader following consultations with clients. ""Many discerning customers have urged us to develop this new car - and we have listened,"" the company said in a statement. ""At Rolls-Royce Motor Cars we are uniquely focused on the desires of our customers and are driven by our own thirst to innovate.

The vehicle will be developed at the company's base in Goodwood. Rolls-Royce has gradually expanded its range of vehicles beyond luxury limousines such as the Phantom model, released in 2003. The smaller Ghost II became available in late 2014, and the Wraith Coupe entered showrooms in 2013. Last month, Jaguar Land Rover announced the creation of 1,300 new jobs after the company said it would develop its first SUV vehicle in Britain. Gallery: Rolling Back The Years The first design sketches of a new Rolls-Royce to be launched in 2010 have been released by the luxury car company. Known as the RR4, the new vehicle will be smaller than the existing Phantom and will be powered by a new engine unique to Rolls-Royce. The jobs will be created at Jaguar's Solihull plant."

The Police Service of Northern Ireland said a Taser was used during Derek Brockwell's capture. Earlier this week, the 53-year-old had escaped after he was taken to Tallaght Hospital in south Dublin for a medical appointment. It is believed an accomplice on a motorbike helped him. According to the Irish Prison Service, one prison officer was stabbed in the stomach with a knife and needed emergency surgery. Another was stabbed in the hand and possibly the face or neck during the incident on Tuesday afternoon. Brockwell is a British national who is two years into a seven-year sentence. As well as being convicted of firearms offences, he had admitted holding up a bank, a post office and a bookmakers. PSNI Detective Sergeant Kenneth Leckey said: ""A man unlawfully at large from the Republic of Ireland was located by police in Belfast city centre following a police operation this evening.

With limited space and prices that have gone through the roof, one survey suggests bricks and mortar could be as significant as the NHS in the ballot this May. According to research by estate agents Your Move and Reeds Rains, one in six tenants (16%) say housing is the issue most likely to affect their vote. Sky News visited what has been billed as the smallest house currently on the market in the UK. The tiny one-room home in Islington is just over 150 square feet, with an asking price of £275,000.  You have to climb on to the kitchen surface to get into bed, the dining room is a pull-out table, and you can touch opposite walls at the same time. ""Obviously the price is quite absurd but I don't think the project is absurd,"" says architect Chris Dyvik, who took inspiration from caravans and boats. ""You might see similar types of compact units being built. People need to be creative in London to survive with these housing prices."" It is unlikely anyone would live in such a place for more than a few nights at a time, but the fact that such a small space can command such a big asking price means questions continue to be asked about London's property bubble. Last year, some 60,000 30-somethings left London, the highest number ever. Soaring house prices have put homes out of reach for most first-time buyers. According to the Office for National Statistics, 67% of the 25 to 34 age group were homeowners in 1991. By 2012 this had dropped to 43%. George Cheetham got fed up with prices going up and up during the buying frenzy in London last year. ""Week-by-week, house prices grew,"" he said. ""You'd go for a viewing in the same street one week and by the next it had gone up by about £10,000."" He moved to Bristol, buying a three-bedroom flat with a garden, something which would have been impossible in the capital. ""It just didn't seem a realistic market to buy in, it was very easy for us to say enough is enough"" he said. Soaring prices have been partly driven by foreign investors. Estate agent Savills estimates up to 70% of newly-built properties in central London are bought by foreign investors, with many flats in prime locations lying empty. Gallery: Property: What £1m Can Buy You We take a look at what £1m can buy you around the UK. For example this one bedroom flat in Chelsea's Lennox Gardens, London, at exactly £1m. All photos courtesy of rightmove.co.uk Campaigners say many are ""buy-to-leave"" - expensive flats bought purely as an investment. For investors from China, Russia and the Middle East, London is often seen as a safer bet than buying at home. Some councils now intend to charge owners who leave homes gathering dust. Councillor James Murray says Islington is one London borough looking at the issue. ""What we would hope is that if we write to an owner and they realise we have found them out, they would then at least rent it out or maybe even sell it on to someone who wanted to live there,"" he says. ""If they didn't, we could then go to the court to get an injunction and in due course the High Court could take whatever action they thought was appropriate to enforce it."" Chinese businessman Liang Huang buys and rents out properties in London, often to young professionals. ""It's quite stable, people are friendly and the finance environment is very safe,"" he said. ""Money comes in, they feel quite safe, secure, the return will be guaranteed."" A glut of posh developments, new capital gains legislation for foreign buyers and stamp duty changes have cooled the market somewhat. But foreign investors and a shortage of new affordable homes means London is still a world apart from the rest of the country."

Amateur video shows the musician, best known for 2001 hit Because I Got High, playing the guitar when the female fan begins dancing close to him. He is seen swinging around and striking the woman in her face, knocking her to the ground. TMZ reports that the woman was left crying and bleeding, but that the 40-year-old artist continued performing until the house lights were turned off at the show in Biloxi, Mississippi. The website said the musician, real name Joseph Edgar Foreman, was handcuffed outside the venue and taken into custody before being released after paying a $330 (£214) bond. In a Skype interview with TMZ Afroman said he would be having treatment for anger management. He also said he did not realise the girl was on stage and had believed she was a male heckler.

Employment Minister Esther McVey has said the one thing that no MP ever admits to: She wants to be Prime Minister. Asked if she wanted the top job during a Loose Women interview, the Tory MP responded: ""If I had to give a yes or a no, I'll be honest and say ‘yes’. It's about women, the motivation is women."" You only have to work in Westminster for five minutes before you realise that every politician harbours a secret desire to run the country - and they all privately believe they would be brilliant at it (even if to any independent observer that is patently not the case.) Even the most viciously ambitious politician will vociferously deny they aspire to the top job (Boris Johnson anyone?) So it’s rather refreshing that Ms McVey is prepared to stick her neck out and admit that, yes, she would quite like to be Prime Minister. She went on to say: ""Girls need role models, they must see women who have succeeded and achieved from their background. ""They believe they can do it because that person is from the same background as me, looks like me, sounds like me - that could be me. I’ve brought a bit of me into my job.” Ms McVey’s chances of being Prime Minister are - currently - slim. Conservative MPs I’ve spoken to are sceptical that she's a serious contender for the leadership. Boris Johnson, George Osborne, Theresa May and Sajid Javid are the names most often spoken of. She also faces the rather important challenge of hanging on to her marginal Wirral West seat in May’s General Election. But the Conservative party could do a lot worse. Ms McVey is a straight-talking Northern female who does not fit the stereotype of male Tory toffs. She's also battle-hardened after ministerial roles in the Department of Work and Pensions, where’s she’s been in the firing line for controversial welfare changes. Plus - importantly - she comes across as a human being first, and a politician second."

An operation is under way to contain any risk of pollution and free Lysblink Seaways, which has nine people on board. The alarm was raised at around 1.50am on Wednesday when the vessel became stuck off Kilchoan, north of the Isle of Mull, in the West Highlands. The ship, thought to be carrying paper, did not refloat at high tide at 4.35am. Tugs are expected to try to free the vessel and the Tobermory lifeboat is at the scene. So far, no-one has been reported injured. An emergency towing vessel will try to refloat the stranded ship A spokesman for the RNLI said: ""Tobermory RNLI's volunteer crew launched the Severn class lifeboat, Elizabeth Fairlie Ramsey, shortly after 3am to go to the aid of the vessel which was hard aground on rocks close to the ferry slipway.

2015-02-19,A competition inquiry into the energy market has found suppliers routinely charging loyal customers up to £234 more per year.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150219075137/http://news.sky.com/story/1429480/energy-big-six-profit-from-switching-failure,"A competition inquiry into the energy market has found suppliers routinely charging loyal customers up to £234 more per year. The Competition and Markets Authority's (CMA) update on its continuing probe into the sector also contained criticism of the energy regulator's powers - as reported by Sky News on Tuesday evening - saying excessive regulation at Ofgem may be creating barriers to new market entrants. The key finding in the CMA's updated Issues Statement for consumers concerned the power of switching supplier, with the regulator declaring that long-term customers - many deemed vulnerable - were paying a higher price for failing to move between energy companies. It said 95% of dual fuel customers of the so-called big six suppliers could have saved an average of between £158 and £234 a year by switching. It found British Gas, SSE, Scottish Power, E.ON, npower and EDF, earned 12% more from a customer on a standard - instead of fixed - dual fuel tariff. The report stated: ""The evidence that we have seen to date also suggests that the gross margins that the six large energy firms earn are higher for customers on the SVT (Standard Variable Tariff) than for those on non-standard tariffs over the last three years.""  While the Issues Statement does not contain any formal conclusions by the CMA, the ongoing designation of industry regulation as a key focus will embarrass Ofgem at a time when its leadership is under intense political pressure. Labour has vowed to freeze prices for 20 months if it wins the General Election in May, a pledge which sparked fury among big six suppliers. They recently cut standard gas tariffs by up to 5.1% in response to a 30% dip in wholesale prices but argue raw energy makes up less than 50% of a bill and they have to pay up to three years up front for their supplies. They point to the growing cost of green levies and network costs. Crucially for the big six suppliers, the CMA found that their average profit margin across gas and electricity was 3.3%, with gas being the more profitable of the two. But the report questions whether the market is working for consumers as almost half of households have been with the same supplier for more than 10 years. This week, the Government launched a campaign with the slogan ""Power To Switch"", which is designed to encourage consumers to shop around to find cheaper energy deals. Provisional findings of the CMA's inquiry will be published in May. It is expected to stop short of recommending that the big six firms split their generation and supply arms - as some critics have demanded - to give greater clarity on profits. Energy UK, the industry body which speaks for suppliers, said: ""The energy industry continues to support the work of the Competition and Markets Authority and has already introduced a range of voluntary measures, moving towards greater openness and transparency. ""Today is the next stage in the process with conclusions expected later this year. The industry will review today's releases over the coming weeks with a view to engaging further with the investigation. Individual members will be able to contribute to the debate as the rest of the investigation progresses."""

Derek Brockwell was being taken to Tallaght Hospital in south Dublin from high security Portlaoise Prison for a medical appointment when he made his escape. One of the prison officers with him was stabbed in the stomach with a knife and needed emergency surgery, a spokesman for the Irish Prison Service said. Another officer was stabbed in the hand and possibly the face or neck during the incident at around 3pm. A third prison officer was unharmed but left badly shaken. It is believed Brockwell, a British national who was handed 22 life sentences in the UK for armed robbery, was picked up by a waiting accomplice and driven away from the scene. The 53-year-old was two years into a seven-year sentence after he admitted holding up the Bank of Ireland in Blackrock, south Dublin, in October 2012. He was also convicted of robbing a post office and a bookmakers, and firearms offences in the Irish capital. Brockwell landed in Ireland after failing to return to Kirkham Prison in England, where he was serving his life sentences and been allowed out on day release as part of a work scheme. He had carried out armed robberies on betting shops in London's Marylebone and Paddington areas during September and October 1999. Described as 6ft 3in with brown hair and a broad build, he is believed to have links with London, Glasgow and Ireland. Gardai have launched a city-wide manhunt and have said they are ""anxious"" to capture him. A spokesman for the Irish Prison Service said: ""A full investigation has commenced into the circumstances of this escape.

The design of racing cars, boat hulls and aircraft are among the possible uses for a hard material known as goethite, which forms inside the limpet as it grows. Researchers at the University of Portsmouth say the snail-like creature's teeth contain material stronger than spider's silk - the material previously considered to be nature's strongest. The properties of limpet teeth were discovered by pulling them apart all the way down to the level of the atom. Australian driver Daniel Ricciardo behind the wheel for Red Bull Racing The creatures use their high-strength teeth to cling to rock surfaces and remove algae for food. Professor Asa Barber, who led the study, said it may be possible to mimic the structure of limpet teeth for design purposes. ""We discovered that the fibres of goethite are just the right size to make up a resilient composite structure,"" he said. ""This discovery means that the fibrous structures found in limpet teeth could be mimicked and used in high-performance engineering applications such as Formula One racing cars, the hulls of boats and aircraft structures. Spider silk was previously thought to be the strongest biological material ""Engineers are always interested in making these structures stronger to improve their performance or lighter so they use less material."" Using the designs found in nature to develop man-made structures is a process known as ""bio-inspiration"". Prof Barber added: ""Biology is a great source of inspiration when designing new structures but with so many biological structures to consider, it can take time to discover which may be useful."" The results of the study have been published in the Royal Society journal Interface."

With a Competition and Markets Authority report indicating many customers are paying a high price for failing to make a change, there are several simple steps anyone wanting to switch can take. :: Check if you are eligible for financial help. Anyone of pensionable age, on a low income or with a disability could be entitled to assistance through a variety of schemes including some listed here. :: Check a series of market comparison websites, using your energy bills or annual summary, to establish which supplier offers you the best deal. :: Once you have chosen a new supplier, they will manage the switch with the firm you are leaving. The change could take up to eight weeks. :: It is also possible to reverse your decision - you have the right to cancel a contract within 14 working days. :: Switching suppliers is not an effective method of avoiding a backlog of bills and you may need to pay off any debt to your current supplier before you make the change. :: Anyone looking to switch should also check the terms and conditions on both their old and new deals. Fixed-term contracts may involve a charge to change suppliers. Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis said everyone should check if they could save money on energy bills. ""We need to shout loud about the benefits of switching tariff,"" he said. ""Too many people think energy firms are 'all the same'. That's far from true, there are huge differences on both price and customer service. ""The worry is that news of recent price cuts, even though they were paltry, will have given many false confidence that they're on a decent deal. Examine the figures and the ugly truth is very different. ""Even after price cuts, someone on a Big Six supplier standard tariff with typical use will pay £1,158 a year, whereas switch to the cheapest tariff and they'd pay just over £900 a year. ""So it's worth people taking 10 minutes to see if they can save themselves £250 - at an hourly rate of £1,500 if someone else was offering this to you as work, would you turn it down?"""

It is a view supported by Tory MP Nadine Dorries, while her backbench colleague, Conor Burns, told Sky News the clergymen had got it ""factually wrong"". So what is the truth? :: Well, there is a fair bit of cross party bashing in there The Bishops say people are hungry for a ""new approach to political life"" but conclude ""no such thing is yet on offer for 2015"". ""Our democracy is failing,"" they say, with none of the different parties offering ""attractive visions of the kind of society and culture they wish to see"". Instead all we have are ""sterile"" arguments, they add. :: But the coalition Government is certainly singled out  The Bishops insist that the ""greatest burdens of austerity have not been borne by those with the broadest shoulders"". It is that charge that Mr Burns MP says is ""factually wrong"". They complain about levels of in-work poverty, calling for a Living Wage - something talked most about by Labour's Ed Miliband - although without any promise to make it a statutory requirement. :: And it is fair to say that the Tories probably get the hardest ride  Take the Big Society - David Cameron's big idea in 2010, which senior advisers have virtually dropped from the party's rhetoric. The Bishops say the policy ""should not be consigned to the political dustbin"". They also talk of the burgeoning levels of ""in work poverty"", arguing in favour of the Living Wage - an idea that Labour has been pushing hardest (although without any statutory promises). On welfare, the Bishops say they don't like the way the sick, disabled or terminally ill are talked about, and ask why those on benefits are depicted as being ""undeserving"". That could be seen as critical of a Conservative party that has taken a tough line on welfare, but the Prime Minister would argue that the Bishops might support his position, arguing that there is nothing kind about paying people to be idle. The clergymen also call for a rethink on Trident, which will certainly annoy some Tory backbenchers, although this is arguably just as critical of Labour’s position. :: And there is some Labour bashing too The Bishops don't like the rekindling of the ""language of class"" nor the depiction of ""them"" and ""some fictitious us"". They mention attacks ethnic minorities and claimants but also on ""bankers and oligarchs”. Turning those groups into the ""hated other"" is ironic, they say, given how the whole political class is often regarded as alien to large parts of the population. :: And finally… the Lib Dems The Bishops argue that this isn't about ""left"" versus ""right"". But add: ""Nor are we trying to split the difference imagining that the truth lies equidistant between extremes"". That sounds rather like Nick Clegg's election policy - so I guess that is them out too…"

The teenager, a pupil at the same Enniskillen school as Oisin, was questioned by officers before being released on bail pending further enquiries. The 13-year-old from Belcoo, County Fermanagh, died in hospital three days after an altercation at St Michael's College. On medical advice, his parents decided to withdraw their teenage son's life support and donate his organs for transplant. Father Seamus Quinn paid tribute to Oisin, a budding musician and sportsman, at his funeral on Sunday. ""He was forever smiling, a big wide happy grin etched on his face,"" he said. ""He was a natural, unaffected young lad, quiet and easy to be with, the kind of smile that drew the best out of you, whether you were young or old. ""Because of his parents' incredibly selfless and faith-based decision, Oisin's falling on the ground and dying like a grain of wheat has brought life to five other human beings."""

Bodies with surgical incisions and missing kidneys, or other body parts, have been found in shallow mass graves over the past few weeks, Mohamed Alhakim told the media. ""We have bodies. Come and examine them,"" he said. ""It is clear they are missing certain parts."" A dozen doctors had been ""executed"" in Mosul for refusing to participate in the practice, he added. Mr Alhakim accused IS of ""crimes of genocide"" by targeting certain ethnic groups as he briefed the UN Security Council on the overall situation in Iraq.

Continue through for more images The outgoing UN envoy to Iraq, Nikolay Mladenov, told the council that in January alone 790 people had been killed by terrorism and armed conflict. Mr Mladenov noted increasing reports that Islamic State - also known as ISIL - was using organ harvesting as a financing method, but said only: ""It's very clear that the tactics ISIL is using expand by the day"".  Iraq's most pressing goal, he said, was to win back the vast territory seized by the group. The militants have seized a third of both Iraq and neighbouring Syria and imposed strict Sharia law. ""Especially worrying is the increasing number of reports of revenge attacks committed particularly against members of the Sunni community in areas liberated from ISIL control,"" Mr Mladenov added."

The club has condemned the supporters' behaviour as ""abhorrent"" and says it will support any criminal action against them. They are believed to have been travelling to the Parc des Princes stadium for a Champions League game against Paris Saint Germain, which ended in a 1-1 draw. The Metropolitan Police said it was aware of the incident and was working with the French authorities. The Parc des Princes stadium in Paris It said: ""We will examine the footage with a view to seeing if we can apply for football banning orders, preventing people from travelling from future matches."" Footage on The Guardian newspaper's website shows the commuter trying to board a metro train at Richelieu-Drouot station. A group of supporters are seen shouting and gesturing at the man and chanting ""Chelsea, Chelsea, Chelsea"", before pushing him away as he tries to step into the carriage. The man attempts to get on the train again, pointing to a space where he could stand, but is pushed back once more as he moves forward. The fans then chant: ""We're racist, we're racist, and that's the way we like it."" The supporters are also heard chanting: ""Where were you in World War Two?"" British expatriate Paul Nolan, who filmed the incident, said: ""He was obviously completely shocked when they pushed him off. ""I don't think he realised who they were. He then tried to get on again and got pushed off a second time."" Chelsea vowed to take ""the strongest possible"" action if members are found to have been involved and appealed for anyone with information to come forward. A club statement said: ""We will support any criminal action against those involved, and should evidence point to involvement of Chelsea season-ticket holders or members the club will take the strongest possible action against them, including banning orders."" A Chelsea fan at the scene defended the actions of the group, insisting they were chanting about club captain John Terry and that other passengers were also prevented from boarding the train. Mitchell McCoy, 17, said: ""I'm not in the video but I'm on the carriage. We got on the train and at the station where the man was trying to get on we stopped for a couple of minutes. ""He tried to get on and a few people were pushing him off because there wasn't much space. You couldn't move. ""People were saying it was because he was black. It's not true at all."" Mr McCoy said the song was about Terry, who was banned for four matches by the Football Association for racially abusing QPR's Anton Ferdinand in 2011. The regulatory commission which ruled on the case stated that the Chelsea captain was ""not a racist"". Kick It Out chairman Lord Ouseley condemned the fans' behaviour and said the anti-discrimination body would support any prosecutions. Prime Minister David Cameron told LBC Radio: ""This does look extremely disturbing and very worrying. It's obviously potentially a criminal offence and so I'm sure the French police will be looking at it very seriously."" UEFA, European football's governing body, also condemned the incident, but said it was unable to act because it happened away from the stadium. A French police spokesman said they had received no complaints."

Care assistant Leonie Granger, 25, is on trial at the Old Bailey accused for her part in the murder of 56-year-old Mehmet Hassan last March. Mr Hassan was tied up and kicked to death while his alleged killers filmed themselves throwing his cash winnings around his London flat, jurors were told. The professional gambler did not realise he was a ""soft target"" for the the woman he was treating to champagne at a smart London restaurant, the court heard. After the meal, Granger reported back to her boyfriend and his friend that Mr Hassan, a divorced father of three, was ""flashy"" and had ""never worked a day in his life"". Prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC told jurors how Granger, boyfriend Kyrron Jackson and his friend Nicholas Chandler had planned the sting in February 2014 after the care assistant met her victim at a Mayfair hotel. The two men, both aged 28, had previously been involved in two armed robberies on the Grosvenor Casino, but with limited success. Reading out a series of text messages, Mr Aylett said Granger had introduced herself as Rachel ""so it rather looks as though Mehmet Hassan was being set up from the very first"". The victim suggested they meet for ""a couple of glasses of champagne"" and dinner at Knightsbridge restaurant Zuma. He texted her: ""I live in Islington and I'm a professional poker player. Don't laugh Rachel because believe me I am quite good. ""Maybe with your brains and my money we can make you in to a great player."" Her reply was not recorded but he answered back: ""Funds is my department Rachel plus it would be my pleasure to have the opportunity to wine and dine you."" However, on the night they were due to meet, she appeared to say there was a problem as he went on alone to the Palm Beach Casino in Mayfair, saying: ""Such a shame. Was really looking forward to tonight. The main thing is your ok Rachel (sic)"". But they agreed to meet up the next Saturday and go out for dinner and then to the Playboy Casino in Mayfair, the court heard. Mr Aylett said the pair stayed there for around an hour before Mr Hassan called it a day, leaving with £1,900 in cash. They then went to the gambler's flat but Granger left in a minicab soon afterwards. The cab driver recalled Granger telling someone on her mobile phone ""flashy"" Mr Hassan had been showing off, saying: ""This guy is a professional gambler. He has never worked a day in his life."" Mr Aylett said: ""The prosecution suggest that it must have already been agreed between Miss Granger, Kyrron Jackson and Nicholas Chandler that Miss Granger would find a soft target with ready cash in order that Jackson and Chandler might rob him. ""After all, Jackson and Chandler had had to go to a deal of trouble to rob the Grosvenor Casino. Thus far, the haul on the first robbery had amounted to £10,000 to be split four ways and the second robbery had been a disaster."" He went on: ""The prosecution suggest Jackson and Chandler had moved on from targeting casinos to someone who frequented the casino and had sums of very ready cash."" Granger, of Gillingham, Kent, is charged with Mr Hassan's murder and false imprisonment alongside Jackson, of Lewisham, and Chandler, of Lee High Road, southeast London. The two men are further charged with robbing Mr Hassan, two counts of plotting to rob employees of Grosvenor Casinos, two counts of conspiracy to have a shotgun and imitation firearm in January last year, and two counts of conspiracy to falsely imprison. The trial continues."

The crucial target was not met in the second week of February - with just 91.6% of patients being admitted, transferred or discharged in the four hours after they arrive at a ward. In comparison, 92.9% of casualty patients were treated in line with NHS England's expectations in the seven days to 8 February. ""Last week saw a sharp increase in A&E attendance and emergency admissions - up by nearly 15,000 on the week before. These are the highest levels since Christmas and are also up on the same week last year,"" said Dr Barbara Hakin of NHS England. An estimated 420,700 patients went to an accident and emergency department last week. This admissions figure is the highest seen since the week before Christmas, when 446,473 attendances were recorded. Dr Hakin added: ""This has resulted in a slight impact on waiting times, but we continue to admit, treat and discharge more than nine out of ten patients within four hours."" In recent weeks, the Royal College of Nursing has said the system is in crisis - with chronic underfunding and staffing shortages to blame. A growing number of NHS hospitals have had to declare ""major incidents"" as they struggle to cope with the rising number of admissions. ""Bed blocking"" also continues to be a serious issue - and last week, 4,000 hospital beds were unavailable because of delays in transferring patients who could be discharged to other care facilities."

Police said the close friends were last seen on Tuesday morning as they left their homes telling their families they would be out for the day. Instead they met and travelled to Gatwick airport before boarding a Turkish Airlines flight, which landed at Istanbul that evening. The three - Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and a third female aged 15 who is not being named at the request of her family - are pupils at Bethnal Green Academy and have been described as ""straight-A students"". Metropolitan Police Commander Richard Walton said he was ""extremely concerned"" for their safety. He revealed the runaways are good friends with another 15-year-old girl who fled to Syria in December. Kadiza Sultana, 16, Shamima Begum, 15, and an unnamed 15-year-old ""We are concerned about the numbers of girls and young women who have or are intending to travel to the part of Syria that is controlled by the terrorist group calling themselves Islamic State,"" Mr Walton said. ""It is an extremely dangerous place and we have seen reports of what life is like for them and how restricted their lives become. ""It is not uncommon for girls or women to be prevented from being allowed out of their houses or if allowed out, only when accompanied by a guardian. ""The choice of returning home from Syria is often taken away from those under the control of Islamic State, leaving their families in the UK devastated and with very few options to secure their safe return."" Mr Walton added the teenagers' families were ""devastated"" but there was a ""good chance"" the girls were still in Turkey. All three have mobile phones, and police are using Turkish media and social media in the hopes of reaching them. Salman Farsi, spokesman for their local East London Mosque, said: ""They have been misled. I do not know what was promised to them. It is just sad. We have not had anything like this before in our community. ""I think the girls need to know they have done nothing wrong. They have been manipulated."" The girls are students at Bethnal Green Academy, east London A family friend of one of the missing girls told Sky News: ""It's really sad what has happened. ""Maybe they need to educate people more, tell them about the risks of going to Syria, that it's not safe out there."" Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: ""The idea of 15-year-old British schoolgirls setting off to Syria is very disturbing, and shows that more action is urgently needed to stop young people being drawn into extremism and conflict, and to help families and communities who are trying to counteract extremist recruitment messages."" The number of Westerners who have travelled to Iraq and Syria to join IS is thought to be about 3,000, including as many as 550 women, according to the London-based Institute for Strategic Dialogue. Former Metropolitan Police border control officer Chris Hobbs told Sky News that checks for people departing from UK airports made it a ""walk in the park for jihadis and girls like this"" to leave. ""At the moment you go through security, you get on the plane, you might be checked by a private security guard,"" he said. ""Unless you're very unlucky you won't pass under the eyes of anyone from UK law enforcement. ""If you're on a watch list then you will ping the system. If you're not on the radar then the odds are you will get on the plane without too many problems."" Police have released descriptions of the girls:  :: Shamima Begum, 15 Shamima is around 5ft 7in tall and was wearing black, thick-rimmed glasses, a black hijab, a light brown and black leopard-print scarf, a dark red jumper, black trousers and jacket. She was carrying a dark blue cylindrical holdall with white straps. She is a British national of Bangladeshi heritage and speaks English with a London accent. She also speaks Bengali. :: Kadiza Sultana, 16 Kadiza is described as 5ft 6in tall and slim, and was wearing black-rimmed glasses, a long black jacket with a hood, grey striped scarf, grey jumper, dark red trousers and was carrying a black holdall. She is a British national of Bangladeshi heritage and speaks English with a London accent. She also speaks Bengali. :: Third Missing Girl, 15 The third girl, who is not being named, is German but living in London. She is described as 5ft 6in tall and slim.

Sergeant Kerry Lawrence's head was repeatedly banged on the ground by a handcuffed suspect during the assault in Basingstoke, Hampshire. It happened in the early hours of 6 July last year when she was responding to a report of a burglary in progress. The video released by her force showed her attacker, Craig Radbourne, apparently drunk, in handcuffs and protesting in a squad car before he lashes out. Craig Radbourne launches his assault on the officer An unknown man is then heard calling the emergency services, saying: ""We need police, ambulance, everything. Your officer is down, she's on the floor."" The man tried to reassure the officer and she appealed on her radio for colleagues to ""hurry up"". Back-up is heard arriving minutes later. Radbourne, 25, of Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, pleaded guilty to a charge of assault causing actual bodily harm. He was sentenced at Winchester Crown Court to three years in prison. The video was described by Judge Susan Evans QC as ""nothing short of sickening"" and she added the officer was fortunate not to be more seriously hurt. A police mugshot of Radbourne, whose attack was described as 'disgusting' She is now back at work on full duties. A Hampshire police spokeswoman said: ""Radbourne was arrested by the officer on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly. He had been placed in handcuffs and into a police car before additional units arrived. ""However, before officers arrived, Radbourne managed to strike out at Sgt Lawrence, viciously attacking her and banging her head on the ground several times. ""He was subsequently re-arrested by other officers nearby and taken into police custody."" Chief Inspector Simon Dodds said: ""This was a disgusting attack on a member of my team, who works tirelessly to serve her community."" Simon Hayes, police and crime commissioner for Hampshire, criticised the sentence as being lenient. He said: ""I am disappointed that Mr Radbourne has only been sentenced to three years in prison for the extremely violent assault against Sgt Kerry Lawrence. I would hope that he is made to serve the full sentence."""

The High Court in Belfast concluded that information published by Joseph McCloskey on a page hosted by Facebook in Ireland ""harmed the public interest, creating the risk of reoffending"". In 2007, the plaintiff, named only as CG, was convicted of gross indecency and indecent assault against a young girl and a teenage boy. He was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment but released on licence in 2012. CG had sought damages and an injunction on the grounds that Mr McCloskey and Facebook had misused private information and were in breach of Articles 2, 3 and 8 of the European Court of Human Rights and therefore, guilty of actionable negligence. Mr Justice Stephens held that both the host and operator of the page were liable for misusing private information and ordered the termination of the ""Keeping our Kids Safe from Predators 2"" profile on the social media site. He ruled that information published indiscriminately could have threatened public order and incited violence and hatred, adding: ""It was an attempt to hunt a sex offender, drive him from his home and to expose him to vilification."" The verdict at Belfast High Court could pave the way for similar cases Mr McCloskey told the court he had ""named and shamed"" 400 sex offenders through the page, but denied being responsible for a witch-hunt or hate campaign, stressing that he included a disclaimer opposing violence and intimidation. But the judge said other internet comments had provided an insight into Mr McCloskey's attitude and purpose. In one, he stated: ""Instead of Hunger Games, it should be Paedophile Games, we could hunt them down on live TV and slaughter them."" The judge made an injunction against Mr McCloskey, preventing him from harassing, pestering, annoying or molesting CG - whether by publishing, distributing, broadcasting or transmitting any information on Facebook or otherwise. He awarded £20,000 damages to CG - £15,000 against Facebook and Mr McCloskey in respect of his postings, and £5,000 against Facebook in relation to postings by the father of one of CG's victims, who maintained a separate page. Lawyers for the sex offender who issued the proceedings predicted the landmark verdict could pave the way for compensation claims by others who feel similarly aggrieved. Outside the court, CG's lawyer, Kevin Winters, claimed the judgment represented the first privacy finding worldwide in relation to third-party disclosure by Facebook members."

Footage released by the organisation showed the dog wandering loose before apparently sitting placidly by a kerb. The man can be seen on the video reaching down to put a lead on its collar before he carried out the attack. Inspectors do not know the dog's breed, but they believe it is a bull-type with white markings on the front leg and chest. The attack happened in Jex Road, Norwich, at about 1.30pm on 9 February. Laura Sayer, from the RSPCA, said: ""You can clearly see the dog being punched in the head with some considerable force, several times. ""The dog shows clear signs of fear and we are very concerned about his or her welfare."" Anyone with information should contact the RSPCA on 0300 123 8018."

They said they told their friend that they were going to go bird watching to lure her into the Wisconsin woods. ""People who trust you become very gullible,"" one of the girls told a police investigator in video obtained by local station WISN-TV. The girls said they had made a pact with the fictional character ""It was sort of sad,"" the girl added. ""We knew it was going to be at my birthday sleepover. You have no idea how difficult it was not to tell anyone,"" one of the suspects said at one point. The victim, Peyton Leutner, was stabbed 19 times last May in a wooded area of a park in Waukesha, a community about 20 miles west of Milwaukee. ""We told her we were going to get help, but we really weren't. We were going to run and let her pass away. So, we ran,"" one girl explained to a detective. Peyton crawled to a path near the woods after her attackers left. The girl, who was 12 like her attackers at the time of the stabbing, has recovered and is back in school. One of the girls in court last June Both suspects described the character Slender Man during their interrogations. ""He has tendrils that are very sharp,"" one girl said. ""I see him in my dreams."" One said that they had made a pact with the character and that he would kill them and their families if they did not carry out the stabbing. The two girls are charged in adult court with party to attempted first-degree intentional homicide. They each could face up to 65 years in the state prison system if convicted. Their attorneys want their cases moved to children's court where a conviction could send them to a secure facility until age 25. Waukesha County Circuit Judge Michael Bohren said he intends to issue a ruling in the case on 13 March. Evidence presented in court this week included one of the girl's mutilated Barbie dolls and a notebook where she wrote in one of the pages: ""He still sees you."" Many US news outlets are refraining from identifying the girls in case they end up in juvenile court."

2015-02-22,Police have released images of three men - believed to be Chelsea fans - who they want to speak to after a black man faced racist abuse on the Paris Metro.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150222035127/http://news.sky.com/story/1431337/trio-wanted-after-chelsea-fans-racist-abuse,"Police have released images of three men - believed to be Chelsea fans - who they want to speak to after a black man faced racist abuse on the Paris Metro. Officers think the men were among a group filmed pushing the victim, Sylla Souleymane, off the train and chanting a racist song while on the way to a Champions League match against Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday. The images were made public by Scotland Yard, who are aiding the French authorities with their investigation, as reports emerged that French President Francois Hollande had spoken to Mr Souleymane on the phone. Mr Hollande praised the 33-year-old and thanked him for the dignity he has shown in his public remarks over the incident, according to Le Parisien newspaper. Mr Souleymane told the paper the fans who abused him should be jailed. ""These people, these English fans, must be found, punished and must be locked up,"" he said. ""What happened should not go unpunished."" Meanwhile, Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho said the club was ""ashamed"" of those supporters who pushed Mr Souleymane amid chants of ""We're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it"". He said: ""I'd like to make clear, on behalf of everyone at the club, our disgust at the incident. We were appalled by what we saw."" The club has suspended another two people from Stamford Bridge, bringing the total to five. Chelsea said it had received ""substantial information"" following an appeal for witnesses and an investigation was ongoing. Officials have also invited Mr Souleymane and his family to London to attend the second leg of the European clash against PSG on 11 March. Anyone with information should call police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
2015-02-22,David Cameron has set out his reasons to vote Conservative in Scotland - saying a vote for either Labour or the Scottish Nationalist Party will mean a Labour-SNP coalition.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150222035127/http://news.sky.com/story/1431201/pm-warns-of-labour-snp-nightmare-scenario,"David Cameron has set out his reasons to vote Conservative in Scotland - saying a vote for either Labour or the Scottish Nationalist Party will mean a Labour-SNP coalition. The Prime Minister was speaking at the conference of the Scottish Conservative Party in Edinburgh where he thanked party workers for helping to keep the UK together. Tory activists were among those supporting the successful 'No' campaign in the Scottish independence referendum in September. But, he said, the battle was not over. ""Friends - a major risk to Scotland's future remains. Miliband and Balls,"" he said, referring to the leader of the Labour Party and the shadow Chancellor. ""If you thought the ultimate nightmare scenario was a Labour Government? Try this: Labour and the SNP in Government. ""A unique, unprecedented coalition of the people who would break up our country and the people who would bankrupt our country. ""The only people who can stop them are us."" His comments came after the latest opinion polls in Scotland put the SNP between 10 and 28 percentage point ahead of Labour in second place. The Tories trailed a distant third. But analysis by Sky based on national projections in January had the SNP winning 53 seats in May's General Election with Labour on 282 - 44 seats short of an overall majority. Mr Cameron said: ""A vote for the SNP is a vote for Labour in Government. Nicola Sturgeon has made clear she is up for a coalition with Ed Miliband. ""So if you vote for anyone else apart from the Conservatives, you are voting for this outcome: Labour in Government. ""Ed Miliband in Downing Street and the very real prospect of Alex Salmond coming in through the back door."" Labour's shadow Scottish secretary Margaret Curran said: ""David Cameron dreams of more SNP MPs than even Nicola Sturgeon does. He knows that every vote for the SNP makes it more likely he can hang on in Downing Street."" Sky's Deputy Political Editor Joey Jones, who has been a tour of the marginals that could prove key to the May result, said Mr Cameron has an uphill battle to convince Scots to back him. On a visit to the ""genteel and affluent"" seat of Perth, he found the Conservatives had a lot of work to do. He said: ""If it were south of the border, Perth would be a dead-cert, true blue Tory seat. ""In the aftermath of the Scottish referendum, this was the sort of constituency Tories dared to dream might come their way. ""The problem for the Tories was evident, though. It is clear ... that the 'Tory bounce' many hoped for in the wake of the referendum campaign ... is, at this stage, proving elusive."""
2015-02-22,The high street fashion retailer New Look has recruited bankers to work on a stock market listing that could value it at as much as £2bn.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150222035127/http://news.sky.com/story/1431299/new-look-fashions-plans-for-2bn-flotation,"By Mark Kleinman, City Editor The high street fashion retailer New Look has recruited bankers to work on a stock market listing that could value it at as much as £2bn. Sky News has learnt that the company this week appointed JP Morgan, the Wall Street investment bank, to work on options for a flotation. The hiring will fuel expectations that New Look's owners are actively preparing to take it public five years after it aborted an identical move amid challenging markets. JP Morgan is working alongside Goldman Sachs, which is working with New Look to identify other potential investors for the company. The chain, which trades from more than 800 stores in 21 countries around the world, is the UK's second-biggest women's value clothing and accessories retailer, according to Kantar Worldpanel, a research firm. New Look has been owned since 2004 by Apax and Permira, two private equity firms, along with Tom Singh, its founder. According to third-quarter financial results released last week, New Look saw like-for-like sales in the UK declined by 1%, a dip that it attributed to unseasonably warm weather. The company is continuing to expand internationally, as well as attempting to grow its menswear business. It now has nearly 20 shops in China although it retreated from Russia and Ukraine because of continuing instability in the two countries. Anders Kristiansen, its chief executive, described New Look's trading performance as ""robust...against a challenging backdrop"". ""It was a record online sales performance over the Christmas period with all channels well-prepared for peaks in demand around Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Boxing Day, whilst our high street presence came into its own as we handled a surge in demand for our Click & Collect and Order in Store offerings,"" he said. Mr Kristiansen said last week that New Look was a company ""ready to float"" although he added that a decision to do so rested with the chain's owners. New Look's examination of a stock market listing makes it one of several well-known companies looking at such a move. Sky News revealed earlier this week that Center Parcs had hired bankers to work on a flotation which would value it at about £2.5bn. New Look declined to comment."
2015-02-22,Chancellor George Osborne and London Mayor Boris Johnson have launched a government plan to put £10bn into London's transport infrastructure.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150222035127/http://news.sky.com/story/1431043/more-24-hour-rail-part-of-10bn-london-plan,"Chancellor George Osborne and London Mayor Boris Johnson have launched a government plan to put £10bn into London's transport infrastructure. Mr Johnson promised more 24-hour rail services in the capital where the first round of overnight Tube services are due to get under way soon. The proposals are part of a package of measures designed to help London stay ahead of New York and other cities in the coming years. The Government is confident that the plans will create half a million jobs by 2020 and add £6.4bn to the capital's economy by 2030. Chancellor George Osborne and mayor Boris Johnson said 24-hour services would be expanded on the Tube and extended to London Overground and the Docklands Light Railway. During an early-morning visit to view maintenance work, they outlined a six-point plan that also extended wi-fi on the Tube. Night-time Tube services will be expanded to the Metropolitan, Circle, District, and Hammersmith and City lines once Transport for London's modernisation programmes are completed. Currently 24-hour services will begin on the Northern, Victoria, Piccadilly, Jubilee and Central lines from September. Rail unions described the announcement as a ""blatant pre-election stunt"" and questioned how the figure of £6.4 billion had been worked out. The £10bn of funding covers investment in new TfL infrastructure over the next parliament, including the Tube improvements, better roads, more buses and cycle lanes. It is designed to cope with growth that will mean London's population is expected to top 10 million by the early 2030s. Appearing at the Tate Modern art gallery on Friday morning for the official launch, Mr Osborne said: ""This is our long-term economic plan for London. To grow our city and outpace New York. ""To create over half a million new jobs, build over 400,000 new homes, provide £10bn on new transport, back business and science and culture here, give a voice to people here and make London the greatest capital city on earth for the next generation of Londoners."" Mick Cash, leader of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union, said: ""This announcement has been dropped on London by the mayor as a blatant pre-election stunt without a shred of consultation with the union. ""RMT is not opposed to extended running but there are massive issues on staffing, safety and maintenance which have not been addressed and which would need to be signed off by our reps. ""Night running would mean increased drunkenness and risks to both passengers and staff alike and could only work with substantial increases in staffing right across the board."""

Witnesses said the blaze appeared to have started at around 2am in the middle of the residential building, rapidly spreading from the 51st floor to the 83rd floor. In several videos posted on social media websites, multiple floors of the 676-apartment high-rise were seen ablaze. Strong winds fanned the flames and burning debris from the fire could be seen falling from building. One witness said flames shot out from two sides of the building as glass and metal rained down from near the summit of the structure. Footage shows the fire sweeping through the upper floors. Pic: Jaime Muller Another witness said it looked ""like the Titanic going down"", according to Gulfnews.com. One resident, Briton Steve Short, 53, from Liverpool, praised the work of firefighters who arrived quickly. He said fire alarms alerted people to the blaze and building management sent workers knocking on doors to ensure residents got out. Residents of at least one neighbouring tower were told to evacuate as a precaution because of high winds, but they were later allowed back inside. It took firefighters several hours before they extinguished the blaze, according to a witness at the scene. Hundreds of Torch Tower residents were evacuated. Pic: Jaime Muller The cause of the fire was not immediately clear. Officials said there were no reports of casualties. Expert General. Rashid Thani Al Matrooshi, director general of Dubai Civil Defense, said the winds had blown the flames further, making it difficult to fight the fire.  But he added that ""speed, accuracy and response to the condition change"" had seen fire crews able to take control of the blaze. Opened in 2011, the Torch Tower has 87 floors and is one of the world's tallest residential buildings. It is located in the Marina district of the city which is home to dozens of towering apartment blocks and hotels, many of them built over the past decade. The apartments are popular with Dubai's large number of expatriate professionals. Dubai, known for its skyline of hugely varied skyscrapers, has seen fires at towers in the past. In 2012, a huge blaze gutted the 34-Tamweel tower in the nearby Jumeirah Lake Towers district. It was later revealed to have been caused by a cigarette butt thrown into a bin."
2015-02-22,A top musician and conductor has been jailed for 11 years for sex assaults on his teenage students.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150222035127/http://news.sky.com/story/1430963/music-teacher-jailed-for-sex-attacks-on-girls,"By Martin Brunt, Crime Correspondent A top musician and conductor has been jailed for 11 years for sex assaults on his teenage students. Philip Pickett used soundproofed music practice rooms to rape and indecently assault pupils who idolised him. When one victim's parents complained to the prestigious Guildhall School of Music and Drama, its principal took months to reply, took no action and suggested the girl take lessons elsewhere. Pickett was allowed to continue his celebrated career as a leading authority on baroque music, touring abroad and playing concerts with some of the world's top performers. Pickett was arrested two years ago over assaults in the '70s and '80s He became a musical director at London's Globe theatre on the South Bank and founded the New London Consort ensemble. The 64-year-old was finally arrested when one victim reported him to police two years ago in the wake of publicity around the Jimmy Savile scandal. He denied a string of charges from the 1970s and '80s involving sex attacks against young female students. Pickett, one of the world's leading woodwind instrumentalists, was convicted of two rapes and two indecent assaults on three pupils. He was cleared of six alleged attacks on four others. Judge Charles Wide described his crimes as ""terrible"". ""You were their teacher,"" he said. ""To a degree they were in awe of you, especially the schoolgirls. ""There is the location of the offences, the practice rooms of the Guildhall School of Music, soundproofed and dark. Even if they had shouted they could not have been heard."" One victim, who was 16 at the time, told the Old Bailey jury that during a music lesson in 1978 he demanded she take off her top ""to work on your breathing"" and then molested her. At her next lesson he raped her. She did not report him at the time, but told her mother she did not want any more lessons. In 1984, another victim told her parents of an assault and they wrote to the school asking for an explanation. But the then principal John Hosier took months to reply and eventually told them he had received no other complaints, advising their daughter to find lessons at another school. Mr Hosier, who is now dead, wrote to Pickett saying he was frustrated that the tutor had not contacted him to discuss the allegation, according to documents discovered by the City of London police. Det Supt Maria Woodall said: ""Philip Pickett used his position of authority as an accomplished professor to abuse young talented women who were vulnerable due to their age and the fact they were pupils of his. ""He knew how difficult it would be for them to report his crimes to the school or to the police. ""His access to young women over such a period of time means there could be more victims who have yet to come forward. ""I would urge these people to contact the City of London Police."" Among former students of the Guildhall School of Music and Drama are Beatles producer Sir George Martin, the flautist Sir James Galway and the opera singer Bryn Terfel. The school said in a statement: ""Although these events took place several decades ago, this does not diminish our utter shock that a professional music teacher could abuse the trust placed in him by the school and its students. ""The Guildhall School wholeheartedly welcomes the verdicts. Justice has been done and our thoughts are with the victims of these dreadful crimes. ""The Guildhall School takes the duty of care of its students extremely seriously. Robust safeguarding procedures are in place at the school to ensure safe learning environments for all students and these measures are regularly reviewed."" Pickett lived with his wife in the pretty Cotswold village of Lyneham near Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire. He tried to delay his sentence so he could attend music festivals abroad. He was jailed last week, but a reporting ban was imposed until today when the Crown Prosecution Service decided to drop more charges against him."

The boy, Elijah Marsh, had wandered away from an apartment building in Toronto into a bitterly cold night. Family members said they had last seen him in his bed on Wednesday night and that they woke in the early hours of Thursday to find him gone and the front door open. An online campaign is raising funds for the boy's funeral He was filmed by a security camera in the lobby of his grandmother's apartment building in the Canadian city, wearing only a nappy, T-shirt and boots as he walked outside, where the temperature hovered at -4F (-20C). A massive search, covered on live TV, got under way with hundreds of police officers and residents taking part. Elijah was found six hours later in a nearby yard. He did not show any vital signs, and was rushed to the hospital but died. The story touched the city, with people sharing their grief on Twitter and many donating to an online bid to help the family cover the cost of the funeral. The fundraising campaign had reached CAN$95,000 (£50,000) by Friday. ""It really is a tragic set of circumstances,"" Toronto police chief Bill Blair said. ""I think every Torontonian will feel the loss. ""I think it'll remind all of us to go home and just hug our kids a little bit more. And I think we all will grieve for that child and for their family and for their community for its loss."""
2015-02-22,A care home worker has admitted trying to murder three colleagues at a sheltered housing complex by poisoning them.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150222035127/http://news.sky.com/story/1431001/care-worker-admits-trying-to-murder-colleagues,"By Lisa Dowd, Midlands Correspondent A care home worker has admitted trying to murder three colleagues at a sheltered housing complex by poisoning them. Melissa Swift, 23, who had also worked as a special constable with West Midlands Police, laced drinks that everyone at the care unit had access to with bleach. She wept at Birmingham Crown Court as she also pleaded guilty to threatening to kill her estranged sister and another care home colleague. In August last year, 32 residents and staff were taken ill with food poisoning at the Goldfield Court complex, in West Bromwich, with symptoms including nausea, diarrhoea and severe headaches. One person who suffered stroke-like symptoms has since made a full recovery. Detective Chief Inspector Michaela Kerr said: ""Melissa deceived her colleagues and hatched a plan to cause ill to those she worked with as a result of some malice, for which we have never truly discovered the cause. ""She not only thought out a way of poisoning her work mates but also followed the plan through and administered bleach to their drinks, leaving them in the usual staff fridge where she knew they would go. ""The plan was dangerous, reckless and hugely alarming. ""There is nothing to have stopped anyone from consuming the drinks she tampered with and, given the nature of her profession and workplace as a care provider, she went against everything her dedicated colleagues worked for. ""Thankfully no one was seriously injured as a result of what she did, but the story could so easily have been different."" Police said Swift had sent anonymous threats in letters smeared with blood to her sister and a colleague. A short time before her arrest, she left her role as a special constable. She has been remanded in custody and will be sentenced in April."
2015-02-22,The chief executives of Britain's biggest high street banks will be handed more than £3m in annual bonuses for 2014 but will see their payouts curbed after another year in which their employers faced heavy regulatory fines.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150222035127/http://news.sky.com/story/1431171/uk-bank-bosses-land-3m-in-annual-bonuses,"By Mark Kleinman, City Editor The chief executives of Britain's biggest high street banks will be handed more than £3m in annual bonuses for 2014 but will see their payouts curbed after another year in which their employers faced heavy regulatory fines. Sky News can exclusively reveal that the boardroom pay committees at Barclays, HSBC and Lloyds Banking Group are finalising the bonus awards, which will be announced alongside the lenders' annual results during the next ten days. News of the payouts, which will include a £1.3m bonus for Stuart Gulliver, the chief executive of HSBC, will come just weeks before the General Election campaign gets under way. Insiders said that Mr Gulliver's bonus had been cut from last year's £1.83m, with a substantial proportion of the reduction attributable to the £216m fine from the City watchdog for control failings in HSBC's foreign exchange operations. Mr Gulliver was paid a basic salary of £1.25m and a ""role-based allowance"" worth £1.7m introduced to mitigate the impact of new European pay rules in 2014. In total, he was awarded a remuneration package in 2014 of about £7.4m including pension contributions and other benefits, HSBC’s annual report will disclose on Monday. Mr Gulliver made a public apology last weekend over the re-emergence of a tax evasion scandal at HSBC's Swiss private banking arm and is focused on cleaning up the affair, which dates back a decade, according to one insider. His annual bonus is expected to be the largest paid to a UK bank chief executive for 2014. Sky News understands that the Barclays boss Antony Jenkins will receive an annual bonus of approximately £1m, roughly 50% of his maximum entitlement. A bank insider pointed out that during 2014, Barclays improved its capital and leverage positions - both measures of its financial soundness - while removing £1.7bn from the bank's cost-base, sending sent its shares up by around a third over the last year. Mr Jenkins is expected to accept the award, the first time he has done so since taking over as chief executive in 2012, taking his total pay for 2014 to in the region of £5m. City analysts are forecasting that Barclays' profits will be higher than in 2013, while as Sky News reported earlier this week, the bank’s overall bonus pool will fall from just under £2.4bn to less than £2bn. At Lloyds, Antonio Horta-Osorio's annual bonus will be just under £1m, according to an insider. The figure would have been higher based on Lloyds' performance but was cut to reflect the bank's £220m fine for its role in the Libor rate-rigging scandal, a source said. Mr Horta-Osorio, who was recruited by the Treasury in 2011 to run bailed-out Lloyds, is also in line for a long-term share award dating back three years that would be worth around £7m. Lloyds hopes to announce next week that it has gained permission to pay a dividend to shareholders for the first time since the banking crisis. The chief executives' annual bonuses account for only part of their overall remuneration packages. Under reforms introduced by the European Banking Authority (EBA) last year, material risk-takers in banks now have their variable pay capped at 100% of their fixed pay, or twice that sum if shareholders have explicitly approved the move. Investors in Barclays, HSBC and Lloyds have all approved the higher threshold, while RBS fought an unsuccessful private battle with the Treasury which culminated with it only being able to pay out bonuses equivalent to an employee's salary. The new rules have led to almost all major banks operating in Europe, including the big four UK institutions, introducing 'role-based allowances' to contend with the European cap. These count towards fixed pay but can be adjusted on an annual or in some more cases more frequent basis, leading to a review by the EBA which may announce further restrictions on their payment in the coming weeks. Mr Jenkins' allowance is £950,000, which gives him aggregate fixed pay of £2.05m, while  at Lloyds, Mr Horta-Osorio is paid a £900,000 allowance on top of his £1.061m salary. The figures are clouded by the changing value of bank shares, which means that long-term awards made three years ago can be worth markedly more or less than they were at the point of their allocation. The exception to the structure of the bank chiefs’ pay deals will be Ross McEwan, who runs Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS). He is paid a £1m salary and from this year will receive a £1m role-based allowance, but is not entitled to an annual bonus following a decision by the taxpayer-backed lender to cease making such payments in order to minimise the prospect of a yearly public row over his remuneration. Mr McEwan is, however, eligible for long-term share awards equivalent to the sum of his fixed pay. None of the banks would comment ahead of the publication of their financial results or remuneration figures."

Now we have to think about the calls we make and the texts we send on our mobile phones. GCHQ has hacked into a SIM card maker Another revelation - this one from The Intercept - and another new level of intrusion. GCHQ and the NSA hacked into Gemalto, the largest SIM card maker in the world and stole encryption keys. 3G and 4G calls are quite well protected by encryption. But anyone with a key can listen in - and that now includes the security services. Given all that's been alleged by Snowden (some of which has been officially confirmed by the NSA and GCHQ, some of which has not), how serious is this latest threat? In terms of mass surveillance, this is unlikely to be on as big a scale. Listening in on hours of phone calls is a lot more work than scanning emails and other online communications by keyword. But there are two important things. First, this shows the security services breaking into a foreign company's systems to steal personal information that was designed to remained secure. That feels much more aggressive than dipping into internet traffic as it flows by. Second, even if fewer people are affected by this type of surveillance, it's a lot more personal. We've always tended to assume that internet communications are monitored - probably because this is the deal we make with companies like Google and Facebook. But we expect our private phone calls to be just that: private. No one thinks that mobile networks monitor calls in the same way broadband providers monitor internet traffic. What we have is a familiarly disturbing scenario: spies literally listening in, eavesdropping, on personal conversation. The response to Snowden's documents has been fairly muted in the UK. This could provoke a more visceral reaction."

The 26-year-old is due to appear at Hendon Magistrates' Court in north London today. A post-mortem examination on the six-month-old infant, who died on 26 January, found that a head injury was the cause of death. The child was not responsive when police and paramedics were called to a property in Tottenham, north London, on 23 January. The baby was first taken to North Middlesex Hospital before being transferred to Great Ormond Street Hospital. Police arrested a 30-year-old woman on suspicion of grievous bodily harm, but she has since been released with no further action. Identities of the people involved are not being released by police."

The same could have been said of David Cameron's whirlwind visit to the Scottish Tory conference in Edinburgh. He breezed in - late - after a visit to a shipyard in Glasgow, read a 20-minute speech from autocue and was gone. After arriving on stage well after 2pm, he was out of Edinburgh's International Conference Centre before 3pm, in a rush - according to Downing Street insiders - because he had an appointment at Chequers at 5.15pm. The tartan Tory faithful didn't mind, however. They gave the Prime Minister a standing ovation before and after his speech, applauded loudly during it, and laughed at his jokes. And, to be fair, he used humour with some aplomb to deliver his main message to his Scottish audience: a warning that a vote for the Scottish National Party at the General Election would hand power to Ed Miliband and Alex Salmond. ""And if you thought the ultimate nightmare scenario was a Labour Government, try this: Labour and the SNP in Government,"" he said. A vote for the SNP was a vote for Labour in Government, he claimed. He went on: ""The SNP and Labour are halfway up the aisle together already. They've picked out the wedding list. They've booked the honeymoon - probably to North Korea."" The audience chuckled at that line. A vote for anyone else apart from the Conservatives was a vote for Mr Miliband in Downing Street and the prospect of Alex Salmond coming in through the back door, said Mr Cameron. ""Like a horror movie - he's back,"" he said, clearly enjoying this bit of his speech. ""Only this time - he's not running Scotland..."" Then the PM's humour quickly turned to anger as he adopted the ""Flashman"" bullying tone he often uses at Prime Minister's Questions. He condemned Labour for refusing to rule out a deal with the SNP with the words: ""Spineless. Weak. Unprincipled. Short-termist. That, my friends, is all anyone needs to know about today's Labour party."" Mr Cameron also won big applause when he referred to the Royal Navy frigate order for the Clyde announced earlier. These frigates featured prominently in last year's referendum campaign, with senior Tories claiming they wouldn't be built in Scotland in the event of a Yes vote.  So what are we to make of these Conservative warnings about a Labour-SNP coalition? Earlier this week Labour's shadow Scotland secretary Margaret Curran claimed: ""We know David Cameron is actually secretly pleased with the prospects of Scottish people voting SNP because he knows that's his best chance of being in power."" Who's right, Conservatives or Labour? They can't both be. We didn't get a chance to ask the PM if his warning was a double bluff, however. Because the car engine was running."

The rural town of Harlan has been covered by more than a foot of snow - with more bad weather expected. And local officers have now issued a joke warrant for the heroine from the hit kids' movie. A message on the police department's Facebook page said: ""Suspect is a blonde female last seen wearing a long blue dress and is known to burst into song 'Let it Go!' ""As you can see by the weather she is very dangerous."" Another message was later posted telling residents that, all joking aside, they should take the weather seriously and be careful."

The RAC Foundation claims ""fines"" of up to £100 for infringing conditions in private car parks may be illegal, and is calling on the Government to stop the practice. Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: ""Millions of drivers could be in line for a refund. We estimate that in 2013 alone, drivers might have been overcharged by some £100m."" Clamping on private land was outlawed by the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012, but charges for infringements of private car park conditions have grown to an estimated £100m per year. Barrister John de Waal QC argues that this is likely to be several times more than compensation for a genuine loss, and would not be enforceable by the courts. ""They should be seen by the courts as penalties, which means they are unenforceable,"" he said. Pauline Welsh, 57, was charged £60 after parking on what she thought was council-owned land - meaning it would have been free during the evening. ""It's shocking, and it needs sorting,"" the retired teacher told Sky News. ""It's just not fair."" Mrs Welsh's husband, Alastair, appealed against her ticket - and another incurred by their son elsewhere. Both were overturned. Figures from the British Parking Association show motorists won 49% of the 57,500 appeals made every year on average. Professor Glaister called on the Government to set out what a reasonable charge should be. ""They allowed a system of ticketing to emerge which is barely regulated. In effect, drivers have been short-changed,"" he added."

Calls made on the 3G and 4G networks are encrypted - but by stealing the keys, intelligence agencies were able to monitor mobile phone communications without the permission or knowledge of customers, phone companies and foreign governments. The UK intelligence agency Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) teamed up with the US' National Security Agency (NSA) to target Dutch SIM card manufacturer Gemalto. Gemalto manufactures around two billion SIM cards every year The company creates around two billion SIM cards annually for 450 wireless networks around the world. It is believed that employees of Gemalto had their emails penetrated after being contacted via Facebook. In one GCQH slide cited by The Intercept, the agency said it had access to Gemalto's ""entire network"". A spokesman for Gemalto said the firm will ""devote all resources necessary"" to understand the ""sophisticated techniques"" used to get the SIM card data. The breach was revealed in documents handed to The Intercept, a website edited by Glenn Greenwald and owned eBay founder Pierre Omidyar. The GCHQ document cited - dated 2010 - states that the operation allowed it and the NSA to monitor phone activity without leaving a trace. Gaining decryption keys also meant that previously uncrackable information held by the agencies could be understood. GCHQ said it does not comment on intelligence matters, but said all of its work is legal."

Several MI5 agents are due to give evidence in the coming days in the trial of Abid Naseer, a Pakistani student accused of plotting bomb attacks on the Arndale Centre in Manchester, the New York subway and targets in Copenhagen. The agents will be identified only by number, and will appear in ""light disguise"", expected to include make-up and in some cases wigs, in an attempt to protect their identities while allowing the jury to gauge their facial expressions. The intervention from the unnamed British official came as US District Judge Raymond Dearie considered a prosecution request that the agents' faces should not be drawn accurately by court artists. After hearing representations from US and British media present, the judge was briefed in private by the British government official, and representatives of the prosecution. Addressing the court afterwards, Judge Dearie said: ""The situation is grave. ""This is a serious matter on all sides, and more specific demonstrations of that have been brought home to me by a representative of the British government."" Referring to the MI5 officers he said: ""These are committed lifelong undercover operatives, not people who do a couple of months and then go back on the rank."" At the judge's request the court artists present agreed to draw only ""generic"" representations of the faces and hair of the witnesses. The MI5 agents are expected to detail surveillance of Naseer carried out when he was under investigation in the UK, and alleged to be plotting the attacks. The court has already heard from a number of Greater Manchester Police officers, who conducted the initial investigation into Naseer. They have told the court that a note recovered from one of his computers apparently referring to his impending wedding was in fact a coded message indicating an imminent attack. Naseer, 28, was extradited in 2013 and pleads not guilty to charges he was part of a broader al Qaeda conspiracy that included the Manchester plot and one against New York City. He is representing himself in court, and is flanked by two or more security officials at all times, including when he approaches the judge's bench for legal argument. Two other witnesses expected to testify against Naseer - Najibullah Zazi and Zarein Ahmedzay - have pleaded guilty to plotting to detonate homemade explosives in the New York subways. Prosecutors claim that email account evidence shows all three men were under the direction of the same al Qaeda handler, and that documents recovered in the raid on Osama bin Laden's compound in Pakistan, confirm the terror network’s leadership was behind the conspiracy."

The Guardian claimed CEO Stuart Gulliver - who announced the bank's full-year results this morning - kept $7.6m (£4.93m) via an account held by a Panamanian company. During an exchange in the House of Commons on Monday afternoon, shadow chancellor Mr Balls attacked George Osborne over the Government's record on HSBC. He asked a series of questions to find out why it appointed HSBC's ex-chairman Lord Green to be a trade minister, after HM Revenue and Customs had already been made aware of cash held in the bank's Swiss subsidiary.  Mr Ball told the Commons: ""It is not good enough for this Chancellor to shout and bluster and try to sweep ... questions under the carpet and claim he didn't ask these questions. ""He has been the chancellor for five years since the government was given the files. ""Isn't it clear that either he and the Prime Minister were negligent in failing to act on the evidence ... about HSBC and Lord Green or ... didn't they just deliberately turn a blind eye?"" It prompted Mr Osborne to respond: ""The whole house can see that the person bringing this question to the house is the person with the most to answer for. ""Every single one of these alleged offences occurred when he was the principal tax adviser to the last Labour government."" Lord Green, who was chairman of HSBC from 2006 to 2010, was under considerable pressure to answer questions about the behaviour of the bank's Swiss division before he stepped down from financial services body TheCityUK's Advisory Council on 14 February. Leaked files detailed in The Guardian reportedly showed that in 2007 the bank's current chief executive Mr Gulliver was the beneficial owner of an account held by Worcester Equities Inc, though Mr Gulliver has insisted no tax was dodged in any jurisdiction. He explained it was set up in the name of the Panama-based company to prevent HSBC staff in Hong Kong and Switzerland from knowing how much he was paid in the 1990s. The account has since been closed as his pay is now disclosed to shareholders. The disclosure was made amid the ongoing scandal over claims HSBC's Swiss private banking arm helped wealthy clients evade and avoid tax, and provided services to criminals including arms dealers. Derby-born Mr Gulliver has now spoken to journalists of the ""shame"" felt by staff, having apologised for the behaviour of the Swiss division in national newspaper advertisements last week. He insisted the private bank had been ""completely overhauled"" since 2007, when whistleblower Herve Falciani opened the door to the scandal, stealing company data and passing it to French authorities. Swiss prosecutors have launched a criminal investigation into allegations of money laundering after raiding the bank's offices in Geneva. The 55-year-old - who received a £7.3m reward package last year - is legally domiciled in Hong Kong after working there for many years, despite now working in the UK. Representatives for the banking boss told The Guardian he had paid his bonus payments into HSBC Suisse until 2003. They said Hong Kong tax had been paid and that Mr Gulliver had also told the UK taxman about the account a ""number of years"" ago. MPs are set to grill HMRC tax officials on Wednesday over accusations they failed to act properly on the leaked files and potential evidence of tax evasion by more than 3,000 Britons."

Richard Barklie, who was one of three men police sought after a black man was allegedly pushed off the train by chanting football supporters, has insisted he is not a racist. Video posted online showed commuter Souleymane Sylla being pushed back onto the platform as some of those on the train chanted ""we're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it"". Mr Barklie, 50, who was a member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and a Police Service of Northern Ireland officer, is currently a director of the World Human Rights Forum. The Chelsea season ticket holder issued a statement through his solicitor Kevin Winters, in which he admitted being involved in an ""incident"" that resulted in Mr Sylla being ""unable to enter part of the train"". In the statement, Mr Winters said: ""Pending formal engagement with police, our client is anxious to put on record his total abhorrence for racism and any activity associated with it. ""As someone who has spent years working with disadvantaged communities in Africa and India he can point to a CV in human rights work, which undermines any suggestion he is racist. ""Today a senior official in the World Human Rights Forum confirmed their support for him. ""He did not participate in racist chanting and singing and condemns any behaviour supporting that."" Mr Winters says Mr Barklie had travelled to matches for more than 20 years with no problems and has ""an account to give to police which will explain the context and circumstances"" of this incident. ""In the meantime pending that, he wants to put on record his sincerest apologies for the trauma and stress suffered by Mr Souleymane."" The WAVE Trauma Centre, which supports victims of the Northern Ireland Troubles, said it had suspended a part-time worker pending further investigation into the Paris incident. A Metropolitan Police spokesman says the other two men in the photo have been identified and the force is working with the French authorities. None of the men sought by Scotland Yard have been arrested. Five people have so far been suspended from Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground following investigations into the incident."

Dyfed-Powys Police said: ""There is a detailed search plan in place, and we are working through that meticulously. ""The start and end times of the search operation each day depends on tide times and water levels, as well as the overall weather conditions.

The same could have been said of David Cameron's whirlwind visit to the Scottish Tory conference in Edinburgh. He breezed in - late - after a visit to a shipyard in Glasgow, read a 20-minute speech from autocue and was gone. After arriving on stage well after 2pm, he was out of Edinburgh's International Conference Centre before 3pm, in a rush - according to Downing Street insiders - because he had an appointment at Chequers at 5.15pm. The tartan Tory faithful didn't mind, however. They gave the Prime Minister a standing ovation before and after his speech, applauded loudly during it, and laughed at his jokes. And, to be fair, he used humour with some aplomb to deliver his main message to his Scottish audience: a warning that a vote for the Scottish National Party at the General Election would hand power to Ed Miliband and Alex Salmond. ""And if you thought the ultimate nightmare scenario was a Labour Government, try this: Labour and the SNP in Government,"" he said. A vote for the SNP was a vote for Labour in Government, he claimed. He went on: ""The SNP and Labour are halfway up the aisle together already. They've picked out the wedding list. They've booked the honeymoon - probably to North Korea."" The audience chuckled at that line. A vote for anyone else apart from the Conservatives was a vote for Mr Miliband in Downing Street and the prospect of Alex Salmond coming in through the back door, said Mr Cameron. ""Like a horror movie - he's back,"" he said, clearly enjoying this bit of his speech. ""Only this time - he's not running Scotland..."" Then the PM's humour quickly turned to anger as he adopted the ""Flashman"" bullying tone he often uses at Prime Minister's Questions. He condemned Labour for refusing to rule out a deal with the SNP with the words: ""Spineless. Weak. Unprincipled. Short-termist. That, my friends, is all anyone needs to know about today's Labour party."" Mr Cameron also won big applause when he referred to the Royal Navy frigate order for the Clyde announced earlier. These frigates featured prominently in last year's referendum campaign, with senior Tories claiming they wouldn't be built in Scotland in the event of a Yes vote.  So what are we to make of these Conservative warnings about a Labour-SNP coalition?

The 28-year-old man, whose name was only given as David, was on Helvellyn in the Lake District when the snow storm struck. He began his terrifying descent after taking a step backwards on a ridge with a 350m drop. Miraculously, he didn't fall the whole way and came to a rest about 200m down the mountain. He then managed to continue making his way to the bottom through the blizzard. His luck went even further, as nearby volunteers from Patterdale Mountain Rescue had cancelled their plans to train somewhere else because of the severe weather and happened to be waiting at the bottom. The team's leader, Mike Blakey, told Sky News: ""He came out of a cloud, collapsed at our feet and didn't say anything. ""We were quite close to our Land Rover ambulances, so we were able to package him on to a stretcher. ""He had no major injuries - but there are lots of cuts and bruises. Maybe there was lots of soft snow."" Mr Blakey has suggested that the patient should buy a lottery ticket in light of his incredibly good fortune as he only knows of one other person who has survived such an accident on the mountain. A car overturned in the blizzard on Sunday. Pic: Langdale Mountain Rescue Shortly after David's rescue, the team assisted with another emergency call to Langdale Ambleside Mountain Rescue after dozens of people were stranded by the heavy snow. Two injured people became trapped in an overturned car on the Kirkstone Pass, while coach carrying 24 Chinese tourists also had to be evacuated. A yellow ""be aware"" warning for heavy snowfall across the region has been enforced by the Met Office.  Three people have died on Hellvelyn since the start of the year."

The London-listed group said reported profit before tax fell to $18.68bn (£12.14bn) in 2014. It said it was, in part, due to the ""negative effect"" of ""significant items including fines, settlements, UK customer redress and associated provisions"". The explanation reflected the continued cost on the industry of a number of scandals, including the mis-selling of payment protection insurance (PPI). HSBC's share price fell more than 5% in the wake of the results as profits fell short of expectations. Dividend and return-on-equity targets were also unexpectedly cut. The earnings report was announced just hours after HSBC's chief executive Stuart Gulliver, who has vowed to reform the bank in the wake of allegations of complicity in tax evasion at its Swiss arm, was dragged into a tax row himself. Mr Gulliver, who denies any suggestion of wrong-doing in connection with his own Swiss-based account, said he was ""disappointed"" in the group's performance last year. ""2014 was a challenging year in which we continued to work hard to improve business performance while managing the impact of a higher operating cost base,"" he said. ""Profits disappointed, although a tough fourth quarter masked some of the progress made over the preceding three quarters. ""Many of the challenging aspects of the fourth-quarter results were common to the industry as a whole."" Banks have not only been negotiating the effects of record-low interest rates but also uncertainty over the global economy. In relation to the Swiss tax scandal, HSBC chairman Douglas Flint said the bank needed to reinforce controls and demonstrate their effectiveness. He added: ""We deeply regret and apologise for the conduct and compliance failures highlighted, which were in contravention of our own policies as well as expectations of us."" The bank was also the subject of a £216m fine from the Financial Conduct Authority relating to HSBC's failure to prevent the rigging of foreign exchange operations. Mr Gulliver's total pay package for 2014 was £7.6m, though his bonus of £1.3m was weaker and reflected the foreign exchange failures which ultimately cost him £500,000 of his reward. Labour said the size of the payout would leave people ""astounded"" and called for wider reforms of the banking industry. It was due to ask an urgent question in the Commons on HSBC and bonuses."

Take the sting catching out two distinguished MPs - one Tory and one Labour. You might expect embarrassing revelations about the boastful promises of Sir Malcolm Rifkind and Jack Straw to be bad news for both of the biggest Westminster parties. And yet, Labour was first out of the blocks when it came to a response - gladly grasping hold of Mr Straw's offer of a party suspension and quickly calling for a crackdown on politicians' lucrative second jobs. To be fair to Ed Miliband, this was a policy he outlined back in 2013. It would ban MPs from taking on directorships or consultancy roles to prevent them being influenced by groups whose interests might not chime with those of constituents. Labour HQ took no time in realising that today's story - leading the news - gave them the perfect chance to restate and add to that policy. So Mr Miliband wrote to the Prime Minister to urge him to also act. The Labour leader said the idea would be in his party's manifesto and apply to all its election candidates. But he said he wanted it to go further with legislation to make it a cross-party initiative. He has also proposed a cap on second earnings - with one figure being discussed amounting to 15% of the £98,000 earned by a minister of state. Mr Miliband said he was writing the letter because this was a cross-party problem, but Labour's press release was really rather partisan. The message from Labour was that 91 Tories held second jobs worth £4.4m over the past year. For Labour that was just 21 and worth £1m (much of it earned by Gordon Brown and fed into his charitable foundation). Still, the push from Labour left the Conservatives with little choice but to act, or else look weak. That is why Sir Malcolm was so quickly also suspended from his party - despite the likely backlash from Tory backbenchers. But on second jobs Mr Cameron disagrees. He gave the example of an MP who also worked as an obstetrician arguing that was a positive thing. In reality that is not the type of role that would necessarily be hit by Labour's idea (unless it came under a salary cap) but it opens up a rift between the two men. And Labour thinks it is something that they can use to their advantage - regardless of Mr Straw's involvement in today's story."

The How I Met Your Mother star was drafted in after a lacklustre few years with organisers hoping his song and dance background might reverse a fall in television viewing ratings. :: See the full list of winners Harris kicked off the proceedings on an edgy note, saying it was a night to celebrate ""Hollywood's best and whitest - sorry, brightest"" - a cutting reference to this year's total lack of non-white acting nominees. But the reaction on Twitter to his efforts has been mainly negative and in some instances quite brutal. Harris with his husband before the ceremony One viewer, tweeting as MikeSheaAP, said: ""Neil Patrick Harris is hemmed in by bad jokes. He also acts like he has so many restrictions on him he's nervous on how to improv safely."" Journalist Tina Brown called him ""smirking"" and ""clueless"", while Empire Magazine's Chris Hewitt said: ""As star of How I Met Your Mother, Neil Patrick Harris has form with unfunny formats being stretched out beyond their natural finishing line.""

The New York Times' Alessandra Stanley called Harris' performance ""bland"". Another viewer, @SpindriftBeck, said: ""There's still time to tack on 'Neil Patrick Harris's Career' to the end of this In Memoriam package."" Some said that while Harris started off well he appeared to lose confidence as some of his jokes fell flat with Hollywood's A-listers. His appearance in his underwear - or his ""tighty whities"" - got some laughs and was described as ""a ballsy move"". On Twitter, he acknowledged the support of his gag writers toiling behind the scenes. ""I'm super appreciative for the group of writers we hired for my #Oscars content.

The footage comes just days after an alleged racist incident involving Chelsea football fans on the Paris Metro. The short film was taken on the Tube shortly before a London derby between West Ham and Tottenham, which traditionally has a large Jewish fanbase. The clip was uploaded to Twitter by Spurs fan @RomanGeezer, who said: ""On the train on the way to the game, West Ham fans break into song in Stamford Hill, a Jewish area, scum."" His profile and the video subsequently disappeared from the social media network for a short time but later reappeared. Many took to Twitter to express their shock at the footage. Doug McGregor tweeted: ""What is wrong with these bigots. It's the 21st century."" And Ollie Davis posted: ""Absolutely disgusting."" British Transport Police has confirmed it is investigating the latest report. A spokesman said: ""We are encouraged the public has the confidence to report incidents of inappropriate and offensive football-related behaviour to us. ""Officers ask anyone who has information or footage on this latest incident on the London Underground at Stamford Hill, or any others, to contact us so the matter can be fully investigated by detectives.

Anti-racism organisation Kick It Out said in a statement: ""Kick It Out has received several reports via social media about the footage and will be liaising with British Transport Police on the matter. ""In addition, we have been informed of a number of anti-Semitic tweets which we are reporting to the police.""

""We hope that those individuals responsible for this vile behaviour are identified and dealt with in the strongest way possible."" Meanwhile, a former policeman who was sought by officers investigating racist abuse by Chelsea supporters in Paris has apologised.

The 39-year-old, along with two colleagues, is being investigated over the screening process she participated in at Heathrow Airport after flying from Sierra Leone. Ms Cafferkey has not been suspended from her duties, but she faces an interim hearing where restrictions could be placed on her ability to practise. A spokesperson for Public Health England said: ""During our recent assessment of the screening of some returning healthcare workers at Heathrow on 28 December, information emerged which needed to be passed to the General Medical Council and the Nursing and Midwifery Council. ""Since the introduction of screening in October, PHE has assessed over 4,000 individuals and this experience has been used by PHE to continuously strengthen the system."" The body has stressed that the risk posed by Ebola to the general public remains low, but refused to comment further on the investigation faced by Ms Cafferkey, which could last up to 18 months. Her temperature was tested seven times before she began her onward journey from Heathrow to Glasgow - and although she was cleared to fly, the nurse fell ill a couple of days later. Ms Cafferkey was transferred to an isolation unit at the Royal Free Hospital in north London, and although critically ill for a time, she soon made a full recovery. A spokeswoman for the Nursing and Midwifery Council told Sky News: ""Following information we received from Public Health England, we can confirm that we are investigating allegations about the conduct of three nurses. ""It would not be appropriate to comment further at this time."""

Rene Tkacik, 44, was working on a Crossrail site in central London on March 7 last year when the wet concrete - the equivalent of a bag of building sand - collapsed onto him, St Pancras Coroner's Court was told. He lay unconscious for 15 minutes before medical staff arrived. A report by the medical attendant who attended the scene stated Mr Tkacik of Hackney Road, east London, died from ""blunt force trauma to the head and chest"". Investigators told the inquest the area being sprayed with concrete had not been cordoned off at the time of the accident. A statement read to the jury from Mr Tkacik's wife, Renata, said he was a very experienced construction worker, whose main priority was his family. He sent money home to Slovakia to pay for the education of his daughter, Esther. Mrs Tkacik said: ""He never went out with friends in the evening, he would just talk to me - he came here to raise funds to provide a university education for our daughter. ""He had worked as a concrete sprayer and was hugely experienced with that."" She had travelled with his mother and three sisters from Slovakia to attend the inquest. The jury was shown a digital reconstruction of the 80ft (24m) deep tunnel in Fisher Street, Holborn, where Mr Tkacic died. Investigating officer Cavin McGrath said: ""The tunnel was being widened from the top. ""About a metre of concrete spraying would take place and the collapse was right underneath where it had just been sprayed. ""It was just under a tonne of concrete that came down, which is the equivalent of a bag of building sand."" The inquest heard that when the concrete fell on Mr Tkacik, the area was still being sprayed, and work had only halted so the machine could be refilled. Asked whether there were any rope or chains cordoning off the area at the time of the tragedy, Mr McGrath: ""There was not."" He also confirmed no one was facing prosecution over the fatality."

Sky News Weather Producer Rebecca Yussuf said: ""There will be gusts of 50-60mph around the coasts and hills in the North and West. Winds of up to 60mph are expected in some northern areas ""Scotland, Northern Ireland and northern England will see fresh accumulations of snow, especially over the higher ground. ""The Scottish Highlands can expect significant accumulations of 10 to 20 centimetres (four to eight inches) overnight.

There will be fresh accumulations of snow in northern parts of the UK ""There is a continued risk of coastal flooding at high tide on Monday."" The latest bout of wintry weather is being caused by a deep area of low pressure moving to the northwest of Scotland on Monday. The forecast for the rest of the week remains ""unsettled, wet and windy thanks to a succession of low pressure systems"", said Yussuf."

Harris was jailed for more than five years last year after being convicted of a string of indecent assaults, including one on an eight-year-old. Another of his young victims was the best friend of his daughter Bindi, The shamed 84-year-old artist and musician has now lost his Officer and Member of the Order of Australia honours. A statement from the secretary of the order of Australia said: ""It is notified for general information that the Governor-General has terminated the appointments of Officer and Member of the Order of Australia in the General Division, made to: Mr Rolf Harris"". Gallery: Rolf Harris' Career In Pictures Rolf Harris was born on March 30, 1930, and grew up in Perth, Western Australia. As a boy, he became interested in art and his talent was recognised at primary school. There have also been calls for Harris to lose his CBE in Britain. Honours given by Buckingham Palace can be revoked when the person is judged to have brought the system into disrepute. The Honours and Appointments Secretariat can recommend to the forfeiture committee to remove an honour if a person has been found guilty of a crime. The decision to strip an individual of an honour must be approved by the Queen. During sentencing last year, Mr Justice Sweeney told Harris: ""Your reputation lies in ruins. You have been stripped of your honours and you have no one to blame but yourself. ""You took advantage of the trust placed in you because of your celebrity status to commit the offences."" Harris' BAFTA fellowship was removed following his conviction, while he was also stripped of an honorary degree from the University of East London. During his seven-week trial, prosecutor Sasha Wass described Harris as a ''sinister pervert''. She claimed he had a ''dark side'' and was a ''Jekyll and Hyde character''."

Ahmed Nawaz is comfortable and stable at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital after an operation on his arm at the weekend. His younger brother, Haris, 13, was among 141 children and staff who lost their lives when terrorists attacked the school in December. ""He was shot in the head and was brutally murdered and there were bullets coming out of his mouth"", his father Muhammad told Sky News. Mr Nawaz said Ahmed, his eldest son, ""played dead"". Gallery: Boy Treated In UK After Massacre Ahmed Nawaz is pictured on a flight from Pakistan to Birmingham with his family after he was injured in a massacre carried out by the Taliban ""Ahmed said 'as I was lying there silently, in front of me was a teacher, she was suffering from pain and screaming',"" said Mr Nawaz. According to Mr Nawaz, his son also said: ""After that when the terrorists saw she was suffering so much with pain they fired at her again three or four times, then they put something on the body and they lit a match and set her alight in front of them."" Ahmed, who is being treated at his country's expense in the UK, is thought to be the only survivor of the massacre flown over for specialist care. His treatment could take many months. ""While he was in pain, he used to have dreams and would wake up screaming and shouting,"" said his mother Samina. ""This happened for a month, he used to shout out 'Kalashnikov Kalashnikov' and get up screaming. He still sees the Taliban in his dreams."" The family have been welcomed to Birmingham by Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani schoolgirl shot in the head by the Taliban for promoting education. They, like Malala and her father, have been warned not to return to Pakistan. For Ahmed's little brother Umar the happy times seem so far away. ""Us three brothers used to play with each other, argue, fight with each other, but had a lot of love for each other,"" said Umar. ""I cry a lot for my brothers."" The family say it will be for Ahmed to decide whether he eventually wants to return home to Pakistan."

""It belongs to one exceptional family; Stephen, Jane, Jonathan and the Hawking children.""

Julianne Moore was thrilled with her win for Still Alice Many critics had also tipped it for best film, but Birdman's late awards season momentum appeared to carry it through. Ralph Fiennes' movie The Grand Budapest Hotel also had a good night, tieing with Birdman on four gongs. It came up trumps for costume design; make-up and hairstyling; production design; and best original score. The movie started the night with nine nominations, matched by Birdman. British talent was also recognised for The Phone Call, which picked up best live action short film.

Lady Gaga's 50th anniversary Sound Of Music tribute provided one of the night's musical interludes, as did best song nominee Rita Ora. But it was Martin Luther King film Selma that won best original song for Glory. The tears of its British star, David Oyelowo, appeared on screens across the world as he broke down during a rousing ensemble performance. But a bum-note appeared to come from Oscars host and song-and-dance man Neil Patrick Harris. His moment in the spotlight drew criticism from social media users, with many on Twitter calling him ""boring"" and criticising his jokes. Harris kicked off the show with a quip the night would honour the ""best and whitest"" - alluding to criticism over the lack of black nominees. The hashtag #OscarsSoWhite soon began picking up steam. The How I Met Your Mother star then launched into a song featuring Jack Black and dancing Stormtroopers. Lego Movie song Everything Is Awesome also entertained the acting glitterati. A motley crew of characters pounded out the catchy tune as Oprah Winfrey posed with a yellow Lego statuette. The film, the most successful in the UK in 2014, was controversially snubbed in the animated film category - won on the night by Disney's Big Hero 6.

Rivers had never won an Oscar, but she was a staple of the awards season after hosting the E! network’s red carpet coverage for nearly 20 years. John Barrowman took to Twitter to complain She has been credited with transforming it from a catwalk to an event in itself. The actor John Barrowman tweeted: ""Where was #JoanRivers in the memorial mentions. Just saying."" Gallery: Joan Rivers: A Career In Comedy Joan Rivers was often pictured at events with her daughter Melissa. The pair also had their own reality television programme called Joan & Melissa: Joan Knows Best? Another viewer, @DevinScillian, said: ""I wish Joan Rivers was alive so we could hear her choice words about whoever decided to leave her out of the memorial segment."" Although best-known as a comic, Rivers had also appeared in several films including The Muppets Take Manhattan and Shrek 2. The 81-year-old died on 4 September after complications during surgery. Italian film fans were also left disappointed by the exclusion of the award-winning director Francesco Rosi, who died in January. He won a BAFTA in 1983 for Christ Stopped At Eboli, and the Grand Prix at Cannes in 1972 for The Mattei Affair. The Academy’s tribute included Robin Williams, Mickey Rooney and Lauren Bacall.

Classmates of Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and Amira Abase, 15, have now returned to Bethnal Green Academy following half-term. The trio disappeared last week - two months after a fellow pupil is thought to have left to join IS in Syria. Prime Minister David Cameron said airlines and internet companies need to do more to prevent radicalised British teens reaching the Middle East to join the terrorist group. Mr Cameron told MPs he was ""horrified"" over by the case of the three London girls and announced that Home Secretary Theresa May and Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin will be talking with airlines on new ""proportionate"" arrangements to ensure that children who are at risk are properly identified and questioned. He also said internet companies must live up to their ""social responsibility"" by taking down extremist content and improving co-operation with the authorities over contacts between extremists and young people. Meanwhile, Bethnal Green Academy principal Mark Keary revealed that police had spoken to Shamima, Kadiza and Amira at the time and found ""no evidence that the girls were at risk of being radicalised or absconding"". Staff at the school were briefed by police upon their return to work, Mr Keary said, while all pupils have been offered agency support. He added: ""From the increasing number of similar news reports around the world, it is clear that this is an international issue which is increasing in severity and it's affecting schools across the country and beyond. ""We are constantly reviewing our safeguarding procedures."" Mr Keary said social media was ""strictly regulated"" at the school - with no access to Facebook or Twitter. This follows the revelation that a tweet from an account under Shamima's name was sent to Aqsa Mahmood, who left Glasgow for Syria to be a so-called jihadi bride in 2013. Aamer Anwar, the lawyer representing Aqsa's family, told Sky News that security authorities were not passing on intelligence which could allow families to prevent their children from travelling to Syria or Iraq. Gallery: Three Schoolgirls From East London Go Missing These pictures were taken from Kadiza Sultana (l) and Shamima Begum's (r) Twitter accounts These failings mean the UK is ""exporting terror"" abroad, he said. This accusation came as six French citizens had their passports confiscated after allegedly planning to travel to Syria, according to a security source. The right to remove passports was introduced there amid a raft of new counter-terrorism laws in November. Meanwhile, officers from the Metropolitan Police have now arrived in Turkey as the search for the girls continues. Relatives of the trio have made emotional pleas for them to come home. The three girls were last seen on Tuesday morning as they left their homes, telling their families they would be out for the day. They are thought to have boarded a Turkish Airlines flight at Gatwick, which landed in Istanbul on Tuesday evening, with the intention to cross into Syria and join IS. The father of Amira, Abase Hussen, said his family was ""completely different now"". ""We are depressed, and it's very stressful,"" he said. ""The message we have for Amira is to get back home. We miss you. We cannot stop crying. Please think twice. Don't go to Syria."""

Defence Secretary Michael Fallon told MPs the 19-year-old serviceman, who travelled to northern Iraq, was being returned to his unit. It is understood UK intelligence services were able to trace him to Kurdish-controlled Syria just over the border. A message was delivered to the Peshmerga asking for him to be returned and they obliged. He was taken to the British consulate in Irbil. UK special forces were not involved in the operation. Sky's Defence Correspondent Alistair Bunkall said: ""Clearly the Kurds agreed with the British view, that it wasn't in everyone's best interest to have a British soldier publicly running away from his regiment to join the fight against orders when the two militaries are on the same side."" The soldier had said he was joining the Peshmerga in their battle against the Sunni extremists because he wanted to help them. The soldier wanted to help the Kurds in their fight against Islamic State But speaking during Commons defence questions, Mr Fallon said: ""The House may also want to know the soldier reported as missing last week has now been located and is being returned to his unit."" The serviceman, who is not being named, had told his parents of his plans in a text message last week and had informed friends he intended to spend a year in the region. He travelled via Dubai telling his family he was taking a holiday there. He was not officially AWOL as he was on leave. After the man informing his family he was going to help the Kurds in their fight, worried relatives contacted Sky News. His parents have released a statement where they said they were relieved he was safe. They said: ""The sense of relief on being told our son is in safe hands has been overwhelming. ""It has been an emotionally gruelling few days and we have been beside ourselves with worry. We are just so grateful to know he is safe."" The serviceman has been in the Army since leaving school at 16 and is known to have been been learning Arabic. One text message to his family said: ""I've gone to join the Kurds in Syria and Iraq. I'm with other British people and a Canadian at the moment. ""I don't know how to explain it to you but I really want and need to do this and I will be safe."" Another message said: ""I have good skills and I can speak the language I can help these people and help with this fight."" And a third said: ""I'm so sorry to put you through this but I do good, I will get in trouble for being AWOL but it's minor and no prison sentence."" When news of the soldier leaving his base emerged, an Army spokesman said they were aware of the reports and were investigating. It is not the first time Britons have gone to fight with the Peshmerga. Former public schoolboy Macer Gifford gave up a job in the City to sign up with Kurdish fighters battling IS in northern Syria. And ex-soldiers Jamie Read and James Hughes told Sky News how they dodged bullets during chaotic patrols with Kurdish forces. They also said they vowed to kill each other rather than get captured in a death pact."

The man was arrested by Greater Manchester Police on Sunday and has now been bailed until 30 April. Mrs Danczuk, who became well known for her Twitter selfies, claimed the abuse took place between 1989 and 1995 when she was aged between six and 12. She waived her right to anonymity in The Sun last week and told the Mail on Sunday she had reported her alleged attacker to the police. Detective Inspector Caroline Ward, of Greater Manchester Police, said: ""We work hard to support victims of sexual offences and thoroughly investigate all reports of sexual abuse and rape no matter how long ago they happened.

Linda Carty was convicted of the murder of her neighbour Joana Rodriguez and the abduction of her four-day-old son in 2001 and sentenced to death. British-based human rights organisation Reprieve has unearthed new evidence which alleges that key witness Christopher Robinson, who claimed to have seen Carty kill Ms Rodriguez, has now admitted that he lied. Mr Robinson, in a September 2014 affidavit, said the Texan district attorneys ""threatened and intimidated"" him into identifying her as the murderer, Reprieve said, and ""[told] me I would get the death penalty myself if Linda Carty did not get the death penalty"". Other witnesses have also admitted they were ""blackmailed"" by prosecutors and lied or omitted evidence as a result. Lawyers for the 56-year-old, who is originally from the British Virgin Islands but had lived in Houston for nearly 20 years prior to her conviction, argue that prosecutors arranged for a deal with a co-defendant which was never disclosed to her defence team and that four jurors now say they would either have acquitted her or not given her a death sentence. Charles Mathis, a former Drugs Enforcement Agency (DEA) officer who was Carty's ""handler"" while she worked as an informer, has said the district attorneys threatened to reveal an invented affair if he did not testify against her. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals is now considering the evidence. Celia Ouellette, a lawyer at Reprieve, said: ""This is a wonderful day for Linda - and for justice. ""That a prosecutor can threaten witnesses to lie under oath and testify against a woman, who ends up being convicted of murder and sentenced to death as a direct result, is truly devastating. ""We look forward to giving Linda a day in court that is not rigged against her from the start."""

The masked men enter the Vardon Supermarket in Kings Norton and the footage shows one threaten the shopkeeper with what appears to be a handgun. They demand money but after opening the till the storekeeper activates the alarm and grabs a baseball bat. He threatens the robbers who make off with nothing more than a crate of beer and a mobile phone. Both men are described as white, in their 20s, around 5ft 10 to 6ft tall and thinly built. One was wearing a blue jacket, a hooded top and tracksuit bottoms. The other wore a black jacket and black tracksuit bottoms.

""The shopkeeper acted bravely to defend his livelihood and in this case it paid off, but the reality is this could have ended in tragedy. ""We would not recommend acts of heroism when confronted by a potentially loaded gun."" The robbery happened just after 7.30pm on Tuesday 6 January.

2015-02-26,"Sex predator Jimmy Savile could have been stopped from carrying out his depraved abuse decades earlier, an inquiry has found.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150226192936/http://news.sky.com/story/1434666/savile-missed-chance-to-stop-decades-of-abuse,"Sex predator Jimmy Savile could have been stopped from carrying out his depraved abuse decades earlier, an inquiry has found. A report into a catalogue of sex attacks by the disgraced presenter at Stoke Mandeville Hospital revealed staff knew of 10 allegations against him but failed to act. And investigators said if a formal complaint against Savile back in 1977 over the rape and abuse of an 11-year-old girl had been properly handled, the celebrity DJ probably would have been caught at the time. Savile has been branded an 'opportunistic predator' The report was among a series published into the abuse carried out by Savile at hospitals across the country, where he preyed on children as young as five and seriously ill patients. There were even claims Savile had sex with dead bodies in the mortuary at Stoke Mandeville, in a chilling echo of previous allegations against him at Leeds General Infirmary. While the inquiry found no proof of this, it found evidence Savile had unsupervised access to the morgue. So far more than 170 people have made abuse claims against Savile, covering a period from 1954 to just before his death in 2011. And it has been warned many aspects of the Savile scandal could be repeated in the future. One wide-ranging report taking in all the NHS investigations found the access given to Savile to dozens of hospitals gave him the ""opportunity to commit sexual abuses on a grand scale for nearly 50 years."" And its author, Kate Lampard, told Sky News: ""There are still risks and weaknesses in the arrangements in hospitals for keeping people safe."" His status as a celebrity and fundraiser was ""enhanced by the endorsement and encouragement he received from politicians, senior civil servants and NHS managers"". As a result, staff were reluctant to challenge Savile or report him, Ms Lampard said. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has apologised to the victims, and also criticised government ministers at the time who he said failed to ask ""hard questions"" about Savile. He told MPs: ""Never again must the power of money or celebrity blind us to repeated clear signals that some extremely vulnerable people were being abused. ""People were either too dazzled or too intimidated by the nation's favourite celebrity to confront the evil predator we now know he was."" He said there should have been a stronger incentive on staff to report abuse claims, and highlighted a consultation on proposals to introduce a mandatory duty on NHS workers to act. He would be accepting 13 recommendations in principle that were made in Ms Lampard's report. But Mr Hunt said he would not accept the proposal for all NHS volunteers to go through enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks. The Stoke Mandeville report revealed Savile abused at least 60 people connected with the hospital over more than 20 years, including patients, staff and visitors. The offences ranged from groping and molesting through to rape. His victims there included children as young as eight and vulnerable patients. Those staff who complained about Savile's behaviour, were ""severely reprimanded"". Dr Androulla Johnstone, who wrote the Stoke Mandeville report, told a press conference Savile was an ""opportunistic predator who on occasion could also show a high degree of premeditation"" when planning attacks. She said: ""The individuals to whom these incidents were reported failed in their duty to protect. ""Consequentially, no intelligence about Savile's behaviour was gathered over the years and no action was taken. ""Whilst witnesses told us it was an open secret within the hospital that Savile was a lecher and general nuisance, none stated that they knew about his sexual abuse activities."" Lawyer Liz Dux, who represents many of the Stoke Mandeville victims, said it ""beggars belief"" the report found no evidence of senior staff being aware of the abuse. But Dr Johnstone rejected claims of a ""cover-up"" by staff, and said Savile's behaviour went unchallenged due to a ""general disbelief"". Savile, who received a knighthood in 1990, died in 2011 and so never faced justice for his crimes."
2015-02-26,"Ladbrokes has revealed a significant rise in earnings from gaming machines described by critics as the ""crack cocaine of gambling"", ahead of an industry-wide crackdown on their use.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150226192936/http://news.sky.com/story/1434714/ladbrokes-nets-more-cash-from-gaming-machines,"Ladbrokes has revealed a significant rise in earnings from gaming machines described by critics as the ""crack cocaine of gambling"", ahead of an industry-wide crackdown on their use. The bookmaker said it was now making almost £1,000 weekly from each of its so-called fixed-odds betting terminals after adding 9,000 to its stable in the first half of 2014. Ladbrokes said such gaming revenues from activities including roulette grew ""ahead of expectations"" by 6.4% in the second half. The company revealed the gross win for Ladbrokes per terminal per week was £996 in its fourth quarter, up from £913 during 2013 and £682 in 2008. It meant it was now making 14% more via its in-store machines than its traditional over-the-counter betting offering. Ladbrokes said that while new regulations on £50-plus staking were being introduced by the Government in the second quarter of the current year, it was ""already preparing our shop teams to meet the new requirements whilst continuing to deliver a good customer experience."" The regulatory crackdown on fixed-odds terminals, on which punters can potentially wager £100 every 20 seconds, aims to limit stakes in a bid to curb problem gambling. The earnings figures were contained in the company's results which showed a 44% dip in group annual profits - hurt by recovery programme costs which included the closure of 89 poorly performing UK shops. The betting firm, which is set to lose its embattled chief executive Richard Glynn this year amid frustration over a slow response to digital business growth, confirmed it planned to close an additional 60 UK stores this year with compulsory job losses likely. Ladbrokes cited several regulatory ""headwinds"", including a rise in gaming duty from 1 March. Its statutory pre-tax profit for 2014 fell to £37.7m as the company suffered its worst ever football daily loss on Boxing Day of £8.1m through punter wins. But it managed to get the bulk of its retail and digital transformation plans ready in time for the World Cup. As a result, group revenues rose 3.8% in the year to £1.2bn, with digital revenues rising 23% to £215.1m. Richard Glynn, who will leave the business once a successor is appointed, said: ""Ladbrokes entered 2014 clear on what needed to be done to deliver a successful World Cup and to move from operational delivery in H1 (first half) to financial growth in H2 (second half). ""We delivered against all our operational targets, enjoyed a successful World Cup and saw clear growth in key areas of the business.  ""The changes put in place have made us competitive and our customers are responding. ""Strong operational delivery delivered a second half of growth as envisaged but the £8m hit on Boxing Day did take some of the shine off our performance. ""However, this is the business we are in and does not overshadow the positive customer reaction. ""Ladbrokes exited 2014 with pleasing operational metrics and is in good shape to compete even more effectively with a clear view on what more needs to be done.   ""2015 will see new management but the focus on satisfying customer demands, improving the resilience of our retail estate, growing internationally and further improving our Digital offer remains. ""Whilst recognising there are regulatory headwinds, Ladbrokes is confident in its plans for 2015."" Commenting directly on its fixed-odds gaming terminals, a spokesman said: ""Ladbrokes machine performance has improved in 2014 largely due to our rolling out of a new product and the growth of lower stake games, which now account for nearly 40% of our revenue and growing. ""We have delivered this growth with increasing standards of social responsibility and interaction with customers over setting limits.  ""We no longer advertise machines in our shop windows and the growth has largely been driven by customer demand."""

Emwazi was born in Kuwait and comes from a well-to-do family, according to the Washington Post. He grew up in northwest London and graduated from the University of Westminster with a degree in computer programming. US journalist James Foley was one of the hostages killed Aged 27, he is believed to have travelled to Syria in 2012 and to have joined Islamic State (IS) later. A close friend of Emwazi told the newspaper: ""I have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John. ""He was like a brother to me... I am sure it is him."" A representative of the British advocacy group CAGE who had been in contact with Emwazi before he left for Syria also said he believed he was ""Jihadi John"". ""There was an extremely strong resemblance,"" research director Asim Qureshi said after watching a video of him beheading a hostage. He later described Emwazi as ""extremely kind, extremely gentle... and the most humble young person that I ever knew"". Emwazi rose to notoriety last August in an IS video in which he killed American journalist James Foley. Since then he has appeared in a series of videos documenting the gruesome murders of other hostages, including British aid workers Alan Henning and David Haines. In each, he taunts audiences and is dressed all in black, with a balaclava covering his face. He wears a holster under his left arm. The family of American Steven Sotloff, who was killed by IS last year, said in a statement: ""We look forward to the day he (""Jihadi John"") is prosecuted and convicted of his crimes. ""That is American justice and why we will ultimately prevail over the forces that seek to destroy our way of life."" The Washington Post claims Emwazi started to radicalise after a planned safari in Tanzania following his graduation was brought to an abrupt end. He was detained on arrival in Dar es Salaam and deported. Gallery: Profile Of Alan Henning Alan Henning, 47, was born in Salford, Greater Manchester. Friends gave him the nickname ""gadget"" due to his love of technology. The British aid worker was murdered by Islamic State militants in Syria. He is said to have told friends he was flown to Amsterdam where an officer from MI5 accused him of trying to reach Somalia, where the militant group al Shabab operates. Shortly afterward, Emwazi moved to his native Kuwait, where he landed a job working for a computer firm. He returned to London twice, the second time to finalise his wedding plans to a woman in Kuwait, but was prevented from going back after being detained by counter-terrorism officials. Downing Street declined to confirm or deny if Emwazi's name was known to the intelligence and security services. Asked if David Cameron was concerned about him being identified, a spokeswoman said: ""The Prime Minister would be concerned about information being put into the public domain at any time that might jeopardise ongoing police or security investigations or the safety of British citizens."" A spokesman for the University of Westminster said: ""We condemn the promotion of radicalisation, terrorism and violence or threats against any member of our community. Gallery: Profile Of David Haines David Haines was born in Holderness, East Yorkshire in 1970. He was raised in Scotland, where his parents still live ""We have strict policies to promote tolerance among our 20,000 student community, who come to study from over 150 nations."" A statement from the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King's College London said: ""We believe that the identity and name published by the Washington Post and now in the public realm to be accurate and correct."" The statement added: ""This demonstrates what we have long said about radicalisation, that it is not something driven by poverty or social deprivation. ""Ideology clearly plays a big role in motivating some men to participate in jihadist causes."""

Mirjana Puhar, 19, was found dead inside a home in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Tuesday night. Two other bodies were also found at the scene. Emmanuel Jesus Rangel, 19, was arrested on Wednesday and charged with three counts of murder. Charlotte police said the incident appeared to be drug-related, and that the suspect knew all three victims. Celebrity news website TMZ reported the murders occurred at the home of Puhar's boyfriend, whom she had only been dating a few months. Puhar appeared on the 21st cycle of the TV show, which premiered in August. She advanced to become one of the show's finalists before being voted out in the 10th episode. The CW network, which airs the show, has not commented on Puhar's death."
2015-02-26,"Did she, didn't she? No. Is the short answer.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150226192936/http://news.sky.com/story/1434790/did-defence-minister-drop-commons-c-bomb,"Did she, didn't she? No. Is the short answer. Anna Soubry had a longer answer: ""I beg your pardon. I can be heard saying what? No. Absolutely not. Never. Never…"" and so goes on Ms Soubry's 600-word rebuttal over allegations she used the C-word in the House of Commons, in a comment supposedly directed at Ed Miliband. It's an overlong response but I have to say I agree with her. The Defence Minister defended her reputation after it was alleged that the foul language had been picked up in a recording inside Westminster for BBC documentary Inside The Commons. It's clear from the footage that the Conservative MP says ""sanctimonious… (something)"" , but the camera pulls away after this point so we don't see her lips moving. There is strong speculation, based on the audio, that she used the C-word and when asked about it yesterday after PMQs a spokesman for Mr Miliband said: ""It seems clear that this is unacceptable language. She should apologise immediately."" Now, maybe it is my ears – but when I listen to it, as I have several times, I think she says ""sanctimonious rubbish."" There are a lot of other pitches from the 600 plus MPs in the room that disrupts what we hear and bear in mind that, as the camera moves, the direction of the microphone moves with it, picking up these other sounds. But you still hear a distinct ""...sh"" at the end of the audio which seems to come from Ms Soubry and careful listeners might pick up the full word ""rubbish"" amidst the clamour. In her response Ms Soubry protests: ""I do not use it in my ordinary life and I would never use it in the House of Commons and I am profoundly offended at the suggestion I ever would. ""I just don't use that word and anyone will tell you that because I'm an old feminist who hates that word. If there's word I loathe, it's that word."" One thinks of the Plebgate scandal – one word that destroyed the career of Andrew Mitchell. In this instance, I think Ms Soubry has been given a bad rap, but other people's ears seem to hear different things."
2015-02-26,UKIP leader Nigel Farage is expected to get a celebrity reception in Washington when he addresses America's most high-profile right-wing conference this week.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150226192936/http://news.sky.com/story/1434350/farage-to-get-heros-welcome-from-us-group,"By Dominic Waghorn, US Correspondent UKIP leader Nigel Farage is expected to get a celebrity reception in Washington when he addresses America's most high-profile right-wing conference this week. Sarah Palin, Rand Paul, Jeb Bush and the National Rifle Association (NRA) gun lobby will be sharing a stage with the British politician after he was invited to address the Conservative Political Action Committee in the US capital. Aides told Sky News his philosophy has much in common with his republican hosts, who also focus on ""the battle for smaller government and lower taxes and how an insurgent party can become bigger"". That will go down a storm with much of his audience at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), which appeals to the right wing of the Republican party. Tea party activists claim to have been fighting the same battle in the US. Aides say he has also been asked to share his expertise in international relations, in particular his thoughts on Ukraine, the Greek economic crisis and the possibility of Greece exiting the eurozone. Mr Farage's speech will take place after an address from Sarah Palin The UKIP leader has reportedly built a loyal following in the US as a regular guest on the right-of-centre cable channel Fox News. He can expect a warm welcome. In hyperbolic publicity released by CPAC ahead of his speech on Thursday evening, he was described as a ""political tour de force"" who has ""emerged as a serious and viable candidate who can run England in the near future"". The annual event offers a platform for mainstream politicians, this year including presidential hopeful Jeb Bush, and the more extreme fringe of America's fractious conservative movement. Mr Farage's appearance is wedged between a speech from failed vice-presidential contender Sarah Palin and what's been billed as a ""Good Guys' Reception"", hosted by the all-powerful NRA. On the way to the US, he said he hoped to find common ground with his hosts. ""In Britain, we are fighting against the creation of a client-state, against rampant corporatism, against a career political class that services vested interests,"" he said. He will find plenty of the above in both of America's massively funded political parties, but CPAC aims to be more grassroots.  The rise of the Islamic State is likely to be on the agenda at the conference, and Mr Farage spoke against any military intervention during an interview with Fox News - something that might put him at odds with some of his fellow speakers. ""We can provide expertise, we can provide help, but it's not British and American boots that are going to beat this,"" he said. ""We’ve got to work with all those Arab and African states together."" Mr Farage cited Libya as a recent example in which he said military intervention made things worse. ""We've now made Libya a country in which it's impossible to live as a Christian. Let's think carefully before we get involved in complicated military and social issues. ""This ISIS threat across the whole region - it is a real, genuine evil, it won't be beaten by conventional warfare in a short space of time."" The floors of the conference offer an eclectic mix. Tea Party supporters in eighteenth century costume stride its halls. Libertarians offer questionnaires testing delegates' political purity. Anti-abortion groups hand round plastic foetuses and there are activists opposed to greater gay rights. Mr Farage's speech is followed by hors d'oeuvres, wine and beer. He may have to forego indulging his weakness for the latter if he wants to catch his plane in time to fly home for his party's annual conference in Margate on Friday."

Voting was 287 to 219, a majority of 68, after an ill-tempered debate which followed an angry clash on the issue between David Cameron and Ed Miliband at Prime Minister's questions. During PMQs, the Labour leader appeared to surprise Mr Cameron by pledging that Labour would extend its proposed ban to include MPs serving as paid trade union officials. And as the debate got under way later, Labour attempted to persuade the Government to accept an amendment including the union ban, a move rejected by Commons Leader William Hague. Opening the debate, the shadow Commons leader Angela Eagle said Labour's motion proposed that after the start of the next Parliament no MP should be permitted to hold a directorship or a paid consultancy post. She said: ""This is a commitment that we will honour in the Labour Party by changing the Parliamentary Labour Party standing orders. William Hague ridiculed Labour's motion ""The perception is growing that some MPs are only it for what they can get rather than what they can give. This is not an impression which I believe we can allow to fester for any longer. ""'You are all in it for yourselves' - How many times have we heard that said?"" Labour backbenchers angrily attacked Tory MPs Merseyside MP Steve Rotheram pointed at the Government benches and said: ""Nobody forces us to come in here and get paid £67,000, which is a king's ransom to a lot of the people that we represent and they don't need second jobs. But if they do, there are food banks in every one of their constituencies, go and volunteer in them."" But Labour's proposals were ridiculed by Mr Hague, in a witty speech in which he questioned if Labour would limit MPs from earning money from writing good books. To laughs, he said: ""The only way to ensure sales from such a book remained under their cap would be to write an unsuccessful book, of which there are also examples on the Labour benches. ""By what logic according to (Labour) is it acceptable for an MP to write an unsuccessful book but not a successful one? By what logic is it to write an unsuccessful book but not engage in some other activity no more threatening to the public interest than an unsuccessful book?"" He pointed out to Labour MPs that their party's former prime minister, James Callaghan, had a farm. Mr Hague said: ""Would Lord Callaghan have had to resign from the House every time there was a good harvest and then try to return to it when the crops failed?"" Defending second jobs for MPs, Conservative Dr Phillip Lee, who runs a GP practice, said in his time as an MP that some of the best contributions in Parliament had come from people still working and up to date in their field. And Liberal Democrat John Hemming spoke about his own situation, declaring that he earns £180,000 a year as a director of a company he set up in 1983. But he said that took up just four hours a month and put him in a better position to help constituents by, for example, paying for a benefits adviser and taking legal action against his local council to clean up the streets."

His first stop was Tokyo, where he was being given a guided boat tour of some of the landmarks including the 2020 Olympic site and the Rainbow Bridge. He stopped off at the historic Hama Rikyu gardens, where he was served Japanese green tea in the traditional, ceremonial way by a Grand Master, considered a sign of respect. The Prince was watched by the media drinking the ""thin tea"" or usucha from an antique Korean bowl, at one point joking to his host: ""I don't want to drop it."" The evening will be spent privately at the British Ambassador's official residence. Gallery: Flashback 2009: Royal Action Men Princes William and Harry held a photocall for the world's media to update them on the progress of their training to become military flyers Shortly after the Duke of Cambridge touched down in Tokyo to begin his first tour of Japan and China, Kensington Palace announced that he had passed his air transport pilot’s licence exams. It is a reminder of how the second in line to the throne intends to balance a ""day-job"" with his royal duties. William has been revising since September for his exams - a rigorous process with 14 different tests, which are a prerequisite for training to become an air ambulance pilot. Before he starts flying patients for the East Anglian air ambulance service he will need to do further mandatory training specific to their aircraft, but that should be completed by early summer. Prince William will aim to work as close to full time as possible, covering shifts for the team based in Cambridge and Norwich. His salary will be donated to charity. But WIlliam's focus over the next six days is to highlight British links with Japan and China and address issues such innovation, trade and creativity. The pitching for Britain had started in Tokyo before he arrived with UK designers showing of their latest inventions at the British embassy. Sue Kinoshita, Director of UK Trade and Investment in Japan told Sky News it is a longstanding relationship from which both countries benefit. She said: ""Something like 1,300 Japanese companies have got either manufacturing, research and development or other facilities in the UK employing about 150,000 people, so that's really significant for the UK economy and it's great to have someone here from the Royal family giving that profile as well."""

Sergio Canavero, from the Turin Advanced Neuromodulation Group, wants the surgery to be used to help extend the lives of people who have suffered degeneration of the muscles and nerves or those who have advanced cancer. The surgeon plans to announce the project at the American Academy of Neurological and Orthopaedic Surgeons (AANOS) conference in Annapolis, Maryland, in June, the New Scientist reported. Mr Canavero published a paper on the technique he would use in the Surgical Neurology International journal this month. The recipient's head and the donor body would be cooled at the start of the procedure to extend the time that cells can survive without oxygen. Tissue around the neck would be dissected and major blood vessels would be joined using tiny tubes. The spinal cords would then be cut and the recipient's head moved on to the donor body. The ends of the spinal cord would be fused together using a chemical called polyethylene glycol, which encourages fat within cell membranes to mesh. After this, the person would be put into a coma for around four weeks to prevent them moving while they heal. Mr Canavero said he would expect the patient to be able to move and feel their face when they awoke, they would speak with the same voice and they should be able to walk within a year. He first proposed the idea of the surgery in 2013. He told the New Scientist: ""If society doesn't want it, I won't do it. But if people don't want it, in the US or Europe, that doesn't mean it won't be done somewhere else. ""I'm trying to go about this the right way, but before going to the moon, you want to make sure people will follow you."" The first successful head transplant - involving moving the head of one monkey on to another - was carried out in 1970 at the Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, US. The monkey lived for nine days, but its immune system rejected the head."

The 74-year-old was questioned last August by detectives looking at claims of a sexual offence against a boy in 1985, which he vehemently denies. New developments in the case were revealed in a letter from South Yorkshire Police to Home Affairs Committee Chairman Keith Vaz. The letter, dated 10 February, says: ""South Yorkshire Police detectives are in very regular contact with Sir Cliff Richard's lawyers. Typically this involves a verbal update about once a fortnight. ""This is an investigation which has increased significantly in size since its inception. Sir Cliff Richard's lawyers are aware there is more than one allegation. ""In view of the expanding nature of the investigation, it would be premature and potentially misleading to predict a likely date when it will be concluded."" Sir Cliff's Berkshire home was raided in August A statement released by Sir Cliff said: ""I have no idea where these absurd and untrue allegations come from. ""The police have not disclosed details to me. I have never, in my life, assaulted anyone and I remain confident that the truth will prevail. I have co-operated fully with the police, and will, of course, continue to do so. ""Beyond stating that the allegations are completely false, it would not be appropriate for me to say anything further until the investigation has concluded, which I hope will be very soon. ""In the meantime, I would, again, like to thank everyone for supporting me through this unbelievably difficult period."" Sky News understands the accusation against the performer, which he was questioned about last year, dates back to an event held by American evangelist preacher Billy Graham in Sheffield in 1985. A report by the Home Affairs Select Committee in October said a highly publicised raid on the performer's home in August was ""inept""  and caused ""irreparable damage"" to his reputation. South Yorkshire Police had worked exclusively with the BBC to broadcast live footage of officers searching Sir Cliff's home in Berkshire."
2015-02-26,He has been Islamic State's poster boy of horror.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150226192936/http://news.sky.com/story/1434839/behind-the-twisted-appeal-of-jihadi-john,"He has been Islamic State's poster boy of horror. Once dubbed 'Jihadi John', Mohammed Emwazi, a Kuwaiti-born Briton from northwest London, has been named by friends and associates allegedly as the death cult's best known murderer. Sadly, and dangerously, such notoriety serves the purpose of the movement he has joined - demonstrating a sense of invincibility as a purging 'saint' for the cause. Emwazi, if he is ever formally identified as the infamous killer, appears to closely fit and serves the psychological profile which has driven much of Islamic State's appeal. Experts speak of three important characteristics which drive the appeal of IS. There is the notion of ""cognitive closure"". Islamic State's uncompromising theologically driven world perspective in a world of ""unsettling, anxiety inducing uncertainties"" offers men and women, especially those in the West who are from immigrant backgrounds and may feel alienated, an end to the ""cravings for coherence and closure"", according to Professor Arie Kruglanski, from the University of Maryland. Writing on the E-International Relations website Prof Kruglanski, a leading authority on the minds of terrorists, observed that fundamentalism offers people a ""world of good versus evil, saints versus sinners, order versus chaos; a pure universe in black and white admitting no shades of grey. A fundamentalist ideology… offers a future that is predictable and controllable. ""Such a perspective holds particular fascination for confused youths in transitional stages of their lives, who drift like rudderless ships and find themselves torn by conflicting cultural demands."" Emwazi, a computer science graduate from Westminster University, appears to have been restless. He is reported to have been arrested in Tanzania on suspicion of links to al Shabab in Somalia nine years ago. He complained of being interviewed and ""threatened"" by MI5. He sought work in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia but grew up in the gang-blighted parts of Queen's Park in northwest London.  Jihadi ideology removes uncertainty and provides a sense of superiority - so much so that those who do not share its tenets are deemed worthy only of obliteration. Another appeal of IS is that it offers followers a chance at being significant. Emzawi, or Jihadi John, is seen as a hero by himself, his comrades and internet groupies attracted to his brand of bullying machismo. The message from him is ""you too can be a world player, bring war and bloodshed in return for worldly recognition, and end to the 'humiliation' and rewards in heaven following 'martyrdom'. This ""denotes the supreme importance to humans of being noticed, mattering, and deserving honour and esteem"", Prof Kruglanski writes. In recent months, the base instincts of young men and women are also forming part of the IS appeal. Sex is selling their agenda. Young fighters are promised a bride, sex slaves or captured women, while their groupies are lured to Syria by internet images of handsome armed men and the promise of an Islamic life in the arms of a hero. IS has seen recruitment leap from 10,000 to more than 40,000, with 12,000 foreign fighters of whom at least 3,000 hail from Europe. Emwazi is a magnet for IS recruits. His appeal will only end, says Prof Kruglanski, with ""ignominy, an unglamorous death in the desert with no one to care""."

Lance Corporal Joshua Leakey will receive the honour following a combined US/UK assault on a Taliban stronghold in Helmand Province in 2013. His group came under attack from around 20 insurgents armed with machine guns and rocket propelled grenades. Under heavy fire he ran to the top of a hill where he realised two friendly machine gun teams had been surrounded. He then moved back down the hill to give first aid to a US Marine Corps captain and began casualty evacuation. Despite being the most junior member of the group, he returned to the top of the hill to take control of a machine gun, before moving position to fire on the enemy. General Sir Nicholas Carter 'humbled to award him the Victoria Cross' Again Lance Cpl Leakey ran 200 metres down the hill, this time to pick up a second machine gun. In 45 degree heat he clambered back up again with 60lbs of equipment on his back, drawing fire. The troops around him were inspired by his actions and started fighting back. During the battle, 11 insurgents were killed and four wounded. According to his citation, his ""gritty leadership"" well-above his junior rank, ""single-handedly regained the initiative and prevented considerable loss of life"". On hearing the news he was to receive the British armed forces' highest military honour, he said: ""Why me? Why on earth have they picked me out for this. ""It's amazing to receive this, it's outrageous really. But it represents something more than just me, my mates who were there with me at the time, the rest of that tour, all the other tours the battalion has done and the regiment as well."" The Head of the Army, General Sir Nicholas Carter, clearly moved when announcing the honour , said he was ""humbled to award him the Victoria Cross"". The award comes almost 70 years after another member of his family was given the same honour. His second cousin twice removed, Sergeant Nigel Gray Leakey, was a posthumous recipient of the Victoria Cross in November 1945 for his gallantry while fighting in Africa during the Second World War."

Instead his wife, Samantha, passes her picks to him under the changing-room door ""like feeding time at the zoo"". In an interview with Woman and Home, the Prime Minister said he tended to prefer plain clothes - he is often pictured on holidays in a blue poloshirt - and was an M&S and Gap man. The PM seen with his sister-in-law in 2013. Pic: Instagram/Emily Sheffield Mr Cameron said: ""I'm very lucky because Samantha is amazing, she truly is the empress of multitasking, and amazing at doing it all, from overseeing the children's homework, having a business life of her own, doing a lot of charity work, and supporting me as Prime Minister. ""Samantha has extremely good taste. And I'm not really interested in clothes, mainly I like wearing clothes that don't make me stand out. Gallery: Blue Shirt? It Must Be Holiday Time Another casual blue shirt, another Cameron holiday. David Cameron and his wife Samantha are pictured at a fish market in Portugal where they are on holiday. ""I tend to go for Marks & Spencer and Gap, and I do get put in the changing room at Gap and clothes are passed to me under the changing room door - a bit like feeding time at the zoo!"" He has also given an insight into what keeps him ""chillaxed"" - barbecues, bike rides and box sets apparently. Mr Cameron said he preferred to spend his down time in his Oxfordshire constituency home, rather than at Downing Street or Chequers. He said his perfect evening would involve preparing dinner - his signature dishes, he says, are ""something slow-cooked like belly of pork or shoulder of lamb"" - and watching television - a detective drama or House of Cards. He said: ""I really profoundly believe in this job and what I'm doing but I try to keep a balance because although this job is a complete passion, at the same time it's my judgement that matters so I've got to keep good balance and pace to make sure I don't get frazzled and fried. ""So I do take breaks: last weekend I did an eight-mile bicycle ride along the Windrush Valley in beautiful cold sunshine with Samantha and two of our children. ""That, to me, was a perfect Sunday morning."" Mr Cameron says his children have dealt ""sensibly"" with having a father who is Prime Minister."
2015-02-26,Three Al Jazeera journalists have been arrested for allegedly flying a drone aircraft over the Bois de Boulogne park in Paris.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150226192936/http://news.sky.com/story/1434297/paris-drone-al-jazeera-journalists-arrested,"Three Al Jazeera journalists have been arrested for allegedly flying a drone aircraft over the Bois de Boulogne park in Paris. Police said that ""for the moment"" there was no connection with other unexplained night-time sightings of drones over the city. A police source told the AFP news agency: ""The first was piloting the drone, the second was filming and the third was watching."" But Al Jazeera correspondent Jacky Rowland said the journalists were in fact making a report about the drones spotted over the city on Monday and Tuesday nights. She tweeted: ""3 #AlJazeera colleagues detained in #Paris were doing report about the mystery #drones  Let's be clear:they're not behind the mystery drones."" At least five have been spotted over the last two nights at locations including the US Embassy, the Eiffel Tower and major thoroughfares in central Paris. The unmanned aircraft are said to have been reported by witnesses and security forces. Paris is on high alert after the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks last month. However, government spokesman Stephane Le Foll warned against scaremongering, saying: ""People should not be worried but vigilant, it's an issue which is taken very seriously."" Flying drones over the French capital requires permission from authorities but none was sought for any of the recent sightings. The reports are the latest in a series of unexplained drone flights over the city and elsewhere across the country. Authorities were first alerted to mystery drone flights in October, when state-run power company EDF filed a complaint with police. The company had detected tiny unmanned planes buzzing around the skies above seven atomic plants. The sightings continued into November, and altogether some 20 flyovers took place near nuclear plants. In January, a pilotless aircraft also flew over the presidential palace in Paris. Sensitive areas are protected by a no-fly zone that spans a 1.6-mile radius to a height of 1,000 metres. The Al Jazeera journalists arrested have not yet been named but according to AFP are aged 34, 52 and 68."
