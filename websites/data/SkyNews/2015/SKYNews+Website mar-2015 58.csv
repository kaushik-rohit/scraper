2015-03-02,It was anything but a familiar tune at Leeds Music School.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150302054541/http://news.sky.com/story/1435611/jobless-fall-funds-labours-tuition-fees-cut,"It was anything but a familiar tune at Leeds Music School. Labour leader Ed Miliband telling students and activists with an operatic flourish that tuition fees were... to be reduced by a third from £9,000 to £6,000. It is a policy unloved by the commentariat and by university chiefs. But the Labour leader sees two key benefits, over and above the appeal for young votes. Labour desperately needs young people to be motivated even to register to vote. And he believes his promise can regain political trust at the election lost generally by the totemic broken pledge of this Parliament: Nick Clegg's promise not to raise fees. This is why I invited him to confirm that this new pledge on the same topic would stand irrespective of what deal or what coalition might emerge after the election. Was it cast iron, a red line? ""Yes. Yes. Yes,"" Mr Miliband told me in front of some whooping Labour students. The Lib Dems, who still believe they can remain in Government, privately rubbish the idea that this is a red line. Indeed Vince Cable told me on Sky News on Thursday that ""it was almost complete certainty that if they got into Government they'd abandon this one, because they know perfectly well it’s undeliverable"". Conservatives also criticised the £3bn spending on higher earning future graduates. Labour called the criticisms ""prebuttals"" and unexpectedly increased maintenance grants to less well off students from £3,400 to £3,800. That £200m move was paid for by raising the interest rate on higher earning graduates from 3% to 4%. The rest of the lost fee income will be replaced by government funding raised from three raids on tax breaks for large pension pots. About 300,000 high earners, and high savers (over £30,000 a year in pensions contributions or with pots of over £1m) will fund the £2.7bn. Pensions companies were understandably very concerned about the impact. It would limit tax advantages for pensions of about £30,000. One of the changes, limited tax relief on pensions contributions for those earning over £150,000, was already announced last year. It was earmarked to fund the Compulsory Jobs Guarantee. The annual cost of that Labour policy has fallen from £900m to £300m. Why? Because of the collapse in unemployment. So effectively, Labour are already spending the proceeds of growth, or at least a robust jobs market, under the coalition. The Labour leader made a point of co-presenting this announcement with shadow chancellor Ed Balls. Mr Balls stressed the argument that the system itself was bankrupt, as shown by expected write offs of nearly half of the loans. He attacked the ""scourge of debt"" for students and the taxpayer. Mr Miliband looked like a very happy man today. The commentariat have largely panned his long announced plan to reduce top tuition fees to £6,000. But amongst the pips in the core of his vote - young people - he detects a path to Number 10. And again, it marks a novel route for any prospective prime minister."
2015-03-02,Ed Miliband has unveiled a Labour election pledge to cut student tuition fees by a third by reducing pension tax relief for higher earners.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150302054541/http://news.sky.com/story/1435474/tax-break-cut-to-pay-for-labour-fees-pledge,"Ed Miliband has unveiled a Labour election pledge to cut student tuition fees by a third by reducing pension tax relief for higher earners. Under the party's plans, the cap on undergraduate fees would be reduced from £9,000 to £6,000 per year from September 2016. Mr Miliband told an audience of students in Leeds that the current funding system was landing graduates with debts running into tens of thousands of pounds. He said the coalition Government's student fees policy was ""one of the most expensive broken promises in the history of British politics"". Labour's funding cut would be paid for by a reduction in pension tax relief for higher earners, Mr Miliband said. The lifetime limit on the size of pension pots would be reduced from £1.25m to £1m, while maximum contributions to pension pots will be cut from £40,000 to £30,000. Mr Miliband also said maintenance grants will be increased by £400 a year, saying that Labour is ""determined"" to help students with their living costs. This will apply to those with family incomes of up to £42,000. In a bid to offset criticism the cut in fees would disproportionately benefit wealthier graduates, the interest rate on loans would rise by 1% to 4% for the highest earners. Mr Miliband said: ""The scourge of debt from tuition fees is not only holding back our young people, it is a burden on our country."" He added: ""We're going to reduce the debt on university students. We're going to reduce the debt on taxpayers. ""From September of next year, the next Labour government will reduce tuition fees from £9,000 to £6,000. Meeting our obligations to the next generation. ""It will benefit those starting courses next year. It will benefit those already at university."" But Business Secretary Vince Cable told Sky News: ""It's an absolutely terrible idea that will do great harm to universities. ""Its completely unnecessary because we have got a good system now where universities are properly funded, students who go there don't pay any cash, they pay back later in life in relation to their income. ""The only people who benefit from the Labour proposal will be future graduates on high incomes - the investment bankers of the future. ""It's a very, very retrograde, regressive step that will undermine  higher education."" Conservative Universities Minister Greg Clark dismissed Labour's plan as ""cobbled together"" and warned it would cause ""chaos"". Gallery: Thousands Of Students Join March Demonstrators chant slogans during a student rally in central London ""It's an incompetently framed policy,"" he said. London Mayor and would-be Tory MP Boris Johnson said the Labour plan would be ""absolutely disastrous"" for university finance. Speaking to First News readers and contributors from Sky News' Stand Up Be Counted campaign, he said: ""We've got some of the best universities in the world here in London and four of the top 10 universities they depend on being properly financed. ""The best people to contribute to the financing of those universities are the students who benefit from them - over their lifetimes graduates from universities will earn massively more than people who don’t go to university.""

It was billed as peaceful - but pockets of violence erupted"

The New York Daily News dubbed the actor, who played Captain Kirk in the cult sci-fi series, as ""Captain Jerk"" on Sunday for his no-show. Nimoy died on Friday aged 83. Space station astronaut Terry Virts pays tribute with a Vulcan salute Shatner said on Saturday he could not make the service because he already had plans to appear at a Red Cross ball in Florida. ""I feel really awful,"" the 83-year-old tweeted. ""Here I am doing charity work and one of my dearest friends is being buried."" Shatner shared the image of the Daily News' front page on Twitter and invited people to ""discuss it"". He tweeted: ""I chose to honor a commitment I made months ago to appear at a charitable fundraiser. A lot of money was raised. So here I am; tell me off."" As Twitter users urged him to catch a late-night flight to the West Coast, the actor added: ""One of the other misconceptions seems to be that folks think flights to LAX occur all night long."" He also shared fond memories of Nimoy, who played pointy-eared half-Vulcan Mr Spock in the show.

Shatner led tributes to Nimoy on Friday, saying he had loved his co-star ""like a brother"". Nimoy was beloved for his portrayal of the Starship Enterprise second-in-command to Shatner's Kirk."
2015-03-02,A teenage girl suspected of being a suicide bomber has been beaten to death and her body set on fire at a market in northeastern Nigeria.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150302054541/http://news.sky.com/story/1436499/girl-suicide-bomber-beaten-to-death-and-burned,"A teenage girl suspected of being a suicide bomber has been beaten to death and her body set on fire at a market in northeastern Nigeria. Two girls refused to be searched after arriving at the gate to a vegetable market in Bauchi on Sunday, according to vendor Mohd Adamu. A crowd overpowered one of the girls and discovered she had two bottles strapped to her body. They then clubbed her to death before putting a tyre doused in fuel over her head and setting it alight. A second suspect, also a teenager, was arrested at Muda Lawal, the biggest market in Bauchi. Police Deputy Superintendent Mohammad Haruna said it was unlikely the girl was a suicide bomber as she did not detonate any explosives when she was attacked. He described her as the victim of ""mob action carried out by an irate crowd"". A spate of suicide bombings in Nigeria has been blamed on the Islamist Boko Haram group. Girls as young as 10 have been used to carry explosives during attacks at busy markets and bus stations. Boko Haram has kidnapped hundreds of people during attacks in the northeast of the country. Last week, President Goodluck Jonathan condemned the group for attacking soft targets and claimed the spate of bombings was a retaliation to the Nigerian military's success in regaining towns held by extremists for months. In 2014, around 10,000 people died in Nigeria after Boko Haram attacks, according to the US Council on Foreign Relations. Another 1.5 million have been forced from their homes. A US missionary was kidnapped by masked gunmen after an attack at a school in central Kogi state last week."

The movement was formed in Germany last year and has held regular marches there calling for a restriction in Muslim immigration and the preservation of German culture. Its German acronym means Patriotic Europeans against the Islamisation of the West. Several hundred counter demonstrators turned out to oppose the rally On its Facebook page, the group said: ""We would like to remind everyone that this will be a peaceful rally where people from all walks of life will gather together to unite against extreme Islam, nothing else. ""We all have one main aim and that is to protect our British values and our culture."" Gallery: The Rise Of The Right-Wing, Anti-Islam Political Group Pegida was founded in Dresden, Germany, in October 2014 when 350 people attended a demonstration against what they called the ""Islamification"" of Europe A few hundred yards away an estimated 2,000 counter protesters carrying banners declaring opposition to facism, Islamaphobia and racism shouted insults behind lines of police. MP George Galloway, who was at the rally to protest against it, branded PEGIDA supporters ""right-wing nutters"". PEGIDA demonstrators gave speeches from a podium in the city centre while the song ""There Will Always Be An England"" played from large speakers. One supporter said: ""This is about the problems that are going on in this nation. ""Muslims are not integrating into our society; they want their own laws but we don't want that."" Another supporter was seen carrying the flag of the Greek Golden Dawn party, which has also campaigned against Muslim immigration into southern Greece and Athens. Mr Galloway said: ""It is absolutely extraordinary that a German organisation sets up in the UK - it's not as if there is a lack of right-wing nutter organisations here. ""They have got to be opposed, wherever they are."" Northumbria Police planned a major operation to keep the busy city centre safe for everyone, including football fans ahead of Newcastle United's game against Aston Villa. But fears of widespread trouble did not materialise. There were only minor scuffles as police tried to keep both sides apart. Police said there were five arrests for isolated incidents, and both events passed off smoothly. It is unclear which sides those who were arrested are from. The alleged offences range from assault, to being drunk and disorderly and breach of the peace."

2015-03-02,"The Londoner identified as ""Jihadi John"" told a journalist in 2010 that harassment by British security services had made him fear he was a ""dead man walking"", it has been revealed.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150302054541/http://news.sky.com/story/1436258/mi5-made-emwazi-feel-like-a-dead-man-walking,"The Londoner identified as ""Jihadi John"" told a journalist in 2010 that harassment by British security services had made him fear he was a ""dead man walking"", it has been revealed. Years before his reign of terror in Islamic State videos began, Mohammed Emwazi emailed a reporter to claim that several run-ins with intelligence officials had left him contemplating suicide. The 26-year-old described coming face-to-face with someone who he suspected was a British spy - months after he graduated from the University of Westminster. Emwazi was attempting to sell a laptop when he became suspicious of the mystery buyer, according to messages he sent to a Mail on Sunday reporter. He wrote: ""Sometimes I feel like a dead man walking, not fearing they (MI5) may kill me. ""Rather, fearing that one day, I'll take as many pills as I can so that I will sleep for ever! I just want to get away from these people!"" The correspondence was released on Saturday night - hours after a tranche of messages between Emwazi and a campaign group emerged. He began emailing the CAGE organisation after he was questioned by counter-terrorism officers while attempting to fly from Heathrow to his native Kuwait in 2010 - and claimed the security services were ""stopping him from living his new life"" abroad, where he had secured a job and was getting married. In one message, the graduate wrote: ""I feel like a prisoner, only not in a cage, (but) in London. A person imprisoned and controlled by security service men."" Emwazi appears vulnerable in several of his emails, and asks for advice in complaining to his MP and the Independent Police Complaints Commission about the treatment he had received. After being told by British officials that he would not be allowed to move to Kuwait, he told CAGE: ""I'm not going to give up!! I'm going to wait for my Dad to come back so that we can visit the Kuwaiti embassy in London… going to the embassy myself won't be successful."" The last email that Emwazi sent to CAGE in January 2012 showed no indication of the violent acts of terror he would soon be involved in - and had the subject title: ""Smile, it's me again?! Sorry for the headaches I cause…"" When Emwazi was first unmasked as ""Jihadi John"" earlier this week, representatives from CAGE described him as ""extremely kind and gentle"" and ""the most humble young person we ever knew"". He is believed to be involved in the cold-blooded murders of at least five Western aid workers and journalists who were taken hostage by Islamic State in Syria. They include two Britons: Alan Henning and David Haines. The University of Westminster has been accused of allowing a toxic environment of radical Islam within the institution, a charge it vehemently denies. Emwazi earned a computer programming degree at one of its campuses. Meanwhile, the high school where the militant studied, Quintin Kynaston Academy, is being investigated by the Department for Education - after a Sunday Telegraph report claimed that two other pupils from the north London school had been killed fighting for al Qaeda and al Shabaab. A Government spokeswoman added: ""The allegations about Quintin Kynaston may be historic - and it is clearly a completely different school today - but I'm sure we will look back at evidence from the time as part of this review to see if there are any lessons we can learn for the future."""
2015-03-02,He has been Islamic State's poster boy of horror.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150302054541/http://news.sky.com/story/1434839/behind-the-twisted-appeal-of-jihadi-john,"He has been Islamic State's poster boy of horror. Once dubbed 'Jihadi John', Mohammed Emwazi, a Kuwaiti-born Briton from northwest London, has been named by friends and associates allegedly as the death cult's best known murderer. Sadly, and dangerously, such notoriety serves the purpose of the movement he has joined - demonstrating a sense of invincibility as a purging 'saint' for the cause. Emwazi, if he is ever formally identified as the infamous killer, appears to closely fit and serves the psychological profile which has driven much of Islamic State's appeal. Experts speak of three important characteristics which drive the appeal of IS. There is the notion of ""cognitive closure"". Islamic State's uncompromising theologically driven world perspective in a world of ""unsettling, anxiety inducing uncertainties"" offers men and women, especially those in the West who are from immigrant backgrounds and may feel alienated, an end to the ""cravings for coherence and closure"", according to Professor Arie Kruglanski, from the University of Maryland. Writing on the E-International Relations website Prof Kruglanski, a leading authority on the minds of terrorists, observed that fundamentalism offers people a ""world of good versus evil, saints versus sinners, order versus chaos; a pure universe in black and white admitting no shades of grey. A fundamentalist ideology… offers a future that is predictable and controllable. ""Such a perspective holds particular fascination for confused youths in transitional stages of their lives, who drift like rudderless ships and find themselves torn by conflicting cultural demands."" Emwazi, a computer science graduate from Westminster University, appears to have been restless. He is reported to have been arrested in Tanzania on suspicion of links to al Shabab in Somalia nine years ago. He complained of being interviewed and ""threatened"" by MI5. He sought work in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia but grew up in the gang-blighted parts of Queen's Park in northwest London.  Jihadi ideology removes uncertainty and provides a sense of superiority - so much so that those who do not share its tenets are deemed worthy only of obliteration. Another appeal of IS is that it offers followers a chance at being significant. Emzawi, or Jihadi John, is seen as a hero by himself, his comrades and internet groupies attracted to his brand of bullying machismo. The message from him is ""you too can be a world player, bring war and bloodshed in return for worldly recognition, and end to the 'humiliation' and rewards in heaven following 'martyrdom'. This ""denotes the supreme importance to humans of being noticed, mattering, and deserving honour and esteem"", Prof Kruglanski writes. In recent months, the base instincts of young men and women are also forming part of the IS appeal. Sex is selling their agenda. Young fighters are promised a bride, sex slaves or captured women, while their groupies are lured to Syria by internet images of handsome armed men and the promise of an Islamic life in the arms of a hero. IS has seen recruitment leap from 10,000 to more than 40,000, with 12,000 foreign fighters of whom at least 3,000 hail from Europe. Emwazi is a magnet for IS recruits. His appeal will only end, says Prof Kruglanski, with ""ignominy, an unglamorous death in the desert with no one to care""."

The discovery came as more than 100 friends and family took part in a search across Bristol, where the teenager was last seen over a week ago.  Police said she left her home in Crown Hill, in the St George area of the city, on 19 February with her phone, laptop and tablet computer. Rebecca Watts was last seen on 19 February She did not tell her friends or family where she was going, or take extra clothes. The laptop, a grey Toshiba, has been handed to investigators. The teenager, described as shy, was reported missing by her family at 4pm on February 20. John Galsworthy, Becky's paternal grandfather, said the family were trying to remain strong as the search intensifies. Mr Galsworthy said: ""We are broadening the search. There are groups separate to ours who are going out using their own initiative, going wherever necessary to try and find her. ""We are continuing in the hope there may be something discovered today. We want everyone to keep their eyes and ears open."" Police divers have searched a lake in St George's Park, close to the youngster's home. Dogs and mounted officers have been involved in the hunt and officers from neighbouring force areas have also been drafted in to help. A laptop was found by volunteers scouring areas where Rebecca was last seen The detective leading the hunt has said Rebecca's disappearance was ""totally out of character"". Detective Inspector Richard Ocone said: ""She has not taken anything that would suggest she was going to stay away for a long period of time."" Her father, Darren Galsworthy, has suggested on his Facebook page he fears his daughter may have been attacked. He appealed to any wives or girlfriends who have washed any blood from their loved ones' clothes that cannot be explained to get in touch with police. Police previously said there was ""nothing to suggest"" that Becky had come to harm, despite the fears of the girl's father. A social media campaign using the hashtag #FindBecky has also gathered momentum. Becky is described as 5ft 4in and slim, with long, bright red hair and was wearing a dark navy blue Puffa jacket with fabric sleeves.

At least five people were arrested for public order offences. Superintendent Andrew Carr said: ""This rave was illegal and therefore there are no guarantees that location is safe or that the amount of people who attend are properly managed. ""It is very disappointing that members of the public became hostile to officers and began to throw missiles and damage fences and property. Sadly, four officers have been injured and there were other minor injuries."" Roads around the industrial estate were cordoned off while officers dealt with the rave."

2015-03-02,First-time buyers aged under-40 will be given the chance to buy a starter home at a 20% discount under a new Government scheme.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150302054541/http://news.sky.com/story/1436032/first-time-buyers-get-20-percent-discount-on-homes,"First-time buyers aged under-40 will be given the chance to buy a starter home at a 20% discount under a new Government scheme. Planning rules for under-used brownfield sites will be relaxed from Monday in return for developers using the land to build properties to sell at 80% of the market value. The scheme could save potential buyers tens of thousands of pounds, as the average cost of a first home is currently £218,000. The Prime Minister said the discount ""could be a real game-changer for many aspiring home-owners"". About 45 developers have so far expressed an interest in taking advantage of the move, that would save them around £15,000 per home in obligations. Suggested designs for the new homes have been compiled by a panel including leading architects Sir Terry Farrell and Sir Quinlan Terry based on the best from around the country. They highlighted ""attractive properties that can meet the demands of modern life"". Potential buyers can express interest online now and the discount will apply for five years to prevent anyone seeking to make a quick profit. Mr Cameron said: ""We want to help people who work hard and want to get on in life but have been priced out of the housing market. ""A 20% discount off the price could be a real game-changer for many aspiring home-owners. My message is clear: we are on your side and we will help you fulfil your dream of buying your first home."" Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said: ""The number of first-time buyers is already at a seven-year high and these starter homes... will help even more people realise their dream of home ownership. ""This will also form part of our wider efforts to get the country building again, which have already led to 700,000 new homes being delivered since the end of 2009."" But shadow housing minister Emma Reynolds said it remained unclear how the policy would deliver. She said: ""Warm words from David Cameron about home ownership will ring hollow for those young people and families who have been priced out of home ownership over the past five years. ""This Government has presided over the lowest levels of house building in peacetime since the 1920s and home ownership is at its lowest level for 30 years. ""There is also a record number of young people living at home with their parents in to their twenties and thirties. ""Labour will get at least 200,000 homes built a year by 2020, including badly needed affordable homes, and we will give first-time buyers first call on homes built in local areas of housing growth."""

The University of Westminster has insisted it condemns the promotion of radicalisation and is trying to stop it, after Emwazi was unmasked as the Islamic State militant ""Jihadi John"". The unnamed ex-student said groups active at the university ""created a hostile environment towards non-Muslims, were anti-Israeli and homophobic remarks were rampant at the campus"". He added: ""If this toxic environment endured after I left I am not surprised a 'normal' young Muslim struggling to find identity became radicalised."" The former student added the university was ""excellent"" but ""their tolerance was abused by people who played a double game"". The University said in a statement: ""We condemn the promotion of radicalisation, terrorism and violence or threats against any member of our community. ""We have strict policies to promote tolerance among our 20,000 student community, who come to study from over 150 nations. ""Any student found to be engaging in radicalised activity or intimidating others would be subject to disciplinary procedures."" Emwazi, 26, studied at the university between 2006 and 2009, earning a computer programming degree. Earlier, an ex-school pupil of Emwazi said he seemed peculiar and violent as a youngster. The man, who does not want to be named, also told Sky News that Emwazi ""got into some fights"" and smoked, but there was nothing in his secondary school that could have left him radicalised. However, he said there was potential for him to be groomed because he kept himself to himself and did not make eye contact.

The school said in a statement it was ""shocked and sickened"" that one of their alumni had become involved in terrorism. MI5 has reportedly questioned Emwazi's former teachers following on from his identification. The former pupil said there was nothing to suggest Emwazi was religious during his teenage years. ""There was something peculiar about him in that he was violent but he wasn't someone who was loud, who talked in a provocative way,"" the ex-schoolmate said. He believes the IS militant's education beyond secondary school may be responsible for his transformation into a cold-blooded killer. In the same year Emwazi graduated, he was reportedly questioned by an MI5 officer in Amsterdam and was accused of attempting to travel to Somalia to join a terror group. A former reviewer of UK terrorism legislation has suggested Emwazi might have been prevented from joining IS had restrictions on suspects not been relaxed. Lib Dem peer Lord Carlile told Sky News: ""Had control orders been in place, in my review there is a realistic prospect that Mohammed Emwazi and at least two of his associates would have been the subject of control orders with a compulsory relocation."" Former shadow home secretary David Davis said the revelation that Emwazi had been on the authorities' radar showed the approach of MI5 was ""ineffective"". But current Home Secretary Theresa May rallied to the defence of the security and intelligence services, calling them ""true heroes"". The Home Office said: ""Control orders were not working and were being struck down by the courts. ""TPIMs (Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures) have been endorsed by the courts, counter-terrorism reviewers, the police, and the Security Service."""
2015-03-02,"Energy price comparison websites have been ""duping"" customers into switching to deals that are not the cheapest on the market and should pay them compensation, a group of MPs have said.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150302054541/http://news.sky.com/story/1435862/customers-duped-by-energy-switching-deals,"Energy price comparison websites have been ""duping"" customers into switching to deals that are not the cheapest on the market and should pay them compensation, a group of MPs have said. The Energy and Climate Change Committee said some sites had used misleading language to dupe consumers into options that only displayed commission-earning deals. It has called on energy watchdog Ofgem to consider requiring price comparison sites to disclose the amount of commission received for each switch at the point of sale. Representatives of the ""big five"" sites told MPs they earn up to £30 in commission every time a customer switches to a participating provider, or up to £60 when a customer switches both their gas and electricity accounts. Committee chairman Tim Yeo said: ""Consumers trust price comparison services to help them switch to the best energy deals available on the market. ""But some energy price comparison sites have been behaving more like backstreet market traders than the trustworthy consumer champions they make themselves out to be in adverts on TV. ""Some comparison sites have used misleading language to dupe consumers into opting for default options that only display commission-earning deals. And others have previously gone so far as to conceal deals that do not earn them commission behind multiple drop-down web options."" He added: ""As an immediate and essential first step towards rebuilding confidence, the companies should compensate any consumers who have been encouraged to switch to tariffs that may not have been the cheapest or most appropriate for their needs. ""We have no objection to commission being paid by suppliers to price comparison websites as long as the arrangements are clearly disclosed."" Earlier this month, uSwitch told the committee it would compensate consumers who had been misled into signing up for an energy tariff that was more expensive than others available. Its chief executive Steve Weller told the committee he was ""sincerely disappointed"" that a customer was told by his call centre that the cheapest deal available to him was with First Utility, when it was in fact with extraenergy for more than £60 less."

Robert Ebner-Statt, 9, had to tell Boris Johnson that it was two of his city's teams - Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur - playing in the Capital One league cup final at Wembley. That was despite the Conservative politician's claim that ""I support all London clubs, I levitate"". Mr Johnson described the PM as 'very, very competent' He added that for ""some reason I cannot fathom, my son's support Newcastle Utd"". Mr Johnson came unstuck over football during a grilling by children as part of Hotseat - a collaboration between Sky News and the national newspaper for young people, First News. During the session he answered questions about terrorism, education policy, obesity, his political ambitions and much more. At one point, Mr Johnson revealed that he gave lorry drivers ""a piece of his mind"" if they sounded their horn at him while cycling, because it made him ""see red"". While previous Hotseat guests, Chancellor George Osborne and Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, refused to answer basic timetables questions, Mr Johnson was asked about a different subject - Latin. Sophia Hindmarsh, 10, tried to play on rumours that Mr Johnson would like to become Prime Minister, by asking him to translate ""Princeps Esse Velim"" (I want to be leader). Smiling, Mr Johnson quickly replied, ""I know what you are trying to get me to say,"" and instead hit back with ""Volo David Cameronem esse principem"" - which he said meant ""I want David Cameron to be Prime Minister."" It was not his only defence of the Conservative leader. When asked if he wanted to be Prime Minister, he said: ""I think Dave is going to get back in. I think it is more likely, frankly, that one of you will take over in some distant future than I will."" He described Mr Cameron as ""very, very competent"" and an ""expert leader of the country"". The Mayor also spoke on a range of other issues, including: Immigration and second jobs... He defended immigration, as long as people were not ""skiving, idling, loafing, leeching"", and he entered into the debate about MPs' salaries and second jobs. Mr Johnson claimed politicians should certainly not ""be going around trying to take more dosh off the taxpayer"". Ministers, he added, should not be doing private consultancy work on the side. But he insisted that MPs were not ""twerps"" - well ""not all twerps"". Jihadis and tuition fees... Mr Johnson told the children that the thing he most wanted to change in the world was children being lured into what he called ""Jihadi nonsense"". And he criticised Labour's policy to cut tuition fees, arguing that it was right for graduates who ""earn massively more than people who don't go to university"" to pay for their education. Parenting, regrets and weird gifts... The young people asked Mr Johnson what sort of dad he was - ""embarrassing""; his biggest personal and political regrets - ""my failure to get anywhere as a rockstar""; his weirdest gift - ""a banquet of camel""; and his celebrity crushes - to which he strangely responded ""Basil Brush"". Bouts of road rage... On road rage, he said: ""When lorry drivers come up behind me and I'm cycling innocently, keeping to my side of the road and they decide because they are so big and their lorry is so powerful and they just want to clear me out of the road and they hoot aggressively then I do see red a bit. I do."" He admitted entering into altercations if he pulled up beside a lorry driver who had done that at the traffic lights. The embarrassing zip wire... He also talked about the famous incident when he got stuck on a zip-wire, describing his ""embarrassment and personal discomfiture"". He said he was accompanied by a bodyguard called Carl, who used to work for Tony Blair. When he asked him for help, he said Carl simply took out a mobile phone and ""took a photograph of my rear end"". The Boris Factor... The young people also asked what the ""Boris factor"" was, to which he replied it was doing your best and turning up. ""My strong advice to you, turning up is about 90% of success in life,"" he said. Healthy-ish eating… On obesity, he said it was right to encourage children to eat healthily by limiting their options. He tried to compare an unhealthy option like pizza and chips to a healthy option - but took some time to think of one, finally landing on ratatouille and salad. Asked which he would choose, he said: ""I would probably have both""."

Showing him with a goatee beard and wearing a Pittsburgh Pirates baseball cap, the image is revealed in student records from his time at the University of Westminster. It comes after the 26-year-old who became the masked face of the notorious terror organisation was identified as the figure seen in several videos of hostages being beheaded. Sky News can also exclusively reveal details of Emwazi's academic achievements during his stint at the university in London's Cavendish campus, between 2006 and 2009. According to the document, he passed all but two of the modules in his Information Systems with Business Management degree, for which he was awarded a lower second honours (2:2).

Sky News has exclusively obtained his student record The record shows he was awarded a ""condoned credit; retake"" status for modules in Business Information Systems and Managing Business Organisations. Earlier, a photograph had emerged showing the smiling face of a eight-year-old Emwazi sitting with classmates at St Magdalene's Church of England School in west London. An unnamed classmate told The Sun newspaper that  Emwazi, who reportedly came from a devout family, was the only Muslim in the class and would demonstrate Arabic writing to the class. After completing his degree he went on to become a computer programmer before travelling to Syria in 2013 and later joining IS. Advocacy group CAGE said the Kuwaiti-born Briton was ""extremely kind"" and ""extremely gentle"" but had been harassed by the UK security services. Research director Asim Qureshi said Emwazi's family was ""in utter shock"" that the ""beautiful young man"" had joined the militant group. Prime Minister David Cameron defended the security services, insisting Britain will do ""everything we can"" to bring terrorists to justice. ""They are having to make incredibly difficult judgements, and I think basically they make very good judgements on our behalf,"" he said."

The move comes as a surprise as the 30-year-old Prince is a passionate member of the Armed Forces, who appeared to be focused on a long career serving as an Army officer.  He served two tours of duty in Afghanistan. An Army spokesperson said: ""We would not comment on the future careers of any of our soldiers and officers."" Kensington Palace would not comment on the news. It said in a statement: ""Prince Harry is currently focused on his work supporting the Ministry of Defence's recovery capability programme to ensure those who are wounded, injured or sick have appropriate recovery plans and the necessary support they require."" The statement said the current job is ""a natural progression from the work he did organising the Invictus Games"". Sky's Defence Correspondent Alistair Bunkall said Prince Harry had a ""pretty distinguished"" career within the Armed Forces. ""This is a natural time for Prince Harry to leave the Army. He could be expected to be promoted from Captain to Major next year, at which point he would undertake a nine-month course at the Staff College in Shrivenham. This sets you up for a long career in the Army. Gallery: Life In Afghanistan For Pilot Prince Prince Harry has given the media unprecedented access to his second tour in Afghanistan. Click through the gallery to see pictures of the pilot prince in Helmand... ""It is therefore a moment when a lot of young officers find themselves at a junction: to stay or leave and pursue something else."" In late 2007, Prince Harry undertook a six-month tour of duty fighting the Taliban in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, operating as a forward air controller. His tour was cut short after his presence in the front line was revealed by an Australian newspaper. In September 2012, he returned to Afghanistan for a  20-week stint that gave him the chance to use his Apache flying skills and head out on operations in his role as co-pilot gunner. In January 2014, he swapped his helicopter role for an Army desk job, organising ceremonial events. London's Evening Standard, which first reported the news, said Harry plans to focus on his charity work and aims to spend ""a significant period abroad"" on field projects in Africa. Before his active military duties end, the Prince is expected to move to Australia for ""several weeks"", seconded to serve with units there, according to the newspaper. Later he will spend time in New Zealand but not be involved with the military there, it said."
2015-03-02,Police have been given new powers to catch motorists driving under the influence of drugs.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150302054541/http://news.sky.com/story/1436666/drug-drivers-beware-new-law-comes-into-force,"Police have been given new powers to catch motorists driving under the influence of drugs. Officers will no longer have to prove a driver was too impaired to be behind the wheel, just that they had an illegal level of substances in their system. They will be able to prosecute drivers in England and Wales caught exceeding new legal limits for how much of a substance motorists can have in their system while driving. The levels for the illegal drugs, which include heroin, cocaine and cannabis, virtually mean there will be zero tolerance for drivers apprehended with these substances in their system. The prescription drugs for which legal levels have been set include morphine, methadone and diazepam. People using these drugs within recommended amounts will not be penalised. Police will be able to use ""drugalysers"" to screen for cannabis and cocaine at the roadside. They will also be able to test for these and other drugs, including ecstasy, LSD, ketamine and heroin, at a police station, even if a driver passes the roadside check. Drivers who test positive will face a criminal record, loss of their licence for at least a year, and a fine of up to £5,000. Around 200 people are killed on roads each year in Britain because of drug drivers. Road Safety Minister Robert Goodwill said: ""This new law will save lives. We know driving under the influence of drugs is extremely dangerous; it devastates families and ruins lives. ""The Government's message is clear - if you take drugs and drive, you are endangering yourself and others and you risk losing your licence and a conviction."""
2015-03-02,Rail unions are planning to stage protests along the East Coast Main Line later - marking the day before the route is re-privatised by the Government.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150302054541/http://news.sky.com/story/1435872/unions-protest-as-east-coast-line-goes-private,"Rail unions are planning to stage protests along the East Coast Main Line later - marking the day before the route is re-privatised by the Government. The Rail, Maritime and Transport union is organising gatherings in London, Doncaster and Edinburgh to protest against the franchise being handed over to Virgin and Stagecoach. Its general secretary, Mick Cash, has described the re-privatisation as an act of ""industrial vandalism"" - and claims the new private operators are solely motivated by profit. Citing research which suggests that 70% of Britons want the whole rail network to be re-nationalised, he said: ""Six years ago, the East Coast Main Line collapsed into chaos when National Express threw the keys back because they couldn't extract enough profit. That followed an earlier spectacular private sector failure on the line when Sea Containers went bust. ""It was left to the public sector to not only rescue this vital north-south rail link from total meltdown, but to turn around its performance and to start handing hundreds of millions of pounds back to the taxpayer - in contrast to rip-off private companies."" Virgin and Stagecoach already operate services from London to Scotland on the West Coast Main Line. In proposals for its eight years running the East Coast franchise, the consortium has pledged to launch 23 new daily services from the capital, and offer direct links to Huddersfield, Middlesbrough, Sunderland, Dewsbury and Thornaby. It also hopes to offer 3,100 additional seats during the morning rush-hour by 2020, by introducing 65 state-of-the-art Intercity Express trains to the fleet. The Department for Transport has rejected the RMT's claims, and said the private sector has ""helped to transform our rail network into a real success story"". ""We are confident that the new East Coast franchise gives the best deal for passengers. It will provide more seats, more services, new trains and over £140m of investment along the route. In addition, more than £3bn will be paid to taxpayers,"" a spokesman added."
2015-03-02,Sir Cliff Richard's lawyers have criticised the Home Affairs Committee over the release of a letter about the police investigation into sex abuse claims against the singer.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150302054541/http://news.sky.com/story/1435706/sir-cliff-lawyers-hit-out-over-police-letter,"Sir Cliff Richard's lawyers have criticised the Home Affairs Committee over the release of a letter about the police investigation into sex abuse claims against the singer. Sir Cliff's representatives said the disclosure was ""unfair"" and caused him ""a further round of unnecessary and extremely damaging media coverage with no due process"". New developments in the case were revealed earlier this week in the letter, which was from South Yorkshire Police (SYP) to committee chairman Keith Vaz. The letter revealed the police investigation into Sir Cliff has ""increased significantly in size"" and involves ""more than one allegation"". But the complaint from Michael Simkins Solicitors to Mr Vaz says: ""Plainly, it was not necessary for the SYP Letter to be published on any urgent basis, if at all. ""As a direct result of the decision of the committee to publish the SYP Letter, and to proactively send it to media organisations, our client has been exposed to a further round of unnecessary and extremely damaging media coverage, with no due process. ""Our client had no opportunity to comment or make submissions to the Committee in advance of publication, but had he been able to do so, the damage that has since been caused by the Committee's actions and by the SYP Letter would, most likely, have been avoided."" Sir Cliff was questioned and his Berkshire home raided last August The firm also disputed the claim made in the police letter that the singer's lawyers had received verbal updates from detectives ""about once a fortnight"". ""It does, of course, remain the case that our client has neither been arrested nor charged with any offence and that he denies any wrongdoing whatsoever,"" the lawyers' letter continued. ""In addition to not knowing much about the claims of new allegations, our client has not, of course, been interviewed about them. ""Extensive media interest was hardly dampened by the Chairman of the Committee who appeared on television to discuss the contents of the SYP Letter on the same evening of its release. ""It is manifestly unfair to our client that he has again been put in a situation where speculation and rumours are rife, where he cannot defend himself because he is the subject of an investigation, and where third parties appear to know more than he does. ""It is not how a criminal investigation should be conducted."" Referring to the suggestion in the police letter that the investigation has ""increased significantly"", the lawyers write: ""This phrasing is curious and seems to us to be - at best - a loose use of language and at worst to be unnecessarily emotive."" In a letter of response, Mr Vaz said it is normal procedure to publish all evidence put before the committee. ""Unless a letter or document is marked private and confidential it has always been the policy of the committee to publish whatever we receive.  ""South Yorkshire Police specifically asked for the redaction of certain parts of the letter before publication."" It continued: ""In the past, the committee has written to ask for your comments on the matters that have been raised by both South Yorkshire Police and the BBC. ""You have previously declined to do so."" Claims that the investigation has expanded come after the 74-year-old was questioned last August by detectives looking at allegations of a sexual offence against a boy in 1985, which he vehemently denies."

The decision by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) followed complaints a card offering a ""30-day free trial"" was not sufficiently clear that a paid subscription would start automatically if not cancelled during the trial period. They also said the ad for the instant video element of Prime did not state the cost of the subscription. The letter read: ""Dear (recipient's name), I'm sending you this letter because I want you to know that you are eligible for a free trial of Amazon Prime ... Start your 30-day free trial today and watch as much as you want ... That's all there is to it ..."" Small text at the bottom of the letter said: ""Paid subscription starts automatically after free trial unless cancelled."" Amazon Europe said the ad repeatedly said the ""free"" element of the trial was time-limited and, on all but one of the occasions on which the word ""free"" was used, it was preceded by ""30-day"". The company also pointed out it was common practice for free trials for services to convert to a paid subscription unless cancelled, and that consumers would understand and expect that they had to cancel within the free period if they did not want to start a paid subscription. The ASA decided a paid subscription starting automatically at the end of the trial was a commitment and a significant condition of the ""free"" offer, and should therefore be made clear to consumers. It said: ""We did not consider that it was sufficient to include the information about the automatic paid subscription in the small print of the ad only and therefore did not consider that that information was sufficiently prominent to make clear the extent of the commitment consumers must make to take advantage of the offer. ""We concluded the ad was likely to mislead."" The ASA said the ad was also misleading for not saying that a subscription to Amazon Prime cost £79 a year or that the charge for Amazon Prime Instant Video was £5.99 a month. It ruled that the ad must not appear again in its current form."

Emergency services attended but he was pronounced dead at the scene. CCTV of the attack showed the bikes belonging to Alan's friends were taken by a number of men.

The Chancellor George Osborne said the sale, reported by Sky News on Tuesday night, represented a ""fantastic deal"" for the taxpayer and the money would be used to draw down debts and on core infrastructure. However, rail unions accused him of putting short term financial gain ahead of the travelling public. Under the agreement Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec (CDPQ) and Hermes Infrastructure have agreed to acquire the Government's 40% holding for £585.1m. In addition, Eurostar will redeem the Government's preference share, raising a further £172m. The stake in the cross-channel rail link operator was put up for sale last autumn as part of a plan to raise £20bn from asset sales by the end of the decade. Eurostar, which launched its inaugural service in 1994, has seen a surge in demand, with more than 10 million passengers travelling on its trains in 2013 alone. Among the other bidders for the Eurostar stake were 3i, the private equity firm, a division of the French bank Credit Agricole and an arm of the Singaporean government. The remainder of Eurostar is owned by SNCF, the French state-owned rail operator, which controls 55%, and the Belgian government. Mr Osborne said it was ""a fantastic deal"" for UK taxpayers that exceeds expectations. ""Investing in the best quality infrastructure for Britain, getting the best value for money for the taxpayer and tackling our country's debts are key parts of our long term economic plan, and in today's agreement, we are delivering on all three"".

Hermes Infrastructure - part of Hermes Investment Management - is a UK-based fund managing approximately £3bn on behalf of clients. Mick Cash, leader of the RMT union, said: ""The news today that the Government has reached a deal to sell off the British slice of our cash-generating Eurostar assets before the May election is pure Thatcherite industrial vandalism that makes us a laughing stock across Europe"". Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, added: ""The reason that France and Belgium already own the majority stake in Eurostar is that they believe in running a publicly owned railway for the benefit of everybody. ""One-eyed Osborne, on the other hand, prefers the private English model where fat cat bosses are at the front of the queue, way ahead of the passengers""."

The pair, who are aged 28 and 21, are believed to have been arrested on Saturday on suspicion of kidnap and later re-arrested on suspicion of murder. Avon and Somerset Police said on Wednesday that Ms Phillips was taken to hospital overnight after feeling unwell in custody. She was seen by a doctor and taken back into custody a short while later. Becky disappeared from her home in Crown Hill, in the St George area of Bristol, on 19 February. Body parts were found at a house in the Barton Hill area of the city, close to the home of Mr Matthews and Ms Phillips, which has also been examined by forensic experts. However, police said formal identification procedures have not yet been completed. On Tuesday, Avon and Somerset police revealed four other men, two aged 29 and two aged 23, and a 23-year-old woman, had been arrested on suspicion of helping an offender. Officers were granted a further 24 hours to question the five by a magistrate on Wednesday. They all remain in custody. Becky's aunt, Sarah Broom, wrote on Facebook: ""So today my brother got his baby girl back - 12 days of pure hell filled with heartache. ""He is completely and utterly broken and there is nothing in this world of comfort to him - how does a parent ever recover from this? How can a family?

2015-03-04,It was anything but a familiar tune at Leeds Music School.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150304182224/http://news.sky.com/story/1435611/jobless-fall-funds-labours-tuition-fees-cut,"It was anything but a familiar tune at Leeds Music School. Labour leader Ed Miliband telling students and activists with an operatic flourish that tuition fees were... to be reduced by a third from £9,000 to £6,000. It is a policy unloved by the commentariat and by university chiefs. But the Labour leader sees two key benefits, over and above the appeal for young votes. Labour desperately needs young people to be motivated even to register to vote. And he believes his promise can regain political trust at the election lost generally by the totemic broken pledge of this Parliament: Nick Clegg's promise not to raise fees. This is why I invited him to confirm that this new pledge on the same topic would stand irrespective of what deal or what coalition might emerge after the election. Was it cast iron, a red line? ""Yes. Yes. Yes,"" Mr Miliband told me in front of some whooping Labour students. The Lib Dems, who still believe they can remain in Government, privately rubbish the idea that this is a red line. Indeed Vince Cable told me on Sky News on Thursday that ""it was almost complete certainty that if they got into Government they'd abandon this one, because they know perfectly well it’s undeliverable"". Conservatives also criticised the £3bn spending on higher earning future graduates. Labour called the criticisms ""prebuttals"" and unexpectedly increased maintenance grants to less well off students from £3,400 to £3,800. That £200m move was paid for by raising the interest rate on higher earning graduates from 3% to 4%. The rest of the lost fee income will be replaced by government funding raised from three raids on tax breaks for large pension pots. About 300,000 high earners, and high savers (over £30,000 a year in pensions contributions or with pots of over £1m) will fund the £2.7bn. Pensions companies were understandably very concerned about the impact. It would limit tax advantages for pensions of about £30,000. One of the changes, limited tax relief on pensions contributions for those earning over £150,000, was already announced last year. It was earmarked to fund the Compulsory Jobs Guarantee. The annual cost of that Labour policy has fallen from £900m to £300m. Why? Because of the collapse in unemployment. So effectively, Labour are already spending the proceeds of growth, or at least a robust jobs market, under the coalition. The Labour leader made a point of co-presenting this announcement with shadow chancellor Ed Balls. Mr Balls stressed the argument that the system itself was bankrupt, as shown by expected write offs of nearly half of the loans. He attacked the ""scourge of debt"" for students and the taxpayer. Mr Miliband looked like a very happy man today. The commentariat have largely panned his long announced plan to reduce top tuition fees to £6,000. But amongst the pips in the core of his vote - young people - he detects a path to Number 10. And again, it marks a novel route for any prospective prime minister."

Konstandinos Erik Scurfield, a former Royal Marine, was fighting alongside Kurdish YPG forces in the northern province of Hasakah. A statement from the family, said: ""We are devastated to confirm the death of our son Konstandinos Erik Scurfield in Syria where he went to support the forces opposing Islamic State.  ""His flame might have burned briefly but it burned brightly with love, courage, conviction and honour and we are very proud of him."" Konstandinos reportedly died in a mortar attack. Pic: YPG Earlier, his mother, Viki Scurfield, told Sky News the family were ""reeling"" and struggling to ""get our heads round everything"". Neighbours said the lights had been on all night at the family's house in Royston, a village on the edge of Barnsley. The YPG has contacted the family about repatriating his body to the UK, according to Sky sources, but have also offered to bury him as one of their own at a special burial site. It is understood the 25-year-old died on 2 March and had been fighting alongside the Kurds since the start of December. Kurdish rights activist Mark Campbell told Sky he had broken news of the man's death to his family. ""To be honest it was a harrowing phone call,"" he said. ""There were three questions really his mother wanted to know immediately... ""She wanted to know if there's a body - and there is. She wanted to know when he died - he died yesterday. And she wanted to know if he died in combat - which he had."" Mr Scurfield was reportedly fatally wounded in a mortar attack during fighting near the town of Tal Barak. Jordan Matson, a former US soldier believed to be fighting with the Kurds, described him on Facebook as a ""disciplined warrior"". He wrote: ""Kosta volunteered for every attack and guard duty opportunity. He wanted nothing more than to bring the fight to the enemy. ""I'm going to carry on your legacy, brother, I will never forget you. I love you, man. Save me a place up there, big guy."" Barnsley MP Dan Jarvis told Sky News he believed Mr Scurfield had gone to Syria to provide humanitarian help and for ""honourable reasons"". ""My understanding is that he had very significant ideological concerns about what is happening, about the actions Islamic State were taking in the region, and he wanted to make a contribution. ""He went there to make a humanitarian contribution, he didn't go there to fight, he provided medical assistance."" Rami Abdulrahman, the head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said just over 100 Westerners had joined Kurdish forces in Syria from countries including the US, France, Spain and the Netherlands. Their numbers are small in comparison with those foreign recruits who have joined IS and other hardline groups. An Australian man fighting with Kurdish forces was killed in the country last week, the Observatory and a Kurdish source said."

In a damning report, Ofsted inspectors said they found ""too much complacency"" in non-selective state schools, with the cleverest students not being pushed to achieve their full potential. This was in contrast to their counterparts at grammar or private schools. The study contrasted the situation with that in selective schools The most able youngsters were left ""treading water"", while there had been ""disappointing"" progress in tackling previously identified problems of low expectations, unchallenging work and classroom disruption, found the report. Inspectors pointed to exam results where promising academic achievement at primary school was not matched at GCSE level in English and maths. The report said: ""Our most able students in non-selective schools are still not being challenged to achieve the highest levels of scholarship."" It added: ""Not only did many of the most able students spoken to during this survey say they felt unchallenged by the teaching they received, they often said that low-level disruptive behaviour from other pupils affected their learning."" The critical report also found bright students, particularly from poorer backgrounds, were not getting appropriate advice in planning their futures. Inspectors said it was ""worrying"" in four of the schools visited the most able students were not being encouraged to apply to top universities. Sean Harford, Ofsted's national director of schools, said: ""This report has focused particularly on those identified as the most able. ""While inspectors found pockets of excellence, too many of these children are not being challenged sufficiently - and thousands of highly-performing primary pupils are not realising their early promise when they move to secondary school."" ""I hope school leaders see this report as a call to action - and raise the bar higher for their most able pupils, so that they can reach their full potential."" Ofsted's report was based on visits to 40 non-selective secondaries and 10 primaries, as well as surveys and interviews. Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ""The secondary sector has been subject to massive structural change over the past few years. ""It's neither sensible nor accurate to accuse secondary schools of failure. The system itself is getting in the way of success."" A Department for Education spokesman said: ""Our plan for education is designed to shine a bright light on schools which are coasting, or letting the best and brightest fall by the wayside."""

The money has been accepted by PC Toby Rowland as settlement of his libel action against the former Government whip Andrew Mitchell. The police officer launched the case after Mr Mitchell accused him of lying in his account of a row between the two of them at the gates of Downing Street in September 2012. PC Rowland, a member of the Diplomatic Protection Group, said Mr Mitchell had referred to officers as ""f****** plebs"" but the Tory MP said the police officer was ""not telling the truth"". Plebgate: a costly row between two men over riding a bike in Downing Street However, a judge at the High Court in November found that in all probability the former chief whip had used the ""politically toxic"" phrase during the argument over whether Mr Mitchell should be allowed to ride his bike through the gates of Downing Street. Mr Mitchell lost his libel claim against News Group Newspapers for a story about the incident in The Sun. He was ordered to pay £300,000 in damages and it was estimated that fighting his case had cost him around £3m. Speaking in the High Court today, PC Rowland's lawyer, Jeremy Clarke-Williams, said that since the judgment in November, Mr Mitchell ""has abandoned the other defences he had raised to my client's claim and consequently terms of settlement have been agreed"". He added: ""Pc Rowland never felt that the events in Downing Street were anything more than a minor incident. ""He was not responsible for the publicity which followed and would have much preferred that the whole matter had never entered the public domain. ""He now simply wishes to be left in peace to continue his police career."" Neither Mr Mitchell, who was forced to resign over the issue, nor PC Rowland was in court for the hearing."
2015-03-04,"Home is where the heart is, but these days it might also be your pension plan, a crippling millstone around your neck, or the thing you have to share with your parents until your mid-40s.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150304182224/http://news.sky.com/story/1436932/political-parties-wake-up-to-housing-crisis,"Home is where the heart is, but these days it might also be your pension plan, a crippling millstone around your neck, or the thing you have to share with your parents until your mid-40s. Ten years ago 59% of 25 to 34-year-olds owned their own home, the figure today is 36%. The reason is that house prices have soared compared to income, partly due to a shortage of new affordable homes along with the growing population. Hence - this is a huge election issue that plays into other arguments about economic growth, the cost of living crisis and immigration. The Conservatives have announced that their answer is to build 200,000 cut-price homes by 2020. They will offer first time buyers who are under 40 years-old a 20% reduction off the market rate - a discount the buyer would only have to hand back if they sell the property in the first five years. David Cameron promises these won't be ""rabbit hutches"" or ""shoeboxes"" but ""decent, well-built homes"". But who picks up the 20% shortfall? It was a question the party Chairman Grant Shapps was evasive about on Sky News when he was interviewed by Dermot Murnaghan on Sunday. However, a Number 10 spokesman explained that they will make it easier for developers to build on certain sites. He said: ""The key is that by removing the Section 106 requirement re social housing it will increase the number of sites that are viable."" So if, for example, to build 100 homes the original requirement was that 60 homes must be sold at market-value and 40 would be social housing, in the next government it could be 60 market-value, 20 Starter homes and 20 social housing properties.  Effectively, the 20% reduction homes cut into the number of social homes. The Tory argument is that without the change none of the homes would be built. Ed Miliband dismisses the plan as ""uncosted, unfunded… pie in the sky"". Labour says it will be building 200,000 homes a year by 2020 and that the party will tackle ""long-standing problems in the housing market which have caused a decline in construction capacity."" The party wants to get the public sector building more properties and force private development companies that own land not to ""bank it"", but get on and develop it, by introducing ""use it or lose it"" powers. Labour will also introduce plans to give priority to first-time buyers - but not the 20% reduction. In tandem with this, the party is looking to help ""generation rent"" by legislating to ensure landlords offer three-year tenancy agreements with a ceiling on the amount of rent they are allowed to charge. It is a classic market intervention policy from Ed Miliband, as he has shown with his proposed cap on energy bills, and once again it sets the two parties apart in their strategy for dealing with a problem. The Conservative instinct is to help developers create a larger market place so more people can own their homes, the Labour party instinctively thinking about tenants and how to put a cap on their outgoings. Housing doesn't traditionally hold the same electoral weight as economic policy, the NHS or education - but in many constituencies, especially metropolitan ones, many MPs fighting on the ground say housing is the number one issue. All the parties are now waking up to this."
2015-03-04,A Sky News investigation has led to calls for the NHS to explain why it appears to be wasting millions of pounds sending cancer patients to the United States instead of Europe for treatment that is not yet available in the UK.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150304182224/http://news.sky.com/story/1438059/nhs-quizzed-over-proton-beam-cancer-therapy,"By David Bowden, Senior Correspondent A Sky News investigation has led to calls for the NHS to explain why it appears to be wasting millions of pounds sending cancer patients to the United States instead of Europe for treatment that is not yet available in the UK. Some £250m has been set aside to develop two proton therapy centres in Britain, but they will not be up and running until at least 2018. In the meantime, more than 90% of people approved for proton therapy are sent to America where it can cost twice as much as European centres. Ashya King's parents took their son to Prague for proton treatment Critics argue the money saved could be used to fund more patients' potentially life-saving treatment. Two-year-old Freya Bevan, from South Wales, had brain surgery to remove a tumour and needs radiotherapy to continue her treatment. Her family and doctors wanted her to go to America for proton beam therapy, but after a nine-week wait for a decision, the NHS in Wales refused. While the final decision was taken by the NHS in Wales, the central panel to which all proton requests are referred is overseen by NHS England. The treatment, according to the family, will cost £130,000 and is now being paid for by a charity. But some experts believe it could have been provided in Europe at a fraction of the cost and without the need for Freya to fly across the Atlantic. Her case has similarities to that of Ashya King, who made worldwide headlines when his parents defied doctors in Southampton and took him for proton treatment in Prague sparking a Europe-wide manhunt in the process. Freya's mum, Katherine, said she also seriously considered fleeing to the Czech Republic before the charity stepped in. ""Many times I could've run away to Prague or anywhere just to get the treatment, any parent will want the best treatment they can for their child,"" she said. The Procure Centre in Oklahoma is one of two in the US where the NHS pays for proton therapy. The other is in Jacksonville, Florida . A third centre in Switzerland is also approved, but according to figures given in a parliamentary answer by Conservative Health Minister Jane Ellison, none of the 124 patients sent abroad for proton therapy last year went anywhere but the US. Questions are now being asked about the commissioning process and why nine out of 10 patients the NHS  funded in the past five years were sent to the US, where the full cost of treatment, accommodation and travel can run to more than £100,000 when there are facilities closer and cheaper in Europe. Senior Labour backbencher Roger Godsiff said it is ""ludicrous"" and wants answers from the Government. The MP said: ""If we can save some money by getting people who need this very specialist treatment, treated in a country at half the price of America then we should be doing that."" One of his own constituents, Juliette Harrison from Birmingham, was also refused NHS funding for proton therapy to treat her brain tumour. She paid £37,000 herself to go to the centre in Prague. She said she could not afford to go to the US and also believed her health would have suffered making such a long trip. ""If you are diagnosed with something like that then you shouldn't be subjected to a huge plane flight, not only is there the long journey , but I personally think they are putting people at risk,"" she said. NHS England said it selected providers using a series of criteria, including clinical experience, spoken English, price and waiting times. According to NHS England the average cost of treatment is £75,000 and in the year 2012/2013, £8.26m was spent in total. It refused to make anyone available to be interviewed by Sky News, but said in a statement: ""We have no plans to expand our overseas programme to any other centres at this time."" Sky News has seen a letter sent to Dame Barbara Hakin, national commissioning director for NHS England, by Iva Tatounova, strategy director for the treatment centre in the Czech Republic. In it she wrote: ""We have had a growing number of requests for treatment here in Prague ( self-payers) and, I must say, also a lot of unhappy patients and parents with sick children, who would be eligible for proton therapy, but NHS doctors do not want to recommend it since we do not have a contract. ""Bureaucracy, therefore, is a barrier between the patient and the best possible care."" But the response from Dame Barbara's department said NHS England was not currently looking for any other providers. Ms Tatounova said no one from the NHS had ever been to see their facilities in Prague."
2015-03-04,Prince William's trip to China has ended with embarrassment after he visited an animal sanctuary where elephants are forced to perform for tourists nearby.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150304182224/http://news.sky.com/story/1438224/embarrassment-for-prince-at-elephant-sanctuary,"By Mark Stone, Asia Correspondent Prince William's trip to China has ended with embarrassment after he visited an animal sanctuary where elephants are forced to perform for tourists nearby. At the same moment that the Prince was being photographed with an elephant, others were waiting in enclosures less than a mile away with their legs shackled. The Prince is in Yunnan Province on the last leg of his tour of China. His visit to this far southwestern province was supposed to help highlight a cause close to him: the fight to conserve and save endangered species and highlight the trade in endangered wildlife. Sky News spent an hour at the show in which we watched tourists sitting on elephants trunks and riding on them. The animals, some wearing giant spectacles, sat down and balanced on tiny stools. Others kicked around footballs. The show lasts an hour, happens twice a day and is watched by hundreds of Chinese tourists. Sky News asked the Prince if he was aware the elephant entertainment was taking place down the road. He turned around but did not respond. Some 250 elephants live in Wild Elephant Valley near a town called Xishuangbanna. They represent the only 'wild' Asian elephants in China. However from what Sky News witnessed, many of them cannot be classed as living in the wild. Prince William, who is the patron of the Tusk Trust, wanted to use his last day here to learn more about China's role in fighting the illegal trade in wildlife. Speaking to journalists at the sanctuary about the global illegal wildlife trade, the Duke said: ""It is appalling that elephants and many others may be extinct in the wild in our lifetimes, and we seem to be hurtling towards the tragic outcome. ""The extinction of animals such as elephants, rhinos and pangolins would be an immeasurable loss to the whole of humanity."" Conservation groups agree that China is the main protagonist in the trade, with tonnes of ivory smuggled into the country from Africa. While there is no suggestion that the elephant William met or those performing are affected by the illegal trade, they are not living in the wild and are trained to entertain. Conservationists Sky News spoke to expressed surprise that palace officials would allow William to be seen to endorse a centre at which elephants perform. Fleur Dawes from Animal Defenders International said: ""’Using animals for entertainment in any sphere is completely wrong and fosters disrespect for the animals.  ""What we want is to protect these animals in their wild and natural environment. Reducing them to caricatures simply undermines that message.  ""So we would urge Prince William and all of the royal family to really bear that in mind. You simply cannot recreate the kind of natural environment in a wild life park where animals are forced to perform."" A three-year study by the World Animal Protection in 2014 into the welfare of captive elephants in Asia concluded that entertainment venues where elephants are forced into unnatural performances often causes them pain and suffering."

The industry regulator said the company, a member of the so-called 'big six' energy suppliers, had agreed to temporarily stop proactive selling from today as punishment for a series of failures. Ofgem found the supplier had failed to remove a backlog of outstanding Energy Ombudsman decisions by a November deadline. It said: ""Customers were experiencing long call waiting times, receiving late bills and the firm was not implementing Ombudsman decisions. ""ScottishPower ... signed up to three Ofgem targets to improve customer service within three months or suspend proactive sales activities until the targets were met. ""It has failed to reach the target to remove the backlog for acting on Ombudsman decisions for individual complaints by the end of November."" Ofgem said ScottishPower’s IT systems only allowed ""a partial implementation"" of the Ombudsman’s proposed remedies and the firm had been providing thousands of affected customers with free energy and writing off past debt as a result. The statement continued: ""ScottishPower has assured us that these Ombudsman requirements will remain in force for any case where the company can only partially implement the Ombudsman’s decisions. ""More than 2,000 customers are currently receiving free energy."" Sarah Harrison, who heads enforcement at the regulator, said: ""A sales ban illustrates the difficulties ScottishPower is having in delivering the levels of service customers deserve. ""While Ofgem’s targets have driven significant improvements in ScottishPower’s performance, we remain very concerned about how customers are being treated. ""As well as our ongoing investigation, we require ScottishPower to undertake an independent audit of its progress on improving customer service. ""We will keep the need for any further action under review."" ScottishPower insisted it was committed to improving customer service and said it had voluntarily agreed to the improvement targets. The chief executive of its retail and generation business, Neil Clitheroe, said: ""The process of moving to our new (IT) system has been challenging and has resulted in service problems for some of our customers. ""We are determined to put this right. We continue to correct problems, pay appropriate compensation and ensure no customer is left financially disadvantaged."" It said the failure to clear complaints via the Ombudsman was down to the fact 30 cases had been closed incorrectly. The statement continued: ""We are all fully committed to delivering continued service improvements, return to the high service standards long associated with ScottishPower and ensure that our customers realise the very real benefits of our IT system investment."""

Polly Chowdhury, 35, and Kiki Muddar, 43, were convicted at the Old Bailey on Wednesday of the manslaughter of Chowdhury's daughter Ayesha Ali. Both women held their heads in their hands as the verdicts were read out. The cause of the girl's death was recorded as a head injury, but Ayesha had suffered more than 50 injuries, including a bite mark on her shoulder and carpet burns. When paramedics found her she had been dead for some time. Polly Chowdhury, left, was controlled by her lover Kiki Muddar During proceedings, the court was told how the women's affair revolved around fictional Facebook characters that Muddar used to control Chowdhury. The jury was also told how the little girl was terrorised at night by the women wearing nightmarish masks. Gallery: Ayesha Ali, 8, Killed After 'Campaign Of Abuse' Ayesha Ali, eight, died from a head injury on 29 August, 2013 Examples from 41,000 text messages between the pair were read out in court to show how Muddar would influence her lover by telling her that Ayesha was ""evil"". The court heard that on 29 August, 2013, Muddar dialled 999 to report Chowdhury had tried to kill herself in the bath and that Ayesha was dead. Chowdhury had left a series of notes, in which she appeared to admit the killing, saying: ""I have taken my life and Ayesha's life."" Muddar had befriended Chowdhury when they lived next door to each other, and she used the Facebook alter egos to seduce her and turn her against her daughter, telling her ""you have no right to ever love or like your evil daughter"". Both women had denied murder, manslaughter and causing or allowing the death of a child between 1 March and 29 August, 2013. Muddar, who was diagnosed with a borderline narcissistic personality disorder, refused to give evidence but claimed she was at her parents' house on the night Ayesha died. The Metropolitan Police said Muddar left the house in Chadwell Heath, East London, on 28 August and later returned having appeared to have bought a new shower hose. A statement from police said this implied the existing shower hose had been used to assault Ayesha. Chowdhury told the court Muddar was giving her daughter a cold bath as punishment for wetting herself when she received her fatal injury. She said she found Muddar with her foot on the girl's chest in the bathroom, but after pushing her off went back to looking for a job on her computer. The child's father, Afsar Ali, 35, attended the trial each day and has told how he will never forgive his ex-wife for falling under the spell of their next-door-neighbour. ""It's completely destroyed my life from now until I die,"" he said. ""She loved life and her family and all she wanted was to be part of a happy family. I was her superhero, her super daddy. ""The reason why I wanted to attend every day was I wanted to relive Ayesha's life, feel the pain. I don't think I can ever imagine what she had to go through."" Judge Christopher Moss QC remanded the women in custody. They will be sentenced on Friday. Speaking outside court, Detective Sergeant Andy Nimmo said: ""Ayesha Ali was an innocent and defenceless eight-year-old child caught up in a bizarre set of circumstances and manipulated by two adults who were intent on causing her harm. ""Through social media and text, Muddar created a sophisticated web of lies and deceit which took officers months to unpick. What unravelled was a picture of enormous hatred directed towards Ayesha by both Muddar and Chowdhury. ""Ayesha should have been able to turn to one person who she could trust - her mother - but Chowdhury had allowed herself to become influenced by Muddar and together they inflicted serious emotional and finally physical harm on Ayesha."""
2015-03-04,Two Australian men convicted of drug smuggling in Indonesia have been taken from a prison in Bali to an island where they face execution by firing squad.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150304182224/http://news.sky.com/story/1438073/bali-nine-drug-smugglers-taken-to-execution-jail,"Two Australian men convicted of drug smuggling in Indonesia have been taken from a prison in Bali to an island where they face execution by firing squad. Myuran Sukumaran, 33, and Andrew Chan, 31, were found guilty in 2005 of being the ringleaders of the so-called ""Bali Nine"" drug smuggling gang. They were sentenced to death the following year. The transfer took place amid tight security involving hundreds of police Australia has been pursuing a campaign to save the men - but the Indonesian president has refused to grant them clemency. The pair lost their latest appeal in February. Gallery: Australian Prisoners Convicted Over Drug Smuggling The Bali Nine are a group of Australians jailed for attempting to smuggle over £2m of heroin out of Indonesia. Their sentences vary: some face life - the ringleaders face the firing squad The case has heightened diplomatic tensions between the two countries with Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott saying he was ""revolted"" by the planned executions. But Indonesian President Joko Widodo has warned foreign governments seeking clemency against interfering in his country's sovereign affairs. The two Australians were reported to be in one of two armoured vehicles that left Kerobokan Prison before dawn on Wednesday, amid a major security operation involving hundreds of police. They were taken to Bali's airport for the flight to the island of Nusakambangan, where executions are carried out at its maximum security prison. The pair are among 11 prisoners due to be shot by firing squad, mostly for drug crimes. The Australian government has stressed that Sukumaran and Chan have been rehabilitated in prison, where they had mentored younger inmates. Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has said Canberra would consider recalling its ambassador if the executions went ahead, as Brazil and the Netherlands did after executions in January, the first since Mr Widodo came to power. Six prisoners, including five foreigners from the Netherlands, Brazil, Malawi, Nigeria and Vietnam, were shot by firing squad in January. Mr Abbott said: ""I think there are millions of Australians who feel sick to their stomachs about what's likely to happen to these two men who committed a terrible crime, a terrible crime. ""But the position of Australia is that we abhor drug crime but we abhor the death penalty as well, which we think is beneath a country like Indonesia."" Indonesia resumed executions in 2013 after a five-year moratorium."

A reptile expert went to the scene and recovered the snake, which measured over 16ft 5in. The python is believed to have been 12 to 15 years old and could have been living in the wild for a number of days before it died. Police are investigating how the python came to be in the canal A post-mortem examination found signs of respiratory disease that could have contributed to its death. Police are investigating how the python came to be in the canal and are appealing for anyone with information to come forward. Ribble Valley Wildlife Crime Officer PC Carl Chew said: ""Experts believe that a python of this size could have been capable of attacking a person so it is fortunate that no one came to any serious harm. ""There are specific offences under the Wildlife and Countryside Act and Animal Welfare Act in relation to releasing a python and we would urge anyone with any information as to where the python came from to contact us. Experts say the snake could have been capable of attacking a person ""It is a possibility that the python may have outgrown its home and owners can contact Pip Reptile Rescue if they require any help or advice about caring for or rehousing reptiles. ""Similarly, we would urge anyone thinking about getting rid of their pets, particularly those which may pose a risk to the public, to contact an animal charity for advice so that they can be rehomed safely and responsibly."" Anyone with information can contact Lancashire Police on 101, quoting log number LC-20150301-0942. Alternatively, they can contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or online at Crimestoppers-uk.org."

Also killed in the crash on 3 February 1959 in Iowa was the aircraft pilot, Roger Peterson. An investigation at the time of the crash determined that the cause was pilot error and listed snow as a secondary cause. Buddy Holly's hits included Peggy Sue and That'll Be The Day According to local news reports, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is now considering reopening the crash after a pilot identified as LJ Coon sent the board a letter. Mr Coon argues that other factors should be considered, such as weight and balance calculations and the rate of the small plane’s climb and descent, according to the Globe Gazette. Buddy Holly's grave in Lubbock, Texas, where he was born Mr Coon also asked the board to investigate whether problems with the rudder pedals caused Mr Peterson to lose control of the aircraft, a Beechcraft Bonanza. The NTSB wrote to Coon on 19 February and said: ""You have gotten our attention”, the Des Moines Register reports. It might take weeks for the board to decide whether an investigation should be reopened. The original investigation said the crash was likely a pilot error The crash has been the subject of countless theories, books and movies. The song American Pie called 3 February 1959 ""the day the music died"". The three musicians were on tour when the crash happened."

The ground-based weapon is called ATHENA, or Advanced Test High Energy Asset. In the first field test of its kind, the truck was put on a platform with its engine running to keep the scenario as accurate as possible. The makers say the fibre laser weapon system prototype took only a few seconds from launch to burn through the engine. Lockheed bosses expressed satisfaction with the result, saying it has also worked in demonstrations against small airborne and sea-based targets. ""Fibre-optic lasers are revolutionising directed energy systems,"" said chief technology officer   Keoki Jackson. ""We are investing in every component of the system - from the optics and beam control to the laser itself - to drive size, weight and power efficiencies. ""This test represents the next step to providing lightweight and rugged laser weapon systems for military aircraft, helicopters, ships and trucks."""
2015-03-07,"Home is where the heart is, but these days it might also be your pension plan, a crippling millstone around your neck, or the thing you have to share with your parents until your mid-40s.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150307053359/http://news.sky.com/story/1436932/political-parties-wake-up-to-housing-crisis,"Home is where the heart is, but these days it might also be your pension plan, a crippling millstone around your neck, or the thing you have to share with your parents until your mid-40s. Ten years ago 59% of 25 to 34-year-olds owned their own home, the figure today is 36%. The reason is that house prices have soared compared to income, partly due to a shortage of new affordable homes along with the growing population. Hence - this is a huge election issue that plays into other arguments about economic growth, the cost of living crisis and immigration. The Conservatives have announced that their answer is to build 200,000 cut-price homes by 2020. They will offer first time buyers who are under 40 years-old a 20% reduction off the market rate - a discount the buyer would only have to hand back if they sell the property in the first five years. David Cameron promises these won't be ""rabbit hutches"" or ""shoeboxes"" but ""decent, well-built homes"". But who picks up the 20% shortfall? It was a question the party Chairman Grant Shapps was evasive about on Sky News when he was interviewed by Dermot Murnaghan on Sunday. However, a Number 10 spokesman explained that they will make it easier for developers to build on certain sites. He said: ""The key is that by removing the Section 106 requirement re social housing it will increase the number of sites that are viable."" So if, for example, to build 100 homes the original requirement was that 60 homes must be sold at market-value and 40 would be social housing, in the next government it could be 60 market-value, 20 Starter homes and 20 social housing properties.  Effectively, the 20% reduction homes cut into the number of social homes. The Tory argument is that without the change none of the homes would be built. Ed Miliband dismisses the plan as ""uncosted, unfunded… pie in the sky"". Labour says it will be building 200,000 homes a year by 2020 and that the party will tackle ""long-standing problems in the housing market which have caused a decline in construction capacity."" The party wants to get the public sector building more properties and force private development companies that own land not to ""bank it"", but get on and develop it, by introducing ""use it or lose it"" powers. Labour will also introduce plans to give priority to first-time buyers - but not the 20% reduction. In tandem with this, the party is looking to help ""generation rent"" by legislating to ensure landlords offer three-year tenancy agreements with a ceiling on the amount of rent they are allowed to charge. It is a classic market intervention policy from Ed Miliband, as he has shown with his proposed cap on energy bills, and once again it sets the two parties apart in their strategy for dealing with a problem. The Conservative instinct is to help developers create a larger market place so more people can own their homes, the Labour party instinctively thinking about tenants and how to put a cap on their outgoings. Housing doesn't traditionally hold the same electoral weight as economic policy, the NHS or education - but in many constituencies, especially metropolitan ones, many MPs fighting on the ground say housing is the number one issue. All the parties are now waking up to this."
2015-03-07,Downing Street has insisted the Prime Minister is only willing to take part in one televised leaders' debate before the General Election after four major broadcasters repeated they were planning to stage three.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150307053359/http://news.sky.com/story/1440130/leaders-debates-pm-rejects-broadcasters-call,"Downing Street has insisted the Prime Minister is only willing to take part in one televised leaders' debate before the General Election after four major broadcasters repeated they were planning to stage three. Sky News, Channel 4, the BBC and ITV said they were sticking to their plan of hosting one head-to-head contest between David Cameron and Labour leader Ed Miliband and two pitting seven party leaders against each other during the election campaign. They made it clear they were ready to go ahead with the debates even if Mr Cameron decides not to take part - raising the possibility that the PM could be ""empty-chaired"". The seven party leaders who could take part in at least one TV debate Earlier this week, Mr Cameron issued an ultimatum to the organisations, saying he would only agree to take part in a single seven-way debate in the week beginning 23 March and before the campaign. Labour has accused Mr Cameron of trying to ""bully"" broadcasters into dropping plans for a two-way contest - which Sky News and Channel 4 plan to host on 30 April, ahead of polling on 7 May. The four organisations have said this TV debate needs to take place - as well as the two seven-way debates of a minimum of two hours each, involving the leaders of the Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats, Greens, UKIP, SNP and Plaid Cymru. But in a response to the broadcasters, Mr Cameron's spokesman Craig Oliver said: ""I made the Prime Minister's final position clear in my last letter - he is willing to do a seven-way debate in the week beginning 23 March. ""Clearly it is disappointing that you are not prepared to take him up on that offer. I am ready to discuss at your convenience the logistics of making the debate we have suggested happen."" Mr Miliband said: ""It is make your mind up time for David Cameron. He can keep running from these debates with me and show himself to be a weak leader running from his record. ""Or he can agree to the debates which the British people deserve and that our democracy needs."" The Prime Minister said he would agree to one 90-minute debate of at least seven leaders, and possibly also the DUP in Northern Ireland. He said: ""What I have done is unblock the log jam that I am afraid the broadcasters help to create and said 'let's have the debate that gives everybody a say and let's get on with it before the campaign'."" The Downing Street ultimatum earlier this week was made in a letter sent to Sue Inglish, the chair of the broadcasters' leaders' debates committee, by Mr Cameron's communications director Mr Oliver. But the broadcasters want their three debates to take place on 2 April (ITV), 16 April (BBC) and 30 April (Sky News and Channel 4) and are urging the Prime Minister to appear in all of them. They wrote a letter to Mr Oliver, saying: ""We have consistently set out our intention to hold three debates during the unusually long formal election campaign period  - 30 March to 7 May 2015. ""We spaced the planned debates two weeks apart, twice the length of time between debates as compared to 2010. The dates - 2 April, 16 April and 30 April - were first published in October 2014 and have not been changed. ""We believe that the formal election period is the right time to hold election debates. ""It is the point at which the parties have published their election manifestos and the point at which the electorate as a whole is most engaged with discussion of election issues and the public debate about the future of the country."" Sky News' Director of Newsgathering Jonathan Levy said: ""We really hope the Prime Minister will reconsider our invitation to take part in a head-to-head debate. ""The debates will go ahead with the leaders that turn up, and the invitation will remain open to the Prime Minister should he wish to reconsider his position."" Deputy Prime Minister and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg called on him to take part in three contests, tweeting: ""Come on @David_Cameron you haven't got your own way so accept it and take part. #tvdebates."" UKIP leader Nigel Farage said: I am pleased the broadcasters have stood firm at last. Would have been better to stick to the original proposal which included fewer parties.  Nonetheless accept the challenge."" SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I will debate David Cameron anytime, anywhere, and on any number of occasions - but a Tory Prime Minister simply cannot be allowed to dictate terms to everyone else."" Peter Robinson of the DUP told Sky News: ""I wonder who the broadcasters think they are, that they just set down a diktat and we all follow."" However, he added: ""No politician, in my view, if they are given that offer of having that airtime to speak directly to the electorate, will want to miss that opportunity. Certainly I don't."" Sky News and Channel 4 have already said they are prepared to hold the two-way debate on a different date if the leaders of the Labour and Conservative parties can agree. All four broadcasters said in a statement: ""Some 22 million people watched the leaders' debates in 2010 and there is a public desire and expectation for them to happen again in 2015."""

The Spaniard had apparently forgotten his Formula One debut with Minardi in 2001, becoming the youngest ever F1 Champion in 2005 and his second championship the following year. He also told doctors he remembered nothing about the crash at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, which saw him lose control and hit a wall.  Alonso will not compete in Melbourbe despite a clean bill of health Alonso will sit out the opening Grand Prix of the season in Australia despite being given a clean bill of health. Doctors asked the McLaren driver to avoid racing in Melbourne because of the fear of ""second-impact syndrome"", a second concussion occurring when the effects of the first are still subsiding, potentially resulting in severe brain injuries or even death.

Ayesha Ali was found dead at her home in rast London with more than 50 injuries to her head, body and limbs. These included bite marks and carpet burns. Her mother, 35-year-old Polly Chowdhury, was sentenced to 13 years for manslaughter.  Polly Chowdhury (L) was controlled by her lover Kiki Muddar Chowdhury's lesbian lover, Kiki Muddar, got 18 years for the same offence after dealing the fatal blow in August 2013. The trial heard that the women had a bizarre relationship, with Muddar using fictional Facebook characters to control Chowdhury.

A few days before the killing, a neighbour heard the little girl screaming, sobbing and pleading with her mother: ""Amah, I don't want to be bad; Amah, Amah, I don't want to be bad."" Judge Christopher Moss QC said Ayesha's final months were ""a life of cruelty and misery that defies belief"". The judge described Muddar, 43, as a ""manipulative and wicked woman"" who ""entered the world of this family and tore it apart"". She sent 40,000 text messages in the process of brainwashing Chowdhury into thinking her daughter was ""evil"" and had ""bad blood"". In a recorded phone conversation with a friend a month before the killing, Muddar described Ayesha as a ""witch"" and threatened to drown her in the bath. Both Muddar, of Green Lane, Ilford, and Chowdhury, of Broomfield Road, Chadwell Heath, had denied murder, manslaughter and causing or allowing the death of a child. Judge Moss paid tribute to the ""courage and personal restraint"" of Ayesha's father, Afsar Ali, who attended every day of the trial to hear what his daughter went through. The trial heard Chowdhury tried to keep him away through court orders at the time she was abusing Ayesha. ""It's completely destroyed my life from now until I die,"" Mr Ali said. ""She loved life and her family and all she wanted was to be part of a happy family. I was her superhero, her super daddy. ""The reason why I wanted to attend every day was I wanted to relive Ayesha's life, feel the pain. I don't think I can ever imagine what she had to go through."""

The suspected hacker, 23, was arrested by officers from the National Crime Agency (NCA) in Sutton Coldfield, in the West Midlands, on suspicion of offences linked to data stolen from a messaging service used by DoD employees worldwide. Contact details for around 800 people, including name, title, email addresses and phone numbers, were obtained in the attack last June, the NCA said. The details for around 34,400 devices were also taken, the agency said. The hacker posted screenshots taken from the dashboard used to control the database, as well as a strange message on the text storage website Pastebin. It said: ""We smite the Lizards, LizardSquad your time is near. We're in your bases, we control your satellites. ""The missiles shall rein upon thy who claim alliance, watch your heads, ** T-47:59:59 until lift off. ""We're one, we're many, we lurk in the dark, we're everywhere and anywhere. ""Live Free Die Hard! DoD, DISA EMSS : Enhanced Mobile Satellite Services is not all, Department of Defense has no Defenses."" The data was used as part of an international satellite message dissemination system called Enhanced Mobile Satellite Services. IMEI numbers, the unique codes used to identify a mobile device, were also stolen. The NCA said no sensitive data was obtained and none of the data that was taken could be used to personally identify anyone or threaten US national security. The agency has made more than 40 arrests this week at more than 20 different locations across England, Wales and Scotland as part of a week of activity targeting cyber crime. Andy Archibald, deputy director of the NCA's National Cyber Crime Unit, said: ""Behind this week's activity is the message that all of us, as individuals, businesses or law enforcement agencies, have a role to play in making the UK a safe place to enjoy the huge opportunities provided by the internet. ""Awareness of the type of cyber crime dangers which are out there is vital, whoever you are, as is collaboration between organisations across different sectors, regions and countries to develop the most effective ways of combating those threats. ""We will continue to work with partners to pursue and disrupt the major crime groups targeting the UK, but also, crucially, to make the UK as difficult as possible a target for cyber criminals in the first place."" Jeffrey Thorpe, special agent in charge at the US Department of Defence criminal investigative service (DCIS), said: ""This arrest underscores DCIS commitment and the joint ongoing efforts among international law enforcement to stop cyber criminals in their tracks. ""DCIS special agents will use every tool at their disposal to pursue and bring to justice those that attack the Department of Defence."""

Liam Scholes was told he was not welcome at the event at Sale High School in Greater Manchester after turning up as the character Christian Grey. The school was taking part in a national event day where children were encouraged to dress up as famous literary characters from books. Liam arrived wearing a grey suit and carrying an eye mask and cable ties. But teachers telephoned his mother Nicola and said the outfit was inappropriate and he would not be taking part in the event or group photographs. ""He went in a suit and shoes and with an eye mask and cable ties,"" Ms Scholes told the Manchester Evening News. ""The cable ties were tiny and not enough to do anything with them. ""If it was a primary school I could understand but it’s a secondary school and the book and the film have been everywhere - it’s one of the most famous books in recent years and it’s not like the pupils will be unaware of it."" Ms Scholes claimed one of the teachers arrived dressed as the homicidal serial killer Dexter Morgan from the Jeff Lindsay novel Darkly Dreaming Dexter. ""I don’t see why sex is seen as more offensive than murder,"" she said. ""He went as a book character and it didn't say in the rules that the children had to have read the book. ""He's aware the book contains things of a sexual nature … but it was nothing sinister and no offence was intended; it was meant to be a laugh. ""The school wanted him to change his character to James Bond; ironically a very promiscuous character who kills people - so I don't know which is worse."" But a spokesperson from the campaign 50 Shades Is Abuse supported the school's decision. ""WHY would anyone dress their child up as a guy who stalks, coerces, threatens and manipulates a woman??!!"" the group tweeted. The school's headmistress said she stood by the decision it made which she claimed reflected the school's high standards of student behaviour, welfare and safeguarding. Lynn Nicholls said: ""The aim of our World Book Day events was to celebrate and encourage reading and we are disappointed that what was a fantastic day for our students has been marred by this issue."" The school said Liam was allowed to take part in the event after his costume had been ""modified"" but it declined to explain how his costume had been changed."

Named as 'Sean' and from London, he was pictured in a photo on the 4chan site looking down in the dumps after apparently being made fun of. An anonymous poster wrote: ""Spotted this specimen trying to dance the other week. He stopped when he saw us laughing."" The post was republished on photo site imgur and quickly picked up more than 2000 comments of support for the mystery man's moves. 'Sean' held up this message of thanks. Pic: Twitter/@Dancingmanfound One person posted: ""I literally want to hug him. His face… he looks so defeated. I want to tell him to keep dancing and don't care about those people."" Cassandra Fairbanks, who spearheaded the #finddancingman campaign, told Sky News the original taunts were ""disgusting bullying"", but that Sean was now basking in internet love. ""There have been so many [messages] – it’s just been an outpouring of support and love and kindness. ""He’s been wonderful. He said he’s been smiling and laughing all day and reading everybody’s tweets."" Pharrell could be about to join the fun. Pic: Twitter/@Pharrell She explained ""a whole bunch of women from LA from various fields"" had got behind the campaign after being outraged by the nasty comments. And now a photo of a chuffed-looking Sean has emerged and he appears to have set up his own Twitter account, @dancingmanfound. Cassandra told Sky News she is in contact with him and trying to arrange dates. A fundraising page has been set up to fund Sean’s LA adventure. ""We have over 17,000 people in our group so I think we can swing the airfare,"" said Cassandra, who is promising the lucky Londoner an ""epic"" trip. ""We organised a huge sleepover party a few months ago,"" she said. ""We had bouncy houses, and a monkey I think was there; giant pizzas, air mattresses… ""I think we can organise an even more epic dance party. There are already a lot of artists volunteering to perform, people are offering all kinds of stuff."" Happy singer Pharrell Williams could be one of those performing in Sean's honour, tweeting on Friday ""keep me posted about your dance party"" ... never be ashamed of yourself."""
2015-03-07,Four more people have been charged in connection with the murder of teenager Becky Watts.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150307053359/http://news.sky.com/story/1439897/becky-watts-four-more-people-in-court,"By Adele Robinson, Sky News Correspondent Four more people have been charged in connection with the murder of teenager Becky Watts. Karl Demetrius and Donovan Demetrius, both 29, along with Jaydene Parsons, 23, all of Barton Court, Bristol, have been charged with assisting an offender. Nathan Matthews is charged with Becky's murder James Ireland, 23, of Richmond Villas, Avonmouth, faces the same charge. All four are have been remanded in custody to appear at Bristol Crown Court on the 26th of March. A fifth person, who was arrested on Monday, has been released without charge. It comes after Becky's stepbrother Nathan Matthews appeared in crown court for the first time charged with her murder. Matthews appeared via video link unshaven in a grey sweatshirt and in a hearing that lasted 15 minutes he spoke only to confirm his name. Prosecutor James Ward told the court: ""The allegations of this case have been well-rehearsed in the press recently and I do not propose to go into the finer details. ""There are still people helping the police with their inquiries. Therefore, it would be wrong to place before the media further details about this case. Mr Ward said police were assessing ""at least"" 1,200 exhibits in connection with the case. ""Much forensic work needs to be done,"" he said. Matthews was remanded into custody and will next appear before a judge on 26 March. On Thursday he appeared before Bristol magistrates with his 21-year-old girlfriend Shauna Hoare. Hoare is charged with intending to pervert the course of justice and will also appear in Bristol Crown Court on 26 March. Becky, 16, disappeared from her home in the St George area of Bristol on 19 February. Police launched a huge search for the teenager and a social media campaign that reached millions of people. Body parts were later found at a house in the Barton Hill area of the city. Bouquets, teddies and cards have been left at Becky's home, as well as at Barton Court, and mourners have attended churches across the city to pay their respects."

Kyle Dube, of Orono, Maine, planned to abduct 15-year-old Nichole Cable and then rescue her to look like a hero, prosecutors said. The jury took less an hour to convict him of kidnapping and murdering the high school student in May 2013. Dube made up a Facebook profile using the identity of his girlfriend's ex-boyfriend to make contact with Nichole and arrange a meeting. Dube faces life in prison Prosecutors said he planned to stage her abduction wearing a ski mask, then return later without disguise and take the credit for saving her. But Dube's former girlfriend testified that he had confessed to strangling the girl, for reasons which remain unclear. Nichole was found dead of asphyxiation in the woods after an eight-day search. Prosecutors said DNA evidence tied Dube to her disappearance. The fake Facebook profile was also traced back to his home. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Marchese said: ""Is there a cautionary tale here? Yes. ""It's a cautionary tale to everyone to be careful when you are using social media."" Dube faces 25 years to life in prison for the murder conviction and up to 30 years for the kidnapping conviction."
2015-03-07,A few months ago I asked someone close to the David Cameron whether he – and others in the Prime Minister's inner circle – felt it was right to take part in the televised election campaigns.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150307053359/http://news.sky.com/story/1439323/so-what-is-holding-pm-back-from-head-to-head,"A few months ago I asked someone close to the David Cameron whether he – and others in the Prime Minister's inner circle – felt it was right to take part in the televised election campaigns. ""No,"" was the emphatic and unequivocal response. The source said that agreeing to participate would be a ""lose, lose"" scenario for the Conservative leader. That could be seen as a strange response when you consider that Tory strategists desperately want this election campaign to be framed as a battle of the prime ministers. They believe that if the question facing voters on 7 May is David Cameron versus Ed Miliband (as opposed to simply Conservative v Labour) then the Conservative party has a much better chance of winning. Tory MPs agree. One backbencher told me that Mr Cameron was unquestionably an asset on the doorstep for him and his colleagues, while some within Labour have criticised Mr Miliband as an Achilles heel in the ground war. A shadow cabinet member admitted that their party leader’s poor personal ratings could be a drag during the election campaign. Perhaps that is why Mr Cameron has said more than once that he would be happy to take Mr Miliband on in a two-way debate. And yet this ""final offer"" of a single seven-way debate before the campaign kicks off suggests that Tory advisers disagree. So what is the worry? Well Mr Cameron has argued for a number of years that the debates sucked the life out of the election campaign in 2010. But one senior Tory told me that it is much more than that. He argued that Mr Cameron had everything to lose, and Mr Miliband everything to gain, pointing out that the Labour leader's personal ratings were already very low. The Tories don't need the debates to help with that, he added. Instead they fear that even a half-decent performance by Mr Miliband would be better than voters expect and so result in a poll boost for Labour. They also worry that the Prime Minister can look shaky at his weekly question time in the House of Commons when the Labour leader pushes him on detail. Twitter is alight with accusations that Mr Cameron is chickening out. His advisers certainly don't see it like that - but they are taking a very risk averse stance. After all Mr Cameron may have something to lose, but he also has something to gain. His party is not – according to current polls – on track to win a majority in May. If – as they believe – people would rather see David Cameron than Ed Miliband in Downing Street, then some would argue that a head-to-head debate is a way to underline that choice in voters' minds."
2015-03-07,The families of three London schoolgirls feared to have fled to Syria to become jihadi brides have accused the Metropolitan Police of failing to pass on a crucial letter.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150307053359/http://news.sky.com/story/1440349/missing-girls-families-slam-police-over-letter,"The families of three London schoolgirls feared to have fled to Syria to become jihadi brides have accused the Metropolitan Police of failing to pass on a crucial letter. They say a letter from the force requesting to interview the girls in relation to a classmate who ran away to Syria last year should have been handed directly to the families. However, the letters were hidden by the girls in their school textbooks and their families never saw them. Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and 15-year-old Amira Abase, who attended Bethnal Green Academy in east London, sparked a police hunt after they flew to Istanbul from Gatwick Airport last month. They are now believed to be in Syria. Abase Hussein, the father of Amira, insisted that if he had seen the police letter he would have talked his daughter out of leaving and taken away her passport. Halima Khanom, sister of Kadiza Sultana, said: ""We wouldn't have been here today doing this if we'd got that letter and known what was going on."" Scotland Yard confirmed that it sent letters out to the three girls after their friend disappeared in December and that they were also spoken to by officers as part of a ""routine inquiry"". A Metropolitan Police statement said: ""The Metropolitan Police Service has been engaged with staff at the girls' school since December 2014 as part of the routine inquiry by officers investigating the disappearance of their friend. ""There was nothing to suggest at the time that the girls themselves were at risk and indeed their disappearance has come as a great surprise, not least to their own families. ""The girls were spoken to in December 2014 as part of the routine inquiry by officers investigating the disappearance of their friend. ""We continue to liaise with the school and local education authority in connection with this ongoing investigation."""

Passers-by found the body in a ravine in the area in which former boxer Michael Graydon was last seen. Mr Graydon, who runs a boxing organisation near Bristol, disappeared last month while on a trip to Monaco. The 29-year-old father of one was last seen in the early hours of 21 February. He was seen leaving the principality's ""pink palace"", the official residence of Prince Albert. Later, CCTV footage appeared to show him running away. His family have set up social media campaigns as part of the search. Officials in Monaco said the identity of the body and the cause of death had not been confirmed."

Leslie Ross, 67, who denies the charges, was remanded in custody after appearing at Newry Magistrates' Court. Mother-of-four Michelle Bickerstaff, 47, was found dead in 2012, five years after the body of 50-year-old Margaret Weise was discovered. Both women had been in a relationship with Ross, from Dromore in County Down, at the time of their deaths. The court heard there was insufficient evidence to proceed with a case concerning the alleged murder of a third former partner, Elizabeth McKee, who died in 2002. As the judge made his determination, relatives of the three women who were packed into the public gallery of the court began to weep. The judgement followed a three-day preliminary inquiry at Armagh Magistrates' Court last month during which some family members had given evidence. Addressing them directly, Judge Peter King said he had been ""impressed and moved"" by the content of their evidence. Minutes into the hearing Ross, who is partially deaf, had to be moved from the dock into the press benches because he could not hear the judge. ""I can hear you but, I can't make out what you are saying,"" he told the judge. Ross, who has spent the past 18 months in Maghaberry high security prison in Co Antrim, appeared relaxed throughout the hearing as he sat in the dock flanked by two prison guards. Outside the court his solicitor Conleth Downey said: ""My client has steadfastly denied the counts of murdering three women."" His next court appearance will be at Laganside Crown Court in Belfast on April 24."

Padge-Victoria Windslowe was accused of killing 20-year-old Claudia Aderotimi during an illegal surgical procedure that involved industrial-grade silicone and Krazy Glue. Windslowe was also convicted on Monday of aggravated assault for injuries to another woman who was taken to hospital after silicone from an injection spread to her lungs. The 45-year-old told jurors she performed thousands of the procedures despite a lack of formal medical training. Victim Claudia Aderotimi was celebrating her 20th birthday She described herself as a former madam and hip-hop performer known as ""the Black Madam"". Prosecutors said Windslowe fled after a botched injection killed Ms Aderotimi in 2011. Windslowe, who is transgender, testified that she did not check her phone or email in the months afterward because she was in France and ignoring people who were ""transphobic"". Ms Aderotimi complained of chest pains and breathing problems during the procedure at a hotel in February 2011. She died the next day in hospital. Her family in England chose not to attend the trial in Philadelphia. The long-time friend who accompanied Ms Aderotimi to the US to celebrate her 20th birthday also declined to make the trip. The friend's 2012 testimony, read aloud in court, described the meeting as ""a touch-up"" after their prior visit to the woman they knew as ""Lillian"". Windslowe boasted about her so-called surgical skills in court, telling the judge: ""Everyone was calling me 'the Michelangelo of buttocks injections'."" She charged about $1,000 to $2,000 per session, according to two of her clients who testified. Windslowe faces up to 40 years in prison on the murder conviction alone."

The latest data from Kantar Worldpanel, for the 12 weeks to 1 March, showed annual price falls reached a new low of -1.6% in the period. Its report cited a combination of lower general inflation and price battles, and calculated that shoppers had saved a combined £400m over the 12 weeks. Inflation has fallen largely as a result of weaker oil costs, although the battle for market share among top supermarkets has also contributed. The Kantar statistics provided further cheer for Britain's biggest supermarket chain as it moves to improve its offering to shoppers and image in the wake of its accounting scandal. They showed Tesco recorded its strongest sales performance in 18 months, rising 1.1% during the 12-week period as chief executive Dave Lewis's turnaround plan continued to make an impact. Dairy products are among the items being slashed in price Its 'big four' rivals, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons, recorded sales falls of 2.1%, 0.5% and 0.4% respectively as they continue to battle for business amid the challenge from discounters Aldi and Lidl, and Waitrose at the top end. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel, said: ""All of the major supermarkets are cutting prices to win shoppers, especially within everyday staples such as eggs, vegetables and milk. ""Retailers are focusing their efforts on simple price cuts rather than complicated ‘multibuy’ deals. ""Among the big four supermarkets Tesco has been the standout retailer ... increasing sales have helped Tesco arrest its falling market share, which is down just 0.1 percentage point compared with last year. ""This resurgence has impacted Asda which competes for many of the same shoppers as Tesco. ""Asda’s sales are down by 2.1%, taking its market share to 17.0%. ""Morrisons and Sainsbury’s both grew behind the market average, with sales falling by 0.4% and 0.5% respectively."" Both Morrisons and Waitrose are due to release their annual results on Thursday and are expected to confirm falling profits."

The grave at the site of the new Liverpool Street station, which will serve the London Crossrail line, was used as a burial ground from 1569 until 1738 and it is hoped tests on excavated victims will enable a better understanding of the disease. Some 10,000 artefacts have already been recovered during Crossrail works Lead archaeologist Jay Carver said: ""This excavation presents a unique opportunity to understand the lives and deaths of 16th and 17th century Londoners. ""The Bedlam burial ground spans a fascinating phase of London's history, including the transition from the Tudor-period city into cosmopolitan early-modern London. ""This is probably the first time a sample of this size from this time period has been available for archaeologists to study in London. ""Bedlam was used by a hugely diverse population from right across the social spectrum and from different areas of the city."" A team of 60 archaeologists will work in shifts six days a week to remove the skeletons in what could be London's most valuable 16th and 17th-century cemetery site. They have already found more than 10,000 artefacts spanning many years of London's past across more than 40 construction sites. It is the UK's largest archaeology project. Preliminary excavations at the Liverpool Street site in 2013 and 2014 uncovered more than 400 skeletons and numerous artefacts. The Great Plague killed an estimated 100,000 people in 1665-66, nearly a quarter of London's population, and tests on excavated plague victims will further understanding of the evolution of the plague bacteria strain."
2015-03-10,The organisers of Crufts have said there is no proof any dogs were poisoned at this year's show.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150310154446/http://news.sky.com/story/1441834/crufts-death-no-proof-dogs-were-poisoned,"The organisers of Crufts have said there is no proof any dogs were poisoned at this year's show. The Kennel Club made the declaration after earlier confirming it was looking into reports that up to six animals had been targeted. Its investigation follows the death of an Irish setter named Jagger after it allegedly ate beef laced with poison. According to the Daily Telegraph, several other dogs including a West Highland white terrier, an Afghan hound and a shih-tzu were also sick after the show at the Birmingham NEC. The spate of sickness has sparked concerns that one or more people may have been poisoning the dogs. Kennel Club Secretary Caroline Kisko said she wished to ""make it absolutely clear that there is currently no evidence that any dog has been poisoned at Crufts"". She added:""Whilst there are suspicions about poisoning, the veterinary surgeon who carried out the post mortem (on Jagger) has told the Kennel Club that she cannot comment on where, when and indeed if poisoning has taken place until the results of the toxicology report are available. ""Whilst reports surrounding the welfare of dogs at Crufts are taken with the utmost of seriousness, a number of the reports in the news about dogs becoming sick after leaving the show have been from anonymous sources, who have not reported the allegations to us or the police, and we cannot look into claims about which we have no direct information. ""We urge these people and anybody else who may have similar concerns to come forward and report them to the Kennel Club."" Ms Kisko warned anyone ""caught attempting to deliberately sabotage another competitor's performance, particularly if a dog's welfare is put at risk"" will face severe disciplinary action and could be prosecuted under the Animal Welfare Act. Reports of other dogs being poisoned came as the co-owners of Jagger, Jeremy and Dee Milligan-Bott, vowed to return to Crufts next year. ""Crufts is the best show in the world and we will certainly be back again next year competing. This one isolated incident will not spoil our enjoyment to show and compete with our lovely dogs,"" Mr Bott said. Three-year-old Jagger, whose pedigree name is Thendara Satisfaction, came second in his class at the show on Thursday. He collapsed and died after returning to his co-owner in Belgium, Aleksandra Lauwers. The owners have said that beef laced with unknown poisons was found during a post-mortem examination. The results of toxicology tests are expected next week. Mrs Milligan-Bott said Jagger's death was the result of a ""heinous crime"", but she believed it was a random attack and did not think another exhibitor was responsible. The four-day event finished on Sunday, with Scottish Terrier Knopa named Best In Show."
2015-03-10,I was taken aback by the strength of the attack by Labour's shadow education secretary on Policy Exchange with regards to its research supporting the expansion of free schools.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150310154446/http://news.sky.com/story/1441572/were-labour-criticisms-of-think-tank-fair,"I was taken aback by the strength of the attack by Labour's shadow education secretary on Policy Exchange with regards to its research supporting the expansion of free schools. Tristram Hunt described the report as ""shoddy"", claiming the think-tank had been set up by Tory ministers to push Tory policies and was ""not credible"". It was a verbal assault  - but was any of it fair? Tory MP Michael Gove set up Policy Exchange Well, it is true that this is a group that bangs the drum for free schools - it would openly admit to that. In fact, arguably it was this think-tank that came up with the idea in the first place. Secondly, it does have links to senior Conservatives. One of them - Michael Gove - set up the group before going on to become a Tory MP and then education secretary. But none of that means Policy Exchange doesn't have the right to look at data in this area. In fact, it has a strong motivation to do exactly that. So what about the more specific criticisms? The report's main finding is that where free schools have opened, the closest state schools also appear to have improved. One charge is that the sample size is too small. In my opinion that is unfair. After all, Policy Exchange has taken every one of the 171 free schools that exist, and looked at the three schools nearest to them. What more could they do? If there is an issue with the numbers, it is that there aren't many free schools yet to look at. So it may be too early to draw sweeping conclusions - but on the basis of what exists, the scale of this research is sound. But there is a second criticism, which I do think is fair. The clear implication from Policy Exchange (at least in media interviews) is that it is the free schools that are driving the improvement in their neighbourhoods by injecting competition into the local education system. They are - of course - allowed to surmise that, but there is nothing in the research that conclusively proves it. In fact, on page 18, the study clearly states ""correlation should not be mistaken for causation"". That means that the improvements they have identified could be being driven by something completely different. In fact, critics have pointed out that many of the new free schools are in London where other schools have benefited from a surge in financial investment, new head teachers and gentrification. They would say those are the factors really driving the improvements in performance. And yet Policy Exchange can fairly suggest that there is no evidence of a dramatic downward impact on other local schools when a free school opens. So where does all this leave us? Well, we know that free schools are a relatively new phenomenon; we know that Policy Exchange is a cheerleader for them; and we know that the group can legitimately point to some encouraging early data. But it isn't more than that. The reason that free schools remain such a fierce, ideological divide in politics is in part because there simply isn't powerful evidence in one direction or the other. Policy Exchange has added a piece to the jigsaw. But the jury is still out."

The airline made £14.4m in 2014 following a pre-tax loss of £54m the previous year. It credited strategic changes along with operational and cost efficiencies for achieving a target set in February 2013 to return to profitability within two years. Sir Richard, who founded the airline and remains its president, said: ""I can't think of a better way to complete our 30th birthday year than with a return to profit. ""The team at Virgin Atlantic has done a great job in turning around the airline and has the right strategy to take the business from strength to strength. ""Keeping our customers and our people at the heart of everything we do gives me great confidence in our future and I look forward to the next 30 years."" Chief executive Craig Kreeger said the results marked the conclusion of the recovery period, putting ""firm foundations in place for the future"". Virgin group revenue was £2.9bn in 2014, with Virgin Holidays recording a profit for the year before tax and exceptional items of £5.7m, up £3m year on year. It also marked a rise in passenger satisfaction scores despite more than 14% of its aircraft running behind schedule. The carrier has begun a fleet regeneration programme towards more fuel-efficient aircraft and said its joint venture partnership with Delta, which began in January last year, helped it achieve 4.5 million ticket sales for joint venture services in 2014. Among new routes to be launched this summer will be services between Manchester and Atlanta and London Heathrow and Detroit."

Margaret Hodge, chair of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, gave Rona Fairhead a dressing down during a hearing over failings at HSBC bank where she had oversight of the bank's audit committee. It followed revelations the bank had allowed tax avoidance and evasion to go on while she was in that role at the bank, and which she only moved from in 2010. Ms Hodge said: ""I'm going to say something as a licence fee payer. ""I think you knew (there was) tax evasion, or you didn't know and I think in that case you are either incredibly naive or totally incompetent and I don't think that the record that you've shown, or your performance here as a guardian of HSBC, gives me the confidence that you should be the guardian of the BBC licence fee payers. ""I really do think you should consider your position and you should think about resigning and if not, I think the Government should sack you."" Ms Fairhead said she totally refuted the accusation. She said: ""In the period when I was chair of the committees I was in a non-executive position of oversight ... at that time I think it is reasonable for a non executive director to rely on the policies, the management structures in place, to rely on independent experts that had been commissioned because of their expertise to highlight issues. ""That was absolutely what we insisted on. You can ask anybody in the bank, we were unyielding if we discovered or thought or suspected of any wrongdoing. So I absolutely refute what you said."" Ms Fairhead had been grilled by the committee for nearly two hours over her role at the bank during the period when the alleged tax evasion went on. She was repeatedly asked how it was her committee had not picked up the tax evasion, when its role was to make sure the bank was adhering to the rules and regulations of the banking industry. She revealed that she is paid £334,000 a year by HSBC for between 75 and 100 days of work a year, carries out around 150 to 180 days of work a year for the BBC Trust and around 25 days work a year for Pepsi. Also facing questions were current HSBC CEO Stuart Gulliver and former CEO Chris Meares who were both attacked over their roles. Last month, a number of stolen files were made public in a French newspaper which claimed that HSBC's Swiss private banking arm helped clients in more than 200 countries evade taxes on accounts containing £77bn ($119bn). The alleged evasion was said to have taken place at HSBC's private bank in Switzerland in the mid-2000s. HSBC chairman Douglas Flint previously told Parliament's Treasury Select Committee that the executives at the time bear ""fairly direct responsibility for what went on in the private bank during their stewardship"". Mr Meares told the Public Accounts Committee: ""I was not personally accountable for the actions of individuals in Switzerland but I absolutely share responsibility for the events, if any of these reported practices went on, for what happened on my watch."" When Ms Hodge asked Rona Fairhead if she knew what was going on, the BBC Trust chairwoman said: ""No I did not. ""Was any evidence brought to the committee of the practices that we are talking about now, the answer is absolutely no."" The BBC Trust has defended Ms Fairhead, saying in a statement: ""Rona Fairhead is committed to her role as Chairman of the BBC Trust, representing the interests of licence fee payers. As she has said before, the BBC is her main priority."""
2015-03-10,"A Muslim former police chief has condemned the Government's strategy for tackling radicalisation as ""toxic"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150310154446/http://news.sky.com/story/1441805/anti-radicalisation-strategy-toxic-to-muslims,"A Muslim former police chief has condemned the Government's strategy for tackling radicalisation as ""toxic"". Former Chief Superintendent Dal Babu has said most Muslims are suspicious of the community-led Prevent scheme, and believe it is being used to spy on them. Mr Babu, who retired from the Metropolitan Police in 2013, said the force's counter-terrorism command was ""virtually all white"" and there was a ""lack of knowledge"" around race and faith issues. He said: ""There's been a lot of concern about the Prevent strategy in the Muslim community over the last few years. ""Prevent was bought in with good intentions but over the years it has alienated the Muslim community who see it as spying. Sir Peter Fahy has defended the Prevent strategy ""It's a toxic brand in the same way the Big Society idea was brought in but we don't hear about it much any more. ""There's a lack of diversity in the police and, equally important, a lack of diversity in children's services."" The Prevent scheme, which has an annual budget of £40m, is one of four parts of Contest - the acronym given to the Government's counter-terrorism strategy. Aimed at stopping people becoming terrorists, it has been under the spotlight after hundreds of Britons are believed to have travelled to Syria to join Islamic State, including three London schoolgirls who left the UK last month. In 2014, counter-terror officers received 77 reports from families as part of the Prevent scheme - some of which enabled police to catch potential terrorists. Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy, national policing lead for Prevent, defended the scheme and said parents must take responsibility for stopping their children being radicalised. He said: ""Extremist voices have been allowed to fill spaces in the media too regularly and this misrepresents the vast majority of Muslims who are committed to British values. ""The prime responsibility for stopping young people thinking of travelling to Syria or other warzones must be with their families and carers, who know them and are able to spot the early signs of radicalisation."" A spokesman from the Home Office said: ""As a country, we must consistently challenge the twisted narrative of extremism. ""This Government fundamentally revised the Prevent strategy in 2011 to ensure it challenges terrorist ideology, supports people who are vulnerable to being drawn into terrorism and works with sectors and institutions where there are risks of radicalisation."" He added that the Home Office was drawing up a new strategy which deals with ""the whole spectrum of extremism""."

It will go on sale in the US, Britain and China on 24 April, with preorders taken from 10 April. The main Apple Watch will start at £479 and go up to £519. The Sport incarnation of the device will start at £299 for the 38mm face, and the 42mm version is £339. The high end model, a limited edition 18 carat gold watch, will set you back at least £8,000 with prices rising to £13,500 - a revelation that drew gasps from the crowd that gathered for the announcement. Mr Cook said the watch will last for 18 hours on a typical day Reaction to the device has been mixed so far, according to Sky's Technology Correspondent Tom Cheshire. Mr Cook said: ""The Apple Watch is the most personal device we have ever created. It is not just with you, it is on you. Gallery: A Look At The New Apple Watch The new device will carry a host of features which Apple hopes will make the watch a winner ""And since what you wear is an expression of who you are, we designed Apple Watch to appeal to a whole variety of people with different tastes and different preferences. ""But the one thing that is consistent is we crafted each one of them with the care you would expect from Apple and used incredibly beautiful materials."" Industry watchers are keen to see if Apple's version will be the tipping point for the smartwatch market, which has proved sluggish so far. There was similar scepticism when Apple launched the iPad in 2010, but the company has gone on to sell millions of the tablets and its popularity has shaken up the PC market. The Apple Watch will be the first new device the company has launched without co-founder Steve Jobs, who died in 2011. Every watch will have different faces and different configurations to choose from, including traditional and digital faces. Gallery: Apple Watch: What It's Up Against The Samsung Gear is one of the rivals to the Apple Watch. Features include a camera and a super AMOLED screen, and you can also use it to control your TV Mr Cook told those gathered in San Francisco, California, that you can add the date of your next meeting or check your heart rate. Users will also be able to receive calls with a built-in speaker and microphone. A technology called Digital Touch will allow Apple Watches to connect to one another, meaning you can get a friend's attention by tapping on your watch. The Apple Watch, which Mr Cook said will last for 18 hours on a typical day, tracks your daily movements and reminds users if they have been sitting down for too long. People will be able to view photos, control music and receive notifications that they currently get on an iPhone - such as news alerts and social media updates. Despite the high price for some of the models, many industry experts are predicting the Apple Watch will be a success. Gallery: A Legacy: Apple Products Timeline The Apple II was the first computer that Apple made in large numbers. It was released in 1977 Tom Parsons, reviews editor at gadget magazine Stuff, said: ""The price is really high, but that's not going to put gadget fans off stumping up the cash for an Apple Watch."" Ernest Doku, technology expert at comparison site uSwitch.com, said: ""Apple claims this is the most advanced timepiece ever created, but some of the features seem like the tech giant was scraping the barrel for unnecessary unique selling points. ""Digital Touch is essentially a personalised emoticons app with slightly classier graphics, for example. ""But gimmicks aside, this really is a elegant and luxurious gadget, while also being extremely useful for health and fitness fans, who it's heavily targeted at."""
2015-03-10,"The City regulator says payday loan customers in arrears are still being failed by companies, despite new rules to improve how they are treated.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150310154446/http://news.sky.com/story/1441939/payday-loan-customers-in-arrears-still-failed,"The City regulator says payday loan customers in arrears are still being failed by companies, despite new rules to improve how they are treated. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it had found ""serious non-compliance and unfair practices"" in all firms that it reviewed since taking over regulation of the sector in April last year. Its report identified poor outcomes for many customers and in some cases ""serious detriment and financial loss"". The watchdog said reviews of three firms, which it did not identify, revealed a backlog of letters and documentation, including from vulnerable customers who had fallen behind in repayments. This documentation, the FCA said, included medical evidence and letters from debt advisers providing crucial information about why some customers were failing to pay. Upon further investigation it was revealed that some of these customers were still being pursued by collection agents. The regulator said firms are required to give customers ""breathing space"" from collections activity if they provide evidence that they are working with a debt adviser to manage their debts. The FCA found further examples of actions that may have exacerbated already stressful situations, including repayment plans that were clearly unsustainable and subsequently failed, and customers having to explain their situation multiple times as a result of poor record keeping. Where situations of non-compliance were uncovered, the FCA said it had intervened quickly to get firms to take specific steps to ensure the failings were not repeated in the future, including appropriate levels of redress. It confirmed it had restricted the ability of a firm to do business until improvements were made. The industry has been subjected to a series of new rules aimed at ensuring customers are treated fairly and the FCA said some progress had been made. The results of its review were revealed just weeks after a 20-month investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said online payday lenders would be forced to publish details of their products on at least one price comparison website. The crackdown on payday lenders has sparked a wave of loan firm closures. Wonga - Britain's best-known payday lender - confirmed in February it was cutting a third of its workforce as it shrank its operations in response to the new industry rules. The company said it had to cut costs by £25m over two years but committed to operate ""fairly and responsibly"". Tracey McDermott, director of supervision at the FCA, said: ""Our rules are designed to ensure loans are affordable; that customers who get into difficulty are treated fairly and that they are not pressurised into unaffordable and unsustainable repayment plans. ""The real test for these lenders will be FCA authorisation where they will have to demonstrate exactly how much progress they have made if they want to remain in the market""."

Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and Amira Abase, 15, boarded a flight from Gatwick Airport bound for Istanbul last month. Authorities feared the teenagers, who attended Bethnal Green Academy in east London, were seeking to join the Islamist militants. Sky's Chief Correspondent Stuart Ramsay said: ""We're being told tonight that they've crossed into Syria through a crossing... which is not too far from Kilis. ""They're now apparently in a house that is owned or controlled - or at least hosted by - a British girl who had been in contact with them through the internet, and had brought them through Turkey and into Syria. ""We are told by... good sources within the city of al Raqqa that they are there, that they are safe. ""That is where they are staying - with this British girl who is hosting them. ""There's been a lot of discussion about where they are, (and) how they got there. But we are told they are now inside Syria, they are inside al Raqqa, and they are under the control of Islamic State."" Last week CCTV footage emerged which appeared to show the three teenagers at a bus station in Istanbul. The girls were seen wrapped in heavy winter jackets, two with hoods pulled up, and carrying packed sports bags and holdalls. The footage was recorded in the early hours of 18 February, less than 24 hours after the trio left their London homes, telling their families they would be out for the day. Gallery: Three Schoolgirls From East London Go Missing These pictures were taken from Kadiza Sultana (l) and Shamima Begum's (r) Twitter accounts The Metropolitan Police earlier disclosed that the three girls were questioned by officers in December as part of a ""routine inquiry"". None of the three was subsequently monitored by counter-terrorism police, according to The Times. It was only when their families raised the alarm that authorities discovered the girls had fled the country. Gallery: Fighting IS Militants In Iraq A Shi'ite fighter launches a rocket during clashes with Islamic State militants on the outskirts of al Alam Sky News uncovered a tweet sent from Shamima Begum's Twitter account two days earlier, asking a friend already in Syria to follow her so they can start messaging privately.

2015-03-10,A gold ring has been returned to the sister of the World War Two airman who died when his plane came down in Albania in 1944.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150310154446/http://news.sky.com/story/1441731/downed-ww2-airmans-ring-returned-to-sister,"A gold ring has been returned to the sister of the World War Two airman who died when his plane came down in Albania in 1944. Dorothy Webster was handed the wedding band at a special ceremony that was the culmination of an extraordinary series of events. Her brother, Flight Sergeant John Thompson, was given the ring when he married Joyce Mozeley in June 1944. He spent just a weekend with his wife before being posted abroad from where he took part in sorties to supply Albanian rebels. The ring was found by Albanian Jaho Cala in 1960 while he was collecting metal and wood in the mountains of the then Stalinist state. It took another 55 years, and the chance finding of the plane, before he was able to return it to Sgt Thompson's family. Albanian Xhemil Cala puts the ring on Dorothy Webster's finger At the ceremony in Albania's Defence Ministry, Mr Cala's son Xhemil kneeled as he handed the ring to Mrs Webster, along with a fuel gauge from the aircraft and a piece of rock from the mountain that brought it down. Defence Minister Mimi Kodheli told Mrs Webster: ""Your brother helped to liberate my country. He will never be forgotten."" Mrs Webster said she was ""overwhelmed ... getting all these keepsakes that we never thought we would ever get"". ""I remember him very well, as if it were yesterday,"" she added. The clue to the owner of the ring were the words ""Joyce & John"" engraved on the inside. Jaho Cala had no idea whose it was when he found it but decided he was determined to give it back to the owner. Albania's Defence Minister Mimi Kodheli and Dorothy Webster Xhemil Cala, said: ""He gave it to me when I got married in 1971, but told me clearly the ring did not belong to our family and I was to return it to its owner after communism ended."" The Albanian tried several ways of locating the owner of the ring including asking fellow Albanians who were visiting Britain to help In desperation he appealed to a regional government official, who contacted the British Embassy about two years ago. Then, in October last year, a British-US expedition found the remains of a Handley Page Halifax bomber 6,000ft (1,829m) up in the Albanian mountains. One of those who was part of the expedition Chris Casey said: ""Clearly what we found was enough to suggest we had found the remains of a big four-engine bomber. A Handley Page Halifax bomber ""The ring ... really helped us to solve this riddle."" Gerd Kaceli, a military assistant at the British embassy, said Sgt Thompson's plane dropped supplies in the Biza valley in Albania before it came down. It was the only plane out of 14 supplying anti-fascist fighters in Albania on 29 October, 1944, not to return. On turning west to return to Italy it clipped the top of a mountain and crashed, killing the crew, Mr Kaceli said. It was listed as ""missing and assumed to have crashed"", according to military records. Sgt Thompson's widow remarried after the war and died in 1995."

Simon, who had colon cancer, won nine Emmy awards for his work as a writer, director and executive producer of the animated sitcom. The show about a bumbling father, Homer, and his dysfunctional but loving family was first broadcast in 1989. Simon spent four seasons working on The Simpsons Hank Azaria, who provided his voice for Simpsons characters including bartender Moe, tweeted: ""Rest in peace and thank you for The Simpsons, Sam Simon."" Before helping launch The Simpsons, Simon worked as a writer for several hit TV shows, including Taxi, Cheers and The Tracey Ullman Show. He left The Simpsons after the series' fourth season under a deal that allowed him to continue receiving royalties from the show. Simon made a midlife career shift into philanthropy and channelled much of his personal fortune into social causes including animal welfare. He established The Sam Simon Foundation, which rescues dogs from animal shelters and trains them to assist the disabled. The organisation paid tribute to its founder on Facebook, writing: ""We all miss him, and in his honor, we will continue bringing his vision to light through our work at The Sam Simon Foundation.

Prabha Arun Kumar was taking a shortcut through Parramatta Park at around 9.30pm on Saturday when she was murdered in what police say was a ""horrific"" attack. She was just 300 metres from home when the killer stabbed her repeatedly in the neck. Mrs Kumar was found by a passer-by but died in hospital from massive blood loss. Police have been at the murder scene in Parramatta Park ""She was walking while talking to [her husband] on the phone when she said that a suspicious-looking man was following her,"" brother-in-law Thrijesh Jayachandra told Indian newspaper The Hindu. ""The next moment he heard her scream for help and then plead with the man not to harm her and take all her belongings if he wanted. ""Seconds later, he heard her scream and say she was stabbed."" Police have released CCTV of Mrs Kumar walking from Parramatta Railway Station. ""Here we have an Indian national who has been in the country for some time, going about her business and ends up being killed in a very vicious way,"" said New South Wales homicide squad commander Michael Willing. ""It's a horrific crime. It's a very, very disturbing crime. ""We think that she sustained a number of injuries to the neck area with what we believe is a sharp-edged weapon."" Commander Willing said there was nothing to suggest the murder was racially motivated but that they were examining all possibilities. Mrs Kumar, a 41-year-old IT worker, was planning to move back to India in April to be reunited with her nine-year-old daughter. Her husband has now flown to Australia to help with the investigation."

Speaking exclusively to Sky News, ""Saleh"" said he was employed by a Turkish man in the group to reassure hostages their lives were not in danger - yet he says he always knew they would be killed. Saleh said the execution rehearsals took place so that when the moment of death finally came the hostages were not expecting to be killed and were relaxed to appeal for their release on camera. He said: ""He would say to me 'say to them, no problem, only video, we don't kill you, we want from your government [to] stop attacking Syria. We don't have any problem with you; you are only our visitors'. ""So they don't worry. Always I say to them 'don't worry, doesn't matter, nothing dangerous for you'. But at the end I was sure [they would die]. ""Maybe they [the captors] raise their voice, but without hitting. All the time he say to him 'it's a rehearsal, don't [be] afraid'. ""I will explain. He want, when he will kill you really… [it] don't enter his [hostage's] head. Exactly, of course, you [hostages] should say this message: 'I'm living in ISIS and will stay and continue'."" Saleh worked as a translator before he was employed by IS. He fled across the border to Turkey to escape the group and claims to have looked after a hostage with an English accent. He said: ""This man from England, or Netherlands, I don't know. He was speaking English so nice. Sometimes I don't understand what he say. ""He was with mask. All questions around gun, around job in Syria. 'Who send you to Syria? Who is your partner there? When you came into Syria? Where you stayed in Idlib? In Aleppo?' All thing [the time he] give answer. 'No, I'm press, I'm press'. ""So after that he said to me, the Turkish man, 'don't worry, don’t worry'. After that he was so afraid."" Saleh claimed hostages were given Arabic names to convince them they were amongst friends in order to calm them down. He says Kenji Goto was given the name ""Abu Saad"". ""ISIS gave the hostages an idea; 'You should be Muslim and come with us'. When I went to the rehearsal he said to [Kenji] Goto 'Abu Saad'. Maybe I was thinking to myself 'maybe they try [find] this name so hard, 'Kenji Goto'. ""Maybe they could not say [Kenji Goto] so [they say] Abu Saad. But when I noticed Goto, when they said Abu Saad to Goto, direct [he] relax."" ""Saleh"" said Mohammed Emwazi, known as Jihadi John, is employed as the chief killer of foreign hostages for Islamic State's media wing and that his murderous influence among the group is feared and respected."

With membership quadrupling in the last year, 1,300 delegates packed out Liverpool's conference centre. It comes after a widely mocked radio interview with leader Natalie Bennett went viral. She struggled to explain how party policies would be paid for and blamed a bad cold for her performance. So how would Natalie Bennett cope trying to explain the policies announced at Party Conference? Abolish tuition fees Cough-o-meter: 1 (No Need For Strepsils) Likely to be very popular with the young people who are an important voter base for the Greens. Could help them mop up some dissatisfied Lib Dems. Banning almost all cars Cough-o-meter: 5 (A Hacking Cough) The current transport policy would ""ban almost all currently roadworthy cars,"" by requiring technology to stop them breaking the speed limit. A motion to change the policy admits ""this would probably prove unattractive with the electorate."" You can say that again. Providing free universal childcare Cough-o-meter: 1 (No Need For Strepsils) The Greens would provide free childcare from ages one to six. Some would argue that the Greens need to prove they are economically credible, but this is likely to be a popular policy that would help parents with the prohibitive cost of raising a family. Give everyone a citizens income of £71 a week Cough-o-meter: 4 (A Spluttering Sneeze) The Greens want to give everyone living in Britain - no matter how wealthy - £71 a week. The ""Citizen's Income"" would cost up to £280bn. The party says this is a long term ambition rather than concrete policy going into the 2015 election - but the thought of giving millionaires more money is likely to be a voter turn-off. Decriminalise cannabis Cough-o-meter: 2 (A Tickle In The Throat) Drug possession would be decriminalised, along with the cannabis trade. This is likely to be unpopular among many voters but will win support among the Green's core base. Cosying up to SNP to keep Tories out Cough-o-meter: 2 (A Tickle In The Throat) The Greens are in talks with the SNP ahead of a potential hung Parliament and have said they will do what they can to keep the Conservatives out of government. This could go down well with their left-wing voters but how influential are the Greens likely to be with - at best - just a couple of MPs?"

The former translator said that the masked man in the video was indeed Mohammed Emwazi, the 26-year-old Londoner who has become the face of the world's most notorious terrorist organisation. ""Saleh"" said Emwazi is employed as the chief killer of foreign hostages for Islamic State's media wing and that his murderous influence among the group is feared and respected. Kenji Goto, 47, was killed by Islamic State earlier this year Speaking from Turkey, where he fled to escape IS, Saleh explained in broken English how he was employed by the group to convince foreign hostages they were safe. He is the only person to admit seeing Emwazi kill. He said: ""When he killed Kenji Goto I live showed this [saw this] but not near, from a little [distance]. ""After he was killed him, three or four person come and take over the body and put in a car. After that, John went on a different road. ""The big boss was there with them. Turkish man say 'put this camera there, change place there' but John [was] the big boss. All time, all time say to all 'fastly, fastly, fastly, we should finish'. So respect him. Only he talks orders – others do."" Saleh suggested Emwazi commanded such respect within the group because of his willingness to murder foreigners.  ""Maybe because he use the knife,"" he said. ""I cannot understand why he is so strong. One man can kill and all people will respect. A Syrian man anyone [in IS] can kill. But strangers [foreigners], only John."" Saleh claims foreign hostages captured and murdered by the group were subjected to numerous mock executions until the procedure became normal. It could explain why many hostages appeared calm in execution videos published online by the group. He said: ""He would say to me 'say to them, no problem, only video, we don't kill you, we want from your government [to] stop attacking Syria. We don't have any problem with you; you are only our visitors'.

""We are teaching them in schools the real Islam; we teach them in their houses, we have books, we have leaflets to tell them what the real Islam is,"" he said.

""His father has a British nationality so probably he will come back to your country.""  Emwazi's former family lawyer says Western intelligence has provided no evidence that Emwazi is ""Jihadi John"" - something the ambassador refused to confirm or deny. ""This is in the hands of the British ... he came from the United Kingdom, he lived his life there - I think we should check every element to make sure that he is, or he is not."" Mr Al-Duwaisan did confirm that Kuwait is consulting with the UK. He said: ""We have full cooperation on these fields and with the United Kingdom as a truly friend and close friend of us we share information and anything that that is of concern or connected to ISIS, because we are a member of the alliance that wishes to eliminate IS from our society, from Iraq from Syria from countries including your country."""
2015-03-13,"Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude has insisted the Government is ""not protecting anyone"" over child abuse despite refusing to reveal the titles of four secret files.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150313092127/http://news.sky.com/story/1443825/abuse-files-whitehall-not-protecting-anyone,"By Tom Parmenter, Sky News Correspondent Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude has insisted the Government is ""not protecting anyone"" over child abuse despite refusing to reveal the titles of four secret files. The existence of the files was revealed by the Cabinet Office last month but officials have refused to disclose the contents or even the names of the documents, prompting widespread criticism. After five weeks of avoiding questions about the secret files Mr Maude told Sky News: ""We are not protecting anyone, we are ensuring that these documents are being made available to the inquiry. ""That is what people are entitled to expect, they are entitled to expect that the inquiry will have control of these matters."" The inquiry is due to start next month and will be led by New Zealand judge Justice Lowell Goddard. The Home Secretary has now confirmed that the panel that will assist Justice Goddard will include barrister Drusilla Sharpling, Professor Alexis Jay - who revealed the extent of the Rotherham abuse scandal - barrister and child protection expert Ivor Frank and Malcolm Evans who, among other things, is chair of the UN's Subcommittee for the Prevention of Torture. Their task will not be constrained by any cut off dates, Theresa May said, but will remain an inquiry for England and Wales and not focus directly on Northern Ireland where there have been allegations of high profile figures abusing youngsters boys at the Kincora children's home in Belfast. The inquiry may last for three years or more and survivors have said they simply do not believe the Government's repeated promises on transparency while file names remain secret in Westminster. MPs, campaigners and even Home Office Minister Lynne Featherstone have also called for the files to be published. Labour MP John Mann has branded the secrecy at the Cabinet Office a ""national disgrace"". The brother of Martin Allen, who vanished in London in 1979, called the decision to withhold the titles ""disgusting"". Kevin Allen believes there is a very strong chance that his disappearance 35 years ago is connected to a VIP abuse network that was operating in and around Westminster. Mr Maude said: ""I understand the concern there is and I understand how agonising this is for families who have suffered loss in that way, I completely understand that, but we have respect the inquiry, they have got their process to go through, they have got to do this and it wouldn't be right for us to pre-empt that in this way. The four files only came to light in February after Sky News unearthed another file held by the Cabinet Office documenting the ""unnatural"" sexual behaviour of the late diplomat Sir Peter Hayman. After pressure in Parliament the Cabinet Office released the Hayman files which showed Margaret Thatcher was aware of his activities. None of the five files were found during a Government-commissioned review of relevant files carried out last year. The Metropolitan Police team investigating allegations centred on Westminster has already spoken to 1,000 people and Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan Howe has reaffirmed his officers' determination to get to the truth."
2015-03-13,"Nigel Farage, David Cameron and Ed Miliband were embroiled in a Twitter spat following the UKIP leader's comments that race equality laws should be scrapped.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150313092127/http://news.sky.com/story/1443462/pm-farage-race-views-deeply-concerning,"Nigel Farage, David Cameron and Ed Miliband were embroiled in a Twitter spat following the UKIP leader's comments that race equality laws should be scrapped. Mr Farage said race discrimination laws in the workplace were no longer necessary and should be abolished. His comments drew fire from David Cameron on Twitter who accused him of ""attention seeking"" and Ed Miliband, who described the remarks as ""dangerous"". Mr Farage immediately returned fire accusing Mr Cameron of not caring and Mr Miliband of believing only in bureaucracy. Speaking in an interview with the former equalities chief Trevor Phillips, Mr Farage said the worries over discrimination by employers would have been valid 40 years ago but not now. Mr Farage, who described UKIP as ""colour blind"", said: ""I think the situation that we now have, where an employer is not allowed to choose between a British-born person and somebody from Poland, is a ludicrous state of affairs. ""I would argue that the law does need changing, and that if an employer wishes to choose, or you can use the word 'discriminate' if you want to, but wishes to choose to employ a British-born person, they should be allowed to do so."" Mr Farage was described as ""wrong and desperate for attention"" by Number 10 and was accused of ""breathtaking ignorance"" by Labour. Nick Clegg also said he disagreed with Mr Farage's comments. Mr Cameron tweeted: ""Nigel Farage is attention seeking. The laws protect people from racial discrimination. It's deeply concerning he doesn't understand that."" Mr Farage immediately hit back posting: ""@David_Cameron The people the law doesn't protect are British workers, black or white. Disturbing, though unsurprising, that u don't care."" Mr Miliband tweeted: ""I think Nigel Farage's comments today are wrong, divisive and dangerous. The laws we have on equality represent our values as a country."" To which Mr Farage replied: ""@Ed_Miliband The laws don't represent these values, Ed. The British people do. We believe in Britain. You believe in bureaucracy."" During the Channel 4 interview, Mr Farage also said people were more worried there were Muslims who wanted to form a ""fifth column and kill us"" and that there had not previously been a group who wanted to ""change who we are"". He said: ""So don't be surprised if there isn't a slight increase in people's worries and concerns. ""You know, when you've got British, when you’ve got people, born and bred in Cardiff, with British passports, going out to fight for Isis, don't be surprised if there isn't an uptick in concern."" He added: ""There is an especial problem with some of the people who’ve come here and who are of the Muslim religion who don't want to become part of our culture. ""So there is no previous experience, in our history, of a migrant group that comes to Britain, that fundamentally wants to change who we are and what we are. ""That is, I think, above everything else, what people are really concerned about."" Shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said: ""This is one of the most shocking things I have ever heard from a mainstream politician and demonstrates breathtaking ignorance. ""We have made huge progress on tackling racial inequality and discrimination in this country, partly because of Labour's strong anti-discrimination laws, but things are still far from perfect."" It comes as Gillian Duffy, who famously tackled Gordon Brown about the immigration issue during the 2010 election campaign, told Sky News she would be voting for Labour and not for UKIP."
2015-03-13,"Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson is facing new allegations over the ""fracas"" at a Yorkshire Dales hotel that led to his suspension by the BBC on Monday.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150313092127/http://news.sky.com/story/1444054/family-clarkson-said-hed-have-colleague-fired,"By Gerard Tubb, North of England Correspondent Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson is facing new allegations over the ""fracas"" at a Yorkshire Dales hotel that led to his suspension by the BBC on Monday. Four members of the same family who overheard the row say Clarkson told a colleague he would have him fired because there was no hot food at the end of a day's filming. The Ward family from Leeds told Sky News that Clarkson ranted for up to half-an-hour at the Simonstone Hotel near Hawes and say they were shocked at his language and the way he treated his colleague. They also claimed he criticised the BBC, saying it was ""getting worse"". A picture taken by the Wards of Clarkson the morning after the fracas Sue Ward, 54, a medical receptionist, described Clarkson's behaviour towards the unnamed employee as shocking. ""He said he hadn't done his job properly, it was ridiculous that there was nothing to eat, obviously there was lots of expletives in between all this, and that he would be losing his job, he would see to it that he would lose his job,"" she said. ""Even someone who's really inept at their job should be told properly, in a proper manner,"" she said ""But the fact that it was in a public place, I didn't want to listen to that language."" Sue's brother in law Bob Ward, 60, said Clarkson arrived with his co-presenters by helicopter at around 9.30pm and refused to have his picture taken. ""I said 'Any chance of a selfie Jeremy?' and he said 'No, not with the day I've had today'."" Within minutes, Bob's wife Denise, 51, said Clarkson was shouting and swearing and had spoiled the evening they had been looking forward to. ""We were sort of, 'Ooh, celebrities, will we see them?' and then it was just the shock of how can someone be so rude?"" she said. ""It was just the swearing and the length of time and this poor guy that he was ripping into,"" she added. Top Gear is the BBC's biggest global brand, worth more than £50m a year, but with Clarkson suspended the next three episodes have been scrapped. The only Top Gear fan among the Ward family, Sue's husband Alan, 56, agreed with the three quarters of a million people who have signed an online petition for Clarkson to keep his job. ""He's brash, we know what he's like, he's been in trouble before and I think he'll be in trouble again,"" he said. ""I think he'll continue to do that job because without Clarkson there's no Top Gear."" Sky News has approached Clarkson for a comment but he has not responded. Meanwhile, it has emerged that Clarkson’s Twitter profile has changed from saying, ""I am a presenter on the BBC2 motoring show, Top Gear"" to ""I am probably a presenter on the BBC2 motoring show, Top Gear"". One fan responded by tweeting ""brilliant"", while an opponent wrote ""You'll soon be changing the verb tense in your profile then?"""
2015-03-13,"Spies have been sacked for ""inappropriately accessing personal information"" held in bulk personal datasets, it has emerged.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150313092127/http://news.sky.com/story/1443723/spies-sacked-over-personal-information-breaches,"By Tom Cheshire, Technology Correspondent Spies have been sacked for ""inappropriately accessing personal information"" held in bulk personal datasets, it has emerged. The Intelligence and Security Committee's report into security and privacy - which began in July 2013 as a result of Edward Snowden's disclosures - reveals for the first time the existence of the bulk personal datasets. These are ""large databases containing personal information about a wide range of people"" which are not subject to any legislation. The Prime Minister said these datasets would be put on a statutory footing underneath the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA). NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden Intelligence and Security Committee spokeswoman MP Hazel Blears told Sky News that spies who illicitly access personal data gathered by intelligence agencies should face criminal charges. When asked by Sky News for further details about why intelligence staff were sacked, Ms Blears replied: ""I think we say in the report that these incidents have been extremely rare. ""We also recommend in our report that these matters should be a criminal offence because we regard this as extremely serious indeed. ""If you're trying to get public confidence around privacy then if someone breaches the rules then there ought to be severe sanctions for that kind of breach. ""We're not in a position today to give you the detailed information ... but I think the fact the committee recommends it be a criminal offence gives an indication of how seriously we take it."" The ISC report stated that GCHQ's bulk interception programme did not amount to ""blanket surveillance, nor does it equate to indiscriminate surveillance"". It said that the report contained ""an unprecedented amount of information about those capabilities"". However, much of the report was heavily redacted. The amount of communications collected by GCHQ was not disclosed, nor was specific instances where bulk interception prevented threats to the UK. The committee said thousands of private communications are read by GCHQ spies on a daily basis using bulk interception methods. In a section of the report that is heavily redacted, the committee said it is ""unavoidable that some innocent communications may have been incidentally collected"". The ISC said that laws governing the security services are ""unnecessarily complicated and - crucially - lacks transparency"". It called for a single Act of Parliament to replace all current legislation. The report also looked at GCHQ's efforts to break encrypted communications. The report acknowledged the existence of a GCHQ programme dedicated to this task, although its name was redacted. The ISC asked GCHQ whether this programme ""exposed the public to greater risk"", and could have a commercial impact on UK communications companies, undermining trust in digital services like secure banking. The director of GCHQ Robert Hannigan said: ""The risk, the point about large scale damage to the internet, I believe is wrong, it is misplaced."" GCHQ's computer network exploitations - hacking into others' computer systems - were also detailed, to an extent. The number of GCHQ hacks was redacted. The report said: ""The agencies may undertake IT operations against computers or networks in order to obtain intelligence."" It called for a specific authorisation regime for such attacks. Earlier this year, the Franco-Belgian SIM card manufacturer Gemalto said it believed it had been hacked either by GCHQ or the NSA. Shami Chakrabarti, director of rights campaign group Liberty, said: ""The ISC has repeatedly shown itself as a simple mouthpiece for the spooks - so clueless and ineffective that it's only thanks to Edward Snowden that it had the slightest clue of the agencies' antics."""

2015-03-13,It begins with a provocatively named documentary and ends with a Twitter spat involving Britain's best-known political leaders.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150313092127/http://news.sky.com/story/1443744/race-ukips-black-and-white-issue,"It begins with a provocatively named documentary and ends with a Twitter spat involving Britain's best-known political leaders. Nigel Farage's comments in Things We Won't Say About Race That Are True were clearly designed to stir up controversy. In a nutshell his argument was this: that UKIP is colour blind; racism virtually dead (just ask his children); and so, anti-discrimination laws are no longer necessary. Mr Farage says he is trying to protect all those British born from a new and different threat - the arrival of eastern Europeans searching for work. Enter David Cameron and Ed Miliband, with their angry tweets. Gallery: Farage Race Row Twitter Spat The Prime Minister accused Mr Farage of ""attention seeking"" And straight back at them from Mr Farage, who said to the Prime Minister the argument that today's law ""doesn't protect British workers, black or white"". And he added, to the opposition leader, that ""the laws don't represent these values, Ed. The British people do"". This all goes to the heart of UKIP's strategy on immigration and race. The party has worked hard to dispel any suggestion of racist tendencies by focusing instead on the latest arrivals to Britain - a group who you may have noticed are white. This row allows them to go a step further, by claiming their attacks on eastern European immigration are all about defending non-white Britons. In fact, Mr Farage has now claimed that mass immigration is fuelling high unemployment rates among black people in this country. And he is also giving a significant proportion of the population rhetoric that he knows they will lap up. We can see from the hundreds of thousands of people signing up in support of Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson that some people, at least, are itching to see high profile figures taking on political correctness. Unsurprisingly, Mr Farage has caused fury among those who say racism is still alive and kicking in Britain. They point to the offensive chants of Chelsea players on the Paris metro and evidence of discrimination in the work place. Take the shadow cabinet member Sadiq Khan, who welcomes the changes triggered by anti-discrimination laws but says Mr Farage is showing ""breath-taking ignorance"" if he thinks Britain has reached ""utopia"". And it is true that Office For National Statistics figures show a disparity in the unemployment rate - from 5.6% overall to 10.3% for those of Bangladeshi ethnicity; 14.3% for those of Pakistani heritage; and 15.5% for Black Africans and Caribbeans. Of course, we can't prove that employment discrimination is driving those figures but clearly something is going on in society that says a white person remains significantly more likely to find work than their brown or black counterpart. Other critics go further. They say that by claiming there is nothing racist about attacking Poles, Bulgarians or Romanians, he is simply opening the door to a new, form of discrimination that is just as dark as what preceded it."

The 2ft bronze was found by a member of the public early on Thursday in Surrey. It followed an appeal by police and Sarah's mother, Dr Sara Payne, who told Sky News the theft made her feel sick. She had feared the statue could be melted down for scrap. Sara Payne had asked the public to help find the statute The figure was given to Burhill County Primary School in Hersham, Surrey, in memory of their former pupil who was abducted and killed by Roy Whiting in 2000 when she was eight years old. It is thought it was stolen around 1am on Wednesday. It was found outside an address in Northfield Road in nearby Cobham, and believed to have been left outside the property between 5.15am and 7.30am. Three people are thought to have been involved in the theft. A van was also seen in the area around the time of the offence. Sergeant Marc Nettleingham, of Surrey Police, said: ""We are continuing to carry out a number of inquiries to identify the offenders responsible for this theft, which is particularly reprehensible... and the investigation is ongoing."""

Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the ""foreign spy"" working for one of the states in the US-led coalition had helped Kadiza Sultana, 16, Shamima Begum, 15, and Amira Abase, 15, get across the border. In an interview published on the official Anatolia news agency, he said: ""Do you know who helped those girls? He was captured. ""He was someone working for the intelligence (service) of a country in the coalition."" Mr Cavusoglu said the agent was not American, or from an EU state, but did not elaborate. Reports said the suspect was working for the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS). However, Canadian government sources sais they would not comment on ""operational matters of national security"". The three schoolgirls flew from Gatwick to Istanbul on 17 February and are feared to have continued to Syria to become so-called ""jihadi brides"". The girls, who all attended Bethnal Green Academy in East London, are believed to be staying in a house in the IS militants' stronghold Raqqa. The teenagers are thought to have stolen family jewellery to fund their trip, Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley told MPs earlier this week. They paid more than £1,000 in cash to a travel agent for their flights to Turkey, the Home Affairs Select Committee heard. It also emerged the trio were among seven schoolgirls who were handed letters by the police about another 15-year-old from Bethnal Green Academy who ran away to Syria in December. Relatives of the girls have demanded an apology from the Met for failing to send the crucial letter directly to their parents. Abase Hussein, Amira's father, said if he had seen the letter he would have talked his daughter out of leaving and taken away her passport. Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe apologised for failing to communicate more directly with the families - but insisted there was nothing more the force could have done to stop the girls leaving the UK. CCTV footage emerged last week which appeared to show the girls at a bus station in Istanbul. They were seen wrapped in heavy winter jackets and carrying packed sports bags and holdalls. Gallery: Three Schoolgirls From East London Missing These pictures were taken from Kadiza Sultana (l) and Shamima Begum's (r) Twitter accounts A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth said: ""We are aware that an arrest has been made by the Turkish National Police and that the Metropolitan Police have informed the families of the three girls. ""There has been close cooperation between ourselves and the Turkish authorities, and the Foreign Secretary is in regular contact with his Turkish counterpart.  As soon as the UK received this information it was acted upon appropriately."""

Bob Iger, speaking at Disney's annual shareholder meeting, also said there will be a spin-off from the franchise called 'Rogue One'. British star of The Theory of Everything and Oscar nominee Felicity Jones will star in Rogue One which will be released December 2016. The film is the first in a series of spin-offs that explore ""the characters and events beyond the core Star Wars saga"" a press release announcing the news revealed. Felicity Jones won plaudits for The Theory of Everything Little has been revealed about the plot, but Mr Iger said the idea came from John Knoll, a visual effects supervisor at Industrial Light and Magic - the special effects firm set up by George Lucas to help make the Star Wars films. The film will be directed by British filmmaker Gareth Edwards, who was widely acclaimed for Godzilla and independent movie Monsters which was made on a budget of less than £300,000. A spokesman for Disney said: ""The film starts shooting this summer in London and is due for release on December 16, 2016."" Episode 8 of the Star Wars series is due for release 40 years and a day after Star Wars: A New Hope first hit the screens in 1977. Mr Iger said it continues the saga after the events of Star Wars: The Force Awakens - episode 7, which is in production. The trailer for The Force Awakens has been viewed nearly 60 million times since it was posted on YouTube in December. The seventh film in the series is set for release in December this year and is expected to feature Imperial TIE fighters attacking the Millennium Falcon. Several X-wing fighters are also shown in the trailer flying just above water along with a shadowy hooded figure carrying a sword-style lightsabre in a snowy forest. British actor John Boyega features in the trailer and several of the original cast signed on to reprise their roles. Other new cast members are believed to include Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, Oscar Isaac, Domhnall Gleeson, Max von Sydow and Andy Serkis.

Ozcelik is accused of travelling by Eurostar from St Pancras to Brussels on 27 October and then trying to join the PKK. She faces one charge of engaging in conduct in preparation for giving effect to an intention to commit acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5 (1) (a) of the Terrorism Act 2006. The woman confirmed her name, age and address at the short hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court and was remanded to appear at the Old Bailey on 1 April. Her brother observed the proceedings from the public gallery. As she was led away she smiled and seemed to mouth ""it's okay"" to him."

Boy George, Steve Norman and Martin and Gary Kemp of Spandau Ballet were pallbearers at the service at All Saints Church in Porthcawl. The Visage singer's casket was adorned with colourful images from the band's heyday in the 1980s. The cortege was led by a marching jazz band before Visage's biggest hit Fade To Grey was played from a public address system. Strange was born Steven Harrington in Newbridge, Caerphilly, in 1959. He became a pioneer of the New Romantics with his music, dress sense and his role as a club promoter. Spandau Ballet members began hanging out at Strange's club nights and played early gigs at the Blitz Club in 1979 and 1980. Boy George had a job as a coat-check guy at the club.

Two state events have been cancelled in recent days and Mr Putin has not been seen in public since a meeting with Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi in Moscow on 5 March. A planned trip to Kazakhstan was postponed on Wednesday, with an unnamed Kazakh government official telling the Reuters news agency: ""It looks like he [Putin] has fallen ill."" The International Women's Day event may have taken place on 5 March The second engagement – a ceremony to formalise the controversial annexation of South Ossetia – was reportedly cancelled at such short notice that the South Ossetian delegation had already arrived in Moscow. The Russian leader was also not present at a meeting of the Federal Security Service on Thursday, which he has often attended in the past. Gallery: Vladimir Putin - Man Of Action Vladimir Putin has earned a reputation as something of an action man. Here in 2013 he is seen shaking hands with a walrus on a visit to the under-construction Primorsky Aquarium. ""There's no need to worry, he's absolutely healthy,"" Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the Echo of Moscow radio station. He said the agreement with South Ossetia would be signed next week and insisted the president had not planned to attend the security service meeting. ""Yes, he's usually there,"" Mr Peskov said. ""But this year he was not planning to be."" Asked whether Putin's handshake was still firm, Mr Peskov laughed and said: ""It breaks your hand."" However, he declined to say when the president would next make a public appearance. ""He has meetings all the time,"" Mr Peskov told Reuters. ""He has meetings today, tomorrow. I don't know which ones we will make public."" The Kremlin press service released an image on Wednesday purporting to show Vladimir Putin meeting the regional governor of Karelia, but several news agencies said the meeting had actually taken place on 4 March. Adding to the speculation, Russian business newspaper RBK said footage of the president congratulating women on International Women’s Day, posted on the Kremlin website on March 8, had been pre-recorded on 5 March. The 62-year-old rarely takes time off, and it is unusual for him to miss state events through illness. Mr Putin has cultivated an image as a physically-fit, strongman president, posing for photographs while hunting, swimming and riding a horse bare-chested, flying a fighter jet, and supposedly saving a TV crew from a tiger attack. It makes a stark and presumably deliberate contrast to the failing health of his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin, and to the succession of ailing, elderly leaders of the early 1980s, whose decline seemed to mirror that of the Soviet Union. Rumours about Mr Putin's health last surfaced in 2012 when the Russian president cancelled several trips and appeared to have developed a limp, but the Kremlin said that was due to a sports injury. In October Mr Putin's spokesman told journalists to ""shut their trap"" after an article suggested the president might have pancreatic cancer. Mr Peskov appeared to be trying to laugh off the latest speculation, accusing reporters on Thursday of ""spring madness""."

Sir Terry enjoyed stellar success with his Discworld series of comic fantasy novels, selling 70 million books worldwide. A tweet was posted announcing the author's death After being diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2007, he became an active campaigner for assisted dying. His death was announced on his Twitter account by his daughter in her father's own writing style. The first post said: ""AT LAST, SIR TERRY, WE MUST WALK TOGETHER."" In his books Death's words always appear in capitals. The next tweet said: ""Terry took Death’s arm and followed him through the doors and on to the black desert under the endless night."" And the last simply said: ""The End."" She later wrote: ""Many thanks for all the kind words about my dad. Those last few tweets were sent with shaking hands and tear-filled eyes."" A statement issued following his death said the best-selling writer passed away at his home with his cat sleeping on his bed surrounded by his family on Thursday. It said he battled the progressive disease with his trademark determination and creativity, and continued to write. He completed his last book, a new Discworld novel, in the summer of 2014, before succumbing to the final stages of the disease. Gallery: Terry Pratchett: A Life In Pictures May 1997: Pratchett relaxing in the garden of his home near Salisbury, Wiltshire Larry Finlay, MD at Transworld Publishers: ""I was deeply saddened to learn that Sir Terry Pratchett has died. The world has lost one of its brightest, sharpest minds. ""In over 70 books, Terry enriched the planet like few before him. ""As all who read him know, Discworld was his vehicle to satirise this world: he did so brilliantly, with great skill, enormous humour and constant invention. ""Terry faced his Alzheimer's disease (an 'embuggerance', as he called it) publicly and bravely. ""Over the last few years, it was his writing that sustained him. His legacy will endure for decades to come. ""My sympathies go out to Terry's wife Lyn, their daughter Rhianna, to his close friend Rob Wilkins, and to all closest to him."" Fellow author and Sir Terry's friend Neil Gaiman said: ""Thirty years and a month ago, a beginning author met a young journalist in a Chinese restaurant, and the two men became friends, and they wrote a book, and they managed to stay friends despite everything. ""Last night, the author died. ""There was nobody like him. I was fortunate to have written a book with him, when we were younger, which taught me so much. I'll miss you, Terry."" Alzheimer's Society chief executive Jeremy Hughes said: ""Sir Terry Pratchett fundamentally changed the way dementia is seen and understood. ""Shouting from the rooftops about the absurdity of how little funding dementia research receives, and fighting for good quality dementia care, he was and will remain the truest of champions for people with the condition."" A Just Giving page donating to the Research Institute to the Care of Older People (RICE) has been set up in his memory."

Scotland Yard said a 71-year-old man has been arrested under Operation Yewtree - the inquiry set up in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. Detectives have so far spoken to 17 people as part of the Metropolitan Police's Yewtree investigation which has been running since October 2012 Scotland Yard would not confirm the identity of the 71-year-old but said: ""This is not a new individual to Operation Yewtree. This is not an 18th individual."" The spokesman said the man has been arrested ""under the strand of the investigation we have termed Others"". He has been interviewed at a police station in Peterborough and inquiries are continuing. In November, Clifford lost an appeal to have his jail term cut with judges ruling it was ""justified and correct"". Clifford, 71, was jailed in May last year after a seven-week trial in which he was shown to be a manipulative sex offender who had abused a string of young women during his career. Many of his victims had been teenagers looking for work in show business. In court he dismissed the women as ""fantasists and liars"" who were making the allegations in pursuit of compensation. However, he was found guilty of eight sex attacks on four victims between 1977 and 1984. The judge said he also believed other ""supporting witnesses"" who had made serious allegations. He was jailed for eight years."
2015-03-13,A call by Nigel Farage to scrap laws banning discrimination in the workplace on grounds of nationality or race has provoked a huge outcry.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150313092127/http://news.sky.com/story/1443673/race-equality-at-work-how-the-law-works,"A call by Nigel Farage to scrap laws banning discrimination in the workplace on grounds of nationality or race has provoked a huge outcry. The UKIP leader says they are not required as race is no longer a significant issue in modern Britain. We examine the current legislation and look at employment sectors where there is room for improvement: Nigel Farage: 'Time for change' 1. When was racial discrimination law first brought in and what areas did it cover? The Race Relations Act 1965 was the first legislation in the UK to address the issue. It outlawed discrimination on the ""grounds of colour, race, or ethnic or national origins"" in public places. The Act also prompted the creation of The Race Relations Board (in 1966). 2. What happened next? The 1965 law was followed by the Race Relations Act 1968 which made it illegal to refuse housing, employment, or public services to a person on the grounds of colour, race, ethnic or national origins. It also created the Community Relations Commission to promote ""harmonious community relations"". The law was superseded (and repealed) by the Race Relations Act 1976, which, in turn, was replaced by the Equality Act 2010. 3. What does the 2010 Equality Act Do? The law, which largely consolidated previous legislation, makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against employees because of race, colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin. Under it there are deemed to be four types of race discrimination. :: Direct discrimination: Treating someone less favourably because of their actual or perceived race, or because of the race of someone with whom they associate. An example of this could be refusing to employ someone solely because they are a particular race :: Indirect discrimination: Can occur where there is a policy, practice or procedure which applies to all workers, but particularly disadvantages people of a particular race. An example could be a requirement for all job applicants to have GCSE Maths and English: people educated in countries which don't have GCSEs would be discriminated against if equivalent qualifications were not accepted. :: Harassment: When unwanted conduct related to race has the purpose or effect of violating an individual's dignity or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for that individual :: Victimisation: Unfair treatment of an employee who has made or supported a complaint about racial discrimination. 4. What does the law require employers to do? Gallery: UKIP Leader Nigel Farage: A Profile Nigel Farage has been married twice and has four children, two sons from his first marriage and two daughters from his second. He continues to live in Kent and cites fishing, country sports, traditional English pubs and getting Britain out of the EU as his interests. Employers must ensure they have policies in place which are designed to prevent discrimination in recruitment and selection, determining pay, training and development, selection for promotion, discipline and grievances, countering bullying and harassment. Under the Act, employers are allowed to take positive action, which enables them to provide support, training or encourage people from a particular racial group. However, they must ensure any positive action taken is proportionate and does not discriminate against people outside of that group. 5. How well is the 2010 Act working and are there are any particular areas of concern? Although progress has been made there are still many areas of employment where ethnic minorities are poorly represented, not least the boards of FTSE 100 companies. According to figures published by Green Park Executive Recruitment in December 2014, 62% of FTSE 100 boards were all white, and just 5.25% of board members were from ethnic minorities, compared to 14% in the British population as a whole. The figures for football club managers are similar, with just six coaches from ethnic minority backgrounds in charge at England’s 92 professional clubs. They are Chris Ramsey at QPR, Chris Hughton at Brighton, Chris Powell at Huddersfield, Fabio Liverani at Leyton Orient, Keith Curle at Carlisle and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink at Burton Albion."

David Duckenfield, former Chief Superintendent with South Yorkshire Police, was giving evidence for a third day at the new inquests into the death of 96 Liverpool fans at Hillsborough on 15 April, 1989. Under cross-examination Mr Duckenfield admitted his decision to open a side gate and let thousands of Liverpool fans into an already overcrowded stadium was a ""blunder of the first magnitude"". Rajid Monon, representing 75 Hillsborough families, suggested the admission was “hugely significant”. ""You knew that something horrific was unfolding. You could not handle the truth and that's why you lied,” he said. ""And once you lied the genie was out of the bottle and you could not put it back in. It marked, didn't it, the start of the police cover-up?"" Mr Duckenfield, 70, replied: ""I don't think I was involved in any cover-up whatsoever."" Mr Monon suggested: ""It was the beginning of a false narrative, a false story, about Hillsborough, wasn't it?"" ""I disagree,"" replied Mr Duckenfield. Mr Monon continued: ""A false narrative that sought to blame Liverpool fans for what had happened and concealed the truth about your failings and other senior police officers. That false narrative has sadly survived to this day."" ""There was no conspiracy as far as I’m concerned,"" Mr Duckenfield told the jury. Earlier Mr Duckenfield issued a dramatic apology to the families of those who died for what he described as a ""terrible lie"" in not admitting it was his order that resulted in Gate C being opened. Mr Monon asked why he waited 26 years to confess to lying. Mr Duckenfield said: ""I was possibly in denial. I never found a venue or an opportunity where I could meet with someone and speak to them honestly and openly and ensure that my thoughts and feelings would be reported fairly. ""This court gave me the opportunity to sit here and apologise fully for the first time without fear of anybody misrepresenting what I was saying."" Mr Monon asked: ""If the families and their supporters had not waged a courageous and unrelenting campaign that culminated in the High Court in 2012 quashing the determinations made at the original inquests, you would have never made the public admissions under oath that you have made this week, is that right?"" ""I don’t necessarily agree with that sir,"" replied Mr Duckenfield. Gallery: Hillsborough Report: Key Figures Sir Norman Bettison was involved in the original internal inquiry for South Yorkshire Police and is now chief constable of the West Yorkshire force. Insists he has ""nothing to hide"" However, he accepted his admissions could be seen as ""upsetting and infuriating"" and ""too little too late"". The jury heard how Mr Duckenfield had not realised fans would enter the stadium by two access tunnels when he gave the order to open the side gate. Mr Monon said: ""Your actions were so serious and fell so far below the standard expected of a reasonably competent match commander that it amounted to gross negligence. Do you agree?"" Mr Duckenfield replied: ""In my view it was not negligent and most certainly was not grossly negligent. ""It was a blunder of the first magnitude,"" said Mr Monon. ""Sir, I cannot deny that,"" Mr Duckenfield replied."

Adan Garar and two other people are believed to have died in the strike near the town of Bardhere in Somalia, US and Kenyan officials said. Garar was also suspected of planning failed attacks on Kenya's coastline and in the Ugandan capital of Kampala, according to a Kenyan official. Kenyan authorities said police foiled a planned attack in the coastal city of Mombasa in March 2014. The attack on the Westgate Mall was the largest in Kenya since 1998 Al Shabaab militants had planned to carry out simultaneous attacks on the city's airport, a ferry crossing and a supermarket. The attack was foiled when anti-terror police intercepted a car packed with explosives. Al Shabaab has vowed to carry out violent attacks in Kenya and Uganda in retaliation for the countries' contribution to the African Union force supporting Somalia's government. Some 67 people, including six Britons, were killed in the Westgate Mall attack in September 2013. The attack was the largest in Kenya since the 1998 bombings by al Qaeda of the US Embassy in Nairobi."
2015-03-15,Doctors have performed the world's first successful penis transplant.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150315031945/http://news.sky.com/story/1444513/docs-perform-first-successful-penis-transplant,"Doctors have performed the world's first successful penis transplant. The nine-hour operation by surgeons in Cape Town offers hope to high numbers of South African men who lose their penises due to complications with traditional circumcision. Experts thought the unnamed 21-year-old patient - who had to have his penis amputated three years ago after circumcision - would take two years to regain all function. However, it has taken just four months for this to occur - resulting in December's operation being declared a success. The surgery was five years in the planning at Stellenbosch University and Tygerberg Hospital. It was led by Professor Andre van der Merwe, who said: ""We are very surprised by his rapid recovery. ""It's a massive breakthrough. We've proved that it can be done - we can give someone an organ that is just as good as the one that he had. ""There is a greater need in South Africa for this type of procedure than elsewhere in the world, as many young men lose their penises every year due to complications from traditional circumcision."" The surgery has been attempted once before - but this is the first example of a successful long-term result. Experts estimate as many as 250 penis amputations take place every year across South Africa. ""This is a very serious situation,"" said Prof van der Merwe. ""For a young man of 18 or 19 years, the loss of his penis can be deeply traumatic. ""He doesn't necessarily have the psychological capability to process this. There are even reports of suicide among these young men. ""The heroes in all of this for me are the donor, and his family. They saved the lives of many people because they donated the heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, skin, corneas, and then the penis."" The transplant followed the path laid by the first facial transplant. ""We used the same type of microscopic surgery to connect small blood vessels and nerves, and the psychological evaluation of patients was also similar,"" said Prof van der Merwe. The procedure could eventually be extended to men who have lost their penises from penile cancer or as a last-resort treatment for severe erectile dysfunction."

The producers of Spectre asked the Welsh Assembly Commission if they could shoot scenes inside the Siambr in the Senedd in Cardiff. But officials said ""no"", telling the film-makers the main debating chamber for members of the Welsh National Assembly was not a ""drama studio"". But Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said it was ""a shame"" that the Bond series, which has made billions at the box office, would not be coming to Wales. Double No Senedd: Producers wanted to film inside the building He said: ""From a Welsh tourism perspective, that's the sort of publicity money can't buy. ""TV and film-related tourism is a major industry, bringing fans of Harry Potter, Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Who to Welsh locations. ""It's a shame that Spectre won't be added to that list."" Tory shadow health minister Darren Millar tweeted two political rivals, joking: ""We have the Chuckle Brothers in the Senedd on a weekly basis - @carlsargeant1 and @LeightonAndrews - why can't we have James Bond? #007"" Steve Sulley, president of South Wales Chamber of Commerce, wrote on Twitter: ""So the Welsh Assembly say NO to the new Bond Film filming inside The Senedd... genius decision making... NOT."" Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones retweeted posts from the official Welsh Government account, emphasising that the decision was taken by the Assembly Commission, rather than ministers. It is believed The Assembly Commission, which looks after the running of the institution, was approached by the makers of Spectre late last year. The film, which sees Daniel Craig return as Bond, has already started filming in locations including the Austrian Alps, Rome and the River Thames in central London. But Assembly officials argued it would be highly unlikely permission would ever be granted to film an action film on the floor of the House of Commons. They said other parts of the Assembly's estate had been offered for filming, but were turned down. The Commission said in a statement: ""The Senedd's Siambr is the home of Welsh democracy and seat of government for Wales. ""Some media activity is allowed in the Siambr when it relates to the work of the Assembly (but) it is not a drama studio. ""The request by (the producers of) James Bond to use the Siambr was turned down and they were offered alternative locations on the estate - which they subsequently declined."" The Senedd, which cost £69.6m, was officially opened in 2006. Sixty AMs sit in its Siambr - with its ""mushroom cloud"" style wooden ceiling and circular viewing gallery being lauded for its unique architecture and design. Spectre, the 24th James Bond film, is due for release in November."

The life-size artwork was created to reflect what the artists considered to be Doherty's ""crucifixion by the media"". It is part of an exhibition in St Marylebone Parish church in London and will be sold to the highest bidder to raise funds for the continuing search for the curator's missing brother. The fibreglass body sculpture, for which Doherty was smothered in alginate for five hours, hangs above the church's congregation. The cross carries damning written quotations from newspapers which have vilified the singer for his previous drug abuse. The Reverend Canon Stephen Evans, rector of St Marylebone, said: ""I think it's a very powerful piece, wonderfully produced by the artists. The sculpture is life-sized and made of fibreglass ""I especially love the way the so-called sins of Pete Doherty are named all around the cross. ""If the cross means anything to Christians it is the place where sins are done away with."" But not everyone believes it is an appropriate exhibit to be hanging in a church three weeks before Easter. Christian artist Sarah de Nordwall said: ""If it helps people to think about Christ that's wonderful, but the way it's set up it is not going to do that. ""It trivialises the sufferings of Christ and focuses on pop stars and the media."" The show is curated by artist Ben Moore, who will auction the exhibits to raise money so he and his family can continue the search across Europe for his brother Tom, who vanished 12 years ago. Tom Moore was a troubled and vulnerable man who had disappeared after developing mental health problems in his 20s. The artwork carries written quotations from newspapers His family have heard nothing from him since July 2003, when he left a note saying he was going out and may be some time. Ben Moore said: ""I have faith he is safe because he has gone before. He has not been drawn into the dark side of homelessness with drugs or whatever, other things people can fall into."" Ben said his brother was religious and may have joined a Christian group that is looking after him. ""I just want people to study his picture and let us know if they have seen him so we can go and bring him home."" The exhibition runs until Tuesday when the online auction ends. The Doherty sculpture was created by artists Schoony and Nick Reynolds, who is also a member of the Alabama 3 rock band. The sculpture has a reserve price of £13,000, but is not the most expensive in the show. Anyone who wants to bid can do so via the auction website."

Four members of the same family who overheard the row say Clarkson told a colleague he would have him fired because there was no hot food at the end of a day's filming. The Ward family from Leeds told Sky News that Clarkson ranted for up to half-an-hour at the Simonstone Hotel near Hawes and say they were shocked at his language and the way he treated his colleague. They also claimed he criticised the BBC, saying it was ""getting worse"". A picture taken by the Wards of Clarkson the morning after the fracas Sue Ward, 54, a medical receptionist, described Clarkson's behaviour towards the unnamed employee as shocking. ""He said he hadn't done his job properly, it was ridiculous that there was nothing to eat, obviously there was lots of expletives in between all this, and that he would be losing his job, he would see to it that he would lose his job,"" she said. ""Even someone who's really inept at their job should be told properly, in a proper manner,"" she said ""But the fact that it was in a public place, I didn't want to listen to that language."" Sue's brother in law Bob Ward, 60, said Clarkson arrived with his co-presenters by helicopter at around 9.30pm and refused to have his picture taken. ""I said 'Any chance of a selfie Jeremy?' and he said 'No, not with the day I've had today'."" Within minutes, Bob's wife Denise, 51, said Clarkson was shouting and swearing and had spoiled the evening they had been looking forward to. ""We were sort of, 'Ooh, celebrities, will we see them?' and then it was just the shock of how can someone be so rude?"" she said. ""It was just the swearing and the length of time and this poor guy that he was ripping into,"" she added. Top Gear is the BBC's biggest global brand, worth more than £50m a year, but with Clarkson suspended the next three episodes have been scrapped. The only Top Gear fan among the Ward family, Sue's husband Alan, 56, agreed with the three quarters of a million people who have signed an online petition for Clarkson to keep his job. ""He's brash, we know what he's like, he's been in trouble before and I think he'll be in trouble again,"" he said. ""I think he'll continue to do that job because without Clarkson there's no Top Gear."" Sky News has approached Clarkson for a comment but he has not responded. Meanwhile, it has emerged that Clarkson’s Twitter profile has changed from saying, ""I am a presenter on the BBC2 motoring show, Top Gear"" to ""I am probably a presenter on the BBC2 motoring show, Top Gear"". One fan responded by tweeting ""brilliant"", while an opponent wrote ""You'll soon be changing the verb tense in your profile then?"""

Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana all seem to appear in the footage and are talking to an Arab interpreter about a Syrian passport. It is believed the footage was filmed by an individual arrested by Turkish officials yesterday and accused of being a ""spy"" from Canada. The film was confiscated from the man after the girls were helped across the border into Syria to join militants, sources in Turkey said. Sky's Ashish Joshi said it was unclear where or when the film was taken, though it is believed to be somewhere in Turkey. ""By releasing this footage, by holding it up, Turkey is saying to the rest of the world 'we are doing everything we can to stop people travelling through our country to join IS',"" said Joshi. Yesterday, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu described the person who helped the girls cross into Syria as a ""foreign spy"". He said that the individual was working for one of the states in the US-led coalition. Mr Cavusoglu said the agent was not American, or from an EU state, but did not elaborate. Other reports said the suspect was working for the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS). However, Canadian government sources said they would not comment on ""operational matters of national security"". The three schoolgirls flew from Gatwick to Istanbul on 17 February and are feared to have continued to Syria to become so-called ""jihadi brides"". The girls, who all attended Bethnal Green Academy in East London, are believed to be staying in a house in the IS militants' stronghold Raqqa. The teenagers are thought to have stolen family jewellery to fund their trip, Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley told MPs. They paid more than £1,000 in cash to a travel agent for their flights to Turkey, the Home Affairs Select Committee heard. It also emerged the trio were among seven schoolgirls who were handed letters by the police about another 15-year-old from Bethnal Green Academy who ran away to Syria in December. Relatives of the girls have demanded an apology from the Met for failing to send the crucial letter directly to their parents."

Ellen Pao is suing her former employer, venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, which was an early investor in the likes of Amazon and Google. The hearings at San Francisco Superior Court, which is tweeting updates on the trial, have frequently been standing room only. The 45-year-old plaintiff faced tough questions on Friday about, among other things, her affair with a fellow partner at the company. Ms Pao, now interim chief executive of social news website Reddit, has testified that she and other women were passed over for advancement and endured harassment in a male-dominated culture at Kleiner. Ms Pao alleged harassment by male colleague Ajit Nazre (C) The plaintiff, who has a law degree and MBA from Harvard, says male senior partners took the credit for her work on successful investments. But Kleiner says Ms Pao was fired from her $560,000-a-year job in October 2012 because she lacked leadership and interpersonal skills. On Friday, Ms Pao's fifth day on the witness stand, the six men and six women of the jury had the opportunity to quiz her. Some US states allow jurors to pose their own questions in civil cases. She alleges the discrimination began after she complained about harassment from married male colleague Ajit Nazre, with whom she says she was pressured into having an affair in 2006. One juror asked if Ms Pao considered it ""appropriate professional behaviour to enter into an affair with a married man?"" She said: ""Going back I would not have done it again, but I didn't think it was inappropriate at the time."" She said Mr Nazre had told her his wife had left him. Ms Pao, who joined Kleiner in 2005, has testified that she and other women were barred from work trips on private jets and ski resorts. She also said she was not invited to an important Kleiner dinner with former US Vice President Al Gore. Kleiner has been trying to portray Ms Pao's lawsuit as financially motivated. The firm wanted to introduce evidence about Ms Pao and her husband's money troubles, including tax liens and bankruptcy. But Judge Harold Kahn denied the motion."

The cash will help more than 100,000 youngsters needing mental health services over the next five years, Nick Clegg announced. He said the way children had been treated before by the system was an ""institutionalised form of cruelty"". The £250m-a-year funding will be confirmed in next week's Budget. Mr Clegg made the announcement during a visit to Clock View Hospital in Liverpool. He said: ""I think it will have a huge impact. You have got, on average, three children in every classroom in our country who have got mental health problems and are not being properly catered for, not being properly identified, not being properly supported. ""This huge expansion - £1.25bn over the course of the next parliament - will help around 110,000 children, children who at the moment are being let down by the system. ""It's an institutionalised form of cruelty, the way we allow vulnerable children with mental health problems to basically have to fend for themselves at the moment. ""This big announcement I'm making is going to seek to change that. It won't happen overnight, it will happen over the coming years."" The funding will also help improve support for new mothers, who had previously struggled with a ""second-class mental health service"", Mr Clegg said. The Deputy Prime Minister said: ""It is terrifying to think that in this day and age some new mothers are having to travel miles for treatment and others are even being separated from their newborn child. This has to stop. ""This funding will make sure they get the treatment and support they need so they in turn can give their children the best possible start in life."" Mr Clegg was in Liverpool for the Liberal Democrats' spring conference. During his announcement he blamed some local NHS commissioners for failing to pass on previous funding for children's mental health."

It was the latest in a number of admissions made by the former South Yorkshire Police chief superintendent for the first time since he was match commander on the day of the 1989 tragedy. The 70-year-old has already confessed about ""mistakes"" he made and lies he told in the aftermath, and apologised ""unreservedly"" to fans' families. But during his third day of being cross-examined by lawyers of the relatives of the 96 who died, he denied his mind was focused on hooliganism rather than fans' safety. On the day of the disaster, police became overwhelmed by supporters at the turnstiles as kick-off neared and Mr Duckenfield gave the order at 2.52pm to open gates to let them in. Around 2,000 fans poured in through Gate C, many heading straight for a tunnel in front of them, which Mr Duckenfield had not ordered to be closed - a ""blunder of the first magnitude,"" the inquest jury heard. Mr Duckenfield insisted he had declared a major incident The tunnel led directly to the already full central pens on the Leppings Lane terrace. Ninety-six Liverpool fans died in the ensuing crush minutes later on the terraces of Sheffield Wednesday's Hillsborough ground as the FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest kicked off. Mr Duckenfield has said he initially thought the problem on the terrace was crowd disorder and only realised it was a ""medical emergency at 3.04pm"". But transcripts of tape recordings made at that time in the police control box where the match commander was stationed showed a subordinate officer calling for police dogs. Rajiv Menon QC, representing families of the victims, said: ""You must have asked him to do this. It's a medical emergency. Can you explain that? Why on earth do you need dogs at the stadium?"" Mr Duckenfield said he had ""no idea"" other than he wanted to create a ""secure area"" for the rescue operation. Mr Menon asked: ""So dogs requested, ambulances yet to be requested. Correct?"" The witness replied: ""It would appear so."" At 3.06pm Mr Duckenfield called for operational support, a request for all available officers in the force area to go to the stadium. Mr Menon asked: ""Why more manpower?"" Mr Duckenfield replied: ""To help the rescue."" Mr Menon responded: ""What rescue? You have yet to call for ambulances or fire crews."" Mr Duckenfield suggested the situation was different and simply looking at documents was ""flat and tells you nothing"". Mr Menon said police records did not record him declaring a major incident, which would have triggered a disaster rescue plan by emergency services. Mr Duckenfield insisted he had done so and there was an ""omission"" in the records. Mr Menon responded: ""This is a transcript of the tape."" The inquest heard that a request for a fleet of ambulances to attend Hillsborough was made around two minutes and 40 seconds after the call for back-up from dog-handlers. Jurors were also told that an officer at the scene made a call at 3.13pm for fire crews equipped with cutting gear to attend the scene. Mr Duckenfield agreed that the eight minutes represented a ""serious amount of time"" lost in the effort to save lives but said he was making decisions in a ""very critical"" situation."

Cyclone Pam is thought to have caused widespread destruction across the 65 inhabited Vanuatu islands, killing at least eight people, aid officials have said. Unconfirmed reports say dozens more people are feared dead after the storm, which is one of the strongest ever recorded. Communication systems in many of the outer islands remains down, meaning it could take some time before the full extent of the damage is known. Britain's Department for International Development said ""up to £1m"" will be made immediately available to UN organisations and international aid agencies already working in the region following a request from the Vanuatu government. An additional £1m will be made available through the UK's Rapid Response Facility, which provides emergency support. The Category Five storm - the highest on the scale - struck the South Pacific archipelago with winds of up to 168mph, threatening more than 267,000 residents. The storm blew roofs off houses, uprooted trees and downed power lines. Officials in the capital Port Vila say there is no power or running water. Save the Children's Vanuatu country director, Tom Skirrow, added: ""The scene here this morning is complete devastation."" Chloe Morrison, a World Vision emergency communications officer, said: ""The damage is quite extensive in Port Vila but there are so many more vulnerable islands."" Vanuatu is about a quarter of the way from Australia to Hawaii. About 47,000 people live in the capital. Most of those left their homes for the safety of shelters. Speaking in Japan, where he was at a conference on global risk, President of Vanuatu Baldwin Lonsdale choked up as he said: ""I stand to appeal on the behalf of the government and people of Vanuatu to the global community to give a lending hand in responding these very current calamities that have struck us."" New Zealand, which is braced for Pam's arrival in the next 12 hours, donated a million NZ dollars. Australia said it was preparing to send a crisis response team to Vanuatu if needed, while Save The Children launched an appeal for youngsters affected by the storm. Gallery: Fears Dozens Killed By Powerful Cyclone Pam There are fears dozens of people have been killed after Cyclone Pam stuck the Pacific's Vanuatu archipelago The cyclone had already destroyed some homes and caused damage to other Pacific islands including the Solomon Islands and Kiribati, 4,000km away from Vanuatu. Although the UK does give regular aid to Vanuatu, according to the DfiD website, the country is a member of the Commonwealth. International Development Secretary Justine Greening said: ""All our thoughts are with the people of Vanuatu as they start to assess the full scale of this disaster.

Prayers were said for those who were killed in the conflict, for families left behind while their loved ones served and for the Afghan people and its leaders. A Memorial Cross made from used shell cases was processed through St Paul's Cathedral by representatives from the RAF, Royal Navy and Army. After being blessed by the Archbishop, it was taken to the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire as part of a permanent installation. After the service, a parade of servicemen marched through the streets of London ending at the Guildhall in the City. It was made up of veterans representing many parts of the military.

The show's presenters were attacked as they left Argentina in 2014 A BBC spokesman said the show was not aware the word ""slope"" was considered by some to be offensive and insisted it was used to make a ""light-hearted wordplay joke"". Ofcom ruled that the programme breached broadcasting rules. :: ""N-word"" edited out of Top Gear broadcast (series 19, February 2013) Clarkson was accused by the Daily Mirror of using the ""n-word"" while filming an episode of the motoring show.

The star is standing against UKIP leader Nigel Farage in the seat of South Thanet in his guise as the Pub Landlord. Murray had hoped to jump out of a plane from 12,000ft (3,658m) after saying he was ""shocked"" at claims he had been parachuted in to fight the seat, which is held by the Conservatives. But as journalists and cameramen gathered to watch the stunt at Headcorn Aerodrome near Ashford, he learned that he was heavier than the 14st 7lb (92kg) weight limit. Murray said he was unsure how much he weighed Murray blamed the metric scales used to weigh him, and insisted the aborted jump had proved he was a ""political heavyweight"". He said: ""Unfortunately today's stunt - and that was exactly what it was, a stunt to garner publicity it might generate - has had to be cancelled due to unforeseen circumstances. ""It seems that I am too heavy to jump. It's a double whammy. ""Not only am I another tragic victim of this country's obesity epidemic, but also I have been held back by health and safety gone mad."" Murray said he was unsure how much he weighed. When asked whether Friday the 13th was the best day to perform such a stunt, he said: ""I'm a true British man - I neither cry nor weigh myself on scales. ""Those are my values."" Murray is standing for his newly-formed Free United Kingdom Party, and launched an action plan in January under the guise of his patriotic character. Later on Friday he visited the New Inn pub in the town of Sandwich, and said the aborted stunt was due to ""Brussels-based discrimination against people of my weight"". Murray took along the 10 signatories who are backing his bid for Parliament. He said: ""Why a pub for this meeting? Because the pub is the cradle of democracy in a country that is the very mother of Parliaments."" One audience member subjected him to some tough questioning, demanding to know why Murray was making a mockery of the constituency. The comedian insisted he wanted to get people to vote, adding: ""I want to put Thanet on the map - as the most important constituency in the country"". When asked about the TV debates, Murray said he would like to take part, telling reporters: ""I can stand and take this stuff, can't I?""  Mr Farage has expressed his doubts about the legitimacy of Murray's campaign. He said: ""He's not even standing as himself, he's standing as his alter ego. ""It is a bit of a laugh and I have no doubt that in terms of promotion for his tour around the UK he will make a lot of money off the back of it. ""I don't really think the joke is going to last that long."""
2015-03-15,"If you’re expecting the forthcoming Budget to make a big difference to your pockets, you may well end up a little disappointed.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150315031945/http://news.sky.com/story/1444408/the-budget-what-to-expect-from-osborne,"If you’re expecting the forthcoming Budget to make a big difference to your pockets, you may well end up a little disappointed. Pre-election Budgets tend to be short on measures and long on promises. After all, if there is a new Government elected in May, it will almost certainly table an emergency Budget to implement its own plans. Often pre-election Budgets serve as a quasi-manifesto, providing a set of fiscal measures you might be able to expect if the governing party gets re-elected. However, this time around, the Government is, of course, a coalition, and given neither party wants to pre-commit to another term of joint government, the document itself will probably be quite vague about what comes after 2015. That said, there are certainly areas where we are expecting some movement. There may well be another increase in the tax-free allowance and some anti-tax avoidance measures to clamp down on companies like Starbucks and Google, who have been accused of shifting profits around the world to cut their tax bills. If previous Budgets are anything to go by, the Chancellor may freeze or cut duty on beer prices (as compared to his predecessor but one, Gordon Brown, who preferred to ease duties on Scotch). Moreover, the Chancellor has a little more money than expected left in his accounts. Thanks to weaker inflation and lower oil prices, the budget deficit this year may be as much as £5bn smaller than expected. The question is whether Mr Osborne uses that money to pay off the national debt or to provide extra tax cuts (or, less likely, spending rises). Certainly, an instant eye-catching tax cut would be an excellent pre-election boost for the Conservatives. Finally, there’s the question of whether the Chancellor will ease up on his austerity plans after the election. At present, Mr Osborne is targeting a whopping £23.1bn surplus in 2019/20 - far bigger than is necessary even based on his fiscal targets (which just aspire to eliminate the deficit,  not to pull it into surplus). That ambition will involve swingeing spending cuts, reducing the size of the state to the lowest level since the 1930s. Those 1930s headlines were deeply unhelpful for the Tories following the Autumn Statement in December, so the Chancellor may well want to scale back the ambition of the spending cuts. Particularly since these are such long-term forecasts that no-one seriously expects them to be met with great accuracy. Finally, although expectations are low, it would be odd for the Chancellor not to attempt to pluck some kind of rabbit out of his fiscal hat. That’s what he’s tended to do in the past - can he really resist the temptation so close to an election?"
2015-03-15,Jeremy Clarkson has hinted he may be ready to leave Top Gear after being suspended over a bust-up with a producer.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150315031945/http://news.sky.com/story/1444763/clarkson-hints-at-possible-top-gear-exit,"Jeremy Clarkson has hinted he may be ready to leave Top Gear after being suspended over a bust-up with a producer. Writing in his column for the Sun newspaper he appeared to refer to himself as a ""dinosaur"", explaining that ""the day must come when you have to wave goodbye to the big monsters"".  He wrote: ""Nature made a mistake when it invented the dinosaur. It was too big, too violent ... ""All the dinosaurs died and now, years later, no-one mourns their passing. ""These big, imposing creatures have no place in a world which has moved on."" Clarkson, 54, has been suspended over a row in which he allegedly tried to hit a producer, named in reports as Oisin Tymon.  A petition calling for Clarkson to be reinstated has reached more than 840,000 signatures. But the controversial presenter wrote: ""You can start as many campaigns as you like and call on the support of politicians from all sides, but the day must come when you have to wave goodbye to the big monsters, and move on.  ""We lose one animal and get another. The world turns."" He goes on to say: ""As you may have heard, I've been suspended by the BBC following a fracas at a North Yorkshire hotel. ""I don't intend to dwell here on what happened then or what will happen in the future. I'm sure you're as fed up with the story as I am. ""One of the things which has cheered me is how many people have expressed support in the last few days. I'm touched and grateful."" Clarkson is being summoned to appear before a BBC disciplinary panel that will decide his fate. The panel will be chaired by Ken MacQuarrie, the head of BBC Scotland who conducted the investigation into Newsnight's false expose of Lord McAlpine. The corporation has not revealed when or where the hearing will take place. :: Read Sky News' interview with a family who say Clarkson launched into an expletive-ridden rant at the producer. According to reports, he lashed out because he was unable to order a steak at the Simonstone Hall Hotel near Hawes, North Yorkshire, where the production team were staying. The Sun and Daily Mirror said the hotel's chef had gone home by the time they arrived and they were only offered cold meat platters, although Clarkson had ordered a £21.95 steak. The papers quoted a source who claimed Clarkson blamed Mr Tymon for not arranging hot food and said there had been a ""scuffle""."
2015-03-15,DJ Neil Fox has been arrested over an allegation he sexually assaulted a woman in the early 1990s.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150315031945/http://news.sky.com/story/1444595/dj-neil-fox-arrested-over-sex-assault-claim,"DJ Neil Fox has been arrested over an allegation he sexually assaulted a woman in the early 1990s. The arrest came as the Magic presenter, also known as Dr Fox, voluntarily attended a central London police station to answer bail. It is the third time Fox has been arrested by Metropolitan Police officers investigating claims of sexual assault. In December, the 53-year-old radio broadcaster was questioned over four separate sex assault allegations. Two of the allegations are said to have happened in the 1990s. The third is said to have occurred in 2007. Fox was first held on September 30 last year. He has been further bailed to return on a date in late March, pending further inquiries."
2015-03-15,It begins with a provocatively named documentary and ends with a Twitter spat involving Britain's best-known political leaders.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150315031945/http://news.sky.com/story/1443744/race-ukips-black-and-white-issue,"It begins with a provocatively named documentary and ends with a Twitter spat involving Britain's best-known political leaders. Nigel Farage's comments in Things We Won't Say About Race That Are True were clearly designed to stir up controversy. In a nutshell his argument was this: that UKIP is colour blind; racism virtually dead (just ask his children); and so, anti-discrimination laws are no longer necessary. Mr Farage says he is trying to protect all those British born from a new and different threat - the arrival of eastern Europeans searching for work. Enter David Cameron and Ed Miliband, with their angry tweets. Gallery: Farage Race Row Twitter Spat The Prime Minister accused Mr Farage of ""attention seeking"" And straight back at them from Mr Farage, who said to the Prime Minister the argument that today's law ""doesn't protect British workers, black or white"". And he added, to the opposition leader, that ""the laws don't represent these values, Ed. The British people do"". This all goes to the heart of UKIP's strategy on immigration and race. The party has worked hard to dispel any suggestion of racist tendencies by focusing instead on the latest arrivals to Britain - a group who you may have noticed are white. This row allows them to go a step further, by claiming their attacks on eastern European immigration are all about defending non-white Britons. In fact, Mr Farage has now claimed that mass immigration is fuelling high unemployment rates among black people in this country. And he is also giving a significant proportion of the population rhetoric that he knows they will lap up. We can see from the hundreds of thousands of people signing up in support of Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson that some people, at least, are itching to see high profile figures taking on political correctness. Unsurprisingly, Mr Farage has caused fury among those who say racism is still alive and kicking in Britain. They point to the offensive chants of Chelsea players on the Paris metro and evidence of discrimination in the work place. Take the shadow cabinet member Sadiq Khan, who welcomes the changes triggered by anti-discrimination laws but says Mr Farage is showing ""breath-taking ignorance"" if he thinks Britain has reached ""utopia"". And it is true that Office For National Statistics figures show a disparity in the unemployment rate - from 5.6% overall to 10.3% for those of Bangladeshi ethnicity; 14.3% for those of Pakistani heritage; and 15.5% for Black Africans and Caribbeans. Of course, we can't prove that employment discrimination is driving those figures but clearly something is going on in society that says a white person remains significantly more likely to find work than their brown or black counterpart. Other critics go further. They say that by claiming there is nothing racist about attacking Poles, Bulgarians or Romanians, he is simply opening the door to a new, form of discrimination that is just as dark as what preceded it."

2015-03-15,"Actress Sadie Frost has told a court that phone hacking carried out by Mirror Group newspapers had ""completely destroyed"" her life.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150315031945/http://news.sky.com/story/1444620/sadie-frost-mirror-hacking-destroyed-my-life,"By By Hind Hassan, Sky News Reporter Actress Sadie Frost has told a court that phone hacking carried out by Mirror Group newspapers had ""completely destroyed"" her life. The actress spoke at a hearing to determine compensation for victims of phone hacking by MGN's three titles; The Daily Mirror, The Sunday Mirror and The People. She told the court: ""It's completely destroyed my life ... I deserve damages for what you (MGN) did to me, which was illegal."" Frost described various relationships that were affected by stories which appeared in the press  - which she later understood to be a product of phone hacking. Her mother and sister were among five family members she asked to sign a confidentiality agreement. Messages the 49-year-old left on the answer machine of her friend Kate Moss were also hacked. According to Frost - it was at a time the two had been in ""constant communication"", at one point nearly every other hour. The actress recalled a ""row"" she had with the model which then appeared ""embellished"" and ""exaggerated"" in a newspaper article. She also described how she was left feeling embarrassed after photographs appeared of a lunch date with her former boyfriend, Jackson Scott. She said that Mr Scott and his mother suspected that Frost had leaked their location. At one point the actress became agitated by the line of questioning at the hearing. She told Matthew Nicklin QC, representing MGN: ""You're trying to undermine me, I'm very confused and stressed; you're making me feel like I'm guilty of something."" Later in the hearing the judge asked for Frost to leave the courtroom so that he could consult with Mr Nicklin. Whilst she remained outside the room Mr Nicklin was advised to consider his style, tone and content of his questioning. Mr Nicklin reiterated the apology issued by Trinity Mirror - which owns MGN. As well as Frost, MGN has also admitted hacking the phones of BBC creative director Alan Yentob, soap stars Shane Richie, Shobna Gulati and Lucy Taggart, footballer Paul Gascoigne, TV producer Robert Ashworth and flight attendant Lauren Alcorn."
