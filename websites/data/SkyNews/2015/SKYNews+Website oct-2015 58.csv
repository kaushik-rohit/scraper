2015-10-06,"England has become the last nation in the UK to introduce charges for plastic bags, in a bid to protect wildlife and reduce littering on the streets.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151006031907/http://news.sky.com/story/1563854/confusion-over-complicated-plastic-bag-law,"England has become the last nation in the UK to introduce charges for plastic bags, in a bid to protect wildlife and reduce littering on the streets. From today, shoppers at all big stores will need to pay 5p for every bag provided at the tills - and it's hoped most consumers will remember to bring their own. Last year, more than 7.6 billion plastic bags were handed out by major supermarkets alone - the equivalent of 140 per person. Critics have claimed the charges are too complicated, and could lead to confusion and longer queues at the tills. The Government has also faced criticism from environmental campaigners, who say it is wrong that smaller shops have been exempted from the policy. :: Find out how the new bag changes affect you Only retailers that employ more than 250 full-time workers will need to begin charging their customers, and paper bags can continue to be handed out for free. In Wales, where a more comprehensive bag-charging policy has been enforced, the number of single-use carrier bags handed out by stores fell by 79% in three years. Westminster hopes England's plastic bag charge will see use fall by as much as 80% in supermarkets, and 50% elsewhere on the high street. It is also estimated that the fee will slash litter clean-up costs by £60m, while simultaneously generating £730m for good causes. Most shoppers appear to be behind the policy, with one poll suggesting that 62% of shoppers in England believe the 5p charge is reasonable. The Break The Bag Habit group, who conducted the survey, also discovered that 51% of consumers would support a scheme which applied to all retailers irrespective of their size. Nine in 10 Welsh retailers have said the plastic bag charge hasn't impacted their trade. England's Environment Minister, Rory Stewart, said: ""We're all guilty of taking a carrier bag from a supermarket, storing it somewhere safe at home with the intention of using it again, then forgetting to take it with us next time we go to the shops. ""Simple changes to our shopping routines, such as taking our own bags with us or using more bags for life, can make a huge difference in reducing the amount of plastic in circulation – meaning we can all enjoy a cleaner, healthier country."""
2015-10-06,Fashion company American Apparel has filed for bankruptcy after suffering from plunging sales and a battle to oust its controversial founder.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151006031907/http://news.sky.com/story/1564035/american-apparel-files-for-bankruptcy,"Fashion company American Apparel has filed for bankruptcy after suffering from plunging sales and a battle to oust its controversial founder. The one-time favourite with teens and hipsters said it had reached a deal with 95% of its lenders to reduce its debts and will file for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The deal, which includes extra financing, would enable the company to keep running its Los Angeles-based manufacturing operation and 130 US stores. No job cuts were mentioned in the filing, which is not expected to affect American Apparel's worldwide stores, which include 20 outlets in the UK and Ireland. The firm's founder Dov Charney faced a string of allegations Lenders have agreed to write off around $200m (£131m) in bonds in exchange for shares - cutting the firm's debt to around $135m (£89m) and reducing annual interest payments by some $20m (£13m).  American Apparel was started by Dov Charney in his college dorm room and eventually expanded to a network of 260 shops in 19 countries. The brand attracted praise for its ""Made In America"" policy and notoriety for highly-sexualised ad campaigns in equal measure as it became a leader in edgy fashion for noughties club kids. But the company's image took a knock as a string of lurid allegations began to emerge against Mr Charney, leaving lawyers handling several sexual harassment cases. American Apparel's board ousted Mr Charney as chairman in June 2014 and fired him from his chief executive role for sexual misconduct six months later. The company appeared to be heading for bankruptcy after announcing a 10th consecutive quarterly loss - of $19.4m (£12.7m) - in the second quarter of 2015, amid a 17% drop in sales."

The Stagecoach bus is said to have hit a number of stationary cars and a lamppost before crashing into a Sainsbury's supermarket in Trinity Street at around 6pm on Saturday. Ambulance officials said six people, including a child, were taken to hospital. Two people were treated at the scene. A police spokesman said: ""An eight-year-old boy from Leamington, who was travelling on the top of the bus, died at the scene as a result of his injuries. ""A woman from Nuneaton, believed to be in her 70s who was a pedestrian in Trinity Street, also died at the scene."" The girl, who was on the upper deck of the bus, is in a critical but stable condition in hospital.  Two other casualties also remain in hospital. Grandmother Hazel Boardhurst, who was in the supermarket when the bus crashed in, told Sky News: ""I was in there at three minutes to six buying some chewing gum and it was just boom. ""I really didn't know what it was - I thought it might be a bomb or an IS attack - you just don't know these days. ""To find out seconds later it was a bus was unbelievable - those poor children who were injured your heart goes out to them."" Maneer Fiaz told Sky News he was shopping nearby when he heard a ""loud bang"" and saw people running to the scene. ""I came outside the shop and saw the bus was smashed into the cashpoint. I ran towards the driver and he was surprisingly alive,"" he said.

Harry Clarke, 58, is accused of unlawfully getting behind the wheel of a car on 20 September, it is understood. A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: ""A 58-year-old man was arrested in connection with alleged road traffic offences. ""A report will be sent to the procurator fiscal."" A fatal accident inquiry into the bin lorry crash on 22 December last year heard Mr Clarke lost consciousness at the wheel of the council vehicle. It then travelled out of control along Queen Street and towards George Square before crashing in to the side of the Millennium Hotel. Erin McQuade, 18, and her grandparents Jack Sweeney, 68, and Lorraine Sweeney, 69, from Dumbarton, West Dunbartonshire, died from multiple injuries after being hit by the truck. Stephenie Tait, 29, and Jacqueline Morton, 51, both from Glasgow, and Gillian Ewing, 52, from Edinburgh, were also killed. Fifteen other people were injured."

George Osborne's speech is no different. Tax credits may not be spoken about on the conference floor, but in private MPs can't stop talking about them. The argument is logical. What's the point in taxing people on low incomes in order to regurgitate the money back to them through the welfare system? Conservative ministers make a compelling case that the low paid are better off overall when you take into account a higher minimum wage, increased childcare funding and lower fuel duty. And yet, and yet. MPs in marginal seats are getting twitchy. ""They just don't get it,"" one told me about his colleagues in safe Tory seats. ""This is going to be a major issue for my constituents. It's going to hurt them."" Another MP in a battleground constituency said: ""You can't take candy from a baby. We weren't open to people before the election about where the welfare cuts would come from. It's going to come as a shock to those affected."" The Sun - not known for being a bleeding-heart leftie newspaper to say the least - is campaigning against the tax credit cut (many of the paper's readers are likely to be impacted.) Gallery: George Osborne's Highs And Lows Gideon Oliver Osborne was born in 1971 to Sir Peter Osborne and Felicity Alexandra Loxton-Peacock (pictured). He changed his name aged 13 to George because it was more straightforward Mr Osborne is an incredibly political Chancellor with an eye on succeeding David Cameron as Conservative Party leader. He may not overtly talk about tax credits in his conference speech, but make no mistake, it will be occupying his mind."

Members of the public will get a 5% discount on the market price and receive a bonus share for every 10 if they hold on to their investment for more than a year. Applications can be made online and by post, with all proceeds from the share sale being used to pay down the national debt. In a bid to avoid wealthier investors snapping up the shares, anyone applying for less than £1,000 will be prioritised. The sale, planned for next spring, is the latest phase of the Government's drive to exit from its shareholding in the group in the coming months. The Chancellor told Sky News: ""We've got a big task here, which is to finally get the British Government out of owning great chunks of our banking system. ""We've made a lot of progress with Lloyd's, but this final chunk, this final sale, will be the biggest privatisation in over 20 years, and I don't want all of those shares to go to City institutions. ""I want them to go to members of the public."" More than £20bn in taxpayers' money was pumped into Lloyds in a bid to prop up the bank at the height of the global financial crisis. The Government has been gradually selling off shares to institutional investors, but next year's sale will be the first chance for the general public to get involved."
2015-10-06,"The Prime Minister has said he is prepared to press the red button if he has to, as he looked to exploit Labour's division on the nation's security.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151006031907/http://news.sky.com/story/1563658/pm-i-am-prepared-to-press-red-button,"The Prime Minister has said he is prepared to press the red button if he has to, as he looked to exploit Labour's division on the nation's security. On the first day of the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester, David Cameron said he believed the country should retain the Trident nuclear deterrent. And he said that Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's recent comment that he would not authorise the use of nuclear weapons even if Britain was under nuclear attack ""undermined national security"". Mr Cameron said: ""The problem with his answer is, if you ... believe like me that Britain should keep the ultimate insurance policy of an independent nuclear deterrent, you have to accept there are circumstances in which its use would be justified. ""If you give any other answer then you are, frankly, undermining our national security, undermining our deterrent, "" he told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show.  Mr Corbyn's remarks in an interview marred the last day of the Labour Party Conference. The party is significantly divided on the issue with a number of prominent Shadow Cabinet members seeking to retain the Trident system - which is up for renewal next year - and Mr Corbyn suggesting he was happy to accept a split on the issue. Security is one of the three key themes of the Conservative conference - the others are stability and opportunity - and Mr Cameron will be seeking to capitalise on Labour's division on the country's defence capabilities. Mr Cameron also confirmed there would be a vote on British military action in Syria - despite Russia's recent intervention. In a separate newspaper interview, he disclosed he would ""beef up"" the SAS and the number of drones Britain has to tackle Islamic State. Mr Cameron told The Sunday Telegraph, the Ministry of Defence would buy a fleet of 20 Protector drones from the US. On Saturday, Mr Cameron said Russian strikes in Syria were hitting citizens and helping the ""butcher Bashar al Assad"". He said that few of the strikes were hitting IS targets. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon has said only one in 20 attacks have hit the terrorists. The Prime Minister urged Russia's president Vladimir Putin to work with Europe and the US to fight IS and not to prop up the Assad regime. Mr Fallon and Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond both spoke at the conference on Sunday. :: On tax credit cuts: Three million families to lose £1,500 in tax credits just before Christmas Mr Cameron ruled out any watering down of the tax credit cuts, which will see three million people lose £1,500 a year just before Christmas. Asked if he would consider a review of the changes announced by Mr Osborne in the Budget, the Prime Minister replied firmly: “No. We think the changes we have put forward are right and they come with higher pay and lower taxes.” The Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned that it was ""arithmetically impossible"" for no one to be left out of pocket but Mr Cameron claimed their calculations were not right. There had been some suggestion the Chancellor could announce a partial reversal of the cuts after increasing pressure and campaigning and claims they could be an ""unexploded bomb"" for his party leadership hopes. :: On the EU: The Prime Minister suggested he would be prepared to lead a Brexit campaign if he did not secure the EU reforms he is demanding from European leaders. He said: ""If I can't get the things that Britain needs then I don't rule anything out in the role that I would play. PM does not rule out leading Brexit campaign Mr Cameron accepted that he could never satisfy the party eurosceptics no matter what deal was secured. :: Lurch to the Right: The Prime Minister said the Conservatives would remain firmly in the ""common ground"" and said that the party would not engage in any ""back-slapping"" this week on the fortunes of Labour. He said: ""As others are losing their heads and lurching off, we will be absolutely in the common ground, delivering for the working people of Britain."" There will only be ""mild celebration"" at the conference :: On the NHS: Mr Cameron announced a new GPs' contract that would free family doctors from box-ticking and put the focus on providing a seven-day NHS. Speaking about junior doctors, he said: ""We are going to have to make some difficult decisions"" but said that patients want to have a service where they can see doctors when they needed. He said: ""A seven-day NHS is not just about GPs. It's also about our hospitals. The fact is there are around 11,000 excess deaths because we don't work properly at the weekend. PM announces new GP contract :: On the leadership contest: The Prime Minister confirmed he would only serve two terms and said he thought ""10 years is enough"" but he said he was ""passsionate"" about having the top job and said: ""I leap out of bed every morning."" He denied suggestions that the way was being paved for Mr Osborne to take over and said: ""It’s not a coronation because it's not my decision."" It has been suggested Mr Cameron will go in Spring 2019 to allow the new leader time to bed in before the 2020 General Election. PM: no coronation He said: ""Now the effect it has on the Conservative Party - frankly, I would say it's good we have a team, a team with stars in it and of course we will look at some of those stars and whether he or she would be able to do this job. ""Good. Frankly, great. People are asking 'look at this person, look at that person' - I want to run a team and that's great."" The Sunday Times today suggested there were as many as 18 ministers and former ministers prepared to take on the Chancellor, who in a separate interview said he would “see how it flies” when Mr Cameron steps down. :: On that book Speaking about the unauthorised biography, which contained some seamy allegations, Mr Cameron said the purpose of the book, as a form of revenge, was clear. He said: ""It think everyone can see why this book was written. I think everyone can see through it."" The book, Call Me Dave, is on sale on one of the party conference stands. On sale at the Manchester conference"
2015-10-06,"George ""The Builder"" is hoping to build on the Conservative vote in the North.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151006031907/http://news.sky.com/story/1564362/will-the-devolution-revolution-bring-prosperity,"George ""The Builder"" is hoping to build on the Conservative vote in the North. For that reason he needs the powerhouse to make potential swing voters more prosperous, at least in regions that might potentially vote in a Conservative MP. Take Stockton. In its southern constituency, the Conservatives won more easily than expected in the last general election. The tight marginal increased its Tory majority from a few hundred to over five thousand votes. The local MP, James Wharton, was duly appointed Northern Powerhouse minister and last Friday he opened a hi-tech centre in his constituency called Fusion. Some of the firms opening offices in the building are hopeful the decision to devolve business rates to local authorities will offer a further boost to the region. Ross Coulman, managing director of IAMTech, told Sky News: ""I think the Northwest seems to get a bit more of the limelight than the Northeast. ""That's helped by the media presence in Manchester. ""If you look at the high-speed rail links they seem to be biased towards Leeds and the Northwest and the Northeast is the poor relation in the northern powerhouse. ""Perhaps that will change if the local government is empowered through business rates - maybe we can attract more businesses to come here. More niche businesses that can help fill the gap we are suffering now from the loss of the different heavy industries."" Of course only 13 miles away the closure of Redcar's steel factory is one of those losses and here George Osborne's policy might not be so welcome. It was no coincidence that shadow chancellor John McDonnell was in the seaside town to talk to some of the 1,700 steel workers who have lost their jobs. Despite it being a Labour policy to devolve business rates, Mr McDonnell identifies problems with Mr Osborne's plan. He says the decision to only allow most councils to reduce business rates, and only increase them if they have a mayor, could lead to ""a race to the bottom"". Mr McDonnell added: ""One council will compete against another to cut their business rates to attract businesses and that could be quite dangerous to the stability of long term funding for local government. ""Secondly, we are anxious about the equalisation scheme because some local authorities haven't got the opportunity in having strong business rates to support their services. ""On that basis I'm worried that the poorer communities could be hit hard. So we've got to look carefully at the protections in place."" The Government says there will be a safety net for councils who see their revenues fall by 7.5% a year or more. That would certainly apply to a situation like Redcar. However, when local authorities last had this devolved power, back in the 1980s, Professor Steve Fothergill led a government-funded study into the impact of business rates on the location of jobs. He concluded that there was no evidence that high business rates destroyed jobs or that low business rates stimulated employment. So it could be that the devolution revolution has no impact at all."

The forecaster said the tail-end of the hurricane, which has already caused havoc in the United States, Barbados, Bahamas and Bermuda, could arrive at the weekend. But its possible arrival is not expected to bring the 100mph-strong winds that are currently battering Bermuda. Dean Hall, from the Met Office, said: ""There's a lot of uncertainty surrounding this weekend with the possibility of Hurricane Joaquin coming in. ""There's the potential of it being quite wet and windy throughout."" Hurricane Joaquin threatening the US on Friday Mr Hall went on to say that there would also be a marked contrast to the recent warm weather at the start of this week. ""All changes this week with low pressure weather, showers, thunder and breezy in parts. Certainly a contrast to what we have been used to in the last few weeks,"" he said. ""Showers will continue Monday spreading north but feeling warm in any sunshine despite the wind."" He added: ""The wet weather will clear on Wednesday leaving some fine, dry conditions for Thursday and there is the risk of mist, fog and perhaps a bit of frost."" Nearing the Bahamas last week After roaring across parts of the Bahamas as a category 4 hurricane, Joaquin has lost steam as it travels across the Atlantic and winds have dropped to 105mph, making it a category 2 storm. However, it was still expected to bring hurricane conditions and a ""life-threatening"" storm surge to Bermuda as it hit on Sunday night. Sky's weather producer Joanna Robinson said: ""Joaquin's forecast track takes it north-eastwards across the Atlantic, where it will eventually be picked up by the Jet Stream. ""It will then head towards Europe as an area of low pressure, but exactly where it will reach is still uncertain. ""It does look like the UK will see a ridge of high pressure later in the week, therefore stalling the remnants of Joaquin over the Atlantic. ""Where it will go over the weekend is still very uncertain and depends on the exact position of the area of high pressure. ""It may move to the north of the UK or perhaps to the south, but either way it won’t be anything like the storm seen over the Bahamas and Bermuda."""
2015-10-06,Liverpool's American owners are about to appoint their third manager in five uneven years in possession of the deeds to Anfield.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151006031907/http://news.sky.com/story/1564364/liverpool-owners-crave-success-in-rigid-system,"Liverpool's American owners are about to appoint their third manager in five uneven years in possession of the deeds to Anfield. Jurgen Klopp is the overwhelming favourite with bookmakers and fans to succeed Brendan Rodgers, and the German has many assets. He has a track-record of success, youth on his side, and enough charisma to win over some of the most demanding and discerning supporters in the country. If Rodgers was a technocrat in the modern mould, speaking a fluent blend of manager and management speak, Klopp is a coach thriving with old-fashioned traits. He has a blazing, off-beat personality that found a perfect match at Borussia Dortmund, Germany's second-club, which he made both successful and, in part perhaps to a beard any hipster would give his flat white for, fashionable. Liverpool, with fans similarly intense and industrial in outlook, looks a great fit, but will test just how transferrable his skills are. What will not change for Klopp or anyone else, is the nature of the challenge. Jurgen Klopp is favourite to succeed Brendan Rogers Managing Liverpool is not just about restoring glory to a once-dominant club whose craving for success has ballooned during 25 years spent in the shadow of Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea. You have to do it while squaring a circle for the self-made, self-appointed coalition of financial traders and entertainment moguls who make up FSG. They crave not just success, but success delivered within a rigid system. Their philosophy, denoted by the shorthand 'Moneyball', was fashioned in baseball, home of their other prime sporting asset, the Boston Red Sox. It applies metrics to the organised chaos of team sport, borrowing techniques from the financial markets to analyse data, spot value in layers that others have missed, and pay for them accordingly. It has worked in baseball. In football, a game that resolutely refuses to buck the trend that he who spends most wins, not so much. At Liverpool its manifestation is the notorious ""transfer committee"", a group that tries to balance the short-term demands of a manager thinking about next weekend (and his job security), with the long term interests of the club and the balance sheet. You cannot blame the owners for trying. If you were spending hundreds of millions of pounds you might want to apply some logic to how it was spent, to make every transfer not only a bargain but a success. Liverpool owner John W Henry (R) and wife Linda Pizzuti The more so if you spent £35m in your first season on Andy Carroll, and have since worked through almost 10 times as much on players some of whom would have been fortunate to walk past Anfield, let alone wear the red shirt. They want predictable performance, quantifiable brilliance, accountable excellence. But imposing order on a ruthless market and an anarchic game is a huge challenge. And FSG should know. Liverpool came close to winning the league two seasons ago with a team featuring Luis Suarez, Raheem Sterling, Daniel Sturridge and Steven Gerrard. The first two have been sold for a combined £140m, Sturridge has been injured almost ever since, and Gerrard has moved on. And in case anyone can forget, the title was lost the moment the Liverpool captain slipped and gifted Chelsea a goal. Not even Jurgen Klopp can account for that in a spreadsheet."
2015-10-06,Britain's most senior counter-terror police officer has warned that social media firms are putting lives at risk by refusing to co-operate with investigations into terrorist activity.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151006031907/http://news.sky.com/story/1564269/social-media-firms-undermine-police-on-terror,"Britain's most senior counter-terror police officer has warned that social media firms are putting lives at risk by refusing to co-operate with investigations into terrorist activity. Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said some companies were designing products in such a way that they are useless to police conducting covert surveillance operations. Companies are adopting a strategy of refusing to provide detectives with online data of terrorist suspects and some inform suspects they are under police surveillance, he claimed. Met Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley In a speech at the Royal United Services Institute, Mr Rowley said advances in technology were creating surveillance ""blind spots"" making it harder to arrest suspects. ""We've had terrorist cases in that last year where digital surveillance gaps have meant that as the plot has developed we've been unsighted on exact details of what they're planning,"" he said. ""Criminals and terrorists are better educated and informed as to where our blind spots are and they are therefore better able to operate safely. ""Some social media companies refuse to assist and for some this is part of their strategy. ""They design their products in full recognition they'll be unable to help us. ""Some simply undermine us by adopting a policy that if they supply data to us they'll tell the subject they've done that. ""That's not desperately helpful to covert operations."" Mr Rowley warned that the use of encryption by cybercriminals is increasingly posing a challenge for police investigations. ""We've had occasions where we've had to prolong dangerous operations and delay arrests until we can confidently obtain evidence because encryption has been slowing our progress,"" he said. ""That delay makes us all very nervous. ""If we jump too early without enough evidence we have people in custody for few days and they're back on the streets better informed of what we know about them. ""If we run it too late and the consequences are potentially awful.""

There could be some confusion for customers, too – as not all stores are obliged to begin charging for the carrier bags they provide. :: Does it apply everywhere? Only larger retailers need to start charging 5p per bag from today, and the Government has defined this as companies which employ more than 250 full-time employees. That means major supermarkets and most high street chains are affected by the policy, yet independent shops and convenience stores can continue providing bags for free. You may have to begin requesting plastic carrier bags from shop attendants, as some retailers are taking an ""out of sight, out of mind"" approach. Plastic bags offered in airport and train station shops are also exempt. :: What about paper bags? Some campaigners are angry because paper bags – which also cause a headache from a littering perspective – are not included in the Government's policy. A handful of retailers currently offer paper bags as standard, yet it remains to be seen whether others will abandon plastic bags altogether to simplify things for shoppers. :: Will plastic bags for loose goods be charged? Plastic bags for loose fruit and vegetables are exempt from this new charge in England. The same is true for uncooked meat and fish, prescription medication, takeaway food, unwrapped blades, and even live aquatic animals in water. :: How is England's law different from the one in Wales? Wales has had a four-year head start on England – and by the looks of things, it does get easier with time. Their law specifically applies to ""single-use carrier bags"", irrespective of whether they are made of plastic or paper. :: How will my 5p be spent? Retailers do not have to pass the proceeds on to the Government, as it is not actually a tax. However, it is expected the money generated will go to good causes – and it's estimated up to £730m could be raised all in all."
2015-10-06,A former Dragons' Den star who acted as an adviser to David Cameron has appeared in court on child sex charges.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151006031907/http://news.sky.com/story/1564202/ex-tv-dragon-doug-richard-in-child-sex-case,"A former Dragons' Den star who acted as an adviser to David Cameron has appeared in court on child sex charges. Doug Richard is accused of three counts of sexual activity with a child and one of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity. The charges relate to a single complainant, a girl who was 13 when the offences allegedly took place in January. Richard, 57, spoke only to confirm his name, date of birth and address during the short hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court. He was released on unconditional bail to appear at the Old Bailey on 19 October. Richard, of Islington, north London, was described in court by both the prosecution and defence as being a man of good character. He denied the allegations in a short statement issued after the charges were confirmed last month. The US-born technology millionaire said at the time: ""I absolutely deny the charges against me and will contest this matter in court."" The tycoon appeared in the first two series of Dragons' Den and reportedly travelled with the Prime Minister on an official government trip to Africa and advised on policy. His association with Mr Cameron goes back to 2008, when the then opposition leader invited him to write a report about small businesses in Britain. Richard founded a business loans initiative called School For Startups, alongside the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills."

2015-10-06,"As figures show consumers in the UK are spending more on painkillers than ever before, a Sky News investigation reveals branded pills that claim to target pain can cost up to four times more than unbranded tablets.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151006031907/http://news.sky.com/story/1563842/sky-investigation-branded-painkillers-do-same-job,"By Poppy Trowbridge, Consumer Affairs Correspondent As figures show consumers in the UK are spending more on painkillers than ever before, a Sky News investigation reveals branded pills that claim to target pain can cost up to four times more than unbranded tablets. For example, packets of 16 tablets of ibuprofen, some claiming to target period pain or migraines, can cost up to £3.99. The comparable generic version costs just £1.35. Some store-brand paracetamol tablets are less than 1p per pill, whereas well-known name-brands can cost 20p each. The painkillers industry was worth nearly £357m last year - an increase of 3.4% in just a year, figures show.  Jayne Lawrence, professor of biophysical pharmaceutics at Kings College London, said: ""Some people believe that by taking a more expensive preparation, perhaps a branded formulation, they'll get better pain relief. ""If it's the same dose of drug, in the same formulation, the customer will experience no difference."" Packets of painkillers are each printed with a Product Licence Code, which identifies the ingredients and proves the medicine has been permitted for sale. Boxes with the same Product Licence Codes contain identical ingredients, yet some are marketed and sold for specific problems like tension headache, for women with period pain or especially for joint pain. According to Prof Lawrence, pain relief medications taken in pill form cannot target specific areas of the body, but only act on general pain in the body. She added that it can be confusing and potentially dangerous for patients who may believe if they have two different aches, that two types of pain relief are required and they could end up taking more than the recommended dose. Claims to target pain may be misleading for consumers, but Dr Ellie Cannon says the patient experience may be different with more expensive names. ""What's going to be different is the taste of the medicine, how easy it is to swallow,"" she said. John Smith, the consumer healthcare spokesman and chief executive of the Proprietary Association of Great Britain which represents branded pain medicines like Nurofen and Feminax, said: ""The brands are always more expensive, but if you look at what we do, we continue to invest in brands to bring new products to the marketplace. ""That gives people the choice. It's then up to the individual when you go to the store to choose a product that you believe is safe and effective."""

Gallery: Murder Investigation After Police Officer Run Over In Merseyside A forensic officer photographs the scene at Wallasey Dock Road where PC David Phillips was struck and killed by a stolen car His death is being treated as murder and Prime Minister David Cameron said the perpetrator must be caught to ""ensure justice is done"". He added: ""It is a reminder that every day people in our police force, they get up, they put on their uniform and they take extraordinary risks on our behalf. There’s no such thing as a safe day if you're a police officer."" The vehicle, which was stolen during a burglary at an estate agents in Birkenhead early in the morning, was later found abandoned in Wallasey. Police said all the evidence they have at this point is the vehicle. ""He didn't stand a chance,"" said chief constable Sir Jon Murphy, who urged the driver and the other occupant of the Mitsubishi to do the ""sensible thing"" and give themselves up. ""If you don't - we will find you,"" he warned. Sir Jon said PC Phillips joined Merseyside Police in 2006 and was ""popular and held in high regard"" by his colleagues.  He said everyone's thoughts were with his wife and children and his mother and father, adding: ""This is an incredibly sad day for Merseyside Police."" Sir Jon said PC Phillips is the first Merseyside Police officer to be killed on duty as a result of a criminal act since 1981. Merseyside Police and Crime Commissioner Jane Kennedy's voice broke with emotion when she spoke to journalists at the force HQ in Liverpool. She said: ""Today is a day of mourning for the entire police family. ""Police officers are on the front line every single day protecting our communities.

2015-10-09,Scientists in the US claim they may have discovered how to predict a person's sexual orientation.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151009145420/http://news.sky.com/story/1566381/straight-or-gay-sexuality-linked-to-dna-claim,"Scientists in the US claim they may have discovered how to predict a person's sexual orientation. They found nine parts of a person’s genetic code which may play a role in determining whether someone is straight or gay. The scientists uncovered the link after comparing the DNA of 47 pairs of male twins, including brothers with different sexual orientation. By studying molecular data from the nine genome sites, the team claim they were able to guess whether a twin pair was heterosexual or homosexual with 70% accuracy. Lead researcher Dr Tuck Ngun, from the University of California at Los Angeles, said: ""To our knowledge, this is the first example of a predictive model for sexual orientation based on molecular markers."" He added: ""Sexual attraction is such a fundamental part of life, but it's not something we know a lot about at the genetic and molecular level. ""I hope that this research helps us understand ourselves better and why we are the way we are."" The research is also said to provide evidence of environmental influences affecting sexual orientation by altering the activity of certain genes. These so-called ""epigenetic"" effects involve a molecular modification to DNA called methylation. The study was presented at the American Society of Human Genetics' annual meeting in Baltimore, where many UK scientists were sceptical and said more work was needed to confirm the findings. Professor Tim Spector, from King's College London, a leading expert on twin studies and genetics, said: ""It has always been a mystery why identical twins who share all their genes can vary in homosexuality. ""Epigenetic differences are one obvious reason and this study provides evidence for this. ""However the small study needs replicating before any talk of prediction is realistic."" Darren Griffin, professor of genetics at the University of Kent, said: ""To claim a 70% predictive value of something as complex as homosexuality is bold indeed. ""I wait with bated breath for a full peer-reviewed article. ""While there is strong evidence in general for a biological basis for homosexuality my personal impression has always been one of a multiple contributory factors, including life experiences."""
2015-10-09,"A record export of cars worth £2.4bn in August has helped boost UK trade figures, according to official statistics.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151009145420/http://news.sky.com/story/1566557/record-car-exports-boost-uk-trade-figures,"A record export of cars worth £2.4bn in August has helped boost UK trade figures, according to official statistics. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said total export of goods increased by £800m in the month to £23.6bn, helping to narrow the country's trade deficit - the difference between the goods and services imported versus those exported - to £3.3bn. It represented a narrowing of 1.2bn on the previous month. Car exports contributed £600m more to the export performance while sales of chemicals overseas added £500m. The ONS said imports of goods decreased by £300m to £34.7bn over the month. Boosting overseas trade is a crucial plank of the Government's plans to rebalance the UK economy away from being so reliant on consumer spending. However, the slowdown in developing economies and continuing weakness in the euro area - the country's largest trading partner - are hampering demand while the strong pound has made UK goods less attractive. UK car production has enjoyed a recovery - currently back at pre-recession levels in terms of annual performance - but it remains to be seen whether worries about the global recovery will hamper demand. The emissions scandal currently engulfing VW could provide a short term demand boost for UK manufacturers despite the fallout from VW's 'defeat device' raising questions about exhaust emissions across the industry as a whole."

Spencer Stone, 23, was in intensive care after undergoing surgery for an apparent punctured lung following a brawl outside the nightclub in Sacramento, California. He was with four friends when they got into an altercation with another group of people, according to Sacramento Deputy Police Chief Ken Bernard. Cab driver Kennedy Hailermariam witnessed the Airman First Class fighting off three men. He told KCRA: ""When I got the green light, I was (able) to go. The fight was over. It was real quick. Mr Stone was injured while subduing an armed gunman on a French train ""(Stone) knocked out one guy, after he got stabbed like three or four times."" Mr Hailermariam told the TV station it was three men against one and added that a 24-year-old woman was also injured after she tried to protect Mr Stone after he had been stabbed. ""She got a big hit. She got one big punch,"" he added. Mr Stone was admitted to the UC Davis Medical Center on Thursday with three stab wounds to his torso and is expected to make a full recovery. Initial reports had claimed Mr Stone would not survive his injuries. CCTV footage has emerged of the fight between him and the group of men. The fight is not believed to be connected to terrorism. Mr Bernard said officers were searching for two Asian men in their 20s who fled the scene in a dark Toyota Camry. In a news conference he said: ""The assault does not appear to be a random act. It is believed to be related to a nightclub incident. ""This incident is a very unfortunate altercation between two groups of folks enjoying the nightlife in Midtown. It is not related to terrorism in any way."" Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson tweeted his support for Mr Stone. He wrote: ""My thoughts and prayers go out to Spencer Stone and the Stone family. I ask that everyone respect the family's privacy at this time."" In August, Mr Stone and his friends Alek Skarlatos and Anthony Sadler were hailed as heroes after subduing heavily armed gunman Ayoub El Khazzani on a train heading from Amsterdam to Paris. Mr Stone suffered a badly cut thumb and a wound to his neck after he was attacked with a box cutter during the struggle. President Barack Obama met the three Americans last month and they were all awarded France's highest honour. Mr Skarlatos, an Army National Guard Specialist, described Mr Stone as ""one tough guy"" after learning of the stabbing. He tweeted: ""Everybody send prayers out to the Stone family today."""
2015-10-09,"During the time of the Norman Kings between 1066 and 1154, the Privy Council was made up of those appointed by the King and the Queen.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151009145420/http://news.sky.com/story/1565991/what-is-the-role-of-the-privy-council,"During the time of the Norman Kings between 1066 and 1154, the Privy Council was made up of those appointed by the King and the Queen. They met in private to discuss matters of governance. It was the chief governing body of the day, and included noblemen, the clergy and officers of the Crown - similar to the modern-day Cabinet. Today, the Cabinet is a committee of the Privy Council, which consists of 500 privy counsellors. These include the current and all former prime ministers, past and current Cabinet ministers, leaders of the opposition and archbishops. The council meets around once a month with the Queen - the last meeting was on 15 July at Buckingham Palace. The Government says the council is very open, with the details of all its meetings and attendees made available to the public through the Court Circular, which is the official record of engagements carried out by the monarch. In recent times, the power of the monarch within the Privy Council meeting has been largely ceremonial.  At the meeting, the Queen ""approves"" any new order that has passed through ministers - to enforce them as law of the land. The last time a monarch refused an order was more than 300 years ago. The Privy Council formally approves changes to the governance of institutions that are incorporated by a Royal Charter. The University of Cambridge was the first institution to be formed through a Royal Charter in 1231 and the BBC was formed through one in 1929. It is also the final court of appeal for the UK’s overseas territories, Crown dependencies and for some Commonwealth countries such as Jamaica and Barbados. David Cameron was formally sworn in as a privy counsellor three months after his election as Conservative leader in 2005. The swearing-in ceremony requires the new member to kiss the Queen’s hand and take a binding oath. However, the Privy Council website also states that there is a ""solemn affirmation"" available to those who cannot take the oath. The oath obliges all parties keep matters discussed at the meetings a secret - allowing the Prime Minister to share classified information with the leader of the opposition."

The official body said there was evidence to suggest that rain - combined with more workers being on summer holidays than in 2014 - were factors in the dramatic month-on-month decline. It measured a 1.3% reduction compared with August 2014 - the first year-on-year fall since May 2013. All work types reported declines in August, the ONS said, with new projects falling by 3.6%. The figures follow in the footsteps of a Government promise to build 200,000 affordable homes by 2020. Its plans to relax planning rules and for a Starter Homes scheme in England face a number of obstacles and have met fierce criticism from charities and unions. Under the project, properties must be offered for sale to first-time buyers under 40 years of age only. The homes must be priced at a discount of 20% below market rates - with a £450,000 maximum in London and £250,000 outside the capital - and those buyers would be unable to sell the house for five years. Critics have suggested the Starter Homes scheme risks stoking demand rather than desperately-needed supply which has been cited as a core reason for UK house prices continuing to creep up. Charities have argued that the Prime Minister's demand to create a revolution from ""generation rent to generation buy"" is irresponsible and firms will look to reach the price limits, leaving the worse off without access to homes. The construction industry has welcomed the relaxation of planning laws but the sector admits output growth is being hampered by a lack of skilled labour."

During the game skipper Steven Davis scored two of the history-making goals, with stand-in striker Josh Magennis grabbing the other. ""An unbelievable night,"" said Davis. ""We showed what we were all about, we couldn't ask for it to go any better.""  The result ends a run of 14 unsuccessful qualifying campaigns since Northern Ireland made it to the 1986 World Cup. The celebrations were jubilant at the final whistle, with O'Neill launched into the air and given the bumps by his players. But there was agony for Scotland, whose chances of qualification were ended by an injury-time equaliser from Poland. That result means Republic of Ireland could qualify if they defeat Poland on Sunday."

The 'Vote Leave' campaign includes Labour, Conservative and UKIP politicians. Financial clout comes from three prominent treasurers: Peter Cruddas, the banker and former Tory treasurer; millionaire Labour donor John Mills; and spread betting tycoon Stuart Wheeler - who has helped fund UKIP. Former Dixons chairman Lord Kalms and billionaire Phones4U founder John Caudwell are among the business people backing the group. UKIP's Douglas Carswell wants a campaign not concerned with party loyalties Other supporters include author Frederick Forsyth, Lord Trimble, and former Environment Secretary Owen Paterson. ""We must end the supremacy of EU law over UK law. If we vote to leave, then the £350m we send to Brussels every week can be spent on our priorities like the NHS,"" said Kate Hoey, co-chair of Labour's 'out' group. UKIP MP Douglas Carswell added: ""I look forward to building a campaign that has no interest in party loyalties and is focused on what is best for Britain and our friends in Europe."" :: Analysis: Focus On 'No' Leaves 'Yes' Void The umbrella group has published an ICM poll of almost 2,000 people that found 44% want to stay in the EU, while 39% want to leave. When asked how they would feel if the Prime Minister fails to win changes to re-establish the supremacy of UK law, the figures changed to 43% in favour of leaving and 38% to stay in. David Cameron has promised a vote on Britain's membership by the end of 2017, as well as pursuing re-negotiation of Britain's relationship with the EU. He says he hopes to secure changes that will allow him to back staying part of the union. Another group, Leave.EU, launched last month - backed by Nigel Farage - and will fight it out with Vote Leave to be designated the official campaign by the Electoral Commission. Vote Leave believes in EU reform - but is basing its campaign on the premise that the PM will fail to win meaningful changes. It wants a free trade deal and ""friendly cooperation"" with the 28-country bloc and an independent say at institutions such as the World Trade Organisation. The Leave.EU group however, is against fundamental EU principles altogether. Another collective, in favour of staying in the EU, is expected to launch next week."

Rob O'Neill had his home address published online earlier this week with a message calling on IS extremists to target him. The threat was published under the name Umm Hussain Britaniya - one of the aliases used by British jihadi Sally-Anne Jones - and labelled Mr O'Neill a ""number one target"". The 39-year-old told Fox News' Hannity show: ""I've been ready for this since we killed Osama bin Laden. ""I know how to defend myself. ""A lot of times when there's a bomb threat there's not a bomb. But it's the ones you don't see. So, everyone has to become more vigilant."" He added that the threats should act as a warning for all members of the military and law enforcement that could be targets for extremists. The Butte-Silver Bow Police Department in Montana said it was ""aware and is taking proper precautions"", The Montana Standard reported. The threat, posted on social media, reportedly said: ""I leave this info of Robert O'Neill for my brothers in America and Al Qaeda in the US as a number one target to eventually hunt down and kill."" It added that the attack would be revenge for Mr O'Neill ""travelling around America putting on seminars boasting about killing Sheikh Osama"", the Daily Mirror reported. Jones, 46, from Chatham, Kent, was put on a UN sanctions list last month which includes travel bans and asset freezes. She travelled to Syria in 2013 with her husband Junaid Hussain. Hussain was killed in a US drone strike in August. Jones is alleged to be a recruiter for IS. Mr O'Neill went public in 2014 with his role in the raid on bin Laden's compound in Pakistan, and featured in a Fox News interview discussing how the al Qaeda leader was killed. He was also part of the team who rescued the skipper of the Maersk Alabama from Somali pirates, which was immortalised in the Tom Hanks film Captain Phillips. He has since left the Navy SEALs after 16 years of service, including tours in Afghanistan and Iraq and earning two Silver Stars and four Bronze Stars. After going public, his father Tom O'Neill when questioned over security concerns replied: ""I say I'll paint a big target on my front door and say 'come and get us'."""

Karrissa Cox and Richard Carter were found not guilty of causing injury to their baby more than three years after they took the infant to hospital. The baby was bleeding from the mouth. Doctors also found bruising on the baby's body and ""healing fractures"" on an X-ray and feared that it had been abused. They recommended the child be taken into care by social services, which later found adoptive parents following a ruling of abuse by the family courts. Now, after being cleared of any charges, the parents have said they plan to launch a legal battle to overturn the adoption. However, lawyers have expressed doubts they will ever see the child again. In a statement, the pair, both 25, said: ""We took our child to the hospital seeking help and they stole our baby from us."" The couple were vindicated at Guildford Crown Court after defence experts found the child was suffering from a blood disorder called Von Willebrands II. The disorder causes a person to bruise easily. The child was also suffering from a vitamin D deficiency and infantile rickets. After contesting the defence expert evidence, the prosecution engaged an independent radiologist, who concluded he doubted there were any fractures. That led prosecutors to offer no evidence and not guilty verdicts to be entered. The couple, from Guildford, Surrey, had been allowed supervised contact with the child when in care until the youngster was adopted last year. Ms Cox told the Daily Mirror: ""It is heartbreaking to know our child is out there, living and breathing in someone else's arms. ""We miss our child a lot. We wish we had our child back. The pain has never got any less. We see people out and about with their children and can only think, 'Why us?' Why did they take our child away from us for no reason?"" Mr Carter, an Afghanistan war veteran, added: ""We will fight till our last breath. ""No parent should go through this ever. This just rips your soul away from you. We wouldn't wish this on anyone. ""We keep each other strong. We have lost three and a half years. We had contact but have missed everything our child has done. We have missed all those memories."" The couple's barrister, Michael Turner QC, said: ""These innocent parents have been spared a criminal conviction and a prison sentence for a crime they never committed. ""Their life sentence is that they are likely never to see their baby again."""

Delivering chocolates with no thought for his personal safety, the Bond-esque hero dodged sharks, jumped bridges and flew helicopters in a series of adverts beginning in the 1960s. ""All because the lady loves Milk Tray"" became one of TV's most quotable lines - but it's now 13 years since his last appearance. James Coombes in the new advert One of the original Milk Tray men, James Coombes, is appearing in a new TV ad where he looks for ""a new hero to deliver the famous box"". Coombes, who took on the part in 1987, said: ""I loved this role the first time around and nothing has changed since, so I'm sure whoever gets to fill my shoes will be just as delighted. Cadbury is looking for a new daredevil to deliver Milk Tray ""We're on the search for a modern Milk Tray Man, someone who is thoughtful yet adventurous and I'm really looking forward to seeing who it will be."" Anyone over 18 can register their interest - or nominate an adventurous, dashing friend - at a special Cadbury website. The winner will get a one-year contract to front the chocolate brand throughout 2016."

And few achievements have been as improbable as Northern Ireland’s in reaching next summer's European Championship finals in France. Seeded fifth in a qualifying group of five, ranked 129 in the world two years ago, their success is a triumph for teamwork, momentum, belief and perseverance. Manager Michael O'Neill, recruited from Shamrock Rovers in 2011, won one of his first 18 matches. Recognising the paucity of his playing resources and the possible futility of a change, his bosses stuck with him. Gallery: Celebrations After 30-Year Wait For Major Tournament Ended Manager Michael O'Neill is given the bumps after his Northern Ireland side ended their 30-year wait to qualify for a major tournament The rewards they now reap will be measured in the grassroots boost to football in the province, financial gains for beneficiaries ranging from the players themselves to travel companies ferrying fans to France, and the sheer feelgood factor. ""It's a huge achievement for the squad, and for the country,"" said captain Steven Davis, who scored two of the three goals that beat Greece to seal qualification on a euphoric night in Belfast. He praised O’Neill’s ""preparation and attention to detail"". The fact that the other scorer, Josh Magennis, plays for struggling Scottish Premiership team Kilmarnock, and was a goalkeeper only six years ago, tells you a lot about the achievement of O'Neill and his team. Just four of the Belfast starting 11 play regularly in the English Premier League, but this team have stayed strong, stayed together, and built on their flying start to this qualifying campaign (they won their first three matches). Magennis wasn't born when his country last reached a major tournament finals, the World Cup in 1986. Northern Ireland was a very different place then. As if to underline the point, with the Republic of Ireland simultaneously beating World Champions Germany, Sinn Fein deputy first minister Martin McGuinness tweeted: ""Incredible night for Irish football, congrats Martin and Michael O'Neill (managers) & both teams."" It is only football, after all. But it means a lot."

She wrote: ""Thank you for saying something when that man grabbed me. ""Thank you for insisting that it was not acceptable.

2015-10-09,The United Nations has proposed a national unity government in Libya in an attempt to end four years of unrest since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151009145420/http://news.sky.com/story/1566406/un-calls-for-unity-govt-in-libya-to-end-conflict,"The United Nations has proposed a national unity government in Libya in an attempt to end four years of unrest since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi. The country has been split between an Islamist-backed government based in Tripoli and an internationally recognised government in the country's east - with each side backed by rival alliances of armed factions. The UN proposal comes after months of negotiations between delegates from both sides, who have faced pressure from hardliners and from continued fighting on the ground that has halted part of Libya's oil production. Last week, US Secretary of State John Kerry and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged the governments to act quickly and reach a deal, warning that instability in the country was giving room for extremist groups like Islamic State to expand. At a news conference in Morocco, UN envoy Bernardino Leon said that Fayez Sarraj, a member of the Tripoli-based parliament, would be nominated as prime minister for the new government. Other candidates representing the country's east, west and south will fill ""a presidential council"", he added. ""We believe this list can work,"" said Mr Leon - but he added that ""it was not an easy task"". Mussa al Kouni, one of the proposed deputy prime ministers, said: ""The hardest part has just begun."" A new unity government has multiple challenges, including an economy near collapse, a number of active militia groups and severe needs for basic assistance. The UN says an estimated 2.44 million people in Libya - nearly 40% of the country's population - are in need of protection and some form of humanitarian aid. The chaos has led to tens of thousands of refugees and migrants making the dangerous journey across the Mediterranean to Europe in search of a better life. The British ambassador to Libya, Peter Millet, said of the proposed government: ""I think there is no better chance, and there is no alternative to this approach and to this sort of government, which tries to balance a lot of different interests. ""So I appeal again to the Libyan people to get behind it and give it the best possible chance for success."""

The 87-year-old showbiz veteran was admitted to hospital following the fall and has been told by doctors to rest for at least a week. Sir Bruce was set to take to the stage for his variety show - Sir Bruce's Hall of Fame - alongside names such as comedian Catherine Tate and Pointless presenter Alexander Armstrong. The show, which is expected to be screened in the new year, will now be compered by Armstrong in Sir Bruce's absence. The show's production company, Kalooki Pictures, said in a statement: ""This morning, Sir Bruce Forsyth slipped and fell at his home resulting in facial abrasions and minor concussion. ""He attended hospital and had a series of scans and tests all of which happily proved negative. ""However, because of his injury, he has been told by doctors he must have complete rest for at least seven days."" Speaking after his fall, Sir Bruce said: ""I was really looking forward to this show and working with such a talented cast, and I am really sad not to be part of it. ""It is now in the most capable hands of Alexander Armstrong and I would like to wish him, the guests and the whole production team good luck on Sunday."" It is not the first time Sir Bruce has had to pull out of work. In October 2013, he had to pull out of hosting Strictly Come Dancing after being taken ill with flu. Sir Bruce, the host of the series from 2004 to 2014, also missed a programme through illness in 2009. The producers of Strictly regularly scheduled rest weeks into Sir Bruce's schedule during the series to help him cope with the workload of fronting three months of weekly live programmes."

Privately, Nigel Farage was furious that the last day of his conference had been hijacked by a bitter exchange of views between two of UKIP's best known faces, Douglas Carswell and Aaron Banks. Both men are backing different campaigns: Mr Carswell the freshly launched Vote Leave, while Mr Banks is funding Leave.EU. Why does this civil war within UKIP matter? The two groups are vying to become the official Brexit campaign, which unlocks extra funding and gives them a platform at official debates. There are indications though the two could work together: Leave.EU issued a release this morning welcoming the rival's launch. This focus on the ""No"" camp leaves something of a void on the ""Yes"" side, which has stayed relatively quiet as the Prime Minister continues his attempts to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the EU. That effort continues today with bilateral meetings with the leaders of Estonia and Germany. You will have to wait until early next week for the launch of the official ""remain"" campaign. Reportedly both sides are attempting to secure Boris Johnson's endorsement. Expect regular bombardment from both campaigns, even though the referendum might not be held until 2017."
2015-10-09,"President Obama travelled to Roseburg, Oregon, on Friday to meet the families of victims killed in the mass shooting at a community college last week.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151009145420/http://news.sky.com/story/1566344/outrage-over-gun-store-next-to-us-school,"By Amanda Walker, US Correspondent President Obama travelled to Roseburg, Oregon, on Friday to meet the families of victims killed in the mass shooting at a community college last week. His visit came as America grapples with how to respond to the latest gun-related massacre. With every mass shooting comes heightened fear over guns being anywhere near schools or colleges. In McLean, Virginia, parents are dealing with the arrival of a shop that sells high-powered weapons and handguns right next door to Franklin Sherman elementary school. On the morning school run, dad Matt Rampy said: ""I'm outraged - I think it's terrible that you have a guns store in such close proximity. ""In Virginia we have an open carry law that allows you to carry a weapon on your belt without a permit. Spencer May says pupils have to practise a 'lockdown' ""When you have that so close to a school you have an inability to assess whether you have a threat or not."" Nova Firearms opened on the school's doorstep days before the massacre in Oregon. The distance from the school is certainly striking - they share a back perimeter.  A classroom used everyday by the children is a stone's throw from the unassuming white building that houses and sells lethal weapons. Store manager Rachel Dresser says some parents have told her they support the store being there and think it could even protect their children: ""Having people with firearms that are trained would actually be a deterrent for anyone to do anything in this area including the elementary school because there would be people in such close proximity to respond."" Gun enthusiasts and the National Rifle Association are rallying behind the shop. While we were filming they had numerous calls from members of the public - one from as far away as Hawaii - offering their support as parents vow to have the store moved. Michelle May is already disturbed by seven-year old son Spencer having to learn lockdown drills in case of a mass shooting. He told us what happens: ""It's really scary because the teacher turns down the shades and locks the door and puts the black thing - like a little cover for the windows - to see if anyone's in there and you have to hide in one place and be silent."" I asked whether she thinks the gun store makes her son safer. ""What is having a gun store next to it going to do for the school?"" asks Michelle May. ""Like the gunshop owner's going to come out out with a loaded gun and play hero?"" Thirteen miles down the road on Capitol Hill the gun debate is back on the agenda with presidential hopefuls and other Democrats once again pushing their control proposals. But the chances of a change in legislation are slim. ""It's not very likely we're going to see any change as far as the laws go on gun control,"" says Paige Lavender, senior politics editor at the Huffington Post. ""The fact of the matter is that Obama is a Democrat and Republicans control the House and the Senate. ""Even though these Democratic senators are putting this legislation forth, Republicans are going to be able to stop it."" Statistically, there has been a mass killing in the US everyday this year. That more will follow is beyond doubt. For now, America is a long way from solving its inevitable daily tragedy."
2015-10-09,Russia has rejected US claims that four of its missiles crashed into Iran rather than reaching intended targets in Syria.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151009145420/http://news.sky.com/story/1566329/syria-crisis-russian-missiles-crash-in-iran,"Russia has rejected US claims that four of its missiles crashed into Iran rather than reaching intended targets in Syria. Moscow launched the attack from warships stationed in the Caspian Sea. It said 26 cruise missiles flew 900 miles across Iran and Iraq before hitting Islamic State targets, including plants for making shells and explosives. But US defence secretary, Ash Carter, has hit back saying that the US had indications that Russian cruise missiles did malfunction. ""This will boomerang in a very direct way on Russian security but it absolutely has the affect of inflaming IS and extremism,"" he said. His comments come after an unnamed US government source told Reuters that four missiles had crashed before reaching their targets. A Russian defence spokesman says that report is not true. ""We do not talk with reference to anonymous sources,"" Major General Igor Konashenkov is quoted by Interfax as saying. ""We show the launch of our rockets and the targets they struck."" Syria's top general said on Thursday that the missiles hit targets in Raqqa and Aleppo in the north and Idlib province in the northwest. In a rare televised statement, General Ali Ayoub said Russian strikes provided cover for government forces to launch an offensive against Islamic State fighters and other rebel forces. US Secretary of State John Kerry directly phoned his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov on Thursday amid growing tensions between the two countries because of uncoordinated strategies in Syria. ""The Secretary repeated (US) concerns about the preponderance of targets that are being struck by Russian military forces that are not (Islamic State)-related,"" US department spokesman John Kirby said. However, he added that ""no tactical level decisions"" were made during the call. Russia has faced strong international criticism in recent days following the decision to launch airstrikes in Syria. The West remains sceptical of Russia's motives, believing the attacks are more designed to support Syrian President Bashar al Assad rather than defeat Islamic State. The former head of the British Army, Lord Dannatt, told Sky News that it is crucial for the West and Russia to work together on a common strategy for Syria. ""We're quite rightly concerned about Mr Putin's... much more overt, aggressive involvement in the Syrian crisis,"" he said. ""But what we should be doing - I'm convinced we should be doing this - is setting up some sort of contact group with all interested parties. ""The West has got to engage in a more meaningful way with Russia than we're currently doing."" He has also suggested that given Mr Assad is not a direct threat to the West, the sole focus at this stage should be on Islamic State. ""The key question to ask (is)... do we really want to get rid of President Assad? Or is defeating Islamic State our major objective?” ""As despicable as President Assad's behaviour has been in his country, the bigger evil that we are dealing with and confronting is the challenge to all our security... (is) from Islamic State. ""Deal with that first, deal with President Assad second."" NATO defence ministers met on Thursday to discuss Russia’s military action in Syria, including recent incursions into Turkish airspace. Speaking ahead of the meeting, NATO's Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned that member countries were prepared to ""defend and protect"" allies from any foreign threat. The UK has decided to deploy British troops in the Baltic to counter ""Russian aggression"" and demonstrate support for its NATO allies. Russia said it would respond to the deployment with ""parity""."
2015-10-26,"History is being lost with the closure of many gay bars, pubs and clubs, it has been claimed.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151026122444/http://news.sky.com/story/1575694/history-being-lost-as-gay-venues-close,"By Richard Suchet, Sky News Correspondent History is being lost with the closure of many gay bars, pubs and clubs, it has been claimed. Numerous gay venues are said to be struggling financially because a more open-minded society has had a detrimental impact on customer numbers, as gay people can now socialise in places where they might previously have felt uncomfortable. Their business woes have been exacerbated by dating apps and websites, which make it easier than ever to meet like-minded people. Historic England, which advises central and local government on the protection of historical sites and buildings, is asking the public for assistance in finding, recording and protecting places with a rich lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) past. The New Penny in Leeds, which is hoping for 'listed' status Rosie Sherrington from Historic England told Sky News: ""A lot of this history is being lost. It's very temporary a lot of this history. ""The places where gay, lesbian and trans people used to meet were often illegal. They were hidden. ""You had to go up a secret passage and knock on a door. ""That stuff is very easily lost and forgotten but actually these were the sorts of places that were pioneering in terms of politics, art, culture, music, fashion."" It is not known exactly how many LGBT venues have disappeared in recent years but it is thought that hundreds have likely closed since the 1990s. Last month the Royal Vauxhall Tavern in South London, one of the UK's oldest gay venues, became the first building to be given ""listed"" status because of its LGBT history. The pub, built on land that was originally part of the Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens, was first used as a Victorian music hall. The campaign to preserve it after it was sold to property developers was backed by a number of celebrities including Sir Ian McKellen and Paul O'Grady. ""What this listing does, is it sends a signal that actually there are some spaces that do have a real value, which maybe can't be measured in real estate terms,"" said Ben Walters, a spokesperson for the campaign. ""But it is something that makes society a better place for everyone. ""It really says that our history, our story, is just as valid a part of our national history as anyone else's story. ""And I think that's something that enriches everyone."" Inspired by the Royal Vauxhall Tavern campaign, the Deputy Leader of Leeds City Council James Lewis is hoping to secure similar recognition for the oldest gay venue outside of London. The New Penny Pub in The Calls area of Leeds was a gay bar before homosexuality was decriminalised. Mr Lewis, who is the council's LGBT community champion, described the move as a ""really positive step forward"". He said: ""It's an opportunity for a city like Leeds to put the contribution of the LGBT community on the map and celebrate the contribution our LGBT community has made to the city."" One of the pub's customers said it is a ""pillar of the community"". ""It represents everything that has been fought for in the past and it's also a beacon towards the future. ""To let people be who they want to be in a safe environment. ""And for it to be listed means it will be there, passed from generation to generation for everyone that comes after us."" Blue plaques - issued by English Heritage - are another way of marking a building's historical significance but these do not offer any kind of special protection from demolition or development."

The former prime minister also admitted there was ""elements of truth"" in the view that the 2003 invasion was the ""principal cause"" of Islamic State's rise. Mr Blair spoke about the war during an interview on US television in which he expressed regret over some aspects of the conflict. ""I apologise for the fact that the intelligence we received was wrong,"" he told CNN in an interview due to be aired later on Sunday. ""I also apologise for some of the mistakes in planning and, certainly, our mistake in our understanding of what would happen once you removed the regime."" But Mr Blair said he did not regret ousting Saddam Hussein. ""I find it hard to apologize for removing Saddam,"" Mr Blair said. ""I think, even from today in 2015, it is better that he's not there than that he is there."" Asked if the Iraq War was ""the principal cause"" of the rise of Islamic State, the former Labour leader said: ""I think there are elements of truth in that."" He added: ""Of course you can't say those of us who removed Saddam in 2003 bear no responsibility for the situation in 2015. ""But it's important also to realise, one, that the Arab Spring which began in 2011 would also have had its impact on Iraq today, and two, ISIS actually came to prominence from a base in Syria and not in Iraq."" His apology has led to claims Mr Blair is trying to ""spin"" the response to the long-delayed Chilcot Inquiry. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""The Blair spin operation begins but the country still awaits the truth. ""The delay to Chilcot report is a scandal."" No date has yet been given for the release of the Chilcot Inquiry's final conclusions. The inquiry was established more than six years ago by former prime minister Gordon Brown, who said it would take a year to complete. Relatives of soldiers killed in the conflict have threatened legal action if a date is not fixed soon. A spokeswoman for Mr Blair said: ""Tony Blair has always apologised for the intelligence being wrong and for mistakes in planning. ""He has always also said, and says again here, that he does not however think it was wrong to remove Saddam. ""He did not say the decision to remove Saddam in 2003 'caused ISIS' and pointed out that ISIS was barely heard of at the end of 2008, when al Qaeda was basically beaten. ""He went on to say in 2009, Iraq was relatively more stable. “What then happened was a combination of two things: there was a sectarian policy pursued by the government of Iraq, which were mistaken policies. ""But also when the Arab Spring began, ISIS moved from Iraq into Syria, built themselves from Syria and then came back into Iraq. All of this he has said before."""

Witnesses described how bodies were thrown dozens of feet into the air when the Hyundai Elantra slammed into the crowd in Stillwater, near Oklahoma City. The vehicle crashed through barricades and struck an unmanned police motorcycle before ploughing into spectators. Police said 47 people were injured in the crash, including five who were in a critical condition. The three adults who were killed have been named as 23-year-old Nakita Prabhakar from Edmond, and Bonnie Jean Stone and Marvin Lyle Stone, both aged 65 and from Stillwater. Gallery: Four Killed At Homecoming Parade Crash People attend to the injured at the scene Adacia Avery Chambers, 25, has been taken into custody on suspicion of driving while under the influence of alcohol. The suspect's father, Floyd Chambers, told The Oklahoman newspaper that he learned about the incident via social media and was stunned. ""I can't figure this out. This is not the person that's my daughter,"" he said. ""I can't imagine alcohol being involved. She is not an alcoholic that I'm aware of."" Representatives for OU Medical Center in Oklahoma City said the hospital treated eight victims from the crash, five of them children. One of those patients, a two-year-old boy, later died. Dave Kapple from Houston told the Stillwater News Press that he and his son were about 10ft away from the crash site. ""We heard somebody scream, 'Look out!.' (He) ploughed through a police motorcycle, and then a crowd of people,"" he said. ""People were flying everywhere."" Konda Walker, from Anchorage, Alaska, was also nearby. She told the News Press: ""At first we thought it was part of the show. People were flying 30ft into the air like rag dolls."" Geoff Haxton, who went to the parade with his children, said: ""I just saw smoke and saw the panic in people's faces as they ran away from the scene."" Oklahoma State University chose not to cancel its homecoming football game in the wake of the accident. The game went ahead as planned against Kansas, and was dedicated to the victims. ""We are shocked and heartbroken by this horrible tragedy,"" said the school's president, V. Burns Hargis. ""The Oklahoma State University Homecoming parade is the most wholesome of events and to have it marred in such a way is incomprehensible."""
2015-10-26,"Employers are to be forced to reveal how much they pay staff in bonuses, in a move aimed at closing the gender pay gap being proposed by David Cameron.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151026122444/http://news.sky.com/story/1575681/bonuses-to-be-revealed-in-pay-gap-details,"By Jon Craig, Chief Political Correspondent Employers are to be forced to reveal how much they pay staff in bonuses, in a move aimed at closing the gender pay gap being proposed by David Cameron. Public sector employers will also have to reveal how much they pay men and women staff and the Government also hopes to outlaw male-only boards of directors. But while the moves have been welcomed by equality campaigners and union leaders, the employers' organisation the CBI has dismissed them as ""box-ticking"". The measures are part of an equal pay drive signalled by the Prime Minister in a speech in the summer and again at the Tory conference earlier this month. In July he said he wanted to ""end the gender pay gap in a generation"" and at the Conservative Party conference earlier this month he talked about his own family and equal pay. ""I'm a dad of two daughters,"" he said. ""Opportunity won't mean anything to them if they grow up in a country where they get paid less because of their gender rather than how good they are at their work."" Now the Prime Minister is declaring: ""You can't have true opportunity without equality. There is no place for a pay gap in today's society and we are delivering on our promises to address it."" The gender pay gap is currently estimated at 19%. The new rules will apply to firms and organisations employing more than 250 people and apply to a total of 10 million workers across the UK. The proposals are based on recommendations by the former Trade Minister, Lord Davies, who has proposed a target of one in four board members being women by 2020. Welcoming the move on revealing bonuses, the Chartered Management Institute's chief executive Ann Francke told Sky News: ""One of the biggest drivers of gender pay discrepancy, especially at senior levels, is the bonus gap. ""Bonuses are also where gender bias can creep in easily as they are amongst the least transparent forms of pay. ""There's a tendency to reward those in our own image or to think that because men may be the 'main breadwinners' they deserve higher bonuses. And men often negotiate harder or trumpet their achievements more readily."" But Neil Carberry, the CBI's Director for Employment and Skills, said: ""Eradicating the gender pay gap is an important goal, but to be truly effective, gender pay gap reporting must be relevant to each company rather than a box-ticking exercise. ""Companies recognise the value of having a diverse board that reflects society and their customers, so we look forward to working with the Government to end all-male boards in the FTSE 350 and elsewhere, building on the successful voluntary approach pioneered by Lord Davies. ""And to continue progress, we need to challenge occupational stereotypes by encouraging more women into male dominated industries and strengthening careers advice."""

John Rodgers, 28, and his wife Lynette, 26, died after getting caught in a rip tide at Plettenberg Bay - six days after they walked down the aisle. In a joint statement their families, from County Down in Northern Ireland, said: ""It has come as a great shock to both the Reilly and Rodgers families to learn of the sudden and tragic events in South Africa, which has taken the lives of Lynette and John.

The body of Mr Rodgers was discovered in shallow surf on Robberg Beach by a local man at about 6pm on Friday. Robberg Beach, Plettenberg Bay His wife's body was found about 200 metres away along the same beach. Doctors tried to resuscitate the couple but they were pronounced dead. Their relatives have requested privacy to grieve. Local MLA Gordon Dunne, who knows the family, said the close-knit County Down community was numb. He said: ""I am very shocked and saddened by the tragic news of the death of this young couple on their honeymoon in South Africa. ""This is an absolutely tragedy and my heartfelt sympathy goes out to the family of both the young man and young lady who have sadly passed away.

Lorry driver Darren Kelly was stabbed to death a few miles from his home in Basildon, Essex, this week. The 15-year-old girl, from Pitsea, is one of four people charged with murder. A 17-year-old boy from Pitsea and a 16-year-old boy from Basildon, none of whom can be named for legal reasons, stood alongside her at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court. Chris Carroll, 20, of Pevensey Close, Pitsea, appeared at a separate hearing earlier on Saturday. The girl flashed the peace sign at her tearful family and mouthed ""I love you"" as she was led out of the dock. Carroll, meanwhile, smiled and yawned as he entered the courtroom. Members of his family shouted ""love you Chris"" at the end of the hearing and he replied ""love you"". All of the defendants wore red tracksuits and spoke only to confirm their names, ages and addresses. They will remain in custody until their appearance at Chelmsford Crown Court on 27 October. Mr Kelly staggered to a block of flats seeking help after being stabbed on Tuesday night. Bystanders fought to save his life but he died at hospital. A post-mortem examination revealed the cause of death to be stab wounds and blood loss. A 13-year-old girl from Basildon who was arrested on suspicion of murder has been released on police bail until 16 December. :: Witnesses should contact Essex Police on 101, email scdappeals@essex.pnn.police.uk or call Crimestoppers on 0800 555111."

Frank Field told Sky News' Murnaghan programme he and a ""huge number"" of his party colleagues stand ready to campaign for anyone ousted from their seat. ""If we are going to get a purge of those who don't agree with a particular line, I think it's very important for those in the party who believe in free speech ... that we collectively - after all we're the party of the collective - we actually say that a huge number of us, if anyone is picked off, they should call a by-election immediately and we all campaign for them,"" Mr Field said. ""They can't expel huge tranches of Labour MPs. So let the so-called radicals do what they wish but they should know that we are not going to be like individual rabbits staring at the headlights, but there will be a collective response."" Mr Field himself successfully fought off a deselection attempt by the left-wing Militant group in the 1980s.  Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell has said there was ""no way"" left-wing activists would be allowed to force out MPs. ""We are opposing any threat to individual MPs. We are not in favour of reselection of these MPs,"" he told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show. ""The democratic processes in the Labour position will take place in the normal way. ""There is no way we will allow MPs to be deselected in that way. We will work together on this."" But he added that moderate Labour MPs must ""come to terms"" with the party's new direction. Last month, Simon Danczuk told Sky News he believed he was on a list of Labour MPs being targeted by Mr Corbyn's supporters who were trying to oust him. Sources close to Mr Corbyn said the allegations were without foundation. Mr Danczuk has also said he would try to oust Mr Corbyn as leader if the party flopped in May's devolved and local elections. The Rochdale MP said he could stand as a ""stalking horse"" challenger to open the door to more established colleagues such as Chuka Umunna, Dan Jarvis and Emma Reynolds to mount a challenge before the next election to ""give us some chance of winning"". In response, Mr McDonnell said: ""That is Simon being Simon isn't it? There will be people who have to come to terms with the change and they will do it slowly but they will."""

More than 100 civilians say they were criminally abused and ill-treated during an eight-year period in the conflict. The allegations have been made by civilians who say they were detained by British Forces during Operation Herrick between 2005 - 2013. The Royal Military Police (RMP) has launched Operation Northmoor to examine the historical allegations of criminal abuse. Minister for the Armed Forces Penny Mordaunt has branded some of the legal claims ""ludicrous"". She warned that the allegations are costing the British taxpayer tens of millions of pounds. The Ministry of Defence (MOD) has already spent millions on investigations and compensation following allegations of wrongdoing in Iraq and Afghanistan. Ms Mordaunt, said: ""I am extremely concerned about recent legal developments that call into question the Armed Forces' ability to operate effectively. ""These have also facilitated a large number of compensation claims and judicial reviews which are time-consuming and can cost the taxpayer tens of millions of pounds. ""The MoD is looking closely at this issue and as the Government's manifesto made clear, we will ensure our Armed Forces overseas are not subject to persistent and sometimes ludicrous legal claims that undermine their ability to do their job. ""Ministers have commissioned detailed work on this and will make any further announcements in due course."""

And a Spillers and Bakers ""Pilot"" biscuit which was on board a lifeboat was bought for £15,000. The grainy iceberg picture, which was expected to fetch more than £10,000, was taken on the morning of 15 April, 1912, several hours after the historic collision that happened just before midnight. Auctioneers said the original image was captured by the chief steward of the steamer Prinz Adalbert which passed the iceberg. The biscuit that was on board a lifeboat was bought for £15,000 There was reportedly red paint on one side of the iceberg, suggesting it was scraped by a ship. The Titanic sank just over two hours after the collision with the loss of more than 1,500 lives. Meanwhile, a cup presented by Titanic survivor Margaret Brown to Sir Arthur Rostron, the captain of rescue ship Carpathia, has sold for £130,000 at the same auction organised by Henry Aldridge & Son in Wiltshire. Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge told Sky News: ""The prices reflect the eternal interest in the Titanic story and the iconic nature of the objects concerned."" The cup was the third most expensive Titanic-related artefact ever sold after a violin went for £1m in 2013 and a 32ft-long plan of the ship from the British Titanic inquiry was sold for £220,000 in 2011. The cup had been expected to go for more than £50,000. The American socialite Margaret Brown, who later famously became known as the ""unsinkable Molly Brown"", survived the sinking which happened during its maiden voyage to New York from Southampton. Ms Brown presented the sterling silver cup to Sir Arthur Henry Rostron in a ceremony in New York the following month. He and his crew rescued 705 Titanic survivors.

Police were called in to Amite Elementary School in Amite City, Louisiana, after he showed the pistol to his classmate. US officers believe the child got hold of the weapon while he was on his way to school after it was left unattended in his mother's car. Amite Police Chief Jerry Trabona told Fox News: ""I'm assuming she had it laying on the seat and he just reached down there, got it and put it in his book sack. ""She doesn't remember where the gun was."" The boy's parents, Kenji Steptow, 36, and 30-year-old Kenisha Steptow, have been charged with child desertion. Chief Trabona said the charge was the toughest the law would allow. He added: ""If the baby would have been thinking it's a play gun and shot somebody with it, you don't know where that bullet is going. ""It was a semi-automatic. If he would have pulled it, he could have pulled it again. There was another bullet ready to go."" Some parents at the school said they were shocked when the news leaked out. Parent Michelle Brumfield said: ""I freaked out because I'm trying to figure out, where's my child? Is she ok? What part was isolated? What happened?"" Police said the gun is registered. The youngster, who has not been named, has been released into the custody of a family member, Chief Trabona said.  He said it was most likely the child thought the gun was a toy."

Kezia Dugdale wants her party to be in full control of policy-making decisions, candidate selection and party membership. These could include having different policies from Westminster on critical issues such as welfare, she said. She told Sky's Murnaghan programme that essential changes had to be made to how the party was run to regain the trust of the Scottish people. ""I won the Scottish Labour leadership contest with a tremendous mandate - 72% of the vote, to do exactly this; to lead an autonomous Scottish Labour Party, where decisions about our policies, who stands for us and the direction of our party are made in Scotland,"" she said. ""That's what people the length and breadth of the country want to see."" Ms Dugdale - who was elected leader in August - also urged the party to ""learn the mistakes"" of Scottish Labour. She told Murnaghan: ""My appeal is to people across the UK Labour Party - see this as the start of a debate that you can have a big part in. ""Learn the mistakes of Scottish Labour, don't repeat them, there's a chance here to reform and innovate how our party is organised and structured, if we get it right then our party will be in a much better and fitter position for the future."" Scottish Labour autonomy has been a significant topic of discussion for party members since the independence referendum. When former leader Johann Lamont resigned last Autumn she said the Scottish party was treated like a ""branch office"" by the London leadership. Party members will discuss policy positions at the Scottish Labour conference in Perth this week."

Frigate HMS Richmond has arrived to join EU patrols off the coast of Libya. The patrols are aimed at stopping human traffickers who offer to take refugees on a dangerous - and often fatal - journey to Europe. HMS Enterprise is already gathering intelligence in the region but was needed to save almost 400 migrants last month after Italian authorities were overwhelmed. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon vowed to ""hit the traffickers hard"". A UN resolution means HMS Richmond's commanding officer will have powers to board and seize boats suspected to be involved in people smuggling. Mr Fallon added: ""These new powers are an important step forward. We will now be able to board the boats and detain the smugglers. ""Sending HMS Richmond to join HMS Enterprise in the Mediterranean shows Britain's determination to tackle this trade in human misery at source."" The announcement follows the landing of four migrant boats at an RAF air base in Cyprus on Wednesday. Some 600,000 migrants have arrived in the EU by boat so far this year. About 475,000 have landed in Greece and 137,000 in Italy, according to the International Organisation for Migration. The body estimates that more than 2,000 people have died trying to make the crossing in 2015. HMS Enterprise replaced HMS Bulwark, which saved 3,000 lives in the Mediterranean, in July."

It comes as Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov indicated that the Kremlin wanted Syria to prepare for elections. At a meeting in Damascus Mr Assad reportedly told Russian politicians he was ready to stage a ballot if the Syrian people supported the idea. Russia news agency RIA quoted politician Alexander Yushchenko as saying: ""Assad said that if the Syrian people consider it necessary, he would not be against taking part in presidential elections."" Interfax news agency cited the same politician as saying Mr Assad also expressed a willingness to discuss amendments to Syria's constitution and hold parliamentary elections. However, Syrian state media made no mention of Mr Assad's response to the Russian proposal in its initial report on the meeting. Mr Assad did say that ""eliminating terrorist groups will lead to the political solution we aim for in Syria and Russia"", according to Syrian TV. Russia, a key international ally for the Assad regime, began bombing opposition rebels and Islamic State targets in September.  A week after Russia launched its airstrikes, Syrian ground troops, helped by allied fighters from Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah, pushed their way into central and northern Syria to try to drive rebel and militant groups out. So far, Syrian forces are reported to have seized some villages but have not yet had any strategic victory. Mr Assad made a surprise visit to Moscow this week to discuss the intervention. It was the first known trip abroad taken by the Syrian leader since his country's civil war began in 2011. More than 250,000 people are reported to have died in the conflict."

A freight train was derailed as two strong storm systems, one the remnants of the hurricane, pounded the US state on Saturday. It comes after Patricia, which was at one point the strongest ever storm recorded in the Western Hemisphere, caused less damage than feared in Mexico. The freight train was derailed after a creek burst its banks Thousands fled in advance of it making landfall on the country's western coast, but it appears major damage has been avoided as the storm missed tourist centres like Puerto Vallarta and the cargo port of Manzanillo. However, it did carve through small rural villages, ripping corrugated metal roofing off modest brick homes and uprooting trees, with the forceful winds sucking the leaves off them. As the clean-up there begins, Texas is now feeling the effects of the storm's remnants, combined with a separate weather system. Navarro County, about 50 miles (80km) south of Dallas, was one of the worst affected areas, with the small town of Powell being inundated with 20 inches (50cm) of rain over 30 hours, according to Accuweather meteorologist Brett Rathbun. The Union Pacific freight train came off the tracks near Corsicana, where a creek had burst its banks and washed away the rails. No injuries were reported. County authorities requested sandbags for homes that have been evacuated due to flooding and Interstate 45 closed in some parts of Navarro County due to rising waters, stranding drivers. Since Friday, about 75 water rescues from vehicles, homes and businesses have taken place in the area, Sheriff Elmer Tanner said. ""I've been in Navarro County my whole life and I've never seen a rain event like this here,"" he said. ""We've had over 14 inches of rain today. I've never seen anything close to that, to have that much rainfall at one time."" There have been no confirmed casualties so far but in San Antonio a woman reported that her boyfriend was swept into a drainage ditch as he walked his dog. Saturday's rainfall caused the cancellation of about 100 flights at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, according to tracking service FlightAware. As evening fell on Saturday and the storm moved eastward, cities in Texas' Gulf of Mexico region, including Houston, braced for potential floods. Rain systems intensified by Patricia, which is now a tropical depression after hitting Mexico's west coast as a powerful hurricane with winds of 165mph, were pushing across the state. With rain falling at a rate of four inches per hour, rivers are swollen and the creaks upstream are loading with the inevitable prospect of more flash flooding throughout Sunday and Monday. Forecasters predict eight to 12in (20-30cm) of rain will hit the coastal area by Monday morning, combined with tides of up to 5ft (1.5m). The heavy rain also affected the US Grand Prix, with qualifying having to be pushed back and eventual winner world champion Lewis Hamilton comparing the treacherous conditions to ""playing with a rattlesnake""."

""As you'd expect, we encrypt and store this information securely. ""From our investigations, we are confident that the information which appeared online did not come from British Gas."" The data was uploaded to Pastebin, a temporary text uploading website, and discovered by British Gas during routine online checks. The firm removed the data on Wednesday evening. The company could not confidently pin down a cause for the leak but said it was ""someone external"", and one possible explanation could be that customers had been victims of a targeted phishing attack. On Tuesday evening Marks & Spencer had to suspend its website after customers were able to see other people's details when they logged in to their accounts. The company said no one's details were compromised by the ""internal technical problem"". Last week phone and broadband provider TalkTalk was targeted in a cyber attack in which it said bank account numbers and sort codes, like those printed on a cheque, may have been accessed. A joint operation between the Met's cyber crime unit, the PSNI's cyber crime centre and the National Crime Agency is ongoing into the incident."

Malcolm Millman, 58, had been allowed out from Chadwick Lodge, a medium security care unit in Milton Keynes, on a trip to a monastery near Hemel Hempstead, about 50 miles away. Thames Valley Police said he absconded at around 2pm and was last seen at Manchester Airport. Police, who believe he could be a potential risk to the public because of his previous convictions, have released CCTV images of him shown on the day he disappeared. Millman is white, of large build, bald with thinning brown hair on the sides, and has brown eyes. He was last seen wearing a brown jacket, purple jumper, grey tracksuit bottoms, and blue and white trainers. He was carrying a walking stick. He is also known by a number of names including: Richard Simon Barber, Michael Geoffrey Newman and Raymond Pilkington. Police believe Millman travelled from Hemel Hempstead to London on Saturday, possibly by train and, they think he then took a train to Leeds and was in the city between 6am and 8am on Sunday. The last sighting of him is at Manchester Airport where he was seen on CCTV just before 1pm on Monday - he is not thought to have a passport. Millman has links to Kent, and Canterbury specifically. Superintendent Olly Wright said: ""Millman was convicted of rape in 1996 and was due to serve 12 years, however he was working towards his full release while under the care at Chadwick Lodge. ""Based on Millman's previous convictions, including rape, we believe he is a potential risk to the public. If any members of the public see Millman do not approach him, instead call 999."" He added: ""I would like to stress that we do not believe Millman has access to a passport, however he may have taken a train or a bus from Manchester Airport to another location within the city or another part of the United Kingdom. ""If you think you saw Millman as he travelled from Hemel Hempstead to London, Leeds and Manchester then please call police on 101. ""Further, if you are reading this and have any information whatsoever about Millman's whereabouts then please contact police immediately."" Anyone who has information and does not want to speak to police direct can contact independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."

In an interview with Rolling Stone Magazine, the 64-year-old said: ""My kids are now 10 and 14 and they want to see what their dad does. ""They were in nappies when I was last on the road ... I'd like to take them out so they can enjoy it."" While saying he did not want  a very long tour, Collins did hint he would like to play ""stadiums in Australia and the Far East"". The former Genesis frontman also revealed he is moving a studio into his home in Miami, where he plans to start recording new music in November. He last released new material in 2002.  Across his career Collins has sold over 100 million albums worldwide, making him one of the most successful musicians of all time."

The multi-billion pound ""interconnector"" could allow geothermal energy from Iceland to be pumped directly to Britain. On a visit to Iceland, David Cameron, who is the first British Prime Minister to visit Reykjavik since Winston Churchill in 1941, will announce a task-force has been established to examine the feasibility of the project. If there is a successful outcome then the giant hydro-electricity cable between the two countries could be built within a decade. Iceland gets around 95% of its power from hydro and geothermal energy. Officials said that establishing a long-term source of renewable energy for Britain would provide greater security. There are continuing threats of power blackouts because of the lack of energy capacity.  Homeowners were warned earlier this year they could face higher energy bills again this year because of the closure of some power stations. Mr Cameron has been holding talks about establishing closer energy ties with his Icelandic counterpart Sigmundur Davio Gunnlaugsson ahead of the Northern Future Forum which joins the UK with leaders from Scandinavia and the Baltic states. Ministers have been in talks with Iceland over the possibility of harnessing the country's geothermal power since 2012."
2015-10-29,"Television channels are, according to Eddie Cue, dreadfully old fashioned. They should be apps instead.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151029152404/http://news.sky.com/story/1577929/apple-exec-tv-channels-are-old-fashioned,"By Tom Cheshire, Technology Correspondent Television channels are, according to Eddie Cue, dreadfully old fashioned. They should be apps instead. Since 2007 and the launch of the iPhone, the Cupertino-based firm has been trying to turn everything into apps, and mostly succeeding. Now, television is in its sights, with the launch of the new Apple TV. Cue is a senior Apple executive who has been at the company since 1989 and who heads its software efforts. He told Sky News: ""Looking at the world by channels is sort of backwards. ""The numbers of a TV guide never made much sense. ""What you really want to say, is I want to watch Sky News, I don't want to say what channel number Sky News is."" The new Apple TV turns your screen into a series of tiles. Users browse with the new remote, which has a touch sensitive panel, or by barking orders at Siri. It's slick and quick, and Siri works effectively. Ask it to show you the episode of Friends with Brad Pitt in it, and it takes you straight there. Over the last few months, he has also overseen the launches of Apple News and Apple Music. That has put Apple even closer in competition with the other tech giants: Facebook (which has its own news effort with Instant Articles), Amazon (with its own video services), and Google (with YouTube). The battle for your attention is fierce. Each of these technology companies wants people to spend more time on their services, meaning that they can sell more advertising, devices and subscriptions. Apple thinks privacy and security is a useful weapon in that war. Cue said: ""Those are things that we are building and thinking about as we're designing the product, building the product and shipping the product, and while we're running the product. It can't be an afterthought."" Security for Apple means encryption. Minister for internet safety and security Baroness Shields recently described it as ""alarming"" and it is expected to provoke debate in the forthcoming Investigatory Powers Bill, which will legislate how security services intercept people's communications. Asked about the UK government's less-than-enthusiastic attitude towards end-to-end encryption, Cue said: ""If you want to protect something, you can't have back doors. ""You can't have other ways out. Because once that exists, then others can take advantage of it. ""Encryption is necessary and it's effective."""

They hope the images might prompt someone to come forward with a vital clue after the discovery on the M54 in August. West Mercia Police say the man had lain undiscovered for at least three years. A road worker found the remains in Telford, Shropshire, and now - after months of work by forensic experts - police have a full DNA profile. However, detectives say they are still unsure how he died. The man is thought to have been aged between 30 and his late 40s and between 5ft 7in and 5ft 11in tall. A close-up of the jacket's logo He had two bracelets, one believed to be a Kara bracelet normally worn by Sikhs. He was also wearing a navy blue George at Asda T-shirt, dark Nike tracksuit bottoms and a black ""dare2be"" jacket. Detective Chief Inspector Neil Jamieson said: ""It has taken some considerable time for us to piece together a description of this individual. ""We are keeping an open mind as to how the man came to be in such a location and how he died; however, I cannot rule out that he may have been subjected to a crime, and that is something the public can help me with. The bracelet is beleived to be a Sikh Kara ""The metal bracelets are obviously a line of inquiry and as such we have been in contact with our Sikh community locally to share this and again ask for any information as to who this man is.

Lord Davies has called for women to make up a third of all boardroom positions at Britain's top 350 firms by 2020 as he releases his report. The former trade minister's report says that although 26% of board positions are now held by women - reaching the ""major milestone"" of 25% - that target should now be 33% for FTSE350 firms. A key issue identified in the report is the lack of women at executive level - instead they are filling non executive positions. There are just five women chief executives in FTSE100 firms and nine in FTSE 250 firms. Lord Davies, whose previous report in 2011 recommended the 25% by 2015 target, told Sky News there had been ""enormous progress"" in the last four years but more needed to be done. He said: ""The talent is there. I think what we now need over the next five years is the same focus on the executive layer of companies. ""Fifty-one per cent of the working population is female but that is not represented in the executive committees of companies. The message to all chief executives is: you've got to fix your executive committees and you've got to do it quickly."" The report found that only 65 of Britain's biggest firms met the 25% target but Lord Davies said he still supported a voluntary approach to the quota. He added: ""I think the very fact we've gone from 152 all-male boards to just 15 in a very short period of time shows the success we're having with a voluntary approach, so I think we should stick with a voluntary approach. ""It's working in the boardrooms but now needs to work in the top layers of companies."" Lord Davies said he would also liked to see more ""investor activism"" on the subject. ""I think one of the parties that was very slow to come to this was the shareholders - they, at the end of the day, own these companies. ""I think they've got the message now that getting the right gender diversity is about getting the right representation but it's also about getting the results. The more diverse your board is, the better the results."" The Government has already announced plans for a series of ""equality-boosting measures"", which would include a target to include women on the boards of every one of the country's top 350 companies."

Louis Dempsey was jailed for nine months for claiming he slipped over on a wet floor in an Asda store in Brighton, East Sussex. The unemployed 35-year-old is seen holding a basket and looking over his shoulder before jutting out one leg and falling on to his back. He lies flat on his back in apparent pain as shoppers walk past him. A woman and child then stop to check if he is hurt. Dempsey was convicted of fraud. Pic: Sussex Police Dempsey, from Mount Pleasant, Brighton, said he had slipped on a wet surface and tried to claim £11,000 from Asda for negligence. He claimed he was suffering from back and neck pain, headaches and emotional damage. Asda sent CCTV footage of the incident to his solicitor, but heard nothing for over a year, and his claim remained in place. The supermarket then contacted Sussex Police and Dempsey was convicted of a charge of fraud at Lewes Crown Court earlier this month. PC Lee Johnson said: ""Dempsey claimed he sustained the injuries when he slipped on a puddle of water which had been dripping from the store ceiling. ""But the whole CCTV episode shows him previously walking across that area and looking around, and others walking past with no problem at all."""

The Prime Minister was questioned by Jeremy Corbyn on whether low-paid families would still be out of pocket even taking into account a promise by the Chancellor to soften the blow of the cuts. Mr Cameron said only that the answers would come in the Chancellor's Autumn Statement at the end of November. The Labour leader used Prime Minister's Questions to repeatedly grill Mr Cameron over the controversial welfare reform that was voted down by the House of Lords earlier this week. :: PMQs As It Happened The introduction of the tax credit cuts, which had been due to hit in April with three million families losing around £1,300 a year, has now stalled until George Osborne can give further details on how the change will impact on some of the country's poorest workers. On Tuesday, the Chancellor announced he would ""lessen the impact"" of the cuts to ""help families"" and the details would be contained in the Autumn Statement. Mr Corbyn said: ""Following the events in the Lords on Monday evening and the rather belated acceptance from the Prime Minister of the result there, can you now guarantee to the House and the wider country that nobody will be worse off next year as a result of cuts to working tax credits?"" Mr Cameron replied: ""What I can guarantee is we remain committed to the vision of a high pay, low tax, lower welfare economy. ""We believe the way to ensure everyone is better off is keep growing our economy, keep inflation low, keep cutting people's taxes and introduce the national living wage."" The Prime Minister and the Chancellor have come under pressure from within their own party with a number of prominent figures, including London Mayor Boris Johnson, urging ""tweaks"" to limit the impact of the cuts. Mr Corbyn told Mr Cameron he had failed to answer six times and said there should be a ""cast iron guarantee"" for families affected by the tax credit changes. He said the tax credits debacle had meant the Prime Minister had ""lost the support of many people in this country who are actually quite sympathetic to his political project"". And he added: ""This is not a constitutional crisis, this is a crisis for three million families, three million families very worried about what is going to happen next April."" The Labour leader tried again with a question from a public sector worker called Karen but received jeers from the Conservative benches. Mr Cameron said it was a ""strange set of events"" when the House of Commons had voted in favour of the tax credit reform, leaving Labour reliant on the unelected House of Lords to fight the Government's changes. He joked that there was a new alliance of the ""unelected and the unelectable"". Downing Street later insisted that Mr Cameron had answered the Labour leader's questions."

And during a speech in London on Wednesday, he also warned that so-called Islamic State (IS) is planning ""mass casualty"" attacks on Britain. He described a ""three dimensional threat"" at home, overseas and online - with an increasing amount of MI5's casework linked to Syria and IS. ""It (IS) uses the full range of modern communications tools to spread its message of hate, and to inspire extremists, sometimes as young as their teens, to conduct attacks in whatever way they can."" Gallery: Islamic State: The Facts :: Terror Threat? Listen For The Sound Of Spades And he warned the threat posed by IS - also known as ISIL - ""shows no sign of abating"" after more than 750 British extremists travelled to Syria. Mr Parker also highlighted that al Qaeda groups in South Asia, the Arabian Peninsula and parts of Africa remain a threat. ""All of this means that the threat we are facing today is on a scale and at a tempo that I have not seen before in my career,"" he added. His remarks come days before the Government is expected to publish a draft of landmark legislation covering spies' activities in the digital era. And he insisted the security agencies need greater powers to keep the country safe. ""Today the conversations of our adversaries are happening on a bewildering array of devices and digital platforms, often provided by companies based overseas. ""Information gathered from the technology terrorists use, often in the same way as the rest of us, may sometimes be the only way to stop them.

""This work has enabled us to better understand events the night Madeleine McCann went missing and ensure every possible measure is being taken to find out what happened to her."" Madeleine was three years old when she vanished while on a family holiday in Portugal in May 2007. Her parents Gerry and Kate McCann were dining with friends near their rented holiday apartment in Praia da Luz at the time. Portuguese police abandoned their investigation after 15 months without establishing any clues to the mystery, and for three years there was no official search for Madeleine. With Home Office backing, Scotland Yard began a review of evidence in 2011 and then launched a full-scale investigation two years ago. The probe has cost millions of pounds and spanned several countries, but so far no arrests have been made. Police say more  than 60 ""persons of interest"" have been investigated, while 650 sex offenders have ""been considered"". Madeleine's parents say they ""fully understand"" why the police operation is being scaled back and remain hopeful there will be a breakthrough.

""Whilst we do not know what happened to Madeleine, we remain hopeful that she may still be found given the ongoing lines of inquiry,"" they said. Their daughter's disappearance triggered one of the most high-profile missing persons investigations in British history. In 2014, a team of around 30 officers and police staff travelled to the area to Praia da Luz to search a four acre site not far from where the McCanns had been staying. And earlier this year, British detectives contacted their Australian counterparts after a young girl's body was found beside a highway in remote South Australia. However local police ""totally excluded"" the possibility it could be Madeleine."

It comes a day after Barclays - which sacked chief executive Antony Jenkins earlier this year over subdued revenue and share performance - announced the appointment from December of new boss Jes Staley, a US banker who will receive an annual pay package of up to £8.2m. The latest figures included for the first-time the cost of implementing ring-fencing of its UK retail arm, which under new laws must be in place by 2019, and the setting up of a holding company for its US investment bank by mid-2016. Ring-fencing rules have been brought in following the financial crisis, when taxpayers had to spend billions bailing out the banks and keep the financial system going when they were brought to their knees by the risky so-called ""casino"" operations such as investment banking. Barclays revealed that structural reforms would cost it £100m this year and £400m in 2016, with another £500m to be spent on ring-fencing in 2017 and 2018. It prompted the bank to raise cost forecasts and cut its target on returns to investors for next year. Meanwhile, Barclays has set aside cash for the first time to compensate UK foreign exchange customers after an internal review of rates given on transactions between 2005 and 2012. Finance director Tushar Morzaria said: ""We didn't apply the most appropriate foreign exchange rate and we're looking to make that good."" He said that the sum of £290m set aside was ""prudent and sufficient"" but that work to identify issues was ""ongoing"". The bank also made a provision of £270m relating to the settlement of litigation of US mortgages that was announced this month."

2015-10-29,David Cameron has warned the House of Lords he will be reviewing the power wielded by peers in the wake of the double defeat on tax credit cuts.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151029152404/http://news.sky.com/story/1576861/what-now-for-the-house-of-lords,"David Cameron has warned the House of Lords he will be reviewing the power wielded by peers in the wake of the double defeat on tax credit cuts. But what does it all mean? We answer some of the key questions about the upper chamber. :: So the Lords didn't agree with the Commons, what's the problem? Isn't that their job? The House of Lords is supposed to hold the Government to account - a bit Well yes, and no. It is the job of peers in the upper chamber to scrutinise Government policy and to provide checks and balances. But there are rules about what they can tinker with. We say rules but actually we mean conventions, which are more flexible than rules. Like moveable goalposts. :: And by voting against tax credits they broke a rule? They broke a convention – or at least that's what the Government says. There is a convention that dates back to the 17th century and says the House of Commons has the final say on financial matters. Since 1911, the House of Lords has not been allowed to overturn a Commons finance vote. David Cameron says the vote delaying tax credit cuts and demanding alterations to the way they are administered broke the convention. But it's a grey area. The cuts were not part of the Finance Bill because they were not in the Conservative manifesto – they were introduced in July's Budget. It means the Government has tried to get it through the House of Lords using a ""statutory instrument"" - not primary finance legislation. Peers say that meant they could vote against it - though do admit it does relate to the financial running of the country. :: What exactly is a statutory instrument? Know your instruments It's like a big brass trumpet ... Actually it's nothing like that. A statutory instrument allows ministers to push reforms through without having to include them in a bill. There is a feeling statutory instruments get less scrutiny than a bill. The Lords have killed off five statutory instruments supported by the Government since 1945 – in 1968, twice in 2000, 2007 and 2012. :: What is the problem with the Lords overturning Commons decisions? The ""elected"" House of Commons The upper chamber is unelected and therefore does not reflect the will of the people in the way the Commons does. In this case, peers have argued that MPs were not reflecting the will of the people because the Conservatives refused to spell out the details of the £12bn welfare cuts they proposed before the election.  David Cameron was pressed on it. Repeatedly. In fact in a Question Time special he said that child tax credits would not fall. Peers say in this case, therefore, the Lords is more reflective of the public view than the Government – a recent Sky Data poll showed half the public opposed the cuts, only 31% supported them. And remember the Lords is there to hold the Government to account. It inflicted 99 defeats on the Coalition government. :: What is the Government going to do about it? Peers stopped from meddling with the nation's finances? Calls for House of Lords reform have been numerous – there are 826 peers compared to 650 elected MPs, which seems an extraordinary expense. But, until now, Mr Cameron has had little appetite for tackling the problem. (He forced Nick Clegg to shelve plans to reform the upper chamber in 2012). Actually, he has created peers at a faster rate than any other Prime Minister since life peerages began in 1958. In the wake of the tax credit cuts vote though, Mr Cameron has promised/threatened a ""rapid review"" of powers. He will basically look at how the rules/conventions can be tightened to make very sure the Lords cannot monkey with finance matters again. He has also threatened to flood the Lords with Conservative peers – the reason the Government was dished defeat was because there is not a Tory majority in the upper chamber. This would be unpopular though. :: Is he really going to pick a fight with the Lords? Ding, ding It is unlikely the PM, or the Chancellor, has much of an appetite for a proper scrap. There are suggestions the ""rapid review"" threat is a distraction from the main event – Mr Osborne and what he's going to do about tax credits. (To be revealed in the Autumn Statement at the end of November). There is a deep irony that the Lords, associated with privilege and wealth as it is, has become the champion of the working people and that it is a Conservative PM who has now has the job of dealing with peers. Watch this space."
2015-10-29,"Handouts of £46m of public money to Kids Company have been branded ""unbelievable"" by an MP after concerns were raised by officials about how the charity was being run.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151029152404/http://news.sky.com/story/1577942/kids-company-given-46m-despite-concerns,"By Jon Craig, Chief Political Correspondent Handouts of £46m of public money to Kids Company have been branded ""unbelievable"" by an MP after concerns were raised by officials about how the charity was being run. The now collapsed group, led by high-profile founder Camila Batmanghelidjh, relied on taxpayer funding and issued public warnings about its future whenever there were concerns about the continued supply of Government money. Now, after a damning report by the National Audit Office, civil servants responsible for some of the funding decisions will be questioned by the powerful Commons Public Accounts Committee next Monday. ""It is unbelievable that over 13 years taxpayers' money has been given to Kids Company with little focus on what it was actually achieving for the children it was supporting,"" said committee chair Meg Hillier. ""Government repeatedly raised concerns about Kids Company's finances but little action was taken. ""Despite this, government gave it further grants - funded by the taxpayer. ""Government departments have questions to answer about how they held the charity to account for spending taxpayers' hard earned money."" The NAO's report found Kids Company had received public funding for at least 15 years, with at least £42m in central government grants - including £28m from the Department for Education and its predecessors - around £2m from councils and £2m of lottery money. The report found despite the huge sums of public money being handed to the charity, until 2013 the government relied heavily on Kid's Company's self-assessments to monitor its performance. ""The DfE oversaw the grant funding of Kids Company until summer 2013 but has limited records of monitoring activities before 2011,"" the report said. In 2008 and 2011, Kids Company received larger grants than any other charity from DfE grant programmes, the NAO found. The investigation by the spending watchdog followed the award of £3m to the charity in June after ministers overruled official warnings from the senior Cabinet Office civil servant that it would not represent value for money. The money was paid on 30 July, but the same day officials learned the Metropolitan Police was investigating the charity over allegations of physical and sexual abuse. Following the announcement of the police inquiry, the trustees decided to close Kids Company in August as they were no longer confident they could secure future income. On 3 August, the Cabinet Office terminated the grant agreement and requested repayment of £2.1m. The NAO report said: ""The concerns raised by the Cabinet Office in 2015 were not new. ""Officials repeatedly expressed concerns about Kids Company, but the Government continued to respond to the charity's requests for funding. ""As far back as 2002, government records show officials were concerned about the charity's cash flow and financial sustainability. ""Officials also noted at that time that other organisations appeared to offer better value for money. ""Briefings to ministers in 2002, 2005, 2007, 2010, 2012 and 2015 show that officials accepted Kids Company's assertions that it would become insolvent without government grant funding."" Despite the charity's claims that it worked with up to 36,000 youngsters and their family members, when it closed the details of only around 1,900 cases were passed to local authorities in London and Bristol. But responding to the NAO report, a Cabinet Office spokesperson said: ""Since 2002, successive governments have provided financial assistance to the charity to help it deliver services for vulnerable young people. ""The welfare of the young people has always and continues to be our top priority, and we will continue to work with local authorities, charities and youth clubs in Lambeth, Southwark, Camden and Bristol to support young people with the services they need."""
