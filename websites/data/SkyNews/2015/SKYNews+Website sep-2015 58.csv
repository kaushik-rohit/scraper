2015-09-05,The suffering of those affected by the refugee crisis gripping Europe has galvanised tens of thousands of Britons into raising funds and gathering supplies to help the humanitarian relief effort.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150905153905/http://news.sky.com/story/1547105/britons-step-in-to-help-ease-refugee-suffering,"The suffering of those affected by the refugee crisis gripping Europe has galvanised tens of thousands of Britons into raising funds and gathering supplies to help the humanitarian relief effort. People across the UK have come together to sign petitions, collect food and clothing, donate money, and offer up their homes to people displaced by conflict in the Middle East and Africa. A convoy of around 20 cars has taken £6,000 worth of vital supplies of food, clothing and shelter to a camp in Calais, France, today. Weyman Bennett, joint secretary of organisers Stand Up To Racism, told Sky News: ""I believe as human beings we should offer support to everybody else. Britain has a long tradition of welcoming people. ""Let's keep that tradition alive and let's make sure that all those people are welcome into Britain as they have been in Germany."" The Refugees Welcome campaign Sky's Richard Suchet, who is travelling with the group, said the manager of a donations centre in the French port had told him British people were the most generous. The Prime Minister has bowed to intensifying political pressure and announced that Britain would take ""thousands more"" refugees from the camps in countries around Syria. George Osborne echoed David Cameron's remarks, but warned Britain also needed to do more to tackle the causes of migration by defeating smuggling gangs, boosting aid and tackling conflict in Syria. The Chancellor also described the UK as ""one of the founders of the asylum system"". More than 40 local councils have responded to an appeal to offer sanctuary to the refugees. Labour leadership contender Yvette Cooper - who earlier this week called for the UK to take 10,000 refugees - said local authorities around the country had shown a ""rising sense of moral purpose"". The shadow home secretary said that within 24 hours of her asking councils in England, Scotland and Wales asking if they would be prepared to help in providing places for refugees, more than 40 had written back offering support. But council leaders have warned that there is a limit to how much they are able to do without more government support. David Simmonds, of the Local Government Association, described the offers by some people to take in refugee families as ""pie in the sky"". The reality is that it costs many millions to house and support asylum seekers while their applications are being processed, he said, with many taking years to decide. Mr Simmonds said: ""The cost of providing the services we would need to provide is clearly very significant. Generous offers are very good, but if it takes several years to process somebody's asylum application that person is not allowed to work. ""Are those people who are opening those homes genuinely willing to have a stranger from a war-torn country living in their house potentially for three or four years while a decision is made about whether they will be allowed to stay?"" Some football fans in London said they planned to show their support by making donations and waving ""#RefugeesWelcome"" banners at upcoming matches. Charities say they have received hundreds of thousands of pounds in donations from members of the public. Save The Children raised more than £500,000 in 24 hours with the support of several authors, including Patrick Ness and David Nicholls. The number of people signing a petition calling on the UK government to accept more refugees, meanwhile, has passed 400,000. Members of the Jewish community are also donating to the World Jewish Relief's Refugee Crisis Appeal. Paul Anticoni, World Jewish Relief chief executive, said: ""Many Jews wouldn't be here today without our ancestors finding shelter as refugees. Elsewhere, Finland's Prime Minister said he would be giving up his home to refugees who he expects to move in by the start of the year."

It happened at around lunchtime on Friday at St David's Barracks in Bicester. Sky News understands the soldier's own weapon was fired, although the exact cause has not yet been determined. The man, believed to have been aged in his 20s, held the rank of Private. The MoD confirmed the shooting did not take place during exercises and that it involved one man. A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said police and ambulance services were called at 11.52am where they found the man in a critical condition. ""Despite attempts to resuscitate the man he sadly died at the scene. ""The death, which is currently being investigated by Thames Valley Police, is not believed, at this stage, to be suspicious nor involve a third party."" An MoD spokesman said an investigation has been launched but would not comment further. The soldier's family have been informed."
2015-09-05,A passenger has been tackled by cabin crew after starting two small fires on board a holiday jet.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150905153905/http://news.sky.com/story/1546810/passenger-starts-fires-on-holiday-jet-to-egypt,"A passenger has been tackled by cabin crew after starting two small fires on board a holiday jet. Police have launched an investigation after the incidents on a Monarch service from Birmingham Airport to Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt. Staff quickly contained and extinguished the fires during Thursday's flight, and no-one was hurt. However the plane was left unserviceable, leaving holidaymakers due to fly back to Birmingham stranded. One delayed passenger told the Birmingham Mail: ""The plane was unserviceable because a man set fire to onboard toilets deliberately while also smoking and abusing the cabin crew, terrifying crew and passengers."" They added that the passenger who set the fires was escorted away, but ""showed no remorse and verbally abused the passengers whose flight was cancelled"". A spokesman for West Midlands Police said: ""Officers from the Airport Policing Unit continue to investigate the circumstances around the incidents. ""At present no arrests have been made but our inquiries are still ongoing."" Monarch Airlines said police were on hand when flight ZB472 - an Airbus A321 with 208 passengers and crew on board - landed in Egypt. A statement said: ""UK authorities have been notified and are dealing with the matter. As the alleged incident is the subject of a police investigation, we are not in a position to comment further."" No arrests have been made."
2015-09-05,Hugo Boss has been fined £1.2m for health and safety breaches after the death of a four-year-old boy at one of its stores.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150905153905/http://news.sky.com/story/1546903/hugo-boss-fined-1-2m-over-boys-shop-death,"Hugo Boss has been fined £1.2m for health and safety breaches after the death of a four-year-old boy at one of its stores. An 18-stone (114kg) changing room mirror, which had been balanced upright like a ""domino piece"", fell on Austen Harrison at the company's Bicester Village outlet in June 2013. Austen was taken to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford with severe head injuries, but died four days later after suffering irreversible brain damage. An inquest concluded the 7ft mirror should have been fixed to a wall, with coroner Darren Salter describing it as ""an accident waiting to happen"". The designer goods retailer admitted breaches of health and safety laws. The youngster suffered irreversible brain damage and died in hospital In sentencing the company, Oxford Crown Court Judge Peter Ross said Hugo Boss had a ""corporate responsibility"" - and he wanted to ensure the issue went to the ""very top of the company"". He said it ""would have been obvious to the untrained eye"" that the mirror posed a risk, adding that it was ""nothing short of a miracle"" that it had not happened sooner. There had been numerous ""near misses"" with mirrors at other stores nationwide, the judge added. After several mirrors fell at stores in London during 2009, the company's senior staff and store managers had been given health and safety training which specifically highlighted this issue. But according to the judge, the company's Bicester Village store was hurriedly opened in 2012, which led to ""a lack of planning"" - and instructions for the mirror were ""ill-defined and not followed through"". Following the sentencing, a representative for the boy's mother read a statement on her behalf. ""I would like to thank the coroner, Judge Ross and Mr Hake of Hugo Boss for their sensitivity and genuine care,"" it said. ""Austen's greatest pleasure in life was to help others. In his memory I invite you to help someone, no matter how small or large the deed, to assist Austen in creating a friendlier world. ""My love extends to each one of you for doing this."" At the time of the incident, Hugo Boss released a statement promising to co-operate with authorities as they investigated what happened. After the ruling, a spokesman said: ""The company has since done everything it can to prevent such a tragedy from reoccurring. We wish to make clear that health and safety is an integral part of our business, and a priority at every level of the organisation. ""Over the last two years, our thoughts and sympathies have been first and foremost with Austen's parents. ""We know, however, that there are no words to alleviate in any way the suffering caused to the family, and for that we remain profoundly sorry."" The judge acknowledged that Hugo Boss UK had taken immediate responsibility for the accident which claimed Austen's life, but concluded there had been a systematic failure with regard to health and safety."
2015-09-05,"The Labour Party must be congratulated by those of us who believe that live debates, especially on television, are the best way of connecting political decisions to the mass of the people on whose behalf those decisions are being taken.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150905153905/http://news.sky.com/story/1546472/corbynmania-rules-mp-wins-over-tv-audience,"The Labour Party must be congratulated by those of us who believe that live debates, especially on television, are the best way of connecting political decisions to the mass of the people on whose behalf those decisions are being taken. After the breakthrough of the Leaders' Debates in 2010, the 2015 General Election was a severe disappointment. Led by the Conservatives, the main parties did all they could to avoid, or failing that to neutralise, any live encounters on air. But the would-be leaders of the Labour Party will have taken part in some 30 live hustings as their long post-election campaign draws to a close. Only a handful of those have been on television - and last night's Labour's Future: The Final Debate on Sky News was the last such encounter before the winner is declared on 12 September. The Sky debate took place in perhaps the most stable Labour heartland in the UK. Tony Blair and his ministerial team, from Mo Mowlam to Peter Mandelson, made their political base in the North East. So the Sky News debate on Tyneside before an audience of at least 80% party sympathisers was a real opportunity to test the political mood away from any Westminster Bubble. All the candidates for the leadership - Jeremy Corbyn, Liz Kendall, Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham - knew they could expect a respectful hearing from a loyal and pragmatic audience. But even though the North East was a cradle for New Labour in the last century, it was soon clear that it is no exception from the national mood of the party in 2015. Corbynmania has reached Gateshead as well. Mr Corbyn, the longstanding left-wing rebel MP, basked in by far the longest bursts of applause. His support was there whether he stood by his opposition to austerity economics or hinted at compromise with his opponents over the question of Britain's continued membership of the UN Security Council. Approval ratings for Mr Corbyn were just as high among the debate's TV audience at home, with more than 80% declaring the bearded Islington North MP the winner. Already, at least two of his rivals, Ms Cooper and Mr Burnham, seem to be trimming their earlier rejection of joining Mr Corbyn's team if he is elected leader next week. This, even though he was the only candidate to categorically rule out voting in favour of extending Britain's involvement in the bombing of Islamic State to include territory in Syria. In the section of the debate where we asked the candidates to challenge each other directly, there was a dramatic standoff over the economy between Mr Corbyn and Ms Cooper. Ms Cooper argued that quantitative easing for investment in infrastructure amounted to printing money the country does not have. Mr Corbyn retorted that the public finance initiatives under the last Labour government were expensive as well. This may not have answered the question but it won him applause and cheers. It is still possible that Mr Corbyn will not win this leadership election. Unless he can get close to an outright win above 50% on the first round, it seems unlikely he will get enough transfer votes as other candidates are eliminated. But after the final debate he remains the firm favourite, in spite of, or perhaps because of, the three decades he has spent as a rebel MP in Labour ranks."

Zamual Mallinson was investigated by the RSPCA after boasting on Facebook that he had trained his dogs to fight badgers and foxes. The 24-year-old's phone was seized during the search, and this was where the distressing footage of the wild rabbit was found. In the clip, Mallinson is seen quietly approaching the animal from behind, before kicking the it so hard that it lands in a bush several metres away. He and a friend are then heard laughing in the background. It is not known if the rabbit survived. Zamual Mallinson also trained dogs to fight badgers and foxes. Pic: RSPCA Following a three-day trial at Lincoln Magistrates' Court, Mallinson was found guilty of three animal welfare offences. As part of the sentence, he has been banned from keeping dogs for 10 years and will need to complete 140 hours of unpaid work. The judge also gave Mallinson a 12-week sentence, suspended for a year. Ian Briggs, the RSPCA's chief inspector, said the district judge was ""clearly unimpressed"" by Mallinson's behaviour. He explained: ""The footage we discovered on his mobile phone, of him deliberately and unashamedly kicking a wild rabbit, shows his contempt for animals. ""By stopping him from keeping dogs for the next 10 years, we hope it will prevent cruelty to other animals that could otherwise have caused pain and suffering purely for the sickening entertainment of this man."""

Police say the two-year-old boy was found neglected and nearly naked at a mechanic's workshop. Neighbour Lory Escudero, who lives in the city of Arica, called police on Thursday when she noticed the child being breastfed by her dog, Reina. ""We have our dog who is there and she's pregnant,"" she said. ""The hungry boy suckled on the dog's teats for milk. ""Everyone that is here, we're all parents and if you saw what we saw from my position as a woman, as a mother, it was terrible."" The boy was taken to hospital where he was treated for malnutrition, skin infections and hair lice. His mother attended the hospital - but was inebriated, police said. The incident happened in an impoverished area of Arica where thousands of Peruvians and Bolivians arrive in search of work. A family court hearing on 22 September will determine who will care for the child."
2015-09-05,"Passengers on one of the Britain's busiest railway lines had to deal with delays due to a signalling problem said to have been caused by cable theft ""vandalism"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150905153905/http://news.sky.com/story/1547133/rail-passengers-delayed-after-cable-vandalism,"Passengers on one of the Britain's busiest railway lines had to deal with delays due to a signalling problem said to have been caused by cable theft ""vandalism"". People travelling on the Virgin Trains East Coast main line faced delays for up to an hour on Friday. They were told that the disruption was caused after an incident of cable theft at Darlington which in turn caused signalling problems. Virgin Trains said in a statement: ""A signalling problem at Darlington has been causing major disruption to journeys through the station this evening. ""Following an assessment by Network Rail, it was discovered that the signalling problem had been caused by vandalism."" Some services were replaced by buses, while other passengers faced delays of up to 60 minutes even when the problem had been fixed. Anyone delayed by more than 30 minutes can apply for compensation, Virgin said. The cost to the rail industry of cable thefts has fallen in recent years, following legislative changes through the Scrap Metal Dealers Act of 2013. There were 845 cases of cable theft on the railways, costing the industry £12m and resulting in 344,000 minutes of delays to services in 2011 and 2012. Those figures had reduced in 2013 and 2014 to 179 cases, costing £2.5m and resulting in 68,000 delay minutes."
2015-09-05,Number 10 insists that the UK strategy for dealing with the humanitarian refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has not changed - but it has.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150905153905/http://news.sky.com/story/1546915/pm-in-referendum-and-refugee-balancing-act,"Number 10 insists that the UK strategy for dealing with the humanitarian refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has not changed - but it has. How much the strategy has changed will be revealed within the detail of proposals to take in ""thousands more"" Syrian refugees.  The plans will be ready next week, but they clearly are a change in direction from the Prime Minister's remarks as late as Wednesday, when he said an answer to the crisis could not be achieved ""simply by taking more and more refugees"". In June, Mr Cameron had suggested there would be ""a few hundred more"" places on the Syria Vulnerable Persons programme, which has relocated 216 people to the UK since last year. Is this the result of one tragic picture of a drowned three-year-old? Indirectly, yes. The PM does not lead the charge on issues like this. The PM manages and tends - and on delicate issue such as this, waits for others to take the lead. But the crisis has become palpably worse, as public, media and political opinion has, for now, appeared to turn on a sixpence. Yvette Cooper's unexpected Labour leadership intervention - where she suggested 10,000 refugees could be rehomed in a joint effort between 1,000 councils, cities and towns - has had an impact on the political mood music. The SNP, all four Labour candidates, charities, the newspapers and concerned Conservative backbenchers are a formidable coalition to ignore. Mr Cameron's answer here has not changed: the actual solution to this problem lies in a political and diplomatic solution in Syria. He believes Britain has been very generous in supplying aid to local camps, and that Syrian migration will not solve the issue. But an alternative solution has not come and seems far off, so Britain will do more. There is a great political danger here. Very high up is the toxic connection with Europe and the European Union referendum. UKIP's ascent, and its four million votes, can be dated back to Nigel Farage's connection of the EU with immigration after Romanians and Bulgarians were permitted to travel across the EU in January 2014. Mr Cameron's strategy has been to try to break that link. If the current crisis is seen as an EU issue, then the link strengthens in the immediate run up to the EU referendum. That is Nigel Farage's stated strategy. And Farage, who in 2013 almost led calls for the UK to offer refuge to more Syrians, has now has gone cold on the issue - suggesting this ""biblical exodus"" means that the concept of ""refugees"" should be redefined. So, the ""thousands more"" will come direct from camps in Syria. That approach is consistent with not wanting to increase the ""pull factors"" for illegal migration into the EU. There can be no question of signing up to the EU quotas pushed by Italy, France and Germany, and vehemently argued over at the last EU summit. Under that arrangement, the UK would have been expected to host 30,000 refugees, but there is an opt-out. Above all, the government will try to make this an issue of domestic, not European policy. The flipside though, is Britain will not appear to be pulling its weight, at a time when the PM needs diplomatic capital for his renegotiation. For all the petitions, hashtags and newspaper headlines, Mr Cameron also knows that there is also a sizeable portion of the British public - perhaps as many as those who want more refugees in the UK - who do not believe this is Britain's responsibility. The connection between this crisis and how they might vote in the EU referendum cannot be ignored."
2015-09-05,Thousands of patients are going to miss out on life-extending drugs – after NHS England announced it was removing 16 medicines from the Cancer Drugs Fund.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150905153905/http://news.sky.com/story/1547028/life-extending-drugs-cut-from-nhs-cancer-fund,"Thousands of patients are going to miss out on life-extending drugs – after NHS England announced it was removing 16 medicines from the Cancer Drugs Fund. Some of the delisted drugs were being used in treatments for bowel cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, pancreatic cancer and leukaemia. The move follows concerns that the Cancer Drugs Fund has continually overspent on its annual budget – despite a recent increase from £200m to £340m a year. Manufacturers of nine of the drugs affected have been given the opportunity to drop the prices charged to the NHS, to ensure new patients can still get access. Cancer patients who have already begun receiving the delisted drugs through the fund will not be affected by the decision. However, the Rarer Cancers Foundation has described the cost-cutting measure as ""a hammer blow to many thousands of desperately ill cancer patients"". It said more than 5,500 people will lose the opportunity to the take life-extending medicines – which include Abraxane for pancreatic cancer, and Avastin for breast, bowel and cervical cancer. The charity's chief executive, Andrew Wilson, also claimed there will be ""no action to make available the newest game-changing drugs"". According to NHS England's current projections, expenditure on the Cancer Drugs Fund would have exceeded £410m this year without the changes – an overspend of approximately £70m. It also means the number of medicines provided by the fund has been decreased by more than 50% - to just 15. Professor Peter Clark, an oncologist who is the chairman of the Cancer Drugs Fund, said: ""There is no escaping the fact that we face a difficult set of choices, but it is our duty to ensure we get maximum value from every penny available on behalf of patients. ""We must ensure we invest in those treatments that offer the most benefit, based on rigorous evidence-based clinical analysis and an assessment of the cost of those treatments."" Roche manufactures Kadcyla, one of the delisted drugs which costs an average of £5,900 per patient each month. Its medical director claimed NHS England has been offered £15m in savings on the price it pays for Roche medicines in the Cancer Drug Fund ""to protect all patients at risk of losing access"". According to the Department of Health, more than 72,000 people have accessed cancer medicines using the fund since its introduction."

The UKIP leader made the suggestion as he kicked off his party's EU referendum campaign. In an article in The Daily Telegraph, Mr Farage invited Mr Corbyn to share a platform with him at any of the events on his nationwide tour between now and the referendum, which is set to take place before the end of 2017. Mr Farage said: ""I would be delighted to hear him, as a genuinely radical voice on the Left, making his critique of the EU and why we shouldn't be scared of leaving. ""This has absolutely nothing to do with party politics, but is about the good of the nation and the people within it, so that we can forge ahead in the world with a Britain unconstrained by the EU's meddling agenda."" Later, in an LBC radio phone-in, Mr Farage said the impact of Mr Corbyn's candidacy showed the political Left were ""waking up to what the EU is"". Mr Farage also restated his determination to play a key role in the national vote, dismissing claims he could harm the chances of a victory for the ""No"" campaign. Research by the polling company Survation for the British Future think-tank has suggested Mr Farage's focus on immigration could turn away floating voters. But Mr Farage said his name was not mentioned in the polling, and accused ""soft Conservative Eurosceptics"" of trying to damage him. He said: ""You have to understand there are certain people in Westminster who are not happy that I am launching this nationwide tour today."" ""Some of the rather posher set. ""There are some sort of soft Conservative Eurosceptics who think they should be in charge of the campaign and they can manage it all from a few streets in Westminster. ""They have been trying since May to say 'Nigel is divisive and Nigel is this and Nigel is that' ... my name isn't even mentioned in the opinion poll. ""It was taken during the General Election at a moment when UKIP was being demonised and it is being dragged out to coincide with our launch."" When asked if he was a ""Marmite"" politician, Mr Farage replied: ""I don't think that's right. I have got an opinion. ""Some people will agree with it and some people will disagree with it. ""At least they know what I stand for."" Mr Farage said he thought Mr Corbyn, a veteran left-wing MP who has stunned the political establishment with his rise from rank outsider to hot favourite in the Labour ballot, was similar to him because they both appealed to those outside the ""Westminster village"". ""Here is a bloke who stands up and says what he believes,"" Mr Farage said. ""I don't believe in very much of it. ""However, I noticed last night on that final debate held on Sky that when the EU question came up he was very critical. ""I think the Left of British politics is waking up to what the EU is. Mr Farage added: ""I hope Corbyn wins, because I think under him there will be a proper debate on the Left of British politics in this referendum on what the EU is."""

Mick Deane, who had worked at the channel for 15 years, died covering the protests in Egypt on 14 August 2013. The inquest heard how he had been filming where members of the Muslim Brotherhood were camped in protests against the government and military. He had been gathering footage of a group of women reading the Koran, when he was shot in the chest. Sky News' security manager Craig Summers, 54, was with Mr Deane at the time. He told the inquest at Southwark Coroner's Court in London: ""I noticed a row of ladies sat down reading the Koran and decided it would be good to get some GVs (general views). ""I walked back to get Mr Deane and said we needed to get some pictures of the general area, and he came with me to the stage. ""The next thing I knew he turned around and said to me 'I have been shot'. ""I had no idea which direction (the bullet came from). Mr Summers took the injured cameraman to a nearby field hospital where first aid was given. Eventually Mr Deane got to a hospital but died a short time later. Mr Summers added that he heard no rounds of fire before, during or after the incident. ""I have no idea who shot him. I don't know where the shot came from,"" he said. ""I believe it was obviously government forces because they were the only ones in the area there with sniper rifles."" The coroner, Dr Lorna Tagliavini, ruled out recording unlawful killing because doubt still remained whether the shot was intended for Mr Deane. Dr Tagliavini, who returned a narrative conclusion, said: ""Mr Deane was shot and fatally wounded while carrying out his employment duties as a cameraman in Cairo. ""I am satisfied he died as a result of a gunshot wound."" The inquest heard the crew was not wearing protective kit as the Egyptian authorities had confiscated it at the airport. ""At the time of his death he was not wearing any protective equipment, high-vis jacket, or identifying equipment singling him out as a cameraman from the media"", said Dr Tagliavini. ""I found that he was attending an area known to either be an area where trouble had occurred or was about to occur, given the political situation at the time. ""While it strongly appears he was singled out, I can't rule out entirely that this was either a wayward shot that might have been aimed at a building that hit him. ""I have no evidence to assist as to the trajectory or the type of bullet or weapon used, and that puts me in some difficulty. ""I have no evidence one way or the other whether that the shot was intended for him or intended to kill him. ""There is a possibility that it was only intended to frighten him, and it could be that the shooter was unfortunately a poor shot."" Mr Deane, who was born in Hanover, Germany, leaves behind a wife and two sons. After the inquest, Head of Sky News John Ryley said: ""Mick was a very valued colleague and a dear friend to many of us here at Sky. We miss him. ""Our thoughts are with his family. Mick was one of those brave cameramen willing to go to dangerous parts of the world. ""I pay tribute to his professionalism and his courage as a cameraman."" The coroner also placed on record her condolences to Mr Deane's family and his colleagues."

Mary Shipstone, also known as Maryam Alromisse, was gunned down as she returned from school after her first music lesson, and was clutching a new violin. She was standing next to her mother, Lyndsey Shipstone, who was unlocking the front door of their house in Northiam in East Sussex at the time. After the shooting, Alromisse turned the gun on himself. His body was found in the back of a car he had parked outside their ""safe house"". Neighbours tried to revive Mary while waiting for the emergency services. She died of her injuries in hospital. Mrs Shipstone and her daughter had moved out of the home they had shared with the 46-year-old amid claims he had turned abusive. Hastings Coroner's Court heard how Alromisse had hired a private detective to try and find their new address - but the investigator withdrew his services because he was concerned the father would try and abduct his daughter. On the day of Mary's murder on 11 September last year, Alromisse had hired a rental car and insisted to staff that it needed to be a car with tinted windows. At the hearing, Coroner Alan Craze concluded Mary was unlawfully killed, and recorded her father's death as a suicide. ""It was not in any way spontaneous. It was pre-meditated over a long period of time,"" he added. During the inquest, Mrs Shipstone described the day of the shooting, and said Mary was ""very happy and excited"" about her eighth birthday, which was a week away. She told the court: ""I was putting my key in the door, and I spoke to Mary, saying she'd like what I had done to her room, and that's the last thing I said to her. ""There was a terrific sound behind me like someone had burst a balloon. ""I turned around and the first thing I saw was Mary on the ground - her legs were crumpled behind her."" The mother said she soon realised her ex-partner had shot their daughter, as she could see his emotionless face in the backseat of a nearby Toyota. Mrs Shipstone said she was unsure why Alromisse would have wanted to kill Mary, describing it as ""such an extreme thing to do"". She went on: ""He had the opportunity to shoot me as well, but he chose not to do it, and I was the one he supposedly hated the most. ""It's an act of revenge, really. It's got be. If he really loved her, he would never have inflicted that on her. ""He's left me bereft of a daughter."""

The aid campaigner and singer said he felt sick at seeing images of three-year-old Syrian Aylan Kurdi's body being washed up on a Turkish beach. ""I look at it with profound shame and a monstrous betrayal of who we are and what we wish to be,"" he told RTÉ Radio One in Ireland. ""We are in a moment currently now that will be discussed and impacted on in 300 years’ time."" He said he would open the doors to his family home as a personal response to the growing refugee crisis. ""I'm prepared - I'm lucky, I've a place in Kent and a flat in London - me and (partner) Jeanne would be prepared to take three families immediately in our place in Kent and a family in our flat in London, immediately, and put them up until such time as they can get going and get a purchase on their future."" The dean of York Minster, the Very Reverend Vivienne Faull, has also offered to house a refugee family and has urged the government to offer more support to those fleeing war. ""I understand Britain is providing considerable help through its overseas aid budget but it is now clear that this is not providing an adequate solution and we need to do more to help those in desperate need,"" she said.  Geldof criticised the limited response from governments to date and said he decided to put his money where his mouth is. ""I've known, you've known, and everyone listening has known that the b******s we talk about, our values, are complete nonsense,"" he said. ""Once it comes home to roost we deny those values, we betray ourselves, but those values are correct, and it happens time and time again. ""So we are better than this, we genuinely are. ""All of this is happening now. We must have the politics and the humanity to deal with it. It makes me sick and a concert won't do it,"" he added. Both Geldof and Dean Faull made the comments before the UK Prime Minister confirmed that Britain would accept “thousands more” Syrian refugees."

Choudary 48, has been on remand at Belmarsh high security prison in London since being charged on 5 August. The East London-based activist appeared by video link at an Old Bailey hearing before Judge Mr Justice Saunders. It is alleged that Choudary committed an offence related to Islamic State's status as a ""proscribed terrorist organisation"" - support for the group is banned in the UK. He is charged with Mohammed Rahman, 32, of Whitechapel, east London, who is also accused of inviting support for IS. Rahman, who has also been on remand since his arrest, appeared alongside Choudary at the same hearing and was also granted bail. The charges both men face relate to their alleged activities between 29 June 2014 and 6 March this year. The prosecution claims Choudary and Rahman publicised support for IS and leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi through lectures published online. Section 12 of the Terrorism Act 2000 states that a person commits an offence if they invite ""support for a proscribed organisation, and the support is not, or is not restricted to, the provision of money or other property"". The Home Office moved to ban Islamic State, which it calls Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in June last year. The two men are due to stand trial at the Old Bailey in January next year."

The records of service men, women and civilians who were taken captive have been digitised and put onto the internet to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of the war and the liberation of the Far East Prisoner of War camps. The documents, registers and photographs were previously available only at The National Archives in Kew making it complicated for people to find out about their relatives and loved ones, especially without knowing which prisoner of war camp they were held at. Dr Bill Frankland was among the first to find his prisoner records online One veteran who has already discovered his own documentation is Dr Bill Frankland MBE who was a prisoner of war between 1942 and 1945. The 103-year-old was held at the notorious Changi Prison in Singapore, but only recently shared his personal story. Like many veterans, Dr Frankland struggled to open up about his time as a POW: ""When I was a prisoner of war, it was very miserable,"" he said. ""Why should I think about a time when I was perhaps, not happy? I was alive and happy that I was alive. I decided I wouldn't talk to my wife about it or my children at all."" Now the veteran, who is an award-winning immunologist, is more open about his time as a doctor in the camp and says publishing the records is a good things for families. ""I'm over a hundred, and l'm lucky as I can still talk about it but most people who had grandfathers or fathers who've died as prisoners of war, they would very much want to know [about them],"" he said. The collection covers the period 1939 -1945 and consists of documents from Japanese and German prisoner of war camps, including the Stalag III prison known for the 'The Great Escape' attempt. The records contain the names, ranks and locations of prisoners of war, along with the length of time spent in camps, the number of survivors, details of escapees and the nationalities of prisoners. Paul Nixon, from the Find My Past website, says it's taken more than seven months to get the records online. ""It's a huge amount of information,"" he said. ""The records would have been collated after the Second World War and would have gone to the war office and they've subsequently gone to the National Archives so you could view them there but it's just very difficult to find them."" The website is allowing people to search through the records but will charge a fee to look at the results."

John Collins, 74, from Islington, north London, Daniel Jones, 58, from Enfield, north London, Terry Perkins, 67, from Enfield, north London and Brian Reader, 76, from Dartford, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to burgle between January 1 and April 7. They appeared at Woolwich Crown Court in southeast London, supported by friends and family in the public gallery. The men will be sentenced at a date still to be confirmed. All four also faced a charge of conspiracy to convert or transfer criminal property, namely a quantity of jewellery and other items between April 1 and May 19, but in light of their guilty pleas in relation to the conspiracy to burgle, Philip Evans, prosecuting, said the Crown would not be pursuing the charge.

They also pleaded not guilty to a laundering offence and are due to stand trial on November 16 this year. Paul Reader, 50, of Dartford Road, Dartford, and Carl Wood, 58, of Elderbeck Close, Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, are yet to enter pleas. All nine men appeared in custody and were accompanied in the dock by 13 security guards. The raid over the Easter weekend saw a gang break into the vault in London's diamond district after using a drill to bore a huge hole in the wall. The Metropolitan Police faced criticism for its handling of the case and apologised for not following procedures when a security firm called about an intruder alert at the premises on Good Friday."

The Lost City Of Z has been shooting on land near Ballygally for the past few months but it seems locals are less than happy. Residents have shared photos of explosions and smoke billowing across the countryside. Jason McKillion told the Larne Times that animals had been ""terrified"" by the noise. ""It started last Monday with bangs, gunfire and small explosions. Then on Tuesday the bigger explosions started,"" he said. ""The explosions shook the house and windows and the boom echoed through the glen. ""My neighbour’s horses were in the field near the film set and they went spare, trying to jump the ditches."" He said cows and chickens had also been affected by the noise. Mr McKillion said they welcomed the production team filming on location there but would have appreciated some communication about the disturbances. ""There wasn’t a single notification about this, which would have been common courtesy,"" he said. ""I support companies filming here, but they need to keep local people in the loop. ""If we had a schedule, we could put the animals into barns. At the minute we are on tenterhooks."" The film is being made by Pitt's Plan B company and stars British actors Sienna Miller, Charlie Hunnam and Robert Pattinson. In 2013, Pitt apologised to residents of an Oxfordshire village after they complained about gunfire and tanks being used for the World War Two film Fury.  It was reported at the time that he gave the village a cheque for £1m."

In an exclusive interview with Sky News, George Osborne revealed that companies would now be able to bid for the right to build the rail routes and tunnels for the first phase of High Speed Two, linking London and Birmingham. Actual construction work on the projects, worth almost £12bn, will begin in two years, with the finished route promising to slash the London to Birmingham journey time from one hour 21 minutes to 49 minutes. The Chancellor told Sky News: ""Britain has to raise its game if it wants to stay in the front rank of economic powers, and that means building high speed trains to link up the north to the Midlands to the south of our country. ""What we are announcing today is a major milestone in the delivery of High Speed Two, opening up the bidding for more than £11bn worth of contracts to build the track so that construction can start in just two years’ time. ""That means HS2 becoming a reality."" Mr Osborne made the announcement on the final day of his week-long tour of China. The hope is that Chinese firms are among those bidding for construction rights in the UK. Mr Osborne also announced a plan to open a Chinese pitch book of more than £24bn of investments in his Northern Powerhouse scheme. Earlier in the week, he announced a £2bn UK government guarantee for the construction of a new nuclear reactor at Hinkley, to be part-financed by the Chinese, and a proposed link between the London and Shanghai stock markets. However, some have warned the Chancellor that with the Chinese economy starting to flag, there are potential question marks over its ability to support big British projects in the future.

2015-09-25,The UK's steel industry is urging the Government to announce urgent cash help as thousands of jobs hang in the balance on Teesside.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150925025523/http://news.sky.com/story/1558042/plea-for-cash-as-steel-jobs-hang-in-balance,"The UK's steel industry is urging the Government to announce urgent cash help as thousands of jobs hang in the balance on Teesside. It remains unclear whether SSI UK, which suspended production at its Redcar operations last week, has the money to pay a reported wage bill of £5m on Friday as it struggles with the fallout from a collapse in world steel prices. Local MPs and union officials have accused SSI of presiding over a ""wall of silence"" since announcing the pause in production, which the company blamed on issues with the supply of materials. There are fears it will enter administration without a deal to reorganise its finances or direct Government support. SSI UK, which took over the steelworks in 2011, employs 2,000 staff directly with a further 1,000 contractors on site. The Community Union said its members were ""understandably nervous"" about whether they would be paid - and blamed a lack of dialogue with SSI over the course of the week. It is not the only steelmaker feeling the pressure - with the UK's biggest producer, Tata Steel, also reeling from the impact of weakening demand and cheap imports amid the economic slowdown in China and other emerging markets. The company, which operates two UK blast furnaces at Scunthorpe and Port Talbot, warned in July that job losses - on top of thousands already made since 2007 - were possible. Speaking on a visit to China, the Chancellor George Osborne told Sky News he had ""huge sympathy"" for people whose jobs were under threat. He insisted China formed part of the solution to the steel problem, as he sought Chinese investment in HS2. ""You need steel for construction, you need steel for railway lines. If we're not building anything in Britain, people aren't going to need steel in our country. ""I would say, it's precisely because we're getting underway with the massive civil engineering project of our generation which is HS2, that the demand for things like steel will go up in future."" The industry argues it has been made to be uncompetitive because of high energy costs and the UK tax regime. The steelmakers want the Government to bring forward plans to compensate them for carbon permit costs and are also calling for lower business rates. The Government has said the level of support it can offer is limited because of EU state aid rules but that it had provided more than £47m in compensation for carbon pollution costs and taken action to limit cheap Chinese imports."

Tsar Nicholas II and his wife Alexandra were executed by Bolshevik revolutionaries in 1918, alongside their daughters Olga, Tatiana, Maria and Anastasia and their son, Alexei. On Wednesday, investigators took samples from the remains of Nicholas and Alexandra in a bid to confirm the identification of Alexei's and Maria's remains. While Nicholas, Alexandra and three of their daughters were found in a mass grave in the Urals in 1991 and identified by DNA testing seven years later, the remains thought to be those of Alexei and Maria were not found until 2007. They were discovered some distance away, which is one of the reasons why the Russian Orthodox Church doubts their identification and has asked they be re-examined ahead of being buried with the rest of the family. Senior Investigator Vladimir Solovyov, who heads the investigating team, told Russia's TASS news agency: ""The exhumation was done in the presence of representatives of the Russian Orthodox Church. ""The necessary samples were taken from the remains of Nicholas II and Empress Alexandra Fyodorovna. ""Also, samples for blood from the stains on the full-dress uniform of (Nicholas's grandfather) Emperor Alexander II, who was killed by radical revolutionaries on 1 March 1881."" The remains have now been returned to the crypt of the St Catherine sacrarium in St Peter and Paul's Cathedral in St Petersburg, officials said. Nicholas, Alexandra and the three daughters found in 1991 were reburied in 1998 and canonised by the church in 2000. It is thought Alexei and Maria will also be canonised before the centenary of the murders in 2018 but, until their remains are confirmed, they are being kept at the Russian State Archives. The investigation into the family's murder was opened in 1993 and closed in 1998 because the perpetrators were dead. It has been reopened in the hope of finally discovering the truth about their bloody end. :: Tell Us What You Want From The Sky News App"

Alexander Dobrindt said: ""We have been informed that also in Europe, vehicles with 1.6 and 2.0 litre diesel engines are affected by the manipulations that are being talked about."" He added it was unclear how many vehicles in Europe were affected and confirmed random tests would be carried out on cars made by other manufacturers. The VW controversy is centred on ""defeat devices"" it used to fool US emissions tests on diesel cars into believing the vehicles met environmental standards. :: How Would A Volkswagen Recall Work In UK? The company admits the software, which switches engines to a cleaner mode during official testing, may have been fitted in 11 million vehicles worldwide. VW has not responded to Mr Dobrindt's claim. At least 482,000 cars are to be recalled in the US and the carmaker could face penalties of more than $18bn (£11bn) there alone. The Department for Transport would not immediately comment on Mr Dobrindt's remarks. UK Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin has written to the European Commission to call for a proposed new driving emissions test to be introduced as soon as possible. :: The End Of Europe's Love Affair With Diesel? Crisis management expert Quentin Langley told Sky News the scandal is ""one of the biggest corporate scandals we have ever seen"". He said: ""I think it is bigger than BP with the Gulf of Mexico, bigger than the banking crisis because this was deliberate."" Volkswagen will start firing people responsible for manipulating the tests on Friday, sources told the Reuters news agency. The carmaker's supervisory board will give initial findings from an internal investigation into who was responsible as well as revealing a successor to chief executive Martin Winterkorn, it reported. Reuters later reported the research and development bosses of Audi and Porsche and its top manager in the US will be dismissed. Audi's Ulrich Hackenberg, Porsche's Wolfgang Hatz and US chief executive Michael Horn will be sacked, a source told the news agency. German weekly Spiegel reported that VW's brand development chief Heinz-Jakob Neusser will also go. VW, Porsche and Audi all declined to comment on the report. The full global impact of the scandal is not yet known, with UK drivers waiting to find out if their cars are affected. It has been warned the scandal could lead to Britain's biggest ever class action lawsuit. Bozena Michalowska-Howells of law firm Leigh Day said: ""If it is shown that this piece of software defeated the European testing then Volkswagen would be in a very similar position as it is in the US and may well then have to call in their cars with all the resulting costs involved. ""This could well lead to one of the largest group claims ever in this country against Volkswagen for the way in which consumers may have been misled in relation to their vehicle."" Mr Winterkorn quit VW on Wednesday, saying he accepted responsibility for ""irregularities found in diesel engines"" but had not been aware of any wrongdoing. VW has set aside an initial £4.7bn to cover the fallout and ""win back the trust"" of customers. :: If you are worried your car could be affected by the VW emissions scandal you can contact us on news@sky.com or by text on 84501 :: Tell Us What You Want From The Sky News App"

The ruling in Germany means Lindt can continue to sell the chocolate bears it introduced in 2011. The Switzerland-based firm said it did not copy the golden bear, but simply drew on the styling of the golden bunnies which are already among its best-known products. The chocolate maker heavily promotes the bunnies, even setting up life-sized statues outside its factory by Lake Zurich and rolling out gold-painted, red-striped Smart cars decorated with golden ears around Easter. Lindt argued that it based the bears on its famous bunnies The German Federal Court said terms such as ""teddy"", ""chocolate bear"" or ""chocolate teddy"" could be applied to the product just as well as ""gold bear"". ""It's not sufficient that the trademarked word is just one of several obvious names to describe the product form,"" the court said in a statement. If the claim was granted without meeting stricter criteria this would create the danger of ""product design monopolisation"" in the arena of three-dimensional product forms, the statement added.

But despite improvements in fuel and engine technology, air quality has not been improving. Professor Duncan Laxen founded Air Quality Consultants over 20 years ago, and has served on many working groups for the UK government and for the EU. He told Sky News: “People are being affected by their exposure to this pollution. The concentrations haven’t been reducing even though we have in place Euro standards for most new vehicles coming onto the roads. “That should have brought down concentrations by a considerable amount over the last 15 years. That’s not been happening.” Diesel is a very European fuel. Around half the cars sold here are diesel powered. Although many motorists bought them for financial reasons, such as lower road tax and greater fuel efficiency, a large number bought them because they thought they were greener. Now they're not so sure. In fact, according to the UK's Society of Motor Manufacturers, average CO2 emissions from diesel cars are only fractionally lower than from petrol cars, meaning diesels are not as green as many drivers think. Diesel engines also emit particulates, which can be carcinogenic, and Nitrogen oxide and dioxide which can cause, or make worse, serious health conditions including bronchitis, asthma, heart attacks and strokes. Estimates are that across Europe there are up to 500,000 premature deaths because of air pollution. In London in 2010 the Mayor's office says there were 3,500 premature deaths due to dangerous airborne particles, while Nitrogen Oxides caused 5,900 premature deaths. Even short-term exposure has been found to cause an increase in deaths from heart disease by just under one percent, and from lung disease by just over one percent. The Volkswagen scandal has highlighted existing concerns over the effects of diesel fumes, but experts say the engines that create them do have some advantages. Brian Madderson from the Petrol Retailers Association said: “Diesel engines are robust, the performance has been much improved and torque is excellent and they are perceived to offer much more miles per gallon than a petrol engine. “Those factors, along with tax incentives from successive governments, have resulted in a tsunami of demand for diesel engines over the last 15 years.” The ""diesel dupe"" scandal is set to cost Volkswagen billions of euros and its chief executive his job. It may also have spelt the beginning of the end for Europe's love affair with diesel."

He also called on the EU to conduct a Europe-wide investigation into whether there is evidence that cars in the UK have been fitted with ""defeat devices"". :: How Would A Volkswagen Recall Work In The UK?  The software switches engines to a cleaner mode during official testing - falsely giving the impression that vehicles meet the environmental standards for diesel cars. He added: ""The Government takes the unacceptable actions of VW extremely seriously. ""My priority is to protect the public as we go through the process of investigating what went wrong and what we can do to stop it happening again in the future."" At least 482,000 cars are to be recalled in the US and the carmaker could face penalties of more than $18bn (£11bn) there alone.  :: The End Of Europe's Love Affair With Diesel? According to Volkswagen, 11 million vehicles worldwide have been fitted with defeat devices - and the number of affected cars currently on Europe's roads ""will be cleared up in the next few days"". On Wednesday, Martin Winterkorn quit as VW's chief executive and accepted responsibility for ""irregularities found in diesel engines"". However, he stressed he had not been aware of any wrongdoing. His successor will likely be Matthias Mueller, the 62-year-old boss of Porsche, Reuters reported. It also reported the research and development bosses of Audi and Porsche and its top manager in the US will be dismissed. Crisis management expert Quentin Langley told Sky News the scandal is ""one of the biggest corporate scandals we have ever seen"". He said: ""I think it is bigger than BP with the Gulf of Mexico, bigger than the banking crisis because this was deliberate."" It has been warned the scandal could lead to Britain's biggest ever class action lawsuit. Jacqueline Young, head of group litigation at Slater & Gordon, told Sky News: ""Consumers have probably paid a premium for buying a diesel car - they've made a choice, they want a diesel car because it's fuel economic and because of the green footprint. ""They've obviously been sold something that's not what it seems, so they've paid a premium and now their asset has devalued."" Ms Young added that legal action by shareholders may be possible, while VW motor dealers may also seek compensation because of how the product has been misrepresented to them, and subsequently mis-sold to shoppers."
2015-09-25,A paralysed man has made medical history by walking again after doctors reconnected brain signals to his legs.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150925025523/http://news.sky.com/story/1557862/paralysed-man-walks-with-help-of-brain-power,"A paralysed man has made medical history by walking again after doctors reconnected brain signals to his legs. Adam Fritz, 26, managed to walk nearly four metres without help and with what researchers described as ""a high level of control"". Five years ago the American was left paralysed after he was commuting on his motorbike and a table fell from a truck in front, hitting him and sending him flying. But doctors bypassed his damaged nerves by transmitting signals from his brain to electrodes around his knees. He had to undergo mental training to reactivate his brain's ability to walk and then had months of physical training to prepare his leg muscles. Adam Fritz talking about walking for the first time in five years After 19 unsuccessful attempts, he managed to walk 3.66m. He is still a long way from being able to walk easily alone but, nevertheless, the achievement has been hailed as a medical milestone. Mr Fritz told Sky News: ""It was incredible. ""When you're first injured, you're sitting in hospital hoping you'll walk again but when it actually happened, it was a dream come true. ""I actually did it and it was something I'll never forget."" Mr Fritz said he hopes to walk more with the technology and could even see it being useful around his university campus, adding: ""I think, just watching the way technology evolves, this is something that will continue to grow."" The nerves of the spinal cord are not able to regenerate after they have been severed, so such damage usually means irreversible and lifelong paralysis. Neurologist Dr An Do, of the University of California, said: ""Even after years of paralysis the brain can still generate robust brain waves that can be harnessed to enable basic walking. ""We showed you can restore intuitive, brain-controlled walking after a complete spinal cord injury."" Dr Zoran Nenadic, also involved in the study, said: ""We've been able to, for the first time, allow a person to walk hands-free without pressing buttons. It's a short distance, of course, but in terms of significance, it's a very exciting step."" There have been a few cases of people walking with the help of robotic limbs but this method, revealed in the Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation, would mean patients would not need mechanical help. Scientists behind the development say they also believe it could be possible to send brainwaves in the other direction - from the legs to the brain, meaning the person would be able to feel their legs. And, for anyone finding themselves in the same situation as Mr Fritz was a few years ago, he has this advice: ""Never give up hope, and get involved. ""If there are scientific communities that need participants then get involved. Put yourself out there and really try. That's what I did: I had no idea what was going on - I just signed up for it and look what happened."" :: Tell Us What You Want From The Sky News App"

The most recent attack happened in Gorsedd Gardens in the city centre at 4.30am on Thursday. It was just a few yards from a similar incident on Sunday - and just over half a mile from the scene of another attack on Tuesday morning. A 22-year-old man was arrested early on Thursday on suspicion of sexual assault, and remains in custody. Hours later, South Wales Police confirmed a 40-year-old man had also been detained in connection with Sunday's attack. Detectives said it was too early to link the attacks, which have all occurred near Cardiff University's main campus and the Millennium Stadium, which is hosting Rugby World Cup matches.  The three attacks took place near the city centre Despite the arrests, investigators have stressed their inquiry is ""very much ongoing"". A 20-year-old woman was sexually assaulted near Cardiff University's main building at 3am on Sunday and another was attacked in Cathays Terrace early on Tuesday. Superintendent Andy Valentine said: ""While there are similarities in terms of the locations, times and nature of the offence, it is too early to say whether the same man is responsible. ""We are working extremely hard to identify who is responsible and the victims are being supported by specially trained officers."" Additional patrols are continuing in the area to offer reassurance as visitors travel to the city for the rugby and freshers start university. Police advised people walking around late at night to do so in pairs or groups and in well-lit areas. Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."

A high-speed photography technique known as schlieren was used to capture the incredible images. Supersonic shockwaves are invisible to the naked eye, but photographs using a calcium-K optical filter can capture the change in refractive index caused by the change in air density. The shots had to be carefully timed A carefully timed shot was taken by NASA scientists from the ground as aircraft passed the edge of the sun or moon at supersonic speeds. The images were then cleaned up to produce the incredible results, which were published on its website on Thursday. The images were captured with consumer grade astronomy equipment which can be picked up for around £2,000, meaning anyone should be able to take similar shots if they are willing to make the investment. The images were cleaned up by NASA after they were taken The team behind the photos says it hopes the images can help aerodynamics researchers better understand supersonic flight. It could also lead to a way to design quieter aircraft."

Nearly one million vehicles are recalled each year for safety checks or fixes. According to the AA, the most common reasons include problems with brakes, fuel, airbags, steering, risk of fire, and seat belts. If VW takes action in the UK, car manufacturers would work with the Driver & Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) and the DVLA to contact people and inform them how soon they should return their vehicles to a dealership for inspection. Most drivers would receive a notice by mail. :: Will My VW Be Recalled And What's A 'Non-Code Action'? Technically, VW vehicles are more likely to be subject to a ""non-code action"" rather than a strict recall, which is reserved for problems with parts or engineering that put passengers in danger. A non-code action operates in a similar way, but without the urgency. Volkswagen's problems stem from false testing of nitrogen oxide emissions in the US where the standards are different from the UK.  :: How Much Will It Cost Me? Any changes that need to be made to engines shouldn't cost consumers anything. Dealerships would invoice VW directly, and drivers should not incur any costs. :: Will My UK Car Tax Or MOT Be Affected? Vehicle excise duty is directly related to CO2 emissions, not the nitrogen oxide emissions measured in the rigged tests. Nitrogen oxide levels won't make any difference to UK car tax, according to the AA. MOTs do measure emissions but, to pass an MOT, all vehicles must meet EU standards, and diesel engines affected are unlikely to suddenly surpass the levels currently set – therefore they are unlikely to fail an MOT."

Trevor Taylor, 60, and his son Scott, 31, confronted Paulo Brito on their premises at 4am and grappled with him until police arrived. One of the men is said to have held the suspect in a headlock. Attorney-General Joana Marques Vidal didn't name the two men, but said in a statement to British media: ""The Public Prosecution Service opened an Inquiry, in the scope of which two persons have acquired the status of defendant. ""These two persons have further been imposed the restraining measure of ‘Statement of Identity and Residence’"" The word defendant is a translation of the Portuguese word ""arguido"", which means someone who has been named formally as a suspect. The arguido status allows police to question a suspect and gives the suspect the right to legal representation. The ""statement of identity and residence"" stops a suspect leaving the country and prevents him moving to a different address without informing police. A Portuguese newspaper, Correio da Manha, reported that the initial findings of a post-mortem examination showed Paulo Brito died from asphyxiation, but the full result won't be known until the return of toxicology tests, which could take some weeks. Under Portuguese law homeowners have the right to defend themselves and their property, but any use of force must be proportionate. It is understood Trevor Taylor's wife Jill was the first to see the suspected burglar and called police, while her husband and son restrained him. The family, who are all keen golfers, have left the villa in Vilamoura after renting it to a group of holidaymakers and are thought to be staying with friends nearby. Brito's sister Ana has told Sky News of her anger and grief over her brother's death. Ms Brito said: ""My mum is dying because she lost her first kid and all we hear is that he is a burglar. ""He didn’t try to kill anyone. He didn't have a weapon."""

EE spoke out after the industry's regulator confirmed it was raising annual charges for the 2G, 3G and 4G voice and data spectrum bands to almost £200m. Ofcom argued it brought the charges more into line with those in other countries.  The fees vary by firm, depending on their spectrum use, leaving EE facing the biggest bill as its charge will rise to £75m - an increase of £50m. A spokesman told Sky News: ""We think Ofcom has got this wrong. ""The proposed licence fees for 1800MHz spectrum are based on a flawed approach. ""The trebling of fees is bad news for British consumers and business as it raises the risk that we won’t be able to offer the best  prices, and invest and innovate at the pace we and our customers would like. ""We’re also very disappointed that Ofcom has not reflected the higher costs we’ve taken on to meet enhanced coverage obligations that Ofcom and Government encouraged us to accept."" The mobile industry is under pressure from the Government to expand premier network coverage across more rural areas. Vodafone's response to Ofcom's announcement also reflected that. The company said: ""We will be reviewing Ofcom's proposed spectrum fees over the coming days as they represent a significant increase when we are already investing around £1bn on our network and services this year."" Ofcom said it did not see a case for rising customer bills. It said: ""Mobile operators have a strong incentive to keep prices competitive. ""The operators have had five years' notice that the fees would be increased to reflect full market value and we expect them to have budgeted for this. ""The fees announced today are in line with analysts' expectations and with the amounts that operators pay for accessing spectrum in other countries."" :: Tell Us What You Want From The Sky News App"
2015-09-25,Stargazers will be treated to a rare sight this week: a supermoon and a lunar eclipse.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150925025523/http://news.sky.com/story/1558082/stargazers-set-for-supermoon-lunar-eclipse,"Stargazers will be treated to a rare sight this week: a supermoon and a lunar eclipse. A total lunar eclipse will share the sky with a so-called supermoon on Sunday night or early Monday, depending on where you are. The combination has not been seen since 1982, and will not happen again until 2033. A supermoon occurs when a full or new moon makes its closest approach to Earth, appearing bigger and brighter than usual. It will be the closest full moon of the year, about 30,000 miles closer than the average distance. Gallery: Supermoon Lights Up The Earth And Space The moon's seasonal proximity to the Earth has led to a series of dazzling images from the night sky. Here, it is pictured in Monterrey, Mexico The combination of the two will result in a ""blood supermoon"" - caused by it turning a rusty colour as the moon passes through the Earth's shadow. The full eclipse of the moon will last for more than an hour and be visible, weather permitting, from North and South America, Europe, Africa and western Asia. The moon, Earth and sun will be lined up at around 3.11am UK time, with the eclipse beginning a couple of hours beforehand. The next total lunar eclipse will be in 2018. This weekend's eclipse is the end of a tetrad, a series of four total lunar eclipses set six months apart. The 21st century will see eight tetrads, which is an uncommonly high number. From 1600 to 1900 there were none. Observatories are marking the event with public telescope viewings, although the eclipse will be easily visible to the naked eye. All you will have to do is look to the east, astronomers say. But if the clouds obscure your view, NASA is offering a live video feed of the entire eclipse. Many stargazers, both professional and amateur, do not like the term ""supermoon,"" noting the visible difference between a moon and supermoon is slight to all but the most faithful observers. ""It's not like the difference between an ordinary man and Superman,"" said Alan MacRobert, a senior editor at Sky & Telescope magazine. ""It really ought to be called a tiny, slightly little bit bigger moon, rather than the supermoon."" :: Tell Us What You Want From The Sky News App"

Bloodhound, which can cover a mile in just 3.6 seconds, is at Canary Wharf in London before it is fully tested next year at Newquay Aerohub in Cornwall and later at a desert venue in South Africa. More than 8,000 people are expected to see the supersonic racer in the capital over the coming days. The £10m Bloodhound was assembled at Avonmouth, near Bristol, and is the result of eight years of research, design and production by more than 350 companies and universities. Bloodhound technical details. Pic: Flock and Siemens There are hopes the car can set a new world land speed record by reaching speeds of up to 1,000mph. The record currently stands at 763mph and was set by Andy Green in Thrust SSC at Black Rock Desert in Nevada in 1997. Mr Green, 52, will also be driving Bloodhound, a machine he describes as ""an extraordinary piece of extreme technology"". The car has three power sources - a Rolls Royce EJ200 jet from a Eurofighter Typhoon, a cluster of Nammo hybrid rockets and a Jaguar V8 engine. Between them they can generate 135,000 thrust horsepower - the equivalent of 180 Formula One cars.

The five-year-old was removed from Southampton General Hospital by Brett and Naghmeh King without doctors' consent and taken to Prague for proton beam therapy in August 2014. A report by Portsmouth Safeguarding Children Board into how agencies dealt with the case said he was placed ""at risk of serious harm if anything untoward had happened with regard to the nasogastric tube"". It also added that the journey for Ashya to the Czech Republic ""must have been difficult and if anything had gone wrong the consequences would have been significant"". Mr King told Sky News tonight that the family has seen the report and has agreed with Portsmouth City Council that neither side will comment on its findings. Last week, Ashya's parents told Sky News they were pleased they'd decided on proton therapy as they returned to the Czech capital for a check on his progress. Mr King said his son's improvement had exceeded all expectations and Ashya was becoming ""strong, more social and happier as a person"". ""We are thankful that we did the research and we chose a treatment that was less aggressive than the one they were going to give to us because I’d hate to think with that treatment where would we be today,"" he said. The board also recommended that referral to a proton beam panel should happen routinely for families who ask for the therapy. It also recognised that a breakdown in trust between the parents and medical staff had taken place - partly due to a delay in obtaining a second opinion for the parents. In conclusion, Reg Hooke, Independent Chair of the Portsmouth Safeguarding Children Board, said: ""The Learning Review found that the agencies involved acted appropriately and, given the complicated nature of the case, there was little that could have been done differently in the effort to safeguard the child's welfare."" Ashya's family always argued he was not in danger and said they had bought the feeding equipment and food needed to supply the nutrients he required. The case sparked an international manhunt for Ashya and led to the arrest of the Kings in Spain several days later. They were imprisoned before being released and a High Court judge later approved their request to take Ashya to Prague. There, he underwent proton therapy, which is said to be a more effective treatment than the radiotherapy offered on the NHS. The treatment limits the spread of radiation to other vital organs, such as the heart and liver, which in turn should lead to less severe long-term side-effects including heart and breathing problems. While the therapy was not offered on the NHS, the health service did later agree to fund Ashya's treatment."
