Voters are going to the polls across the country to decide who will form the next government. Polling stations opened at 7am and close at 10pm in the United Kingdom's 650 constituencies. Party leaders were among the first to cast their votes. Conservative leader David Cameron cast his vote at Spelsbury Memorial Hall in Witney, Oxfordshire, accompanied by wife Samantha.

Training continues as normal as the public vote at East Hull Amateur Boxing Club Labour leader Ed Miliband and his wife Justine headed into a polling station at Sutton Village Hall in Doncaster North. UKIP leader Nigel Farage cast his vote at Eastcliff community housing office in Ramsgate, Thanet South. And Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg voted in Sheffield Hallam with his wife Miriam Gonzalez Durantez. Leader of the Green Party Natalie Bennett voted at Ossulston Tenants' Hall in the London constituency of Holborn and St Pancras.

There are 3,971 candidates vying to take up a seat in the House of Commons. There are 533 parliamentary constituencies in England, 59 in Scotland, 40 in Wales and 18 in Northern Ireland. The parties are therefore trying to get 326 seats to command a majority. A total of 10,000 council seats across 290 local authorities are also up for grabs, and six mayors in England will be elected as well. Meanwhile, one of the most talked about General Election topics on Twitter has been dogs that accompanied their owners as they cast their votes. A number of canines were pictured on leads outside polling stations - as #DogsAtPollingStations topped the trends list. But it was not just dogs - there was at least one photo of a cat and another of a lamb."
2015-05-07,The finale of the Spanish season could be disrupted after the country's football federation said it intended to suspend all competitions over a dispute with government.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150507223122/http://news.sky.com/story/1479184/spanish-football-to-be-suspended-indefinitely,"The finale of the Spanish season could be disrupted after the country's football federation said it intended to suspend all competitions over a dispute with government. The RFEF said it would ""suspend competitions of all categories starting from 16 May indefinitely"". This would throw into doubt the penultimate round of La Liga fixtures, due to take place the following day. The wrangle involves a new law introduced to regulate the sale of television rights. The RFEF said it was acting after three months of unsatisfactory talks, but added that they remained ""open to dialogue"" with the government. Gallery: World's Richest Football Clubs 1.

At the moment, Spanish clubs can negotiate their own TV deals. But in an apparent attempt to end the stranglehold of Barcelona and Real Madrid, the Spanish government wants all clubs to negotiate collectively - just as they do in England's Premier League. In another twist, the AFE players' union has threatened to strike over being excluded from the negotiations. Barcelona star Lionel Messi is backing the threat. ""The AFE have met with us,"" he said. ""The players are with them in what they say."""

Navinder Singh Sarao is fighting extradition to the US, where he is wanted in connection with the ""Flash Crash"" in 2010. At Westminster Magistrates' Court he was remanded in custody after failing to have a £5m security removed from the conditions of his bail. The 36-year-old was led away from the dock, shouting to the public gallery: ""I haven't done anything wrong apart from being good at my job. How is this allowed to go on, man?"" Sarao faces 22 charges in the US, including wire fraud, commodities fraud and market manipulation, which is said to have been carried out from his parents' home in Hounslow, west London. The alleged offences carry sentences totalling 380 years. The US Justice Department claims he made £26m illegally in five years. Sarao's assets have been frozen since his arrest - something his lawyers told the court they did not know about when bail terms were set last month. In addition to the £5m needed to secure bail, conditions include his parents providing £50,000. However, James Lewis, QC, defending, told the court it was ""now impossible to supply"" the £5m. District Judge Elizabeth Roscoe ruled the terms should not be altered, adding: ""Bearing in mind the nature of the allegations made - not just the amount but the manner of them as well - I am not of the opinion that £50,000 together with the other conditions would be sufficient to secure your attendance in court."" After her ruling, Mr Lewis told the Ms Roscoe: ""We'll just go to the High Court."" On 6 May 2010 Sarao allegedly made £587,879 in the space of 24 hours by using ""dynamic layering"" computer software to make fake trades. That same day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled by several hundred points in a matter of minutes, before recovering many of the losses. A review hearing in the case is listed for 26 May and a full extradition hearing is set for 24 September."

Police sent a diver with a video camera to the bottom of the Colorado River near La Paz, Arizona, after the alarm was raised. The footage soon revealed it was not a crime scene. Instead, the video shows two fake skeletons sitting in lawn chairs. One of them was apparently wearing aviator shades and a bib. The other holds a partially legible sign, which when river sediment is wiped away seems to include the word ""Bernie"" and the phrase ""Dream in the River"". The sign also includes a possible clue about the prankster - the date, 16 August, 2014."

William and Kate left their London base of Kensington Palace on Wednesday bound for Anmer Hall with toddler George and new baby Charlotte who was born last Saturday. Anmer Hall clad in scaffolding while it was being done up The letters, distributed by Norfolk Police and signed by the Cambridges' communications secretary, say the couple have ""a more than reasonable expectation of privacy"". It called for ""acts of harassment and breaches of privacy to cease"". The letter went on: ""There have in the past been a number of intrusions into the privacy of the Royal Family which in the main have been as a result of professional photographers using long-distance lenses, not only to observe the Royal Family, but also to photograph them going about their activities on the estate."" Earlier cautions to photographers meant ""the position has greatly improved"", the letter said. But, it continued: ""However, we would remind you again of the position. The Sandringham Estate trusts that there will not be a need to take any further action other than bringing these points to your attention."" A Kensington Palace spokeswoman said the interest in the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge was ""warm-hearted and understandable"" but added that this needed to balanced with their right to private family life. She said: ""This is a letter given by police to individuals found operating on or around the Sandringham estate, including Anmer, on behalf of the royal household. ""It reminds them of their responsibilities and the rights of the estate. ""Media are encouraged to speak to royal communications for further guidance about where they can operate on this private estate."" William and Kate will spend the next few weeks in the country house that was given to them by the Queen. William has two weeks' paternity leave from his job as an air ambulance helicopter pilot and will join his wife and George in getting to know the latest member of their family. The 10-bedroom secluded red brick mansion is a short drive from Sandringham House itself and is where the couple are thought to want to spend much of their time while their children are young. They recently spent around £1.5m on renovations so that the house not only has a new roof, swimming pool and tennis court but also a new kitchen, garden room and nursery, as well as separate accommodation for the children's nanny."

The manufacturer of heavy industrial equipment has confirmed it is to slash a further 4,500 jobs worldwide as part of a cost-cutting drive. Around 2,200 of the jobs are expected to go in Germany, but the firm said it was unable to give a breakdown of where the other redundancies will be made. ""We cannot disclose any details,"" a spokesman said, adding staff and their representatives would be informed first. Siemens employs around 343,000 people in 200 countries, including the UK. The job losses are on top of the 7,800 redundancies announced by Siemens in February. The fresh round of cuts come as the company reported profits had fallen by 5% to €1.7bn (£1.3bn) in the first three months of the year compared to the same period last year. It said: ""These measures are being taken in response to the persistently difficult environment in the global power generation market."" Challenges faced by the company included regulatory changes, price erosion and aggressive competitors. Siemens chief executive Joe Kaeser said: ""For business volume, we performed well in our markets. ""The profitability of our industrial business shows that we must still improve some businesses."""

The results for the 13-week period to May are the first for the new chief executive David Potts. David Potts was appointed to lead the Morrisons fightback The figures show they have arrested the big falls seen in recent quarters - down 7.1% for the same period a year ago - but like the other ""Big Four"" supermarket giants continue to struggle in the face of stiff competition and an industry price war. Shares fell 7% following the update. The company said that during the period, more stores were closed than were opened leading to an overall fall in retail space of 50,000 sq ft. Steps were also being taken to ""simplify"" head office, which is anticipated to lead to one-off costs of up to £40m during 2015/16. Morrisons said in its interim management statement: ""Our priorities are to improve the customers' shopping trip and make our core supermarkets strong again. ""We are listening hard to customers and colleagues and, wherever possible, we are responding quickly."" Mr Potts, who joined the business on 16 March, said: ""This is a business with many attributes, some unique. ""Our task is to use those advantages to improve the shopping trip to customers and create value."" The firm is expecting underlying profit before tax to be higher in the second half than the first. It said the focus continued to be ""to invest more for customers in order to build trading momentum""."

Brandon Hoffman is charged with involuntary manslaughter in the death of Bryson Shoemaker. Hoffman, 20, was performing a move used by professional wrestler The Undertaker known to fans as ""The Last Ride"", police said. He intended to slam the toddler on the bed but the child landed head first on the hardwood floor, according to court papers. Lonnie Stewart, who shares the apartment in Jersey Shore with Hoffman and his sister, told WNEP-TV he was at home but not in the room when the incident occurred. ""He came to me like, 'I don't know what happened. I dropped him',"" Mr Stewart said. ""He was like real hysterical and everything."" Hoffman told police he attempted to resuscitate the child before rushing him to hospital. Bryson was then transferred to another hospital where he died, authorities said. Hoffman told police he did not call 911 because he feared getting in trouble. His sister, Angelina Hoffman, told WNEP she has been trying to comfort the child's mother. She said the mother told her that she did not believe Hoffman would hurt the boy on purpose. An online site has been set up to accept donations to help pay for Bryson's funeral. In addition to involuntary manslaughter, Hoffman faces charges of endangering the welfare of a child, aggravated assault and other offences. He is scheduled to appear in court on 13 May."

2015-05-07,":: Follow the election results live on skynews.com, our mobile apps and on Sky News TV from 10pm on Thursday.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150507223122/http://news.sky.com/story/1475480/deal-or-no-deal-party-pact-options-explained,":: Follow the election results live on skynews.com, our mobile apps and on Sky News TV from 10pm on Thursday. It's simple maths. Either one party or a combination of parties needs to put together enough seats to make a majority government so they can command the confidence of the House of Commons (get stuff done). There are 650 seats in the House of Commons but because the Speaker doesn't count and Sinn Fein MPs don't take their seats, the magic number for a majority is around 323 - rather than 326. In 2010 Conservatives (307) + Lib Dems (57) = coalition (364). This time, projections indicate it may not be quite so simple. Even if parties settle for a minority government, 323 MPs still need to support its programme for the next five years which will be set out in the Queen's Speech on 27 May. Here are the deals that could be on the table in the battle for power. What kind of deal could these two strike? :: Labour/SNP Probably the best chance of a two-party deal. Projections made for Sky News based on polling have consistently suggested the combination of Ed Miliband and Nicola Sturgeon's parties could hit the magic 323 for a majority government. But Mr Miliband ruled out ""deals or coalitions"" with the SNP during the leaders' Question Time session, saying there would be no Labour government if that's what it took. He has left himself little wriggle room come 8 May - is it at all possible for him to negotiate vote-by-vote support or some other kind of agreement without being accused of breaking promises? ""I'll be your brains"" :: Labour/Lib Dem Likely a better fit than in 2010 and Nick Clegg has offered to be the ""brains"" of a Labour deal - the ""heart"" of a Tory one (follow the yellow brick road and all). He has also said he thinks of Ed Balls when he is kickboxing so it's very much mixed messages.  Given the Lib Dems are expected to see the number of seats they hold halved it is unlikely Mr Clegg could even put Mr Miliband in Number 10 without extra help. :: Labour/SNP/Lib Dems In the event Labour and the SNP need topping up then they may appeal to Nick Clegg's party to make up the numbers. It's unlikely though. The Lib Dem leader has made it plain he will not consider working with a party whose prime aim is to break up the Union. We can put you in power :: Labour/SNP/Green/Plaid Cymru/DUP It has been abundantly clear from the televised debates that Nicola Sturgeon, Plaid's Leanne Wood and the Greens' Natalie Bennett have been talking. Ms Sturgeon said as much. Her offer to put Mr Miliband in Number 10 included the backing of the Greens and Plaid. Just no :: Tory/SNP Absolutely no way. Not. Going. To. Happen. Ruled out by everyone. Golden days :: Tory/Lib Dem What might have seemed a relatively safe bet six weeks ago, now seems less and less likely. Senior Lib Dems have been making noises suggesting Mr Clegg would have a very difficult job persuading the party to get back into bed with David Cameron's party. In the dying days of coalition even Mr Clegg started talking about the Tory ""headbangers"" taking over the show. The differences between the two parties are greater than in 2010. There are the not inconsiderable stumbling blocks of an EU referendum, scrapping the Human Rights Act and welfare cuts for a start. It would be unwise to put any money on a formal coalition/Rose Garden love-in this time. In any event, Mr Clegg's party is unlikely to win enough seats to put a Tory/Lib Dem coalition within touching distance of the magic 323. Cameron and Farage: no way Any minority coalition would be very unstable indeed. :: Tory/Lib Dem/DUP/UKIP There's still a feeling the Conservatives are likely to win a far greater number of seats than the projections have been forecasting. Even so they are going to struggle to get enough support together to form a majority. With a significantly weakened Lib Dems it could leave Mr Cameron casting around. The Right-leaning DUP has said it will support either the Tories or Labour - it will, of course, want something in return. A four-way deal would be a messy series of agreements, vote-by-vote deals and horse trading. It would be a hard centre to hold. A three-way deal here would be more likely mainly because Mr Clegg refused to be any part of a deal including Nigel Farage. :: Tory/UKIP The Tories have ruled it out. Mr Farage has said he's happy to talk but will want that EU referendum, pronto. The maths is unlikely to add up here unless the Tories emerge triumphant from significantly more constituency contests than has been forecast in even the most optimistic projections (from their point of view). UKIP is expected to manage no more than a small handful of seats at the most. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? :: Tory/Labour A grand coalition. It's not so mad as all that. If no government can be formed and the markets start to tank then desperate times may indeed call for desperate measures. Labour stalwart Charles Clarke, who was in Tony Blair's Cabinet, has said the prospect is not ""unthinkable"" and the Tories' Lord Baker has said Mr Miliband and Mr Cameron should unite to see off the threat of the SNP.  A small number of Labour and Conservative MPs have suggested it would not be such a bad idea."
2015-05-07,It is the election that no leader can win - even if they do win.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150507223122/http://news.sky.com/story/1478842/can-the-leaders-survive-the-election-fallout,"It is the election that no leader can win - even if they do win. David Cameron, Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg and Nigel Farage could all be wondering if they will have a job when the dust settles on the General Election. Here's the verdict on how the leaders have performed over the last five years and what their chances are of surviving until 2020. Clegg keeps his eye on the ball :: Nick Clegg There is an argument about Nick Clegg's time in coalition that runs along the lines that he is the politician who has achieved the most, with the least power. It's the very thing that has made him so unpopular. To get what he wanted, he has had to make some significant sacrifices, from which he will never recover. Actually it's mainly just the one but it will be his political epitaph: ""student tuition fees U-turn"". :: See How The Government Could Shake Down With Shaker Maker That said, the Tories will be reluctant to let him go. They need Mr Clegg if they want a Lib Dem coalition. There have been rumblings that senior party members have no wish to reprise the 2010 deal. The parties are more ideologically opposed than five years ago. Labour, however, would arguably rather deal with Vince Cable, who has held the coalition at arms' length/missed very few opportunities to criticise his Conservative colleagues. Former party chairman Tim Farron has also been mentioned as potential next leader. Although Mr Clegg says he has the energy to continue as Lib Dem leader, there's no getting away from the fact he has presided over a crash in party support - even if the Lib Dems perform considerably better than has been predicted. And, of course, despite Tory efforts to save him, winning back his Sheffield Hallam seat is far from a sure thing. Is Cameron's star waning? If the Lib Dems are to rebuild as a significant force for 2020, Mr Clegg will have to go and there's a feeling that if the party is not needed for a coalition or he loses his seat that could be sooner rather than later. :: David Cameron David Cameron has not helped himself by firing his own Tory leadership race gun - and then listing his possible successors. He said he would serve no more than two terms and it remains to be seen if he will even make the second much less last the full five years if he does. Arguably at the very least, any Conservative leader who fails to win a significant majority against one of the most unpopular Labour leaders of all time when the party is likely to be wiped out in Scotland has ""questions to answer"". Candy from a baby and all. Some Tory donors have expressed misgivings about the way Mr Cameron has conducted himself during the six-week campaign despite ""pumped up"" Dave making an appearance with shirt sleeves suitably rolled up in the later stages. If the Conservatives fail to form the next government expect a fairly swift leadership contest. Boris Johnson, Theresa May and George Osborne are all in the frame, although whether they would be reasonable propositions for 2020 is up for debate. If the party does scrape together a coalition, Mr Cameron may still face a challenge for all the reasons above. Farage yawns as the campaign draws to a close In any event he is unlikely to serve the full five years because the Tories will want someone new at the helm ready to tackle the 2020 vote. :: Nigel Farage Despite his attempts to thrust others into the limelight, Nigel Farage is still UKIP and UKIP is still Nigel Farage. His success as leader was phenomenal right up to November last year, when this party started to look like a spent force. Sure he delivered the ""earthquake"" promised in the local and European elections, and he has seen two MPs win seats in by-elections but there is an argument he has failed to capitalise. And the party is still afflicted by candidates who choose to express themselves in ways considered homophobic, sexist, threatening, or all three. There are also doubts that Mr Farage will win South Thanet despite focussing virtually all his campaign attentions on the seat. He has previously said if he failed to win the seat he would have to reconsider his leadership - but in those interviews he always worked on the assumption there was no chance of him losing. Then there have been concerns about his health - he admits he did too much in the early days of the election campaign and has been on medication for back problems caused by the airplane crash he was in on polling day in 2010. If UKIP is to prove itself as a party it will need to be able to continue to muster significant support under another leader. Miliband has struggled with sibling rivalry Douglas Carswell, the former Conservative who became UKIP's first MP, has to be in the frame, as does Suzanne Evans, who drew up the party's manifesto. The party deputy Paul Nuttall is also likely to be in the running. :: Ed Miliband In his favour, the Labour leader hasn't been the election campaign car crash the Conservatives were expecting. His performance, which has seen an astonishing reversal of his dismal popularity poll ratings, has surprised many - particularly as he was coming from such a low base. But six weeks of good performances cannot make up for five years of bad polls. In November an Ipsos/Mori poll named him the most unpopular Labour leader ever among the party's own supporters. His entire time at the top has been blighted by suggestions of imminent leadership challenges and the consistent drip, dripping of commentary insisting his brother, David, would have done a better job. Under his tenure Labour has seen its support in Scotland all but wiped out but at every stage - a referendum on independence and an election campaign - he has failed to tackle the soaring SNP. In the last six weeks he has spent his time ruling out coalitions with Nicola Sturgeon but he has not tackled her on the party's performance on NHS targets in Scotland or the plummeting oil revenue forecasts which undermine the case for independence it outlined before September's referendum. One can only assume this is so he can blame any considerable Labour losses on the Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy. What makes Mr Miliband's position safer than the other leaders is the paucity of likely successors. Yvette Cooper is arguably the only one ready to make the step up but it is starting to feel like her window of opportunity is closing - the same goes for Andy Burnham. Chuka Umunna and Rachel Reeves feel like they need more time. In the event of a loss it might mean Mr Miliband will stick around for a while before the party is ready to rebrand at the top. (There is talk brother David has an eye on returning from the US to lead Labour into 2020.) And if he wins then he will likely stay at the top at lot longer - although it may not be safe to put money on him staying the course for the full five years."
2015-05-07,A British diving instructor has been shot dead in front of his wife in the Bahamas.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150507223122/http://news.sky.com/story/1478487/uk-diving-teacher-shot-dead-in-bahamas-robbery,"A British diving instructor has been shot dead in front of his wife in the Bahamas. Gary Vanhoeck, 51, was shot twice in the head by masked raiders during a robbery on the couple's luxury yacht. His wife Kathryn, 42, also a diver, was tied up by the men and forced to watch her husband die. She was otherwise unharmed during the incident on the Caribbean island of New Providence, where James Bond movie Thunderball was filmed. The couple were moored on their boat when they were ambushed by men demanding money. Police are appealing for help in hunting four suspects. Two reportedly tied up a security guard while the other two launched the attack. Mr Vanhoeck's brother Wayne said his family are ""absolutely devastated"" by the murder. ""It's been a few days now, but it's all still a blur. It's unreal,"" he told Sky News. ""Gary was a fantastic brother and friend. He was living his dream. He didn't deserve to die that way. ""We're devastated. It's such a shock to us all. The whole family is absolutely devastated."" Mr Vanhoeck's colleague, Michelle Cove, told Sky News: ""He loved his wife so much and his son, Chris. He loved them more than anything. ""He had a passion for cooking - he was an unbelievable chef. I often used to say to him: 'How can you work all day - it's a tough job, it's very physical - and go home and cook these phenomenal meals you can't even find in a restaurant?' ""He says: 'You know, I find it quite therapeutic at the end of the day to have a glass of wine and cook a beautiful meal for my lovely wife.' ""I really admire him. I'm going to miss him so much. We are all just in shock,"" said Ms Cove. A spokesman for Nassau Police said: ""Police have launched an island-wide manhunt for the suspects responsible for a shooting incident that left a man dead on Friday 1 May. ""According to reports, around 10pm, a man who is a British national residing in the Bahamas for a number of years, was at home on his sailboat located at western New Providence near a place where he is employed, when two men armed with handguns accosted him and demanded cash. ""The men fired two shots hitting the victim before fleeing on foot. ""The victim was pronounced dead at the scene. Police are searching for four men in connection with this incident. Investigations are ongoing."" Mr Vanhoeck, originally from Grimsby, Humberside, wrote on his blog that he and his wife were loving life on the island - ""living like pirates, diving in the Caribbean"". His death raised the number of people murdered in the Bahamas this year to 49 - a 19% increase on 2014 - according to the Nassau Guardian. The incident comes a year after Briton Edgar Dart was killed when struggling with robbers who had broken into his mother's home in the Emerald Bay area of Grand Bahama. Three masked intruders had cut phone lines to the house before entering, carrying a handgun and a machete. The men tied up Mr Dart's family and made off with jewellery and other personal belongings."
2015-05-07,"The former Arsenal and England footballer Tony Adams has approached City investors about backing a £150m takeover of Aston Villa, the struggling Premier League club.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150507223122/http://news.sky.com/story/1479493/ex-arsenal-captain-adams-eyes-villa-takeover,"By Mark Kleinman, City Editor The former Arsenal and England footballer Tony Adams has approached City investors about backing a £150m takeover of Aston Villa, the struggling Premier League club. Sky News has learnt that Mr Adams has been working with Paul Smith, a former executive at Chelsea FC and IMG, the sports rights agency, on a possible bid. They have approached a number of private equity and other investment firms in recent weeks in an effort to raise approximately £75m in new equity to finance an offer for Aston Villa. The remainder of the funding for a takeover would probably be in the form of new debt, with a unit of Goldman Sachs understood to have been sounded out about providing the additional capital. Mr Adams and Mr Smith are said to have formed a new company called Halo which they intend to use as a vehicle to acquire Aston Villa and minority stakes in other leading football clubs. One City source said on Thursday that Portugal's Sporting Lisbon and Italy's Internazionale were among the other clubs in which Halo was likely to express an interest. Brazil and Belgium are also among the national leagues that the vehicle was assessing, with Mr Adams and Mr Smith interested in establishing an international network that would create ""a long supply chain of playing talent"", a source said. It is unclear whether they have yet secured financial backing for their plans. Aston Villa has effectively been up for sale for more than a year, with Randy Lerner, the American tycoon who bought it for just over £60m in 2006, keen to offload it. Mr Lerner has ploughed tens of millions of pounds into the West Midlands club, with some initial success in the form of several top six Premier League finishes. However, recent seasons have seen Aston Villa reverting to a persistent battle against relegation. Last year, Mr Lerner appointed Bank of America Merrill Lynch, to handle an auction of Aston Villa, and dozens of parties are since said to have lodged an interest. Halo has been given access to a data room holding information on Aston Villa's finances, although its bid is not understood to be the current frontrunner of those remaining in the process, sources indicated on Thursday. Mr Lerner's advisers will wait until Aston Villa's Premier League fate is resolved before holding further serious talks with any of the remaining potential buyers, who also include at least one US-based consortium, according to insiders. The club currently stand 14th in the table but are only two points clear of the relegation zone with three games left. Relegation from English football's top flight could have a profound impact on the value of Aston Villa, partly because a new £5bn-plus television rights deal (partly funded by Sky plc, the owner of Sky News) is due to begin in the 2016-17 season. Regarded as one of Arsenal's best-ever players, Mr Adams has since had an indifferent stint in football management, initially with Wycombe Wanderers and more recently in Azerbaijan. Coincidentally, Arsenal and Aston Villa will meet later this month in the FA Cup Final at Wembley. Neither Mr Adams nor Mr Smith could be reached for comment, while BAML declined to comment. Aston Villa is not the only Premier League club expected to change hands in the next few months. Crystal Palace has been discussing a capital injection led by a group of wealthy Wall Street financiers, while Tottenham Hotspur and Queens Park Rangers have also been linked with potential takeovers."
2015-05-07,"Consumers may be missing out on billions in compensation for delayed flights, as airlines defer payouts to passengers who have been held up, Sky News has learned.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150507223122/http://news.sky.com/story/1479067/consumers-miss-out-on-delayed-flight-payments,"By Poppy Trowbridge, Consumer Affairs Correspondent Consumers may be missing out on billions in compensation for delayed flights, as airlines defer payouts to passengers who have been held up, Sky News has learned. Flight delay data shows 3.27 million passengers travelling to and from UK airports each year may have a potential claim. The European Commission introduced the compensation laws 10 years ago. With an average claim of around €430 (£320), that means €1.4bn a year in compensation may be available for passengers who have been delayed more than three hours. But lawyers say it is just recently that landmark court rulings have helped establish a clear precedent. Coby Benson, an aviation lawyer with Bott & Co, who helped establish this area of law in the UK, told Sky News: ""The intention of the European Commission is that lawyers should never have been involved in this the first place. ""It was supposed to be a very easy system for passengers to gain compensation themselves when their flights are cancelled or delayed or they have been denied boarding. ""It's just unfortunate that the airlines more often than not make it extremely difficult for passengers to claim compensation and put obstacles in their way."" Europe-wide legislation was introduced in 2004, which says that if your flight is delayed by more than three hours and not caused by ""extraordinary circumstances"" like freak weather, volcanic ash, or terrorism, passengers are entitled to claim some compensation. The amount consumers can claim ranges from €250 (£186) to €600 (£446), depending on the distance travelled and length of delay. About 1.5% of flights into and out of the UK are delayed longer than three hours, European Commission figures show. Iain Osborne, director of regulatory policy at the Civil Aviation Authority, says some types of operators, such as package holiday firms, are more likely to face delays. He says the nature of their business means they are extremely hesitant to completely cancel flights, leading to delays instead. ""There is no doubt that some airlines manage this better than others and consumers shouldn't put up with nonsense,"" he said. ""Come to the regulator if you have a problem."" Richard Rubin, of the claims management website Refund.me, says some airlines are quicker to pay compensation than others. He says his firm deals with around 300 different carriers. ""There is a small minority who just flaunt the law, disrespect the law and fob off the consumer."""

Hundreds gathered at the city's famous Opera House to greet the Prince as he came to the end of a month-long attachment with the Australian Defence Force. He spent more than half an hour meeting schoolchildren and shaking hands with fans, some holding signs which read ""Marry me Harry,"" ""His Royal Hotness"" and ""Gingers Rule"". Victoria McRae, 21, wore a sequinned Australian flag dress and a plastic gold tiara and held up a sign which read: ""Marry Me Prince Harry - Last Chance!"" After getting the chance to pop the question in person, she grabbed the Prince round the neck and surprised him with a kiss - to the delight of the crowds. Gallery: Harry Gets Third Marriage Offer From Same Girl Royal superfan Victoria McRae wears a tiara to prove her princess credentials as she waits Harry, dressed in his military uniform, told her he would ""have to think about that"", and then bit his knuckles. The student said: ""I got to kiss him. And I got to kiss the premier, who I didn't know was the premier.   ""I got Harry's lips, I only got the premier on the cheek."" Ms McRae told reporters she had kayaked into Sydney harbour with a sign popping the question in 2013 and also asked Prince William to pass on her proposal during his tour of the country last year. Another fan, Anne Woods, gave Harry a stuffed koala for his new niece Princess Charlotte, but while he thanked her, he said he wanted to keep it for himself. ""It was just lovely, just lovely to give him a gift for all the charity work (the Prince does),"" she said. Before meeting the crowds, the Prince took part in a military exercise in Sydney Harbour. While Harry has been away, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's daughter, Charlotte Elizabeth Diana, was born on 2 May. The Prince, who moved down to fifth in line to the throne following the baby's arrival, described his niece as ""absolutely beautiful"" and said he could not wait to meet her."
2015-05-07,Clydesdale Bank is set to be hived off from its Australian parent company and then floated on the stock market.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150507223122/http://news.sky.com/story/1479324/clydesdale-set-to-split-from-oz-parent-bank,"Clydesdale Bank is set to be hived off from its Australian parent company and then floated on the stock market. The split of the Glasgow-based high street lender from National Australia Bank (NAB) is planned to go through by the end of the year. Up to 30% of Clydesdale, which includes Yorkshire Bank, will be sold off  to institutional investors. The rest will be held by existing NAB shareholders. In a half year results statement, NAB said: ""Following a period of successful restructuring, the UK Banking business is now in a position to be demerged to shareholders and listed as a standalone retail and business bank."" NAB said last autumn the Clydesdale demerger was an ''absolute priority'' after it reported a dip in full-year profits, which was blamed on its UK banking business. However, it acknowledged there was ""no certainty"" the move would go ahead, remaining subject to approval by shareholders and regulatory authorities in both the UK and Australia. ""Additionally, the demerger and IPO will be a substantial and complex undertaking subject to a range of risks and issues,"" it said. UK regulators have demanded NAB earmarks up to £1.7bn to cover potential losses from mis-selling and other conduct issues. Only last month Clydesdale Bank was fined a record £20.7m after it was found that thousands of PPI complaints may have been rejected unfairly. NAB chief executive Andrew Thorburn said: ""In relation to exiting our UK banking business, we have been examining a broad range of options including those provided by public markets. ""It is a priority to exit this business, and we are today announcing our intention to pursue a demerger and IPO of the UK banking business."" Debbie Crosbie, Clydesdale's acting chief executive, said: ""Today's announcement marks the beginning of an exciting new opportunity for Clydesdale and Yorkshire Banks. ""Our performance is improving and we're providing real customer choice in the UK which is driving encouraging growth across our target retail and SME markets."""
