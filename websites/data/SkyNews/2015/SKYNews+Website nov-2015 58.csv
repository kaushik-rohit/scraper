As investigators reach the wreckage Sky News looks at what we know and what may have caused the disaster. :: What happened? The Airbus A321, operated by a small Russian airline bound for St Petersburg, took off from the holiday resort of Sharm el-Sheikh at 5.58am local time carrying 224 people - mostly tourists. At 6.20am it vanished from radar screens while flying at an altitude of 31,000ft over the mountainous area of Arish and went into a ""rapid descent"". :: Who was on board? It is believed that all but four of the passengers on board were Russian, and the rest were Ukrainian. There were seven crew members, and 25 children recorded in the flight manifest.  Pictures of the victims are now starting to emerge. :: Is the A321 safe? According to former head of flight operations at the Civil Aviation Authority Mike Vivian, the aircraft has an ""excellent safety record"".  :: And the airline? Kogalymavia, which was flying under the Metrojet banner, is a small airline that mainly operates internal flights and some holiday flights to Turkey and Egypt. Its fleet consists of two A320s and seven A321s. It is not on the EU blacklist of Russian airlines banned over European airspace and has had only one serious incident - in 2011 there was a problem with an aircraft on the ground which caused an accident killing three people. According to the Interfax news agency, Russia's state transport regulator Rostransnadzor found violations when it last conducted a routine flight safety inspection of the airline in March 2014. The airline reportedly remedied the breaches following the inspection. :: What about the aircraft itself? In a statement on its website, Airbus said the plane was produced in 1997 and had accumulated some 56,000 flight hours in nearly 21,000 flights. Metrojet, meanwhile, said the A321 received required factory maintenance in 2014. The wife of the plane's co-pilot has claimed he complained about the state of the plane before the flight. Sergei Truckahev reportedly called his daughter to say ""the technical condition of the aircraft left much to be desired"". :: Was it mechanical failure? Egyptian authorities have said the pilot did contact air traffic controllers saying that there was a technical problem and he would make an emergency landing at a nearby airport. Officials at the scene of the crash have said the aircraft had a ""vertical landing"" and had split in two and early investigations have pointed to a technical fault, according to investigators. However, experts say a technical fault is unlikely, mainly because of the the A321's good performance. Airsafe.com gives it a mid-table ranking with just 0.10 incidents per one million flights. :: What else could have caused it? Weather conditions could have been a factor, but there were no reports of poor weather in the area. In addition it could have been pilot error. Again, experts say this is unlikely and the airline has said it believes there are no grounds to blame human error. The captain, identified on the Metrojet website as Valery Nemov, had 12,000 hours of flying experience, including 3,860 in A321s. The crew recently underwent medical tests and no problems were found, Interfax reported, citing prosecutors. :: Terrorists? An IS-linked group has reportedly claimed responsibility, however it must be pointed out that there are significant doubts that it would have the capability to bring down a flight from 31,000ft.  Russia last month launched military strikes in Syria against IS and other rebel groups fighting the Bashar al Assad regime. Egypt's North Sinai is home to a two-year-old Islamist insurgency. Militants linked to Islamic State have killed hundreds of soldiers and have also attacked Western targets in recent months. Sharm el-Sheikh is a key holiday resort and any attack would significantly damage Egypt’s tourism industry. Former head of flight operations at the Civil Aviation Authority Mike Vivian told Sky News ""hostile action"" should not be ruled out. Egyptian authorities were quick to shut down suggestions the plane had been shot from the sky. :: What is key for investigators? Rescue teams are now at the crash site and have found the plane's black boxes, which will provide data from inside the plane and help them gain greater insight into what happened in the short time before the plane began its rapid descent."
2015-11-01,"Released from his tiny cell after 14 years held without charge but accused of terrorism, Shaker Aamer returns to Britain more dangerous than he ever could have been on the battlefield of Afghanistan.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151101042300/http://news.sky.com/story/1578888/why-uk-and-us-may-fear-a-free-shaker-aamer,"Released from his tiny cell after 14 years held without charge but accused of terrorism, Shaker Aamer returns to Britain more dangerous than he ever could have been on the battlefield of Afghanistan. A Saudi Arabian citizen married to a British woman and with four British children, he was captured by bounty hunters in Afghanistan in 2001 and handed on to American forces, where he was held at Bagram Airfield's notorious detention centre, before being flown to a bizarre legal limbo in the netherworld of Guantanamo Bay prison. There, alongside the 800 or so people who have passed through the facility which sits on a tiny piece of Cuba but is under American control, he was neither a prisoner of war not granted the everyday rights held by ordinary Americans. Shaker Aamer's family waited for his release for 14 years But he was, his supporters say, a witness to what went on - for almost a decade-and-a-half. And that is what makes him a ticking bomb in political and legal circles. He alleges that he was tortured into confession. He alleges that this was by the Central Intelligence Agency and witnessed by Britain’s Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. Gallery: The Campaign To Free Shaker Aamer A giant inflatable figure of Shaker Aamer, the last Briton to be detained in Guantanamo Bay, is pictured during a protest by the We Stand With Shaker campaign group outside the U.S embassy on February 13, 2015 in London Deemed ""non-cooperative"", he was put in solitary confinement and allegedly subjected to 300 beatings by the ""forcible cell extraction"" unit in Guantanamo. American authorities have said that many (the figures vary between 15 and around 80) former Guantanamo prisoners who have already been released have returned to the ranks of militant organisations. Some have certainly emerged as leaders of the Taliban and been killed in drone strikes so not all detainees can be said to have been innocent - not at least after their release. But Mr Aamer was cleared for release in 2007, and again three years later, by American authorities across six different departments - his lawyers and supporters believe he was kept locked up because intelligence agencies in the US and probably the UK wanted him to be released to Saudi Arabia. The implication here is that the Saudi authorities, unbound by democratic restraints, would be able to keep him out of circulation, and keep him quiet, indefinitely. Given that the British Government joined calls for his release, it would appear that he will be free once home. Whether he decides to speak out about what happened to him - and to those he was incarcerated with - remains to be seen but given his articulate campaigning from prison the odds are he will be noisy. And so the role of MI6 and the CIA in ""extraordinary renditions"" - the kidnapping of suspects and their secret transfer to detention camps around the world and Guantanamo, allegation of abuse, and of incompetence on the part of foreign spooks in their over-enthusiastic rush to prosecute the War on Terror, will surface once again. On top of that, Mr Aamer's release will again cause many to pause to reflect whether the US, and her allies, have abandoned the very principles of democracy they wish to defend. Combined with the continued use of drone strikes - which involve the extrajudicial execution of alleged terrorists outside of war zones - this case gets even stronger in the minds of America's critics. Gallery: Current And Former Inmates' Allegations Some security officials point to the success of their operations, which would include drones and detentions, as having prevented numerous terrorist attacks against the West. They are, no doubt, correct. But these tactics do besmirch the reputations of those nations involved in them - of that there simply is no doubt. Images of orange jumpsuited detainees bent double, held in stress positions and blindfolded, have served to undermine America's reputation in the regions where it needs most repair against the charges of hypocrisy - notably in the Islamic world."
2015-11-01,A large asteroid which bears an eerie resemblance to a human skull has narrowly missed Earth.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151101042300/http://news.sky.com/story/1579225/skull-asteroid-skims-past-on-halloween,"A large asteroid which bears an eerie resemblance to a human skull has narrowly missed Earth. Known as 2015 TB145 and discovered just three weeks ago, the 1,300ft-diameter rock shot past the planet at around 5pm on Halloween. It came within about 300,000 miles of Earth, farther away than the moon but relatively close by cosmic measures. Astronomers were hoping to capture radar images and other measurements of the asteroid to find out more about its shape, dimensions, surface features and other characteristics. NASA scientist Kelly Fast said: ""The IRTF [NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility] data may indicate that the object might be a dead comet, but in the Arecibo images it appears to have donned a skull costume for its Halloween flyby."" Aside from pure scientific value, the encounter could help develop better tracking techniques and counter-measures for asteroids that may be on a collision course with Earth. Mr Chodas said: ""If we ever had to deflect an asteroid we would need to know a lot about it. And we don't know much about asteroids in general, their structure, how strong they are, are they fill of holes, is it like swiss cheese or are they more solid.  ""We really don't know the average density of a lot of the asteroid types so we need to learn more about how asteroids are put together, their structure, if we ever want to deflect one that's headed toward the earth."" Small space rocks rain down on Earth constantly, with most disintegrating as they blaze through the atmosphere."
2015-11-01,"Actor Al Molinaro, who played Al in the TV series Happy Days, has died at the age of 96 from medical complications.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151101042300/http://news.sky.com/story/1579291/happy-days-tv-star-al-molinaro-dies-age-96,"Actor Al Molinaro, who played Al in the TV series Happy Days, has died at the age of 96 from medical complications. Molinaro's son, Michael, confirmed his father had passed away at a hospital in Glendale, California. He died from complications arising from gallstones. Molinaro featured in over 140 episodes of Happy Days, playing the owner of Arnold's Drive-In - the Fonz's favourite hangout.  The classic series set in 1950s Milwaukee - but filmed from 1974 to 1984 - made household names of it stars, including Henry Winkler as the Fonz and Ron Howard as Richie Cunningham. Molinaro came into the show in the fourth season, taking over the ownership of the drive-in from Arnold -  who was played by Karate Kid star Pat Morita. Williams is said to have found fame off of Molinaro's recommendation His character ended up marrying Chachi's mother - which also made him the Fonz's uncle - and was known for his catchphrase ""yup-yup-yup-yup"". Molinaro pulled in more fans in the UK during a run of repeats in the 1990s. The Wisconsin-born actor also appeared in spin-off  show Joanie Loves Chachi, as well as playing a simple-minded policeman in 1970s sitcom The Odd Couple. Robin Williams also has Molinaro to thank for his big break. Molinaro was taking an improv class with Williams and put his name forward when the person playing Mork dropped out of a Happy Days episode at the last minute, according to Anson Williams who played Potsie. Williams' performance as the zany alien led to hit show Mork and Mindy. Happy Days fans have been paying tribute to Molinaro. ""R.I.P. Happy Days Al Molinaro. The Buddy Holly Weezer vid is still my all time favourite music video,"" tweeted Jamie Collins. Jonathan Sothcott posted: ""Sad to read #AlMolinaro best known as Big Al from Happy Days has died. Man i loved that show."" ""RIP Al :( Thanks for those Happy Days,"" tweeted ZeN. Molinaro is survived by his second wife, Betty, his son Michael, and three grandchildren."
2015-11-01,Shaker Aamer could receive up to £1m in compensation from the British government following his release from Guantanamo Bay in Cuba.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151101042300/http://news.sky.com/story/1579264/shaker-aamer-in-line-to-receive-compensation,"By Rebecca Williams, Sky News Reporter Shaker Aamer could receive up to £1m in compensation from the British government following his release from Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. Britain's final detainee is spending his first weekend with his family in nearly 14 years after he arrived back in Britain yesterday following his release from the US prison. Mr Aamer, 46, may now pursue legal proceedings which were initiated on his behalf, against the British security services and government departments for their alleged complicity in his transfer to Guantanamo Bay, and their failure to prevent it and his ill-treatment. Referred to as detainee 239, Mr Aamer is said to be in poor health and is currently understood to be receiving medical treatment in a Harley Street clinic.  Before his release, Mr Aamer, who has four children, said his priority was to spend time with his family and the son who was born when he was in custody and is now 13. :: Read: Who Is Shaker Aamer. A Profile One of the central claims Mr Aamer has made, which could prove significantly difficult for the British government, is that a British intelligence officer was present when he was subjected to torture during interrogation in Bagram. In Britain 15 former detainees have received compensation. They include Jamal al Harith who was freed in 2004 and is now believed to be fighting for Islamic State; Moazzam Begg who was released in 2005; and Omar Deghayes - the uncle of two British jihadis who've been killed in Syria in recent years. All three received out of court settlements thought to be in the region of £1m each. :: Foreign Affairs Editor Sam Kiley: Why The UK Will Fear A Free Shaker Aamer At the time, Justice Secretary Kenneth Clark said those payments were necessary to avoid an expensive legal battle and secret intelligence details being released in court. Mr Aamer’s US lawyer, Cori Crider, told Sky News it was not a priority to pursue a case in the US and added: ""I do believe we ought to compensate people for their time. The reality is at this moment, no Guantanamo prisoner of any nationality has ever got so much as an apology from the US government. ""Now the culture of that in America is changing - a former Supreme Court justice has said in the past year that detainees held without trial and charge wrongly, just like Shaker Aamer, really ought to be given some kind of compensation."" Mr Aamer was originally detained in Afghanistan in 2001, accused of having links to al Qaeda. He was described in US military files as a ""close associate of Osama bin Laden"" who fought in the battle of Tora Bora. However, Mr Aamer says he was doing charity work.  Some insist that despite his release, Mr Aamer is a man who has had serious questions asked about his past connections and conduct. Colonel Morris Davis, former chief prosecutor for the military commissions at Guantanamo Bay, said: ""There is no guarantee that anyone that’s been released from Guantanamo won't do anything bad in the future, but it's un-American that we detain people on the slim chance that there could be some bad event in the future."""
2015-11-01,A campaign has been launched to get a new message to aliens drafted to send to the Voyager probes currently travelling billions of miles from Earth.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151101042300/http://news.sky.com/story/1579065/greetings-aliens-a-final-message-from-earth,"By Joe Tidy, Sky News Reporter A campaign has been launched to get a new message to aliens drafted to send to the Voyager probes currently travelling billions of miles from Earth. The Voyager 1 and 2 probes were launched in 1977 with a mission to explore the solar system sending back pictures of planets and their moons. Now, they are speeding towards interstellar space with one job left - to take a message from humanity as far into space as they can in the hope of encountering intelligent life. Both probes carry identical ""golden records"", which contain music, greetings, sounds and even pictures encoded onto them. Their aim is to communicate something of human culture to any extra-terrestrial civilisation. However, a team of scientists says that humans have moved on from 1977 and life is different enough on Earth to warrant an update to the almost 40-year-old snapshot of life on the planet. Christopher Riley, professor of science and media at the University of Lincoln's School of Film & Media, is launching a global public call to action on Facebook to crowd-source a short final message which he will invite NASA to send to the memory banks of the voyager probes. To make it easy to send, the final message will need to be less than 1,000 characters long (about the length of seven tweets). It would need to be beamed to the twin Voyager spacecraft before their onboard electrical power runs out in the mid-2020s. Out of power, the two probes will carry on, eventually escape the Solar System to drift through the Galaxy for another billion years. Prof Riley says: ""Before the Voyagers power down, why not add one final message from planet Earth, as a digital postscript to these most remarkable time capsules of humanity?"" The Facebook campaign will collect messages from the public, with the hope of persuading NASA to select one to send to both spacecraft before contact is lost. Prof Riley says: ""There's really no reason why a message can't be written by an impartial representative from the human race, so we're inviting suggestions from anyone who would like to contribute a thought.""  Not everyone agrees with the plan, however. Dr Anders Sandberg, a research fellow at Oxford University's Future of Humanity Institute believes the capsules should be left undisturbed. He said: ""I think it's a mistake to update the information. The Voyager probes are time capsules. They were sent off in the late 1970s and reflect the world as it was back then. ""We can't really add much to a message by adding 1,000 letters to it. But it's actually possible to destroy a message or change its meaning. ""If I send you a message and later send a: 'Ha ha, just kidding', I might actually change the meaning of what I've previously sent. I think it's not a good idea to update it - just let them go."" In response, Prof Riley said: ""There is no risk of being misunderstood or changing the meaning of the existing golden record. ""This is an opportunity to simply add a final message from humanity before we lose contact with the voyagers. ""It is a wonderful opportunity we mustn’t miss."""
2015-11-01,People from outside the European Union who turn up at accident and emergency departments face being forced to pay an upfront charge under plans being launched by Jeremy Hunt.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151101042300/http://news.sky.com/story/1579235/foreign-patients-face-emergency-healthcare-fees,"People from outside the European Union who turn up at accident and emergency departments face being forced to pay an upfront charge under plans being launched by Jeremy Hunt. Overseas patients already pay for planned hospital care - but the Health Secretary wants to extend NHS charges to A&E units. Officials stressed that no one who needs urgent care will be turned away, with systems put in place to recoup the costs, and the most vulnerable groups will be given protections. Exemptions will be put in place for refugees and asylum seekers, and pregnant women will not be turned away from maternity units if they have not paid upfront under the proposals. But patients needing other casualty department services would have to make the payment before they are treated. A Department of Health spokesman said: ""International visitors are welcome to use the NHS, provided they pay for it - just as families living in the UK do through their taxes. ""This Government was the first to introduce tough measures to clamp down on migrants accessing NHS care and have always been clear we want to look at extending charges for non-EEA migrants. ""No one will be denied urgent treatment and vulnerable groups will continue to be exempt from charging."" The crackdown on so-called health tourism is expected to claw back around £500m, according to the Times.  The NHS faces an annual £30bn shortfall in the next parliament. A basic assessment with an A&E doctor reportedly costs the NHS at least £56 while the bill rises to £316 for more extensive care. Mark Porter, chairman of the British Medication Association's governing council, told the Times: ""A doctor’s duty is to treat the patient in front of them, not to act as border guard. ""Any plans to charge migrants and short-term visitors need to be practical, economic and efficient."" A spokesman for the Royal College of Emergency Medicine told the newspaper that A&E doctors ""cannot reasonably be expected to take on the burden on identifying who is eligible for free treatment, and who should be charged"". The plans are expected to go out to consultation next month."
2015-11-01,"A transgender woman who complained she was being harassed by inmates at her all-male jail has been moved to a female jail, say Sky sources.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151101042300/http://news.sky.com/story/1578998/transgender-tara-hudson-moved-to-female-jail,"A transgender woman who complained she was being harassed by inmates at her all-male jail has been moved to a female jail, say Sky sources. Tara Hudson, 26, had admitted headbutting a bar manager during a pub fight that took place on Boxing Day and last week she was jailed for 12 weeks as punishment. Hudson, who is still legally a man but has lived as a woman all her adult life and gone through six years of gender reconstruction surgery, complained she was being harassed by other inmates at the all-male prison she was sent to. More than 125,000 people signed a petition supporting her bid to be moved to another prison. Tara Hudson was jailed for 12 weeks. Pic: Change.org She is now believed to have been moved to Eastwood Park Prison in Gloucester, a jail that holds around 360 women. Ben Howlett, MP for Bath and a member of the Women and Equalities Select Committee, said: ""This afternoon we have heard from a source that Tara has been taken from court to an all-female prison. ""We will be pressing the Ministry of Justice for a formal line following this and work to ensure there is no repeat of this situation in future."" The move comes just hours after Hudson lost an appeal against her sentence, which was heard at Bristol Crown Court by a panel of three judges, headed by Recorder of Bristol Llewelyn Sellick. Hudson's barrister Nicholas Wragg said his client, who suffers from mental illness, had been separated from the rest of the prison population and ""locked in a cell 23 hours a day"" at HMP Horfield, which holds around 600 men. He added: ""The clang of a prison door should never be pleasant - it should have a sobering effect on a person. ""But Ms Hudson has had an awful time - she has found it unrelenting and frightening."" He said she had even been taunted as she left prison to come to court by other inmates shouting ""Tara, Tara, show us your t***"". :: As It Happened: Tara Hudson's Appeal Against The Sentence That Saw Her Put In A Male Prison The court heard that a very drunk Hudson had headbutted bar manager Christopher Dyer after he refused to sell her any more alcohol, leaving Mr Dyer with injuries that required £1,500 of dental surgery. Hudson, who has eight previous convictions including offences for battery, had initially said the attack was in self defence but then changed her plea to one of guilty on the day of the trial. Recorder Sellick said the appeal was dismissed after it was ruled that Hudson had a ""worrying criminal record"" and that the bar assault had breached a conditional discharge given just three weeks earlier. He had, however, said consideration needed to be given as to where Hudson served her sentence, adding: ""It is for the prison service and not the court to establish where a sentence should be served. ""We would invite further and sensitive consideration of these issues."" A Prison Service spokesman said: ""It is longstanding policy to place offenders according to their legally recognised gender. ""However, our guidelines allow room for discretion and, in such cases, medical experts will review the circumstances in order to protect the emotional wellbeing of the person concerned. ""Our top priority is the safety and welfare of those in our custody and decisions relating to the location of transgender prisoners are taken by a range of people including psychologists, healthcare professionals and prison staff."""

The fire unfolded at a Halloween party at the Colectiv club, and up to 400 young revellers were packed into the building's basement. It is believed that pyrotechnics used during a live rock concert inside the venue misfired because they were poorly fitted. The spark ignited an acoustic pillar cased in polystyrene, causing fire to spread to the ceiling and the club to fill up with smoke. There was only one emergency exit available, and many revellers did not immediately react because they thought the flames were part of the show. Gallery: Reveller's Picture Shows The Firework Which Set The Club Ablaze A Facebook picture shows the firework spark which set a polystyrene pillar alight. Pic: Facebook/Vlad Bușcă ""It took two or three seconds to ignite the whole roof,"" Alexandru Alexe told Sky News. The social activist alleged that ""valuable time was lost"" as firefighters entered the burning building from the wrong entrance - and also claimed ambulance crews took 30 minutes to arrive after the first emergency call was made. Teenagers as young as 14 were inside the club when the fire began, and have been treated by specialists. Overnight, 155 people were being cared for across 10 hospitals - and at one treatment centre, 14 patients are in a critical condition. Another hospital has nine people in a serious condition, while a third facility has three people in intensive care who suffered severe burns. The drummer and bassist of the band on stage are among those seriously hurt, it has been reported. Romanian prime minister Victor Ponta has decreed three days of mourning. One woman inside the club told Romanian TV there was fire ""all over the place"", adding: ""I saw people changing their mood from happiness to deep panic."" Sixty ambulances and fire engines were at the scene, and some victims were being resuscitated on the street outside. An Interior Ministry spokesman has warned the death toll is likely to rise, and many victims are yet to be identified. ""We have many people with burns, intoxicated with smoke and people squashed,"" Raed Arafat added. One eyewitness said there was a stampede of people running out of the club after the fire, in one of Bucharest's worst incidents for decades. Another added: ""People were fainting from the smoke. It was total chaos, people were trampling on each other."" The country's president, Klaus Iohannis, has expressed his ""complete sympathy and solidarity with the families of those affected"". Prime Minister Victor Ponta is cutting short a visit to Mexico and flying home in light of the tragedy. An investigation into the incident has begun, and an emergency meeting of cabinet ministers is taking place this morning. The owner of the nightclub is helping police with their inquiries."

The bank took to its @BarclaysUKHelp Twitter account on Friday afternoon to admit: ""Some customers are experiencing technical issues affecting our website, mobile banking & debit card usage. We're urgently investigating this."" Barclays was responding to a growing number of complaints via social media but it is not known how widespread the issues were felt. One customer, Gary Lodge, tweeted: ""@BarclaysUKHelp @BarclaysUK how long is this gonna take i'm stuck and cannot get home. This needs to be sorted."" The bank later said that the problems had been resolved. ""We can confirm that customer services are now recovering from a technical issue we experienced this afternoon impacting some of our customers. ""The problems have been resolved but we are closely monitoring the situation."" The UK banking system in no stranger to service outages - leaving customers without access to their money. Mobile services have been particularly vulnerable to high traffic volumes on pay days. The last major problem was in June when RBS mislaid 600,000 overnight transactions because of a technical issue. Banks can be fined for serious service disruptions by regulators, who have urged the industry to invest more in their IT infrastructure to bolster its resilience."
2015-11-01,David Cameron has warned the House of Lords he will be reviewing the power wielded by peers in the wake of the double defeat on tax credit cuts.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151101042300/http://news.sky.com/story/1576861/what-now-for-the-house-of-lords,"David Cameron has warned the House of Lords he will be reviewing the power wielded by peers in the wake of the double defeat on tax credit cuts. But what does it all mean? We answer some of the key questions about the upper chamber. :: So the Lords didn't agree with the Commons, what's the problem? Isn't that their job? The House of Lords is supposed to hold the Government to account - a bit Well yes, and no. It is the job of peers in the upper chamber to scrutinise Government policy and to provide checks and balances. But there are rules about what they can tinker with. We say rules but actually we mean conventions, which are more flexible than rules. Like moveable goalposts. :: And by voting against tax credits they broke a rule? They broke a convention – or at least that's what the Government says. There is a convention that dates back to the 17th century and says the House of Commons has the final say on financial matters. Since 1911, the House of Lords has not been allowed to overturn a Commons finance vote. David Cameron says the vote delaying tax credit cuts and demanding alterations to the way they are administered broke the convention. But it's a grey area. The cuts were not part of the Finance Bill because they were not in the Conservative manifesto – they were introduced in July's Budget. It means the Government has tried to get it through the House of Lords using a ""statutory instrument"" - not primary finance legislation. Peers say that meant they could vote against it - though do admit it does relate to the financial running of the country. :: What exactly is a statutory instrument? Know your instruments It's like a big brass trumpet ... Actually it's nothing like that. A statutory instrument allows ministers to push reforms through without having to include them in a bill. There is a feeling statutory instruments get less scrutiny than a bill. The Lords have killed off five statutory instruments supported by the Government since 1945 – in 1968, twice in 2000, 2007 and 2012. :: What is the problem with the Lords overturning Commons decisions? The ""elected"" House of Commons The upper chamber is unelected and therefore does not reflect the will of the people in the way the Commons does. In this case, peers have argued that MPs were not reflecting the will of the people because the Conservatives refused to spell out the details of the £12bn welfare cuts they proposed before the election.  David Cameron was pressed on it. Repeatedly. In fact in a Question Time special he said that child tax credits would not fall. Peers say in this case, therefore, the Lords is more reflective of the public view than the Government – a recent Sky Data poll showed half the public opposed the cuts, only 31% supported them. And remember the Lords is there to hold the Government to account. It inflicted 99 defeats on the Coalition government. :: What is the Government going to do about it? Peers stopped from meddling with the nation's finances? Calls for House of Lords reform have been numerous – there are 826 peers compared to 650 elected MPs, which seems an extraordinary expense. But, until now, Mr Cameron has had little appetite for tackling the problem. (He forced Nick Clegg to shelve plans to reform the upper chamber in 2012). Actually, he has created peers at a faster rate than any other Prime Minister since life peerages began in 1958. In the wake of the tax credit cuts vote though, Mr Cameron has promised/threatened a ""rapid review"" of powers. He will basically look at how the rules/conventions can be tightened to make very sure the Lords cannot monkey with finance matters again. He has also threatened to flood the Lords with Conservative peers – the reason the Government was dished defeat was because there is not a Tory majority in the upper chamber. This would be unpopular though. :: Is he really going to pick a fight with the Lords? Ding, ding It is unlikely the PM, or the Chancellor, has much of an appetite for a proper scrap. There are suggestions the ""rapid review"" threat is a distraction from the main event – Mr Osborne and what he's going to do about tax credits. (To be revealed in the Autumn Statement at the end of November). There is a deep irony that the Lords, associated with privilege and wealth as it is, has become the champion of the working people and that it is a Conservative PM who has now has the job of dealing with peers.

The Metropolitan Police said the man from Lambeth was detained on Thursday and remains in custody. Officers are continuing to appeal for witnesses and information following the assaults in the Clapham and Brixton Hill area. The attacks have targeted lone women late at night in residential areas and all victims were aged in their 20s and 30s. Superintendent Rob Applegarth, of Lambeth borough, said: ""We are aware of eight assaults which we are linking at this early stage. ""We have increased police patrols in Clapham and Brixton Hill and urge women to think of their personal safety."" Another man was arrested and then released on bail on Wednesday but police were still looking for other people. The first incident happened on Clitheroe Road at about 11.30pm on 9 October when a 23-year-old woman was grabbed and sexually assaulted. She managed to raise the alarm and the suspect ran off. Nearly two hours later, a 30-year-old woman was approached by a man as she walked along Deauville Court. She asked him to leave her alone but was assaulted before he walked away. On 22 October, a 32-year-old walking along Trent Road at about 9pm was followed and assaulted. Four days later, a 35-year-old woman was grabbed from behind as she walked home along Arodene Road at about 7pm. Less than an hour afterwards, a 26-year-old woman was attacked on the doorstep of her home on nearby Rosebery Road - and the CCTV video released shows her being assaulted as she tried to get inside. Later that same evening, a man exposed himself to a 28-year-old woman as she arrived at her house. The two most recent attacks happened on 28 October. The first saw another 28-year-old woman grabbed by a man as she walked home on Southall Road. She screamed and he fled. Then, three hours later, a 31-year-old woman was walking home when a man forced her into a block off flats on Sudbourne Road. The man sexually assaulted her and ran off. Anyone who has any information or witnesses should to call the MPS on the police non-emergency line on 101."

A lack of trust in Mr Miliband and Mr Balls to run the economy was cited as a primary reason for Labour’s loss at the general election in May. Polls consistently showed them lagging David Cameron and George Osborne on the issue. But in a new Sky poll, 30% said they would prefer the Miliband/Balls combo as PM and chancellor, compared to 23% for Mr Corbyn and Mr McDonnell. Among just Labour voters the results were closer, but Mr Miliband and Mr Balls were still narrowly preferred to Mr Corbyn and Mr McDonnell - 39% to 37%. Meanwhile, Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne are strongly preferred to their Labour counterparts to run the UK economy. Half of Britons would back the Cameron/Osborne combo, compared with just 22% for Mr Corbyn and Mr McDonnell. And as Mr Corbyn speaks at the Scottish Labour Conference, more Scots would also back Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne - 29% to 22%. The Conservatives, as a party, are also backed over Labour as the best party for the UK economy - 50% to 24%. Sky Data political analyst Harry Carr said: ""While some of Jeremy Corbyn's specific economic policies are popular, he is not trusted with the economy at a more general level. ""Public mistrust in Ed Miliband’s economic credibility dogged him throughout the 2015 general election campaign. ""Electoral precedent suggests it is unlikely Mr Corbyn will win in 2020 unless he can win back that trust."" Looking further back, Mr Corbyn also comes off worse in comparison with Tony Blair, who was highly critical of Mr Corbyn during the Labour leadership election campaign. The pairing of Mr Blair and Gordon Brown were preferred on the economy by 48% of Britons, compared to 16% for Mr Corbyn and Mr McDonnell.

Harry Clarke had been due to face a Glasgow City Council disciplinary panel after evidence emerged that he had lied on job applications and concealed a history of blackouts whilst driving. A spokesman for the local authority said: ""Harry Clarke has resigned with immediate effect and is no longer an employee of Glasgow City Council."" A previous hearing planned for September was postponed because Mr Clarke was unwell. A fatal accident inquiry (FAI) into the bin lorry crash heard Mr Clarke, 58, lost consciousness at the wheel of the council vehicle on 22 December last year.

2015-11-01,Moscow has played down an Islamic State-linked group's reported claim that it downed a Russian passenger jet in Egypt's Sinai peninsula.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151101042300/http://news.sky.com/story/1579327/devastation-at-egypt-jet-crash-site-as-224-killed,"Moscow has played down an Islamic State-linked group's reported claim that it downed a Russian passenger jet in Egypt's Sinai peninsula. The Airbus A321 crashed into a mountainous area shortly after losing radar contact near cruising altitude, with all 224 passengers and crew thought to have been killed. A statement attributed to the Wilayat Sinai (Sinai Province) group said: ""The fighters of the Islamic State were able to down a Russian plane over Sinai province that was carrying over 220 Russian crusaders. They were all killed, thanks be to God."" The statement was circulated on Twitter and also posted on the Aamaq website, which acts as a semi-official news agency for IS. Egypt's prime minister tours the site of the wreckage However, security sources in Egypt said an initial examination suggests the plane suffered a technical fault. Russia's transport minister also urged caution, telling the Interfax news agency the claims ""can't be considered accurate"". It is unclear whether militants in the region would have the capability to attack the plane, which was flying at around 31,000ft.  The Airbus A321, operated by Russian airline Metrojet, took off from Sharm el-Sheikh shortly before 6am local time, bound for St Petersburg. It disappeared from radar some 23 minutes into the flight. Data shows it was plunging 6000ft per minute before it lost contact. The plane was found in the Hassana region, 22 miles (35km) south of Arish. There were 214 Russians on board, three Ukrainians and seven crew members. Authorities say no one survived - despite earlier reports that voices had been heard from the wreckage. At least 150 bodies, many of whom were still strapped to their seats, have been recovered so far, including five children. German airline Lufthansa and Air France have halted flights over the Sinai peninsula until further notice. Gallery: Scenes Of Devastation At Metrojet Crash Site As 224 Perish Egypt's Prime Minister Sherif Ismail looks at the wreckage of the Metrojet airliner that crashed in a mountainous area of the Sinai peninsula, killing all 224 on board There are ""a lot of dead on the ground and many who died whilst strapped to their seats,"" an Egyptian official told news agency Reuters. He said the plane was split into two parts, ""a small part on the tail end that burned and a larger part that crashed into a rock"". Rescuers have found both black boxes, which could give vital clues about what happened. In a statement, Metrojet named the pilot as Valery Nemov and said he had 12,000 hours' flying experience, including 3,860 hours in the A321. It also said the aircraft had received factory maintenance in 2014. Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced a national day of mourning on Sunday and the country's top investigative body, the Investigative Committee, is looking into the incident. And Britain's Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond, has expressed his sympathies to his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov. ""The British people who know and love Sharm el-Sheikh will be especially sad that what should have been a happy holiday trip has ended in such tragedy for so many families,"" he said after their phone call. Airbus said the plane was produced in 1997 and had accumulated some 56,000 flight hours in nearly 21,000 flights.  :: What Caused KGL-9268 To Plunge From The Sky? According to Egyptian media, the pilot reported a technical failure shortly after take off and requested to land at a nearby airport, Sky's Middle East correspondent Sherine Tadros said. But Mike Vivian, former head of flight operations at the Civil Aviation Authority, told Sky News ""hostile action"" should not be ruled out. ""I am absolutely certain that will be one of the focuses of investigators on the ground,"" he said. Egypt's North Sinai is home to a two-year-old Islamist insurgency and militants linked to IS have killed hundreds of soldiers and also attacked Western targets in recent months. Several hundred relatives gathered at Pulkovo airport near St Petersburg after the crash, but many have now been taken to a nearby hotel. Sky's Moscow correspondent John Sparks says authorities have so far given relatives very little information. One woman at the airport, Yulia Zaitseva, said her friends, a newlywed couple, were on the flight. ""We were friends for 20 years, "" said Ms Zaitseva. ""She was a very good friend who was ready to give everything to other people. To lose such a friend is like having your hand cut off."""
2015-11-04,"Cancer research in England could be made to take a step back after patients are denied a potentially life-extending drug on the NHS, according to a leading oncologist.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151104144143/http://news.sky.com/story/1581324/cutting-cancer-drugs-could-hamper-research,"By Frazer Maude, Sky News Reporter Cancer research in England could be made to take a step back after patients are denied a potentially life-extending drug on the NHS, according to a leading oncologist. From Wednesday, up to 16 medicines will be delisted by NHS England from the NHS-financed Cancer Drugs Fund, meaning they will not be available to patients who have not already been prescribed them. Some of the delisted drugs were being used in treatments for bowel cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer and leukaemia. Danielle Corcoran Tanner has a rare form of pancreatic cancer Amongst them is the pancreatic cancer drug nab-paclitaxel, marketed by Celgene as Abraxane. Its makers say it costs around £8,000 per year for each patient, and research suggests that, when used with gemcitabine, it could prolong life in terminally ill patients by up to two months. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published their recommendation last year that Abraxane should not be funded by the NHS. Commenting on that guidance, NICE chief executive Sir Andrew Dillon said: ""Unfortunately the development of new treatments for pancreatic cancer has been very limited in recent years. ""Although a number of newer treatments including nab-paclitaxel have been introduced, we are disappointed that, when considering the impact of side effects as well as how effective the treatment is, the evidence fails to show that it works any better for patients than other treatments already provided by the NHS. It is also more expensive."" Some oncologists, like Professor Juan Valle at The Christie in Manchester, say that not being able to prescribe nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane) could hamper cancer research. ""One of the things about the UK is that we have been very much involved in clinical trials aimed at improving treatments for patients with pancreatic cancer,"" he said. ""The next generation of trials are likely to add on to this established combination (nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine), which is now considered one of the global standards of care. ""The fact that in England we won't be able to do that means effectively we are taking a step back rather than being able to build on that and move forward."" The decision has angered cancer charities too. Ali Stunt, chief executive at Pancreatic Cancer Action, said: ""Clearly the assessment criteria is failing abysmally if NHS England are unable to consider the unmet need for pancreatic cancer patients, the extremely limited treatment options currently available for pancreatic cancer, and the real-world benefit that this drug has for patients themselves in terms of both extension and quality of life."" According to the charity, pancreatic cancer is the UK's fifth biggest cancer killer with the lowest survival rate of all 22 common cancers. Almost 9,000 people are diagnosed with the disease each year, and they are faced with an average survival rate of just four to six months. Danielle Corcoran Tanner is a 28-year-old mother who has a rare form of pancreatic cancer, but currently is not using Abraxane. Now that the drug has been removed from the fund, she says if her tumour becomes more aggressive, she will not be able to afford to pay for it. ""Although it's not a cure, it gives people longer with their family, and it's hard to know that that’s been taken away,"" she said. ""It might only give you an extra two months, but that's two months more that people could spend with their children, with their mums, their brothers, their sisters. It's hard to put a value on what that's worth to people."""

The first ever animated Disney character is set to be a star again as one of his films has been rediscovered 87 years after it was made. Sleigh Bells, a six-minute animation, was found by a researcher browsing the online database of the British Film Institute's archive. Walt Disney with his later creation Mickey Mouse The ""exciting discovery"" is thought to be the sole surviving print for the 1928 film, according to the BFI. ""A number of other (Oswald) films do survive but Sleigh Bells has been, until now, a lost film, unseen since its original release,"" the BFI said. Walt Disney Animation Studios used the print to make a new master print and digital copies of Sleigh Bells. A fully restored version will be shown next month in London as part of a Christmas programme including other Disney shorts from the 1930s to the present day. Walt Disney and his long-time collaborator Ub Iwerks first drew the animations for Oswald in 1927 for Universal Studios. He was widely loved for his ""mischievous and rebellious personality"", the BFI said. But he was soon usurped by Mickey, now Disney's most famous personality. Gallery: Disney Drawings Seen For First Time A drawing of Mickey Mouse dating back to 1933. It was among original pencil drawings to go on display for the first time in January 2013. Disney and Iwerks were forced to abandon Oswald when they left Universal after a dispute with the studio. They invented Mickey in 1928 and his long-eared precursor eventually fell into obscurity. Robin Baker, head curator at the BFI National Archive, said: ""What a joyful treat to discover a long-lost Walt Disney film in the BFI National Archive and to be able to show Sleigh Bells to a whole new audience 87 years after it was made. ""The restoration of this film will introduce many audiences to Disney's work in the silent period - it clearly demonstrates the vitality and imagination of his animation at a key point in his early career."" Andrew Millstein, president of the Disney animation studios, said the company was ""thrilled to be collaborating with the BFI National Archives in the restoration of the 'lost' Oswald short""."

The retailer announced a 1.2% drop in like-for-like sales in its general merchandise business over the 26 weeks to 26 September. It said that while its decision to maintain clothing margins in its second quarter damaged sales, underlying - or trading - profits rose 6% over the first half as a result. However, it reported a pre-tax profit of £216m for the period - down 23% on the same period last year - reflecting store improvement programme costs and some store closures. M&S said trading conditions were tough as rivals slashed prices to shift seasonal stock in late summer because of cooler, wetter weather. M&S said its food business outperformed the UK market - with like-for-like sales rising 0.2% while its website sales rose 34.2% despite recent technical difficulties which M&S blamed on an internal error. Chief executive Marc Bolland said: ""We delivered good underlying profit growth in the first half and made strong progress against our key priorities. Our food business again outperformed the market by over 3% points as our focus on quality and innovation continues to set us apart. ""In general merchandise we decided to improve profitability by focusing on gross margin, delivering another significant increase, which in part resulted in slightly lower sales. ""As a consequence of good performance and strong cash generation we have decided to increase our dividend."" M&S said that while it saw some improvement in consumer confidence, market conditions continued to be ""challenging"" in both the UK and international markets. ""Our short term priorities remain the same: Food sales growth, general merchandise gross margin improvement, improved general merchandise performance and strong cash generation,"" it added. On the question of whether M&S planned to join some other retailers in warning of selected price increases to take account of the National Living Wage next year, the company confirmed it was already paying its permanent customer assistants more than the £7.20 hourly rate. The company's share price, which has risen by more than 30% over the past 12 months, was up by 3% in early trading on the FTSE 100 on Wednesday."

But the fine has only been waived for individuals and small businesses who have a ""good reason for sending it in late"". An HMRC spokesman told Sky News it wants to use more of its resources to target major tax avoiders rather than ""penalising ordinary people"". The story was first reported by the Daily Telegraph after it obtained a leaked memo, and could affect nearly 900,000 people. The memo reveals that staff were asked to write off the fine without further investigation for those who could show mitigating circumstances. ""Our penalty regime is intended to influence customer behaviour, but also be clear and cost-effective, fair and proportionate,"" it said. ""The current way of managing penalties does not meet these objectives, and so we have decided to take a more proportionate approach where a customer has filed their return late, and then appealed against their penalty. ""This means that in the vast majority of cases we will be accepting the customer's grounds for appeal, and we can cancel the penalty."" A total of 890,000 people reportedly missed the 31 January deadline for completing self-assessment forms. An HMRC spokesman told Sky News: ""We've been clear we want to focus more and more of our resources on investigating major tax avoidance and evasion rather than penalising ordinary people who are trying to do the right thing. ""But no one will be let off the fine unless they've now sent in their return and have a good reason for sending it in late. ""This is part of our planned approach to penalty appeals, particularly for small businesses and individuals who have sent their tax return in late."" On HMRC's website it states that a reasonable excuse for missing the deadline is ""normally something unexpected or outside your control that stopped you meeting a tax obligation"". This includes the recent death of a partner, an unexpected stay in hospital, computer failures, service issues with HMRC's online services, a fire which prevented the completion of a tax return or postal delays."

Amid the backlash, one of her colleagues showed his support for her stance. Mark Urwin tweeted: ""She is pointing out how alcohol is seen as an everyday product and not the dangerous drug it is if not respected."" Sergeant Unwin prompted Ross Carter to tweet: ""Surely the abilities of parents, teachers & society to teach alcohol's dangers aren't at all affected by a crisp's flavour?"" Aldi responded to PC McNaney's complaint, saying: ""We're very sorry to hear you feel this way, and we'll be sure to pass your feedback onto the relevant department."" It said the crisps were part of their ""exciting"" Christmas range. PC McNaney, who tweets as @AlcoHarmCop, works for Durham Police's Alcohol Harm Reduction Unit."

One of the officials, who both spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to talk about the information publicly, said they had ruled out a missile strike as a possible cause because neither a launch nor an engine burn had been detected. They said the infrared activity could mean many things, including that there was a bomb on board or that an engine exploded because of a malfunction. Aviation analyst Paul Beaver said the heat detected ""indicates that there was a catastrophic explosion or disintegration of the airplane"", but does not reveal what caused it.  Some experts have suggested a bomb was the most likely cause of the crash, while others have pointed to a 2001 incident in which the Metrojet plane damaged its tail during landing. Militants from the Islamic State-linked Sinai Province have claimed responsibility, but the group has not provided further evidence and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al Sisi has dismissed the claim as ""propaganda"". It comes as investigators prepare to start examining the black boxes retrieved from the crash site in the Sinai Peninsula. The Russian aircraft's cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder are expected to shed light on what caused Flight KGL-9268, which was travelling from Sharm el-Sheikh to the Russian city of St Petersburg on Saturday, to break up near cruising altitude. Gallery: Russian Plane Crash In Egypt Investigated Luggage and other belongings of passengers from a crashed Russian plane are pictured at the site of the disaster in Egypt Egypt's Civil Aviation Minister Hossam Kamal said a committee of international investigators will conclude its field inspection at the crash site on Tuesday before starting work on the black boxes. Mr Kamal said it would ""take some time"" to produce the final report and that the committee ""has all the tools and experts to deal with the investigation"". Bosses from Russian airline Kogalymavia, which owns the Metrojet brand, have insisted only ""some kind of impact"" could have caused the disaster. Egypt's civil aviation ministry said on Tuesday there were no facts at this stage to substantiate assertions that the plane broke up in mid-air. Spokesman Mohamed Rahmi confirmed that no distress call was received before the plane went down.

Domestic mobile and broadband providers will be obliged to assist authorities with gathering the data. Ministers are also proposing that senior judges will be allowed to block operations to intercept communications. Seven High Court judges will be appointed as judicial commissioners in a new ""double lock"" approval system for more intrusive capabilities. They will have the power to veto warrants signed by Secretaries of State. If an MP's web history is looked at, the Prime Minister will be informed. Home Secretary Theresa May said the publication of the bill is ""a decisive moment"". She said: ""Never before has so much information been in the public domain about the activities of our police and security services, as well as the oversight, safeguard and authorisation arrangements which govern them. ""I am clear we need to update our legislation to ensure it is modern, fit for purpose and can respond to emerging threats as technology advances. ""There should be no area of cyberspace which is a haven for those who seek to harm us to plot, poison minds and peddle hatred under the radar. ""But I am also clear that the exercise and scope of investigatory powers should be clearly set out and subject to stringent safeguards and robust oversight.""

Arriving on a black Air New Zealand plane, the team was treated to a rendition of the Maori war dance by ground crews wearing hi-vis jackets. Inside the airport 4,000 black-clad fans, some of whom had camped out overnight, packed the arrivals hall to greet them. Flanked by coach Steve Hansen, Captain Richie McCaw walked in with the Web Ellis Cup tucked under one arm, 72 hours after his team clinched the world title. ""The support's been amazing, so to bring this back is pretty awesome,"" McCaw said. Hansen added: ""It's not too bad is it. We're starting to get used to having it around."" Fresh from winning World Rugby's player of the year, Dan Carter called the reception a ""dream-homecoming"". The flyhalf is one of seven squad members who have confirmed their retirement from international rugby, making the team's three-day journey around the country a valedictory tour. McCaw has yet to confirm whether or not he will be retiring after a record 148 tests for New Zealand. New Zealand are the first team to win the World Cup three times and the first to retain the trophy after their 34-17 victory over neighbours Australia at Twickenham last Saturday."

Palestinian-born Janan Harb, 68, was told she had the right to more than £15m and the value of two London properties. Ms Harb said she secretly married the king - who ruled from 1982 to 2005 - in 1968 when he was still a prince and the country's interior minister. She was just 19 at the time and the royal family opposed the marriage because she was from a Christian family, she said. Ms Harb was sent away from Saudi Arabia in 1970 when the family ""wrongly"" blamed her for King Fahd's methadone addiction, she added. King Fahd ruled until 2005 She told the court how she had been staying at the Dorchester Hotel in June 2003 when she was approached by Prince Abdul Aziz, the son of another of the king's wives, who promised her financial security. At the time of the meeting, the then-king was seriously ill and Ms Harb said Prince Abdul agreed to pay her £12m and transfer two flats in the prestigious Cheyne Walk part of Chelsea to her ownership, thereby fulfilling his father's wishes. The prince subsequently failed to honour the agreement and wrote to the court denying the claim. However, Chancery Division judge Mr Justice Peter Smith sided with Ms Harb after the prince failed to attend court to give his side of the story, arguing that current monarch King Salman and his family thought attendance would create ""a media circus"". Prince Abdul Aziz said he had not agreed a deal After the ruling, Ms Harb said: ""This has been 12 years of misery for me. I am very happy with British justice. ""Thank God we have British justice. The prince wanted me to go to Saudi Arabia where he would had power over all this. ""I am very relieved. I only wish he could have honoured his father's wishes ... he is being very mean.

The actor, who was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease three months before he took his life, was showing symptoms including stiffness, slumping gait and confusion, Susan Williams told ABC's Good Morning America. She said a post-mortem examination found Williams also had Lewy body dementia, which causes a progressive decline in mental abilities. The star of films such as Good Morning, Vietnam and Dead Poets Society died aged 63 at his home in August 2014. In her first interview since his death, Mrs Williams said the Oscar-winning actor never talked about taking his own life. Gallery: Robin Williams: Life In Pictures Hollywood actor Robin Williams died at the age of 63 She said Williams was trying to keep it together, but ""in the last month he could not. It was like the dam broke"". ""If Robin was lucky, he would've had maybe three years left,"" she told ABC, referring to a doctor's prognosis. ""And they would've been hard years. And it's a good chance he would've been locked up."" Mrs Williams said the actor's chronic depression, which he battled throughout a lifetime struggle with addiction, also returned. She said Williams had agreed to undergo a battery of neurological tests the week before he committed suicide. Through tears, Mrs Williams also described racing home after Williams' body was discovered by an assistant. ""I just wanted to see my husband,"" she said. ""And I got to see him ... and I got to pray with him. ""And I got to tell him: 'I forgive you 50 billion per cent, with all my heart'.""

Police and security services will be able to access that data - which will include all the sites a person visits, but not the individual pages within that site - without a warrant. The new draft Investigatory Powers Bill is an attempt to bring many different surveillance powers of the security services and police under one comprehensive piece of legislation. It will be examined by both Houses of Parliament before voting on the final version of the bill in 2016. Chris Phillips, the former head of the National Counter Terrorism Security Office, told Sky News: ""The world has moved on so quickly: people communicate on many different means, whether it’s WhatsApp, whether it's Facebook, whether it's email or telephone. ""So it's really important that the laws keep up. [Without new laws] we'd be in a very dangerous place."" Plans to access browsing histories rely on classing this information as 'communications data' rather than 'content'. Communications data is the who, where and when of a message - everything that might be written on an envelope or found on an itemised phone bill. Content is the what: the letter inside the envelope or the phone call itself. Accessing content currently requires a warrant; accessing data does not. Other contentious parts of the bill will include whether politicians or judges should sign off warrants to access the content of communications, such as emails, phone calls and text messages. Warrants will also be under examination in relation to GCHQ. Its bulk interception programmes - which scoop up billions of communications each day, including both metadata and content - depend on warrants. Their scope could be more closely restricted. GCHQ's legal power to hack into people's computers - only acknowledged this year and called 'equipment interference' - is also covered by warrant. Alice Wyss, a researcher for Amnesty UK, told Sky News: ""Indiscriminate mass surveillance is a real concern. It's a violation of people's right to privacy. ""This new bill … has the possibility that it will allow an unlawful, mass program of collecting our data to continue unabated."" Government plans on encryption will also be closely watched. Many companies, including Apple and WhatsApp, offer some form of full 'end-to-end' encryption, which locks messages in a way that even the Silicon Valley companies themselves are technically unable to unscramble. The UK Government currently has the legal power to compel a company to provide 'content in the clear'. However, this power has never been tested in law and could be contentious if retained in the new bill. Technology companies say that full encryption is the only way to keep consumers safe from hacks like the one suffered by TalkTalk. Lord Carlile, the former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation and a Liberal Democrat peer, told Sky News: ""It is a significant and formidable bill which will enable the authorities to catch serious and organised criminals and terrorists and to protect the public. ""I think the protections that are built into it should satisfy any reasonable person."" :: You can watch a special report on new surveillance laws on Sky News at 2.30pm, 4.30pm and 8.30pm."
2015-11-04,The Home Secretary Theresa May is pushing for a major overhaul of online surveillance laws. Here's what you need to know.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151104144143/http://news.sky.com/story/1581425/web-surveillance-what-you-need-to-know,"The Home Secretary Theresa May is pushing for a major overhaul of online surveillance laws. Here's what you need to know. What will be recorded under the new law? The Draft Investigatory Powers Bill will require internet firms to record the internet browsing history of every person in the UK for a year. Who will be able to access this? The police and security services. So everything I do online will be recorded? Not quite. The websites you visit will be recorded, but not the individual pages within that site. So SkyNews.com would be recorded, but not that you're reading this specific story on our site. They'll also be able to see which apps you used on your phone or tablet, and when. Will councils be allowed to access your internet history? No. The government says local authorities will not get access to the data. It says another safeguard will be the introduction of a new offence of misusing the data, carrying a two-year prison sentence. What if the police or security services want even more detailed data? They can request to have your detailed web browsing history recorded and handed over, but this requires the Home Secretary's approval. Can the government access encrypted communications? Chat apps like WhatsApp and Apple’s iMessage use end-to-end encryption, a form of security which means even the companies themselves cannot see user communications. The government is lobbying firms directly for back-door access to these apps, but it is difficult to see how it could force companies like US-based Apple to comply. David Cameron promised to outlaw end-to-end encryption earlier this year, but it didn't happen. Who are the new laws aimed at? The government says terrorists and serious criminals are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and that some sites have become ""safe havens"" for them. Why is this bill being proposed now? Current laws on online surveillance were drafted 15 years ago when the web was a very different place. The existing legislation is complicated and has a number of grey areas. The Lib Dems blocked a similar bill in coalition and put a temporary measure in place for two years, which is now running out."

Since coming out of prison on licence, he says he has been reformed and is sorry for the distress he caused victims. When did you convert to Islam and how? I converted about five years ago after meeting a few Muslims, I was friends with a few Muslims before, but they weren't really practising. Then I met more religious Muslims and they started speaking about Islam and after a process I became a Muslim. What led you personally to convert? A lot of people want to give reasons why I did things. They want to find a gap or a void in my life, 'he did this because of that' but I don't buy into those things. I know why I did it because I was convinced on a personal level that this was my religion. It did come from the environment I was in and from the friends I was keeping but it didn't come from a void in my life. There are many other things people can do to fill voids in their life. What were you like before? I wasn't well behaved. I was somebody engaged in smoking drugs, smoking cannabis, drinking alcohol and going clubbing, all of those things and I was happy with them. I wasn't disappointed. I didn't feel like I was missing something in my life. I felt complete and fulfilled but when Islam came to me and was presented to me my heart inclined towards it. You became radicalised, was this a gradual process? It was in terms of the end process, to committing crime from the bit at the beginning of just praying. My belief become stronger and more convicted that what I was doing was correct and was according to Islam. Through the internet, lectures online, reading certain books, and learning from certain individuals - all of that collectively, the way it affected me was it convinced me to go out in public and do these things as a propagation of my faith. So the internet played a part for you? Yeah of course - because I would search for certain lectures online and look at the videos of notorious individuals. I would listen to a lot of lectures and then move on to more political issues like foreign policy and Islam, jihad and all of this stuff. That's when I sort of took them lectures which were very specific and I made it generalised and then I sort of implemented that understanding on wider society. You started working with Usman Raja from the Unity Initiative over a year ago. Were you initially sceptical about Usman and his work? I first met Usman on my release from custody, my first sentence for the ""Muslim Patrol"" case and I met him through probation. I was very sceptical of what he was doing because he came through the probation service - so the same justice system that I'd dealt with and the same people that had put me in prison.So I thought: what benefit could he give to me? The Unity Initiative talks about linguistics and that oral tradition of Islam - take me through how that teaching changed you? When he approached me with these teachings all I had to do was basic research to understand that Islam is taught like this and the majority of Muslims don't believe what I did was correct. I had to judge myself and question myself and ask: 'Is what I'm doing correct?' In prison I really had time to think and reflect. I was meeting Usman on legal visits once a week and all of that combined made me start to understand. I sort of started to understand the wider aspect of my religion, not just what I had taken for myself. What would you say to other young men who may be being swayed as we speak towards a more radical way of thinking? I'm on my own journey so I can't give a generalised statement to the masses to live your life the way I'm living my life. I can say I experienced these things and I've done certain things in my life which I'm not proud of. I would say look to what Islam teaches you, the mainstream Muslims, and you will find your answers from the scholars and from people who understand the religion and don't just cut themselves off they expand themselves and meet other people. When you find that you will feel fulfilment."
2015-11-04,Alarm has been growing in the NHS that junior doctors could go on strike just as hospitals hit their busiest period of the year.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151104144143/http://news.sky.com/story/1581265/hunt-tries-to-bring-medics-back-from-the-brink,"Alarm has been growing in the NHS that junior doctors could go on strike just as hospitals hit their busiest period of the year. So it is no surprise that the Health Secretary has offered a big rise in basic pay in a last ditch bid to avert industrial action. Full details of a ""firm contract offer"" are expected on Wednesday, just a day before the British Medical Association (BMA) begins to ballot 50,000 junior doctors. That is no coincidence. Jeremy Hunt has repeatedly said that average pay will not be cut and has offered ""cast-iron"" guarantees on maximum working hours. But junior doctors have so far shown no sign that they are in the mood for compromise. Several thousand marched through Westminster furious over threats by the Government to impose the contract from next August. The contract extends ""normal"" working hours to include the evenings and Saturdays. That would mean doctors working lots of unsocial hours - for example those in A&E - seeing a reduction in their overtime payments. Doctors are also concerned that hospitals would no longer face the same financial penalties if they breach the number of hours that doctors are contracted for. And they just do not trust the Government's assurances that other aspects of pay would rise to compensate and that there would be a legal cap on working hours written into the new contract. But Mr Hunt has to find a way of bringing the BMA back to the negotiating table. The extension of seven-day services in the NHS can only happen if more junior doctors work weekends - many already do, but not enough, says Mr Hunt. So expect a lot more detail on the proposed contract on Wednesday. It is the Health Secretary's last realistic chance of persuading doctors to step back from the brink of industrial action - action that would inevitably disrupt and possibly harm patient care."

A Saudi Arabian citizen married to a British woman and with four British children, he was captured by bounty hunters in Afghanistan in 2001 and handed on to American forces, where he was held at Bagram Airfield's notorious detention centre, before being flown to a bizarre legal limbo in the netherworld of Guantanamo Bay prison. There, alongside the 800 or so people who have passed through the facility which sits on a tiny piece of Cuba but is under American control, he was neither a prisoner of war not granted the everyday rights held by ordinary Americans. Shaker Aamer's family waited for his release for 14 years But he was, his supporters say, a witness to what went on - for almost a decade-and-a-half. And that is what makes him a ticking bomb in political and legal circles. He alleges that he was tortured into confession. He alleges that this was by the Central Intelligence Agency and witnessed by Britain’s Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. Gallery: The Campaign To Free Shaker Aamer A giant inflatable figure of Shaker Aamer, the last Briton to be detained in Guantanamo Bay, is pictured during a protest by the We Stand With Shaker campaign group outside the U.S embassy on February 13, 2015 in London Deemed ""non-cooperative"", he was put in solitary confinement and allegedly subjected to 300 beatings by the ""forcible cell extraction"" unit in Guantanamo. American authorities have said that many (the figures vary between 15 and around 80) former Guantanamo prisoners who have already been released have returned to the ranks of militant organisations. Some have certainly emerged as leaders of the Taliban and been killed in drone strikes so not all detainees can be said to have been innocent - not at least after their release. But Mr Aamer was cleared for release in 2007, and again three years later, by American authorities across six different departments - his lawyers and supporters believe he was kept locked up because intelligence agencies in the US and probably the UK wanted him to be released to Saudi Arabia. The implication here is that the Saudi authorities, unbound by democratic restraints, would be able to keep him out of circulation, and keep him quiet, indefinitely. Given that the British Government joined calls for his release, it would appear that he will be free once home. Whether he decides to speak out about what happened to him - and to those he was incarcerated with - remains to be seen but given his articulate campaigning from prison the odds are he will be noisy. And so the role of MI6 and the CIA in ""extraordinary renditions"" - the kidnapping of suspects and their secret transfer to detention camps around the world and Guantanamo, allegation of abuse, and of incompetence on the part of foreign spooks in their over-enthusiastic rush to prosecute the War on Terror, will surface once again. On top of that, Mr Aamer's release will again cause many to pause to reflect whether the US, and her allies, have abandoned the very principles of democracy they wish to defend. Combined with the continued use of drone strikes - which involve the extrajudicial execution of alleged terrorists outside of war zones - this case gets even stronger in the minds of America's critics. Gallery: Current And Former Inmates' Allegations Some security officials point to the success of their operations, which would include drones and detentions, as having prevented numerous terrorist attacks against the West. They are, no doubt, correct. But these tactics do besmirch the reputations of those nations involved in them - of that there simply is no doubt. Images of orange jumpsuited detainees bent double, held in stress positions and blindfolded, have served to undermine America's reputation in the regions where it needs most repair against the charges of hypocrisy - notably in the Islamic world."

The Labour leader has lambasted David Cameron for inviting Abdel Fatah al Sisi to Britain, saying that it shows ""contempt for human and democratic rights."" He added that talks with a leader who overthrew a democratically elected president threatened Britain's ""national security"". Mr Corbyn: 'UK should suspend arms exports to Egypt' In a statement Mr Corbyn, who was himself accused of being a threat to national security by the Prime Minister in his conference speech, said Mr Cameron should not be rolling out the red carpet. He said: ""David Cameron's invitation to Britain today of the Egyptian president and coup leader Abdel Fatah al Sisi shows contempt for human and democratic rights and threatens, rather than protects, Britain's national security. ""Support for dialogue and negotiated conflict resolution in the Middle East is vital to us all. But to welcome and bolster with military support the coup leader who overthrew a democratically elected president in 2013 and has presided over the killing and jailing of many thousands since makes a mockery of government claims to be promoting peace and justice in the region. ""Support for dictatorial regimes in the Middle East has been a key factor fuelling the spread of terrorism. Rather than rolling out the red carpet to President Sisi, the Prime Minister should suspend arms exports to Egypt until democratic and civil rights are restored."" In the Lords on Monday, leading Labour QC Baroness Kennedy of the Shaws said Mr Sisi had been ""responsible for the murder of at least a thousand unarmed protesters"" and urged the Prime Minister to confront him over what she called ""his tyranny"". But Lord Courtown defended the decision to invite him to Britain, saying Egypt was ""key"" to the UK's national interest in countering extremism and combating Islamic State (IS) ""It is in Britain's interest to work with President Sisi. Together we need to combat terrorism, we need to counter extremism and help bring stability to Libya,"" he said. Downing Street has previously insisted that ""no issues are off the table"" when the former head of Egypt's armed forces, who led the coup overthrowing Islamist president Mohammed Morsi, takes part in the bilateral discussions. In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, President Sisi has called on Britain to help prevent Libya being ""held hostage"" to extremists following the overthrow of Colonel Gaddafi. He said the NATO-led campaign to remove him in 2011 was ""not completely accomplished"" and the country had been left ""without leadership"". ""Now we have a situation where the will of the Libyan people is being held hostage by militant groups,"" he said."

Jeremy Hunt announced a 11% rise in basic pay as part of a package of concessions to changes being made to junior doctors' contracts. Mr Hunt has written personally to all junior doctors in England with a ""firm"" contract offer that sees three-quarters of medics receiving a pay rise.  But the British Medical Association accused him of using ""megaphone diplomacy"" and pushing ""PR stories""  in an attempt to avert strike action by junior doctors, rather than entering into proper negotiations. :: Analysis: Hunt Tries To Bring Medics Back From The Brink Mr Hunt has introduced the new junior doctors contract in an attempt to tackle the problems of under-staffing in hospitals and surgeries at the weekends as the Government pushes for a seven-day NHS. Under the revised offer, Mr Hunt has also extended the defined ""unsocial hours"" that qualify for higher pay rates to include Saturday evenings after 7pm.  Previously he had said that doctors would only have received the higher rate after 10pm. Currently junior doctors get higher pay for working between 7pm and 7am and all day on Saturday and Sunday. The contract reiterates the ""cast-iron"" guarantee that doctors will work an average 48-hour week, with a maximum set at 72 hours, down from 91. There will also be ""golden hello"" premiums paid to those working in general practice, A&E and psychiatry, which currently have high vacancy rates. Junior doctors fear they will see an overall reduction in salary of around 30% but speaking to Sky News Mr Hunt said that 99% would suffer no cut in pay at all. However, he admitted 500 doctors would see a reduction but only because they were working ""unsafe"" numbers of hours. Mr Hunt said: ""At the moment we have very high weekend rates and we have two-thirds of our hospitals in deficit at the moment and what those weekend rates do, is they force hospitals to rosta around three times less medical cover. ""What you have noticed at the weekends and that's where we have an independent study published in September that said the mortality rate for people admitted at weekends was higher - one of the reasons they say that needs to be look at is the medical cover at weekends."" The British Medical Association (BMA) will begin balloting its junior doctor members for industrial action this Thursday. It would be only the second time in the past 43 years. It has refused to re-enter negotiations over the new contract and has warned doctors that the contact will result in pay cuts and dangerously long working hours. Many junior doctors are furious over the plans, with several thousand marching through Westminster last month. Gallery: Junior Doctors March Over Contracts Thousands of junior doctors have protested in central London over proposed new contracts Johann Malawana, chairman of the BMA's junior doctors committee, told Sky News: ""We want to see proposals that have meaningful safeguards that prevent doctors actually working excessive hours ... ""In the proposals we have seen so far, the very safeguards that have driven down hours and keep hours lower within the NHS are actually the safeguards that Jeremy Hunt is now saying he wants to stop and what he is offering instead are not meaningful safeguards on those doctors' hours.

The first planes carrying 1,417 holidaymakers have begun to land in Britain - two days after the UK suspended flights amid security concerns. But the vast majority of tourists who thought they would be coming home were left frustrated at the terminal after Egypt said it would allow just eight of the 29 rescue flights organised by the UK to proceed. That meant several UK jets en route to Egypt could be seen diverting on flight tracker websites. It is believed some headed to land in Cyprus. One of two easyJet flights permitted to leave lands at Gatwick Egypt blamed Britain's ban on hold luggage - claiming the airport could not cope with any more bags. It comes amid growing evidence that the Russian jet with 224 on board was downed by a terrorist bomb. The US has announced new measures to tighten security on flights heading from ""fewer than 10"" airports in the region and Russia has followed the UK in suspending flights to and from Egypt - leaving 45,000 Russians stranded. Downing Street said the task of bringing British holidaymakers home posed ""a number of logistical complexities"". Following an emergency Cobra meeting, a Number 10 spokesman said: ""This is a hugely complex operation. We continue to work closely with both the Egyptian authorities and the airline carriers to get people safely home as quickly as possible. But the sheer scale of the task poses a number of logistical complexities. ""Our aim remains to bring holidaymakers back to the UK as soon as possible. We are working with airlines to ensure passengers get the message not to make the journey to Sharm airport until airlines have absolute confirmation that they will be able to travel. ""Our first priority remains the safety and well-being of British travellers."" :: Thomas Cook said just one of its four anticipated flights was allowed to land in Sharm el Sheikh. This is dropping passengers at Birmingham and then East Midlands Airport. :: Monarch said four of its five flights from the UK landed at Sharm El Sheikh airport. The fifth flight was diverted to Larnaca. The company said just two of its planes were allowed to depart for Birmingham and Gatwick on Friday but two more would fly to Manchester on Saturday. :: EasyJet said eight of its planned departures had been postponed - but 359 passengers are being flown to Luton and Gatwick on two flights. Another two planes will leave for Luton on Saturday. :: Thomson said just two of its flights were allowed to depart for Gatwick ""due to a last-minute change in Egyptian government restrictions"". :: British Airways said its flight from Sharm to Gatwick left as planned. There have been tense scenes at the airport, with a confrontation between angry passengers and Britain's ambassador to Egypt, John Casson, caught on camera. The UK's decision to suspend flights came as lax security was exposed at Sharm airport after a British holidaymaker revealed he jumped queues and baggage checks by paying just £20."

Billy Johnson, 20, is wanted on suspicion of murder after Kerry Reeves died in hospital on Thursday. The 26-year-old was shot in the head in Thornhill Walk, Abingdon on Tuesday. Officers are warning the public not to approach Mr Johnson, who they say may be armed. Another man, aged 20 and from Ealing, has been arrested on suspicion of murder. Detectives have yet to locate the gun used in the shooting. Miss Reeves' mother, Nicola, issued a statement saying she was devastated. ""On Tuesday evening my beautiful, funny daughter was brutally taken from me, aged just 26,"" she said. ""Holding her in my arms for the last time is something a mother should never have to go through. ""Trying to take in how she looked, kissing her, never wanting to let her go. ""Myself and Kerry's family are completely devastated not only by the loss of our beautiful young girl but the horrific way Kerry was taken from us."" Mr Johnson is white, 5ft 8ins, with very short brown hair and blue eyes. He has ""mum"" tattooed on his right arm and a tattoo on his right hand bearing the words ""life is precious"". He is believed to have links to London, Corby in Northamptonshire, and Oxfordshire. Detective Chief Inspector Mike Lynch, of Thames Valley Police, said: ""Our investigation appears to indicate that this was not a random attack and the offenders knew Kerry. ""We are still actively searching for a further suspect."""

Sergeant Rick Clement was seriously injured after stepping on a mine while serving with the Duke of Lancashire regiment in Helmand in 2010. The 35-year-old 'died' twice on the flight home from Camp Bastion and spent months in hospital battling to recover from his injuries while learning to walk on prosthetic legs. On Remembrance Sunday he will honour the memory of close friends and others in the military who paid with their lives while serving their country. He will attempt to walk on his prosthetic limbs unaided for the first time, covering about 10 metres. Speaking of the moment he stepped on a Taliban improvised explosive device, he told Sky News: ""The blast took both of my legs (and caused) a lot of internal injuries and damage to the genital area which left me unable to have children. ""It was catastrophic and I'm lucky to be here. ""There were struggling times in hospital in the first few months when I thought that was the end of life as I knew it and I would need to be looked after the rest of my life. ""But thankfully with the support of my family and friends and all the military guys, who are another family, I managed to get through it okay."" As well as honouring the contribution of Britain's service personnel, Sergeant Clement will also pay respects to close friends Jordan, Nigel, Taggi and Rocco, who were killed in service in Afghanistan. ""I use them as inspiration for me to get out of bed and carry on,"" he said. ""To take those few steps in their honour and all the others that paid the ultimate sacrifice, it will mean the world to me. ""They'll probably be up there hoping I'll trip over so they can have a good laugh, to be fair. I hope they'll be very proud, definitely."""

An easyJet flight carrying British tourists left stranded in Sharm was the first to arrive at Gatwick shortly after 4pm, followed by another at Luton around an hour later. The airline has delayed another seven UK-bound flights until Saturday. A total of 29 flights were initially expected to leave Sharm, but this was reduced to just eight amid confusion at the airport. It is feared some might not make it back this weekend. John Casson, the British ambassador to Egypt, told Sky News the eight flights that left are carrying approximately 1,500 Britons. When asked how long it will take to repatriate everyone, he said: ""I won't put a number of days on it just yet."" One of the passengers who touched down at Luton described the situation at Sharm as an ""absolute shambles"". ""We've never experienced such madness at an airport if I'm totally honest,"" another said. Nick Hazelwood, from Kent, criticised the airlines and Sharm airport, labelling them ""absolutely useless"". ""They made it a bit worse than it needed to be,"" he said after landing at Gatwick. ""The security in Egypt was shocking. We said that when we landed. ""People could pay cheap money to be fast-tracked through without being searched. ""It was still going on today. I think it's a joke. We need a bit of a presence out there. ""I don't think we should be flying out there at all. Security needs to be tightened."" His mother, Maxine Hazelwood, said: ""I'm so relieved it's over. ""It's just been an absolute nightmare. They were hysterical and frightened and there was a total lack of information."" Sarah Cotterill, who was one of those on the first easyJet flight to land, told Sky News there was ""a lot of resentment towards British people"" from airport staff as they tried to get home. She said: ""They were all very rude and rash with us. It wasn't a very nice atmosphere there. ""Maybe they think we have overreacted or something. It wasn't a nice place to be, Sharm el Sheikh airport this afternoon."" Ms Cotterill added that when she went to the airport on Wednesday to board her scheduled flight back home, security ""didn't seem very good at all"". She said: ""Today it seemed a little bit better, but I mean when we went through security on Wednesday, as you go into the airport you get scanned and the guys were chatting and smoking and not watching the screens as the bags were going through."" Earlier there were tense scenes at the airport, with a confrontation between angry passengers and Mr Casson, caught on camera. Downing Street said the task of bringing British holidaymakers home posed ""a number of logistical complexities"". Customers coming back are not allowed to bring any hold luggage with them, and Egypt's civil aviation minister said the volume of luggage left behind has disrupted operations. Thomas Cook and Monarch were forced to turn some of their planes around mid-flight after being told they would not be allowed to land in Sharm."
2015-11-08,On 15 April 1945 British troops liberated the Bergen-Belsen Nazi concentration camp near Hanover in Germany.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151108140632/http://news.sky.com/story/1583443/piles-of-corpses-veteran-on-horror-of-war,"By Alistair Bunkall, Defence Correspondent On 15 April 1945 British troops liberated the Bergen-Belsen Nazi concentration camp near Hanover in Germany. They found a horrific scene: thousands of dead prisoners and thousands more seriously ill and close to death. Colonel Leonard Berney was one of the first British soldiers inside the camp and he shares his memories on Remembrance Sunday. ""We had no idea what we were going to see,"" he said. ""All we knew was that there were about 60,000 prisoners in this camp and the disease typhus had broken out and that's all we knew. ""When we went into the camp, what we were met with was absolute shock and horror. We had no conception of what we were going to see at all."" The British soldiers had negotiated a truce with the German guards, so the camp was handed over without a fight. Colonel Berney: 'We'd never seen anything like it' Now 95, Col Berney says the images still haunt him. ""There were piles of corpses on both sides of the roads. And in between the huts there were piles of corpses. There was an enormous stench of death. It was really, really awful. ""At the very end of the camp there was a big mass grave, about the length of a tennis court I suppose, with hundreds of corpses already in it. ""We'd been fighting battle after battle from Normandy for 10 months up to that time when we got to the camp, and we were used to seeing casualties and people killed, but never, never had we seen anything like this at all."" It is thought as many as 70,000 people died in the camp, many from typhus, after it was liberated. The British Army restored electricity and set up emergency medical centres to treat the sick, but for thousands it was too late. ""The people that were there were mostly emaciated, walking skeletons, in a complete daze,"" said Col Berney. ""They didn't really realise they were being rescued. There were a few in a better condition, some wearing prison clothes, some wearing rags. ""I remember it was a real Dante's Inferno, I will never forget it."" It took a number of weeks to remove all the bodies and bury them properly. Germans living nearby were brought in to be shown what had been going on inside the camp and to ensure such evil was never forgotten. Belsen's commandant Josef Kramer was found guilty of war crimes and hanged later that year. The camp itself was burned to the ground. For Remembrance Sunday the Queen, joined by the Duke of Edinburgh and members of the leading political parties, attended a special service - gathering at the Cenotaph in central London. A two-minute silence was held at 11am, with wreaths will be laid at the foot of the Whitehall memorial. This was followed by a veterans' march - and this year's ceremony was slightly shorter to reduce the time elderly war veterans had to stand."

2015-11-08,Sixty-five years. That’s how far back you have to go to find another period when interest rates were as fixed for as long as they have been recently.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151108140632/http://news.sky.com/story/1582287/carney-charts-course-the-fed-could-scupper,"Sixty-five years. That’s how far back you have to go to find another period when interest rates were as fixed for as long as they have been recently. And today the Bank of England has signalled that we are likely to have at least one more year of record-low interest rates in the UK. To understand why, you need to dig through the bank’s Inflation Report. Now, strictly speaking, the IR is the central bank’s quarterly opportunity to update its growth forecast. But in practice all most people want to know from it is when interest rates are likely to move, and by how much. And buried in the tables and charts within it are a few big hints. The main question is whether inflation is likely to be above or below its 2% target in two years’ time (for various reasons, some sensible, some traditional, the bank’s main ""forecast horizon"" tends to be two years). So the bank runs its models, based on what investors in the market are expecting to happen to interest rates. Broadly speaking, if the resulting inflation forecast says CPI will be above target in two years, it implies that investors are not expecting enough rate increases in the coming months and years. After all, higher interest rates tend to bring down inflation. Likewise, if the inflation forecast comes out below target, markets are expecting too aggressive a series of rate hikes. This is why so much attention is paid to these bizarre fan charts contained in the Inflation Report – they represent a major signal of where rates are likely to head. On that front, today’s IR was a little more complicated than normal. The main message was that if interest rates went up at the rate markets expected then inflation would be ever so slightly above target in two years’ time: 2.06%, to be precise. Now, normally one might construe this as a slightly hawkish sign (eg that markets’ expectations for rates increases were too cautious). However (and it’s a big however) when those forecasts were being put together, there were some pretty wild market forecasts for rates – that they would not go up until late spring of 2017. That wild yield curve (the technical term for market rate expectations) has since moderated to a slightly more conservative one, suggesting rates would start to go up in the final quarter of next year. In other words, the bank was hinting that even if interest rates went up in the first half of 2017, inflation would still be pretty close to target. The implication is that if the magic take-off moment actually came somewhere between Q4 2016 and Q2 2017, that would probably be about right. Now, this is, of course, an inexact science. A year ago, markets were forecasting (with the bank’s blessing) that interest rates would be about 1% today. Five years ago, they were forecasting that rates today would be 3.75%. Not all that long ago, the bank’s governor, Mark Carney, said the decision to raise interest rates would ""come into sharper relief"" at the turn of this year. In other words, things change in monetary policy – and quickly. Perhaps if and when the Federal Reserve decides to raise US interest rates (which could happen as soon as next month), Mr Carney will change his tune. However, for the time being, the mood music in Threadneedle Street is that we will have yet another year’s worth of record low interest rates before borrowing starts getting more expensive, and savings start yielding a bigger return."

The guitar was used by the star for a year Its whereabouts were unknown for half a decade until a man in California discovered that the guitar in his possession may have historical value. Julien's Auctions sold it to an undisclosed buyer for one of highest prices for rock and roll memorabilia. Mr Julien said: ""It's such an important part of Lennon's career and Beatles history. I knew it would go over $1m; I had no idea it would go over $2m."" The price far surpasses the $965,000 paid at a 2013 Christie's auction for an electric guitar owned by Bob Dylan.

Under a leaden sky in London, the Queen led the nation in a two-minute silence, remembering the country's war dead. This year's ceremony was slightly shorter to reduce the time elderly war veterans had to stand. Thousands of people lined Whitehall beside the Cenotaph Her Majesty, joined by the Duke of Edinburgh and other members of the Royal family, laid a wreath at the Cenotaph as part of the annual commemoration. King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands also placed a wreath at the foot of the Whitehall memorial, following an invitation from the Queen to mark the 70th anniversary of the liberation of the Netherlands after the end of the Second World War. For the first time Prince Harry laid his own wreath. He left operational service this year after a decade serving in the army including two tours of Afghanistan. A proposal for the country's opposition politicians to lay wreaths together as part of trimming the duration of the event was scrapped after a Westminster backlash forced a rethink by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, which oversees ceremonial arrangements.

The Thomson flight from Stansted is said to have come within 1,000ft of the object back on 23 August, before later landing safely. The Department for Transport (DfT) told Sky News it investigated the incident and concluded it was not a targeted attack. It said it was ""likely to be connected to routine exercises being conducted by the Egyptian military in the area at the time"". The Daily Mail quoted a source as saying: ""The first officer was in charge at the time but the pilot was in the cockpit and saw the rocket coming towards the plane. ""He ordered that the flight turn to the left to avoid the rocket, which was about 1,000ft away."" Egyptian officials hit out at the report on Saturday, calling it ""preposterous"". The Twitter account of Egypt's foreign ministry spokesman said: ""(The) incident involved ground-to-ground fire exercise in military bases few km off Sharm airport, no ground-to-air firing involved whatsoever. ""Egypt &UK govs fully aware that plane was in no danger. Airliners previously informed of military exercise & instructed of procedures."" A Thomson spokesman confirmed ""an event"" had been reported by the crew of flight TOM 476 on 23 August. ""Upon landing into Sharm el-Sheikh, an initial assessment was conducted and the event was immediately reported to the UK Department for Transport (DfT) in line with established protocol. ""The DfT conducted a full investigation in conjunction with other UK government experts. ""After reviewing the details of the case, the investigation concluded that there was no cause for concern and it was safe to continue our flying programme to Sharm el Sheikh."" A spokesman for Tui Group, that owns Thomson, said the DfT's view at the time was that ""it was probably a flare"". The claim comes in the wake of the downing of a Russian jet in the Sinai peninsula, with evidence suggesting a bomb was planted on board. Thousands of British holidaymakers remain stranded in Sharm, trying to board the small number of flights the Egyptian authorities are allowing to take off. Islamic State affiliated terrorists active in the region have claimed responsibility for the disaster involving the Metrojet plane, which was carrying 224 people from Sharm to St Petersburg. In the wake of the disaster it was noted by many experts that the militants were unlikely to possess the weapons necessary to shoot a plane out of the sky from more than 30,000ft. Instead, intelligence has emerged suggesting a bomb was smuggled into the hold of the plane."

The heptathlete, who also won the award in 2012, made a triumphant return to the World Championships in Beijing this summer when she regained the title she won in 2009 in Berlin. Ennis-Hill, 29, came out on top in China only 13 months after giving birth to her son Reggie in July 2014. Second place in the vote went to UCI World Road Race champion Lizzie Armitstead, who bounced back from injury to beat the cream of women's cycling in the US city of Richmond in September. Skeleton star Lizzy Yarnold finished third after a year that saw her crowned World and European champion. Previous winners of the coveted title include Sally Gunnell, Dame Kelly Holmes and Victoria Pendleton. Receiving her award from the 2013 winner Christine Ohuruogu, Ennis-Hill said: ""I said I wasn't going to get emotional but it is emotional standing here because it's been an incredibly hard year, adjusting to life as a mum and having all those amazing experiences, and then reaching the top of my career again, it's been absolutely incredible. ""I am just so honoured to receive this award, because this time last year I never thought I would be in this room with these amazing women who have not only achieved so much, but they are changing their sports and doing such incredible things."" She added: ""It wasn't until I competed at the Anniversary Games in London that I even decided to go to the World Championships as it had been an up and down year, and I struggled with a couple of injuries with my Achilles, so it was one of those last-minute decisions. ""I thought I might contend for a medal, but I thought it would be a bronze. There was always that worry that I might come away with nothing so to come away with gold I really didn't expect it. ""I'm very much looking forward to next year. If I can get there in one piece it'll be my last Olympics so I really want to enjoy it, I want it to be special and I want my family to be part of it."" EuroHockey champions England won Team of the Year, sprinter Dina Asher-Smith Young Sportswoman, and Jordanne Whiley the Disability Sportswoman of the Year. Midlands football coach Annie Zaidi received the Helen Rollason Award for Inspiration and 74-year-old Enid Bakewell, who top-scored for England during the inaugural women's cricket World Cup finals in 1973, won the Lifetime Achievement Award."

The France 2 TV channel quotes an investigator with access to the black box - but the country's BEA accident and investigation body said it could not confirm his claims. If correct, the report supports UK intelligence that a bomb was smuggled into the hold of the Metrojet plane that crashed in Egypt last weekend, killing all 224 people on board. It is claimed that US officials reported chatter between Islamic State leaders in Sinai and Syria about the Egypt plane, and discussions included boasts about taking down an airliner and how it was done. ""They were clearly celebrating,"" the US broadcaster NBC reported, citing US officials. UK spies found evidence of a major plot in intercepts picked up during a review of the disaster, Sky News understands. Sky's Foreign Affairs Editor Sam Kiley said: ""Following the downing of the aircraft, British intelligence went back over existing material and began to see some kind of signal that indicated a bomb had been placed on this aircraft."" The discovery has created a diplomatic row between the UK and Russia, who, having previously played down Islamic State claims of responsibility, want to see the intelligence. Kiley said: ""The interesting thing is that the intelligence was missed in the first place, which will anger the Russians in particular. ""The Russians and Egyptians want the British to share this intelligence with them. ""The British are resisting that very strongly - quite often they've said they'll share the conclusions but not the raw material because access to the raw material will reveal their capabilities."" Western intelligence sources who spoke to Reuters said the evidence was not categorical and there was no hard forensic or scientific evidence to support the bomb theory. As the investigation into the cause of the disaster continues, flights from Sharm to the UK have resumed in the face of heightened security. The US has tightened security on planes heading from Egypt, while Russia has followed the UK in suspending flights - but Vladimir Putin insists this is not because he is convinced of the bomb theory.  It has also been announced Britain will set up a small military operations team in Egypt to monitor extremism in the region."

Jetman Dubai - Yves Rossy and Vince Reffet - joined the Emirates A380 over the Palm Juneirah and Dubai skyline for a showcase of how far the world of aviation has come. The routine may appear effortless but it involved meticulous planning to keep everyone safe. The stunt saw the A380 - the world's largest passenger jet - flying at 4,000ft in two holding patterns. Jetman Dubai, pilots of the smallest jet-propelled wings, were then deployed from a helicopter flying 1,500ft above the Emirates jet. They then conducted formations on both sides of the aircraft against the backdrop of a Dubai sunset before breaking away from the plane. :: See the full video version"
2015-11-08,"There are four of us: my wife, myself, our daughter and our son. To different degrees we are all affected by what happened to our son.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151108140632/http://news.sky.com/story/1581959/how-my-son-became-an-online-grooming-victim,"There are four of us: my wife, myself, our daughter and our son. To different degrees we are all affected by what happened to our son. When he was 13, my son first became a victim of grooming and sexual assault. There were a number of perpetrators - all male, no gangs, ages ranged from early twenties to around 50. They acted independently and the majority of incidents occurred over a period of about six months. Largely, the grooming was via the internet and mobile phones and that's how meetings were arranged. There was a sudden, drastic and negative change in our son's behaviour at home and at school. Our son was seen by a police officer (ChildLine/victim of cyberbullying); our GP (for panic attacks) and, because of the change in his behaviour and educational progress, his school also became involved. None of those people suspected the cause might be grooming/sexual abuse, nor did my wife … nor did I. We now realise the signs of grooming and sexual abuse were there but at the time our awareness of these crimes was so far removed from our experience none of us considered it as the cause of change in his behaviour. The first discovery was a few months into the abuse. We were horrified by what had been done to him and not sure what we could do to keep him safe. The grooming happened via the internet and mobile phones We had no knowledge at that time of grooming child sexual abuse. However, it soon became clear that by the time we discovered the grooming a great deal of damage had been done - he had already been the victim of sexual abuse. His groomers drove an emotional wedge between him and us and they coerced him to believe it was acceptable to behave in ways that previously he'd have found abhorrent. Grooming transformed our son from an innocent child to one whose mind could be - and was - manipulated by men to believe they were his friends and their expressions of love were genuine. There were attempts to lure my son away from his family. These were quite determined and showed no concern for the damage that would be caused. These men were very good at what they set out to do. In a few short months he had changed from being a popular boy to one who had few male friends; from being an 'entertainer' to being withdrawn; from being relatively timid in unfamiliar situations to seeking contact with strangers via the web; from a close and loving son to a person who saw us and others who were trying to help him as the enemy. Over three years all his attackers went through the criminal justice system. My son gave evidence. We are in our fifth year of managing the effects of grooming and sexual abuse crimes perpetrated against our son. That's a long time but the final man has recently been sentenced. However, the effects on my son and our family will not end. Things improve with time, of course, but the damage goes deep and it is truly life changing. We look back from time to time and think of what we might have done differently. Could we have somehow prevented what happened? Difficult, because we feel we should somehow have protected him. We gave those warnings about safety all families should deliver - but in our case it didn't work and even today we're not sure why. Total barring of internet access might have done it, but in the world today I wonder if that's a practical possibility. My son is now more mature and understands the reality of what happened to him but although that recognition is part of his recovery it also means he now lives with dreadful memories of how he was manipulated and treated so badly. We worry about him constantly. We are an affected family. Our son is an abused child. Our experiences of dealing with the physical, emotional effects of these crimes against our son were horrific. He is so much better than he was but he - and we - lost a chunk of his childhood, never to be reclaimed. There has been overwhelming emotional stress on all the family which is difficult to describe. Words like despair, fear, anger, frustration and failure would be a good fit. :: The father of the boy cannot be named to protect his son's identity."

Mr Fisher had faced calls for his expulsion after suggesting people should vote for a Class War candidate against Labour's Emily Benn in the Croydon South seat in May. There have also been protests about his social media attacks on senior party figures - including Tony Blair and Jack Straw. The Labour leader said he continues to have ""full confidence"" in Mr Fisher, who will remain employed by his office. The party's ruling National Executive Committee (NEC) has been asked to investigate and recommend disciplinary action if appropriate. Mr Fisher also said Tony Blair should be charged with war crimes :: Analysis: Corbyn At War With Labour Establishment Ms Benn - the granddaughter of Tony Benn - made a formal complaint against Mr Fisher after he sent a tweet in August last year calling for people to back one of her rivals. He wrote: ""FFS if you live in Croydon South, vote with dignity, vote @campaignbeard"" - referring to Class War parliamentary candidate Jon Bigger. When asked by a friend on Facebook if he had ever met Mr Fisher, Mr Bigger replied: ""He used to work in PCS HQ but I last met him on election day where he was campaigning for Labour in Croydon Central. ""He wished me luck. But he's absolutely a Labour guy through and through. ""I also thanked him for the tweet and support last year - there was no hint of it being a joke at the time."" According to Labour rules, any member who supports a politician standing against a Labour candidate ""shall automatically be ineligible to be or remain a party member"". Mr Fisher deleted his Twitter account last week. He also wrote to Labour's general secretary Iain McNicol to say he ""completely and unreservedly"" apologises for his social media message, which he claimed had been ""misinterpreted"". ""I obviously do not and did not support Class War in any way, let alone in an election. I was and am committed to the election of a Labour government and a successful and united Labour Party,"" he said. ""I accept that the tweet has been misinterpreted and has caused embarrassment and understandable upset among party members, which I regret."" It is not the first time Mr Fisher has been criticised for his social media comments. He described Ed Miliband's frontbench as ""the most abject collection of complete s***e"" and said Tony Blair should be charged with war crimes for his role in the Iraq war. He also celebrated Ed Balls' election defeat, saying it was ""fitting that the architect of Labour's miserable austerity-lite economic policies should lose"". Mr Corbyn said: ""I have full confidence in Andrew Fisher and his work. I respect the integrity of the General Secretary's office and trust that this matter will be settled as quickly as possible."""

The British astronaut - who will lift off from Kazakhstan next month - revealed the secrets of the perfect space brew to a group of school children at the Science Museum as part of Hot Seat, a collaboration between Sky News and First News, the UK's national newspaper for young people.  Tim Peake was questioned by a six-strong panel of youngsters Mr Peake told of his concerns about the tea situation on board the space station - because of zero gravity, current techniques require keeping the teabag in the pouch. ""The trouble is that if you're spending ten fifteen minutes drinking your cup of tea, it's going to get stewed, it's going to get stronger and stronger, and it's really not going to taste nice at all. ""So I've come up with a small device that will enable me to transfer my tea once it's brewed into another foil pouch that has nothing in it. ""That way I can spend as long as I like drinking my tea and it won't get stewed and hopefully it won't get cold either."" Mr Peake faced questions from a six-strong panel, drawn from First News readers and schools around the country.  Ayanna Davis, 12, asked what the biggest challenge of astronaut training. Mr Peake said it was learning Russian - necessary because every ISS astronaut hitches their ride in a Soyuz capsule, with a Russian commander. He said: ""I love all the practical training, I'm very technically minded coming from a pilot background. ""The systems training, none of that's bothered me, I love the space walk training, but put me in a classroom and try to teach me Russian language - that's been a struggle."" Asked by 16-year-old Elizabeth O'Shea, about the discovery of water on Mars, Mr Peake said: ""It's all leading to a really exciting future, where I'm convinced that we'll be able to colonise Mars. ""And that's the steps we're taking. The evidence for water on Mars is very exciting - not just for growing foods, but also a fuel source as well it's very important."" Aitan Zetial, aged nine, wondered who had been his inspiration. Choosing Bruce McAndless, a NASA astronaut, Mr Peake said: ""He was the first astronaut to ever do an untethered EVA (Extravehicular activity) out of the back of a space shuttle. ""Just because what he did was really groundbreaking, it was very high risk activity and the level of isolation he must have felt hundreds of metres from the space shuttle, just him and a jetpack, no cables, no tethers at all. That takes a lot of guts to do that."" Mr Peake also said he had been thinking about drinking recycled urine for the next five or so months. ""We recycle water here on planet earth, we do the same on the space station, it's just on the space station it's a much shorter cycle. ""The water apparently tastes great - 90% of the water is recycled from urine, so it's a large volume,"" he said. There will be at least some home comforts in the form of a Christmas pudding on 25 December, when he will be in orbit. But it's unlikely to feature brandy or fire, though."

The Government plans to give the public a legal right to an ""affordable"" connection - making it a basic service like water or electricity. The creation of a universal service obligation will provide a regulatory ""safety net"" for households and businesses as access is extended to the most remote and hardest to reach areas by the end of the current parliament in 2020. Mr Cameron said: ""Access to the internet shouldn't be a luxury; it should be a right - absolutely fundamental to life in 21st century Britain. That is why I'm announcing a giant leap in my digital mission for Britain. ""Just as our forebears effectively brought gas, electricity and water to all, we're going to bring fast broadband to every home and business that wants it. ""We're getting Britain - all of Britain - online, and on the way to becoming the most prosperous economy in the whole of Europe."" Officials say the aim is to ensure consumers have access to a connection with a speed of at least 10 Megabits per second, no matter where in the country they live. More than 83% of homes and businesses in Britain currently have access to a superfast broadband connection, with that number set to rise to 95% by 2017. The Prime Minister is expected to set out further details of the plan next week."
2015-11-08,American private equity investors are poised to take a 25% stake in AFC Bournemouth.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151108140632/http://news.sky.com/story/1583536/us-investors-poised-for-25-percent-bournemouth-stake,"By Paul Kelso, Sports Correspondent American private equity investors are poised to take a 25% stake in AFC Bournemouth. Sky News understands that Chicago-based Peak 6 have completed negotiations for a quarter-share of the club, with the deal expected to be announced on Monday. It will see them take an influential role alongside current owner, Russian petrochemicals trader Maxim Demin, whose substantial investment in recent seasons helped Bournemouth’s unexpected rise to the Premier League. Demin, who has shunned publicity since he bought into the club in 2011, is expected to remain involved. The fresh investment comes after Bournemouth suffered their fourth consecutive Premier League defeat to Newcastle on Saturday, and with just one win in their last seven games. Eddie Howe’s side are third-bottom of the Premier League having won just two games all season as they struggle to acclimatise to the demands of the competition. Fresh investment may give Howe more funds to strengthen his squad in the January transfer window, but Peak 6 are likely to take a long-term view of investment in a club that faces a struggle to avoid relegation. Eddie Howe's side are currently struggling in the Premier League Peak 6 was founded in 1997 by Matt Hulsizer and Jenny Just, both former commodity traders, who describe themselves as ""entrepreneurs at heart"". On its website Peak 6 says: ""We operate with a focused, entrepreneurial drive and push ourselves to think differently. This ambitious, visionary approach has helped us become the diverse range of successful businesses we are today."" The American investment is another chapter in Bournemouth’s remarkable rise from near-bankruptcy in 1997 to English football’s top division. The position was so perilous 18 years ago that it took a bucket collection at the town's Winter Gardens to help keep the club afloat. It was re-formed as a community club and began the long process of rebuilding. Investment by local businessmen stabilised Bournemouth before the arrival of Demin, who was introduced to the club after contracting then chairman Eddie Mitchell, a builder, to work on the construction of his house. Demin’s involvement was followed by an unlikely but hugely popular promotion to the Premier League under Howe’s leadership. They may struggle to stay up, but there can be no greater symbol of the Premier League’s global reach than the alliance of Chicago private equity investors and a Russian energy trader on the south coast. Neither Bournemouth or Peak 6 responded to requests for comment at time of publication."

The actor-director was introduced to the members of staff at Social Bite cafe, which donates all of its profits to charity. One in four members of staff in the five Social Bite shops across Scotland were homeless before working there. The chain runs a ""suspended"" coffee and food programme where customers can buy a hot drink or food for a homeless person. Clooney told Sky News he thought the charity was ""fantastic"" and ""loved the idea of paying it forward"". ""I like what they're doing, I think it's a very important cause. I think the idea that we can all participate in everyone's difficulties is really important,"" he said. Clooney took a selfie with the staff The movie star described Edinburgh as ""beautiful"" and said he felt bad for the crowd who had been waiting for him because ""they're standing out in the cold"". The award-winner was invited to the cafe by its founder Josh Littlejohn, who said: ""George is an incredible guy, someone who has achieved real global fame but thinks nothing of visiting a local sandwich shop to chat to the workers and discuss the issue of homelessness. ""He was delighted to spend time with some of our formerly homeless staff and hear the stories of how they have transformed their lives through full-time work. Clooney shook the hands of dozens of fans ""The fact that he not only sampled the food himself but also pre-paid meals for homeless people to claim later made it extra special."" Sky's James Matthews, who was also in the cafe, said he did not see any food pass Clooney's lips. One Social Bite staff member who met Clooney was kitchen worker Sonny Murray, who was homeless two years ago. The 36-year-old said: ""Only two years ago I was living on the streets of Edinburgh with a heroin addiction and unable to even afford to eat. ""Today I'm in full-time employment, have an amazing family and I just made lunch for one of the biggest stars on the planet. Clooney hands some money over the counter ""George genuinely seems like a great guy and it was a really special moment when he came into Social Bite to see what it is all about."" Later Clooney will have lunch with Heather McGowan who has won a competition to meet him. The 32-year-old wedding planner said she was ""absolutely delighted"" to have won, and was ""really interested to find out how involved he was in planning his wedding to Amal"". Clooney will finish off his trip to Scotland by speaking at the Scottish Business Awards, hosted by comedian Rob Brydon. All proceeds from the event will be donated to a range of charities, including the Social Bite Fund and the humanitarian charity co-founded by Clooney."

Women who suffer hot flushes and night sweats should be offered the treatment after a discussion about the benefits and risks, according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Research in 2002 linked HRT with an increase in breast and ovarian cancer - leading to a sharp decline in the number of women using it. But Professor Mary Ann Lumsden, chair of the NICE expert group and an honorary consultant gynaecologist, said there was a need ""to look again"" at HRT. ""What we would like is that people who need it and would benefit from it, have the option of considering it,"" she said. ""At the moment, everyone has lost confidence in it but we would like more confidence in explaining the treatment options so individual women can be part of the decision-making. ""Since the 2002 study, GPs have lost confidence because we are taught to do no harm and you can't do harm if you don't prescribe it."" Around 1.5 million women - some 80% of those going through the menopause - will experience symptoms which will typically continue for around four years after their last period. But for 10% of women symptoms can last for up to 12 years. Chloe was 22 years old when she was diagnosed with premature menopause. It took her 10 months to find the help she needed. She told Sky News: ""My GP gave me a leaflet on handling the menopause and that was it, it was a leaflet aimed at 50-year-old women. ""There was no guidance, I think he advised me to sleep with the windows open. ""I was then even seen in a gynaecological ward in hospital and they had no clue what to do. ""The first HRT I was put on was the wrong HRT for me and it made me feel much worse, until I was put on the HRT I am on now which made me feel much, much better."" Chloe credits The Daisy Network - a website for those affected by premature menopause - with helping her learn about her treatment options. ""Many, many doctors still think there are too many risks with HRT despite lots and lots of reports coming out that the benefits can outweigh the risks."""

The Public and Commercial Services Union, which represents around 1,600 Driving and Vehicle Standards Agency staff, will walk out over new working patterns. The union says these changes to work hours will mean members working longer shifts. The strike action will affect 360 sites across the UK, including examiners who carry out vehicle safety checks. Members of the Prospect union, who test heavy goods vehicles and buses, will also take industrial action, striking for three hours from 8am on 20 November. Helen Stevens, Prospect negotiator, said, ""Prospect has been trying to reach an agreement with DVSA for months and industrial action is our last resort.

DVSA chief executive, Paul Satoor, said: ""Staff signed up to a new standard employment contract in April 2014 in exchange for a lump-sum payment and a three year pay deal.

Grandmother Kalyani Uthaman was injured at the Premier Inn at Newcraighall in August 2012. The 59-year-old, from India, reportedly died of multiple organ failure six weeks later. Glen Millar, of Thompsons Solicitors, said the family viewed it as a means to prevent ""further deaths in similar tragic circumstances"". He has argued a fatal accident inquiry (FAI) should have been held into the death, but the Crown said it was not in the public interest and informed the family of the decision in January last year. Mr Millar added an expression of condolence issued after the summons was the first communication from Whitbread ""at all on the case for over two years"". A Crown Office spokesman said: ""The incident was fully investigated by police, the council and health and safety experts and while this is a tragic case, independent Crown counsel agree that there would be no focus for a discretionary FAI and no recommendations for a sheriff to make."" A summons has been served on Whitbread plc, the hotel chain’s operators. A spokeswoman for Premier Inn said: ""This is a very sad incident. Our thoughts are with the family of Ms Uthaman during what must have been, and which must remain, an extremely difficult period for them. ""We have worked closely with and supported the relevant authorities with their inquiries around this case."" Ms Uthaman's son, Sundar Vadivel Uthaman, 44, from Bangalore, told BBC Scotland: ""It is an irreparable loss given the love and affection she had for us and we had for her. ""It was something none of us expected would ever happen in a very safe country like the UK."""

An apologetic no-show at your local church fete is one thing. Failing to turn up to a heads of government meeting when you need a big favour from them is something else entirely. David Cameron has made his excuses at the first meeting of EU leaders since he outlined his demands for reform ahead of the referendum on Britain's membership. Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, has called an informal meeting to discuss the migration crisis held directly after the Valletta summit in Malta. The British Prime Minister has already flown home. To be fair, Mr Cameron has a good excuse: he is hosting the Indian Prime Minister back in the UK. But if he is to get other leaders to agree to his demands for EU reform, he needs to butter up his allies at every opportunity. No 10 have said that Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte will represent the UK at the informal EU Council. Downing Street insists this is not unusual - and they point out that the Irish are being represented by the Danes and the Czechs will represent Poland. However, there is a difference. The Irish and the Czechs are not demanding an overhaul of the EU. To make matters worse, Mr Rutte has previously warned that a British exit from the EU would be a ""killer"" for the City of London and leave the UK as a ""mid-sized economy"" in the mid-Atlantic. Allies of Mr Cameron will point out that the informal meeting isn't about EU reform, but about the migration crisis. That may be true. However, Europe may be more amenable to accommodating awkward British demands if they are persuaded that the UK is playing a full part in an even bigger crisis hitting the continent."

Activists in the IS stronghold said they counted 14 airstrikes between 11.51pm and midnight on Thursday. They reported that one of the first missiles targeted a car near the city's Islamic court - but the area was closed off by militants to prevent anyone from approaching.  Eyewitnesses in Raqqa told Sky News Jihadi John - real name Mohammed Emwazi - was taken to hospital after the strike, with IS claiming he was injured but still alive. Although the official line from IS leaders is that Emwazi survived, locals told Sky the hospital has since been closed to the public and claimed this only happens when a senior militant has been killed. Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook confirmed the strike was directed at Emwazi but said it was not clear whether he had been killed. ""We are assessing the results of tonight's operation and will provide additional information as and where appropriate,"" he said. However, a senior US defence official told Fox News: ""We are 99% sure we got him. We were on him for some time."" Another source told ABC News Emwazi was blown up in a ""flawless"" and ""clean hit"". :: Profile Of Mohammed Emwazi Prime Minister David Cameron will make a statement on the airstrike later, No 10 said. A spokesperson added: ""We have been working hand in glove with the Americans to defeat ISIL and to hunt down those murdering hostages. ""The Prime Minister has said before that tracking down these brutal murderers was a top priority."" UK-based monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said three other foreign IS fighters may have been killed with Emwazi. The group's director Rami Abdulrahman said: ""A car carrying four foreign Islamic State leaders, including one British Jihadi was hit by US airstrikes right after the governorate building in Raqqa city."" ""All the sources there are saying that the body of an important British Jihadi is lying in the hospital of Raqqa. All the sources are saying it is of Jihadi John but I cannot confirm it personally."" Jihadi John was first seen in a video in August 2014 which showed the beheading of US journalist James Foley. He had his face covered. The extremist appeared in a number of beheading videos, including those in which UK hostages Alan Henning and David Haines were killed. He also appeared in videos showing the killings of American journalist Steven Sotloff, aid worker Abdul-Rahman Kassig and Japanese journalist Kenji Goto. It was only revealed in February 2015 that he had lived in the UK since he was six years old. Emwazi and three other IS captors with British accents - whose identities have not been made public - were nicknamed ""the Beatles"" by some of their captives. The US airstrike may have also hit another member of the group, the Washington Post reported. The mother of Emwazi's first victim told ABC News his potential death would be ""really a small solace to us"". Diane Foley said: ""This huge effort to go after the this deranged man filled with hate when they can't make half that effort to save the hostages while these young Americans were still alive."" Alan Henning's nephew Stuart Henning tweeted: ""Mixed feelings today wanted the coward behind the mask to suffer the way Alan and his friends did but also glad it's been detroyed."""

A jury reached the verdict on Thursday at the federal racketeering trial of 80-year-old Vincent Asaro. The ageing gangster was accused of helping plan the 1978 Lufthansa robbery at New York's Kennedy Airport - the largest cash theft in US history. Prosecutors used wiretap recordings and testimony from Mafia turncoats in their bid to take down Asaro. Among those to testify was Asaro's cousin, Gaspare Valenti. Asaro was arrested by federal agents last year He told jurors that Asaro and Lucchese crime family associate James ""Jimmy The Gent"" Burke - portrayed by Robert De Niro in Martin Scorsese's 1990 blockbuster - killed a suspected informant with a dog chain in 1969. Valenti also testified Asaro drafted him for the Lufthansa heist, telling him, ""Burke has a big score at the airport coming up, and you're invited to go"". The Lufthansa heist was dramatised in the 1990 film Goodfellas Prosecutors said Asaro gave Burke his blessing for the robbery, which took place on what was considered Bonanno turf. They also claimed he collected at least $500,000 from the heist, but still complained about not getting what he thought was his fair share. In one wiretap recording played in court, Asaro was heard saying, ""We never got our right money, what we were supposed to get. ... Jimmy kept everything."" Prosecutors said Asaro gambled away much of the money he received from the score. Asaro's defence lawyers said prosecutors relied on shoddy testimony from ageing gangsters with incentives to lie. It was reported that Valenti turned on his cousin because he was cheated out of his cut from the airport heist."

Matthews, Becky's stepbrother, was found guilty of murdering the 16-year-old during a sexually motivated kidnap plot. She disappeared from home in Bristol on 19 February and her dismembered body was found in a shed. Courtney Bicker, who had gone on holiday with them, said: ""She told me quite a few times, in her own words, how he had graphically described how he would kill her and she was quite scared of that. ""It was quite disturbing to her. Gallery: Couple Killed Bristol Teenager Becky Watts Becky Watts, 16, disappeared from her home in Bristol on 19 February. Her dismembered remains were found on 2 March ""Obviously she was not that scared to still be near him."" Courtney also said Matthews had a ""morbid sense of humour"". ""I didn't think anything of it at the time. I just thought it was the way he was,"" she said. She said when Becky chipped her toenail, Matthews talked about ""ripping it out"". Courtney described Becky as ""a really good friend, very generous and kind"". Matthews' girlfriend Shauna Hoare, 21, was cleared of Becky's murder, but found guilty of manslaughter. A jury decided the pair had devised the kidnap plot. Courtney told Sky News: ""I wish they were both found guilty of murder. I was scared she (Hoare) may not be found guilty at all. ""Everybody could tell she was lying through her teeth but I was afraid there wasn't enough evidence against her. ""But obviously there was and the jury saw through her lies and now she's going to be sentenced hopefully for a very long time."" During the trial, Matthews told the jury he had gone to Becky's house armed with a ""kidnap kit"" including tape, a mask, a stun gun and handcuffs. However, a struggle ensued when he went into Becky's bedroom, which led to her death. Detectives have said the truth about what happened to Becky, who was suffocated by Matthews, may never be known. The 28-year-old drove Becky's body to the home he shared with Hoare, where he dismembered her in the bath before packing the remains in bags and boxes and moving them to the shed. Matthews had insisted Hoare was not involved. At Bristol Crown Court on Wednesday, both defendants were emotionless as the verdicts were read out, and the judge said sentencing would be passed at 10am on Friday. Matthews faces a mandatory life sentence, but could die behind bars as the sexually motivated murder of a child can carry a whole-life term."

Gayle Newland claimed she was a man called Kye Fortune and wore bandages across her chest to fool her friend, Chester Crown Court heard in September. The couple had sex some 10 times before the complainant took off her blindfold and discovered that 'Kye' was actually Newland and she was wearing a prosthetic penis. The 25-year-old, who had been convicted of three counts of sexual assault in September, had been accused of having ""serious personality issues"" by Judge Roger Dutton. She admitted creating a fake Facebook profile in the name of Kye Fortune, but she claimed her accuser always knew she was pretending to be a man. Newland had told the court it was part of role play because they both struggled with their sexuality. 'Kye' sent a Facebook friend request to the complainant, who cannot be named, and the pair went on to talk for ""hundreds"" of hours over the phone, with Newland disguising her voice. Newland was sentenced to eight years in prison 'Kye' told the woman 'he' had been involved in a car accident and was diagnosed with a brain tumour, claiming that due to hospital treatment it was not possible to meet in person. Then 'Kye' ""introduced"" the complainant to ""best friend"" Newland and they met in person and became close. The complainant said she would sit blindfolded as the pair watched TV and sunbathed together. She told the court: ""Every time I met up with Kye Fortune I either had the mask on already or he would wait outside the door and I would put it on. ""I was so desperate to be loved. It's pathetic, so desperate for love, so desperate."" Newland's legal team argued the complainant's account was simply ""impossible to believe"" and that a woman of her sexual experience could not have been tricked into thinking she had had sex with a man. Judge Dutton said: ""These offences are so serious that only an immediate custodial sentence would in any way properly reflect the serious nature of your conduct. ""As an aspect of mercy I do not increase the starting point beyond eight years."" Newland was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment for each count, all to run concurrently."

European authorities said they have successfully destroyed the Norway-based terror cell after police in Italy issued 17 arrest warrants for Iraqi Kurds across Europe. Italian police said Najmaddin Faraj Ahmad, who was jailed in Norway last month for praising the Charlie Hebdo killings, was the ideological leader of the group.   Norwegian media is reporting that he and two others are suspected of involvement in an alleged terror plot in Italy. The investigation monitored internet chats with members of the cell who were spread across, Britain, Finland, Germany, Greece, Italy, Norway and Sweden.  It is understood that none of the four men arrested in the UK are British nationals. The men aged 38, 32, 33 and 52, were held at addresses in Hull, Derby, Birmingham and Sheffield and will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court.  Britain's North East Counter Terrorism Unit said: ""We understand that people may be concerned following today's arrests, however we would like to reassure communities that today's activity is as a result of an ongoing investigation which is intelligence-led.

That all changed when, following surgery to remove a large ovarian cyst, I was diagnosed as menopausal. I'd already had my left ovary removed when I was 12 due to an ovarian cyst, so the doctors attempted to save part of my right ovary. :: Thousands More Women Could Be Offered HRT However, a few days after leaving hospital, I started experiencing severe menopausal symptoms. Hot flushes are horrendous: anyone who tells you ""it's all in your mind"" or ""just cool yourself down"" has clearly never experienced the feeling of your head heating up from the inside. I used to try to hide the fact that I was having a hot flush. I'd escape to the bathroom when I was out with my friends whenever I felt a hot flush coming on so they wouldn't realise what was happening. The other symptoms of insomnia, headaches, forgetfulness and generally feeling really emotional were difficult to cope with, so I visited my GP for advice and was given a leaflet aimed at women in their fifties on “Coping with the Menopause”. Three months after my operation I had a blood test that confirmed I had very high FSH levels and low oestrogen levels. My consultant advised me that my ovary was dead and I was diagnosed as surgically menopausal. At first I found this diagnosis very hard to cope with and I felt like it defined everything about me. I started noticing my friends and family avoiding to talk about pregnancy and babies in front of me. This diagnosis can be incredibly isolating as people find it uncomfortable to talk about and there is little awareness, even among doctors, of premature menopause. Joining the Daisy Network charity was a turning point for me. Meeting other women who had been through this made me realise I wasn't on my own and all the information and support offered was more than I got from any doctor. I was initially apprehensive about taking HRT as I had heard of the many risks associated with it. When I started taking HRT, all of my symptoms stopped within a few days and I returned to feeling like my normal, healthy self. For me, the benefits of HRT firmly outweigh the risks. I hope that the launch of these NICE guidelines today mean that women in the future are diagnosed and offered the right treatment quickly and provided with the support and information they need. :: Anyone who would like more information about Premature Ovarian Insufficiency (otherwise known as Premature Menopause) or the Daisy Network should visit www.daisynetwork.org.uk."

It is a treatment used to replace the falling levels of the female hormones oestrogen and progesterone that go with menopause, says Dr Ellie Cannon, when a woman’s ovaries stop producing an egg every four weeks. The treatment relieves the symptoms of the menopause, such as hot flushes, insomnia, mood swings, vaginal dryness and bladder problems, and allows the body to function normally again. :: What is HRT made from? Some drugs are derived from the urine of pregnant mares, says Dr Cannon, others are synthetic variations of human hormones, with a wide range of tablets, patches, gels and creams. :: How do you take it? Tablets are taken orally on a daily basis like the contraceptive pill, says Dr Cannon. A patch that can be stuck on the skin is also available, as well as an oestrogen gel which is absorbed through the skin. Small pellets of oestrogen may also be implanted under the skin of your stomach, bottom or thighs. ::What are the side effects? Possible side effects include bloating, headaches, nausea, breast tenderness or swelling, depression, indigestion and fluid retention. :: What are the benefits and risks? Taking HRT can help relieve and control menopausal symptoms and improve a menopausal woman’s quality of life as a result. It can also cut the risk of developing osteoporosis and cancer of the colon and rectum. However, combined HRT slightly increases the risk of developing certain cancers - breast, ovarian and womb - and strokes. Systemic HRT also increases the risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and suffering a pulmonary embolism (blockage in the pulmonary artery)."

He went to St Mary Magdalene Church of England primary school in Maida Vale before moving to Quintin Kynaston community academy in St John's Wood. A man who went to school with him described Emwazi as peculiar and violent as a youngster. Preferring to remain anonymous, he told Sky News that Emwazi ""got into some fights"" and smoked, but there was nothing in his secondary school that could have left him radicalised. However, he said there was potential for him to be groomed because he kept himself to himself and did not make eye contact. Emwazi studied at the University of Westminster between 2006 and 2009, earning a computer programming degree. At the age of 21 he worked as a salesman at an IT company in Kuwait. His ex-boss told The Guardian newspaper: ""He was the best employee we ever had. ""He was very good with people. Calm and decent. He came to our door and gave us his CV."" ""How could someone as calm and quiet as him become like the man who we saw on the news? It’s just not logical that he could be this guy."" Emwazi left the company suddenly in April 2010 after returning to London. Further details about the killer came as emails emerged suggesting Emwazi considered suicide when he was a student, after suspecting MI5 was closing in on him. He told a journalist in 2010 that he felt like a ""dead man walking"". Emwazi had also contacted a campaign group after he was questioned by counter-terrorism officers while attempting to fly from Heathrow to his native Kuwait in 2010. In August 2013 his parents reported him missing and just months later they were told by police he had travelled to Syria. Emwazi rose to notoriety in August 2014 when he appeared in an IS video in which he killed American journalist James Foley. Since then he has appeared in a series of videos documenting the gruesome murders of other hostages, including British aid workers Alan Henning and David Haines."

Nevertheless, he was still being stopped in the street 40 years on by fans who thought he really was like Garnett. He once admitted some similarities, saying: ""Opinionated male chauvinistic pig at times, I suppose.

Mitchell - born Warren Misell - served in the Royal Air Force and then went on to read physics at University College, Oxford. He left the course early and took up acting in 1951 at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. His role as Alf Garnett was his big break, and the character became much-loved by the British public. Mitchell - an ardent Tottenham Hotspur fan, unlike West Ham-supporting Garnett - also appeared in Lovejoy, Waking The Dead, Kavanagh QC and Gormenghast. He received critical acclaim for performances in Arthur Miller's Death Of A Salesman and Harold Pinter's The Caretaker."

Revellers clambered over each other to escape the Lava and Ignite venue in Northampton as more than a dozen announcements were made between 3.10am and 3.50am on 19 October, 2011. There was a log-jam of people rushing for doors as coaches came to collect clubbers from the Wickedest Wickedest R'n'B event and take them home, an inquest heard. Amid ""manic"" scenes, Nabila Nanfuka, 22, and Laurene-Danielle Jackson, 19, both from London, were killed. Both were found unconscious inside the club with Ms Nanfuka's cause of death given as traumatic asphyxia and Ms Jackson as cerebral ischaemia - a lack of blood flow to the brain - and traumatic asphyxia. Around 1,600 people were at the venue and cloakroom staff stopped taking coats and bags, so clubbers threw their belongings over the counter, and many items were not properly ticketed, the inquest heard. Some items took up to 10 minutes to get back at the end of the night, assistant coroner Belinda Cheney said. The foreman of the jury said: ""We believe the safe exit from the club was not adequately considered by the promoters and the club."" She said 14 announcements were made in 30 minutes and this was ""the most significant factor that caused the overcrowding in the vestibule and the crush on the stairs"". A fire alarm also went off at 3.49am which added to the number of people trying to leave with one witness saying revellers were ""left screaming, crying and moaning"". Ms Cheney said she hoped club promoters and venues would ""learn lessons from this tragedy"", as she reached a narrative verdict for the deaths. The Crown Prosecution Service previously determined there would be no criminal charges brought against anyone following the incident."

The French president was attending a friendly international between France and Germany at the Stade de France when the first loud explosion was heard at the stadium - many thought it was just a firework. Moments later, at around 9.30pm, a presidential security official reportedly passed on a message from the prefect of Seine-Saint-Denis: ""The Quick has blown up."" The Quick fast food restaurant, just outside one of the stadium's main gates, had just been attacked by a suicide bomber. Police outside a Quick restaurant targeted by a suicide bomber :: How The Attacks Unfolded Hollande left soon after - along with Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve - for the crisis room in the Interior Ministry. He was joined there by Prime Minister Manuel Valls, with the atmosphere so sensitive they were even briefing the president in hushed tones, according to Le Parisien newspaper. The image is reminiscent of the moment George Bush learned of 9/11 :: Live - France In Mourning Leading Socialist politician Claude Bartolone said Mr Hollande ""never lost his cool"". Mr Hollande delivered the first of several televised addresses to the nation as Mr Valls, Mr Cazeneuve and the two other ministers central to national security - justice minister Christiane Taubira and defence minister Jean-Yves Le Drian - waited in his office. At 4am, Mr Hollande took a call from President Obama offering his support - followed closely by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister David Cameron.

Some of the the victims' names have been made public, but many relatives are still desperately waiting to hear news of loved ones. Among the victims of the Bataclan attack was a lawyer who was a graduate of the London School of Economics. Valentin Ribet, 26, specialised in white collar crime and worked in the Paris office of Hogan Lovells. The international law firm said Mr Ribet was ""a talented lawyer, extremely well liked, and a wonderful personality in the office.""

Another of the Paris victims was American Nohemi Gonzalez, a 23-year-old design student at California State University, who was spending a semester at Strate College of Design in France. And France international footballer Lassana Diarra also said his cousin Asta Diakite was killed in the attacks. In a tribute, the former Chelsea and Arsenal midfielder said: ""She was like a big sister to me. ""In this climate of terror, it is important for all of us who represent our country and its diversity to stay united against a horror which has no colour, no religion. Stand together for love, respect and peace."" Diarra was playing against Germany when terrorists targeted the Stade De France in suicide attacks. Among others who lost their lives were Djamila Houd, 41, of Paris, who was reportedly killed in a cafe, and Alberto Gonzalez Garrido, 29, of Madrid, who died at the Bataclan. Mathieu Hoche, 38, a technician at France24 news channel, and writer Guillame Decherf, 43, were also killed at the concert. Decherf was a writer who covered rock music for the French culture magazine Les Inrocks. Two weeks ago he published a piece about the Eagles of Death Metal's latest album. He had two daughters. Briton Nick Alexander, described by family and friends as ""generous, funny and fiercely loyal"", was killed at the Bataclan. Mr Alexander had been selling merchandise for rock band Eagles of Death Metal when their concert was targeted by the attackers. A number of friends and relatives of those reported missing have appealed for information on Twitter about their loved ones using the hashtag #rechercheParis. Georges Salines tweeted a number of appeals for his daughter Lola Salines, but later confirmed she was among the victims. ""Thanks to everyone who helped us today,"" he said. Friends had also been searching for Maud Serrault, a marketing director at Best Western. They later said she was among the victims of the Bataclan attack. Chile's foreign ministry said two Chileans died in the attacks: Luis Felipe Zschoche Valle, a 33-year-old who had lived in Paris for eight years with his French wife, and 61-year-old Patricia San Martin, described as a Chilean exile. Ms San Martin's daughter, 35-year-old French citizen Elsa Veronique Delplace San Martin, also died. They were all killed at the Bataclan. Marie Lausch and her boyfriend Mathias Dymarski were also killed at the concert. Friends held a vigil in Metx after the news filtered through. One said: Their love of life, that's what sums them up best."" Friends Pierre Innocenti and Stephane Albertini were also killed at the Bataclan. The pair ran an Italian restaurant in Neuilly-sur-Scene frequented by PSG football stars. The men were childhood friends with Mr Bean actor Emma de Caunes, who wrote on Instagram: ""I'll always remember them and their fantastic love of life and freedom... ""Even though we weren't that close anymore , they'll always stay in my heart forever."" Valeria Solesin, 28, from Venice was killed in the Bataclan theatre. She was with her Italian boyfriend and other friends, who survived.  Her mother said she was a ""wonderful person"", who had lived in Paris for six years and studied at the Sorbonne. The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for the atrocities, which have been described as ""an act of barbarism"" by Paris prosecutor Francois Molins."

Mr Justice Dingemans became emotional as he started paying tribute to Becky's family in court. Matthews, 28, was jailed for a minimum of 33 years for murder after he suffocated his stepsister in her bedroom following a sexually motivated kidnap plot. The 16-year-old suffered more than 40 injuries to her body as she fought for her life in Bristol on 19 February. Mr Justice Dingemans was in tears at the end of sentencing Matthews' girlfriend, Hoare, 21, was convicted of Becky's manslaughter at the city's crown court. Both were found guilty of kidnap, perverting the course of justice, preventing a lawful burial and possessing two stun gun torches. The judge said: ""In my judgment the appropriate sentence for Mr Matthews is a mandatory life sentence with a minimum term of 33 years. ""This means that Mr Matthews, as a 28-year-old man, will be 61 before he might be considered for release and the reality is that he might never be released."" After Becky was killed, Matthews and Hoare then bundled her body into their car before driving it to their home where it would later be dismembered in their bathroom. The remains were then hidden in a nearby shed where they were eventually discovered on 2 March. In a victim impact statement read out in court, Becky's father Darren Galsworthy, whose wife Anjie is Matthews' mother, said: ""The heartless, cold manner of this despicable act of evil can never be forgiven or forgotten."" He added: ""Becky was so small and fragile she never stood a chance."" He said when police told him that her body parts had been found ""it's like being cast off a cliff into the bottomless depth of despair and non-belief"". He also said not only did the killers cruelly rob 5ft 1in Becky of life, they also took her dignity in death and did this on her brother Danny's 20th birthday. In another statement, Becky's mother Tanya Watts said the thought of her daughter being dismembered was ""always on her mind"". There was ""nothing to celebrate anymore, not without Becky"", she added. Ms Watts said the teenager had been ""robbed of her future"", adding: ""I keep thinking about Becky...and I am furious"". ""Becky must have been so scared...knowing that her last moments must have been filled with fear,"" she went on. A six-week trial heard Matthews and Hoare planned to kidnap her as a part of a sexually motivated plot based on their shared interest in pretty, petite teenagers. The couple, who fantasised about bringing a teenage girl to the attic of their squalid home, had packed a kidnap kit in the boot of their Vauxhall Zafira. CCTV shows Matthews buying a circular saw the day after murdering Becky - staff say he even haggled over the price. Former police officer and lecturer in criminology at the University of Gloucestershire, Dr Jane Monkton Smith, said he showed behaviour commonly seen in serial killers. She said: ""I would say that puts him somewhere on the psychopathic spectrum and that ability to be able to behave completely normally after you've done something which is absolutely abhorrent is very worrying and is the kind of behaviour that we normally see more in serial killers."""

The bombers hit a jihadi recruitment centre, training camp and arms depot run by the extremist group, according to the French defence ministry. A spokesman described it as a ""massive"" attack and France's biggest to date in Syria. French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said France had the ""legitimacy"" to take action against IS after the terror attacks in Paris which left 132 people dead. He said the decision to conduct airstrikes was a ""political"" one and that France had to be ""present and active"" following the atrocity. :: Moment Hollande Learns Paris Is Under Attack The aerial raid was launched from air bases in United Arab Emirates and Jordan, and involved France's 12 fighter bombers based there.

""The coalition has a number of targets of opportunity, targets provided by intelligence.

An apologetic no-show at your local church fete is one thing. Failing to turn up to a heads of government meeting when you need a big favour from them is something else entirely. David Cameron has made his excuses at the first meeting of EU leaders since he outlined his demands for reform ahead of the referendum on Britain's membership. Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, has called an informal meeting to discuss the migration crisis held directly after the Valletta summit in Malta. The British Prime Minister has already flown home. To be fair, Mr Cameron has a good excuse: he is hosting the Indian Prime Minister back in the UK. But if he is to get other leaders to agree to his demands for EU reform, he needs to butter up his allies at every opportunity. No 10 have said that Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte will represent the UK at the informal EU Council. Downing Street insists this is not unusual - and they point out that the Irish are being represented by the Danes and the Czechs will represent Poland. However, there is a difference. The Irish and the Czechs are not demanding an overhaul of the EU. To make matters worse, Mr Rutte has previously warned that a British exit from the EU would be a ""killer"" for the City of London and leave the UK as a ""mid-sized economy"" in the mid-Atlantic. Allies of Mr Cameron will point out that the informal meeting isn't about EU reform, but about the migration crisis. That may be true. However, Europe may be more amenable to accommodating awkward British demands if they are persuaded that the UK is playing a full part in an even bigger crisis hitting the continent."

At one point the terrorists were outside the door, and the pair could hear them communicating in French. Mariesha and Christine at the concert before the attack What began as an enjoyable Friday evening - meeting up with old friends for a concert - quickly turned into a terrifying ordeal as they saw the first of the terrorists' bullets hit the stage. Ms Tudhope said: ""(It was) one round, in very quick succession. It stopped. People gasped, thinking it was part of the show, and then a second round went off. ""Most people ducked, our instinct was to duck. I just said 'run, just get out of here'. We were close to an exit, we just ran."" Amid the confusion they managed to run into a cellar, but said they quickly realised they were trapped. Then the door burst open. Ms Payne said: ""We just thought they're coming, we're going to die. ""It was two other concert goers."" Together they barricaded themselves in and turned off the lights. For the next three hours they had to listen to what was happening on the floor of the concert hall. ""We heard everything above going on: bullets, grenades, explosions, screams, we could hear it,"" Ms Tudhope told Sky Correspondent James Matthews. ""I think we were directly under the stage area. ""At one point we could hear the terrorists on their walkie talkies. ""We weren't sure who they were speaking to, but the two Italian guys (who were with them in the cellar) spoke French and told us they had said they had hostages and they were speaking to the police. ""But they wouldn't tell us what else they said. They just said it was best we didn't know."" Shortly after midnight, French police stormed the building. One of the gunmen was shot dead, while the other two blew themselves up. More than 80 of the hostages were killed. When the officers reached the cellar and freed those inside, the hostages were told not to look down. Police shielded them from the full scale of the terror as they were escorted outside, searched and taken to the safety of a nearby apartment building. ""We (in the cellar) all got out safe, that's the main thing.

Salah Abdeslam, 26, reportedly helped with logistics and rented a black Volkswagen Polo used by the gunmen who stormed the Bataclan concert hall and killed at least 89 people on Friday night. He was apparently spoken to by officers on Saturday morning when they pulled over a car carrying three people near the Belgian border. Police then checked Abdeslam's ID and subsequently let him go, officials told the Associated Press. The incident came just hours after authorities had identified him as the person who rented the Polo which was abandoned at the scene of the attack. One of his brothers, Ibrahim Abdeslam, was reportedly among the seven suicide bombers in the co-ordinated assaults targeting six sites across the French capital. A third brother was apparently arrested in Belgium and questioned before being released. Salah Abdeslam, who was born in Brussels, is described as 1m 75cm (5ft 8in) tall and has brown eyes. Police released a photo of him and warned the public he is dangerous and said ""do not intervene yourself"". There are reports he may have fled to Spain. Another man, Bilal Hadfi, has been named as among the attackers and he also lived in Belgium as did Salah and Ibrahim Abdeslam, said the Washington Post. Ismael Omar Mostefai, a 29-year-old man from Courcouronnes, a town 16 miles south of Paris in Essonne, has been officially identified as another assailant. He was one of the terrorists inside the Bataclan, where a rock concert was taking place, and had been flagged for links to Islamic radicalism. His father and brother have been arrested. French newspaper Le Monde said he was identified from a print from his severed finger, discovered after he detonated a suicide vest inside the Bataclan. He had a criminal record and was known to security services but had not spent time in jail or been linked to any extremist groups.

A total of 132 people were killed and 352 injured during the gun and bomb rampage carried out by three teams in identical explosives vests who targeted the hall, restaurants and bars and the national stadium.  In other developments: :: Police have carried out raids in five locations Bobigny and Saint-Denis in Paris, Toulouse, Grenoble and Jeumont. :: A suicide attacker at the stadium has been identified as a French national living in Belgium, as was a man who attacked a restaurant. They were aged 20 and 31, say authorities. :: At least seven people have now been detained in Belgium and on the Belgian-French border, but Belgian officials have declined to comment on reports the attacks were largely planned in Brussels. :: A French citizen is among three people detained at the Belgian border, while others were held in police raids in Molenbeek, an immigrant area of Brussels. :: Three Kalashnikov assault rifles were discovered inside a Seat car reportedly used in the attacks against bars and restaurants and which was found in the suburb of Montreuil, four miles east of Paris. :: Paris Attacks - Who Are The Victims? Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel said at least one of those held in Molenbeek was thought to have spent the previous night in Paris. Molenbeek has been connected with two attacks in France this year - the Islamist killer at a kosher shop in Paris in January got his guns in the district, as did the attacker overpowered on a Brussels-Paris train in August. Islamic State has claimed responsibility for Friday's near-simultaneous attacks, which it blamed on France's involvement in the US-led airstrikes on IS territory in Syria and Iraq. The assailants were heard speaking of both countries during the atrocities. French jets have launched fresh aerial raids on the IS stronghold of Raqqa, Syria, following the tragedy. :: The Foreign Office says those concerned about British nationals caught up in the Paris attacks should call 020 7008 0000 :: Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs says anyone concerned about Irish nationals caught up in the attacks should call 01 408 2000"

The warning came in a statement issued by the Government, which has been working with airlines to fly travellers back following the plane crash on 21 October in which 224 people died. Airlines have for more than a week been organising for tourists - and their luggage - to be returned to the UK with extra security while restrictions at the Egyptian airport are tightened. But the last of those flights will be on Tuesday and, after that, holidaymakers will have to ""make their own alternative arrangements for returning to the UK"". The statement added: ""This may involve having to travel with an airline to which enhanced UK security measures, eg separate baggage flights, do not apply. ""Travellers are advised that they do so at their own risk."" Flights from the UK were suspended on 4 November after the Airbus 321 operated by Russian airline Metrojet crashed. David Cameron has said it was ""more likely than not"" that the plane was blown up by a bomb. More than 13,000 passengers have since been repatriated since flights resumed on 6 November. Most of the passengers are expected to return by the end of the weekend with some extra flights being put on to make sure there is space for everyone to get home by Tuesday. Airlines say fewer than 200 people are expected to stay in the resort after that."

Sam Donley stabbed close friend Liam Miller 32 times after they took a ""potent and dangerous"" hallucinogenic drug called N-bomb. Donley, from York, also attacked passer-by Theophilos Theophilou during the incident in July, Leeds Crown Court heard. He told detectives he felt like he was in a dream and thought Mr Miller was a skull. He said he thought he had to stab the 20-year-old to return to the real world. Donley was the frontman and Mr Miller the guitarist in a York-based rock band called Nocebo. The pair had been close friends since they were 16 and decided to experiment with LSD and the similar Class A drug 25i-NBOMe at Donley's home while his parents were away. Shortly before Donley attacked his friend with a kitchen knife, Mr Miller sent a message on Facebook, saying: ""My mate is bad, what do I do?"" Mr Miller, from Terrington, near Malton, North Yorkshire, was found lying by the gates of the house by Mr Theophilou. Mr Theophilou tried to help as Donley crouched over his friend and stabbed him again several times. Donley then chased Mr Theophilou and attacked him until a neighbour intervened and kept the musician in his house, where he began to stab himself in the throat. Nicholas Lumley QC, mitigating, described the case as a ""tragedy"" and read out a letter Donley wrote to the judge. ""No outcome could possibly be worse than knowing my best friend, who I adored, has gone and I will regret that for the rest of my life,"" he wrote. Donley was jailed for six years and eight months after pleading guilty to manslaughter. He was given a concurrent sentence of 32 months for wounding Mr Theophilou. Judge Peter Collier QC told him: ""You bear the responsibility for the death of your close friend Liam Miller and also for the injuries caused to Mr Theophilou, an innocent passer-by."" He added: ""It all resulted from a deliberate decision made by you when you were sober and when you were rational. It was a decision to take a hallucinogenic drug."" N-bomb is a synthetic, psychedelic drug that was discovered in 2003. It was made a Class A drug in the UK in 2014, and has been linked to at least 17 deaths in the US."

He was introduced on stage by British Prime Minister David Cameron, who described Friday night's rally as a ""truly historic moment"". Mr Cameron said: ""Prime minister Modi, you can see what I see everyday - British Indians putting the great into Great Britain. ""It won't be long before there's a British Indian prime minister in Downing Street."" Mr Modi had lunch with the Queen at Buckingham Palace on Friday. Earlier in the day, the Indian Prime Minister had lunch with the Queen at Buckingham Palace. It was followed by an announcement by Kensington Palace that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge would be visiting India for the first time next spring. The organiser of the Wembley rally, Niravta Mathur, told Sky News earlier in the day that the event was a sell-out and would feature dance acts and music ""celebrating India and its arts"". The first UK visit by an Indian prime minister for a decade has so far seen around £9bn worth of trade deals agreed between the two nations. Thursday's announcement was described by Mr Modi as a ""huge moment for our two great nations"". Deals included a £1.3bn investment in India by Vodafone. British Prime Minister David Cameron has pledged to create a ""modern, dynamic partnership"" with India. However, Mr Modi's visit has also triggered protests outside Downing Street over human rights issues in India. Mr Modi's government has been accused of undermining democracy and the leader, who became PM last year, is regarded as controversial in some quarters."

Giving a statement outside 10 Downing Street the Prime Minister added that Britain and her allies would not rest until the ""poisonous death cult"" of Islamic State was defeated. It comes as US intelligence said it was ""99% sure"" the targeted strike had killed British militant Mohammed Emwazi. Referring to Emwazi as a ""lead executioner"" for IS, also known as ISIL, Mr Cameron said he posed an ongoing and serious threat to innocent civilians and the operation was a strike ""at the heart"" of the organisation. The PM said he was waiting for official confirmation Emwazi was dead He added that although it could not be confirmed Emwazi had been killed, Britain had been working ""hand in glove"" with the US to track down the ""barbaric murderer"". ""We have a long reach, we have unwavering determination and we never forget about our citizens,"" he said, referring to British hostages kidnapped and killed by IS. ""I want to pay tribute to all those professionals in our own security and intelligence agencies and Armed Forces for the extraordinary work they do on behalf of our country. ""I want to thank the United States. We have no better friend or ally. ""Today though, my thoughts, and the thoughts of our country, are with the families of those who were so brutally murdered.

Mr Cameron also paid tribute to murdered British aid workers Alan Henning and David Haines who he described as ""the best of British."" :: How Spy Agencies Find Their Targets The PM added his thoughts were with their families and friends who should be proud of their ""courage and selflessness"" which he said stood ""in stark contrast to the empty callousness of their murderers"". ""(Emwazi) was shown in those sickening videos of the beheadings of British aid workers,"" Mr Cameron said. ""He posed an ongoing and serious threat to innocent civilians not only in Syria, but around the world, and in the United Kingdom too. ""The threat ISIL poses continues."" Sky's Senior Political Correspondent Sophy Ridge said: ""David Cameron wanted to put Britain at the centre of the US action against Emwazi - or as near to it as possible. ""Emwazi's death - if confirmed - may not be significant strategically in the fight against IS, who has many more militants. ""But it's impossible to overstate its importance politically and emotionally to the UK, where for many he has become the symbol of IS at its most murderous."" In contrast to Mr Cameron, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""It appears Mohammed Emwazi has been held to account for his callous and brutal crimes. However, it would have been far better for us all if he had been held to account in a court of law."" Dr Adnan Siddiqui, the director of advocacy group CAGE that admitted it made mistakes over its handling of Emwazi, said: ""Killing Emwazi is evidence that the US and UK do not consider the families of hostages in their actions. ""This is backed up by reports that US authorities threatened families if they negotiated payment of ransom money. ""Emwazi's execution of defenceless hostages was inexcusable. But all avenues that led him to that point need to be investigated."""
2015-11-16,"The Government's decision to sell billions of pounds worth of loans to a US private investment firm will affect 125,000 homeowners who took out mortgages with failed bank Northern Rock.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151116073021/http://news.sky.com/story/1587033/bank-asset-sale-125000-borrowers-affected,"The Government's decision to sell billions of pounds worth of loans to a US private investment firm will affect 125,000 homeowners who took out mortgages with failed bank Northern Rock. Borrowers will receive letters telling them that the companies behind their mortgages have changed, with 34,000 going to TSB - now owned by Spain's Banco de Sabadell - and the remaining 91,000 in the hands of US private investment firm Cerberus Capital. The latter takes its name from the mythological three-headed dog that guards the gates of hell. But personal finance experts do not believe there is reason for borrowers to fear that New York-based outfit will try to squeeze more from the assets, or ramp up repossessions. These mortgages will continue to be serviced by UK Asset Resolution, the body that has managed them on the Government's behalf since Northern Rock's bail-out. Experts point to the fact that the deals remain subject to the auspices of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), with strict rules on forbearance - giving borrowers a chance when they are struggling to meet repayments. Meanwhile UKAR said the terms and conditions of the mortgages would not change. It added that a key consideration in selecting the bidder was the fair treatment of customers - though neither Cerberus nor UKAR would specify what this meant. But why would Cerberus want to buy these loans if it does not plan to squeeze them? The company did not comment about the commercial rationale behind the deal, but there are other reasons why it might find these mortgages attractive assets. Ray Boulger, senior technical manager at independent mortgage broker John Charcol, said most of those borrowers who still had old Northern Rock loans were likely to be paying interest rates of 4.79% - far higher than deals currently on the market. This results in a chunky profit margin for the lender - who will be able to finance the loan book much more cheaply in the current low interest rate environment. Since they have not switched to a rival deal these customers are also more likely to be ""sticky"" - that is, less inclined to move to another lender - and this will not necessarily be because they find it difficult to pay. It could be for example because their remaining loans are small, because they are interest-only or because they self-certified their income for the purposes of obtaining their loans. Mr Charcol said he did not think borrowers had anything to worry about. ""If the Government hadn't made sure that the sale terms require lenders to treat customers fairly, they would have been under all sorts of criticism,"" he said."

Downing Street says they had all been subject to ""rigorous"" security checks before being approved for relocation. It came after reports at least one of the bombers in last Friday's attacks may have entered Europe through Greece posing as a refugee from Syria. The new arrivals in Scotland - around 15 families - are all from camps surrounding Syria and will be given five-year visas. They were met by representatives of five Scottish local authorities who will help them settle, following the flight from Amman in Jordan. Some will start a new life on the Isle of Bute. David Cameron pledged in September to take in 20,000 Syrian refugees by the end of the current parliament in 2020. Millions have been displaced from their country due to the four-year civil war. Since the Prime Minister's announcement a ""steady stream"" of refugees have already come to the UK but the start of special charter flights will see the numbers rise. Mr Cameron has set a target to bring a thousand to Britain by Christmas. He said he did not want to take in those already in Europe as he did not want to encourage others to make the dangerous journey since many have already died doing so. The Home Office has confirmed offers of support from more than 45 councils around the UK, while talks are continuing with dozens more. At the weekend, Home Secretary Theresa May said those who arrive in Britain would be thoroughly screened to ensure they do not pose a terrorist threat. Richard Harrington, Minister for Syrian Refugees, said: ""Today's arrivals are a landmark moment for the vulnerable persons' resettlement scheme and the result of great collaboration between the Government, the UNHCR, local authorities and the devolved administrations. ""These vulnerable people will now have the chance to rebuild their lives in safe and secure surroundings, among supportive communities in the UK. ""Over the coming weeks we will provide refuge to hundreds more people who have been forced from their homes because of civil unrest, persecution and war."""
2015-11-19,At least 32 people have been killed and 80 injured in a night-time suicide bomb attack by Islamist extremists in Nigeria.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151119002319/http://news.sky.com/story/1589546/boko-haram-militants-kill-32-in-suicide-attack,"At least 32 people have been killed and 80 injured in a night-time suicide bomb attack by Islamist extremists in Nigeria. The assault by the group Boko Haram at a truck stop in Yola, Adamawa state, in the north east was the first terrorist attack since October when a spate of bombings killed 42 people and injured more than 100. Most of the victims were street vendors and passers-by, said Deputy Superintendent Othman Abubakar, the police spokesman for Adamawa. ""The enemies of humanity will never win. Hand in hand, we will rid our land of terrorism,"" Nigeria's defiant President Muhammadu Buhari said in a tweet. The Islamist militant group has been waging a violent uprising in Nigeria since 2009 in an attempt to establish an Islamic State, or caliphate, in the north east. Boko Haram declared a caliphate in Gwoza in March and a sharp rise in attacks this year has brought the number of people forced to flee the group's insurgency to 2.1 million. According to the UN's children agency around 1.4 million of those ""on the run"" are children. The group controlled significant swathes of territory across three states in northeastern Nigeria at the beginning of 2015 before government forces supported by Chad, Niger and Cameroon pushed it back. Now heavily splintered, Boko Haram factions have reverted to guerrilla tactics, including raiding villages for supplies and bombing soft targets such as places of worship, markets and bus stations. But while the army has freed the last few towns still under some form of Boko Haram control, many of those displaced are reluctant to return home. Analysts say Nigeria's military is struggling to maintain gains and that as it takes one area, Boko Haram moves into another in the vast arid spaces dotted by forests in the northeast. Some 20,000 people have been killed in the six-year-old Islamic uprising."

Flight AF055 from Washington Dulles and AF065 from Los Angeles were both en route to Paris Charles de Gaulle when the airline received anonymous threats after take-off.

A passenger on board AF065 snapped a photo of responding emergency crews :: Paris Siege: Terror Mastermind's Fate Unclear Intelligence agents are investigating the source of the telephone calls. It was unclear whether the warnings for both flights were from the same person. FBI agent Todd Palmer told CNN: ""Several law enforcement agencies are working to determine the nature of the threats which caused the aircraft to divert."" A passenger on the flight from Dulles, which landed safely in Halifax, Canada, with 262 passengers, said they were informed the plane was being diverted after two-and-a-half hours of flying. He said: ""Upon landing, one of the flight attendants said it was a security issue that needed to get addressed."" The Los Angeles flight, which had 497 people on board, landed safely in Utah. American authorities said they found ""no credible threat"" after searching the plane, passengers and luggage in Salt Lake City. Royal Canadian Mounted Police said no evidence of an explosive device had been uncovered during their searches. Passengers later reboarded the planes and completed their journey to Paris. The incidents were the latest in a series of security scares coming in the immediate aftermath of the deadly terrorist attacks in the French capital. On Tuesday, four people were removed from a Baltimore-to-Chicago Spirit Airlines flight after a fellow passenger reported ""suspicious activity"". Police later said the potential threat turned out to be someone watching a news report on their smartphone. Also on Tuesday, a British Airways flight from London to Boston notified police before landing that the crew had restrained a passenger who tried to open an exit door mid-flight. State Police said the female passenger was ""drunk"", and the incident had no connection to terrorism. A resort hotel at Walt Disney World in Florida was briefly evacuated on Tuesday night following an apparent bomb scare, but police found no evidence of a threat."

State terrorists in northern Iraq. A Tornado G4 patrol was able to ""guide"" a Paveway bomb on to the IS fighters near the town of Sinjar, the Ministry of Defence has revealed. The sortie, which took place on Monday, was carried out in support of an offensive by Kurdish peshmerga fighters mounted against IS in the Mosul region. An RAF Tornado fighter ""The first flight used a Paveway bomb to destroy a mortar position which had opened fire on the Kurds,"" the MoD said in a statement. ""The following mission destroyed a heavy machine gun near Mosul with a Paveway IV, then proceeded west towards Sinjar. ""There was heavy cloud, which may have encouraged the terrorists to assume that they were safe from air attack, but, working very closely with the Kurdish forces, the GR4s were able to guide a Paveway on to a large group of over 30 Daesh terrorists who were massing for a counter-attack. ""The Kurdish unit subsequently reported that the airstrike had been highly effective. ""The Tornado patrol then destroyed another Isil mortar position south-west of Sinjar."" On Sunday an RAF Reaper drone provided ""surveillance support"" to a wave of French airstrikes on the IS stronghold of Raqqa carried out in retaliation for the Paris terror attacks. RAF Tornados have also been flying in support of Iraqi government forces in the Ramadi region, carrying out a series of successful attacks on IS positions on Friday, the MoD said. :: Paris Attacks: Special Programme on Sky News Tonight with Adam Boulton from 7pm Details of the latest operations emerged as Chancellor George Osborne revealed intelligence services are developing cyber weapons to ""hit back"" at deadly hack attacks by IS. Later Prime Minister David Cameron said he was to set out a ""comprehensive strategy"" for dealing with IS, including air strikes on Syria. In the wake of the Paris attacks he said there was a ""compelling case"" for extending air strikes and that Britain ""cannot expect others to carry the burden and risks of protecting our country"".  He made the announcement after France issued what was described as an unprecedented demand for its European Union allies to support its military action against Islamic State. The French government invoked a never-before-used article of the EU's Lisbon Treaty which requires member states to provide ""aid and assistance by all the means in their power"" to a member that is ""the victim of armed aggression on its territory"". French defence minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said EU partners could help ""either by taking part in France's operations in Syria or Iraq, or by easing the load or providing support for France in other operations"". The call came as French war planes launched a second wave of strikes on Raqqa,destroying a command post and a training camp, according to a military spokesman. In an emotional address to the two French houses of parliament on Monday, president Francois Hollande pledged to build a coalition capable of defeating the jihadists at home and abroad. With at least 129 people known to have died in the Paris attacks, Mr Hollande called on the international community - led by the US and Russia - to set aside their differences over Syria to destroy IS on its home ground."

He has been charged with three offences under section 3 of the Computer Misuse Act which relates to 'denial of service' attacks. The alleged attacks are understood to have been carried out on websites in Europe, North America, Africa and Asia.

The siege in the northern Parisian suburb began shortly after 4.30am local time, with locals woken by the sound of gunfire and several loud explosions. Dozens of residents were evacuated from their homes as armed police launched the raid on the apartment, where they believe the mastermind of last Friday's terror attacks – Abdelhamid Abaaoud – was holed up inside with several heavily armed suspects. Two of the suspects have been killed, including a woman who detonated a suicide belt.

Sabrine told the newspaper she had been lying on the floor for about two-and-a-half hours by the time she was evacuated – and described how the stairwell had been destroyed and the building wrecked during the assault.

Those who live nearby have now been relocated to the city hall. Sky's Michelle Clifford, who is also in Saint Denis, said it was a challenge for police to handle the threat posed by the people inside the apartment, while also protecting the public. She added: ""Police were saying 'stay in your apartments, keep the doors shut, don't come to the windows'. ""It was clearly was a very tense situation from the start."""

Borrowers will receive letters telling them that the companies behind their mortgages have changed, with 34,000 going to TSB - now owned by Spain's Banco de Sabadell - and the remaining 91,000 in the hands of US private investment firm Cerberus Capital. The latter takes its name from the mythological three-headed dog that guards the gates of hell. But personal finance experts do not believe there is reason for borrowers to fear that New York-based outfit will try to squeeze more from the assets, or ramp up repossessions. These mortgages will continue to be serviced by UK Asset Resolution, the body that has managed them on the Government's behalf since Northern Rock's bail-out. Experts point to the fact that the deals remain subject to the auspices of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), with strict rules on forbearance - giving borrowers a chance when they are struggling to meet repayments. Meanwhile UKAR said the terms and conditions of the mortgages would not change. It added that a key consideration in selecting the bidder was the fair treatment of customers - though neither Cerberus nor UKAR would specify what this meant. But why would Cerberus want to buy these loans if it does not plan to squeeze them? The company did not comment about the commercial rationale behind the deal, but there are other reasons why it might find these mortgages attractive assets. Ray Boulger, senior technical manager at independent mortgage broker John Charcol, said most of those borrowers who still had old Northern Rock loans were likely to be paying interest rates of 4.79% - far higher than deals currently on the market. This results in a chunky profit margin for the lender - who will be able to finance the loan book much more cheaply in the current low interest rate environment. Since they have not switched to a rival deal these customers are also more likely to be ""sticky"" - that is, less inclined to move to another lender - and this will not necessarily be because they find it difficult to pay. It could be for example because their remaining loans are small, because they are interest-only or because they self-certified their income for the purposes of obtaining their loans. Mr Charcol said he did not think borrowers had anything to worry about. ""If the Government hadn't made sure that the sale terms require lenders to treat customers fairly, they would have been under all sorts of criticism,"" he said."

The Chancellor issued a stark warning that IS is plotting deadly online attacks on Britain's infrastructure - and pledged to tackle cyber crime with an additional £1.9bn a year by 2020. IS has demonstrated its ability to exploit cyberspace to spread propaganda and plan terrorist attacks, he said, and it is to be expected the group will one day target utilities and air-traffic control. David Cameron's message in Paris attacks book of condolence However, he warned hackers, terrorists, criminal gangs and rogue states that Britain is developing a system to counter cyber attacks, saying the country ""will be making sure that whoever attacks us knows we are able to hit back"". Speaking during a visit to the GCHQ listening station in Cheltenham, Mr Osborne said of the threat from IS: ""They have not been able to use it to kill people yet by attacking our infrastructure through cyber attack. ""They do not yet have that capability. But we know they want it, and are doing their best to build it. :: Risk Of Deadly IS Hack Attack 'Is Real' ""So when we talk about tackling ISIL (another name for IS), that means tackling their cyber threat as well as the threat of their guns, bombs and knives. ""If our electricity supply, or our air traffic control, or our hospitals were successfully attacked online, the impact could be measured not just in terms of economic damage but of lives lost."" And he added: "" ... we need to ensure that our military are equipped to fight the wars of the 21st century. ""That means they need to be prepared for hybrid conflicts, played out in cyberspace as well as on the battlefield. A 21st century military has to operate as effectively in cyberspace as it does on land and sea, in the air and space.""

The money will not go on recruitment, but will fund new weapons and vehicles, including helicopters. It will also help buy protective equipment and communication systems. It is a significant increase in spending on the UK's specialist soldiers and reflects the growing threat of terrorism in the UK. Meanwhile, French hackers from the activist group Anonymous have declared ""war"" on IS after the Paris attacks.

The Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings - released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) - showed women earned an average 9.4% less than men in April. That was down from a figure of 9.6% in 2014. However, the ONS said the gap had changed ""relatively little"" over the past four years. There was no change in the difference between male and female part-time workers, which remained at 19.2%. The figures were announced nine days after the so-called Equal Pay Day - used by campaigners to highlight the date in the calendar year when they say women effectively work for free because of the wage disparity. MPs are also beginning an inquiry into the Government's gender pay strategy - which includes companies with 250 employees or more being forced to report pay levels for male and female workers. The work of the Women and Equalities Committee will focus in particular on help for women aged 40 and over where the pay gap emerges. The ONS figures showed that women in full-time employment and aged between 22 and 29 were earning more than their male counterparts. It has been claimed that women who take time out to have children suffer the most later on - falling behind in the pay stakes when returning to the workplace. Minister for Women and Equalities Nicky Morgan said: ""We have been clear that you can't have true opportunity without equality and that's why eliminating the gender pay gap is a key priority for this government. ""These figures confirm the need for us to drive forward change."" But in her reaction to the figures, TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""Progress on closing the full-time gender pay gap has slowed dramatically over the last few years. ""If it continues to fall at this pace, we're looking at nearly half a century before we have pay parity between women and men. She added: ""While bringing in mandatory pay gap reporting is a welcome step, it must not be delayed. David Cameron should extend the law to medium-size companies as well as large employers, and companies that don't comply with the law should be fined. A Government-commissioned report recently called for more action on pay at the top, with bonuses at major firms to be linked to the number of women in senior positions. The statistics released on Wednesday by the ONS also showed that average weekly earnings - adjusted for inflation - rose for the first time since 2008 this year - by 1.9%. The ONS credited low inflation and a pick up in the pace of wage growth - a scenario which has boosted consumer spending power following years of inflation outstripping pay."

Sky Q is a range of set-top boxes, hubs and apps that combine satellite and internet TV viewing. The system is based on the notion of 'fluid viewing', so that customers can watch programmes across a number of screens - for example, pausing a show in one room, then watching it in another. Customers will also be able to download programmes to their tablet, to watch on the go. Interactive apps including YouTube and Vevo will also be available through the system. The new remote for Sky Q Sky's chief executive Jeremy Darroch said: ""We wanted to reimagine TV so that it's flexible and seamless across different screens."" The television industry has become increasingly competitive with US technology companies like Amazon, Apple, Google and Netflix all offering on-demand products through the internet. Asked whether a set-top box was old-fashioned in an age of online streaming services, Sky's director of new products, Andrew Olson, told Sky News: ""What we found is that the experience is something that you just can't create without really controlling all the pieces of hardware and software, so we've brought all of that together into this new experience."" Sky Q boxes will also double as Wi-Fi hotspots, connected through in-home electrical wiring, as well as Wi-Fi. David Mercer, from Strategy Analytics, commented: ""Sky customers watch 20% of programmes on connected devices and Sky Q is squarely targeted at the most demanding of this on-demand generation. ""And it needs to be; premium customers are the best bet for increasing revenue, as many people are looking to reduce TV bills. ""Sky Q, alongside Now TV's 'buffet' model, means Sky now covers consumers at opposite ends of this spectrum."" :: Sky Q will be available in the UK and Ireland in early 2016. Its pricing has not been confirmed."

Nearly one in 10 said they would hold back pay rises for the rest of the workforce. Those in the retail and hospitality sector will be hardest hit by the policy according to the study by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) and the Resolution Foundation. From April 2016, workers aged 25 and above will be paid a minimum hourly rate of £7.20. In the poll of more than 1,000 firms, 54% said the policy would have an effect on their wage bills. Research found that 30% would respond by improving efficiency or productivity though 26% said at the time of the survey in September that it was still too soon to say how they would manage the cost implications of the policy. The figures showed 9% were preparing to reduce basic pay growth for the rest of the workforce while 9% said they would cut hours and 8% will hire more workers under 25. The report found 8% would hire more apprentices and 7% would cancel or scale down plans for growing the business. Meanwhile, 22% said they would take lower profits or absorb costs while 16% signalled reduced overtime and bonuses and 15% said they would raise prices. Mark Beatson, chief economist at the CIPD, said: ""The national living wage was a bombshell for most employers when it was announced in July. It comes into force next April, which does not give employers a lot of time to prepare."" Conor D'Arcy, policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: ""It's encouraging that so many firms say that they'll respond to the new higher wage floor by improving efficiency. ""But actually delivering this will prove challenging in many sectors, and it's important that firms are given the necessary support to boost productivity."""

An apologetic no-show at your local church fete is one thing. Failing to turn up to a heads of government meeting when you need a big favour from them is something else entirely. David Cameron has made his excuses at the first meeting of EU leaders since he outlined his demands for reform ahead of the referendum on Britain's membership. Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, has called an informal meeting to discuss the migration crisis held directly after the Valletta summit in Malta. The British Prime Minister has already flown home. To be fair, Mr Cameron has a good excuse: he is hosting the Indian Prime Minister back in the UK. But if he is to get other leaders to agree to his demands for EU reform, he needs to butter up his allies at every opportunity. No 10 have said that Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte will represent the UK at the informal EU Council. Downing Street insists this is not unusual - and they point out that the Irish are being represented by the Danes and the Czechs will represent Poland. However, there is a difference. The Irish and the Czechs are not demanding an overhaul of the EU. To make matters worse, Mr Rutte has previously warned that a British exit from the EU would be a ""killer"" for the City of London and leave the UK as a ""mid-sized economy"" in the mid-Atlantic. Allies of Mr Cameron will point out that the informal meeting isn't about EU reform, but about the migration crisis. That may be true. However, Europe may be more amenable to accommodating awkward British demands if they are persuaded that the UK is playing a full part in an even bigger crisis hitting the continent."

Nadene Lomu, the wife and manager of the rugby great, said in a statement: ""It is with great sadness that I must announce my dear husband Jonah Lomu died (overnight). ""This is a devastating loss for our family and may I ask that our privacy, especially the privacy of our two very young boys, be respected as we take them through this traumatic time."" Lomu arrives in Auckland just hours before he died. Pic: Craig Norenbergs A family spokesman told TV3: ""I can confirm that Jonah Lomu died this morning ... it was totally unexpected. ""Jonah and his family arrived back from the UK last night."" Lomu had dealt with the severe kidney ailment nephrotic syndrome since 1995 which forced his premature retirement from international rugby in 2002. After having a kidney transplant in 2004 he tried unsuccessfully to resume his professional career in Wales and France. While his health seemed to improve he could not regain his former dominance and eventually retired from all rugby in 2006. Since Lomu's transplant failed in 2011, he became reliant on dialysis. He won 63 caps for the All Blacks during an impressive career which saw him regarded as rugby union's first global superstar. A tweet from New Zealand Rugby chief Steve Tew read: ""We're all shocked and deeply saddened at the sudden death of Jonah Lomu."" He added: ""We're lost for words and our heartfelt sympathies go out to Jonah's family. ""Jonah was a legend of our game and loved by his many fans both here and around the world."" New Zealand's prime minister said the nation would be ""devastated"" by the loss of Lomu.

David, who did not want to give his full name, was at the Comptoir Voltaire restaurant when there was an explosion just as a waitress brought food to his table. Mobile phone footage from the aftermath of the attack is believed to show David, 46, trying to help a man on the ground in a tangle of chairs and tables. David, who initially thought there had been a gas explosion, said: ""He was unconscious, he had nothing special, but I noticed that on the side of his body there was an enormous hole. A large hole on his side.  ""When I ripped his T-shirt - it was me who ripped it, this T-shirt - and I saw some wires. Gallery: Victims Of Paris Terror Attacks Friends of couple Marie Lausch and Mathias Dymarski staged a vigil in Metz on Saturday after learning their friends were among the dead. One friend tweeted: 'I have no words, only tears.' ""I looked up again at the lamps, these heating lamps, and I noticed that there was nothing wrong (with them). ""They are made of a material that becomes distorted quite easily. I saw there was nothing there, nothing wrong with the three of them. ""On the ground there was blood and I noticed the first bolts on the ground. Then I understood immediately. I told myself, 'it's an explosion (that made the wound in his side), it's a suicide bomber' and I knew it was him. ""And at that precise moment when I realised what he was, the emergency services arrived. ""I told to the fireman: 'This man has lots of wires on him,' he screamed, he said: 'Everyone get away, we evacuate everyone'. And then we all went outside."" David said he was told the following day that the man whose life he was trying to save was suicide bomber Brahim Abdeslam, one of the men behind the attacks that killed 130 people across Paris. He said: ""He told me I was very lucky as they said on TV that his bomb did not explode like it should have done. Otherwise he would have caused much more damage. ""It was Sunday afternoon that I realised that by putting him on the ground, by performing CPR - I performed some pretty rough actions - I could have got killed too. Completely. I think about it, I still think about it."" Before unknowingly attempting to help the suicide bomber, David had already aided a woman by getting her to a safe position and then a young man who was conscious but bleeding heavily. He told his story as the United Nations backed a French call for greater international action to tackle the IS terror threat. It has also emerged that the Paris attacks ringleader Abdelhamid Abaaoud was caught on CCTV dodging a fare on the Metro at 10pm - 35 minutes after gunfire and explosions erupted across the city. Security footage showed Abaaoud at Croix de Chavaux station in the east Paris suburb Montreuil, where a black Seat car used in an attack was found with AK-47 rifles inside. Seven people arrested during the siege that saw Abaaoud and two others killed at the apartment where he was holed up have now been released, prosecutors said. A man who admitted lending the apartment to two people as a ""favour"" and denied knowing any more is still being detained. Meanwhile, in Turkey, police have detained a man suspected of scouting out target sites for IS ahead of the Paris attacks. Ahmet Dahmani, 26, was held at a luxury hotel in the southern coastal city of Antalya, where world leaders had been meeting days earlier at the G20 summit, the Dogan news agency said. Gallery: In Pics: Raid That Killed Paris Attacks Ringleader A raid took place in the northern Paris suburb of Saint Denis on Wednesday as security forces looked for the suspected terror attacks ringleader Abdelhamid Abaaoud The report said two other men, both Syrians, were also detained nearby on suspicion that they had been sent by Islamic State to ensure Dahmani's safe passage across the border. Counter-terrorism police first became aware of Dahmani - a Belgian man of Moroccan origin - when he arrived on a flight to Antalya and tracked him to the hotel in the Manavgat district of the city, Dogan said. Separately, Turkey deported a group of Moroccans detained at Istanbul's main airport this week over suspected links to IS. Paris officials have said a ban on public gatherings over fears of another attack will now be extended until 30 November."

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said public sector net borrowing, excluding the effects of bank bailouts, rose last month by £1.1bn on the same month last year to £8.2bn. Economists had been predicting a figure of £6bn. It meant borrowing was at its highest October level since 2009 - pressuring the Chancellor's official borrowing target of £69.5bn for the financial year to April 2016. Borrowing between April and October stood at £54.3bn - 11% down on the same period in 2014/15. Nevertheless, economists expect the performance to result in the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) raising the borrowing target next Wednesday, when Mr Osborne outlines his spending priorities for the current Parliament. The adjustment could take the target above £80bn - if current OBR rolling forecasts are taken into account. Mr Osborne is relying on stronger tax receipts from an economy with record employment and rising wages to help keep borrowing in check. Headwinds include not only an easing of UK economic growth but also higher costs to service debt. The Treasury responded to the ONS figures by saying they showed that the job of fixing the public finances was not yet completed as it aims to run a budget surplus by 2019/20. The Spending Review and Autumn Statement will detail how Government departments aim to save £20bn over the next four years - with ministers facing pressure on tax credits in particular. Mr Osborne was forced to delay his programme of cuts - pending changes to improve support for the poorest - after the plans were defeated by the House of Lords. But he told Sky News he was determined to implement reforms as part of his aim to deliver a low-welfare, high-wage economy."

The Ministry of Defence said the fighter jets took off from RAF Lossiemouth on Thursday night. The Russian planes did not enter UK airspace but strayed near enough to the edge of international airspace to be in what is known as a ""British area of interest"". ""RAF Quick Reaction Alert Typhoon fighter aircraft were launched overnight from RAF Lossiemouth on a NATO air policing mission after unidentified aircraft were detected flying over the Atlantic in International Airspace,"" an RAF spokesperson said. ""The aircraft were identified as Russian Tu-160 Blackjack aircraft which were escorted by the RAF until they were clear of the UK area of interest.

It is the latest in a series of incidents involving Russian bombers near UK airspace. Sky News Defence Correspondent Alistair Bunkall has described such incidents as the Russians ""playing games"". ""They don't come into British airspace, they don't come into European airspace, but they come into what is called a British area of interest,"" he said. ""These are games, in effect. The Russians, strictly speaking, aren't doing anything illegal but it does annoy the Ministry of Defence."" Britain summoned Russia's ambassador in January after RAF Typhoons were scrambled when two Russian bombers flew over the English Channel. A Foreign Office spokesperson said the incident was part of an ""increasing pattern of out of area operations by Russian aircraft"". NATO last year said there had been an ""unusual"" increase in activity from Russian military jets over European airspace ranging from the Black Sea to the Atlantic Ocean."

The pilot and six passengers were on board the aircraft when it went down at Fox Glacier on the remote west coast of the South Island in what have been described as poor conditions. Four rescue helicopters were sent to the scene and a paramedic and alpine rescue team were winched down to the scene of the crash and confirmed there were no survivors. A spokesman for the New Zealand Police said it is thought all six passengers were foreign tourists, while the pilot was a local man. ""It is believed two were Australians,"" the spokesman said, adding that formal identification will take ""some time."" Gallery: Seven Killed In New Zealand Helicopter Crash The helicopter crashed on the Fox Glacier on New Zealand's South Island, a popular sightseeing spot. Four British people have been confirmed as among the dead ""Police have been liaising with the embassies of the countries concerned to ensure the next of kin are advised of the situation."" Britain's Foreign Office confirmed the deaths of the Britons and said it was helping their families. Images of the crash site show the helicopter buried between walls of ice in a deep crevasse some 2,500 feet (762-metres) up the glacier. Bits of debris are spread over several hundred metres. Police have said the remote location of the wreckage and poor weather conditions mean efforts to recover the victims can not take place until Sunday and could last several days. Speaking of the recovery operation, Police Inspector John Canning said: ""I'm not going to risk any more lives, we've lost seven."" According to Grey District Mayor Tony Kokshoorn, weather conditions were marginal at the time of the crash, with intermittent rain showers and low clouds. ""It was not ideal for helicopter flying,"" he told the AP news agency. TVNZ producer Suzanne Burgess told Sky News search and rescue operations were initially hampered by a considerable amount of low cloud. The helicopter is reported to belong to Alpine Adventures, which is one of many companies that run helicopter and private charter sight-seeing trips for tourists around the eight-mile-long glacier."

Parts of the UK saw a flurry of snow overnight and in the early hours of the morning, bringing a sharp end to what has so far been the second mildest November on record. Snow fell as far south as Eastbourne and East Sussex, with areas in Scotland, Wales, northern England and the Midlands also hit. According to North Yorkshire Police dangerous weather conditions have forced the closure of the the A169 between Whitby and Pickering. North Yorkshire and Cumbria police have issued warnings to drivers to take care on the road as the snow settles. Gallery: UK Sees Flurry Of Snow As Temperatures Plummet Snow fell across the UK on Friday night and early Saturday morning. Pic: Nenthead in Cumbria Forecasters said further snow showers were less likely as the day goes on. Sky News weather presenter Nazaneen Ghaffar said: ""Early wintry showers across central and eastern parts of England will clear, leaving most inland areas of the UK dry and sunny for this afternoon. ""However, a mix of rain, sleet and snow showers will continue to affect eastern and western coastal areas, as well as parts of Scotland and Ireland through today. ""It'll be a cold day for all areas, especially with the brisk northerly winds, gusting close to 50mph across parts of England and Wales."" :: This Weekend's Weather Forecast Weekend temperatures are set to be below average for this time of year, with southern parts struggling to reach 6C and parts of Scotland barely managing to rise above freezing. Snow is unexpected on Saturday night although frost will cover wide areas of the country into Sunday and Devon, Cornwall and the west of Wales could see gales reaching 65mph. Frank Saunders, the Met Office's chief operational meteorologist, said: ""The Met Office is forecasting strong winds and some snow for this weekend which means there is the likelihood of some difficult driving conditions and possible disruption to transport."" The cold spell will die away from Monday, with warmer weather and rain spreading east. Gritters will be on the roads, with highways bosses having stockpiled 1.2 million tonnes of salt - leaving half of the country's councils at the limit of their storage capacity. Councillor Peter Box, the Local Government Association's environment spokesman, said councils will monitor weather reports but he encouraged residents to look after each other - especially elderly neighbours."

The Belgian capital's underground transport system will be closed until Sunday afternoon, dozens of events have been cancelled and many public places closed. Heavily armed soldiers and police are patrolling the city amid fears at least one suspect in the Paris attacks could be in Belgium. Belgium's Prime Minister Charles Michel said the terror alert was as a result of ""quite precise information about the risk of an attack like the one that happened in Paris"". Mr Michel said the security situation would be reviewed on Sunday. It comes after a meeting of top ministers, police and security services in the city, which is also home to the headquarters of the European Union and NATO. A spokesman for the country's crisis centre said: ""Following our latest evaluation... the centre has raised its terror alert to level 4, signifying a very serious threat, for the Brussels region. ""The analysis shows a serious and imminent threat requiring specific security measures as well as detailed recommendations to the population."" Sky's Enda Brady, who is in Brussels, said he has been told three quarters of the shops in some areas have been closed. The rest of the country, outside Brussels and the Vilvoorde area, remains at level 3, meaning an attack is ""probable"". Belgium, and Brussels in particular, have been at the centre of investigations into the Paris attacks after it emerged that two of the suicide bombers had been living in the country. Three people detained in Brussels are facing terrorism charges. The brother of one of the suicide bombers, who was also living in Brussels, is still on the run. Salah Abdeslam was briefly pulled over by French police near the Belgian border last Saturday morning along with two of those in custody. The Belgian interior minister has reportedly said that he wants a headcount in the Molenbeek area of Brussels, where Abdeslam lived, as the authorities do not know exactly who lives there. Belgian news website Nieuwsblad reported Jan Jambon as saying: ""It's unacceptable that we don't know who is living on our territory. Right now, there are flats where two people are listed but 10 are actually living…the local authorities need to knock on every door and ask who really lives there."" Meanwhile, The Federal Prosecutors Office in Brussels denied reports in Belgian magazine Derniere Heure that chemicals and explosives were among an arsenal found during searches on Friday night. Officials confirmed that police had searched the house of a person who was arrested on Friday but had only found ""a few weapons""."

The bloody battle began on 1 July 1916 - and more died on the first day of the Somme than at any other point in World War One. More than a million people were lost or wounded by the time the battle ended on 18 November that year. To commemorate the centenary, overnight events will take place on 30 June around the Grave of the Unknown Warrior at Westminster Abbey, as well as at the Scottish National War Memorial in Edinburgh Castle. In Northern Ireland, a through-the-night vigil is being planned at the Clandeboye and Helen's Tower in Co Down, with another at the Welsh National War Memorial in Cardiff. On the day of 1 July, a national commemorative service will take place at Manchester Cathedral, and this will be followed by a possession through the city to Heaton Park. The events were announced by Culture Secretary John Whittingdale, who added: ""We must never forget the scale of what happened at the Somme. ""Almost every family in the country was touched by the devastating losses. ""I hope people of all generations up and down the country will have the chance to attend an event and honour the bravery of those who sacrificed so much."" The Government has already announced that a remembrance event will be held at Thiepval in northern France next July, which is home to a memorial for the 72,195 men who died in the Somme and have no known grave."

One worshipper told Sky News that in the days after the attacks white work colleagues had suggested that he was a terrorist. Tariq Choudhary, a manager at a Leeds food company, said the remarks were meant as a joke but had left him feeling hurt and uncomfortable. Reacting to increased tensions between communities, imams across the country recited a ""Prayer for the nation"" which included the words: ""Give us the strength to protect and care for our neighbours."" As mosque congregations shared their experiences, the NSPCC reported it had received more than 100 calls to ChildLine in the past week from Muslim children fearful of being attacked.

Deputy Chief Constable Iain Livingstone from Police Scotland said 40 of the crimes had been solved and predicted more arrests would be made. ""People of all faiths, and of none, should live in a Scotland free from hate crime and discrimination,"" he said. Meanwhile, at the Makkah mosque in Leeds, Imam Qari Asim called on his congregation to reject the message of extremists. ""We must remain united against those who wish to divide us, and we can only do so if we all come together and we recognise that those terrorists who want to create division between communities don't represent Islam,"" he said."
2015-11-21,Ministers have been urged by MPs to introduce a scrappage scheme for diesel cars to help bring down dangerously high air pollution levels blamed for tens of thousands of deaths each year.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151121164822/http://news.sky.com/story/1591324/mps-call-for-diesel-car-scrappage-scheme,"Ministers have been urged by MPs to introduce a scrappage scheme for diesel cars to help bring down dangerously high air pollution levels blamed for tens of thousands of deaths each year. The scheme, proposed by the Commons Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) ahead of George Osborne's Autumn Statement next week, would provide incentives for motorists to get rid of their diesel vehicles in exchange for cleaner alternatives. It revives memories of a £400m scrappage scheme that ran from 2009 to 2010 and saw owners who scrapped their old cars paid £2,000 - split between Government and the motor industry - towards the cost of a new one, boosting the fortunes of the car making industry. The MPs' proposal to apply such a scheme nationwide to diesel cars echoes calls by London mayor Boris Johnson and the RAC last year. It comes in the wake of Volkswagen’s admission earlier this year that it had cheated on emissions tests for its diesel vehicles. That prompted fears that VW owners had seen hundreds of pounds each knocked off the value of their cars. The EAC also called for car tax to be altered to take into account emissions of nitrogen dioxide - the pollutant at the centre of the VW scandal - as well as carbon. Committee chairman Huw Irranca-Davies said: ""Tens of thousands of premature deaths are being caused in the UK every year by illegal levels of air pollution on our roads. ""Despite mounting evidence of the damage diesel fumes do to human health, changes to vehicle excise duty announced in this year’s Budget maintains the focus only on CO2 emissions."" He said this was a missed opportunity and the Chancellor had the chance to ""strike a better balance"" next week. ""The Treasury must use vehicle excise duty to create long-term incentives for drivers to buy cleaner hybrid and electric cars that minimise both CO2 and harmful pollutants. ""Introducing a national diesel scrappage scheme could also provide a short-cut to cleaning up the air in our cities,"" said Mr Irranca-Davies. The report comes as VW confirms plans to slash its investment spending by €1bn (£700m) for next year as it braces itself for a multi-billion euro hit from the emissions scandal."
2015-11-21,"Petrol prices are forecast to fall further over the coming weeks, with the RAC seeing a ""good chance"" that supermarket pump costs will reach £1 per litre.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151121164822/http://news.sky.com/story/1591204/fuel-prices-good-chance-of-1-a-litre,"Petrol prices are forecast to fall further over the coming weeks, with the RAC seeing a ""good chance"" that supermarket pump costs will reach £1 per litre. The motoring organisation said it expected reductions of 2p a litre in both petrol and diesel costs over the next fortnight - reflecting continued weakness in oil costs which are still hovering near six-year lows. A barrel of Brent crude is currently costing just over $44 - reflecting high stockpiles and production amid weak demand because of the economic slowdown in China and many emerging markets. The glut is explained by several factors, including a refusal to slash output within the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) cartel as it battles to keep market share with US shale oil flooding the market. Russian production is at record levels as it attempts to maximise revenues from losses to income through economic sanctions imposed by the West for its actions in Ukraine. A warm autumn in both the US and Europe has also been credited with pegging oil costs down - with a recent note by Goldman Sachs indicating that prices could halve if warmer weather persists in the current market climate. The RAC said the average price of petrol, which has fallen for the last four months, was currently at 108p - with diesel just over 110p. A postcode lottery remained, though, with supermarkets generally offering the cheapest fuel. The RAC called for retailers to pass on savings in the wholesale cost. Just last week, the AA told Sky News that pump prices were failing to keep pace with declines in oil costs because refineries had been protecting their margins. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: ""After a summer of lower forecourt prices, motorists are now looking forward to the prospect of yet lower petrol and diesel in the run-up to the expensive festive period. ""While we are a way off average petrol prices reaching £1 a litre, there is a good chance the most price-competitive fuel retailers will take the plunge. The last time petrol costs widely hit £1 a litre was in 2009, the RAC said. Mr Williams added: ""Low oil and fuel prices appear to be here to stay as cutting supply to shore up prices is not an option for OPEC as it is dead set on not letting its competitors take any of its share. ""With yet more oil due to hit the market as Iran begins to produce again following its nuclear deal with the West, the long-term outlook has to be low oil prices for a further 12 months."""

It follows the unanimous UN backing of France's call to redouble action against the extremist group in the wake of the Paris terror attacks. The world powers also agreed to co-ordinate efforts aimed at preventing further atrocities by IS - but the resolution does not provide any legal basis for military action. David Cameron says the world has united against Islamic State The UN Security Council said IS ""constitutes a global and unprecedented threat to international peace and security"" and it expressed the determination ""to combat by all means this unprecedented threat"". Before the Prime Minister's meeting on counter-terrorism efforts with Francois Hollande was confirmed, Mr Cameron said the decision by the UN was an ""important moment"". :: Metro Stations Closed In Brussels As Terror Alert Raised ""Britain will continue to support our allies who are fighting ISIL in Syria,"" he added. ""I will continue to make the case for us to do more and to build support in Parliament for the action that I believe is necessary for Britain to take to protect our own security, as part of a determined international strategy. ""We cannot expect others to shoulder the burdens and the risks of protecting this country."" The UN vote comes a week after militants launched co-ordinated gun and bomb attacks in the French capital, killing 130 people. The continuing global threat posed by extremists was again highlighted after gunmen stormed a luxury hotel in Mali, where at least 21 people have been killed. The resolution was drafted by the French, co-sponsored by the UK and also gained support from the Russians, whose veto power previously led Western nations to put off seeking UN backing. Although the UN resolution does not invoke the chapter of the UN charter authorising the use of force, Mr Cameron - who insists there is a legal case for military action even without it - will hope it will bolster support at Westminster for his efforts to extend airstrikes into Syria. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is strongly opposed to such a move and spoke out earlier against the prospect of ""external intervention"". Seven days after the massacre in France, Parisians took to the city's streets in a united show of defiance. Crowds gathered at the scenes of the attacks and landmarks to hold vigils and mark the exact moment a week on when the terrorists launched their deadly rampage. Bouquets were laid at the Place de la Republique, lit by the flames of hundreds of candles, and at the cafe La Belle Equipe, where one of the gun attacks took place, mourners broke into a round of applause at a memorial for the victims. France will be on a state of high alert until well into the new year after the country's senate voted to extend a state of emergency for three months. The move expands powers to allow police to carry out arrests and searches, while authorities can ban the movement of people and vehicles at specific times and places. Meanwhile, Belgian authorities have brought terror charges against a third suspect over the attacks, with two others in custody. In Brussels, Metro stations have been closed and troops have joined heavily armed police on the streets as the terror alert was raised."

An apologetic no-show at your local church fete is one thing. Failing to turn up to a heads of government meeting when you need a big favour from them is something else entirely. David Cameron has made his excuses at the first meeting of EU leaders since he outlined his demands for reform ahead of the referendum on Britain's membership. Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, has called an informal meeting to discuss the migration crisis held directly after the Valletta summit in Malta. The British Prime Minister has already flown home. To be fair, Mr Cameron has a good excuse: he is hosting the Indian Prime Minister back in the UK. But if he is to get other leaders to agree to his demands for EU reform, he needs to butter up his allies at every opportunity. No 10 have said that Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte will represent the UK at the informal EU Council. Downing Street insists this is not unusual - and they point out that the Irish are being represented by the Danes and the Czechs will represent Poland. However, there is a difference. The Irish and the Czechs are not demanding an overhaul of the EU. To make matters worse, Mr Rutte has previously warned that a British exit from the EU would be a ""killer"" for the City of London and leave the UK as a ""mid-sized economy"" in the mid-Atlantic. Allies of Mr Cameron will point out that the informal meeting isn't about EU reform, but about the migration crisis. That may be true. However, Europe may be more amenable to accommodating awkward British demands if they are persuaded that the UK is playing a full part in an even bigger crisis hitting the continent."

Thomas Butcher was among four people killed fleeing the inferno which has been described as ""an atom bomb going off"". The 31-year-old mechanic, from Sheffield, who moved to Australia four years ago, got a job on the farm in Esperance last November and became attached to a horse called Cougar. Linda Campbell, who runs the farm with her husband David, told The West Australian newspaper: ""He was fighting the fires with my husband when Dave made the call that our house was in direct danger and he had to get back. ""He (the mechanic) then made the decision that he would take the horse and go."" She also recalled seeing the fire come towards the farm: ""We knew it was coming. ""Imagine an atom bomb going off a kilometre down the road - that's what it looks like."" A wildfire burns near the town of Esperance Mr Butcher’s partner paid tribute to her ""soulmate"" on Facebook. ""Although I am feeling lost I have so many memories that we shared together,"" she wrote. ""The love and the laughter. I will remember and cherish our last kiss and touch. ""My love for you will stay strong for my life. Have fun with Coug in heaven and I will take care of our Bubba girl. ""I've told her the news and it was felt heavily. We will go for a ride for you and Cougs."" Two women who also worked on the farm - and a neighbour farmer who was driving around trying to warn people about the inferno - were also killed in Tuesday’s blaze. More than 200 firefighters have been working to combat the spread of the wildfires in the area. Department of Fire and Emergency Services Commissioner Wayne Gregson described the conditions as ""catastrophic and unstoppable""."

Officers found the 22-year-old victim in a property in the Bronx, New York City, with multiple stab wounds to her torso. Another woman, who lived at the home, was clutching the newborn baby girl. She told police she had given birth to the child during the struggle, according to councilman Andy King. The baby is being cared for at a hospital ""It appeared that the foetus of the 22-year-old woman was surgically removed by the alleged perpetrator, who is in custody right now,"" Mr King said. Police found blood splattered on the property's staircase, in a second floor bathroom and on the door of a bedroom where the victim was found. A knife was discovered on the floor, while a placenta was found in the hallway near the bathroom, the city official said. The attacker is in police custody Emergency workers tended to the newborn to make sure she could breathe until an ambulance arrived, Mr King said. The baby was unhurt and is being cared for at a hospital in the Bronx. She has reportedly been named as Genesis. The woman who claimed the child as hers is in police custody and charges are pending. She is also 22 years old. Police were called to the home by the suspect's boyfriend, who reportedly walked in on the aftermath of the stabbing. Local media named the victim as Angelikque Sutton and reported she had been due to give birth early next month. It is not clear if Ms Sutton knew her alleged killer or why she was paying a visit to her home. Ms Sutton had listed online baby registries of items she needed, including a cot and diaper bag, according to the New York Daily News. Police said further details would be released after a post-mortem examination and blood tests to establish the identities of the baby's parents."

In 2010, his wife Iris, who was an MP herself, had an affair with a 19-year-old and lobbied for investment in her young lover’s business. Days earlier, police had confirmed they were investigating Mrs Robinson, then 59, for describing homosexuality as an ""abomination"" and claiming gay people could be ""cured"". Iris Robinson Her husband, the father of their three children, stood down for six weeks to refute allegations he had failed to report his wife’s business activities. Speaking at the time, he said: ""I continue to contend that I’ve acted ethically and properly and it’s particularly painful at a time of great personal trauma and turmoil that I have to defend myself from an unfounded and mischievous allegation."" :: Peter Robinson To Step Down As NI First Minister A former estate agent, Mr Robinson made the switch to politics when the IRA murdered his old school friend, Harry Beggs, in 1971. Inspired by the firebrand speeches of the Rev Ian Paisley, he joined the campaign to ""keep Ulster British"" and helped found the Democratic Unionist Party. He condemned paramilitary violence but was arrested for leading a loyalist invasion of Clontibret in the Irish Republic in protest at the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement. In recent years, some thought he was too moderate but he stood down again when Stormont was not suspended over claims the IRA still existed. Speaking at the time, he said: ""The assessment of the Chief Constable of the involvement of the IRA in the murder, the continued existence of IRA structures, and the arrests that followed has pushed devolution to the brink."" The Democratic Unionist Party lost the battle over the 1998 Good Friday Agreement but won the political war, eventually displacing the rival Ulster Unionist Party. With a reputation for ice-cool negotiation, Mr Robinson played a key role in the 2006 St Andrews Agreement, the framework for Northern Ireland’s power-sharing government. Sam McBride, the Ulster Newsletter’s political correspondent, said: ""David Trimble is remembered as the person who did the (1998) deal.  ""Ian Paisley is remembered as the person who managed to ultimately share power with Sinn Fein after a lifetime of saying no.  ""Peter Robinson, it’s much more difficult to pin down his political ideology and therefore, for a lot of people, the scandal which surrounded his wife and the extraordinary events which emerged at that point in a party which is, in many ways, very puritanical about these issues, will really be how they remember Peter Robinson."" Peter and Iris Robinson became the first couple of Northern Ireland politics when he succeeded Rev Paisley as party leader and First Minister in 2007. With three lavish homes, tabloids branded them ""the swish family Robinson"" and their final days in power were dominated by questions about their business dealings."

In an exclusive interview with Sky News, Daniel Watts, 20, said Nathan Matthews would always pose a risk to teenagers. Matthews, 28, will serve a minimum of 33 years in prison after being given a life sentence for the murder of 16-year-old Becky. His girlfriend, Shauna Hoare, 21, has been jailed for 17 years for manslaughter. Daniel Watts said Matthews will always be dangerous. Dan Watts told Sky News He wanted to see Nathan Matthews dead ""It wouldn't be safe for teenagers or anyone. He'll be 61 when he gets out and he'll still be looking for teenagers 'cos he's gone in the head,"" he said. Becky Watts was suffocated in her home on 19 February after a sexually motivated kidnap plot by Hoare and Matthews failed. The 16-year-old's body was then dismembered and the remains hidden in a shed. The day Becky died was Daniel Watts' 20th birthday, a day he will never celebrate again, he said. ""People say you can't let it like get you down but obviously that's the day my sister was taken."" Daniel and Becky lived with Matthews for many years, viewing him as an older brother. But Daniel said he can never forgive Matthews. ""He's just a complete animal,"" he said. ""But obviously he never showed that side to me when I was younger. The betrayal from him is unbelievable."" Paying tribute to his ""perfect"" sister, Mr Watts thanked the public for all of their support and said that he was now backing a campaign to put a memorial lamp in the park near her home in St George, Bristol to help keep other teenagers safe at night."

The puppy - named Dobrynya - is intended to replace French police dog Diesel, who was killed during an anti-terrorism raid in Paris in the days after the attacks. There were 130 people killed and hundreds more injured in the attacks on various venues in Paris on 13 November. In a letter posted on the ministry's Facebook page, the Russian minister for internal affairs Vladimir Kolokoltsez wrote to his French counterpart Bernard Cazeneuve, offering the young canine as ""confirmation of our solidarity with the French police in these troubled days"". Dobrynya was the maternal uncle and tutor of Russian leader Vladimir the Great and was later a hero and knight in Russian folklore, known as ""the personification of strength, kindness, bravery and selflessness"".

2015-11-21,"British airstrikes on Islamic State in Syria would not increase the threat of a terrorist attack in the UK, according to the Foreign Secretary.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151121164822/http://news.sky.com/story/1590794/syria-airstrikes-wont-increase-threat-to-uk,"By Jason Farrell, Senior Political Correspondent British airstrikes on Islamic State in Syria would not increase the threat of a terrorist attack in the UK, according to the Foreign Secretary. In an exclusive interview with Sky News, Philip Hammond said: ""We can't hide"" from IS, ""we have to deal with them."" Mr Hammond was on a diplomatic trip to Cyprus to help unify the island, which is a key NATO ally and home to strategic military bases for the UK. Asked if airstrikes would make the UK more of a target for IS, he said: ""No. I think the reality is that we are all vulnerable to attacks by ISIL. ""They have shown over the last couple of weeks in Sharm el Sheikh and in Paris that they have the capabilities, we know that they have the intent to do us harm. ""We can't hide from these people; we can't turn our backs and hope they don't see us. We have to confront them, we have to deal with them and defeat them."" Prime Minister David Cameron and his Foreign Secretary hope to convince Parliament that extending the UK mission into Syria will have a significant impact and is part of a coherent plan to ultimately bring stability to the region. Mr Cameron is expected to set out the case in a letter to the Foreign Affairs Committee next week. In the wake of the attacks on Paris, Mr Hammond believes it would be a mistake to take a pacifist approach. He said: ""We know that they have intent to attack us and we can't imagine for one moment that if we try to avoid irritating them somehow we will be safe. ""They are a threat to us and they are a threat to the entire civilised world."" Cyprus is of diplomatic and strategic importance in the conflict against IS and more so if RAF bombing missions from British bases on the island are extended from Iraq into Syria. But the island has its own conflicts, with 3% of it given over to a UN buffer zone dividing Greeks in the south from Turks in the north. The Foreign Secretary said he is ""positive"" about negotiations between the two sides that could lead to a referendum next year over the country's reunification. His trip is part of a wider international effort which will also see diplomatic visits from Russia, China and the United States. But disputes over property and politics stemming back to the conflict in 1974 still polarise Greek and Turkish Cypriots. While the Syrian conflict remains unresolved, Cyprus will also continue to be a destination for Syrian migrants.  Some asylum seekers have landed on British bases, but Mr Hammond insists that the sovereign areas are not an entry route to the UK. He said: ""I am expecting many of those migrants to be transferred to the Republic of Cyprus' control over the next few days."" ""I should be absolutely clear that the sovereign base areas are not a back door into the UK.""

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.5% in the third quarter, down from 0.7% in the previous period. Its latest, more detailed, estimate, showed trade posed the biggest drag on quarterly growth on record, lopping 1.5 percentage points off growth - as imports saw their biggest growth in ten years. The UK's slowdown comes as British exporters struggle amid global turmoil, with China's economic surge losing steam. Domestic growth remains strong, with consumer spending up 0.8% in the third quarter - its ninth rise in a row. But while the services sector, which dominates the economy, continued to power ahead, the beleaguered manufacturing and construction industries fell back. Scott Bowman, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""The second estimate of Q3 GDP showed that growth in the UK continues to be unbalanced. ""While we think that the slowdown in growth in Q3 will be temporary - indeed business surveys have bounced back in October - any acceleration will probably continue to be led by domestic demand and the service sector."" Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight: ""Confirmation of reduced GDP growth of 0.5% quarter-on-quarter reinforces our belief that the Bank of England is unlikely to raise interest rates before the second quarter of 2016."""
2015-11-27,Paula Radcliffe found herself under suspicion following publication of an analysis of a database of thousands of blood samples taken over an 11-year period.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151127193103/http://news.sky.com/story/1595647/how-iaaf-cleared-paula-radcliffe-of-doping,"Paula Radcliffe found herself under suspicion following publication of an analysis of a database of thousands of blood samples taken over an 11-year period. Blood tests are a crucial tool in the battle to catch sophisticated cheats, who use drugs or transfusions to boost their red blood cell count and thus gain an advantage in endurance sports. But it is a complex field in which identifying guilty rests on an analysis of blood readings taken over a lengthy period, rather than a positive or negative drugs test. Blood samples are taken over time to establish a blood profile for individual athletes as part of a ""biological passport"". Using these baseline readings, unusual results that might indicate doping can be identified. The IAAF has been taking blood samples for over a decade, but the system for taking, testing and analysing samples was only standardised in 2009. One of the IAAFs key criticisms is that firm conclusions cannot be drawn from blood tests taken before 2009, when the biological passport system was  standardised by the World Anti-Doping Agency. They say testing procedures before that date were not reliable.  The database includes 14 blood samples given by Radcliffe, three of which were reported to show values outside ""normal"" parameters under current rules, and therefore ""suspicious"". Radcliffe's ""off-scores"", the measure used to gauge an athlete's blood values, in the three tests were 114.86, 109.86 and 109.3. Anything above 103 recorded by a female athlete can be a trigger for investigation. In September, Radcliffe told Sky News that all three results could be explained by factors that are acknowledged to have an effect on blood samples. These include taking samples within two hours of strenuous exercise - a practice now banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency - and recent altitude training, both of which can contribute to misleading results and ""false positives"". Gallery: Career Highlights: Paula Radcliffe Over almost two decades, Paula Radcliffe has built a sporting legacy unparalleled in British women's athletics. Here she is at the 38th Berlin Marathon in 2011 - which she came third in The IAAF backs Radcliffe, stressing that on each occasion she was target-tested for EPO and returned negative urine samples. The first test was taken in Portugal in October 2004 immediately after she won the world half-marathon championship in 29C heat. The IAAF says that neither of the two blood values that contribute to the off-score was outside the thresholds then used. The second, with an off-score of 109.87, was taken in August 2005 within two hours of Radcliffe running in the World Championship 10,000m in Helsinki. Urine tests for EPO taken that day, and eight days later when she won the marathon, were negative, as were re-tests conducted seven years later. The final test, 109.35, was taken in Monte Carlo on 7 February, 2012. The IAAF says Radcliffe had been altitude training at 2,400m in Kenya from January 3 to 29, and had used an oxygen tent on her return. The result was examined by a panel of experts who concluded ""altitude was a plausible explanation for the values reported… and there was no basis to pursue the case""."

The search engine has released a list of the 10 most popular searches and trends over the last 12 months as part of its Year in Review. The Duchess of Cambridge was the second most popular search term, followed by EastEnders. Next on the list was former Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson - who was in the headlines after allegedly attacking a producer on the show. Celebrity Big Brother, Wimbledon, and Good Morning Britain presenter Susanna Reid also made the list. The late singer Cilla Black - who died at her home in Spain on 1 August - was in eighth spot. Caitlyn Jenner, who in April announced she identified as a trans-woman, is in ninth place. Her Vanity Fair cover made global headlines and raised the discussion of gender identity to international levels. Searches for Coronation Street completed the list. Yahoo UK editor Nick Petche said: ""Despite England not making it out of the group stages, the UK has been gripped with Rugby World Cup fever this year, as it was the most-searched item on Yahoo in 2015. ""Among the billions of online searches this year, the Duchess of Cambridge continued to win our hearts as she gave birth to a second royal baby, becoming the most-searched-for celebrity, as well as the second-most-searched term overall."" EastEnders' high placing appears to be driven by the ""who killed Lucy Beale?"" storyline which concluded this year. The storyline was also the most-asked question on Yahoo, ahead of ""What is Charlie Hebdo?"" and ""what is the minimum wage?""."

Children as young as five are said to have been racially abused and one estimate suggests a tenfold increase in hate crimes. Community leaders have called for Government intervention amid claims that some of the crimes were going unpunished. Others say local shoppers are travelling out of the town due to the number of far-right protest marches. An advocate for abused children, Chrissy Meleady, said she had seen far right extremists chasing a family and screaming ""Muslim paedophile"" at a seven-year-old boy. She said: ""We've had children having their jaws and arms broken. We've had women walking home from shopping with their children running, trying to escape far right demonstrations with gangs of men chasing and roaring at them that they were going to harm them."" The number of attacks is said to have risen significantly since a report in 2014 found that 1,400 white children in Rotherham had been subjected to sexual abuse by predominantly Pakistani-heritage men. Some community leaders say the recent terrorist attacks in Paris have inflamed an already toxic atmosphere in the town. One taxi driver, Ashraf Ali, told Sky News he had been repeatedly attacked by people purely because he was a Muslim. ""One put their hands through the hole in the screen between the back of the taxi and me and tried to choke me. ""I had to lean forward so they couldn't hit me. They tried to punch me and smash the perspex screen."" Some taxi drivers in the town have accused the extreme group Britain First of trying to ""wind them up"" by implying that innocent Muslims are involved in child grooming. The group's deputy leader Jayda Fransen denied trying to inflame the situation in Rotherham.

Rotherham's Labour  MP Sarah Champion condemned the remarks, saying: ""I find that an extraordinary comment and at best naive."" She added: ""Where do you draw the line?  First it's Islam and then what other faith is not good enough or what other way of living isn't good enough? It really disturbs me that people are saying that in public forums."""

Marie Lausch and Mathias Dymarski were confirmed killed by friends, who staged a vigil in the French city of Metz in memory of the couple the day after their deaths. Another of those who died at the Bataclan was Matthieu Giroud, a French citizen who was said to have ""limitless kindness"". Eyewitnesses said Nicolas Catinat, another killed at the concert hall, acted as a ""human shield"" to protect his friends. Matthieu de Rorthais​, 32, was a cancer survivor who was passionate about music. In a tribute on Facebook, relatives described him as ""kind, gentle and sensitive"". Paris' Sorbonne university named three students as being among the victims: Kheireddine Sahbi, Marion Lieffrig-Petard and Suzon Garrigues. London School of Economics graduate Valentin Ribet was described as a ""talented lawyer, extremely well liked, and a wonderful personality in the office"".

Mr Valle had lived in Paris for eight years with his French wife. Among others who lost their lives were Djamila Houd, 41, of Paris, who was reportedly killed in a cafe, and Alberto Gonzalez Garrido, 29, of Madrid, who died at the Bataclan. Writer Guillame Decherf, 43, and Mathieu Hoche, 38, a technician at the news channel France 24, also died at the Bataclan. Decherf was a writer who covered rock music for the French culture magazine Les Inrocks. The family of Aurelie de Peretti, 33, described her as someone who ""loved life and loved music"". She had been looking forward to the Bataclan concert for months, as it was her reward after working at a restaurant in Saint Tropez for six months. Georges Salines tweeted a number of appeals for help in finding his daughter Lola Salines, but he later confirmed she was among the victims. Friends had also been searching for Maud Serrault, a marketing director at Best Western. They later said she was among the victims at the Bataclan. Quentin Boulanger, who had worked for the cosmetics brand L'Oreal, had also not responded to messages sent by worried friends and family after he attended the Eagles of Death Metal concert. The 29-year-old's death was later confirmed.

2015-11-27,Some parts of the UK are set to see snow and strong winds this weekend.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151127193103/http://news.sky.com/story/1595036/uk-set-for-snow-and-storms-this-weekend,"By Jo Robinson, Weather Producer Some parts of the UK are set to see snow and strong winds this weekend. After a mild week, the weather is due to change on Friday with the arrival of a powerful jet stream delivering low pressure systems.  Heavy rain and gusty winds will move southeast, with blustery showers following. It will turn colder as the more persistent rain clears, bringing snow to hills in Scotland and Northern Ireland.  Friday night may also see snow settling in low levels of northern Scotland for a time. Gallery: UK Sees Flurry Of Snow As Temperatures Plummet Snow fell across the UK on Friday night and early Saturday morning. Pic: Nenthead in Cumbria The weekend will be colder overall and will stay unsettled, with further rain and gales expected, but southern parts will be milder and drier on Sunday. There will be more snow on northern hills too.  Flooding will become an increasing risk in the northwest, especially for western Scotland. On Sunday night, a nasty storm may pass to the north of the UK, bringing the risk of very strong winds to Scotland and Northern Ireland. Looking ahead to the start of the meteorological winter, computer models are suggesting December will be mild and unsettled, even stormy at times. That's not to say we won't have some cold spells, but it looks like any significant cold and snowy weather will be in the new year - if at all. Looking back, it's hard to believe the UK and Ireland have only seen one brief cold snap this autumn. After a relatively cool September, there were headlines of a cold and snowy winter ahead, but there was no real evidence for that. October turned out mild overall, and November is likely to be even milder. Provisional figures for the first 15 days of November show maximum temperatures a warm 3.8C above the UK average. That makes it the second warmest start to November since records began in 1772. Despite the mild conditions, it has been quite stormy at times, with Abigail and Barney around the middle of the month. Then last weekend saw our first proper cold spell as northerly winds dragged in air from the Arctic, giving our first widespread night frost. That's quite late in the season. There was also some snow, even to low levels briefly, but nothing unusual for this time of year."
2015-11-27,The London ambulance service is to become the first 999 trust to be placed into special measures.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20151127193103/http://news.sky.com/story/1595249/bullying-culture-at-uks-biggest-ambulance-trust,"The London ambulance service is to become the first 999 trust to be placed into special measures. Inspectors rated it as inadequate, blaming a culture of bullying and problems with poor emergency response times. England's Chief Inspector of Hospitals, Professor Sir Mike Richards, said putting the trust in special measures was a necessary step for improvement.   ""The trust has been performing poorly on response times since March 2014. ""This is a very serious problem, which the trust clearly isn't able to address alone, and which needs action to put right."" He praised the frontline staff as dedicated, hardworking and compassionate but said they were not being properly supported to do their jobs. ""Some reported a culture of harassment and bullying and we found that in many cases there just weren't enough properly trained staff, or that the proper equipment wasn't available to them."" Inspectors found dirty equipment, a lack of staff training and poor leadership. Some black and minority ethnic staff told the inspectors that at times they felt ""humiliated"" and ""ignored"" by managers. Some claimed they were overlooked for promotion. The response time for the most urgent calls - Category A to be responded to within eight minutes - is the worst in the country. The trust has not hit the target once since May 2014.  Sir Mike said: ""While we do have significant concerns about the performance of the ambulance service, I want to provide Londoners with some reassurance. ""Urgent steps are being taken - and improvements have already been made - to ensure that everyone who relies on this service receives excellent, timely care and that London has the ambulance service it deserves."" LAS chief executive Dr Fionna Moore said: ""While we are pleased that our caring and compassionate staff have been recognised in this report, we are sorry we have fallen short of some of the standards CQC and Londoners expect of us. ""As the newly appointed chief executive, I am, along with my leadership team, completely focused on addressing the challenges highlighted in this report. ""We accept that we need to improve the way we measure and monitor some important standards and processes but we would like to reassure Londoners that we always prioritise our response to our most critically ill and injured patients and, in the event of a major incident, we are ready to respond and CQC recognise this."" UNISON general secretary, Dave Prentis, said: ""This is a shocking indictment of the lack of funding that has gone to the ambulance service over the last five years. This is a particular problem in London where demand has soared in recent years."" The trust says it has now taken action to address the failings."

A number of shots hit the passenger side of a parked police car in the West Belfast suburb of Andersontown just before 7pm on Thursday evening. Two officers were in the car when it came under attack. They escaped unhurt but were badly shaken. Chief Superintendent Nigel Grimshaw from the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said: ""This was a mindless and reckless attempt to kill police officers who were carrying out routine duties as part of an investigation into serious crime. ""Thankfully it failed."" Mr Grimshaw said a review of procedures would be carried out in the wake of the attack but officers would not be put off carrying out their daily duties. Sinn Fein MLA Alex Maskey said: ""This attack happened in the early evening in a busy area and could have killed or seriously injured anyone in the area at the time. ""Those responsible have nothing to offer the community, they do not speak for local people and need to end these reckless and futile actions immediately. ""We will not allow them to drag us back to the past."" Anyone with information is asked to contact the PSNI on 101."

In a reference to the turmoil in the Labour Party, with several shadow cabinet members in open revolt against Jeremy Corbyn's opposition to airstrikes, he urged MPs to ""vote on the arguments"". :: Corbyn Facing Revolt Over Syria Airstrikes Speaking in Malta at the start of a three-day summit of Commonwealth leaders, Mr Cameron said: ""I believe there is a compelling case to take the effective action to keep our country safe. ""I thought many members of parliament on all sides of the House of Commons yesterday (Thursday) agreed there was a compelling case, so I would urge all of them to vote on the basis of the arguments for effective action on a compelling case to keep our country safe."" And the Prime Minister added: ""Vote on those arguments and we can do the right thing."" Mr Cameron said he had come to the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting to put extremism on the agenda. ""The Commonwealth is this extraordinary organisation, a third of humanity, countries stretching the globe, half of it under the age of 25,"" he said. ""So, I think one of the most important things we can do here is talk about the perils of Islamist extremism violence and the problem of extremism more broadly. ""I want to put that on the agenda of the Commonwealth, particularly when you consider how many young people there are in the Commonwealth. ""This is the struggle of our generation and it’s a struggle the Commonwealth should be engaged in."" Mr Cameron also welcomed the attendance in Malta  of French President Francois Hollande, who travelled to Malta to appeal to the 53 Commonwealth leaders to back a deal at the climate change summit in Paris next week. ""It's good that President Hollande is here at the Commonwealth meeting because there is a chance in the run up to the vital Paris conference on climate change to build the momentum for a global deal,"" said the Prime Minister. ""One of the advantages of the Commonwealth is we have got all of those small island states that are so vulnerable to climate change and if we can bring them on board for a deal that will help them we can then bring the whole world together in Paris and achieve a good climate change deal."" The PM's appeal to MPs to back airstrikes came after he pledged £5m over five years for a new Commonwealth unit to counter extremism. A team of experts will be seconded into a new unit in the Commonwealth Secretariat. ""The fight against extremism is something that affects us all,"" Mr Cameron said. ""The Commonwealth has a vital role to play in broadening international efforts to counter extremism. ""Its civil society and education networks make it particularly well placed to complement international efforts to build counter narratives to this poisonous extremist ideology. ""This is the struggle of our generation, but by working together we will defeat this extremist scourge that is a threat to us all."" The new unit will support work in all Commonwealth countries, in particular those facing a disproportionately high number of foreign fighters and which might not have adequate counter-extremism resources of their own, including by facilitating technical counter-terrorism expertise. In conjunction with this new counter-extremism unit, Mr Cameron is also promising £200,000 funding to expand the recently established European counter-radicalisation Youth Network to include all Commonwealth countries. The newly expanded Youth Network will capitalise on the organisation's existing networks to support moderate youth voices in countering violent extremist messaging."

Officers in Sydney went to the address after numerous calls were made claiming a woman could be heard screaming hysterically and a man yelling ""I'm going to kill you, you're dead. Die! Die!"" After police attended the address in the northern suburb of Wollstonecraft and started banging on the door, a man who was out of breath and flushed in the face answered. In a post on the force's Facebook page, New South Wales police said officers then questioned the man about who was in the apartment with him. When he replied that he did not have a wife or girlfriend, police were perplexed. Below is their transcript of the conversation that followed: Police: We had a report of a domestic and a women screaming, where is she? Male: I don't know what you're talking about, I live alone. Police: Come on mate, people clearly heard you yelling you were going to kill her and furniture getting thrown around the unit. Police: Come on mate, what have you done to her? Male: It was a spider. Police: Sorry?? Male: It was a spider, a really big one!! Police: What about the woman screaming? Male: Yeah sorry that was me, I really, really hate spiders. What neighbours thought was a serious incidence of domestic violence was in fact the man chasing the arachnid around his home with a can of spider spray. The police report concluded: ""After a very long pause, some laughter and a quick look in the unit to make sure there was no injured party (apart from the spider) we left."""

Stewart Greene, 65, killed Alex Robinson at his Lincoln home while Alex's mother went to buy a turkey. The youngster, who was on the autistic spectrum and hated having water on his face, was playing on his XBox when he was left with Greene. Greene then locked the doors, ran a bath ""with both taps to fill the bath even more quickly"", and drowned his grandson. He then rolled a cigarette and waited for the family to come home, Lincoln Crown Court heard. Alex's mother Joanne Greene returned to find her father sitting calmly on the settee. Greene killed the boy after being let out of a mental health unit The trial heard he told his daughter: ""I've drowned Alex in the bath."" Giving evidence, Ms Greene said her father had been admitted to a mental health unit earlier in the year. A month before Alex's murder, she had pleaded with staff not to let him out. This was because he did not like living independently, and had attacked people before, including trying to strangle a doctor, in attempts to stay as an inpatient, she said. Greene, from Grimoldby, Lincolnshire, had claimed Alex's death on 23 December last year was as a result of diminished responsibility and denied murder. But he changed his plea eight days into his trial, and on Thursday was told he will serve at least 22 years behind bars. Alex was playing on his XBox when he was left alone with Greene During sentencing, Judge Mrs Justice Thirlwall told him: ""The callousness cannot be overstated. ""During the course of this trial, you have sought to manipulate everyone in the court room. ""You manipulate people to get what you want. This was not the product of mental illness, it was wholly your responsibility."" She added: ""Your concern was for yourself - 'will I go to hospital?', 'I can't do prison'. ""You describe yourself as having been selfish all your life, of that there is not the slightest doubt."" Outside court, Alex's father John Robinson, 39, said: ""I'm overwhelmed. We've come a long way, it's been very hard but we have justice for our little boy."""

The PM wants to bomb IS targets in Syria while other countries provide the ground troops, ahead of a long-term political solution. That's the aim anyway. :: How long will action in Syria take? We have no idea. MPs seem to agree there is no quick fix and lessons need to be learned from other conflicts like Iraq and Libya, where post conflict planning was a problem. :: Will there be boots on the ground? David Cameron has ruled out British boots on the ground. He wants to rely on ground troops from Kurdish forces and moderate Syrian groups. :: What will happen if he cannot persuade MPs to vote for action? David Cameron says he will only call a vote if he is certain he will win. Remember, though, Britain has already carried out drone strikes against IS targets in Syria so if there is a clear threat to the UK the military may still act. :: When are they likely to vote on it? We don't have a specific date yet but it is likely to be in the next couple of weeks. :: What does Jeremy Corbyn say? Jeremy Corbyn has laid out seven questions that he wants David Cameron to answer. He said there is no doubt that IS poses a threat to the UK but wants assurances about ground troops and that British involvement will make a difference. :: How will he vote? He has written to Labour MPs saying he cannot support airstrikes. :: Will Labour MPs agree with him? In short - no. Labour are very divided on the issue, and it's unclear whether there will be a free vote or if Labour will be whipped to follow the leadership. :: Will we be at war by Christmas? There's certainly a possibility that we'll be dropping bombs in Syria by Christmas. :: Will Britain's involvement make any difference anyway? With the US, France and Russia already involved, British action will probably not be a game changer. That's why David Cameron is also trying to make a moral case - that it's not right to ""outsource"" our security to other countries."

Some keen consumers braved damp and cold weather to form queues outside a number of stores across the UK from early in the morning but a number of high streets and shopping centres were deserted. Many were instead turning to the web for bargains, with online shoppers expected to spend more than £1bn in a day for the first time. Argos online customers warned over delays Retailers were reporting brisk business over the web - with some sites struggling to handle the volume of customers. The John Lewis site was unavailable for a time mid-afternoon, with the chain blaming ""record"" demand.

This was The Trafford Centre, Manchester, early on The monitoring service Capacitas estimated the failure could have cost the chain £2.8m in lost revenue. It was not the only site to suffer problems. Some retailers imposed access queues to ensure their systems could handle the traffic. Argos customers took to Twitter to complain about  waits and delays to order confirmations. Some users were faced with an on-screen wait countdown with a message telling them: ""Sorry for the delay. Demand for this part of the site is really high."" Nevertheless, Argos reported peak orders of 1,000 per minute. Other chains to feel criticism on site speeds via social media included Boohoo, Tesco and Boots. Currys PC World said five purchases a second were made on its website at the height of the rush - with large TVs shifting at a rate of 100 per minute. Many retailers decided to stretch Black Friday discounts online over several days to try and prevent a sprint for discounts. There were no reports of serious trouble in stores this year. At the Tesco Extra in Burnley - which last year saw chaos as shoppers grappled for electrical bargains - there were more civilised scenes as shoppers were urged to remain calm before entering the store and warned there must be ""no abuse or violence"". But there was still evidence of consumer enthusiasm with one shopper revealing she had spent £300 online on a Playstation and four games before heading to Tesco with her partner, with a plan to move on from there to Argos. She said: ""I haven't been to sleep. I've been up all night shopping. I had the laptop, tablet and mobiles on looking for bargains. We are just greedy."" Asda had previously said it was not taking part in the Black Friday discount day but later announced it was knocking 4p a litre off unleaded petrol for three days to take the price below £1 for the first time since 2009."
