2015-08-14,"The excellent investigation by Stuart Ramsay, Sky's chief correspondent, into Islamic State, shows their open and closed approach to technology.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150814232246/http://news.sky.com/story/1533839/banning-encryption-wont-help-beat-is-threat,"The excellent investigation by Stuart Ramsay, Sky's chief correspondent, into Islamic State, shows their open and closed approach to technology. Open, because they push their propaganda and highly produced videos out through very public channels: Twitter, YouTube and JustPaste.it. The group has a huge and co-ordinated social media presence, as Sky News first reported last summer. That raises the group's profile and fires the frustrated imaginations of young people previously unradicalised. Closed, because when that person decides to go a step further, they are invited off the open web, and on to encrypted messaging services. From plain sight into dark corners. That creates a problem for security services, who say they can't track chats on encrypted messaging services. They include WhatsApp, the most popular messaging app in the world with more than 800 million users. David Cameron has asked: ""In our country, do we want to allow a means of communication between people which we cannot read?"" In another speech he added: ""We just want to ensure that terrorists do not have a safe space in which to communicate."" The so-called Snooper's Charter, or Investigatory Powers Bill, is due to be presented by Theresa May this autumn and is expected to address encryption. The problem is that encryption doesn't give just terrorists a safe space in which to communicate. It gives us all a safe space to communicate. And communication includes things like our online banking and shopping, our personal details. Any attempt to weaken encryption makes us all a bit more unsafe, to hackers, fraudsters and identity thieves, and it would weaken our thriving digital economy. The hack of the US Office of Personnel Management revealed the most intimate details of millions of US citizens. There's no reason to think equivalent UK systems are any safer. So what to do? A ban on encryption simply won't work: the genie is out of the bottle, and the technology widely available. It will hurt only law abiding citizens, not terrorists. Cybersecurity experts and the UN have all warned against banning or weakening encryption, on technical and on human rights grounds. Stuart's investigation points to a solution: months of painstaking work, skilled infiltration and forensic analysis yielded real, useful information. Safe spaces can be made unsafe for terrorists by traditional spycraft and what intelligence agencies call 'computer network exploitation' – hacking, to you and me. The threat is real, as technology constantly evolves. So must the techniques of the security services. Banning encryption would instead be a step backwards."
2015-08-14,Police are searching for an unidentified woman who was seen on CCTV apparently being forced into a car in Bolton.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150814232246/http://news.sky.com/story/1535592/police-hunt-woman-forced-into-a-car-in-bolton,"Police are searching for an unidentified woman who was seen on CCTV apparently being forced into a car in Bolton. The woman was walking from the Moor Lane end of Spa Road in Bolton, next to Queen’s Park when a blue Honda Civic travelling in the same direction pulled up next to the woman. The car was seen swerving to the left, to where the woman was A man got out of the car and opened the door for her to get in. There was a brief struggle between the two and it appeared as if the woman was forced into the back seat of the car against her will. Neither the car nor the woman have been located. Detective Inspector Charlotte Cadden said: ""At this stage, we do not know the circumstances as to why this car stopped, whether the man and woman were known to each other or why she would appear to have been forced into the car. ""However, given what we have seen on CCTV we are concerned for the safety and well-being of this woman and we are very keen for her to come forward and speak to us to let us know she is safe and well. ""I would also urge anyone who witnessed what happened or perhaps knows the location of this car to talk to us as soon as possible."" Greater Manchester police has issued two stills showing a potential witness and the car involved. The possible witness seems to cross the road during the confrontation. She was wearing an orange dress, with her head covered, and carrying a white bag. Anyone with information is asked to call police on 0161 856 5761 or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111."
2015-08-14,"Asda will increase the price it pays its milk supplier to ""a level that will assist"" farmers.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150814232246/http://news.sky.com/story/1535461/asda-to-pay-more-for-milk-to-help-farmers,"Asda will increase the price it pays its milk supplier to ""a level that will assist"" farmers. The supermarket will commit to paying 28p per litre for 100% of its liquid milk volume throughout its entire range. An Asda spokesman said: ""Today, we have confirmed to our milk supplier, Arla, that we are increasing the price we pay per litre from Monday to a level that will assist our farmers during the current crisis. ""Asda's origins are in dairy farming which is why we are acting in the best interests of our farmers and our customers by increasing the price we pay, introducing the Farmer's Marque label and not passing on any of the costs to customers - our retail price stays the same."" The move comes two days after farmers said they had not ruled out continued protests against other supermarkets as Morrisons said the premium from a new milk brand would go directly to the dairy industry. In reaction to Asda's announcement, the National Farmers Union (NFU) president, Meurig Raymond, said: ""The NFU has been lobbying tirelessly for Asda to recognise the plight of the dairy industry so we are pleased that Asda has moved to support farmers in their hour of need. ""It is clear from Asda that this commitment is to support the UK dairy industry at a time of crisis. ""It is now important that Arla ensures this is delivered to British farmers on the ground, with immediate effect. ""This decision recognises that our dairy farmers need a fair price so consumers can ensure they have access to British dairy products now and in the future."" Sainsbury's has claimed it offers dairy farmers more for milk than Asda does - even after this latest price increase - as it is currently paying 30.87p per litre. A spokesperson added: ""Our retail price is not related to the price we pay our farmers. Our milk prices are competitive for our customers, while also paying our dedicated dairy farmers a fair price that protects them against volatile markets. ""Following a majority vote, our Dairy Group farmers benefit from a cost of production model - this sets a price that directly reflects their costs on the farm, building in a profit, as well as rewarding outstanding animal welfare and environmental standards. ""This price is updated every three months to ensure a fair deal for the farmers involved."" Morrisons had been one of the main targets for angry farmers who have removed milk from the shelves before dumping it or giving it away for free. The Bradford-based chain's new milk brand will be launched in October and will be sold at a 10p per litre premium compared to the standard price. David Handley from Farmers For Action said on Tuesday that although direct action would no longer be taken against Morrisons, other supermarkets would be targeted. Mr Handley helped orchestrate recent eye-catching protests that have seen cows brought into supermarket dairy aisles across the country. Leaders from the industry met bosses from Morrisons in an attempt to tackle falling prices which the NFU claims will lead to dairy farmers being forced to leave the industry imminently as they struggle to pay bills and battle rising debts. The NFU and Tenant Farmers Association have called for other retailers to follow Morrisons' lead, saying the industry is in an ""unsustainable"" position as things stand. Farmers estimate that it costs between 30p and 32p to produce a litre of milk, but the average price paid across the UK is 23.66p - after a drop of 25% in a year. Tesco has so far ruled out following Morrisons, saying it already pays a fair price based on the cost of production."
2015-08-14,The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have released a strong warning to paparazzi to stop harassing their children.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150814232246/http://news.sky.com/story/1535714/palace-warns-paparazzi-stay-away-from-george,"By Rhiannon Mills, Royal Correspondent The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have released a strong warning to paparazzi to stop harassing their children. The communications secretary for Kensington Palace has written an open letter to the media, highlighting how Prince George and Princess Charlotte are increasingly under surveillance from unauthorised photographers. The letter praised British, Australian, Canadian and New Zealand media for respecting the family's privacy, adding: ""The Duke and Duchess are glad that leaders in the media industry share the view that every child, regardless of their future public role, deserves a safe, happy, and private childhood."" George arriving at hospital to visit his sister for the first time Thanking the public for messages of support, they also promised that official opportunities to photograph the children would become ""a regular occurrence"" as they grow older. The Metropolitan Police warned that photographers were at risk of being shot by armed officers if it was felt there was a safety or security risk to the royals.  The Duke and Duchess are still ""upset"" that ""a small number of paparazzi photographers"" are going to extreme lengths to satisfy a large international market for unauthorised photos of the children, however. They said long lenses had been used to capture images of the Duchess and Prince George in private parks and to monitor George, his nanny, household staff and visiting children. They said cars leaving the family's homes had been followed and other children had even been used to lure the young prince into the view of photographers while playing in playgrounds. The letter said that, like most parents, the couple enjoyed sharing photos of their children, but added that every parent would object to anyone - particularly strangers - taking photos of their children without permission. ""Every parent would understand their deep unease at only learning they had been followed and watched days later when photographs emerged,"" it added. The letter added that Prince George is currently that market's ""number one target"" and the decision had been made to ""discuss"" this as incidents became ""more frequent and the tactics more alarming"". One incident last week was described as ""disturbing but not at all uncommon"". A photographer had rented a car and parked in a discreet location outside a children's play area. Gallery: Duchess Of Cambridge's Pictures Of Her Little Prince And Princess The photos were taken by the Duchess of Cambridge in the middle of May Concealed by darkened windows, he also hung sheets inside the vehicle and created a hide stocked with food and drinks to get him through a full day of surveillance, waiting in hope to capture images of Prince George, the palace said. Police discovered him lying in the boot of the vehicle trying to take photos with a long lens through a small gap in his hide. The palace's letter added: ""It is of course upsetting that such tactics – reminiscent as they are of past surveillance by groups intent on doing more than capturing images – are being deployed to profit from the image of a two-year old boy. ""In a heightened security environment such tactics are a risk to all involved. The worry is that it will not always be possible to quickly distinguish between someone taking photos and someone intending to do more immediate harm."" Gallery: Prince George: William And Kate's First Child The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge released new photos of their son as he prepared to celebrate his second Christmas Kensington Palace has said that legal steps are being taken to safeguard the family but they hope the letter will encourage public debate and help publishers of unauthorised photos of the children to understand the power they hold to ""starve this disturbing activity of funding"". The Met Police said: ""At a time when the national security threat level from international terrorism is at severe, all officers are at a heightened level of readiness. ""Officers involved in the security of protected people are armed and have to constantly assess security risks. ""Photographers using covert tactics often come to the attention of armed officers who take steps to stop and verify the details of those who raise suspicions. Gallery: George's First Official Engagement Prince George shows he is growing up fast as he joins a baby playgroup for the first time while visiting Wellington, New Zealand. ""Photographers are potentially putting themselves at risk from armed intervention where our armed officers perceive a risk to the personal safety of their principal, the public and themselves."" Paddy Harverson, former communications secretary to the Royal family said the situation was ""palpably worse than in the 1980s"". ""There’s a lot more freelance paparazzi out there that don’t obey anyone's rules and I think there’s a media obsession with very young children and babies of the famous, the celebrity, in this case the royals, and therefore there’s a bigger market than there was back in the 80s,"" he said.  Sky News does not publish images of the Royal family taken by unauthorised photographers."

The road is closed in both directions, according to Transport for Greater Manchester - which is warning of delays and advising people to take alternative routes. The hole is at the eastern end of the road, between the junctions of the A6 London Road and Fairfield Street. It opened up after midday and a workman told the Manchester Evening News there were concerns it could spread to the other side of the carriageway. The city has been lashed by heavy rain today, and Mancunian Way was earlier closed due to flooding. The rain has also caused delays on the city's trains. In a statement, Manchester City Council said: ""Motorists should be aware that part of the Mancunian Way is currently closed in both directions due to a collapse in the road caused by the extremely wet weather. ""It is thought a culvert beneath the Mancunian Way has been eroded by the heavy rainfall which has caused the road above to be impacted. ""City council and United Utilities officers are currently at the scene to assess the situation. ""Depending on the extent of the issue the road may remain closed over the weekend. ""Traffic will be diverted via London Road, Fairfield Street, A665, Hyde Road and Downing Street."" Football fans heading to Manchester City's game against Chelsea on Sunday are being warned to check on the latest situation before they travel."

Sven Latteyer thought the 15 asylum seekers who boarded his bus in the city of Erlangen seemed in need of cheering up, perhaps feeling a bit lost in a new country, he told thelocal.de. Mr Latteyer, who is reported to be 42, said he managed to string together a few sentences in English, saying: ""I have an important message for all people from the whole world in this bus: I want to say welcome. ""Welcome to Germany, welcome to my country. Have a nice day!"" One passenger posted about the moment on Facebook, where thousands of people read how the speech was greeted with ""incredulous looks, then all laughing and clapping, the whole bus, including the Germans"" and ""one of the African boys wiped a little tear from his eyes"". Gallery: Plight Of Refugees On Greek Island Of Kos A dinghy overcrowded with Syrian refugees off the Greek island of Kos Mr Latteyer told nordbayern.de he had been inspired to welcome the newcomers through knowing the experiences of his Kosovan brother-in-law and his German grandfather who lost his arm in World War Two. He said: ""My brother-in-law doesn't talk a lot about the years 1998 and 1999 when the war was raging in Kosovo. He's trying to forget the horror."" Mr Latteyer, who is also a volunteer firefighter, added that war is ""horrific"" and anyone fleeing it should be given refuge in Germany. He said he wasn't sure how he could help the migrants but the answer turned out to be simple: ""Saying 'hey guys, you're really welcome'."" The story even touched TV presenter Claus Kleber, who appeared teary as he reported it on ZDF television's daily news. The number of people seeking asylum in European countries has increased substantially, with most coming from places such as Syria, Afghanistan and Eritrea. Gallery: Desperate Syrians Flee To Turkish Border A Syrian refugee reacts as he waits behind border fences to cross into Turkey at Akcakale border gate in Sanliurfa province Germany has received almost 180,000 applications for asylum in the first half of this year - twice the number it had received during the same period last year. Erlangen's local government says about a quarter of the population there - around 27,000 people - have an immigrant background. But not everybody has been as welcoming of the newcomers, with a surge in attacks on their accommodation, including vandalism and arson by far right groups."

Aran Khanna's mapping tool showed Facebook Messenger users how to pinpoint the exact locations of anyone in their conversation thread, even those they were not friends with. The computer science and mathematics student posted the plugin, Marauder's Map, from his Harvard dormitory room in May. The Google Chrome extension, which made use of Facebook Messenger's default geolocation sharing, was downloaded 85,000 times. The app was called Marauder's Map, a Harry Potter reference Mr Khanna said he posted a blog about the app on Reddit and Medium on 26 May. He said Facebook called him in the following days asking him not to speak to the press and to delete the extension. Mr Khanna said he duly complied with both requests. Three days after posting the app, Mr Khanna says Facebook told him they were withdrawing his internship offer. Facebook itself was launched from a Harvard dorm room in 2004 He said he received an email saying ""my blog post did not reflect the 'high ethical standards' around user privacy expected of interns"". Facebook released a Messenger app update a week later that it said addressed the privacy flaw. Company spokesman Matt Steinfeld told Sky News the update had been in development for months. He said Mr Khanna had scraped data from Facebook in a way that violated its user agreement terms. Mr Steinfeld added: ""We don't dismiss employees for exposing privacy flaws, but we do take it seriously when someone misuses user data and puts people at risk.""  Mr Khanna wrote a case study this week for a Harvard publication about his experience. He concluded: ""What does this say about privacy protection? ""Can we reasonably expect Facebook or others with an interest in collecting and sharing personal data to be responsible guardians of privacy?""

2015-08-14,More rain is set to hit parts of Britain today after heavy downpours caused flooding yesterday.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150814232246/http://news.sky.com/story/1535477/britain-set-for-more-rain-after-flooding,"More rain is set to hit parts of Britain today after heavy downpours caused flooding yesterday. More than a month's rain fell in just a few hours on Thursday, but the weekend is set to bring settled weather. Before then, northern England, southern Scotland, across Wales, the West Midlands and parts of the South West will see showers. Flooding in Fallowfield, Manchester. Pic: Tony Minshall The South East is expected to become drier this morning, but outbreaks of rain will push in from the West later. While it could brighten up in places, there remains a risk of heavy showers. Met Office forecaster Marco Petagna said: ""The main trend through the day is for the rain to gradually push its way eastwards with brighter fresher conditions starting to move in from the west and that sort of sets the scene really for the weekend. ""A much quieter spell of weather - a lot of dry bright weather around this weekend. A few showers, mainly towards the north and west, but a lot of dry weather this weekend. ""Certainly a fresher feel to the weather compared to the last couple of days."" On Thursday, a weather warning was issued for parts of the country after torrential downpours and thunderstorms increased the likelihood of flooding. The Met Office upgraded its yellow warning to amber for the east and southeast of England after more than a month's rain fell in nine hours. That warning has since expired. The average amount of rainfall in August is 51.6mm. Eastbourne town centre saw 60mm of rain between 3am and midday on Thursday, with the majority falling in the last two hours, the Met Office said. East Sussex, and in particular Brighton, seemed to experience the worst of the storms, with many people posting pictures on social media of calf-high water running through the street. East Sussex Rescue Service was called to 32 reports of flooding, some including water affecting electrics, between 4.05am and 12.50pm on Thursday. Firefighters in Kent went to two homes in the Ashford area following lightning strikes, although there were no injuries. At one home in Great Chart, a fire was extinguished by crews and they also went to flooding in New Romney, Canterbury and Tunbridge Wells. Eastbourne's Airbourne airshow cancelled its flying displays for the day because of the downpours, and the town's Arndale shopping centre had to be evacuated because of flooding, but it later reopened."

""This has been an extremely long journey for Mr Fogle, who has always maintained his innocence of the 1976 crime,"" said David Loftis, of the Innocence Project. District Attorney Patrick Dougherty conceded the conviction ought to be thrown out after agreeing to the new DNA test. But he told Reuters news agency he does not believe Fogle is wholly innocent of involvement in Miss Long's death. The prosecutor said he would decide by next month whether to retry Fogle. Fogle has been released on a bail bond as he remains charged. He was among four men arrested in 1981 after a mental health patient identified them under hypnosis as suspects. Fogle was convicted of second-degree murder based on the testimony of three jailhouse informants. Charges against his three co-defendants were dropped for lack of evidence. The district attorney said he would seek DNA from two of the other three men originally charged who are still alive."

Navinder Singh Sarao, who has been dubbed ""The Hound of Hounslow"" after purportedly manipulating US stocks from his parents' home in west London, had previously said he would be unable to post his £5m bail bill. Prosecutors now say they know where Sarao's assets are after he made a declaration, and in return have reduced his bail to £50,000. Mark Summers, representing the US government, said: ""He has disclosed the whereabouts of further assets owned by a company called IGC based in Angola, which has in turn invested its monies of £25m in Switzerland."" Westminster Magistrates' Court heard how it could take years for the money being held in Swiss banks to be repatriated to the US. Although Sarao's assets have been frozen, he is allowed to use £2.5m of the funds for his legal fees and expenses. The 36-year-old only spoke to confirm that he understands his bail terms – and District Judge Quentin Purdie warned him not to access the internet for any fiscal transactions once he is released. He was also told to stay within the M25 and regularly report to police. Sarao is still facing extradition to the US over claims that he made millions using an ""automated trading programme"" – and helped cause the Dow Jones index plunge 600 points in five minutes back in May 2010. If extradited, he would answer 22 charges including wire fraud, commodities fraud and market manipulation, and could face a sentence of 380 years if convicted. He has previously told the court he had ""not done anything wrong, apart from being good at my job"". An extradition hearing will take place in September, and his lawyers will have an opportunity to request it is delayed later this month."

Dr Mario Villalba, director of the Red Cross hospital in Asuncion, told local radio the baby was delivered by caesarean section and was doing well. ""A baby girl, weighing 3.5kg (7lb 11oz), was born without any complications or anomalies,"" he said. ""The post-operative recovery is going very well."" The authorities' handling of the case sparked outrage in the overwhelmingly Catholic country, where abortion is illegal except when the mother's life is at risk. When the case came to light in May, the unnamed girl was 10 years old and 22 weeks pregnant. Gilberto Benitez Zarate has been charged with rape International humanitarian groups argued the girl's body was not able to support her pregnancy and her life was in danger. But the government, courts, the Catholic Church and other groups insisted the pregnancy should not be terminated, partly due to its advanced stage. After the birth, Erika Guevara, Amnesty's director for the Americas, said: ""Only time will tell the true extent of the physical and psychological consequences of her tragic ordeal. ""It is terrifying that her story will remain all too common unless Paraguay does more to protect victims of sexual violence, decriminalise abortion and guarantee the availability of modern contraceptives and access to information about sexual and reproductive rights."" The girl's 42-year-old stepfather, Gilberto Benitez Zarate, was arrested in May and is awaiting trial on rape charges. He faces 15 years in prison if convicted of rape. Zarate has denied the charges and claimed he had been set up by his girlfriend, the girl's mother. The girl's mother has been charged with negligence."

It led us to a married couple - Junaid, or Abu, Hussain, and Sally Jones, known as Umm Hussain. They're both from Britain and living in Raqqa. Hussain, 21, is from Birmingham and is in charge of IS recruitment. He is also a former computer hacker and has the dubious honour of being in the top five of IS operatives most likely to be killed by an American drone. During the course of our initial contacts he realised he was talking to a female and suggested she talk to his wife. Jones - originally from Chatham in Kent - recruits women and girls from Britain. She sent a bomb-making manual to our female character via a secure-sharing site, telling us that she had another girl in Glasgow ready to attack. Specifically, she mentioned the Royal Family and the date of 15 August - the day of the VJ commemorations in London. She also told our character that two other girls had been recruited but had failed to carry out a promised attack. Security contacts have confirmed to us that the existence of these three potential bombers is a genuine concern. The key to running our characters has been to keep them ""real"". Our investigator and I would talk at length every day or at least every day there was contact and we would agree a line of questioning or response. Not asking too many questions and being apparently utterly committed to the jihadist cause was vital. Perhaps our most successful move was to buy up all the items needed to make a bomb and prove to Jones that we had bought them and that day. It was not difficult to do. A fact not lost on the authorities. We suspect that she was testing our commitment but it is likely it was a test of our status. If our characters were on a watch list and bought a pressure cooker we are pretty certain, as are the IS team, that we would have been lifted by the authorities. The revelation from Jones, true or otherwise, that she was handling another three would-be bombers was our cue to contact the authorities immediately. Sky News has always felt a moral obligation to do this, but there is quite simply a legal requirement to do so as well. It was never in doubt we would make the call as soon as we realised there was a genuine risk that we were talking to people actively involved in a real terror plot. The anti-terror officers met us and agreed we should continue our contacts with the IS people. With the cyber operation slowly bubbling along, I made contact with our sources in Syria and Turkey to see if there was more to support a second strand to this story that IS has changed its policy towards European and, particularly, British jihadists. No longer are they calling on ""Brothers and Sisters"" to come to their so-called caliphate in Syria and Iraq. Rather, they are insisting that they stay at home and plot with their help to blow themselves up or to kill people here. In Turkey, amid very, very high security concerns, we found our movements badly restricted. Turkish security took to following our movements as soon as we arrived in the city of Urfa, not far from the Syrian border. This is the route IS volunteers and defectors for that matter, pass through either going in or out. My meeting with a former IS internal security officer took place in a secret location I arrived at by foot, having lost our tail in the teeming streets of the city's ancient souk. His revelations that four or five British men have spent six weeks on a series of terror courses and have now returned to the UK on a ""mission"" has been passed to the authorities as well. It's impossible to know if any of this is true, of course. But we suspect much of it is. At the very least it indicates how determined IS are to strike in the UK and just how much work the authorities are faced with every day as they try to keep everyone safe."
2015-08-14,A source close to Yvette Cooper's Labour leadership campaign has told Sky News their camp is expecting an endorsement from Gordon Brown.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150814232246/http://news.sky.com/story/1535425/brown-expected-to-endorse-cooper-for-leader,"By Jason Farrell, Senior Political Correspondent A source close to Yvette Cooper's Labour leadership campaign has told Sky News their camp is expecting an endorsement from Gordon Brown. There have been rumours the former prime minister may state his views on the leadership race, and one senior figure close to Ms Cooper says it is just ""a matter of time"". This comes after The Guardian newspaper endorsed Ms Cooper's campaign, while the Daily Mirror came out in support of Andy Burnham. A spokesperson for the Yvette Cooper campaign said: ""When and who others endorse is entirely a matter for them."" Ballots go out to members today - less than a week after one poll suggested Jeremy Corbyn was on course for a landslide victory. :: The Labour leadership candidates But in an interview with Sky News, Ms Cooper said she was not convinced Mr Corbyn wanted to be Prime Minister. ""I actually asked him that question at a Labour hustings, whether he really wanted to be Prime Minister, and it actually took Jeremy a long time to reply... I'm not convinced (that he wants to) but he has to answer that question,"" she said. ""I'm not questioning Jeremy's values or his commitment to the Labour Party, I just disagree with him on the answers. ""I don't think he'd be the best person to be strong enough to take on the Tories now, and strong enough to win us the next election. ""He has the wrong answers for the country."" Some supporters of Mr Burnham have suggested the move to attack Mr Corbyn could lose Ms Cooper votes. But the shadow home secretary said: ""I don't think you can just pander or pretend that you agree with somebody, when you don't and I think it is about the whole future of the party."" :: The Labour leadership election explained Mr Corbyn has set the Labour campaign on fire - leaving some in the party wanting to find a big enough candidate to smother the flames. In second place, Mr Burnham believes he is the only candidate who can do it, and his campaign will be fuelled by support from the Mirror.  Mr Burnham has refused to suggest Mr Corbyn has got it all wrong. He told Sky News: ""I think if you just dismiss what Jeremy is saying you may end up misreading the mood of the party. ""Labour members are crying out for a change in the way we've done politics. ""They want a different style. They want more substance. ""They are fed up with being on the doorsteps with very little to offer voters."" Meanwhile, Liz Kendall is setting off on a UK-wide tour this weekend to drum up support. The same polls that have suggested Mr Corbyn could get a landslide victory have also put Ms Kendall at the back of the field, with bookies now offering odds of 100-1. Responding to the odds, Ms Kendall told Sky News: ""I am a long shot without a doubt. ""Take a risk with me and you'll get great returns."" The mainstream MPs within the party remain concerned about whether the surge in new supporters can be properly vetted. They say the £3 entry for supporters was supposed to diversify the voter pool, not plunge it left. Equally, a left-wing outsider slipping onto the ballot was supposed to broaden not dominate the debate. Events appear to have worked out differently."

Liverpool coroner Andre Rebello recorded a verdict of accidental death after reading out details to a hearing in the city. He said Cilla, who was 72, was a ""daughter of Liverpool"" and was celebrated by everyone there. Cilla's three sons - Ben, Robert and Jack - sat in court for the 15-minute hearing. Her son Robert wiped away tears and sighed as details of her death were read out in the court.  Gallery: 'Liverpool's Cinderella': City Mourns Cilla Black Liverpool is in mourning after the death of Cilla Black, who was born in the city in 1943 Addressing her sons, the coroner said: ""She was your mum and her death is a private personal matter and we have all got one mum. ""It is right that you grieve and remember her."" Mr Rebello continued: ""Far more important is that you celebrate her life, but your mum was far more than just your mum. ""She was a daughter of Liverpool and she was a celebrity and loved by all in Liverpool and that will be part of her abiding memory and memorial. ""But you will have personal, private memories of her as mum. ""It is those memories of the ordinary things she did, normal family events, the love shared and the love given, that must be her abiding memory, not just for this generation, but for each born in the future."" The coroner added that the investigation by Spanish authorities had been thorough. No witnesses were called at the hearing. The proceedings were postponed an hour before they were due to begin yesterday after it was realised the star's body was not in the city."
2015-08-14,A young firefighter has been pulled alive from the wreckage of the Tianjin explosions which killed at least 56 people and injured more than 700.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150814232246/http://news.sky.com/story/1535420/firefighter-pulled-from-tianjin-blast-wreckage,"A young firefighter has been pulled alive from the wreckage of the Tianjin explosions which killed at least 56 people and injured more than 700. The 19-year-old, named Zhou Ti, had been trapped for 32 hours after responding to the two huge explosions in the Chinese port city. China Central Television (CCTV) reported he is in a stable condition at a hospital in Tianjin, but has burns on his face, an injured leg and is suffering from smoke inhalation. Zhou Ti, 19, in a hospital bed after he was rescued from the wreckage At least 21 of his colleagues have been confirmed dead. Eighteen are still missing and 66 have been taken to hospital. Zhang Dapeng, chief of staff of the Bonded Zone Branch of Tianjin Firefighting Corps, said the firefighter had been choking when he was found. He added: ""I think it's his strong will which helped him to hold on. ""When talking with him, I could feel his strong inner power, and we also kept pepping him up, urging him to hold on and telling him the ambulance was arriving."" Several fire trucks were destroyed in the blasts and nearby firefighters wept as they worked to extinguish flames, the Beijing News reported. Meanwhile, more than 200 nuclear and biochemical experts from the Chinese military and a team from the International Atomic Energy Agency's Beijing environmental emergency response centre are assessing the area surrounding the blasts. Gallery: Search For Victims After Chinese Port Explosions Zhang Yibi (R) shows a picture of her son Lei Chi, 21, a firefighter who is among those missing after the huge explosion at the port in Tianjin, China, as they look for him at hospital China has launched a nationwide inspection of dangerous chemicals and explosives, with The State Council - the country's equivalent of the Cabinet, saying the country must learn a ""profound"" lesson from the explosions. The blasts struck a warehouse of hazardous chemicals at a port and were so large they were seen by satellites in space, sending shockwaves through apartment blocks a number of miles away. The exact cause is not yet known, but China's President Xi Jinping has demanded those responsible are ""severely handled"". Witnesses reported crumpled shipping containers being thrown around like matchsticks, hundreds of new cars being set alight and port buildings turned into burnt-out shells. Thousands of residents have been moved to nearby schools after homes and apartment buildings were damaged, mostly by the shockwaves from the blasts, the official Xinhua news agency said. Approximately 1,000 firefighters in more than 140 fire engines struggled to contain a blaze in a warehouse that held ""dangerous goods"", according to Xinhua. With smoke still billowing from three parts of the site, there are concerns chemicals may be leaking. The first explosion, equivalent to three tonnes of TNT, happened at around 11.30pm local time on Wednesday night, CCTV reported. The second explosion, which was equivalent to 21 tonnes of TNT, happened about 30 seconds after the initial blast. There was also a third smaller blast on Friday. Authorities said the explosions were at the warehouse owned by Ruihai Logistics, a company that says it stores hazardous materials including flammable petrochemicals, sodium cyanide and toluene diisocyanate. State media said senior management at the firm have been detained by authorities and the government has assured a sceptical public that the air around the site is not contaminated. An assessment by government inspectors published last year said the complex was designed to store dangerous and toxic chemicals including butanone, an explosive industrial solvent, sodium cyanide and compressed natural gas. The warehouse was storing mainly ammonium nitrate, potassium nitrate and calcium carbide at the time, according to police. Chemical safety experts said calcium carbide reacts with water to create acetylene, a highly explosive gas, and an explosion could be caused if the firefighters had sprayed the calcium carbide with water. Lei Jinde, deputy propaganda department head of China's fire department, told state-backed news website ThePaper.cn the first group of firefighters on the scene had used water. He said: ""We knew there was calcium carbide inside but we didn't know whether it had already exploded. ""At that point no one knew. ""It wasn't that the firefighters were stupid,"" he said, adding that they did not know exactly where the calcium carbide was."
2015-08-14,British athletes have hit out over the absence of the Union Jack flag on part of their kit for the upcoming World Championships in Beijing.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150814232246/http://news.sky.com/story/1535628/gb-athletes-in-missing-union-jack-flag-row,"British athletes have hit out over the absence of the Union Jack flag on part of their kit for the upcoming World Championships in Beijing. Olympic long jump champion Greg Rutherford was the first to complain when he tweeted a picture of the kit's top and posted a comment alongside. He said:  ""Well this isn't right ... Where's the Union Jack!?!? @BritAthletics (this is the kit for worlds)."" Several present and former members of the British athletics team joined him in criticising the lack of the national flag. The top is similar in style to the one team members have been wearing in recent months, with a blue and white front, separated by a chevron, and red sides. But, unlike the one he wore in July, Rutherford's top shows the logo of British Athletics rather than the flag. Britain's Greg Rutherford competes in the Anniversary Games in July He added: ""I'm yet to find an athlete who wanted the change. EVERY athlete I've spoken to wants the Union flag. ""Most annoyingly about all this is that the kit itself is amazing! IMO the best kit to compete in material-wise. Just looks s***."" Paralympic 2012 quadruple gold medallist David Weir replied to Rutherford, adding: ""We all put the kit on for the flag. And I couldn't see any other country do it."" Steeplechaser Eilish McColgan said: ""It's unfair for athletes not supported by UKA to have to wear it ... Doesn't make any sense! Bring back the flag!"" Dame Kelly Holmes, a double Olympic champion at Athens in 2004, responded on Twitter: ""Totally agree. The Union Jack is iconic."" Shadow culture, media and sport secretary Chris Bryant lent his support, tweeting: ""Yes @GregJRutherford is right. That vest could easily be French or American. ""Where is the Union flag? Is someone embarrassed to be British?"" The full British kit posted on Instagram by athlete Cindy Ofili Rutherford pointed out that the 2012 London Olympics kit for Team GB - designed by Stella McCartney - featured a Union Jack flag prominently. British Athletics did not respond to the complaints directly but retweeted an Instagram post from hurdler Cindy Ofili, who said: ""Excited to have finally received my first full British Kit!! Thanks britishathletics"". The kit that she had laid out appeared to have several items that sported Union Jack flags. A spokesman later told Sky News: ""In regards to the new kit design, we would reassure athletes and fans that the Union Flag remains an integral part of the British Athletics team kit, and is included on the majority of items worn by the team, complemented by the words Great Britain across the chest. ""The inclusion of the British Athletics team name and logo is to help create a strong team identity for the British Athletics team. ""This follows the tradition of the vast majority of other Olympic sports, such as swimming and cycling, who have used their team name and logo on kit design for years, and creates a powerful team identity. ""This approach was also adopted very successfully by TeamGB when, in 2012, they replaced the traditional Union Flag with the TeamGB logo that resonated so strongly with the British public."" A total of 63 athletes are being sent to China for the World Athletics Championships, captained by 400m runner Martyn Rooney."

James Young was hit by the 57mph Raptor ride at the Cedar Point amusement park on Thursday. Police said Mr Young had just been on the ride when he jumped over a fence ""to retrieve something he had dropped"". The Erie County coroner said the item was a mobile phone. The amusement park sits along Lake Erie in Sandusky and describes itself as the ""rollercoaster capital of the world"". The park confirmed the death in a statement saying ""a guest entered a restricted, fenced area of Raptor and was struck by the ride"". It added that its ""thoughts and prayers go out to the family""."

Sven Latteyer thought the 15 asylum seekers who boarded his bus in the city of Erlangen seemed in need of cheering up, perhaps feeling a bit lost in a new country, he told thelocal.de. Mr Latteyer, who is reported to be 42, said he managed to string together a few sentences in English, saying: ""I have an important message for all people from the whole world in this bus: I want to say welcome. ""Welcome to Germany, welcome to my country. Have a nice day!"" One passenger posted about the moment on Facebook, where thousands of people read how the speech was greeted with ""incredulous looks, then all laughing and clapping, the whole bus, including the Germans"" and ""one of the African boys wiped a little tear from his eyes"". Gallery: Plight Of Refugees On Greek Island Of Kos A dinghy overcrowded with Syrian refugees off the Greek island of Kos Mr Latteyer told nordbayern.de he had been inspired to welcome the newcomers through knowing the experiences of his Kosovan brother-in-law and his German grandfather who lost his arm in World War Two. He said: ""My brother-in-law doesn't talk a lot about the years 1998 and 1999 when the war was raging in Kosovo. He's trying to forget the horror."" Mr Latteyer, who is also a volunteer firefighter, added that war is ""horrific"" and anyone fleeing it should be given refuge in Germany. He said he wasn't sure how he could help the migrants but the answer turned out to be simple: ""Saying 'hey guys, you're really welcome'."" The story even touched TV presenter Claus Kleber, who appeared teary as he reported it on ZDF television's daily news. The number of people seeking asylum in European countries has increased substantially, with most coming from places such as Syria, Afghanistan and Eritrea. Gallery: Desperate Syrians Flee To Turkish Border A Syrian refugee reacts as he waits behind border fences to cross into Turkey at Akcakale border gate in Sanliurfa province Germany has received almost 180,000 applications for asylum in the first half of this year - twice the number it had received during the same period last year. Erlangen's local government says about a quarter of the population there - around 27,000 people - have an immigrant background. But not everybody has been as welcoming of the newcomers, with a surge in attacks on their accommodation, including vandalism and arson by far right groups."
2015-08-15,It is more than three months since David Cameron secured a shock majority in the General Election. Sky's Sophy Ridge takes a look at what the PM has got up to since he stepped back into Downing Street.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150815113448/http://news.sky.com/story/1536078/camerons-first-100-days-what-has-the-pm-done,"It is more than three months since David Cameron secured a shock majority in the General Election. Sky's Sophy Ridge takes a look at what the PM has got up to since he stepped back into Downing Street. 1. First things first. Mr Cameron won the election. Which is pretty obvious, since that is why we are here. 2. The newly elected Prime Minister ordered champagne to No 10 to celebrate the first Conservative majority government for nearly 20 years. 3. He also got a swanky freebie hamper from Fortnum and Mason. 4. Some of his aides held a Club Tropicana party - because the year the song came out (1983) was the last time an incumbent Prime Minister increased his majority. Cameron's new Cabinet had some familiar faces 5. Mr Cameron then formed a Cabinet which was pretty much the same as the last one. It had the same Chancellor, Home Secretary, Foreign Secretary, Defence Secretary, Education Secretary, Health Secretary ... the list goes on. 6. Apart from Business Secretary Sajid Javid. He was new. 7. And Michael Gove moved to the Department of Justice, where he swapped being a thorn in the side of teachers to being a thorn in the side of lawyers. 8. Mr Cameron also promoted more women to Cabinet. 9. And allowed cameras in for the first time, so we can see them in action. 10. Now for the first meaty piece of legislation: the EU Reform Bill. Legislation paving the way for an in-out referendum on Britain's membership of the EU has nearly finished its passage through the Commons. 11. The PM knows that if he is to get the result he wants, he needs to renegotiate Britain's relationship with Europe. So he kicked off a whistle stop tour to try and convince other leaders - starting with Dutch Prime Minister, Mark Rutte. Cameron complained his jet-setting meant he wasn't beach body ready 12. Then it was off to Paris to butter up French President Francois Hollande. 13. ... and Poland, to meet Ewa Kopacz. 14. ... before flying to Germany to cosy up to Angela Merkel. (I am exhausted just thinking of it.) 15. He did not go to Denmark to meet his fave EU ally Helle Thorning-Schmidt (remember THAT selfie with Obama???) - aka Mrs Stephen Kinnock. Unfortunately for Dave, she called a snap general election ... and lost.   16. But Mr Cameron DID meet arch-nemesis Jean-Claude Juncker, who he tried to block from becoming EU Council President. He must REALLY want this whole EU reform thing. 17. This guy is on a serious charm offensive - and even Barack Obama weighed in on the issue, telling the PM at G7 that he was ""looking forward to Britain sticking with the EU. 18. The problem is - nobody took much notice because they were too distracted by the crisis in Greece. Think of all those wasted air miles. 19. There was another downside to his EU tour. Mr Cameron blamed all the posh dinners and three course breakfasts for the fact he was not as beach body ready as his wife Sam Cam, who was busy looking fantastic in a black bikini while he was darting across the continent. He explained: ""I'm not as good at controlling what goes in."" 20. His waistline was probably also not helped by a trip to South East Asia. Papilionanda David Cameron, an orchid named for the Prime Minister 21. Although on the plus side, he did have an orchid named after him in Singapore 22. The PM hopes he will be more successful in controlling the benefits bill - he has stuck to his promise of £12bn welfare cuts, which many thought he would quietly drop. 23. He cut the welfare cap from £26,000 to £20,000 - or £23,000 in London. The Conservative manifesto only talked about cutting it to £23,000. 24. Working age benefits have been frozen for four years 25. Pensions tax relief has been cut... 26. And tax credits have been seriously squeezed - with £5bn of cuts by 2020. 27. Despite this, the Prime Minister has been forced to admit the deficit will be cleared later than planned - with a promise to get the budget in surplus by 2019/20, a year later than he originally said. 28. After all that hard work, it was time for a holiday. So the PM went to his favourite staycation destination: Cornwall. 29. This is mainly memorable because he wore Fit Flops (Sam Cam - how could you let him?!) 30. And THAT blue shirt ... you know, the same one he always wears in his holiday snaps? Smart casual is SUCH a hard look for a Prime Minister to nail. 31. The Cameron family then packed up and jetted off to Portugal for holiday number two. Cameron sent sniffer dogs as the migrant crisis in Calais gained momentum 32 …. where he had to receive medical treatment for ""swimmers ear"" - or inflammation of the ear canal. Not great for chillaxing. 33. Also not great for chillaxing? The fact that Calais erupted into crisis, with thousands of people trying to make the crossing from France to the UK. 34. David Cameron was not prepared to interrupt his holiday. But that was totally fine because he sent lots of sniffer dogs. 35. Also - tall fences. 36. And he allowed Ministry of Defence land in Kent to be used as a giant lorry park. (This is not a joke. It actually happened.) 37. He has also chaired a LOT of Cobra meetings. COBRA - the tough sounding emergency committee that actually stands for Cabinet Office Briefing Room A - is the PM's favourite way to show he is really on top of a crisis. 38. Mr Cameron also unveiled a raft of REALLY TOUGH new policies to show the government has GOT A GRIP on the migrant crisis. For instance, he promised to stop benefits for failed asylum seekers. 39. Landlords who knowingly give accommodation to illegal immigrants could also face up to five years in jail. 40. The Prime Minister did get into some hot water when he described a ""swarm"" of migrants trying to get to the UK. Some felt that was dehumanising. 41. Number 10 also declined to slap down Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond who said the migrants were ""marauding"". According to the Oxford English Dictionary, marauding means ""going about in search of things to steal or attack"". Which, some felt, was a bit much. 42. David Cameron is also pushing through an Immigration Bill. Cameron wore the blue shirt he seems to keep for holiday photos 43. People in customer-facing public sector jobs must be able to speak English. 44. And firms will not be able to recruit from abroad without also advertising in the UK. 45. Mr Cameron has refused to back down from his promise to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands - even though he is nowhere close. 46. But he is doing much, much better on poverty. In fact - it has been abolished! (or at least, poverty targets have been.) 47. Mr Cameron called for a ""big conversation"" on ... seagulls. Yes, that is not a joke. He told BBC Radio Cornwall ""we do have a problem"" about aggressive seagulls. 48. There has been some good news for families and employees struggling on low incomes - Mr Cameron has announced he will legislate to create a new living wage. 49. Plus, he is doubling the amount of free childcare for working parents. 50. However, it is not good news for everyone - child tax credits will be limited to the first two children. 51. Plus - not everyone is celebrating a pay rise. The government is continuing to cap public sector pay rises at one per cent a year, right up until the next general election. This means public sector workers face a full decade of wage restraint. Ouch. 52. He has also frozen ministerial pay. We are all in this together... Cameron has called for a ""big conversation"" on seagulls 53. … or are we? Because MPs will still be getting a 10% pay rise. David Cameron says he does not agree with it, but he is not prepared to overrule the expenses watchdog IPSA. 54. He also used the words ""we are all in this together"" in a speech about terrorism - rather than the economy. 55. And floated the idea of British involvement in air strikes in Syria. 56. In his spare time since the election, David Cameron is often seen out running (maybe so he can escape from all those angry civil servants who are not getting a pay rise). 57. He even interrupted an outside broadcast by This Morning. Presenter Amanda Holden could not quite believe it when she saw the Prime Minister jogging through her set on London's Southbank. 58. All that exercise is clearly paying off. Uber-cool super model Poppy Delevigne admitted she ""quite fancies him"" in an interview with her sister Cara. David Cameron - sex symbol! 59. If social media is anything to go by, he has had selfies taken with a LOT of people. 60. Mr Cameron does not have every leggy blonde falling at his feet, though. Tennis ace Maria Sharapova did not see the funny side when the Prime Minister cracked a joke at her expense, saying you need earplugs at her matches. 61. He made this joke to the England Women's football team, who the PM hosted at Downing Street to celebrate their World Cup performance. Miodel Poppy Delevingne says she ""quite fancies"" the PM 62. Mr and Mrs Cameron also invited Michelle Obama to No 10 during her two day trip to the UK with her daughters. 63. One chunky piece of legislation that could define Mr Cameron's government is the Scotland Bill. Work has started on new laws that would transfer more powers to Scotland, after the impressive general election results achieved by the SNP. 64. To try and thrash out agreement, Mr Cameron travelled to meet with SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon at Bute House in Edinburgh. Oh to be a fly on that wall. 65. Their relationship has not always run smoothly, however. Mr Cameron had to shelve plans for a vote on fox hunting after the SNP decided to vote against the change. 66. That just goes to show that he may have won a surprise election victory, but he has a really, really small majority. Which could be tricky in the future. 67. He also put off a vote on plans for English votes for English laws, despite originally promising to settle the issue before the summer recess. 68. That is not the only thing Mr Cameron has kicked into the long grass. The Davies Commission unequivocally recommended expanding Heathrow Airport. The Prime Minister reacted by delaying a decision ... that could not have anything to do with the Tory constituencies in the Heathrow flight path, could it? 69. Mr Cameron also launched a ""consultation"" on shops opening times on Sundays. That is what politicians do when they know something is going to be controversial. US First Lady Michelle Obama came to visit 70. There are a few other things that the Prime Minister has been strangely silent about. Remember the Northern Powerhouse rail link, promised in the manifesto then quietly shelved? 71. Although to be fair, he has cut corporation tax. 72. And inheritance tax. 73. And raised the basic rate income tax threshold to £11,000 from next year, with the higher rate also rising to £43,000. 74. And committed to a seven day a week NHS. 75. He has also stuck to his guns (unsurprisingly) on the Trade Union Reform Bill, which sets a 50% turnout threshold for strike ballots. 76. And he has banned legal highs. Or should that now be illegal highs? 77. Mr Cameron is not above nicking the best bits from other party's manifestos. He has abolished permanent non-dom status. If that sounds familiar, it is because Ed Miliband promised to do it if he got in power. 78. He successfully remembered to wish his favourite football team Aston Villa good luck before their FA Cup final clash - despite getting them confused with West Ham during the General Election campaign. 79. But he did not manage to turn up and cheer them on. Which is just as well, really, since they lost 4-0 to Arsenal. Cameron wished Aston Villa well in the FA Cup Final - but they lost 4-0 80. Mr Cameron came in for criticism for selling off RBS shares at what some considered too low a price. 81. He also controversially sold off shares in Royal Mail. 82. And told the BBC it needs to pick up the cost of free TV licenses, rather than the government. 83. David Cameron became ""mesmerised"" by colourful Kids Company founder Camila Batmanghelidjh. 84. So mesmerised that he gave the nod to a £3m cheque to her charity. 85. And then quickly became rather less mesmerised, when the charity shut down a week later amid claims of financial irregularity. 86. He has also watched on as the leaders of Labour, the Lib Dems and UKIP resigned. And then one of them unresigned. 87. He promised he would not gloat about Jeremy Corbyn 88. And even gave him some advice on how to win the contest. Mr Cameron told him he should copy his own tactics against David Davis - and position himself as the ""change candidate"". 89. But the PM managed to blank the girl who started the ""Milifandom"" during the election campaign. Abby Tomlinson wrote on Twitter: ""Help me. I think he knows who I am. He kept staring after I said hello."" 90. He has had a row with Sir John Chilcot about when the Iraq inquiry will be published... Cameron marked 100 days taking about his ""One Nation vision"" 91. And lost a Lord to drugs and prostitution. 92. Mr Cameron has announced a levy on large firms to pay for apprenticeships... 93. An 8% surcharge on bank profits... 94. And committed to spending 2% of GDP on defence for the rest of this Parliament. 95. He has axed student maintenance grants. 96. Ruled out a sugar tax. 97. And scrapped housing benefit for 18 to 21-year-olds. 98. Mr Cameron has also written an article about 100 days in government. 99. How is he marking it? By committing to more academies and saying the wants every school to have the opportunity to convert. 100. According to the PM himself: ""100 days in, we are showing it is a Conservative majority government which has the ideas to build the One Nation vision and to deliver real social mobility in our country."" In other words, he is trying to park his tanks on Labour's territory."

The road is closed in both directions, according to Transport for Greater Manchester - which is warning of delays and advising people to take alternative routes. The hole is at the eastern end of the road, between the junctions of the A6 London Road and Fairfield Street. It opened up after midday on Friday and a workman told the Manchester Evening News there were concerns it could spread to the other side of the carriageway. The city has been lashed by heavy rain today, and Mancunian Way was earlier closed due to flooding. The rain has also caused delays on the city's trains. In a statement, Manchester City Council said: ""Motorists should be aware that part of the Mancunian Way is currently closed in both directions due to a collapse in the road caused by the extremely wet weather. ""It is thought a culvert beneath the Mancunian Way has been eroded by the heavy rainfall which has caused the road above to be impacted. ""City council and United Utilities officers are currently at the scene to assess the situation. ""Depending on the extent of the issue the road may remain closed over the weekend. ""Traffic will be diverted via London Road, Fairfield Street, A665, Hyde Road and Downing Street."" Football fans heading to Manchester City's game against Chelsea on Sunday are being warned to check on the latest situation before they travel."

Mourinho broke his silence over his treatment of the doctor and team physio Jon Fearn after he was filmed shouting at them last weekend. He told a news conference he had a ""good relationship"" with the club's medical team and was well-known for praising them. Reports suggested he had banned Dr Carneiro and Fearn from the bench, training and the team hotel, following the game with Swansea. He was unhappy after they ran on the pitch to treat Eden Hazard who was injured - an act Mourinho said was ""impulsive and naive"". Jose Mourinho did not apologise for this treatment of the medics Footage shows Mourinho confronting the medics when they return to the technical area after treating Hazard. There is an exchange of words between Mourinho and Dr Carneiro, with the Portuguese animatedly pointing to the pitch and shouting.

Fearn follows Dr Carneiro a few seconds later but avoids eye contact with Mourinho, who is seen lambasting him while waving his arms theatrically. The physio does not respond. The manager told the media afterwards that their decision showed they did not ""understand the game"". He said Dr Carneiro's role at Chelsea was set to change significantly as a result. Speaking at a pre-match news conference today, Mourinho responded to those who criticised him over his treatment of the two medical staff. He confirmed both Dr Carneiro and Fearn would be absent from their usual roles on the bench at Manchester City's Etihad Stadium on Sunday. But he did not rule out their future return. ""Jon Fearn and Dr Carneiro will not be on the bench,"" he said. ""That does not mean that Sunday is for the rest of the season or their careers - they will not be on the bench on Sunday, that is clear, that is my responsibility,"" he added. The Premier League Doctors' Group has expressed its concern over the ongoing situation. The organisation said a reduction in Dr Carneiro's role would be ""unjust in the extreme"". But Mourinho defended his relationship with the team's medical staff and said that they should be allowed to have disagreements. He said: ""First of all I want to say I have a fantastic medical department led by Dr Paco Biosca, I have a good relationship with them. ""With more than a dozen professionals between doctors, physio, masseurs - I have a very good relationship with them. ""They tell me all the time that they were never praised as much as they were by me in the last two years. ""Normally when things go well managers keep it to themselves, I have praised them lots of times in the last couple of years and they don't forget that. ""They also told me that we have had disagreements during that period, we need disagreements to improve. ""We work together and we improve together, that is the way we do things. It is a relationship that is open to disagreement."" Dr Carneiro joined the club six years ago, working previously at the British Olympic Medical Institute and with England Women's Football. The doctor thanked people for their support on Facebook over the weekend. ""I would like to thank the general public for their overwhelming support. Really very much appreciated,"" she said. The post has attracted 40,000 likes."

Speaking to Sky News, the Bollywood composer, who has won international acclaim, said: ""There's a lot of history between India and England. (The decision) was a friendly notion. I've been working in England for 15 years…You have a great crowd here."" He said it was important to move forward from the colonial past and instead share positives like ""knowledge, wisdom, love and music"". Rahman's career, spanning 23 years, has seen him compose 100 soundtracks, sell 200 million albums and appear on Time Magazine's most influential people list.  His soundtrack to Danny Boyle's 2009 film Slumdog Millionaire earned him two Oscars, a BAFTA, a Golden Globe Award and two Grammys. Describing how difficult it would be to narrow his music down into one night, he said: ""It's a tough thing to do but I go with my instinct. Certain songs become iconic and part of the history of people's lives."" His fusion of eastern and western musical styles revolutionised the Indian film industry and thrust him onto the international stage. ""Music should be for all. I love western music, I love eastern music and I wanted my music to have the same philosophy. There's so many things we can share and it all requires connecting with small steps."""

Olympic long jump champion Greg Rutherford was the first to complain when he tweeted a picture of the kit's top and posted a comment alongside. He said:  ""Well this isn't right ... Where's the Union Jack!?!? @BritAthletics (this is the kit for worlds)."" Several present and former members of the British athletics team joined him in criticising the lack of the national flag. The top is similar in style to the one team members have been wearing in recent months, with a blue and white front, separated by a chevron, and red sides. But, unlike the one he wore in July, Rutherford's top shows the logo of British Athletics rather than the flag. Britain's Greg Rutherford competes in the Anniversary Games in July He added: ""I'm yet to find an athlete who wanted the change. EVERY athlete I've spoken to wants the Union flag. ""Most annoyingly about all this is that the kit itself is amazing! IMO the best kit to compete in material-wise. Just looks s***."" Paralympic 2012 quadruple gold medallist David Weir replied to Rutherford, adding: ""We all put the kit on for the flag. And I couldn't see any other country do it."" Steeplechaser Eilish McColgan said: ""It's unfair for athletes not supported by UKA to have to wear it ... Doesn't make any sense! Bring back the flag!"" Dame Kelly Holmes, a double Olympic champion at Athens in 2004, responded on Twitter: ""Totally agree. The Union Jack is iconic."" Shadow culture, media and sport secretary Chris Bryant lent his support, tweeting: ""Yes @GregJRutherford is right. That vest could easily be French or American. ""Where is the Union flag? Is someone embarrassed to be British?"" The full British kit posted on Instagram by athlete Cindy Ofili Rutherford pointed out that the 2012 London Olympics kit for Team GB - designed by Stella McCartney - featured a Union Jack flag prominently. British Athletics did not respond to the complaints directly but retweeted an Instagram post from hurdler Cindy Ofili, who said: ""Excited to have finally received my first full British Kit!! Thanks britishathletics"". The kit that she had laid out appeared to have several items that sported Union Jack flags. A spokesman later told Sky News: ""In regards to the new kit design, we would reassure athletes and fans that the Union Flag remains an integral part of the British Athletics team kit, and is included on the majority of items worn by the team, complemented by the words Great Britain across the chest. ""The inclusion of the British Athletics team name and logo is to help create a strong team identity for the British Athletics team. ""This follows the tradition of the vast majority of other Olympic sports, such as swimming and cycling, who have used their team name and logo on kit design for years, and creates a powerful team identity. ""This approach was also adopted very successfully by TeamGB when, in 2012, they replaced the traditional Union Flag with the TeamGB logo that resonated so strongly with the British public."" A total of 63 athletes are being sent to China for the World Athletics Championships, captained by 400m runner Martyn Rooney."

Paul Buchanan, who was being sought by West Mercia Police, was a target of Operation Captura and his face was among those displayed on a giant screen in a so-called rogues roadshow. The campaign, run by the National Crime Agency (NCA) and Crimestoppers, aims to trace ""most wanted"" fugitives suspected of carrying out crimes in Britain and who are thought to be on the run in Spain. His picture along with those of 17 other wanted men was flashed across a 13ft digital billboard attached to a van and driven through the expat hotspots of Benidorm, Malaga and Puerto Banus last month. Buchanan, who is originally from New York, was stopped at a train station in Lisbon with no ticket or identification and questioned by police. Buchanan's face was among those on a giant screen After giving his real name, officers matched him to his photo, said the NCA. He is due to appear in court in the city on Saturday. Buchanan is the second suspect to be arrested this month as part of Operation Captura, following the detention of Anthony Dennis. Dennis was wanted over allegations of drug trafficking abroad and for conspiring to import class A drugs. So far more than 68 out of 86 wanted individuals have been apprehended. Dave Allen, from the NCA, said: ""Recent work to publicise the outstanding subjects has brought the campaign to the attention of ex-pats and holiday makers alike, and continues to make life uncomfortable for fugitives looking to evade justice by fleeing abroad."" Lord Ashcroft, Crimestoppers chairman, said: ""It is fantastic to hear that there has been another arrest so soon after Anthony Dennis' capture. ""The list of fugitives wanted as part of Operation Captura gets smaller all the time and we will not stop until all of them have been brought to justice."""

Liverpool coroner Andre Rebello recorded a verdict of accidental death after reading out details to a hearing in the city. He said Cilla, who was 72, was a ""daughter of Liverpool"" and was celebrated by everyone there. Cilla's three sons - Ben, Robert and Jack - sat in court for the 15-minute hearing. Her son Robert wiped away tears and sighed as details of her death were read out in the court.  Gallery: 'Liverpool's Cinderella': City Mourns Cilla Black Liverpool is in mourning after the death of Cilla Black, who was born in the city in 1943 Addressing her sons, the coroner said: ""She was your mum and her death is a private personal matter and we have all got one mum. ""It is right that you grieve and remember her."" Mr Rebello continued: ""Far more important is that you celebrate her life, but your mum was far more than just your mum. ""She was a daughter of Liverpool and she was a celebrity and loved by all in Liverpool and that will be part of her abiding memory and memorial. ""But you will have personal, private memories of her as mum. ""It is those memories of the ordinary things she did, normal family events, the love shared and the love given, that must be her abiding memory, not just for this generation, but for each born in the future."" The coroner added that the investigation by Spanish authorities had been thorough. No witnesses were called at the hearing. The proceedings were postponed an hour before they were due to begin yesterday after it was realised the star's body was not in the city."

Dr Mario Villalba, director of the Red Cross hospital in Asuncion, told local radio the baby was delivered by caesarean section and was doing well. ""A baby girl, weighing 3.5kg (7lb 11oz), was born without any complications or anomalies,"" he said. ""The post-operative recovery is going very well."" The authorities' handling of the case sparked outrage in the overwhelmingly Catholic country, where abortion is illegal except when the mother's life is at risk. When the case came to light in May, the unnamed girl was 10 years old and 22 weeks pregnant. Gilberto Benitez Zarate has been charged with rape International humanitarian groups argued the girl's body was not able to support her pregnancy and her life was in danger. But the government, courts, the Catholic Church and other groups insisted the pregnancy should not be terminated, partly due to its advanced stage. After the birth, Erika Guevara, Amnesty's director for the Americas, said: ""Only time will tell the true extent of the physical and psychological consequences of her tragic ordeal. ""It is terrifying that her story will remain all too common unless Paraguay does more to protect victims of sexual violence, decriminalise abortion and guarantee the availability of modern contraceptives and access to information about sexual and reproductive rights."" The girl's 42-year-old stepfather, Gilberto Benitez Zarate, was arrested in May and is awaiting trial on rape charges. He faces 15 years in prison if convicted of rape. Zarate has denied the charges and claimed he had been set up by his girlfriend, the girl's mother. The girl's mother has been charged with negligence."

Police got a tip-off shortly after 7.35pm on Thursday that a woman's body was in a vehicle. A car matching the description was seen on Claybank Street at around 3.50pm on Friday. Officers followed it to River Street in Heywood, where it was found abandoned. Two men were arrested nearby and remain in custody on suspicion of murder. Claybank Street and other adjoining roads have been cordoned off. Tree surgeon Ryan Slack, 20, who lives in the area, told Sky News he witnessed the arrests. He said: ""I saw two police officers grab two guys, one had a back pack. ""I just thought it was drugs or he had a weapon or something. I didn’t think too much of it at the time. It’s shocking. It’s only a small town."" Other residents have been describing their shock at the discovery of the body. Debbie McDermott said: ""I don't want to let my daughter out of the house. It's scary. It's definitely too close to home that something like this can happen. Support worker Debbie Coulthurst, 46, said: ""I came home from work and all the police were on the street. ""I didn't hear what happened until about eight o' clock in the evening - that a woman's body had been found in the car. I just feel for the poor lady."" Police have yet to formally identify the young woman. A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said: ""The men remain in custody for questioning and enquiries are ongoing."""
2015-08-15,"Right up until publication, the Islamic State recruiters Sally Jones and Junaid Hussain kept in contact with the two fake identities we had created.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150815113448/http://news.sky.com/story/1533625/how-new-islamic-state-threat-was-uncovered,"By Stuart Ramsay, Chief Correspondent Right up until publication, the Islamic State recruiters Sally Jones and Junaid Hussain kept in contact with the two fake identities we had created. They were still hoping one of our characters, a girl, would attempt to assassinate the Queen and other members of the Royal Family with a pressure cooker bomb at this weekend's VJ commemorations. Over a four-month period we invented then developed our characters and employed a freelance investigative reporter to ""run"" the characters - one male and one female. Using these personas, we made contact with Islamic State recruiters initially using Twitter - then using anonymous online messaging services. It led us to a married couple - Junaid, or Abu, Hussain, and Sally Jones, known as Umm Hussain. They're both from Britain and living in Raqqa. Hussain, 21, is from Birmingham and is in charge of IS recruitment. He is also a former computer hacker and has the dubious honour of being in the top five of IS operatives most likely to be killed by an American drone. During the course of our initial contacts he realised he was talking to a female and suggested she talk to his wife. Jones - originally from Chatham in Kent - recruits women and girls from Britain. She sent a bomb-making manual to our female character via a secure-sharing site, telling us that she had another girl in Glasgow ready to attack. Specifically, she mentioned the Royal Family and the date of 15 August - the day of the VJ commemorations in London. She also told our character that two other girls had been recruited but had failed to carry out a promised attack. Security contacts have confirmed to us that the existence of these three potential bombers is a genuine concern. The key to running our characters has been to keep them ""real"". Our investigator and I would talk at length every day or at least every day there was contact and we would agree a line of questioning or response. Not asking too many questions and being apparently utterly committed to the jihadist cause was vital. Perhaps our most successful move was to buy up all the items needed to make a bomb and prove to Jones that we had bought them and that day. It was not difficult to do. A fact not lost on the authorities. We suspect that she was testing our commitment but it is likely it was a test of our status. If our characters were on a watch list and bought a pressure cooker we are pretty certain, as are the IS team, that we would have been lifted by the authorities. The revelation from Jones, true or otherwise, that she was handling another three would-be bombers was our cue to contact the authorities immediately. Sky News has always felt a moral obligation to do this, but there is quite simply a legal requirement to do so as well. It was never in doubt we would make the call as soon as we realised there was a genuine risk that we were talking to people actively involved in a real terror plot. The anti-terror officers met us and agreed we should continue our contacts with the IS people. With the cyber operation slowly bubbling along, I made contact with our sources in Syria and Turkey to see if there was more to support a second strand to this story that IS has changed its policy towards European and, particularly, British jihadists. No longer are they calling on ""Brothers and Sisters"" to come to their so-called caliphate in Syria and Iraq. Rather, they are insisting that they stay at home and plot with their help to blow themselves up or to kill people here. In Turkey, amid very, very high security concerns, we found our movements badly restricted. Turkish security took to following our movements as soon as we arrived in the city of Urfa, not far from the Syrian border. This is the route IS volunteers and defectors for that matter, pass through either going in or out. My meeting with a former IS internal security officer took place in a secret location I arrived at by foot, having lost our tail in the teeming streets of the city's ancient souk. His revelations that four or five British men have spent six weeks on a series of terror courses and have now returned to the UK on a ""mission"" has been passed to the authorities as well. It's impossible to know if any of this is true, of course. But we suspect much of it is. At the very least it indicates how determined IS are to strike in the UK and just how much work the authorities are faced with every day as they try to keep everyone safe."
2015-08-15,The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have released a strong warning to paparazzi to stop harassing their children.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150815113448/http://news.sky.com/story/1535714/palace-warns-paparazzi-stay-away-from-george,"By Rhiannon Mills, Royal Correspondent The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have released a strong warning to paparazzi to stop harassing their children. The communications secretary for Kensington Palace has written an open letter to the media, highlighting how Prince George and Princess Charlotte are increasingly under surveillance from unauthorised photographers. The letter praised British, Australian, Canadian and New Zealand media for respecting the family's privacy, adding: ""The Duke and Duchess are glad that leaders in the media industry share the view that every child, regardless of their future public role, deserves a safe, happy, and private childhood."" George arriving at hospital to visit his sister for the first time Thanking the public for messages of support, they also promised that official opportunities to photograph the children would become ""a regular occurrence"" as they grow older. The Metropolitan Police warned that photographers were at risk of being shot by armed officers if it was felt there was a safety or security risk to the royals.  The Duke and Duchess are still ""upset"" that ""a small number of paparazzi photographers"" are going to extreme lengths to satisfy a large international market for unauthorised photos of the children, however. They said long lenses had been used to capture images of the Duchess and Prince George in private parks and to monitor George, his nanny, household staff and visiting children. They said cars leaving the family's homes had been followed and other children had even been used to lure the young prince into the view of photographers while playing in playgrounds. The letter said that, like most parents, the couple enjoyed sharing photos of their children, but added that every parent would object to anyone - particularly strangers - taking photos of their children without permission. ""Every parent would understand their deep unease at only learning they had been followed and watched days later when photographs emerged,"" it added. The letter added that Prince George is currently that market's ""number one target"" and the decision had been made to ""discuss"" this as incidents became ""more frequent and the tactics more alarming"". One incident last week was described as ""disturbing but not at all uncommon"". A photographer had rented a car and parked in a discreet location outside a children's play area. Gallery: Duchess Of Cambridge's Pictures Of Her Little Prince And Princess The photos were taken by the Duchess of Cambridge in the middle of May Concealed by darkened windows, he also hung sheets inside the vehicle and created a hide stocked with food and drinks to get him through a full day of surveillance, waiting in hope to capture images of Prince George, the palace said. Police discovered him lying in the boot of the vehicle trying to take photos with a long lens through a small gap in his hide. The palace's letter added: ""It is of course upsetting that such tactics – reminiscent as they are of past surveillance by groups intent on doing more than capturing images – are being deployed to profit from the image of a two-year old boy. ""In a heightened security environment such tactics are a risk to all involved. The worry is that it will not always be possible to quickly distinguish between someone taking photos and someone intending to do more immediate harm."" Gallery: Prince George: William And Kate's First Child The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge released new photos of their son as he prepared to celebrate his second Christmas Kensington Palace has said that legal steps are being taken to safeguard the family but they hope the letter will encourage public debate and help publishers of unauthorised photos of the children to understand the power they hold to ""starve this disturbing activity of funding"". The Met Police said: ""At a time when the national security threat level from international terrorism is at severe, all officers are at a heightened level of readiness. ""Officers involved in the security of protected people are armed and have to constantly assess security risks. ""Photographers using covert tactics often come to the attention of armed officers who take steps to stop and verify the details of those who raise suspicions. Gallery: George's First Official Engagement Prince George shows he is growing up fast as he joins a baby playgroup for the first time while visiting Wellington, New Zealand. ""Photographers are potentially putting themselves at risk from armed intervention where our armed officers perceive a risk to the personal safety of their principal, the public and themselves."" Paddy Harverson, former communications secretary to the Royal family said the situation was ""palpably worse than in the 1980s"". ""There’s a lot more freelance paparazzi out there that don’t obey anyone's rules and I think there’s a media obsession with very young children and babies of the famous, the celebrity, in this case the royals, and therefore there’s a bigger market than there was back in the 80s,"" he said.  Sky News does not publish images of the Royal family taken by unauthorised photographers."

Ms Mueller, whose death was confirmed in February, is said to have been kept by Islamic State financier Abu Sayyaf and his wife, Umm Sayyaf.  According to a Yazidi teenager who was held with 26-year-old Ms Mueller, al Baghdadi took the American as his ""wife"", repeatedly forcing her to have sex when he visited. Abu Bakr al Baghdadi is said to have taken Ms Mueller as his 'wife' Mueller family spokeswoman Emily Lenzner told the Associated Press news agency the 14-year-old Yazidi girl, who later escaped, spoke to US officials. They checked out her story before passing it on in June to Kayla Mueller's parents, Carl and Marsha Mueller, Ms Lenzner added. An unnamed US official confirmed the account, which was first reported by The Independent. According to the newspaper, Ms Mueller was kept in a room with four Yazidi teenagers, whom she tried to protect from abuse by Umm Sayyaf and militants. The girls are said to have regarded Ms Mueller as a ""mother figure"". The American aid worker would leave the room when al Baghdadi visited and weep afterwards as she told the Yazidi girls about the sexual abuse she had suffered, reports the newspaper. Abu Sayyaf, a Tunisian, was killed in a US special forces raid on his Syrian compound in June, which American officials said reaped vital intelligence about IS. Umm Sayyaf, who was detained during the raid, is said to have co-operated with US interrogators and has been turned over to the Iraqi Kurds for trial. Ms Mueller, from Prescott, Arizona, was taken prisoner in Aleppo, Syria, in August 2013. IS said she died when Jordanian warplanes struck the building where she was being held, though they offered little proof for the claim. The Mueller family released a heart-wrenching letter she wrote to them from captivity in which she said she had been ""treated w/ the utmost respect + kindness"". ""Do not fear for me,"" she said in the letter, which is widely thought to have been written under duress."

His tearful wife, Deb Fogle, who wed him three months before his conviction, was waiting for him outside court and said she always believed he would be cleared. Lewis Fogle and wife Deb. File pic The Innocence Project, a group that works to exonerate wrongfully convicted people, had led calls for new DNA testing in the case. It said sperm evidence had ""excluded Fogle and pointed to an unidentified male"". ""This has been an extremely long journey for Mr Fogle, who has always maintained his innocence of the 1976 crime,"" said David Loftis, of the Innocence Project. District Attorney Patrick Dougherty conceded the conviction ought to be thrown out after agreeing to the new DNA test. But he told Reuters news agency he does not believe Fogle is wholly innocent of involvement in Miss Long's death. The prosecutor said he would decide by next month whether to retry Fogle. Fogle has been released on a bail bond as he remains charged. He was among four men arrested in 1981 after a mental health patient identified them under hypnosis as suspects. Fogle was convicted of second-degree murder based on the testimony of three jailhouse informants. Charges against his three co-defendants were dropped for lack of evidence. The district attorney said he would seek DNA from two of the other three men originally charged who are still alive."
2015-08-15,A pigeon smuggling cocaine and cannabis into a prison in Costa Rica has been caught by guards.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150815113448/http://news.sky.com/story/1535734/pigeon-caught-flying-drugs-into-prison,"A pigeon smuggling cocaine and cannabis into a prison in Costa Rica has been caught by guards. The bird was seen landing in the central concourse of the medium security La Reforma jail, in San Rafael de Alajuela, where it was taken into custody. The drugs were contained in a small zipped up pouch strapped to the animals chest. About 14g of cocaine and at least the same amount of cannabis were inside wrapped in plastic. Costa Rica's Ministry of Justice and Peace released the animal's mugshot under the headline caption ""narcopaloma"", meaning ""drugs dove"", and listing the date of the animals detention. Realidad7 reported the drugs had a street value of around £180 ($281). Prison officials said they believe the drugs were destined for use by an inmate who may have trained the pigeon to act as a courier. Director of the Penitentiary Police, Paul Bertozzi, told Spanish news agency Efe that it showed the need to be vigilant. ""Drug traffickers are using unimaginable ways to achieve their macabre atrocities,"" he said. ""This (use of a pigeon) is nothing new. In the past (the traffickers) have used cats and dogs to pass drugs to prisoners. Now it seems they are using pigeons to carry in their wares from the outside."" Although it is the first time the Costa Rican authorities said they had come across the practice, it has previously been reported in Argentina in 2013 and Colombia in 2011. The pigeon was later taken to a zoo where it was expected to remain behind the bars of a cage. Biologist Oscar Ramirez told Realidad7 that pigeons can be trained to travel several miles with small loads. During the Second World War, more than 250,000 homing pigeons were used to transport messages between front line Allied troops and top brass, according to the Royal Pigeon Racing Association."

Wearing a baseball cap, the 87-year-old peer was driven into a side entrance in the rear of a grey Toyota Avensis. During a court appearance that lasted less than two minutes, Lord Janner, who has dementia, appeared pale and frail, said Sky's Martin Brunt. Reporters waiting for Lord Janner at Westminster Magistrates' Court earlier Dressed in a green cardigan, blue t-shirt and navy trousers, he said ""Oooh, this is wonderful"" as he entered the courtroom and replied ""Yes"" when asked if he was Lord Janner. After he was read his charges, he was released on unconditional bail and was allowed to leave, following his daughter out. Gallery: Lord Janner In Court Lord Janner arrived at Westminster Magistrates' Court to attend a child sex abuse hearing Calling him ""daddy"", the woman said: ""We're going to go home and have an ice cream."" Lord Janner faces 22 charges relating to offences alleged to have taken place between the 1960s and the 1980s. The case was sent on to Southwark Crown Court, with the next hearing set for 1 September. Friday's hearing at a packed courtroom initially got under way without him, even though he had been ordered by a High Court to attend, leading the judge to threaten arrest. Much of the morning was taken up by his lawyers arguing that a court appearance would be too distressing for the peer. They sought to have him appear via video-link, citing his poor condition. Gallery: Lord Janner Has Spent Much Of His Life In The Public Eye Greville Janner was born on July 11, 1928 in Cardiff. He attended St Paul's School in London and during World War Two travelled to Canada as an evacuee. He went to school in Quebec But the argument was rejected by District Judge Emma Arbuthnot, who, amid the legal wrangling, appeared to lose patience. She told the defence lawyer to ""stop messing around"" and added: ""I'm warning you that as time progresses I'm going to turn to the prosecution and say, 'Lets get a warrant to have him arrested. Let's not waste time.'"" The peer, whose full title is Baron Janner of Braunstone, was a QC and then MP for Leicester West until his retirement from the House of Commons in 1997 when he joined the Lords. He has been on a leave of absence from the Lords since October 2014 as a result of his illness. Earlier this week, his lawyers had sought to prevent Lord Janner from having to attend the hearing, on grounds of his poor health and the risk of an injury. But High Court judges ruled on Wednesday that public interest outweighed any personal distress that might be caused to him."

The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) confirmed there had been an explosion at the back of the vehicle in the Palace Barracks in Holywood. The postal worker who had been driving the van was not inside when the blast took place. A fire broke out which then spread to two other vehicles and nearby garages within the complex. There were no reports of any injuries following the blaze but there was widespread damage to the van. Police have said they are working with the Royal Mail ""to mitigate any potential threat"" posed by parcel bombs.  Superintendent Karen Baxter from the PSNI said: ""Fortunately the postal worker who had been driving this van was not inside when the explosion occurred. The attack happened at the Palace Barracks in Holywood ""Although we have no information to suggest there may be other similar packages in the postal system we are working closely with Royal Mail to mitigate any potential risk."" Soldiers from The Royal Scots Borderers The Royal Regiment of Scotland have been stationed at the barracks since August 2014. The base, a few miles from Belfast, also houses the Northern Ireland headquarters of secret service MI5. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) Stormont Assembly member Alex Easton said: ""I am deeply angry and concerned that there has been an attempt to kill somebody or soldiers inside Palace Barracks. ""This is a very worrying development and I would totally and utterly condemn it. ""I am just relieved no one was seriously injured or killed and I would appeal to anyone who has any information to bring it to police to put those involved behind bars where they belong."" Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers said the attack was ""reckless"" Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers said the attack was ""reckless and futile"". She said: ""Those responsible for sending this postal device showed a reckless disregard for the safety of postal workers and others doing their jobs. ""There is nothing to gain from this."" In April 2010, a car bomb exploded outside the army base in an attack claimed by the Real IRA, a dissident republican organisation opposed to the peace process. In May this year, two bombs were discovered close to an army reserve base in Londonderry."

West Midlands Fire Service said one man was cut out of a vehicle and taken to hospital after the crash just before 11am. The road is expected to be closed until at least 5pm, with the Highways Agency warning travellers should use alternative routes or delay their journey. Long delays mean that queues are building on the M6 southbound from junction 10 (the M54 link) and on the M5 northbound, which is affected by the M6 closure at junction seven. Delays were also building on the M5 northbound from junction three towards the M6 link at junction eight. Among those affected will be fans travelling to tonight's match between Manchester United and Aston Villa in Birmingham, with both teams warning drivers to plan ahead and consider other routes."

NCA deputy director Graham Gardner said: ""This was an extremely significant seizure, the largest of its kind in the UK. Skorpion machine pistols ""I've no doubt that these weapons would have ended up in criminal hands and it goes without saying the risk they would have posed to the public. ""We are still in the early stages of a significant investigation which will continue for some time."" The six men and one woman appeared by video link at Medway Magistrates' Court.

2015-08-15,"This is the text of the open letter from Jason Knauf, the Duke of Duchess of Cambridge's
communications secretary, about ""harassment"" of Prince George:",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150815113448/http://news.sky.com/story/1535818/prince-george-pictures-warning-letter-in-full,"This is the text of the open letter from Jason Knauf, the Duke of Duchess of Cambridge's
communications secretary, about ""harassment"" of Prince George: I am writing to provide an overview of the current challenges facing Kensington Palace as we seek to protect Prince George and Princess Charlotte from harassment and surveillance by paparazzi photographers. I hope our experience will inform the ongoing effort to uphold standards on the protection of children in a rapidly changing media landscape. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have expressed their gratitude to British media organisations for their policy of not publishing unauthorised photos of their children. This stance, guided not just by their wishes as parents, but by the standards and codes of the industry as it relates to all children, is to be applauded. Gallery: Prince George: Birthday Boy's Top Moments This picture of George has been released ahead of his second birthday They are pleased also that almost all reputable publications throughout the Commonwealth - in particular Australia, Canada, and New Zealand - and in other major media markets like the United States have adopted a similar position. The Duke and Duchess are glad that leaders in the media industry share the view that every child, regardless of their future public role, deserves a safe, happy, and private childhood. And they have been delighted to share official photographs of Prince George and Princess Charlotte in recent months to thank the public for the thousands of kind messages of support they have received. News photographers have had several recent opportunities to take photos of the family and these will be a regular occurrence as both children get older. Despite this, paparazzi photographers are going to increasingly extreme lengths to observe and monitor Prince George's movements and covertly capture images of him to sell to the handful of international media titles still willing to pay for them. One recent incident - just last week - was disturbing, but not at all uncommon. A photographer rented a car and parked in a discreet location outside a children's play area. Already concealed by darkened windows, he took the added step of hanging sheets inside the vehicle and created a hide stocked with food and drinks to get him through a full day of surveillance, waiting in hope to capture images of Prince George. Police discovered him lying down in the boot of the vehicle attempting to shoot photos with a long lens through a small gap in his hide. It is of course upsetting that such tactics - reminiscent as they are of past surveillance by groups intent on doing more than capturing images - are being deployed to profit from the image of a two-year old boy. In a heightened security environment such tactics are a risk to all involved. The worry is that it will not always be possible to quickly distinguish between someone taking photos and someone intending to do more immediate harm. This incident was not an isolated one. In recent months photographers have: - on multiple occasions used long range lenses to capture images of The Duchess playing with Prince George in a number of private parks - monitored the movements of Prince George and his nanny around London parks and monitored the movements of other household staff - photographed the children of private individuals visiting the Duke and Duchess's home - pursued cars leaving family homes - used other children to draw Prince George into view around playgrounds - been found hiding on private property in fields and woodland locations around The Duke and Duchess's home in Norfolk - obscured themselves in sand dunes on a rural beach to take photos of Prince George playing with his grandmother Gallery: Duchess Of Cambridge's Pictures Of Her Little Prince And Princess The photos were taken by the Duchess of Cambridge in the middle of May - placed locations near the Middleton family home in Berkshire under steady surveillance It is clear that while paparazzi are always keen to capture images of any senior member of The Royal Family, Prince George is currently their number one target. We have made the decision to discuss these issues now as the incidents are becoming more frequent and the tactics more alarming. A line has been crossed and any further escalation in tactics would represent a very real security risk. All of this has left The Duke and Duchess concerned about their ability to provide a childhood for Prince George and Princess Charlotte that is free from harassment and surveillance. They know that almost all parents love to share photos of their children and they themselves enjoy doing so. But they know every parent would object to anyone - particularly strangers - taking photos of their children without their permission. Every parent would understand their deep unease at only learning they had been followed and watched days later when photographs emerged. The Duke and Duchess are of course very fortunate to have private homes where photographers cannot capture images of their children. But they feel strongly that both Prince George and Princess Charlotte should not grow up exclusively behind palace gates and in walled gardens.  Gallery: A Boat, A Bike And A Toy Camel Among Royal Gifts The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are presented with a mini Sealegs craft, a boat for Prince George, during their official tour to New Zealand They want both children to be free to play in public and semi-public spaces with other children without being photographed. In addition, the privacy of those other children and their families must also be preserved. Rest assured that we continue to take legal steps to manage these incidents as they occur. But we are aware that many people who read and enjoy the publications that fuel the market for unauthorised photos of children do not know about the unacceptable circumstances behind what are often lovely images. The use of these photos is usually dressed up with fun, positive language about the 'cute', 'adorable' photos and happy write ups about the family. We feel readers deserve to understand the tactics employed to obtain these pictures. We hope a public discussion of these issues will help all publishers of unauthorised photos of children to understand the power they hold to starve this disturbing activity of funding. I would welcome constructive conversations with any publisher or editor on these topics. And I would ask for your help as we work to encourage the highest standards on the protection of children in every corner of the media. The Duke and Duchess are determined to keep the issues around a small number of paparazzi photographers distinct and separate from the positive work of most newspapers, magazines, broadcasters, and web publishers around the world."
