2015-06-27,A woman has told how her fiance used his body as a shield and told her to save herself as the Tunisia beach massacre gunman fired at them.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150627071105/http://news.sky.com/story/1508958/tell-our-children-their-daddy-loves-them,"A woman has told how her fiance used his body as a shield and told her to save herself as the Tunisia beach massacre gunman fired at them. Sarah Wilson said Matthew James - who she lives with in Pontypridd, South Wales - was shot three times as he used his body to protect her. She said the gas engineer was hit in his shoulder, chest and hip on the sunbeds at Sousse beach, but was now recovering in hospital after suffering a heart attack and a shattered pelvis. ""He took a bullet for me. I owe him my life because he threw himself in front of me when the shooting started,"" she said. ""He was covered in blood from the shots but he just told me to run away. He told me: 'I love you babe. But just go - tell our children that their daddy loves them.' ""It was the bravest thing I've ever known. But I just had to leave him under the sunbed because the shooting just kept on coming. ""I ran back, past bodies on the beach to reach our hotel. It was chaos - there was a body in the hotel pool and it was just full of blood. ""You just can't explain how terrible it was. It was chaos with screaming and gunshots. I'm just so glad Matthew is alive because so many other people are dead."" The couple were among the first holidaymakers to speak of their horror after gunmen attacked a beach resort in Tunisia. At least 38 people have been killed in the attack, in the town of Sousse on the country's east coast. At least five of the dead have been confirmed as Britons. Amanda Roberts, from Swansea, said: ""We were on the nearby beach when the attack took place. We originally heard a muffled sound and saw police on horseback. ""Scuffles took place, people jumping over walls and there was a sound of gunfire. Someone said 'run for your life!' and we just concentrated on getting back to our hotel safely. ""Also, my family has sustained injuries to our feet. Luckily we were able to receive treatment from a doctor. We're feeling very shaken but at least we're still alive."" Steve Johnson, who is staying at the Imperial Marhaba hotel, said: ""We were just laying on the beach as usual ... and we heard what at first we thought was fireworks but it was soon pretty obvious that it was not fireworks, it was firearms being discharged, and people screaming and starting to run from along the beach towards us. ""Me and my friend said: 'That's guns, let's go' and we shouted to everybody around us who joined the sort of mass rush from the beach. People running in all directions around us."" He said the authorities were now ""removing a number of bodies from around the pool area"". Elizabeth O'Brien, from Dublin, said she grabbed her two sons and they ran for their lives when they heard gunfire coming from one of the hotels. ""We were on the beach, my sons were in the sea and I just got out of the sea,"" she said. ""It was about 12 o'clock and I just looked up about 500 metres from me and I saw a (hot air) balloon collapse down, then rapid firing, then I saw two of the people who were going to go up in the balloon start to run towards me - because I thought it was fireworks,"" she told Irish broadcaster RTE. ""So, I thought 'oh my God, it sounds like gunfire', so I just ran to the sea to my children and grabbed our things and as I was running towards the hotel, the waiters and the security on the beach started saying 'run, run run!' and we just ran to our room, which is like a little bungalow. ""So we are actually trapped in our room."" Ms O'Brien said the Irish consul in Madrid, Spain, called her to say it was a terrorist attack in the hotel next door and told her to stay where she was. ""My travel agent told me to go to the reception to speak to the rep, but I'm afraid. I'm stuck in the room with my two sons, not knowing what's going on,"" she said. Susan Rickett, who is staying at the Palm Marina Hotel, told Sky News: ""My sister was talking to someone who had seen some people shooting and had shot someone on a sun bed but we don't know if that's true. ""It sounded like a machine gun going off... and there was a kind of explosion a little bit later. ""They're saying it's going on in the hotel next to us. Police were chasing some men, that's all I know."" Gary Pine, who is staying at the El Mouradi Palm Marina hotel, said: ""My 22-year-old son had just gone back into the sea after a game of volleyball and then over to my left, about 100 yards away, we saw what we thought was firecrackers going off so we thought someone was celebrating. ""But you could see then quite quickly the panic that was starting to ensue from the next resort along from us, which is about 100 yards away, and so then people started exiting the beach pretty quickly, but only when you can start hearing bullets around your ears did you start to realise it was something more serious than firecrackers."" David Schofield, who heard an explosion while sunbathing by the pool, told Sky News: ""We heard people saying there were guns on the beach and people were shooting on the beach. ""I don't know what's going on. I went to reception and they said the police have told us to get everyone inside."" :: Watch Death On The Beach, a special Sky News report on Tunisia at 4.30pm, 6.30pm, 7.30pm and 9.30pm on Sunday on skynews.com, mobile, tablet, Sky go, or on TV: Sky 501, Virgin 602, Freesat 202, Freeview 132"
2015-06-27,Dozens of dogs have reportedly leapt to their deaths from a century-old bridge in Scotland in a mystery that has baffled animal experts.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150627071105/http://news.sky.com/story/1508864/dogs-die-after-jumping-from-suicide-bridge,"Dozens of dogs have reportedly leapt to their deaths from a century-old bridge in Scotland in a mystery that has baffled animal experts. Over the years, hundreds of canines have jumped from the 'suicide bridge' in West Dunbartonshire. According to the Daily Record newspaper, locals have put forward various theories to try to explain the strange phenomenon. Some say it is the work of a ""ghostly presence"" in the town, while others think the dogs are being lured by the strong scent of mink underneath the bridge. A sign now warns people that it is a ""dangerous bridge"", adding: ""Please keep your dogs on a lead."" One of the dogs to survive the fall is three-year-old Cassie. Her owner, Alice Trevorrow, has told the Daily Record that Cassie suddenly leapt from the 50ft high bridge for no apparent reason. She says the springer spaniel turned her head, looked up, and then jumped. ""I will never forget the awful whine she made as she leaped,"" she said. ""My son looked down and all he could see was a dot. She managed to get herself up and met my son, collapsing when she saw him. How she survived that, I'll never know."" Animal behaviourist Dr David Sands investigated the issue for Animal Planet and has offered an alternative explanation. He thinks the dogs, like humans, just wanted to peer over the edge of the bridge. ""I think it's highly likely... that it was curiosity that killed the dog,"" he said."

The V404 Cygni system sits 8,000 light years away from Earth in the Milky Way galaxy and is made up of a black hole and a star which orbit each other. Material flows from the star towards the black hole, where it gathers in a disc and heats up, before spiralling into the hole. Repeated bright flashes of light from the system have been seen in the past 10 days, something rarely seen in other black hole systems. When it flashes, it becomes the brightest object in the X-ray sky - up to 50 times brighter than the Crab Nebula, which is usually one of the brightest sources in the sky. The system is around 8,000 light years away in the Cygnus constellation The system has not been so bright and active since 1989, when it was observed with the Japanese X-ray satellite Ginga and instruments on the Mir space station. Erik Kuulkers, from the European Space Agency (ESA), which describes V404 Cygni as a ""monster black hole"", said: ""The community couldn't be more thrilled. ""Many of us weren't yet professional astronomers back then, and the instruments and facilities available at the time can't compare with the fleet of space telescopes and the vast network of ground-based observatories we can use today. ""It is definitely a 'once in a professional lifetime' opportunity."" A black hole is a region in space where gravity is so strong that not even light can escape. They are formed when a large star collapses in on itself."

According to the lawsuit, the family began receiving creepy messages from ""The Watcher"" three days after they had bought their new home in Westfield. It claims the previous owners of the house had also received letters from the stalker but failed to disclose it during the sale in the summer of 2014. The letters read: ""Why are you here? I will find out. My grandfather watched the house in the 1920s and my father watched in the 1960s. It is now my time. The couple never moved into the property because of the letters ""Do you need to fill the house with the young blood I requested? Once I know their names I will call to them and draw them to me. I asked the [prior owners] to bring me young blood. ""Have they found what is in the walls yet? In time they will. I am pleased to know your names and the names now of the young blood you have brought to me."" The letters also asked ""will the young bloods play in the basement?"" and asked to know ""who has the rooms facing the street?"" The family found the letters so disturbing, they never moved into the property, NJ.com reported. The lawsuit, filed at Superior Court in Elizabeth, reads: ""Upon information and belief, defendants suppressed all information regarding 'The Watcher' even though they were either on constructive or actual notice of the harm that could befall the plaintiffs and their minor children. ""Both [former owners] knew or should have known that 'peace of mind' and 'security' were and are of paramount importance to the plaintiffs, specifically and in general as is true to the high end market to whom defendants were marketing the home for sale."" Westfield Township Mayor Andrew Skibitsky told a public council hearing that an ""exhaustive investigation"" had been carried out into the threatening letters. No suspect has been identified and no charges have been filed in the case."
2015-06-27,A TV satellite engineer has been found guilty of stabbing his next-door neighbour 33 times after a long-running dispute which began over noise.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150627071105/http://news.sky.com/story/1508362/man-guilty-of-stabbing-neighbour-to-death,"A TV satellite engineer has been found guilty of stabbing his next-door neighbour 33 times after a long-running dispute which began over noise. Trevor Gibbon, armed with two knives, ambushed community safety campaigner Alison Morrison, 45, as she walked to the station on her way to work on 18 December. As she lay dying in the street near her northwest London home, mother-of-one Mrs Morrison repeatedly named her attacker. ""Trevor Gibbon did this to me,"" she told residents who had arrived to help her. Mrs Morrison - who was a key member of a neighbourhood safety campaign - died in hospital a short time later. The killer fled in his Mercedes but was picked up by police later the same morning in Lincolnshire, around 100 miles away. Gibbon - still with dried blood on his hands - told officers: ""It was over a neighbour dispute."" The 48-year-old denied murder, but admitted killing on the basis that he was ""suffering from an abnormality of mental functioning"" which impaired his ability to exercise self-control and form a rational judgement. Mrs Morrison's relatives wept in court after the Old Bailey jury found him guilty of murder. Gibbon killed her the day after he was handed a restraining order, having pleaded guilty to harassing Mrs Morrison and her family for years. The trouble between the neighbours started in 2011 shortly after Mrs Morrison, her husband Cedric and their son moved to their house in Windsor Crescent, Harrow, the court heard. Gibbon complained about the noise from the teenage boy's skateboard almost immediately after the family moved in next door, the jury was told. The Morrisons tried to placate him, but nothing seemed to satisfy him, the court was told. Gibbon, who lived with his partner, went on to harass and threaten Mrs Morrison, a senior manager at Which?. He trapped her in her car, banged dustbin lids loudly below their window early in the morning and repeatedly flashed his car lights, his trial was told. The jury was shown a statement Mrs Morrison had written in the days before her murder. ""It got so bad that I could not sleep properly as I felt it would never end,"" she wrote. ""He seemed to enjoy it, and whenever the police visited they would change their tactics and escalate what they were doing. ""The constant unending harassment despite police and council intervention was draining. ""Even now I don't believe he knows how to stop doing what he did and fully expect him to start again when he knows things have quietened down."" He was charged with harassing the Morrisons between 1 August 2012 and 31 October  2014 and admitted the offence on 17 December - the day before he stabbed Mrs Morrison. Giving evidence, Gibbon sobbed as he told the jury about the events leading up to the court case and Mrs Morrison's subsequent death. ""At that time it was tit-for-tat and up to that point that's how I saw it. If I did something, they did something back. They did something, I did something back,"" he said. Gibbon said he went ""hazy"" when he attacked Mrs Morrison. He said he could not remember what was running through his mind. ""I don't remember. I don't know what I was doing. I don't know what I was thinking,"" he said. Chief Crown Prosecutor for CPS London, Baljit Ubhey, described the killing as a ""shocking attack on a defenceless woman"". ""When he was later arrested Trevor Gibbon described himself as a coward, but today he has been found to be a pre-meditated murderer,"" he said. After her death, Harrow Council leader David Perry paid tribute to Mrs Morrison and the work she did to make the neighbourhood safer. ""Alison Morrison was passionately committed to creating a safer Harrow through her work with the Harrow Safer Neighbourhood Board and as a community champion, and it is terrible news that she has lost her life in this violent way in a borough she cared so much about,"" he said. ""Alison's colleagues on the Safer Neighbourhood Board are absolutely shattered by this news, as are the staff of Harrow Council. Alison was a key member of the board and a tireless advocate of its work."" Gibbon will be sentenced at a later date."

2015-06-27,"Actor Patrick Macnee, best known for playing agent John Steed in the TV series The Avengers, has died aged 93 in California.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150627071105/http://news.sky.com/story/1508501/avengers-star-patrick-macnee-dies-aged-93,"Actor Patrick Macnee, best known for playing agent John Steed in the TV series The Avengers, has died aged 93 in California. Macnee, who also guest-starred in dozens of British, American and Australian TV productions throughout his career as well as a James Bond film, died of natural causes at his home in California with his family at his bedside, according to his son, Rupert. Macnee appeared in The Avengers in the 60s with Ian Hendry, Honor Blackman, Diana Rigg and  Linda Thorson, and between 1976-77 in The New Avengers with Joanna Lumley and Gareth Hunt. He had lived in the US for the last 40 years, having taken American citizenship in the 1950s. A statement paying tribute to him on his website said: ""Patrick Macnee was a popular figure in the television industry. ""He was at home wherever in the world he found himself. ""He had a knack for making friends, and keeping them. With Diana Rigg as fellow secret agent Emma Peel ""Wherever he went, he left behind a trove of memories and good wishes."" Macnee, the son of a racehorse trainer, grew up in Berkshire and was educated at Summerfields Preparatory School, where he acted in Henry V opposite a young Sir Christopher Lee. He went on to Eton College, before training at London's Webber-Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art. Macnee turned his hand to acting after serving in the Royal Navy in the Second World War, working at the Windsor Repertory Theatre and in a number of minor film roles, before moving to Canada and the US. He found fame in the original Avengers series, playing Steed, the dapper British intelligence agent, throughout the original series from 1961 to 1969. Steed rarely used a gun in the series, a decision Macnee explained by saying he had seen enough violence during his war service, preferring to rely on brains rather than brawn - although his umbrella doubled as a sword. The Avengers was seen as having progressive views on feminism for its time. Steed's female partners tended to be independent and highly-educated women who were more likely to save the day themselves than act as damsels in distress. In an interview with The Lady magazine last year, Macnee said: ""The wonderful thing was it made women feel they didn't just belong in an apron in front of a stove cooking for the kids. ""It made them delight in the awareness that they could get out there and do it all, fight men, take on villains, all the kinds of stuff we showed in The Avengers. ""I'm very proud of what we achieved for women with The Avengers."" Macnee returned in the same role seven years later for The New Avengers, and appeared as the voice of Invisible Jones in the 1998 The Avengers film, which starred Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman. He also starred on Broadway in Anthony Shaffer's Sleuth, touring internationally with that play and several other productions. Macnee appeared in the 1985 James Bond film A View To A Kill with Sir Roger Moore. He played Bond ally and horse trainer Sir Godfrey Talbot.  Sir Roger said: ""So very sad to hear Pat MacNee has left us.  ""We were mates from 1950s and I have so many happy memories of working with him. A true gent."" His other films included cult heavy metal comedy This Is Spinal Tap and adventure film The Sea Wolves, alongside Moore, Gregory Peck and David Niven. He was married three times, including to actress Katherine Woodville, who appeared alongside him in The Avengers. He had two children, a son and a daughter, with his first wife Barbara Douglas, as well as one grandson."
2015-06-27,Rape conviction rates have fallen to 56.9%.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150627071105/http://news.sky.com/story/1508311/why-we-should-celebrate-rape-conviction-rates,"Rape conviction rates have fallen to 56.9%. As always, there is a world hidden beneath that simple statistic. The difficult decision to go to the police. Swabs taken, clothes tested. Reliving the attack numerous times – in the police interview room, in the court. Waiting for the verdict, to find the perpetrator has been found not guilty. Campaigners will be – rightly – concerned by the Crown Prosecution Service figures for 2014/15. Low conviction rates for rape, a crime notoriously difficult to prove, are a big worry for women's rights activists and the authorities should be held to account. Katie Russell of Rape Crisis said: ""The report highlights that we still have some distance to travel before all survivors of sexual violence and violence against women and girls receive the justice they want and deserve and there is no room for complacency."" But, sometimes, it’s also right to celebrate how far we have come. The conviction rate for rape may be falling, but more people are being found guilty than ever before. More cases are being brought to the courts in the first place – a total of 2,581. Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions, said the report was testament ""to the hard work we have done recently to encourage victims to come forward, to work better with the police and ensure specially trained prosecutors bring the right cases to court."" In total, some 107,104 cases concerning violence against women and girls were prosecuted during the timeframe, a rise of 18.3% on the previous year. The number of those convicted rose to its highest level at 78,773 - up 16.9% on the previous year. It's great news that victims are being taken seriously and more rape cases are getting into the court room. When a case comes down to one person's word against another, getting a conviction is always going to be difficult – and sometimes impossible. But at least the authorities are trying."

Senior detectives said they have arrested 20 people for a range of alleged offences, including money laundering, high-value theft and forced labour. Along with the 196mph supercar and ""substantial"" amount of cash, items including a Range Rover and a golf cart were confiscated by police. Chief superintendent Belinda Davies described the investigation - dubbed Purple Barracuda - as ""complex and sensitive"". ""Yesterday more than 250 officers executed a number of warrants at locations in Cardiff,"" she said. ""Suspected proceeds of crime ranging from luxury cars including a Ferrari and a Range Rover were seized along with a very substantial amount of cash ""One of the most critical elements was the protection of British and foreign nationals from forced labour and poor working conditions. ""Thirteen people who were found in various addresses were taken to a specialist reception centre where support is now being offered."" As part of the wider Operation Fulcrum, search warrants were executed at three locations across the Welsh capital - New House Farm, Shirenewton caravan site and a property in Newport Road, Rumney. Other alleged offences included the ""large scale abstraction of electricity"". Inspector James Dyson said the operation followed several months of planning and research. ""A police response such as this will no doubt have an impact on the traveller community within Cardiff and beyond,"" he said. ""With a view to this, there is an ongoing engagement process with Cardiff Council and the traveller community. ""The policing response was designed to reassure (people) that South Wales Police are there to represent and serve all, and will address any criminality and anti-social behaviour that exists."" No details on the age of the forced labour victims or where they are from have been released. Nor have the age or genders of those arrested."
2015-06-27,David Cameron's kickoff to EU renegotiation was just an interlude. A dinner palate cleanser.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150627071105/http://news.sky.com/story/1508782/camerons-eu-speech-was-palate-cleanser,"David Cameron's kickoff to EU renegotiation was just an interlude. A dinner palate cleanser. A useful break from a torrid, emotional and angry debate about the handling of the Mediterranean migrant crisis. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi accusing mainly Eastern European countries of ""time wasting"" of ""not deserving to be Europe"" and wrapping up with ""if this is your idea of Europe you can keep it"". The problem was the refusal of those countries to countenance the mandatory resettlement of 40,000 rescued migrants across the EU. The UK has an opt out, but an interest and an approach to the problem. The young Italian premier accused his fellow European leaders of ""lacking solidarity"". So Mr Cameron's brief contribution enabled EU Council negotiators to go away and redraft the communique on migration. For five minutes the PM spoke, he alone. It was brief, vague, and in the context, realistic. The President of the EU Council, Donald Tusk, agreed that it should host technical discussions on some of the UK concerns. He was the only council member to speak. The PM also repeated his view that any deal should be ""legally binding"" and ""irreversible"", but Number 10 admitted this would fall short of the full ratification of a new treaty by all members before a referendum. In other words, the public could end up seeing a change in the treaties, years after the referendum. It led both UKIP leader Nigel Farage to call the promise a ""post-dated cheque"" that could bounce. Labour said Mr Cameron's EU policy was ""a mess"". More happily for Mr Cameron, he has achieved the modest objective a starting renegotiations, and meeting every EU Council member within seven weeks of being re-elected. Significantly in the early hours of this morning, the Mr Tusk, for the first time, referred to the words ""UK renegotiation"" rather than referendum and reform. Also, Steve Baker, the MP who leads the Eurosceptic rebel group Conservatives for Britain, said his colleagues were ""realistic"" about the process of legal change. The telling point here is that even the EU's routemap for the Eurozone - the Five Presidents' report - does not envisage quick treaty change for an existential crisis of the single currency. That is a reflection of political reality. And if the member states cannot summon the political capital to do it to save the Eurozone, they will not do it to help Mr Cameron win a referendum that he chose for himself. The Five Presidents' Report itself was basically ignored at the summit, as the Eurozone focused on its near future. The crisis in Greece interfered and delayed proceedings at the summit, as finance minister talks broke down in a building next door. Yanis Varoufakis, Greece's finance minister, strolled over to the summit to brief his PM. EU leaders openly talked about preparing a Plan B for Grexit, which might involve bank holidays and capital controls by Monday. Another summit of Eurozone finance ministers will happen on Saturday, which makes the fourth meeting on that crisis this week. An immediate crisis of the single currency. And also on the shores of the Med, a test of the fundamental basis of solidarity within the EU. The Med crisis has posed questions about how much Italy and Greece will be helped with the humanitarian influx of migrants and refugees in boats. The furious and angry debate that sandwiched Mr Cameron's remarks on the UK raises question marks about the long term future of EU migration policy. An immediate crisis of the Schengen Area. One of Mr Cameron's aims is an opt-out from ""ever closer union"". Right now, with multiple crisis in its fundamental tenets around money and movement, the EU's members appear to be doing that all by themselves. The summit dinner could be a fundamental junction for the EU, with or without the UK."

A trial of the game saw volunteers complete four 10-minute online sessions while keeping food diaries. The volunteers reported losing almost 1.5lb (0.7kg) in a week. After six months, they had shed nearly 4.5lb (2kg). The ""stop-go"" game sees players press keys in response to images flashed on a computer screen, while obeying a signal not to respond to others. Images of nine foods - including biscuits, chocolate and crisps - fall into the ""stop"" category, while images of healthy foods elicit a ""go"" response. Other pictures of inedible items such as furniture and gardening tools could fall into either the ""stop"" or ""go"" bracket. The game tries to train people to associate high-calorie foods with the act of ""stopping"". Scientist Dr Natalia Lawrence, from the University of Exeter, said: ""These findings are among the first to suggest that a brief, simple computerised tool can change people's everyday eating behaviour. ""It is exciting to see the effects of our lab studies translate to the real world. ""This research is still in its infancy and the effects are modest - larger, registered trials with longer-term measures need to be conducted. ""However, our findings suggest that this cognitive training approach is worth pursuing. ""It is free, easy to do and 88% of our participants said they would be happy to keep doing it and would recommend it to a friend. ""This opens up exciting possibilities for new behaviour change interventions based on underlying psychological processes."" Results of the study have been published in the journal Appetite."

Even Scotland could see temperatures reach the mid-20s as intense heat from the continent pushes up over the Channel. But make the most of it, because it won't last long. Forecasters say that the high temperatures could last for just a couple of days before falling. Sky News weather producer Joanna Robinson said: ""There's lots of talk about the weather forecast for next week with the potential for our first spell of very high temperatures for this year, just in time for Wimbledon. ""In weather terms it's still a long way off and open to changes, but at the moment it looks like pressure will build early next week to bring mainly dry conditions and high temperatures. The hot weather could coincide with the start of Wimbledon ""A warm east or south-easterly flow is expected to develop by the middle of the week and temperatures could reach 30C (86F) in central or south-east England. ""It won't be quite as hot further north, but still very warm with temperatures in the low to mid-twenties. ""It looks to become humid as well, but the heat and humidity from the near continent could well bring the risk of thunderstorms to southern Britain by the end of the week."" Expect humid conditions if temperatures rise, and extreme heat if you're planning on travelling to some parts of Europe. A Met Office spokesman said: ""Very high temperatures are expected on the continent - Spain is likely to get into the 40s next week. ""That could rise up, giving us warm temperatures on Tuesday and Wednesday. ""There's a low probability along the south coast of temperatures in the high 20s and maybe even hitting 30 degrees. ""Even Scotland could see temperatures in the mid-20s. It'll be humid and sticky."""
2015-06-27,"Rare and valuable items held by libraries around the world are being ""raided"" by thieves, according to experts.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150627071105/http://news.sky.com/story/1508552/tome-raiders-rare-items-stolen-from-libraries,"By Richard Suchet, Sky News Reporter Rare and valuable items held by libraries around the world are being ""raided"" by thieves, according to experts. The theft of historically important books, manuscripts and maps has become such a serious problem that international experts are gathering in London to discuss how to tackle it. A conference at The British Library, called The Written Heritage of Mankind in Peril, aims to produce a set of principles that will ""help prevent widespread theft and trafficking and restore stolen items to their rightful owners for the benefit of everyone"". Art Recovery International, which keeps a database of missing cultural objects, says more than 2,000 rare items have been reported missing or stolen since the beginning of March. The company's chief executive Christopher Marinello said: ""We have seen thieves use small cutting tools - little knives disguised in pencils or pens. ""We have even seen them use wet string to remove a rare map or page from a book and then they will try to sell it on the open market place. ""Thieves have seen the phenomenal prices that rare books, manuscripts and maps have achieved at auction and are now raiding our libraries of some very important cultural heritage. ""Thieves are looking to cash out as quickly as possible and they are looking at libraries as a weak point. ""We hear about the fantastic art thefts that are taking place in museums - they often make the news - but very few people know about what is going on in our public libraries and that is why this conference is so important."" The conference is the first of its kind and will be attended by dealers, auction houses, law enforcement officials, security experts, lawyers, collectors, national collections and others. Tens of thousands of historic books and manuscripts are thought to be missing or damaged. ""These are not things that can be replicated,"" says Jonathan Eyal from the Royal United Services Institute. The Defence and Security Forum has had rare military and regimental books stolen from its own library. ""The particular damage from any pilfering is very specific,"" Mr Eyal said. ""These are very specialised collections of books, which take centuries to assemble and five minutes to destroy. The significance of such a loss is incalculable. ""One of the key problems for libraries is less that of security - most special collections are quite good at the physical security - it's more a question of betrayal of trust by employees."" One solution could be to digitise the rarest and most valuable books so they would be both accessible and secure, but opponents of the idea say it detracts from the principle of libraries being a public resource. Speakers at The British Library conference will include Jerker Ryden, legal adviser to the Swedish library, which was at the centre of one of the world's most famous thefts. Senior librarian Anders Burius stole at least 56 books in the 1990s. He later committed suicide following his confession and arrest in 2004. It is also thought there are thousands of items belonging to The British Library that are missing, lost or have been stolen."

It is the first time Her Majesty has visited such a site and it comes 70 years after Bergen-Belsen was liberated by British troops. Now a place of remembrance, there are no visible signs of what the camp once was. A memorial stone at Bergen-Belsen After it was liberated it was burnt to the ground to stop the spread of disease. It is estimated some 200,000 people were taken there during the Second World War and around 52,000 died. On 15 April 1945, when it was liberated by British and Commonwealth troops, some 10,000 bodies were found and thousands more were starving. Speaking ahead of the Queen's visit, Karen Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust, said: ""I think for many Holocaust survivors and particularly British Holocaust survivors, to see the Queen visit Belsen to lay a wreath at one of the memorials, it sends a really strong signal that this is an important event in history that we should remember. ""I think that it means a huge deal to the survivors and, well, to all of us who care about Holocaust education and remembrance."" Jewish teenager Anne Frank, whose diaries were published after the war, was among those who died at Belsen, along with her sister. The royal couple paid tribute to them and the thousands of other victims. They also met some of those who survived and soldiers who liberated the camp. After the pomp and excitement that has welcomed them in Berlin and Frankfurt over the past few days, the Queen wanted today's events to be more personal and reflective. Gallery: Queen Elizabeth And Prince Philip Making State Visit To Berlin German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Queen Elizabeth smile as a robot waves at them during their visit at the Technical University of Berlin in Germany Writing about the visit for The Daily Telegraph, the chief rabbi of the UK, Ephraim Mirvis, highlighted the persecution still faced by Jewish people. ""In recent years, the Jewish community has been faced with newer and different types of hatred,"" he wrote. ""Recorded incidents of anti-Semitism have reached worrying levels and we have witnessed appalling, murderous attacks on Jewish targets around Europe. ""The Queen is herself of the generation which uncovered the Holocaust and had to come to terms over time with its scale and inhumanity. ""That makes today's gesture of solidarity and remembrance all the more relevant and appreciated."""

Terrified sunbathers ran for their lives as the attacker, dressed in shorts and hiding his Kalashnikov inside an umbrella, opened fire on the beach in Port el Kantaoui on the outskirts of Sousse, Tunisia. He then entered the Imperial Marhaba hotel through the swimming pool area, shooting people as he went and also threw an explosive, witnesses said. Lorna Carty was among those killed in the Tunisia attack Tourists in the sea and on the sand ran and barricaded themselves in their hotel rooms after gunfire erupted, while medics used sunloungers to carry victims still in their swimming costumes. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond confirmed at least five Britons had died and warned the number could rise. He said a ""high proportion"" of the casualties were expected to be British ""because of the nature of the resort"". Irish mother-of-two Lorna Carty, from Robinstown, Co Meath, was also killed. Family friends said she had taken her husband on holiday to help him recover from heart surgery. And the nurse, who was aged in her 50s, was believed to have gone to the beach by herself when the gunman went on the rampage. Tunisia's health ministry said British, German, Belgian and Tunisian nationals were among the dead. At least 36 people were injured in the assault, which happened just hours after a man was decapitated by an attacker brandishing Islamist flags at a French factory. The US State Department said there was no evidence the atrocities were co-ordinated. Earlier this week, Islamic State (IS) called on its supporters to increase attacks during Ramadan and ""be keen on waging invasion in this eminent month and commit martyrdom"". The gunman in Tunisia was a young student from the city of Kairouan who was reportedly unknown to authorities. He was later shot dead by police. Twitter accounts that support IS released three photos of someone they said was the gunman. Speaking about how the country's worst attack in recent history unfolded, Tunisian security official Rafik Chelli said the gunman ""had a parasol (umbrella) in his hand"". ""He went down to put it in the sand and then he took out his Kalashnikov and began shooting wildly."" A photo has emerged of a dead man wearing black shorts, face down in the street with an automatic weapon next to him and surrounded by police. The interior ministry had previously said two attackers were involved, including one who had fled the scene. Local radio said police captured a second gunman, but officials did not confirm the arrest or his role in the attack. British tourists have been describing what happened. Gary Pine said: ""We thought fire crackers were going off but you could see quite quickly what was going on. Gallery: Deadly Shootings In Tunisia A bloodied quiz book and sandals lie in the sand after an attack on a beach that left dozens killed, including five Britons and an Irish woman, and dozens of others hurt ""There was a mass exodus off the beach. My son was in the sea at the time and myself and my wife were shouting at him to get out and as he ran up he said I’ve just saw someone get shot. Holidaymaker Susan Ricketts said: ""It sounded like a machine gun going off. There are people crying and going hysterical. We just came up to our room."" Another tourist John Yeoman, who barricaded himself inside his hotel room using a bed and chair, said: ""People are running around the hotel. No-one has really been told what to do."" Prime Minister David Cameron said: ""The people who do this do it in the name of a twisted perverted ideology."" A British embassy crisis team is being sent to Tunisia after a COBRA meeting took place to co-ordinate a response. Travel companies have offered tourists the chance to change their holiday bookings to Tunisia in light of the attack. Thomas Cook said customers due to travel between Friday and Sunday can cancel their holidays free of charge, while those flying out from Monday up to July 24 can amend bookings for holidays to Tunisia free of charge. People booked through Monarch or Cosmos Holidays in the next seven days can also choose not to travel and instead change their destination. Tui, which runs Thomson and First Choice, could not confirm whether it operated tours through the hotel. Back in March Sky's Sherine Tadros reported that the bulk of foreign fighters who have joined the ranks of IS come from Tunisia. Meanwhile, deadly explosions have hit a Shiite mosque in Kuwait's capital after Friday prayers. Dozens of people were killed and many others wounded in the attack. Following the day of violence, British police are putting extra security measures in place for events this weekend, including Armed Forces Day and Pride London. :: The Foreign Office says that anyone concerned about friends or relatives in Tunisia should call their switchboard on 020 7008 1500"
2015-06-27,"Major rail schemes have been plunged into chaos after the firm responsible for the track said it had been ""overly optimistic"" about achieving a five-year £38bn improvement plan.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150627071105/http://news.sky.com/story/1508314/rail-improvement-plans-thrown-into-disarray,"Major rail schemes have been plunged into chaos after the firm responsible for the track said it had been ""overly optimistic"" about achieving a five-year £38bn improvement plan. The Network Rail boss has apologised to passengers as he admitted the cost of the work now outstripped the available budget, leading to projects being put on hold. Other schemes also now hang in the balance with a review of around a fifth of the company's overall spending plans. Patrick McLoughlin said the firm's performance had 'not been good enough' Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin has said the plan was being ""reset"" because it was ""costing more and taking longer"". He told MPs electrification work was being ""paused"" on the Midland mainline and on the Transpennine route between Leeds and Manchester. The admission will come as a blow to the Transport Secretary, who has already been embarrassed by the debacle over rail franchises. He said the challenges facing NR ""could and should have been foreseen"" and in parts of its improvement programme the company's performance had ""not been good enough"". In a sign of his irritation, the Secretary of State revealed there was to be an overhaul of the NR management team with chairman Richard Parry-Jones being replaced by London's Transport Commissioner Sir Peter Hendy. None of NR's executive directors would receive a bonus for the past year, he added. Meanwhile, former Eurostar chief Richard Brown, who oversaw a recent review of rail franchises, will be brought in as a special director of NR to update Mr McLoughlin on the company's progress. And economist Dame Collete Bowe has been asked ""to look at the lessons learned"". Mr McLoughlin's statement came after NR chief executive Mark Carne said: ""During my first year in the job I have looked closely at every aspect of our business and it has become clear that Network Rail signed up to highly ambitious five-year targets set by the regulator. ""Based on historic improvements from a low base, we were overly optimistic about the capacity of our company and our supplier base to step up several gears in order to achieve the plan, especially given the complexities of a network that is at full capacity much of the time."" Mr Carne added: ""On the big items like electrification and capital projects, it was always part of the regulatory process that the costs and programme would be revisited as projects became properly defined. ""Unfortunately when these reviews have occurred, the more detailed project costs have been higher than assumed at the earliest stages of definition. ""As a result, the total enhancement programme cost now exceeds the available five-year budget. Some projects are also delayed beyond the original dates."" Mr Carne went on: ""I recognise that these delays will cause disappointment for some passengers for which I can only apologise."" Mr McLoughlin said much of the work needed on the railway should have been done decades ago and that successive governments had failed to invest. He said NR's spending should stay within its funding allowance, that electrification of the Great Western line was a top priority and that better services could be delivered on the Midland mainline before electrification. A spokesman for NR said about £2bn worth of projects had been paused and about 20% of the company's overall expenditure plans were being reviewed. He added: ""The vast majority of our work and hundreds and hundreds of projects across the country to improve and expand the railway continue."""

The Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains (ICLVR) said a dig on the farmland in Coghalstown, Co Meath, as part of the search for the remains of former monk Joe Lynskey, unearthed one body in the morning. A second body was discovered as further examinations took place at the site and preparations were made to take the first body out of the ground. Joe Lynskey IRA victims Seamus Wright and Kevin McKee are believed to be buried in the same area, the ICLVR said. ""We have always said that we think three bodies are in that area and until there is further identification we just don't know,"" a spokesman said. Gallery: Northern Ireland's 'Disappeared' A list of Northern Ireland's ""Disappeared"", the 16 people abducted and killed by Republican paramilitaries during the Troubles. Here, Robert Nairac talks to some children It is understood the second set of human remains was unearthed as specialists cleared ground around the first body to prepare it for removal. State Pathologist Marie Cassidy was at the site for a number of hours. Joe Lynskey's family, who have suffered a 43-year wait to give him a proper burial, were notified of the initial discovery and were said to be shocked but relieved at the discovery. The former Cistercian monk was abducted and murdered by the IRA in August 1972, but the terror group only admitted his disappearance in 2010. Mr Wright, another of the disappeared believed to be dumped in the bogland, was also from Belfast. He was in the IRA and was killed in the same year by his former colleagues, who accused him of being a British Army agent and a member of the Military Reaction Force. Sinn Fein Gerry Adams said he welcomed the discoveries. ""The uncertainty over who has been recovered must be hugely traumatic for the families involved,"" he said. ""I am sure that the Commission will move as speedily as it can to verify the identity of those who have been found. ""I thank everyone who has helped in the search of the remains of those who were killed and secretly buried by the IRA. Republicans have co-operated fully with the Commission and we now need to continue to do our utmost to bring closure for the remaining families. ""Today's discovery is an important step toward the recovery of all of those killed and secretly buried. ""I want to appeal again for anyone with any information on those remains still not found to bring that information forward to the families, to the Commission or myself. ""Any information passed to the Commission cannot be used in a court of law or transmitted to any other agency and those passing on this information have absolute immunity in relation to this information.”"

Shabani, an 18-year-old silverback, has been compared to a ""male model"", and has become the star attraction at Higashiyama Zoo in Nagoya. The ape, who weighs in at 180kg (400lbs), has been variously described as having ""brooding good looks"", ""rippling muscles"" and being ""very attractive"". Women are apparently so smitten by his looks that they have taken to social media to swoon and, according to the zoo, are flocking to his pen to take a peak. ""He often rests his chin on his hands and looks intently at you,"" zoo spokesman Takayuki Ishikawa told the AFP news agency. ""He is more buff than most gorillas and he's at his peak physically. We've seen a rise in the number of female visitors - women say he's very good-looking."" Shabani, who has been at the zoo since 2007, shot to fame after being made the campaign model for the zoo's spring festival earlier this year. Mr Ishikawa says the ape's paternal skills are also a big hit with women. ""He's a father and he always protects and looks over his children,"" he said. ""Zoo-goers think his kindness is attractive too."" Women have posted comments on social media, describing him as ""ikemen"" - or a hunk - and likening him to a male model. A recent flurry of tweets has made Shabani a national celebrity, with Japan's broadcasters NHK and NTV featuring the gorilla on popular shows. ""He will look you in the eye and sometimes if you're taking photos it will look like he's posing for you like a model,"" said Mr Ishikawa. ""But he's the head of a group of five gorillas so it's likely he's just watching out for them and keeping an eye on you."""

The victim's severed head had Arabic writing scrawled across it and was found on a fence next to two jihadi banners at the premises in Saint-Quentin-Fallavier in southeastern France. Yassin Salhi, 35, drove a delivery van into gas canisters at the factory, triggering the explosion, prosecutors said. He was apprehended at the scene by a firefighter. Prosecutors said it is still unclear as to whether there was an accomplice.   His sister, wife and one other individual have since been arrested.  Salhi, a father-of-three, worked for the 55-year-old victim, who was in charge of a local delivery company. The attack happened shortly before a gunman killed tourists, including Britons, at a Tunisian resort popular and a mosque was blown up in Kuwait. Security has been stepped up at the site of the attack Before she was arrested, Salhi's wife told radio station Europe 1: ""We are Muslim. We observe Ramadan...We have three children. We live a normal life.""   Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, speaking from the scene about 35km (22 miles) away from Lyon, described the attack as ""barbarous"" and a ""terrible terrorist crime"". Gallery: Arrests After Terror Attack In France Masked police escort the suspect's wife from a block of flats in Saint-Priest in eastern France following a terror attack He said Salhi, who did not have a criminal record, had been known to foreign intelligence services and may have been radicalised. :: Triple Terror Attacks: What You Need To Know The suspect, who lives in Lyon, was initially flagged as an extremist in 2006 and then police monitoring dropped off two years later, according to Mr Cazeneuve.  Describing the attacks, which were partly caught on CCTV, prosecutor Francois Molins said a delivery van routinely entered the factory premises at 9.28am local time.    A minute before the explosion, at 9.36am, CCTV captured the van being driven towards an open building, which housed cannisters of gas and liquid. Mr Molins said after firemen arrived at the scene, the driver was found in another building ""while he was trying to open cannisters of acetone"". The victim's decapitated body and a knife were found near the van. The head of the victim, not seen by the camera, was found on a fence with two Islamist flags. Mr Molins said: ""We are looking at an attempt of murder and murder and an endeavour of a terrorist attack."" Employees at US-owned factory Air Products, based in Allentown, Pennsylvania, are said to be ""very shocked"".   A statement from the company read: ""Our priority at this stage is to take care of our employees, who have been evacuated from the site and all accounted for. ""Our crisis and emergency response teams have been activated and are working closely with all relevant authorities."" Mr Hollande has cut short all of his engagements at the EU summit in Belgium to return to France for emergency talks. He said the security level in the region of Rhone-Alpes has been raised to ""attack"" for the next three days.  ""The attack was of a terrorist nature since a body was discovered, decapitated and with inscriptions,"" Mr Hollande told a news conference in Brussels. He added that a considerable police force had been deployed in the region and other industrial sites protected to avoid any further incidents. David Cameron has spoken to Mr Hollande in Brussels to express his sympathies at what Downing Street called an ""appalling"" attack. A White House spokesman said US law enforcement officials were in touch with their French counterparts. It comes nearly six months after the Islamist attacks in and around Paris that killed 17 people in January, including the shooting at satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo."
