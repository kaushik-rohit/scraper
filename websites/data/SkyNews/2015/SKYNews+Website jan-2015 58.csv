2015-01-07,The 2015 general election is on a knife edge.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150107093400/http://news.sky.com/story/1401981/2015-general-election-voting-wide-open,"By Michael Thrasher, Sky's Election Analyst The 2015 general election is on a knife edge. Growing support for UKIP, the Greens and the Scottish Nationalists is challenging the Westminster establishment. Voters are disillusioned with and disconnected from traditional patterns of party politics. Party leaders alienate more than they inspire. The market for votes is wide open. The standard method for predicting elections uses national swing - what happens in one constituency happens in all. This was not true, of course; there are always constituencies that defy the national mood. But the forecast errors tended to cancel out one another. :: Click here for Sky's In The Margins console In the current polling the combined support for Conservative and Labour is at its lowest level. One in three of votes to be cast next May is up for grabs. In this respect, little has changed over the past five years when the Conservatives polled 37% and fell 20 seats short of an overall majority and Labour with 30% posted one of its worst results. But what makes the 2015 election so intriguing is what is happening to other parts of the electoral landscape. Having secured one in four votes in 2010 the Liberal Democrats may win only one in eight this time. Fewer than a million voters supported UKIP candidates in 2010 but it is likely that four million will do so in 2015. The Green vote may be five times larger than previously. The effect of this upon the distribution of seats is uncertain. There will be fewer Liberal Democrat MPs in the next parliament but how far down the list of marginal seats will the cut mark fall? For every Lib Dem seat being targeted by Labour there are two that are vulnerable to the Conservatives. In the Margins shows a broad range of seats but it is likely that they will not fall in a smooth and orderly fashion.  Although UKIP is the new third party of choice it will not prove as electorally successful as the Liberal Democrats. And the last election is no guide to the next for Nigel Farage's party as the wins in Clacton and Rochester and Strood demonstrate. Correspondingly, Sky's choice of UKIP target seats is informed by votes cast in local and European elections over the past two years and, importantly, the personalities of the runners and riders in each constituency. The betting market currently favours about five wins. The selection of Norwich South and Bristol West as prospects for the Greens is again based on how voters have acted since the last general election. The first priority, however, is to defend Brighton Pavilion where Labour threatens. The aftermath of the Scottish referendum continues. Promises of further devolution are raising questions about the Westminster Parliament. Of immediate importance is the newly acquired support for the SNP and its impact upon Labour. Having spent time planning its attack upon Conservative and Liberal Democrats seats across England, Labour is transferring vital resources to defend the threat in Scotland. Dundee's two constituencies are ones to watch. Only Conservative and Labour have any chance of securing an overall majority but probably neither will succeed. The battle, therefore, is about which of the two becomes the largest party.  The large group of non-aligned voters brings risks for party activists defending territory or seeking to gain new ground. The Conservative/Labour fight for the marginal constituencies is made uncertain by the shifting tides of electoral opinion. In a close race the result in a large number of marginal seats will be determined by the effectiveness of local constituency campaigning."
2015-01-07,"Up to a million people in Britain could be illicitly using steroids on a regular basis, a Sky News investigation has found.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150107093400/http://news.sky.com/story/1403431/one-million-britons-may-use-steroids-regularly,"By Paul Kelso, Sports Correspondent Up to a million people in Britain could be illicitly using steroids on a regular basis, a Sky News investigation has found. Police officers and children as young as 13 are among the rising number of people using steroids and other performance enhancing drugs.  Interviews with drug workers, current and former users and academics reveal that steroid use has moved from the sub-culture of muscle gyms to the mainstream, with young men seeking a chemical shortcut to hone their physique. The increase in the number of users has led to concerns about the long-term health risks of substances that promote muscle growth, but can cause organ damage and lead to psychological problems. The use of injectable steroids also carries a risk of infection from blood-borne diseases, with steroid users who share needles vulnerable to HIV and hepatitis. Public Health England (PHE) told Sky News more needs to be done to combat the issue. ""More does need to be done, this is a growing issue, there are significant health harms associated with steroids,"" said Peter Burkinshaw of PHE. Drug workers across the UK report a huge rise in the number of steroid users taking advantage of needle exchange services, where they now outnumber all other drug users combined. There are no nationwide statistics for the number of steroid users, but informed estimates based on the evidence of local drug services put the number possibly as high as one million. Home Office figures relating to seizures bear out the evidence on the ground of a sharp rise in the number of young men turning to drugs to help them hone their physique. Individual seizures of steroids and other PIEDs increased by 35% in 2014 compared to the previous year, while the total number of doses rose by 70%, up from 1.5 million doses to 2.5 million doses. Drug workers in sites across England said that pressure to conform to a highly-defined body type was a factor in the increase, and said they were aware of children as young as 13 using the drugs. ""It's all to look good on a Friday night, and it is predominantly 15 to 25 year-olds,"" said Joseph Keane, who runs The Bridge drugs project in Bradford. ""I have had a 15 year-old injecting steroids straight into his chest, and I have heard anecdotally of guys as young as 13. ""That is the sort of pressure that is on them to look good from a young age."" At needle exchanges run by the Open Road project in Basildon, Essex, they are aware of police and forces staff who use the drugs. ""There are certain jobs that attract users, army, doormen, police,"" said Gill Hurford. ""They are people who feel they need to be fitting for the role. It could be anyone, it could be you. ""It's anyone who doesn't feel happy with the way they look."" A former police officer who used steroids, and left the force when he faced disciplinary charges, told Sky News he felt super-human when he was using the drugs. ""I'm a police officer and I look like a comic book hero, and I'm in a costume. Nine times out of 10 my sheer presence alone was enough to defuse a situation,"" he said. ""I will still say, and I won't regret saying this, it made me better at my job. That's why people take it. It's a performance enhancing substance."" His drug use came at a price to his health however. ""My liver was inflamed, that was as a result of taking oral steroids because your liver has to deal with the toxins. ""The left ventricle in my heart was enlarged... and my thyroid was on the verge of packing up."" Steroids are a Class C prohibited substance, meaning possession is not illegal, and up to £5,000 of the drugs can be imported without breaking the law."
2015-01-07,"A doctor raped and molested his patients at the same hospital where Jimmy Savile attacked sick girls, a court has been told.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150107093400/http://news.sky.com/story/1403144/hospital-consultant-on-trial-for-sex-offences,"By Martin Brunt, Crime Correspondent A doctor raped and molested his patients at the same hospital where Jimmy Savile attacked sick girls, a court has been told. Disgraced consultant paediatrician Michael Salmon, 79, ordered parents out of his consulting room so he could assault their daughters, the jury heard. The prosecution said he arranged abortions for two of his victims, even raping one after the operation. The offences allegedly took place at the hospital in the 70s and 80s Prosecutor Miranda Moore QC told the jury: ""This defendant took advantage of his status to molest these young females, some of them little more than children. ""They didn't know what was happening to them, they felt they could not complain. He was the doctor and their parents had taken them to see him."" She said Salmon, 79, had been struck off the medical register in 1991 after being jailed when he admitted indecently assaulting three young patients in his care. In a new trial he denies 16 charges against eight young girls, who were aged between 11 and 17 at the time of the alleged offences in the 1970s and 80s. The offences were committed at various hospitals, including Stoke Mandeville in Buckinghamshire, said Ms Moore. No victim reported it to police at the time, but one came forward during the investigation into the wide-ranging paedophile crimes of the late BBC presenter Jimmy Savile. ""Mr Savile will hardly feature at all in this case,"" said Ms Moore. ""There may be passing reference, but there is no suggestion he abused her at the same time as Savile. This happened when those other things were happening."" The prosecutor said the investigation into Salmon stemmed from Operation Yewtree, the police probe into Savile, but it was a separate case. Ms Moore said Salmon was no longer a doctor as he was struck off the medical register in 1991 after admitting three cases of indecently assaulting patients at the hospital. The trial continues."
2015-01-07,Prince Andrew has strongly denied allegations he had sex with an underage girl.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150107093400/http://news.sky.com/story/1402834/prince-andrew-sex-claims-whos-who,"Prince Andrew has strongly denied allegations he had sex with an underage girl. The claims were made in court papers in the US, as part of a lawsuit in connection with American billionaire and convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein - a former friend of the Duke of York. Sky News takes a look at the people involved in the story. :: Jeffrey Epstein Epstein was jailed in 2008 for soliciting a minor for prostitution The disgraced billionaire financier is accused of providing underage girls for his rich and powerful friends. He started out as a maths teacher in New York, but gave it up to join the global investment bank Bear Stearns. He later started his own company. Epstein's business and charitable interests brought him into contact with many influential people, and it is believed he developed a friendship with Prince Andrew during the 1990s. It was around 2000 that the court papers allege that a woman, identified in reports as Virginia Roberts, was made available to Andrew for sex by Epstein. Epstein was accused in 2008 of sex offences by a number of underage girls and given 18 months in prison for soliciting a minor for prostitution. He was released after serving 13 months. :: Virginia Roberts She has been named in reports as the woman who is alleging she had underage sex with the Duke of York at the behest of Epstein. In an interview with a newspaper she said she had been sexually abused as a child and turned into a problem youngster who ran away from home and slept rough. She was recruited as a masseuse for Epstein aged 15 in Palm Beach, Florida. The court papers allege the then minor was trafficked by Epstein to a number of men for sex, including the Duke, over a number of years. After Epstein was convicted and sent to prison, Ms Roberts sought her own redress. She brought a civil action against him under the pseudonym ""Jane Doe 102"", claiming she was sexually exploited by him and others. The matter was later settled out of court. :: The Duke of York Prince Andrew left his role as the UK's roving business ambassador in 2011 Prince Andrew's relationship with Epstein has already caused controversy. In 2011 Andrew left his role as the UK's roving business ambassador after he was accused of lacking judgement over his links with the billionaire. The Duke had been the UK's Special Representative for International Trade and Investment since 2001, a role which involved travelling around the world promoting Britain's business interests. Since leaving that job, Andrew has forged a new role for himself, championing British enterprise, technology and education. He has hosted a number of events at Buckingham Palace to promote these interests, and is said to be the most tech savvy of the Royal Family. :: Alan Dershowitz Professor Dershowitz says the woman's claims are made up The high-profile American lawyer represented Epstein in the 2008 case and is also named in the court papers. The Harvard law professor has accused the woman's lawyers of conniving with her to make up the allegations, and says they are part of a pattern of ""made-up stories"" against prominent people."

Rosemary Healy, who represents Nottingham City Council's Mapperley ward, has expressed ""profound apologies"" after sharing the image with more than 1,500 followers. She said she did not realise the altered version of the Tory election poster had used an image of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. A Labour Party spokesperson confirmed: ""Rosemary Healy has been suspended from the Labour Party."" David Cameron with the original Conservative election poster The original Conservative poster shows a country road above the slogan ""Let's stay on the road to a stronger economy"". The poster has been mocked in recent days after it emerged the country road shown in the photo is in Germany, not the UK. The altered version of the poster was posted by the @ThomasPride Twitter account and replaced the road with a picture of the railway lines at Auschwitz. ""The new Tory campaign poster featuring a German road's a bit controversial"" the post said, adding the slogan ""more people on zero hours, more tax cuts for the rich, no more NHS"". Ms Healy later deleted her retweet and posted: ""Profound apologies for that retweet which was a genuine mistake and would never have been retweeted had I recognised it for what it was."" The user of the Thomas Pride account has defended the parody image against complaints from other Twitter users. He also insisted the parody poster was legitimate satire, adding that he was of Polish descent."

Members of the Unite union will strike on Tuesday, 13 January, as part of a long-running campaign for a single agreement covering their pay, terms and conditions. Up to 27,000 bus drivers and other workers will take part in the industrial action, affecting companies across the London area, the union said. More than 80 different pay rates cover drivers doing the same job because there is no collective pay deal for drivers, Unite says. Hourly rates can vary by more than £3. Wayne King, the union's London regional officer, said: ""Strike action is not a step our members take lightly, but bus workers who keep London moving 24 hours a day, seven days a week, have had enough of pay inequality and unfair pay disparities."" Mike Weston, Transport for London's Director of Buses, said: ""The current system provides the best value for money for the residents and visitors to London and allows the individual bus companies to determine the best terms and conditions for their individual operating requirements.  ""We are very disappointed that Unite have decided to disrupt Londoners by announcing strike action, particularly given the low turnout for the ballot, and would urge them to think again"". The bus companies involved in the dispute are Arriva North, Arriva South, Selkent, London General, Metroline, Metroline West, Metrobus, CT Plus, London United, Abellio South, Abellio West, London Sovereign, Stagecoach, Blue Triangle, Northumberland Park, Tower Transit, Docklands and London Central."

Mr Jordan with his birthday cards last June Mr Jordan hit headlines globally when he sneaked out to embark on a trip to the D-Day anniversary events in Normandy wearing his war medals under his grey mac.

Amanda Scott, managing director of Gracewell Healthcare, said: ""Bernie caught the world's imagination last year when he made his 'surprise' trip to France and bought a huge amount of joy to a lot of people. ""He will be much missed by everyone here and our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife. ""Bernie was always insistent that what he did during the war was nothing unusual, and only what many thousands of others did for their country. ""That may well be true, but the little bit of excitement he gave everyone last June was typical of his no-nonsense attitude to life and is how he will be remembered by thousands of people."""

The find is vital because the cockpit voice and flight data recorders, or black boxes, are located in the aircraft's tail, and will be crucial to investigators trying to establish why the plane crashed. Underwater footage of wreckage thought to be from the doomed aircraft ""We have successfully obtained part of the plane that has been our target,"" search and rescue agency chief Bambang Soelistyo said. ""The tail portion has been confirmed found."" Gallery: The Search For The Missing AirAsia Plane Relatives at Surabaya airport weep as they receive news that bodies have been found in the hunt for the missing AirAsia plane The section of plane was identified using an underwater remote operated vehicle. Images shown at a news conference after the discovery appeared to show an upside down 'A' on a piece of metal and mechanical parts under the water. Flight QZ8501 came down on 28 December during a storm en route from Indonesia's second city Surabaya to Singapore. Before take-off, the pilot had asked to fly at a higher altitude to avoid the storm, but permission was denied because of the number of planes above him on the busy route. Forty bodies and debris from the plane have been recovered from the surface of the waters off Borneo, but strong winds and high waves have prevented divers from reaching larger pieces of suspected wreckage detected by sonar on the sea floor. It is thought to include parts of the fuselage, where many of the bodies of victims may still be trapped. Mr Soelistyo stressed the main priority was recovering more bodies along with the black boxes. In his last communication, Captain Iriyanto, an experienced former air force pilot, said he wanted to change course to avoid the storm system. Soon after all contact was lost, about 40 minutes after the Airbus A320-200 had taken off. Of the 162 passengers and crew on board, 155 were Indonesian and three South Korean. The other four were from Singapore, Malaysia, Britain and France. Following the disaster, Indonesia has reassigned some airport and air traffic control officials who allowed the flight to take off, and has tightened rules on pre-flight procedures.

2015-01-07,Sky News understands that Oldham Athletic is close to securing a deal to sign convicted rapist Ched Evans.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150107093400/http://news.sky.com/story/1403154/oldham-to-continue-talks-over-ched-evans,"Sky News understands that Oldham Athletic is close to securing a deal to sign convicted rapist Ched Evans. The club and the Professional Footballers' Association are to resume talks after failing to come to a decision on the player's future. The PFA and the club had begun drawing up a joint statement on Tuesday, but several issues remain to be settled. Sky sources have confirmed the club are still working to secure a deal with Evans. The 26-year-old former Sheffield United player was jailed in April 2012 for raping a woman in Rhyl, North Wales. He was released from prison in October and has continued to maintain his innocence. Oldham Athletic confirmed on Monday that they were considering offering the striker a possible route back into professional football, but it is believed they are seeking further assurances from the PFA and other authorities. Since his release from prison, Evans has been rejected by Hartlepool and Tranmere. His former club also offered him a chance to train with the team last November, but went back on the invitation after a public outcry. The Football Supporters' Federation (FSF) said fans were split over the issue. A spokesman said: ""There is no clear consensus from fans one way or the other - this is clearly a very divisive issue in society, not just among supporters. ""Some fans argue that footballers convicted of offences such as rape should never be allowed to play professionally again as it is such a serious crime. ""Other supporters say that once an individual is released from prison, they should be allowed to pursue their previous career so long as the law of the land allows it. ""Even if Evans has the right to play, some fans say they would still feel uncomfortable at the implications of a convicted rapist representing their club."" Two of Oldham's sponsors have threatened to cut ties with the club if the convicted rapist is signed. Craig Verling, director of Verlin Rainwater Solutions, which sponsors a stand at Boundary Park, said on Monday the company would cut ties if Evans was allowed to train with the club. He said: ""The club know our stance and that is if they sign or allow Ched Evans to train we will be out of the door."" Mecca Bingo also said it would end its association with the club if the move goes ahead."

But she did not move fast enough to avoid the force of the crumbing wall from shunting her. A different angle also captured other employees trying to escape from the area as the car entered the building. The driver and 16 office employees escaped with just minor injuries. The truck crashed into the building after colliding with another vehicle, according to local media reports."

Shar-Pei crossbreed Kai was found tied to a railing outside Ayr station on Friday. His suitcase contained a pillow, toy, food and a dog bowl. The Scottish SPCA is attempting to trace Kai's owner. He was sold on the Gumtree website in 2013, but the SPCA has been unable to track down the address of the person who bought him. Inspector Stewart Taylor said: ""The dog is microchipped and we were able to find out his name is Kai. ""We contacted the owner registered to the microchip, who stated they had sold Kai on Gumtree in 2013. Unfortunately they could not tell us the address of the person who bought him. ""This case highlights the potential consequences of selling an animal online as it often leads to the impulse buying of pets that people know very little about. ""Regardless of the fact Kai was left with his belongings, this was still a cruel incident and we are keen to identify the person responsible."" The charity has said it has received more than 100 calls from members of the public interested in giving Kai a new home. Kai is around two or three years old. He is now being cared for at the charity's centre in Glasgow. The SPCA said abandoning an animal is an offence under the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006. People found guilty of doing so can be banned from keeping animals for life."

The London mayor said foreign people who move to the UK should ""do as the Romans do"". He said he was amazed that people were struggling to make themselves understood when speaking English to NHS staff. And he slammed ""multicultural policies"" that had allowed communities in Britain to become completely non English-speaking. His comments come after UKIP leader Nigel Farage told Sky News doctors and nurses who could not speak proper English should be banned from the NHS. Speaking on LBC Radio, Mr Johnson, who has been tipped as the future leader of the Conservative party and will stand for election as MP in May, said: ""I'm amazed by reports that people cannot make themselves understood in English in this country to people working in the NHS. That is completely wrong. I'm sure NHS managers will be taking steps to sort it out. ""I think that we should have a culture in this country that if you come here, you do as the Romans do, you learn English and you speak English."" He added: ""You go to Tower Hamlets, places like that, you can find people who have been there for several generations who still don't speak English. One of the reasons is that the media is so massive now, so disparate, so diffuse, so diverse that people can be tuned in to their own communities and not feel the need to learn the common language of this city and this country. ""I think that is a great, great shame, it is a huge wasted opportunity for them and I think everybody in this country - particularly people working in our public services - should speak English."" At the weekend, Mr Farage told Sky's Dermot Murnaghan: ""Don't we want to live in a country where we speak the same language and isn't it scandalous that we are not training enough nurses and doctors in our own country? ""I don't know about you, whether you have even been to a GP who doesn’t speak very good English, but it's something that people out there are talking about."" Mr Farage said: ""If people don't speak English and they are dealing with English-speaking patients surely they shouldn't be employed in the first place."" It is estimated that around 11% of the 1.3 million workers in the NHS are not British born, which means UKIP's plans could potentially affect as many as 130,000 health service staff. David Cameron's official spokesman said: ""The Government's approach is that people who work in the NHS - be it from outside or inside the EU - should have the necessary and appropriate language skills to be able to operate in it. ""That is the Government's policy, the Government has made changes on that and, as of last year, that is something that applies to all health care professionals, whatever part of the world they may be from, across the NHS."""

Emergency services were called to the scene on the M4 between Chippenham and Swindon in Wiltshire at about 6.40pm on Monday. The 47-year-old's black Seat Ibiza had hit the wild boar in lane two of the motorway before colliding with a white Renault articulated lorry. The man, from Royal Wootton Bassett, was pronounced dead at the scene. His family has been informed. The driver of the Renault lorry received treatment at the scene for minor shoulder injuries.   Police are appealing for witnesses to contact them as soon as possible. Sergeant Steven Love said: ""This is a truly tragic incident and my thoughts are with the family and friends of the victim. ""It is quite rare for a wild boar to be on the carriageway of the motorway. ""It is more common for the police to receive calls involving horses or deer but each is equally dangerous to motorists. ""This was a particularly large wild animal and would have caused considerable damage to any vehicle."" Anyone with information is asked to contact PC Mark Cargill via 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 where information may be left anonymously. Wild boar roam free in areas of British countryside and are usually active at night. Males can weigh up to 175kg."

Hayat Boumeddiene, a suspect in the murder of a Paris policewoman on Thursday, is on the run after her partner Amedy Coulibaly was killed when armed officers brought his kosher supermarket siege to a violent end. Police are searching for Hayat Boumeddiene The 26-year-old could hold the key to the ongoing terror investigation, as police admit they could be dealing with a larger extremist cell and al Qaeda threaten more attacks. Boumeddiene is believed to have travelled to Syria via Turkey in recent days, and may not have been in France when the supermarket siege began. A security source told the AFP news agency that Turkey failed to arrest her due to a lack of intelligence from France. The two countries are now believed to be working together to try and locate her. Details are emerging of the young woman of Algerian descent and the links between Coulibaly, 32, and the Kouachi brothers, who were killed two days after murdering 12 people at the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.  Boumeddiene and the wife of one of the brothers exchanged more than 500 phone calls in 2014, according to Paris prosecutor Francois Molins. She reportedly started wearing a niqab in May 2009 after meeting Coulibaly and was sacked from her job as a cashier. Later that year, they were married in a religious ceremony but were not wed under French law, which requires a civil ceremony. According to French judicial documents, the couple travelled with Cherif Kouachi and his wife in 2010 to southern France to visit radical Islamist Djamel Beghal, who was under house arrest. The pair posed for photos during the visit, taking selfies and a snap of Boumeddiene pointing a crossbow at the camera. Interviewed that year by counter-terrorism officers over Coulibaly's involvement in an attempt to free Paris Metro bomber Smain Ait Ali Belkacem from jail, she was open about her fanatical views. According to Le Nouvel Observateur, she refused to condemn al Qaeda attacks, preferring to criticise America's military interventions around the world and the Western media. A police search of Coulibaly's residence in 2010 turned up a crossbow, 240 rounds of 7.62mm ammunition, films and photos of him during a trip to Malaysia, and letters seeking false official documents. In a police interview that same year, Coulibaly identified Cherif Kouachi as a friend he had met in prison and said they saw each other frequently, according to a transcript of the interview obtained by the Journal du Dimanche newspaper. According to the newspaper, he told the police that people he met in prison used the nickname ""Dolly"" for him. He was employed as a temp worker at a Coca-Cola factory and reportedly met then-President Nicolas Sarkozy in 2009. ""I know a lot of criminals because I met heaps of them in detention,"" he is quoted as telling the police.

""This could very well be a little cell,"" he said. ""There are probably more than three people,"" he added, given that Cherif Kouachi and Coulibaly had had contacts with other jihadist groups in the past.

Commandos stormed the supermarket minutes after two brothers behind the slaughter at Charlie Hebdo magazine were killed at a second siege on the outskirts of Paris. The special forces team raided the shop as the gunman began his evening prayer. Six explosions were heard at the Jewish supermarket in Porte de Vincennes and several hostages were seen running, or being carried, from the store. At least one of those being carried out was a small child. Fifteen hostages were freed alive. Gallery: Commandos Storm Supermarket Commandos stormed the kosher supermarket where a gunman had taken at least six people hostage. Pic: @conflictnews It was initially hoped that all hostages in the shop had been saved - but it is now clear that a number died. Others have been critically wounded, including a police officer. Reports in the French media suggested that at least some of the hostages were killed before the raid. Reports that a gunman may have escaped from the siege were dismissed as ""unlikely"" by officials. The hostage-taker at the Paris store was linked to the killer brothers who were holding another hostage at a commercial building at Dammartin-en-Goele, near to Charles de Gaulle airport.   The supermarket gunman - named as Amedy Coulibaly - had threatened to kill the hostages if police moved in on the brothers at Dammartin.   He told a French TV station that he was a member of the Islamic State group and was in cahoots with the Charlie Hebdo killers who were his ""officers"". In a telling detail, revealed by BFMTV, the supermarket attacker did not hang up the phone properly after talking to its reporters, allowing the police to overhear him. And it was as he knelt to do his evening prayer that they stormed the building. Sky's crime correspondent Martin Brunt said: ""After news came through of the situation Dammartin there seemed to be a sense of urgency here. ""We heard four very quick explosions that lasted between them seven seconds I suspect."" There were another two explosions shortly afterwards. Minutes later hostages were pictured being carried out, or running out, of the market - as sirens wailed across the city. Sources reported that police managed to hack video surveillance at the market to keep a close eye on what was happening inside. It is also understood that officers were secretly communicating by phone with one of the hostages. It is understood that police may have managed to close down communication between the hostage-takers in the two sieges.   Click here for our live blog In press conferences in Paris after the drama, France's president Francois Hollande and Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve praised the bravery of police.

""Long live the Republic and long live France,"" he said. A police officer told Sky News that the siege began when a gunman went in the supermarket and started shooting immediately. According to the AP news agency, which quoted a police source, the gunman said ""You know who I am"" as he opened fire inside. About 100 students were placed under lockdown in schools nearby and the Paris ring road was closed. Coulibaly, 32, was involved in the killing of a policewoman in Montrouge, southern Paris, on Thursday. French police released mugshots of him and a female accomplice - Hayat Boumeddiene, 26.

'An Assault on Democracy', said the Guardian. The magazine Charlie Hebdo paid a sickening price for publishing cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed. Masked gunmen conducted their own brutal form of censorship in Paris. But it was notable that no British newspaper or broadcaster republished the cartoons that appear to have caused particular offence. ""Freedom of the press cuts both ways and you have to be entitled to make editorial judgements,"" said Sun managing editor Stig Abell. Gallery: The Pencil Is Mightier Than The Gun Cartoonists all over the world have been picking up their pencils to show their support for the murdered artists on Charlie Hebdo magazine. This was by Carlos Latuff, posted on @LatuffCartoons
latuffcartoons.wordpress.com ""The British press is entitled to say 'we don't want to run those cartoons because we can tell the story without running them and we recognise that it can cause distress to a certain number of people'."" But others are concerned about a trend towards greater self-censorship. Journalist and commentator Douglas Murray told Sky News: ""Once people are killed for the cartoon, the cartoon is the story and therefore to inform the readers they have to see what the story is about."" Not least because, in his view: ""People think the images are far worse than they are."" Cartoonists around the world had their own individual ways of responding to an atrocity that was clearly directed at the freedom of expression within their trade. Rubben Oppenheimer drew a picture of an aircraft heading for two pencils erected like the twin towers.  David Pope of the Canberra Times had a gunman over the body of a cartoonist with the speech bubble: ""He drew first."" The fact that humour is being used by cartoonists to depict the terrorist attack would no doubt be welcomed by its victims, along with the announcement that a million copies of Charlie Hebdo magazine will be published next week. But some see the reticence to reproduce the controversial image as a form of appeasement towards the gunmen. Martin Rowson, a cartoonist for British newspapers, told Sky News: ""You don't appease people who want to kill you. People say you shouldn't insult people - but which people are we talking about? ""I think these people are not defined by their religion, they are defined by the fact that they are murderers. And if we are going to start saying you should appease murderers, then we might as well just throw civilisation away. ""You might as well close down the history channel because it shows films about the Second World War which will upset Nazis."""
2015-01-11,The Prime Minister has given his strongest indication that the TV election debates will not proceed in their current proposed form.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150111011814/http://news.sky.com/story/1404465/cameron-rules-out-current-debate-proposal,"By Faisal Islam, Political Editor The Prime Minister has given his strongest indication that the TV election debates will not proceed in their current proposed form. In an interview, David Cameron was asked if he was not going to go in to the debates, as it stands, unless at least the Green Party is involved. ""Correct"", he told ITV News. The PM has long made an argument that the Green Party should be involved in any TV debate. But this is the first time he has confirmed that this is a red line issue for any discussions about the debates. The Conservatives' official rationale is that the Green Party is polling more than the Lib Dems, and has had elected House of Commons' representation since the 2010 General Election. But many senior Conservatives have been sceptical about the benefit of the debates to their election chances, and blame them for the fact that David Cameron failed to win an overall majority in 2010. The current proposal is a joint plan from four broadcasters - Sky News, the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 - for three different debates in a 4-3-2 strategy. One would feature four (Con, Lab, Lib, UKIP), then three (Con, Lab, Lib) and then a final Miliband-Cameron head to head. Opposition leader Ed Miliband accused the Prime Minister of ""shoddy behaviour"", saying the Conservatives should ""accept the broadcasters' proposals…it's for them to decide"". Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg said on Twitter: ""Come on David Cameron, the broadcasters have invited us, the public expect it, just say yes and stop making excuses."" UKIP leader Nigel Farage tweeted that the Prime Minister was ""a chicken running scared"". As UKIP are now more or less guaranteed to take part in some form, if the debates occur, some Conservative strategists are concerned that any debates without the Greens will damage them but not Labour. On Thursday morning Ofcom, the media regulator, ruled that UKIP, but not the Green Party, would be accorded ""major party"" status at the General Election. At the time the 4-3-2 strategy was announced in October, Mr Cameron questioned the inclusion of UKIP, saying: ""If you have one person, then the Greens have an MP as well, so you have to think these things through. ""I've always been in favour of TV debates. I'm in favour of TV debates, but you've got to make sure you come up with a proposal that everyone can agree to, and I can't see how you can have one party in that has an MP in Parliament, and not another party."" And Green Party MP Caroline Lucas tweeted: ""Taking legal advice over Green exclusion from TV debates. Apparently 'messy' to have too many candidates. Democracy IS messy - sort it out!"" She later also told Sky News the debate should have more diversity. She said: ""Do you want politics to look like it's four men in grey suits, white men, middle-aged men, and that's supposed to reflect the diversity of Britain? No, it doesn't."""

The 56-year-old was found guilty of 11 charges last May, including a plot to establish an al Qaeda training camp in the US state of Oregon. He was also convicted of providing a satellite phone and advice to Yemeni militants who kidnapped Western tourists in 1998. UK Home Secretary Theresa May said she was pleased with Hamza's sentence Judge Katherine Forrest told Hamza: ""Evil comes in many forms but doesn't always show itself immediately in all its darkness... ""There is a side of you which this court believes is evil."" The judge said his actions were ""barbaric, misguided and wrong"". Sky News' Hannah Thomas-Peter, who was at Friday's hearing, said Hamza addressed the Manhattan court shortly before learning his fate. He said even a lenient sentence would ""consume the rest of his life"", and pleaded to be kept in a medical facility. Hamza, who wore blue prison clothes, asked the court that his incarceration not be a ""back door for a slow-motion crucifixion, not a back door for torture"". He also complained about his last two-and-a-half years in a Manhattan holding prison. ""I've been coerced to do things no disabled should be asked to do,"" he said. ""This is torture. When the cuts happen, when the pain happens, when the stress happens."" Hamza finished by pleading in the courtroom, just a few blocks from Ground Zero, that ""the victims of all wars get together ... and investigate how the (Twin) Towers collapsed"". He said he wanted ""victims of all this false intelligence to see their day in court"". Throughout the hearing, Hamza had access to a prosthetic with a pen attachment for making notes, which he seldom wore. Manhattan prosecutor Preet Bharara issued a statement on the sentencing that made reference to the jihadist attacks in France. ""Abu Hamza's blood-soaked journey from cleric to convict, from imam to inmate, is now complete,"" he said. Hamza's lawyers said their client's toenails were not cut for nine weeks, causing them grow painfully into his skin. His legal team have argued he is too disabled to spend life in a high-security jail. They say the court should consider Hamza's disabilities - including his amputated forearms, psoriasis, diabetes and high blood pressure. UK Home Secretary Theresa May said on Friday: ""His sentence reflects the severity of his crimes and I am pleased he will spend the rest of his life behind bars where he belongs."" In the 1990s Hamza led London’s Finsbury Park Mosque, which was reportedly attended by 9/11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui and shoe-bomber Richard Reid. Hamza denied ever having met the pair. He later spread violent messages at the mosque after the 9/11 attacks. Hamza was jailed in Britain for seven years for soliciting murder and inciting racial hatred in 2006."

Mr Miliband criticised the Prime Minister's decision. ""Yesterday David Cameron was saying that he was worried about TV debates because they might get in the way of talking to voters,"" he said. ""Today he has ducked out of a chance to engage with young voters and face their questions. ""Any fair-minded person will conclude David Cameron is running scared - of his record and the British people."" Mr Farage tweeted: ""First Cameron chickens out of TV debates, then ducks Bite The Ballot. Will he speak to the British public or is he in hiding?"" The decision was revealed a day after Mr Cameron said he would not take part in leaders' debates ahead of the General Election unless the Green Party was included. Negotiations about the Prime Minister's appearance with Bite The Ballot have taken place since March last year, according to managing director Michael Sani. He said: ""Is the Prime Minister saying he can't devote an hour across the next 118 days to a demographic made up of 5.9 million voters?"""

It has had to inject almost £5m to prop up the trust - and reaching this level would trigger an option to cancel the deal. The company said it was ""highly likely"" it would have to pump in more cash as conditions had ""significantly worsened in recent weeks"". Circle blamed unprecedented rises in people visiting A&E and a lack of care places for patients awaiting discharge. And bosses have claimed funding has been cut by 10.1% this financial year. They are also facing an imminent report from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) which is expected to be ""unbalanced"". Circle began operating the trust in February 2012 but in August warned of ""uncertainty over Hinchingbrooke's profitability over the next year"". In a statement on Friday the company said: ""Circle today announces that it has determined that its franchise to operate Hinchingbrooke Health Care NHS Trust is no longer sustainable under current terms and that it has entered into discussions with the NHS Trust Development Authority (TDA) with the view to ensuring an orderly withdrawal from the current contract."" Circle said it had invested in the quality of care and in staff and facilities while saving the taxpayer £23m in its first two years. Low mortality rates, ""excellent"" patient feedback and waiting time targets have all been met, the company said. Chief executive Steve Melton said: ""Like most hospitals, over the past year Hinchingbrooke saw unprecedented A&E attendances and not enough care places for healthy patients awaiting discharge. ""At the same time, our funding has been cut. We also believe that inconsistent and conflicting regulatory regimes compound the challenge for acute hospitals in this environment. ""This combination of factors means we have now reluctantly concluded that, in its existing form, Circle's involvement in Hinchingbrooke is unsustainable."" A Department of Health spokesman said: ""We're disappointed Circle has made this decision. ""There will now be a managed transfer of the running of the trust and patient care will not be affected."" Downing Street added that just 6% of NHS services were provided by the private sector - up only marginally from 5% under Labour. But shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ""It was the decision of the coalition in November 2011 to appoint Circle and they must take responsibility for this mess. ""The Government were explicitly warned two years ago about the risky business model Circle were operating, but failed to take any action."""
2015-01-11,"Security at ports and train stations that act as a border into the UK has been tightened up in the wake of the attack on the Charlie Hebdo magazine in Paris, the government has said.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150111011814/http://news.sky.com/story/1404327/uks-borders-tightened-after-paris-attacks,"Security at ports and train stations that act as a border into the UK has been tightened up in the wake of the attack on the Charlie Hebdo magazine in Paris, the government has said. The Prime Minister's spokesman told journalists that there had been no change to the UK's terrorism threat level but the government had decided to take extra measures. Sky sources said a visible extra security presence was expected to be in place both at British and French ports and stations which serve destinations in the UK. It is believed that passengers using stations serving Eurostar and Le Shuttle and ports that serve ferries to and from France will be among those affected. Passengers, cars and freight trains at places like Calais and the Gard du Nord in Paris could be subject to extra checks. British Transport Police said they had also increased armed patrols at the Eurostar terminal at London's St Pancras station. The sources said that the decision to boost security was not based on any specific intelligence, but rather was ""an appropriate"" response to the events on Wednesday that left 12 people dead after an attack on a French satirical magazine. The current threat level remains at severe, the Home Office said. Home Secretary Theresa May said: ""The cowardly attacks that took place in Paris yesterday have shocked and sickened people in the UK and around the world. ""In deliberately targeting and murdering journalists, the terrorists were attacking freedom and democracy. And in murdering police officers, they attacked the people who risk their own safety every day to protect us and our way of life."" The sources added that there was no evidence of a link between Britain and the attacks in France, or indeed the suspects and Britain. There has also been no intelligence to suggest that any copy cat type attacks may happen in the UK. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) is in the process of updating advice to British travellers to France. Earlier, the FCO described Wednesday's attack on the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris and the latest in Montrouge on its website and told visitors: ""You should take extra care at this time and follow the security advice issued by the French authorities."" The department said an additional counter terrism officer from the Metropolitan Police will be based at the British Embassy in Paris. It has emerged that on Wednesday, Mr Cameron, German chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Francois Hollande had a joint phone call. Earlier, Mrs Merkel and the Prime Minister had been given a joint briefing by British intelligence services - a move that Downing Street described as unusual. Meanwhile, an extract of a speech that the Director General of MI5, Andrew Parker, is due to give has been released. In it, he says: ""It is too early for us to come to judgements about the precise details or origin of the attack but it is a terrible reminder of the intentions of those who wish to do us harm. ""As you would expect, we are offering our French colleagues our full support as they respond."""

Arash Derambarsh, who has published books of cartoons by Stephane Charbonnier, the magazine's editor known as Charb, and Jean Cabut, known by the pen name Cabu, paid tribute to the ""amazing job"" done by the police and special forces. ""Tonight France said to the terrorists we never give up in front of the terrorists, we never give up,"" he said. Twelve people were killed in the attack on the satirical magazine on Wednesday before the suspected gunmen went on the run, robbing a petrol station and prompting a huge manhunt across northern France. The brothers were cornered in a printing works near Charles de Gaulle airport on Friday and died as the building was stormed. Mr Derambarsh said he had met Charb 10 days before Christmas and urged him to stay safe over the holidays, but the cartoonist had replied: ""Who wants to kill me, who wants to kill a caricaturist, I just draw cartoons?"" President Francois Hollande also praised the ""courageous"" security forces after police had killed Said and Cherif Kouachi, along with another gunman, Ahmed Coulibaly, who had taken hostages in a kosher supermarket. He said they had ""faced down"" the terrorist but warned France ""has not finished with the threats targeting it"". ""I call you all to be vigilant, to remain united and remain mobilised. ""Vigilance is something the state must demonstrate,"" he said. ""I ask you to remain united - it's our best weapon. ""It shows we are determined to fight against anything that can divide us."" Prime Minister Manuel Valls, speaking separately to TF1 television, said: ""We are confronting an unprecedented terrorist challenge."" He said of this week's violence: ""There will be a before and an after of what happened."" A mass demonstration has been called for Sunday to honour the 12 people killed at the Charlie Hebdo offices, a policewoman shot dead by Coulibaly and four hostages who died in the supermarket. Mr Hollande will attend the ""unity rally"" along with several world leaders, including Britain's David Cameron and Germany's Angela Merkel.  Mr Cameron said on Twitter that the rally would be ""celebrating the values"" of Charlie Hebdo. :: Watch Sky News Special Report: Paris Attack at 4.30pm and 8.30pm.

Drivers have been benefiting from lower prices at UK pumps as the cost of oil plummets on world markets - the result of a glut in supply and fears for global economic growth. Figures released on Thursday by Experian Catalist showed the average cost of unleaded on Wednesday fell to 109.8p - a drop of more than half 1p in a day. Sources suggested that falls in average petrol costs of more than 2p in a day last month had not been seen in 15 years. Petrol prices fell by 10p-a-litre in December alone - from 121.44p at the start of the month. Experian Catalist said the last time unleaded stood below 110p was on 3 January 2010. Diesel also continued to fall but more slowly, with the average on Wednesday at 117p-per-litre. Fuel experts have suggested that the dramatic fall in oil costs is likely to result in unleaded petrol prices going below 100p-per-litre in the coming months. The chief executive of Sainsbury's which, along with its major supermarket competitors, has led the way in passing on petrol price cuts to motorists, told Sky News on Wednesday he believed such a price was possible. The Government has ordered an investigation to ensure petrol retailers, energy firms and airlines are charging customers fairly. Brent crude oil was trading at $51-per-barrel on Friday having lost more than half its value since June."

Gunshots and explosions were heard at the Dammartin-en-Goele warehouse, where brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi had been holed up with a 26-year-old male hostage for hours. According to media reports in France, the brothers - who came out firing - have been killed and their hostage was freed safely. Some reports claim he was hidden in a corner of the building and communicating with police. A helicopter that had been hovering nearby landed on top of the building during the raid. Sky's Ian Woods, who is on the scene, said: ""There were several bursts of gunfire that lasted about 10 seconds. Since then we've heard four or five explosions."" There was then around a minute of silence, followed by further explosions. Several ambulances were then seen travelling at speed in the area of the factory complex following the explosions, close to the outskirts of Paris and near to Charles De Gaulle airport. It came as six explosions were heard at the Paris supermarket where at least six hostages have been held by gunmen. Reports say four of the hostages plus the hostage-taker have been killed. The two incidents are apparently linked to each other, and to al Qaeda. Minutes before the Dammartin-en-Goele operation, dozens of workers who had been trapped on the industrial estate next to the stand-off were seen leaving the area in their cars, accompanied by a police escort. Gallery: From Car Chase To Last Stand Two brothers suspected of killing 12 people at the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris have been killed. They had earlier taken one person hostage as police cornered the gunmen in the area, northeast of Paris This was followed by a number of cars heading in the other directions towards the factory, filled with individuals wearing balaclavas. The Kouachi brothers had been surrounded at the print works by special forces officers for several hours. They took refuge in the building with a hostage after being forced off the road into Paris by a police roadblock. Earlier in the day they broke cover from an area northeast of the capital and stole a car, before heading towards Paris. A police chase took place and they were forced off the road close to the city's outskirts. :: Watch Sky News Special Report: Paris Attack at 8.30pm and tomorrow at 4.30pm and 8.30pm.

2015-01-11,"Al Qaeda is plotting to massacre huge numbers of civilians in Britain and other western countries, the head of Mi5 has warned.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150111011814/http://news.sky.com/story/1404631/mi5-al-qaeda-plotting-new-massacre-in-britain,"By Sam Kiley, Foreign Affairs Editor Al Qaeda is plotting to massacre huge numbers of civilians in Britain and other western countries, the head of Mi5 has warned. Andrew Parker, director general of the security service, told a select group mostly from the Royal United Services Institute at his London headquarters that while the so-called Islamic State is the newest threat to the West and that self-started lone wolf plots are hard to foil, al Qaeda still has ambitions for something more spectacular. He said: ""We know that terrorists based in Syria harbour... ambitions towards the UK - trying to direct attacks against our country, and exhorting extremists here to act independently."" But this was in addition to newly identified plans from al Qaeda to revisit their traditional style of operations. He said: ""…we still face more complex and ambitious plots that follow the now sadly well-established approach of al Qaeda and its imitators: attempts to cause large scale loss of life, often by attacking transport systems or iconic targets. ""We know, for example, that a group of core al Qaeda terrorists in Syria is planning mass casualty attacks against the West."" Al Qaeda experts are known to have moved from Pakistan to Syria, where they may be able to draw on British volunteers to conduct attacks in the UK. Their mission is entirely focussed on plots against the West. They are known to be led by Muhsin al Fadhli, an expert bomb maker wanted by the FBI who has a $7m price on his head. He moved to Syria two years ago and was unsuccessfully targeted in a coalition air strike last year. It is also known that British citizens are in the ranks of al Qaeda in Syria and could be used in a major atrocity back home. The domestic spy chief spoke hours after the UK's COBRA committee ordered a boost to national security. Home Secretary Theresa May said: ""Following the attacks we took the precautionary step yesterday of increasing security at the French-UK border. ""The UK threat level, which is set by the independent Joint Terrorism Advisory Centre, remains at severe; that means a terrorist attack is highly likely and the public should remain vigilant. ""This morning I chaired COBRA to consider Britain's response to the attacks and our own preparedness to a similar attack."" Extra police have already been deployed at British ports and stations serving the Eurostar. Lone wolf plots aimed at the police and military have surged over the last year and these have combined with the Paris killings to cause unease among officers. ""It's a huge worry for us,"" said Sir Peter Fahy, chief constable of Greater Manchester Police. ""There is a particular increased threat to police officers at the moment and there have been a number of attacks foiled in differed parts of the country, but I can tell you that our officers are very concerned about it… they see what happened in France, and clearly we are an unarmed police force but it is the nature of that threat which is worrying but despite that our officers go out there and do their duty.""  Such concerns from front line police reflect similar fears in the intelligence community. Put simply - the world is getting more dangerous."
2015-01-11,The US is pulling out of a major UK airbase and will hand back two others to the RAF.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150111011814/http://news.sky.com/story/1404418/major-us-airbase-raf-mildenhall-to-close,"The US is pulling out of a major UK airbase and will hand back two others to the RAF. The Pentagon has recommended that RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk should be closed after carrying out a review of US forces based in Europe, the US Defense Secretary has confirmed. RAF Alconbury and RAF Molesworth in Cambridgeshire will also undergo ""divestment"", but according to US defence news outlet Stars and Stripes they will be returned to British control. Although all are termed as RAF bases, they have been under the control of the US Air Force for several decades. RAF Mildenhall is one of the biggest US bases in the country and is home to the US air refuelling tankers, Air Force special operations wing and around 3,200 military personnel. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon described the decision to pull out of Mildenhall as ""disappointing"". Stars and Stripes said the 352nd special operations group currently stationed on the base will relocate to Germany. The Bury Free Press newspaper said that a total of around 2,600 military personnel will be moved to other locations in the UK and Europe, with a reduction of around 1,300 military and civilian staff. Around 1,200 of the personnel at Alconbury and Molesworth will be reassigned to RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire. A further 200 military, civilian and ""local national"" positions will go, the USAF Europe announced. Other bases in Germany, Netherlands, Italy and Belgium will also close as part of European Infrastructure Consolidation (EIC) process which is intended to save the US government around $500m a year. General Frank Gorenc, US Air Forces in Europe and Air Forces Africa (USAFE-AFA) commander, said: ""The UK remains an essential location for forward-based and ready forces ""Our close relationship with the UK government and integrated missions with UK forces remain integral to USAFE's ability to execute successful missions in support of our NATO Allies. ""The RAF Croughton site ensures continuation of the strong US intelligence relationship with the United Kingdom and will result in an exponential increase in US-NATO intelligence collaboration efforts."" US Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said: ""As part of an overall restructuring of our forces and basing in Europe, we have been working with our Allies to reposition thousands of our military and civilian personnel within Europe. ""In the end, this transformation of our infrastructure will help maximize our military capabilities in Europe, so that we can best support our NATO Allies and partners in the region."" A Ministry of Defence spokesman said it planned to release a statement on Thursday afternoon. It is thought the review will recommend the basing of two squadrons of F-35 jets at RAF Lakenheath from 2020, along with 1,200 troops. The Lakenheath airbase is about four miles from the one in Mildenhall and also in Suffolk. Both airbases make a major contribution to the local economies. Mildenhall Parish Council chairman John Bloodworth told the Bury Free Press: ""It will have a devastating effect on Mildenhall, on employment, the economy and our schools. It is a very sad day for the town."""
2015-01-11,"Obesity affects a quarter of UK adults, but what is of most concern is its burden on the NHS.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150111011814/http://news.sky.com/story/1403335/huge-increase-in-hospital-obesity-operations,"By Tom Sanders, Emeritus Professor of Nutrition & Dietetics, King's College London Obesity affects a quarter of UK adults, but what is of most concern is its burden on the NHS. Severe obesity can cause sleep apnoea, where breathing is interrupted, and can be fatal if untreated. Patients with this disorder are often offered weight reducing bariatric surgery. There has been a huge increase in primary referrals to the NHS for severe obesity, mainly in adults between 35 and 54. The NHS is currently unable to cope with the increased demand for bariatric surgery. However, an even greater burden to the NHS caused by obesity is type 2 diabetes, which carries long-term risks of heart attack, stroke, blindness, limb amputation and kidney failure.  The total number of obesity-related admissions rose from 29,237 in 2002/3 to 292,404 in 2012/13, mainly because of the increase in numbers with type 2 diabetes. There are no 'magic' diet foods or combinations, says Professor Sanders Obesity also increases the risk of cancer of the womb, large bowel and liver - as well as increasing the rate of wear and tear on the hip and knee joints. Unless obesity can be successfully prevented, it will overwhelm the NHS.  Obesity is a consequence of depositing excess amounts of fat in the body and this only occurs when energy intake from food and drink (measured in calories or kilojoules on food labels) exceeds energy expenditure. Women need about 2000 calories each day, men about 2500. The major cause of the current epidemic is an increased calorie intake, although physical activity has also declined. Foods high in fat and sugar are tasty and often the focus of much of the blame, but in many cases it is just eating too much (large portions) or eating and drinking (sugary drinks and alcohol) too frequently; even good food can make you fat if you eat too much!  Any diet that reduces energy intake will result in weight loss. There are no magical combinations of foods that promote weight loss and don’t be fooled into thinking that weight can be lost quickly. Experience shows that women can lose up to 1kg (about 2lbs) in a week, and men about 1.5 kg (3lbs) if they cut their calorie intake to 1200-1400 calories a day. This can be achieved either by not eating two days a week or by limiting the amount of carbohydrate containing foods (bread, cakes, biscuits, rice, pasta, pastry, potatoes and sugar), and avoiding deep-fried foods. A little more weight is often lost in the first week on a diet but this is mainly due to loss of body water associated with lower stores of carbohydrate.  Excess weight lost by dieting is often regained as people revert to their old habits. Maintaining a healthy weight means sticking to dietary rules for life and this is made much easier if food is eaten at fixed mealtimes and ""snacking on the hoof"" is avoided.  Regular physical activity also helps prevent weight gain: aim to walk 30 minutes each day and engage in some more vigorous activity once or twice a week. It is sensible to try to shed those extra kilos gained over Christmas by eating and drinking less over the coming months."

Kieron Flux, from Newport on the Isle of Wight, disappeared after a night out in Val d'Isere.

Jet streams are fast moving ribbons of air, typically found 30,000 feet up in the atmosphere and can extend for several miles long and reach speeds of 200mph. They are formed through significant differences between conflicting air masses. Currently the jet stream is reaching speeds of up to 250mph, which is stronger than normal. This is due to the dangerously cold conditions across the northern states of America, where day time temperatures have been well below freezing, reacting with the warm air in the south. So on Friday and Saturday, the strength of the jet stream will cause two low pressure systems to deepen rapidly and pass to the north of the UK, bringing downpours of rain. More significantly though, it will also bring very strong winds - gusting in excess of 100mph across the far north-west of Scotland."

Many were quick to dissociate the actions of the gunmen in Paris with the views of Muslims or the Islamic faith. “How can these people use the name of Islam as justification to murder people, murder children, murder journalists, murder people who have done nothing wrong, just expressed their opinion? Come on! That’s not Islam,"" said Gulam Taslim, an undertaker in Whitechapel. ""Regardless of race and religion, there is a real sense of loss for the families of the people who died in Paris,"" said Bilal Mahmood, a lawyer from Walthamstow. ""They were involved in politics, in thought, in creativity, in challenging ideas and satire. I had more in common with them than I ever would with their attackers."" Others questioned the inevitable questions being asked of the wider Muslim community. ""There’s a growing frustration within the Muslim community to feel that with any event, you know, they have to take kind of take a back-seat and immediately apologise for something when it has nothing to do with us as individuals on an individual basis,” said Anisa Ahmed, a student from Ilford. But as attention inevitably turns to the question of whether images such as those published by Charlie Hebdo and deemed offensive to many Muslims are acceptable in satirical publications, a separate debate about freedom of expression was also emerging. The attack on the French magazine follows previous violence sparked by controversial literature and film, including Salman Rushie's Satanic Verses, which angered Muslims in 1989 and led to Iran's Ayatollah issuing a fatwa for him to be killed, and the murder of Dutch director Theo Van Gogh, after his film Submission depicted violence against Muslim women. ""I grew up in the West and there's these sense of Western liberal values that do get bestowed upon you. Am I that offended by just a depiction of the prophet? Probably not and I'm not going to lose any sleep over that,"" said Mr Mahmood. ""Going beyond that and depicting him in an offensive way, that would be something that is worthy of a discussion. But it's a discussion within the bubble of sensible, peace-loving western democracies."" “I would say from a personal Islamic point of view, to depict pictures of the Prophet, peace be upon him, is offensive for me,"" said Ms Ahmed."

2015-01-11,The latest batch of bleak A&E statistics strongly suggests the lack of social care beds is clogging up hospitals.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150111011814/http://news.sky.com/story/1404936/a-and-e-crisis-more-patients-not-to-blame,"The latest batch of bleak A&E statistics strongly suggests the lack of social care beds is clogging up hospitals. The headline figure - just 86.7% of patients dealt with in the target time of four hours (week ending 4 January) - is the worst since weekly data collection began in 2010. But the number of patients going to A&E wasn't exceptionally high last week - 50,000 below the peak. So it's not high demand that lies behind these figures. Dig deeper into the data and the real reason becomes clear. Gallery: When Should You Go To A&E? Unresponsive - Loss of consciousness More than 16,000 patients waited for at least four hours on a trolley even AFTER doctors had decided they were sick enough to be admitted to hospital. And 241 patients waited more than 12 hours. The comparable figures for the same week last year were just over 5,000 patients waiting more than four hours and 24 waiting more than 12 hours. So a dramatic rise in trolley waits. Hospitals are simply full. There is nowhere for the new arrivals to go. As Sky News has reported - based on other NHS England statistics - there are record numbers of hospital beds 'blocked' by healthy patients who can't be discharged because there are no care beds for them in the community. Local authority budgets have been severely cut in recent years - and they don't 'buy' enough care home places. So elderly patients are left in hospital beds that they don't need. And emergency patients can't be admitted. It is a serious situation. And the Government needs to get on top of it."

He said: ""We are doing our best, our utmost in order to fight against terrorism but there are always ways for terrorism to slip in. ""We have to be really strong, really tough as far as the enemies of freedom are concerned."" Gallery: France In Mourning After Attacks A French police officer carries flowers outside the Hyper Cacher kosher supermarket Thousands have turned out for rallies across the country in the wake of the attacks, and march of unity is planned in Paris on Sunday. AQAP has claimed it directed brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi in the attack on Charlie Hebdo ""as revenge for the honour"" of the Prophet Mohammed. The gunman killed by police at a kosher supermarket in Paris has told how he ""co-ordinated"" with the Charlie Hebdo killers and was a member of the Islamic State (IS) group. Gallery: Faces Of French Terror Victims Charlie Hebdo editor Stephane Charbonnier, 47, had received death threats in the past and was living under police protection. Known as Charb, He and his nine colleagues, along with the two policemen were killed at the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris Amedy Coulibaly's call to France's BFMTV station emerged after gunfire and explosions marked the violent conclusion to two hostage-takings 30 miles (48km) apart. Just minutes separated the series of blasts at the Paris store and those that destroyed a warehouse in Dammartin-en-Goele, where the Kouachi brothers were holed up. Police stormed both buildings almost simultaneously, killing both brothers, while at least four hostages and the jihadist gunman died at the Paris grocery store. Authorities have praised the quick instincts of some of the survivors in the two incidents, including an employee at the printing works who provided information to police whilst hidden under a sink. Coulibaly told BFMTV in the call from the supermarket that he had worked with the Kouachi brothers, who he described as his ""officers"". Police became convinced the two attacks were linked after they discovered that Coulibaly's wife and fellow suspect Hayat Boumeddiene and the partner of one of the Kouachis had called each other more than 500 times last year. Gallery: From Car Chase To Last Stand Two brothers suspected of killing 12 people at the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris have been killed. They had earlier taken one person hostage as police cornered the gunmen in the area, northeast of Paris They have subsequently established that Cherif Kouachi met Coulibaly in prison and the two men visited jihadist Djamel Beghal with their wives in 2010. Coulibaly said he targeted the kosher supermarket because he wanted to defend Palestinians and target Jews. Witnesses to the Charlie Hebdo attack said Said Kouachi, the elder of the brothers, claimed allegiance to al Qaeda during the attack and travelled to Yemen in 2011. Gallery: Commandos Storm Supermarket Commandos stormed the kosher supermarket where a gunman had taken at least six people hostage. Pic: Vantage News His brother told BFMTV in a separate recording: ""I was sent, me, Cherif Kouachi, by Al Qaeda of Yemen. I went over there and it was Anwar al Awlaki who financed me."" Boumeddiene, 26, who was identified along with Coulibaly as a suspect in the killing of a police officer on Thursday, remains on the run. Mr Valls said the heavy death toll over three days of violence showed there had been a ""clear failing"" of intelligence. :: Watch Sky News Special Report: Paris Attack at 4.30pm and 8.30pm.

In Scotland, where record-breaking winds of 113mph were recorded on Friday, an estimated 40,000 homes are still without power, and Red Cross volunteers have been working to help the most vulnerable.  All of its supporters are on standby to offer assistance, with gas heaters, hot food and flasks of tea and coffee being distributed to those currently cut off from the grid. According to engineers, ""treacherous and worsening conditions"" have made restoring electricity even more challenging. The Forth Road Bridge was temporarily closed after a van was blown over There was also major disruption to travel services. Although several lines throughout Scotland have reopened, many remain closed as railway workers repair overhead wires, assess bridges and remove fallen trees from lines.  On the roads, two people received hospital treatment after their car collided with a gritter in South Ayrshire, and one person died following on from a crash in Aberdeenshire. Meanwhile, the recovery operation for the beached Hoegh Osaka on the Solent has been postponed owing to high winds - and in Brighton, two young men are feared dead after being dared to stand at the water's edge. The ferocious gales have been stirred up by an extra-powerful jet stream triggered by plunging temperatures in the US hitting warmer air in the South. Forecasters said they will be accompanied by snow with yellow ""be prepared"" weather alerts in place for all of Scotland, the North and Midlands of England, Wales and Northern Ireland"

It could be David Cameron's fundamental problem for 2015.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150114075230/http://news.sky.com/story/1406455/have-voters-got-deficit-attention-syndrome,"""Forgetting the deficit"" was Ed Miliband's nightmare of 2014. It could be David Cameron's fundamental problem for 2015. The public finances will not be omitted from the PM’s election oratories, but the electorate itself may be suffering from so-called deficit attention syndrome. So that is why the first of David Cameron's election pledges was revealed today as ""Britain living within its means"". To use the internal Conservative jargon, Mr Cameron needs to operationalise - rather than weaponise - the deficit. But first he needs to get them to remember it, as he said today: ""This is not some abstract economic debate."" Ed Miliband forgot to mention the deficit in his conference speech In 2010 the backdrop of the Eurozone financial crisis and the banking crash ensured that fiscal matters were at the front of voters' minds. Now, not as much. Other issues such as immigration and the NHS have shot up the list of voter priorities as the crisis has lessened. So, today, the PM revealed five commitments on the public finances: Getting to a surplus, cutting spending, cutting welfare, cracking down on tax avoidance and funding the NHS. Labour last month promised to cut the deficit every year, excluding capital spending, and for no extra borrowing to arise from its manifesto. Mr Cameron said: ""On the ballot paper is a choice between competence and chaos… security and insecurity… between a strong team that is turning our country around – or the people who got us into the mess in the first place."" Labour believe the Autumn Statement was an 'election-losing mistake' That is a strong message for the electorate, even if proclaiming competence is hardly visionary stuff. It plays on the lessons learnt from the Scottish referendum. The role of economic risk in the minds of mainly middle class voters in the last days of a campaign. But, is the electorate more concerned about the prospect of prolonged spending cuts? At the top of the Labour Party they claim that the Conservatives made an ""election-losing"" mistake at the Autumn Statement, in implying very large levels of cuts to public spending. It has crystallised and consolidated Labour's support. On the ground with public sector worker households, Labour can now point to specific official Government charts that are consistent with a world of further pay and pension restraint. The Liberal Democrat minister David Laws echoed some of this, by describing the Autumn Statement numbers as ""a very right-wing suicide note"". So the question is this: Do voters feel that further spending cuts will undermine public services, and is that a price worth paying for less of a risk of economic chaos? Is there actually a constituency for a surplus? That argument is far easier to ""operationalise"" in the context of an economic crisis. The wider problem for the Conservatives is that it is focusing solely on Government debts. The bomb defused by the coalition is little understood, but importantly different: a combination of large Government debts and huge banking debts. It is those two things, alongside indebted consumers, that created the real risks for Britain in 2010. Both could be pinned, electorally-speaking, on Labour. The combination of the two is no longer an acute problem. But that has bred fiscal amnesia. The Conservatives might actually prefer a sense of crisis."

All in an attempt to block or monitor returning British nationals from Syria and Iraq, which if radicalised could pose a threat to the UK. But given events in Paris this week, politicians here are asking if more should and can be done. Specifically if attempts should be made to bring back the Communication's Data Bill, or the so-called snooper's charter. The security services have repeatedly argued that communication between terrorists and their ability to intercept them is key to stopping any attacks. Attempts to extend those powers were blocked earlier in the Parliament by Nick Clegg. The Liberal Democrat leader warned it would allow the intelligence agencies to access records of every website people visit and social media communication people send. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg was against the 'snooper's charter' An infringement of the very liberties, they are seeking to defend. The Conservatives this week have hinted they do now want to look at it again, the Chancellor George Osborne on Friday said he would give the security services 'all the resources and all the legislation' they need. The Prime Minister, who is due to meet security chiefs on Monday, said in Paris: ""That means maintaining strong security, investing in our security services, it means being very vigilant."" Ed Miliband, however, said he would be ""cautious and considered"" as prime minister about requests for increased funding for security and intelligence agencies to support further surveillance of terror suspects. What is certain, is with continued Lib Dem opposition, the Communications Data Bill will not become law this Parliament and without a Conservative majority, is unlikely in the next. Though the age old debate of the balance between individual responsibility and collective security has again been ignited at Westminster."
2015-01-14,The latest batch of bleak A&E statistics strongly suggests the lack of social care beds is clogging up hospitals.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150114075230/http://news.sky.com/story/1404936/a-and-e-crisis-more-patients-not-to-blame,"The latest batch of bleak A&E statistics strongly suggests the lack of social care beds is clogging up hospitals. The headline figure - just 86.7% of patients dealt with in the target time of four hours (week ending 4 January) - is the worst since weekly data collection began in 2010. But the number of patients going to A&E wasn't exceptionally high last week - 50,000 below the peak. So it's not high demand that lies behind these figures. Dig deeper into the data and the real reason becomes clear. Gallery: When Should You Go To A&E? Unresponsive - Loss of consciousness More than 16,000 patients waited for at least four hours on a trolley even AFTER doctors had decided they were sick enough to be admitted to hospital. And 241 patients waited more than 12 hours. The comparable figures for the same week last year were just over 5,000 patients waiting more than four hours and 24 waiting more than 12 hours. So a dramatic rise in trolley waits. Hospitals are simply full. There is nowhere for the new arrivals to go. As Sky News has reported - based on other NHS England statistics - there are record numbers of hospital beds 'blocked' by healthy patients who can't be discharged because there are no care beds for them in the community. Local authority budgets have been severely cut in recent years - and they don't 'buy' enough care home places. So elderly patients are left in hospital beds that they don't need. And emergency patients can't be admitted. It is a serious situation. And the Government needs to get on top of it."

Confirming an exclusive report on Sky News, Morrisons said that Dalton Philips would leave the company following its full-year results, with a search under way for his successor. News of the change came as Morrisons reported Christmas trading figures which underlined its status as the also-ran among the big UK supermarket chains, with a like-for-like sales fall for the six weeks to January 4 of 5.2% including fuel. Mr Philips said he would be leaving ""a great company"", adding that during his five-year tenure ""many improvements (have been made) to the business and given Morrisons strong foundations for the future"". Morrisons also confirmed that Andrew Higginson, a former Tesco executive, would take over as its chairman from Sir Ian Gibson in January. Mr Higginson said: ""In the next chapter of Morrisons development, we need to return the business to growth. The board believes this is best done under new leadership. I would like to thank Dalton for his contribution as CEO.  ""He has brought great personal qualities and values to his leadership of the business, having had to manage against a background of considerable industry turmoil and change."" Mr Philips deserved ""particular credit for facing into and dealing with the pricing issues that have now become evident, for taking the business into the convenience and online channels, and for the steps he has taken to modernise the company's operating systems,"" Mr Higginson added. Morrisons' like-for-like trading performance was worse than the City had forecast, and placed the company firmly in the foothills of the battle for growth, with J Sainsbury and Tesco both reporting superior figures last week. Mr Philips, a former executive at Loblaw, Canada's biggest food retailer, became Morrisons' boss in March 2010, and also sits on the board of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. During his tenure, Morrisons has struggled to modernise its business in the face of tough competition from supermarket discounters and established rivals. Last autumn, Morrisons announced thousands of job cuts and the introduction of a new loyalty scheme in a bid to stem the decline in sales. When asked about Mr Philips' departure on Monday night, Morrisons said it did not comment on management changes."

There will be widespread showers through Tuesday night, bringing the risk of sleet and snow just about anywhere, although coastal areas will see mostly rain. Heavy snow will fall through the Central Belt, Fife and Perth and Kinross, with 10cm (4ins) or more over the highest ground. Elsewhere, a covering of snow is possible, even over the higher ground in southern England, whilst 2-5cm (2ins) is likely above 100m (330ft). A widespread frost will bring the risk of icy stretches on untreated surfaces by dawn. The showers, lying snow and ice will bring some difficult travelling conditions for the morning rush hour. The wintry showers will largely become confined to Scotland through Wednesday morning. Most other places will be dry and sunny by midday, but the far west of the Republic will turn increasingly wet and windy. A deepening area of low pressure will bring wind and rain eastwards into western Britain through Wednesday afternoon, preceded by a spell of snow over the higher ground of Northern Ireland, northern England and Scotland. The heavy rain will bring the risk of flooding, as well as standing water and spray on the roads. During Wednesday afternoon gusts of 50-65mph will develop widely, with 70mph likely around exposed coasts and hills. The heavy rain will spread to all parts overnight into Thursday and the winds will strengthen further. The very strong winds will last for much of Thursday, bringing the risk of disruption to transport and power supplies, some structural damage, as well as dangerously large waves around the coasts."

The 19-year-old computer engineer calmly went on give his story, even interrupting the operator when she questioned him so he could finish his point. ""My friend and I got into an altercation and I'm the only one who came out alive,"" he said Daynes claimed his 14-year-old victim had ""picked up a pen-knife and lost control"", leaving him with no choice but to act in self-defence. Breck Bednar, 14, had seen online gaming as a way to make new friends During the phone call, he calmly said: ""I put my arm up to block him from stabbing me and got him to the ground. He got up, I stabbed him once in the back of the neck, I believe somewhere near the brain stem. ""The fight ended with me cutting his throat. He fell face first on my bed. I tried to stop the bleeding, he fell on the floor. His throat was properly cut."" Gallery: Video Game Murder Evidence Released On the day Breck Bednar was visiting Lewis Daynes, the killer suggested that he lied to his parents about where he was going, and emailed an elaborate cover story Daynes was jailed for a minimum of 25 years for the murder on Monday. Two months before Breck was murdered, his mother had called the police, concerned that her teenage son was being ""increasingly controlled"" online. Although she was aware of Daynes she did not know he had been investigated by police for rape and attempted rape against a 15-year-old victim in 2011 - allegations which were later dropped. Emails released by Essex Police show Daynes to be a ""manipulative individual"" who promised Breck would ""never have to worry about financial security"" if he did research about computing on a school holiday in Spain, with promises of an £85m payment once they had met up. He had also told Breck to tell his father that he was going to meet a 14-year-old friend who used to go to his high school, following months of messages persuading Breck to distance himself from loved ones. ""In casual conversation to have your father afford more support to you, just say 'I've spent too many half-terms and holidays indoors, I'm going to spend this one outside with friends'. That should allow you to go,"" Daynes wrote in an email. Daynes had submerged computer equipment in water by the time police arrived at his flat, in a bid to conceal evidence. Detective Inspector Anne Cameron said: ""He used his substantial computer expertise and his knowledge of the world of social media to control everyone he came into contact with in his virtual world. ""He controlled access to this world jealously and spent a great deal of time building up his online persona - pretending to be an entrepreneur in order to influence, coerce and control vulnerable teenage boys to exploit them."" ""Breck Bednar was an innocent 14-year-old boy who had placed his trust in a man he considered to be a friend. Daynes abused that trust in the most horrific way possible, and has shown no remorse."""

Schools are reaching a ""tipping point"" and will struggle to find space for almost a million more pupils over the next decade, according to the Local Government Association (LGA). It cautions that in some areas there will be neither the money nor the space to expand, and said its analysis had shown it will cost £12bn to create enough places for the extra 900,000 pupils. However, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan accused the association, which represents local councils, of ""worrying"" parents as they apply for primary school places. One in eight fail to get the primary school of their choice The deadline for school applications is 15 January and already thousands of parents will be unable to get their child into the school they want. The most recent figures from the Department for Education show that one in eight children will fail to get a place in the primary school of their choice. Mrs Morgan said intensifying pressure on school places was due to an increase in birth rate but said £5bn had been invested in extra spaces in this parliament and £7bn was being invested between now and 2021. She told Sky News there would never come a time where schools could not accommodate children because ""local authorities have a statutory duty to provide school places for every child."" Mrs Morgan said: ""I think it's unfortunate that the Local Government Association is choosing to worry parents at this stage."" David Simmonds says councils simply cannot afford to expand schools Overcrowded schools across the country have been forced to build playgrounds on roofs after outside space was used to accommodate temporary classrooms. Some are teaching in church halls and even double-decker buses. However, the head of the LGA said the problem could not be solved at a local level. David Simmonds, chairman of the LGA's children and young people board, said: ""Mums and dads rightly expect their children to be able to get a school place and councils and schools are doing everything they can to provide this, in some cases going to extraordinary lengths to create places. ""But we fear a tipping point could soon emerge when councils and schools can no longer afford the massive costs for the creation of places, nor find the space necessary for new classes, if this crisis is not properly dealt with."" The LGA has warned that in some areas this year there will be two pupils fighting for every school place. Conservative Education Minister Nick Gibb blamed the last Labour government for failing to plan for the future."

David Cameron met intelligence and security chiefs to discuss whether further measures are needed to deal with the threat of terror attacks in Britain after 17 people were killed in the French capital. A Number 10 spokesman confirmed it had been agreed that future exercises, which take place on a regular basis, should seek to learn from events in France. Mr Cameron, who joined French President Francois Hollande and world leaders for a rally in Paris to remember the victims, stressed the need for the police to be able to call on military help if there was a major emergency. The PM also emphasised the importance of international co-operation to stop the cross-border smuggling of firearms and other weapons. He later vowed to legislate to deny terrorists a ""safe space"" in which to communicate. Speaking at an event in Nottingham, he said: ""The next government will have to legislate again in 2016. ""If I am prime minister, I will make sure that it is a comprehensive piece of legislation that makes sure we do not allow terrorists safe space to communicate with each other. ""That is the key principle: do we allow safe spaces for them to talk to each other? I say no, we don't, and we should legislate accordingly."" Gallery: France Attacks: Marches Worldwide London's Tower Bridge is illuminated by the red, white and blue of the French Tricolore in solidarity with the people of France Speaking to Sky News following the march, Mr Cameron said it was necessary to ""ask ourselves how we would respond to this sort of situation"" in Britain. The attacks have also sparked a debate about whether UK police officers should be routinely armed. Norman Brennan, a retired police officer, told Sky News: ""It's not really a choice of whether police officers, certainly frontline officers, want to be armed. The time has really come where they should be armed. ""When you think only 3% of police officers across the UK are actually armed, and not all of them will be on duty at one particular time, Britain is not prepared for a terrorist attack."" Plans for a new communications data bill in the UK were previously blocked by the Liberal Democrats, but the Conservatives have signalled that they will revive the legislation if they win the general election. Civil liberties campaigners have warned against any attempt to use the Charlie Hebdo attack as a pretext for introducing further surveillance powers in Britain. Big Brother Watch director Emma Carr said: ""It is wholly unacceptable for this tragedy in Paris to be used as a means to call for a return of the snooper's charter."" Labour leader Ed Miliband said any move to grant security agencies more powers and resources to track suspects should be ""cautious and considered"". London Mayor Boris Johnson said those who pose a threat to Britain should be monitored by security agencies. ""I'm not particularly interested in all this civil liberties stuff when it comes to these people's emails and mobile phone conversations,"" he said. ""If they're a threat to our society then I want them properly listened to."""

Nick Clegg said it was important for the UK to make clear it did not approve of the ""profoundly illiberal, draconian"" sentence passed on Raif Badawi. Badawi was sentenced to 1,000 lashes – 50 in 20 weekly sessions – for criticising Saudi Arabian clerics on a forum he founded in 2008. The first of the public floggings was dished out in the Red Sea city of Jeddah on Friday, the days after the Charlie Hebdo attacks on the satirical magazine, which has been critical of Islam. Two days later Saudi officials attended the march in Paris and stood alongside leaders to condemn the atrocity. Clegg: values of Britain and Saudi Arabia are very different Mr Clegg surprisingly said he was not aware of the individual case, which has received significant publicity worldwide, but added that it was ""a profoundly, illiberal draconian way to deal with someone who is expressing opinions who may not be agreed with by the Saudi regime but which nonetheless are reasonably held and reasonably expressed."" The told Radio 4's Today programme: ""We always have a tension in our dealings with countries where we must deal with them, because there are issues of national interest at stake in doing so, not least security, but clearly where our values are not similar at all. ""And to put it mildly, the values of our country and of Saudi Arabia are very different indeed. ""We need to be open about those differences and absolutely not shirk from expressing them, for instance in this case as well, but not necessarily pulling up the drawbridge to all cooperation. That wouldn't serve our interests either."" US officials have called for the sentence – which also includes a 10-year prison term – to be withdrawn and for the case to be reviewed. Saudi Arabia is one of five Arab countries in the US-led coalition fighting Islamic State. On  Friday, a witness described to Amnesty International how Badawi was beaten. They said: ""A security officer approached him from behind with a huge cane and started beating him. Raif raised his head towards the sky, closing his eyes and arching his back. ""He was silent, but you could tell from his face and his body that he was in real pain. The officer beat Raif on his back and legs, counting the lashes until they reached 50."" Amnesty has condemned the flogging. Amnesty International UK’s Head of Policy and Government Affairs Allan Hogarth said: ""Given the international outcry over the flogging of Raif Badawi last week, it’s a little disappointing that Nick Clegg wasn't already aware of the case. ""However the important thing now is that the deputy prime minister - and indeed the UK government more generally - puts some real pressure on the Saudi authorities to suspend this cruel punishment ahead of Friday and indeed to release Badawi from prison."""

France is mobilising 10,000 troops to boost security after the deadly attacks. Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said troops would be in place from Tuesday evening in sensitive areas. Meanwhile, the hunt continues for what the French prime minister called a ""probably accomplice"" to the three days of bloodshed in the capital. Manuel Valls said the search is urgent because ""the threat is still present"" after the attacks. French police said the weapons used by the terror cell that terrorised Paris came from outside the country and that authorities were tracing the source of the financing."
2015-01-14,How low is too low? That's the question economists are asking today after the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rate dropped from 1% to 0.5%.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150114075230/http://news.sky.com/story/1407096/why-record-inflation-fall-is-not-all-good-news,"How low is too low? That's the question economists are asking today after the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rate dropped from 1% to 0.5%. It's the lowest official inflation number for a decade-and-a-half, and the first time it has halved in the space of a month. Moreover, with oil prices continuing to fall – now below $50 a barrel on the Brent crude international measure – the likelihood is that the CPI will only continue to fall. At the very least it will drop to the lowest level since comparable records began in 1989. It may even drop into negative territory. Should consumers be concerned? No. In the short term, this fall is good news – the equivalent of a tax cut for most consumers. In fact, according to calculations by Capital Economics, the fall in petrol prices alone should put £455 back into the average household's pockets. The fact that lower energy prices also push down a host of other costs should continue the 'tax cut' in coming months. Moreover, with inflation at 0.5% it is now comfortably below the rate at which wages are increasing (1.6%, excluding bonuses) – so the longest squeeze on living standards since Victorian times is now at an end. Finally, because inflation is well below the Bank of England's 2% target, it is even less likely to raise interest rates in the near future. Market expectations for the date of a rate increase have now shifted from this summer to next spring. And the expected level in five years is now 1.4%, compared with 2% expected a couple of months ago. That means more impetus for consumer spending in the coming months and, perhaps, an even stronger recovery later this year (though the near-term turbulence in Russia and elsewhere caused by falling oil prices might weigh on growth in the immediate future). However, it's not all good news. There is good deflation and bad deflation. Good deflation, of the kind depicted above, is a temporary cut in prices – a temporary boost to consumers' real incomes. No one changes their behaviour or spends less as a result – quite the contrary. Bad deflation is the kind witnessed in the US in the 1930s when prices fell for a prolonged period of time along with wages. Because this deflation lasts longer, and is associated with weaker growth, it is trickier to shake off. There are serious concerns this kind of deflation is taking hold in Europe – quite apart from recent oil-led falls. Indeed, in certain countries, such as Greece, this 1930s-style deflation is already quite evident. Prices are now falling across the Eurozone, and if economists' forecasts are to be believed, they could stay low for some time. That's why the European Central Bank looks likely to engage in full-blown quantitative easing either this month or soon afterwards. The only question is quite how it has managed to structure the programme so it doesn't fall foul of the inflation hawks at the Bundesbank."

Lilian Lepere was working at a print company in Dammartin-en-Goele when Cherif and Said Kouachi laid siege to the building after killing 12 people in Paris. The 27-year-old broke down in tears while recounting his ordeal to French television station France 2; the first interview he has given since the drama ended. Mr Lepere was rescued after police stormed the printing company ""One of (the brothers) came and opened a cupboard next to mine,"" he said. ""Inside he found nothing interesting to him. Then he went towards the fridge. ""He asked his accomplice if he wanted to drink something and he responded 'No, and this isn't a time for that'. ""I thought that… if he is looking for something, for food supplies, he will look through all the cupboards. ""So he went towards the fridge and came back towards the place I was hidden in and he drinks (some water) just over my head. ""He was drinking just above me. I could hear water flowing just over my head, because my head is next to the washbasin. I can see his shadow through the opening between doors. ""I moved a little bit. My back was stuck against the pipe which was leaking. I felt water flowing; a surreal moment, completely surreal, and I said to myself 'it's like in a film. We only see that in films'. ""The brain stops thinking, heart stops beating, breath is stopped and you wait, because that is the only thing you can do."" The print firm's boss Michel Catalano told Mr Lepere to hide in the back of the building when he saw the gunmen arriving, allowing him to feed vital information to the police. Despite hardly being able to move in the confined space, Mr Lepere described the moment he reached for his mobile phone and texted his mother who contacted police. ""It's not big. Imagine something like 70 cm by 90 cm and approximately 50 cm deep. If you move on one side you might open the door and on the other you hit the wall. So you don't move. ""At some point I told myself I should go for it, even if it makes a noise. Phones were ringing here and there in the company, so those noisy moments allowed me to move. ""I was saying that to myself to give me some hope. And after some time, after fifteen minutes, I was able to reach my mobile phone. ""At that point I knew I was in contact with the outside world and it was really good for morale. From that point everything was done between my phone and my mother's phone."" Mr Lepere's mother passed her phone to police who communicated with her son for the duration of the siege. It was through this series of text messages that police were able to coordinate their plan to begin the assault on the Kouachi brothers. ""(The police) were using only one phone to communicate (with me) and I was able to give them as much information as I could using my ears and feelings,"" he said. After eight hours, as night drew in, police launched their attack killing both brothers and ending three days of terror."

The man's unusual posture as he walked caught the attention of customs officers in the city of Shenzhen as he tried to cross into China from Hong Kong on Sunday night, China's state media reported Reports indicate he looked as though he was weighed down with something heavy, despite only holding two plastic bags. When the airport-style metal detector sounded as he passed through he was stopped and searched. Images released by Chinese officials revealed he had taped the unboxed phones to his body and legs. The stash contained iPhone 6, 6+ and the older iPhone 5 handsets.  iPhones are, on average, £80 cheaper in Hong Kong than they are in mainland China. High demand from Chinese consumers contributes to smuggling. Ironically, all iPhones are made in factories on the Chinese mainland, including one plant near the port where the seizure was made. The border between Hong Kong and mainland China is a notorious smuggling route. Electrical and luxury goods are often cheaper in Hong Kong than on the mainland.  Baby formula is also often smuggled because of ongoing fears on the mainland about the safety of Chinese-made formula."

The magazine is to publish its new edition with a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed on its front cover. Mohammed is depicted crying and holding a placard with the words ""I am Charlie"". Above him is the slogan ""All is Forgiven"". The Charlie Hebdo staff who put the issue together said they wanted Mohammed on the cover to show they would not ""cede"" to extremists wanting to silence them. Staff said they planned to print as many as three million copies of the magazine, the usual print run is 60,000.  Gerard Biard, editor-in-chief at Charlie Hebdo, said the new edition was produced “with pain and with joy”.  Staff said there was ""no doubt"" of the future of the magazine despite saying they would take a temporary break from publishing after the new issue. The new edition will be published in multiple languages including French, Spanish, Italian, English and Arabic and will be available on the shelves for two weeks. France has been shaken to its core by the bloodshed that began with a jihadist assault on the offices of the magazine on January 7 and ended in a deadly hostage drama at a Jewish supermarket two days later. Charlie Hebdo, which lampoons religion indiscriminately, had received threats after depicting Mohammed before, and its offices were firebombed in 2011. Seventeen people lost their lives in the wave of terrorist attacks across Paris last week."

Four hostages and Amedy Coulibaly were killed after he sparked a siege at a kosher supermarket in Paris. And Jewish neighbourhood watch group Shomrim, which has a total of around 80 volunteers, called for increased vigilance following the attacks. The organisation's Twitter account said: ""Following events in #Paris we will have on extra patrols throughout NW London over Shabbos. We ask the community to remain calm & vigilant. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the Jewish community in #Paris, the victims and families of victims in today's attacks."" Gallery: Commandos Storm Supermarket Pic: @conflictnews Shomrim London covers areas of the capital with large Jewish populations, including Golders Green, Hendon and Barnet. Hackney Metropolitan Police's Twitter account, @MPSHackney, was asked why Shomrim was allowed to use cars with markings so similar to police cars. ""We are supportive of work Shomrim do but they don't need us to 'allow' them to mark a car up this way, it's a matter for them,"" it said. ""Think the word 'Shomrim' in big letters down all sides is fairly unambiguous!"" Asked if other minority groups would be permitted to run their own patrols in similar vehicles, the HackneyMPS account said: ""Citizens/communities in London can do whatever they wish as long as within the law - not for police to 'allow' or 'forbid'."" Shomrim declined to comment on the extra patrols, but issued a statement to Sky News saying its patrol vehicle was ""clearly marked with large lettering with the name of our charity, on all four sides so as not to impersonate police in any way. ""We are not a police force. ""Our unpaid volunteers and unpaid staff are compiled of men and women of the local neighbourhood regardless of their ethnicity or religious affiliation."""

The country's second-largest department store chain said UK like-for-like sales fell 0.8% in the 19 weeks to 10 January. However the firm, which has 240 stores and trades across 28 countries, said that over the four weeks to 10 January underlying sales were up 4.9%, with revenues boosted by less discounting and an improved online delivery offer. Debenhams said trading was at record levels over Christmas week. Chief executive Michael Sharp said: ""I am pleased with our performance in the critical Christmas trading weeks, driven by our strength in a diverse range of product categories and a strong marketing campaign focussed on gifting. ""Our performance steadily improved following the well documented challenges in the clothing market in the autumn. ""We now have a competitive online proposition with next day delivery to home and next day click and collect, which customers took full advantage of and which performed well over Christmas. ""I would like to thank the whole Debenhams team for their tremendous efforts in delivering this performance."" Shareholders did not seem to agree that the trading update was positive, with Debenhams' value down 9% in early trading. The announcement was made as figures compiled by the British Retail Consortium showed the industry suffered its slowest December growth in six years. The body blamed a Black Friday spending rush in November for disrupting the ""timing and rhythm"" of Christmas sales. Among other retailers reporting Christmas trading updates on Tuesday was ASOS, the online fashion specialist. It said there was a 15% increase in like-for-like sales for the six weeks to 9 January - helping its share price grow 12% when the market opened following a tough 2014 that saw it hit by a damaging warehouse fire. Greggs, the bakers, raised its full-year profit guidance while reporting an 8.1% rise in like-for-like sales for the five weeks to 3 January. Its share price rose 6% when trading began."

NHS England said 25 treatments have been removed from the Cancer Drugs Fund in an effort to save £80m. But cancer charities warned patients will die sooner because they will be denied access to innovative treatments. The fund, which currently has a budget of £280m, has been used by 55,000 patients since it was set up in 2010. But costs have spiralled and the fund was expected to be £100m over budget by the end of the financial year. Prof Peter Clark, chair of the fund and a cancer specialist, said: ""There were drugs that did not offer sufficient clinical benefit so we simply cannot go on funding those. ""These are difficult decisions, but if we don't prioritise the drugs that offer the best value, many people could miss out on promising, more effective treatments that are in the pipeline."" Patients already receiving drugs through the fund will be allowed to continue treatment. But Mark Flannagan, chief executive of the charity Beating Bowel Cancer, said: ""This is bad news for bowel cancer patients. ""It's likely that 65% of patients with advanced bowel cancer face the probability of an earlier death by being refused innovative treatments that were available before. ""These changes are a backward step in treatment for advanced bowel cancer. ""Doctors will be forced to tell their patients there are treatments that can prolong their lives but they will no longer be available."" The fund was announced by the Prime Minister David Cameron as a way of giving patients access to treatments that had been rejected by NICE, the NHS health adviser. But health economists argue it undermines the role of NICE in ensuring NHS money is spent wisely. Prof Karl Claxton, of York University, said the fund would have saved many more lives and had a greater health benefit if it had been spent on other diseases. He said: ""The real beneficiaries of the Cancer Drugs Fund are not patients. ""It's the manufacturers that have been able to continue to sell drugs at prices that don't reflect what the NHS can afford for the benefits they offer. ""It has made it harder to negotiate realistic prices for the NHS."""
2015-01-14,New video has emerged of the Paris gunmen on the streets of the city after carrying out their attack on Charlie Hebdo last week.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20150114075230/http://news.sky.com/story/1407227/new-footage-of-charlie-hebdo-gun-attack,"New video has emerged of the Paris gunmen on the streets of the city after carrying out their attack on Charlie Hebdo last week. The footage shows the two masked figures calmly returning to their getaway vehicle after murdering staff at the satirical magazine. The pair reload their weapons, before one shouts: ""We have avenged the Prophet Mohammed, we have killed Charlie Hebdo."" It then shows the gunmen firing on a police car as they made their escape. The vehicle, lights flashing, is forced to reverse at speed as the killers get out of their own car, aim their weapons and open fire. The fundamentalist brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi killed 12 people in last Wednesday's deadly attack on Charlie Hebdo, including two policemen. One of the officers was shot at point-blank range as he lay wounded on the ground. Their accomplice, Amedy Coulibaly, gunned down a police officer before killing four people in a Jewish supermarket in the French capital. All three died in shoot-outs with police on Friday. Gallery: Funerals For Paris Attacks Victims Police officers carry the coffins draped in the French flag of the three police officers killed in the recent terror attacks in Paris, at the city's police headquarters In the wake of the atrocities, France's Prime Minister has announced he would seek tighter surveillance of convicted extremists, amid reports the weapons used to kill 17 people came from outside the country. Manuel Valls said ""serious and very high risks remain"" and warned the French not to let down their guard. Christophe Crepin, a French police union representative, said several people were being sought in connection with the ""substantial"" financing of the attacks. The funding and logistics involved indicated an organised network, he said. French police say as many as six members of the terror cell behind the attacks may still be at large The Bulgarian authorities said they had arrested a French citizen, Fritz-Joly Joachin, believed to have links to one of the Kouachi brothers. Meanwhile, funerals have taken place in Paris and Jerusalem for some of the 17 killed in the terror attacks, including the three murdered police officers. And the magazine targeted by the terrorists is preparing for its biggest ever print run of its special 'survivor's edition'. Three million copies will be printed of the latest issue, which will have a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed on its front cover. Charlie Hebdo staff said they wanted to show they would not ""cede"" to extremists trying to silence them. The head of Europol has warned up to 5,000 EU nationals pose a potential terrorist threat to Europe after travelling overseas to countries like Syria."

Lewis Daynes, 19, befriended Breck Bednar over the internet and lured him to a property in Essex. It is believed the computer engineer had bound Breck's wrists and ankles with duct tape before stabbing him in the neck. Following the killing, Daynes took pictures of his victim's body and sent them to online acquaintances before calling police. Breck was an air cadet with 135 Squadron and a student at St Bede's school The judge, Mrs Justice Cox, said she was ""sure this murder was driven by sexual and sadistic motivation"", adding that Daynes had ""groomed this boy over a lengthy period of time"" and had ""intended to kill him"". Two months before Breck died, his mother, Lorin LaFave, had called Surrey Police - concerned over Daynes's increasingly controlling online behaviour. The family has now lodged a complaint with the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Gallery: Video Game Murder Evidence Released On the day Breck Bednar was visiting Lewis Daynes, the killer suggested that he lied to his parents about where he was going, and emailed an elaborate cover story In a statement outside Chelmsford Crown Court, the Crown Prosecution Service added: ""Lewis Daynes, even though he was only 18 when he committed Breck's murder, was a controlling and manipulative individual who carefully planned this crime. ""He groomed Breck online using their shared interest in computer games and over a period of months he manipulated Breck, turning him against his family. ""The degree of planning and manipulation by Daynes is shocking and when you consider the young ages of perpetrator and victim, it stands out as one of the most cruel, violent and unusual cases we have dealt with."" After sentencing, it emerged that Daynes had faced previous allegations of rape and attempted rape in 2011, but officers investigating the case decided not to take further action. Following his arrest for Breck's murder, Daynes said to officers: ""I should have known better than to go for an artery on a friend."" In the days after Breck's death, a person claiming to be his cousin posted a message on Facebook saying he had gone on to the web after struggling to make friends. Daynes, who went by the online name EagleOneSix, had promised Breck ""great wealth"" through a fictional computer software business. Breck's mother, Lorin LaFave, said she was ""heartbroken and lost"" by her son's death, adding the emotional impact had affected her hearing, her sense of smell and her eyesight. Ms LaFaye said she felt ""weakened from this horrible tragedy"" but wanted to warn others of the dangers of online predators and save others from ""the pure evil in this world"". More follows..."

More than 250 viewers complained to Ofcom after former Coronation Street star Ken Morley clashed with housemates and was evicted for using ""unacceptable language"", including a word considered racially offensive. The soap actor, who played Reg Holdsworth, had repeatedly said the word ""negro"". He became the second contestant to be removed less than a week after the Channel 5 show began. Former Baywatch star Jeremy Jackson, 34, was kicked off the show after former Page 3 girl Chloe Goodman, 21, claimed he drunkenly tried to look at her breasts while the pair were alone in the toilet. Jackson has been given a police caution Hertfordshire Police, the force covering Borehamwood where the show is filmed, said: ""A 34-year-old man voluntarily attended Hatfield police station on January 12 to assist police with their inquiries into an incident which is alleged to have taken place in the Big Brother House in Borehamwood in the early hours of Saturday January 10. ""The man has subsequently been issued with a police caution for common assault."" The force confirmed it had not received any complaints about Morley's behaviour. Morley has apologised ""unreservedly"" for his behaviour but denied he was racist. He told ITV's Loose Women: ""I apologise unreservedly to everybody who watched that programme. ""It was banter in an odd situation, but I understand entirely I've upset a lot of people."" Viewers have also complained about Jackson's behaviour and some of the language used by Katie Hopkins. The show has a history of causing controversy and last year's series was the second most complained-about show of the year, with 1,874 people contacting the watchdog about it. The only programme with a worse record was the main Big Brother series which received 3,784 complaints, many of them centred on the behaviour of its eventual winner, Helen Wood, who was accused of bullying other contestants. The show's lowest point came in 2007, while it was still on its original home of Channel 4, when around 40,000 people complained after a race row engulfed the celebrity version of the show. The aggressive verbal exchanges between Jade Goody and Bollywood star Shilpa Shetty even reached the world of politics, with then-chancellor Gordon Brown forced to address the issue during a visit to India after protesters burned effigies of the show's producers."

The company said the decision, coupled with a new one-year fixed dual fuel product it was also launching, represented a ""risk"" given Labour's pledge to introduce an energy price freeze should the party win May's election. It insisted it had passed on to customers as much as it could, with wholesale costs having plunged by around 30% in the past year. E.ON said the average reduction to its standard gas price was equivalent to two weeks' gas use or £24 off an annual gas bill. The household supplier, which has 4.5 million residential customers, claimed the fixed product was the best on offer in the market at an average £923 annually and was available from today, saying it was open to new and existing customers. Chief executive Tony Cocker said: ""Today's 3.5% cut to our standard gas price and the launch of the UK's cheapest energy tariff, our one year fixed product, demonstrate that we fundamentally believe in doing the right thing for our customers. ""This is further evidenced by the fact we are the first supplier to reflect through our standard tariff the overall drop in wholesale gas prices this winter but also that, when our prices had to increase at the start of 2014 to reflect cost increases, for the second year running we announced later than any other major supplier and, on that occasion, at a lower average percentage increase level than any other major supplier. ""While oil prices have slumped, the gas price has remained volatile - some days up, some days down - and many of the other non-energy costs that we don't control but make up a customer's bill have increased and are set to increase further. ""However, today we've taken steps so we can make a price cut on our standard gas tariff at the same time as offering customers, existing and new, the chance to sign up to the UK's lowest priced energy tariff. ""As we have always said where it is possible we will try to pass savings on to our customers."" Wholesale gas costs fell 26% between the third quarter of 2013 and and the same period in 2014 and have fallen further since. Sky News reported at the weekend that firms were reluctant to slash standard bills before May, given the fact that raw energy had been purchased at higher prices over years to ensure supply and the prospect of a looming price freeze."

Mr Diamond noticed the flashing Mega Millions sign and decided to spend $10 for 10 sets of Quick Pick numbers. The winning ticket ""I put the ticket in my wallet and forgot about it,"" the new millionaire said in a statement released by New York Lottery. ""I went to play golf the next day and the guys in the clubhouse were talking about the jackpot-winning ticket someone bought at a Valero on Route 302, and I thought, wait a minute - I bought a ticket there last night!"" Mr Diamond, of Wurtsboro, New York, a village about 80 miles (129km) northwest of New York City, dashed home, checked his tickets and found he had the winner. ""I was in a dither, a real daze,"" said Mr Diamond, who retired as school principal in 1995. Mr Diamond, whose win dates to a drawing on 4 November, waited to cash in his ticket until after 1 January for tax reasons. It is the highest prize ever in New York Lottery history He opted to take a single lump sum payment, which comes to about $130m (£86m) after taxes. Plans for the money include helping family and ""giving back to the local community"", Mr Diamond said."
