2014-06-02,Harris Denies 'Deliberate Lie' To Sex Trial,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140602135027/http://news.sky.com/story/1273768/harris-denies-deliberate-lie-to-sex-trial,"By Nick Pisa, Sky News Reporter, at Southwark Crown Court Entertainer Rolf Harris has deliberately lied in his sex trial, jurors have been told, after new  video evidence was shown to the court. 
	Harris, 84, said last week he had never been to Cambridge - where an alleged assault took place - until four years ago for an exhibition of his paintings. 
	But evidence was shown to the court which showed him being in the university city in 1978, taking part in a programme called Star Games. 
	The trial has heard the alleged victim was around 14 when she claimed Harris touched her bottom when he took part in an It's a Knockout style event held in Cambridge. 
	In the footage seen by jurors Harris was described as being the captain of the theatre team as it took part in the game show, with prosecutor Sasha Wass QC saying he ""was jumping up and down like a kangaroo"". 
	His teammates included Dr Who star Colin Baker, actress Rula Lenska and seventies comedian Robin Askwith. 
	Ms Wass added the video ""supported everything the witness had said... apart from the year - she got that wrong"". 
	Ms Wass added: ""You told the jury last week with such confidence that you had never been to Cambridge until four years ago. That was a deliberate lie."" 
	Harris replied: ""No, it wasn't. I didn't find out it was Cambridge until I saw the video. 
	""None of the performers knew they were in Cambridge."" 
	The video began with aerial shots of Cambridge and was introduced by Michael Aspel welcoming viewers to the city. 
	After it was screened, Ms Wass said: ""You didn't know you were in Cambridge? Michael Aspel knew."" 
	Harris said: ""We all went on a coach and were deposited on a green with changing rooms."" 
	Ms Wass continued: ""You deliberately lied to mislead the jury."" 
	Harris said: ""I'd forgotten the event."" 
	Ms Wass said: ""It was a deliberate lie."" 
	Harris said: ""No, a lapse of memory."" 
	He again insisted that all of the women who have given evidence against him had lied. 
	At one point the judge rebuked Harris after he threw a question back at the prosecution, telling him: ""This is not a verbal joust."" 
	The artist's daughter Bindi Nicholls, 50, also gave evidence, telling how she was once ""best friends"" with the main complainant in the trial. 
	Mrs Nicholls told the court she had been delighted that the woman went on holiday with her and the Harris family in 1978.  
	When asked by defence QC Sonia Woodley if she had ever seen her friend ""looking flustered, or any change in her behaviour during the holiday,"" she replied she had not. 
	The woman has told the court she was groped by Harris as she stepped out of a shower and when he wrapped her in a towel on the beach during the trip. 
	Mrs Nicholls said of the alleged beach incident: ""That would be weird. You put a towel around little people not a grown teenager, they would dry themselves. 
	""That would be strange, odd. I can't see that happening at all."" 
	She added:""My dad doesn't like going on the beach. He hates sunbathing. He maybe goes snorkelling."" 
	When asked about claims from the main complainant that her father had performed a sex act on her friend as she was asleep on the next bed, Mrs Nicholls said that was ""laughable"" and ""ridiculous"". 
	She added she had never seen her friend as the depressed and broken woman she had told the court she became after Harris allegedly assaulted her. 
	Mrs Nicholls said: ""She always seemed very happy, jolly, alive."" 
	Earlier Mrs Nicholls had broken down in tears as she described as ""devastating"" the Harris family move from south London to Berkshire in 1981, adding that it was like ""moving to the moon"". 
	Harris denies 12 counts of indecent assault on four women aged between seven and eight years old and 19 between 1968 and 1986. 
	The trial continues."
2014-06-02,School 'Failed To Protect Pupils From Extremism',https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140602135027/http://news.sky.com/story/1273823/school-failed-to-protect-pupils-from-extremism,"A Birmingham school facing claims of an Islamist takeover plot has been found to have failed to protect children from extremism, Sky News has learned. 
	An Ofsted investigation said the school - which Sky News is not naming - is inadequate. 
	Its management has been strongly criticised by inspectors. 
	The report into this specific school follows allegations of a so-called ""Trojan Horse"" takeover by Muslim hardliners at more than 20 schools in the Midlands city. 
	It said the school's ""work to keep students safe is inadequate"". 
	The report went on: ""Key safeguarding procedures are not followed. Too little is done to keep students safe from the risks associated with extremist views. 
	""Some staff, including senior leaders, are concerned about a special perceived unfairness and lack of transparency in the recruitment process and the breadth and balance of the curriculum. 
	""Some female members of staff complained ... that at times they are spoken to in a manner which they find intimidating."" 
	It found the school's ""policies have been given scant consideration"" and its ""equalities policy is not fit for purpose"". 
	Sky's Lisa Dowd said: ""Other things mentioned in this report is that sex and relationship education is not adequate at the school. 
	""Students have a scant understanding of other religions, the focus is primarily on Islam. 
	""And, the school has been slow to engage in the prevent policy - a strategy funded by the Government to prevent extremism and radicalisation."" 
	A person connected to the school told Sky News they felt it was ""completely unfair"" and that Ofsted had picked up on historical incidents which had already been dealt with and that the education watchdog was ""going to get them by hook, or by crook"". 
	They feared they could all be branded Islamists and hardliners and the damning report could spark an exodus of teaching staff. 
	They insisted standards had been raised at the school in the last few months which was not reflected in the report, which said pupils behaved well and described them as being courteous, respectful and eager to learn. 
	Dowd added: ""Because this school has been rated inadequate it is likely to go into special measures. 
	""That could see the leadership of the school and the governing body being dissolved and replaced. 
	""And we understand that this won't be the only school that is rated inadequate when Ofsted publishes its findings into the 21 schools later on this week."" 
	Labour MP Khalid Mahmood told Sky News: ""There has been grooming, by a particular community, a school of thought within Islam, and would possibly lead to extremism ... not saying that children at school at the moment are extremist, but certainly they have been groomed in a particular way for that to be made easier at a later stage. 
	""That's what my concerns have been in Birmingham."""
2014-06-02,Hodgson In World Cup National Anthem Pledge,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140602135027/http://news.sky.com/story/1273606/hodgson-in-world-cup-national-anthem-pledge,"Manager Roy Hodgson has promised his England players will belt out the national anthem at the World Cup in Brazil. 
	England's footballers have been criticised for not singing God Save The Queen with as much passion as their compatriots in other sports, most notably rugby. 
	Wayne Rooney did not sing the national anthem at the start of his England career while Gary Neville, now an England coach, refused to join in. 
	He said he preferred ""focusing on the match"" instead. 
	But Hodgson, who has been England boss for two years, is adamant all his team should sing the anthem before kick-off. 
	""You very rarely play an international match against opponents and they haven't got their hands on their hearts and singing their anthem as loud as they can,"" he said. 
	""We've made a decision that that's what we're going to do, too, because we are proud, we are happy to be wearing that England shirt."" 
	As his 23-man squad contains 12 players who were not part of Euro 2012, Hodgson will remind them they must sing along this summer. 
	""Perhaps we need to remind them as the squad has changed so much,"" he said. 
	""I think we're great until the second verse comes along because we don't really know that."" 
	After warm-up games against Ecuador and Honduras in Miami this week, England will take on Italy in their World Cup opener in Manaus on June 14. 
	England's departure on Sunday was hit by a moment of farce when comedian Simon Brodkin gatecrashed the party as they arrived at Luton Airport. 
	Brodkin was pictured attempting to mingle with England's players and staff as they waited for the luggage to be removed from their coach. 
	Dressed in an identical suit to those worn by the England party, he spent several moments with them before being spotted by captain Steven Gerrard, at which point he was removed by security staff. 
	Meanwhile, the final test event has been held at the unfinished stadium which will host the World Cup opener between Brazil and Croatia on June 12. 
	Around 70,000 fans are expected at the Itaquerao in Sao Paulo but just 37,000 attended the trial match between Corinthians and Botafogo on Sunday. 
	Only one of the temporary stands added for the inaugural World Cup game could be used because of safety concerns. 
	There were no problems inside or outside the stadium, although the match was briefly interrupted after balloons released by fans made it onto the pitch."
2014-06-02,Madeleine McCann: UK Cops Search Scrubland,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140602135027/http://news.sky.com/story/1273546/madeleine-mccann-uk-cops-in-praia-da-luz,"By Tom Parmenter, Sky News Correspondent, in Praia da Luz British police teams have started a search of scrubland on the Algarve in their renewed investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. 
	A team of around 30 officers and police staff have travelled to Praia da Luz and began by unloading equipment and mapping out the four acre site. 
	The cordoned off area is a five-minute walk from the Ocean Club complex where Madeleine, who was three at the time, was staying with her family in May 2007. 
	Parents Gerry and Kate McCann will be kept updated but have not travelled to Portugal. 
	The agreement between the Metropolitan Police and their Portuguese counterparts is limited to one search area after the British team failed to get permission to search elsewhere in the resort. 
	It is understood they will use ground penetrating radar to identify any anomalies within the ground that may warrant further investigation with police dogs or physical digging. 
	Other potential search sites include another area of scrubland close to the McCanns' holiday apartment. 
	The land which had been earmarked for development is now fenced off but was an open area on the night Madeleine vanished. 
	Former Scotland Yard detective Peter Bleksley told Sky News the radar equipment likely to be used in the operation can detect if the ground has been disturbed as far back as seven years ago. 
	British expat residents in the town have confirmed they recently saw a military aircraft flying for long periods possibly conducting aerial reconnaissance. 
	The renewed activity by authorities has caused anger in the resort among expats and business owners who just want to move on. 
	One Dutch resident, called 'Nana', complained that the police and the press are back. 
	She told Sky News the timing of the search at the start of the tourist season was ""outrageous"" and doing ""tremendous"" damage to the town, adding: ""Luz is totally innocent."" 
	She also wore a sign around her neck, saying: ""Dig up the lies not Luz."" 
	'Nana' denied police were doing everything they could, saying ""they are on the wrong path"". 
	The publisher of the Portugal News newspaper Paul Luckman who lives nearby said the local police are co-operating with the British teams. 
	He said: ""They are going to do what is asked of them, they will do it professionally and properly...our information is that it will go on until the end of this week. 
	""I think realistically we have to say we have reached the end of the line here....there isn't anything left to do after this."""
2014-06-02,UK 'Summers Of Rain': Climate Change Warning,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140602135027/http://news.sky.com/story/1273489/uk-summers-of-rain-climate-change-warning,"Global warming could lead to more extreme bursts of summer downpours and increase the risk of flash flooding in Britain, experts have warned. 
	A study by the Met Office and Newcastle University has examined how climate change could result in heavier summer rainfall. 
	Published in the Nature and Climate Change journal, the report said: ""Short duration rain events are predicted to intensify during the summer months in the southern United Kingdom. 
	""This predicted increase means more events would exceed the Met Office and Environment Agency Flood Forecasting Centre guidance threshold for serious flash flooding."" 
	The landmark study highlights how short bursts of heavy rainfall triggered devastating flooding in the north Cornwall town of Boscastle in 2004. 
	Around 100 people were airlifted to safety, 58 properties were flooded and four businesses were demolished. 
	In the aftermath the Environment Agency created an £800,000 flood defence scheme and North Cornwall District Council gave the go-ahead for a £4.5m flood defence project for the village. 
	Researchers say the report is significant because previous climate models have not been able to work out the effect on extreme hourly rainfall in the warmer months. 
	To improve the resolution of their model, researchers in this latest experiment used smaller grid spacings than normal, providing it with more detailed research. 
	The report adds that previous interpretations of future regional climate change scenarios should be revisited, as changes in these types of rain events could have been underestimated."
2014-06-02,Inquiry Into Qatar 2022 Set To Wrap Up In Week,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140602135027/http://news.sky.com/story/1273765/qatar-fifa-investigator-to-meet-organisers,"Fifa's investigation into the successful bid by Qatar to host the 2022 World Cup will be completed by next Monday amid fresh corruption claims against the Gulf state. 
	The internal inquiry by world football's governing body, which is also looking at Russia's winning bid for 2018, will report its findings six weeks later - which would be after the World Cup in Brazil. 
	Organisers of Qatar 2022 were set to meet Fifa's chief ethics investigator Michael Garcia amid calls for the nation to be stripped of the tournament if corruption allegations are proven. 
	The expected talks in Oman come after the Sunday Times published fresh claims about payments being made to African federations to win support for the successful 2022 campaign. 
	The newspaper says it has seen millions of documents which show Qatar's victory was helped by a covert campaign by Mohamed Bin Hammam, a former Qatari vice-president of Fifa. 
	It alleged Mr Bin Hammam used secret funds to make ""dozens"" of payments totalling more than $5m (£2.98m) to win support for Qatar's bid. 
	It was also claimed he paid $1.6m (£950,000) into bank accounts controlled by Jack Warner, the former vice-president of Fifa. 
	Qatar's bid committee has denied any wrongdoing and said it would ""take any steps necessary"" to defend the process. 
	Fifa's vice president and African football head Issa Hayatou has denied allegations he received free private medical treatment and other favours for backing Qatar's bid. 
	Prime Minister David Cameron says Mr Garcia's inquiry should be allowed to run its course. 
	""There is an inquiry under way quite rightly into what happened in terms of the World Cup bid for 2022. I think we should let (it)  take place rather than prejudge it,"" he said. 
	In a statement the Qatar 2022 bid committee insisted Mr Bin Hammam had played no role in its bid and that it was ""co-operating fully with Mr Garcia's ongoing investigation"". 
	Meanwhile, the Football Federation Australia (FFA) has revealed it has also been investigating claims of corruption in the Qatari bid. 
	FFA chief executive David Gallop told SEN radio in Melbourne the association has been ""heavily involved"" in interviews and the production of documents. 
	Australia was one of five countries that competed to host the 2022 World Cup along with Qatar, South Korea, the United States and Japan. 
	Football Association chairman Greg Dyke is among those who have called for the bidding process to be re-run if the bribery claims are shown to be true."
2014-06-02,Missing Brit's Mum Jets To Jungle Island,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140602135027/http://news.sky.com/story/1273514/missing-brits-mum-jets-to-jungle-island,"The mum of a Brit missing in the Malaysian jungle is set to arrive on the island where he was last seen a week ago. 
	Paramilitary commandos and sniffer dogs have joined the hunt for Gareth Huntley, who is on a sabbatical from his job in the City. 
	The Foreign Office have confirmed five helicopters will now be deployed as the search intensifies. 
	The 34-year-old, who lives in Hackney, disappeared while trekking to visit a waterfall in Tioman Island, off the south eastern coast of the country's mainland. 
	Mr Huntley's girlfriend, Kit Natariga, arrived on the island on Sunday and will now be joined by his mother, Janet Southwell. 
	""It's really tough, especially coming onto the island,"" Ms Natariga told Sky News. 
	""It's beautiful, a paradise place, and I know Gareth's out there in the jungle somewhere. Every time I look out of the window, I hope I'll see him. 
	""It's very difficult ... he's in danger and time is running out."" 
	Defence Secretary Philip Hammond has been assured by the Malaysians that ""all available search assets"" are being used to find Mr Huntley. 
	Patrol boats are being used to help trace the accountant, and there is speculation that specialist military personnel from Britain, based in nearby Brunei, could join the search. 
	Mr Huntley's younger brother Mark said the family were staying positive. 
	""We want to personally thank David Cameron and Philip Hammond for their reassurances,"" he said. ""It is a very big positive for us. 
	""We are, of course, very grateful to the Malaysian people and the authorities for their work too. Everyone has been fantastic. 
	""We are told that local people went out to look for Gareth as soon as he was first described as missing - so without them there would not be a search mission. 
	""What we need now is for that work to continue and to find my brother."" 
	Mr Huntley, originally from West Yorkshire, set off on Tuesday telling friends at the Juara Turtle Project where he was volunteering that he would return by 2pm."

2014-06-02,Look To The Past For Help To Buy's Future,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140602135027/http://news.sky.com/story/1271441/look-to-the-past-for-help-to-buys-future,"It's not often the Government goes out of its way to tell people one of its policies hasn't been a runaway success, but that's precisely what seems to be happening today with Help to Buy. 
	The Treasury has published the first figures on the take-up of the controversial mortgage guarantee bit of the Help to Buy scheme and is at pains to point out how small those numbers are. 
	A ""mere"" 7,313 properties have been bought using the mortgage guarantee scheme since it started up in October, only 1.2% of total transactions. 
	The average property bought under the scheme was worth only £151, 597. And the vast majority of these purchases have been outside London and the South East. 
	To put this in perspective, more guarantees were issued in Orkney than in Camden and Westminster put together, while the biggest ""hotspot"" for the scheme was Leeds, where it was used 116 times in its first six months. 
	When the Treasury unveiled the Help to Buy scheme last spring, the Chancellor was adamant that, unlike previous attempts to kickstart housing activity, this one would have far better take-up - hence the high £600,000 threshold for eligible properties. 
	So why the reticence about its use now? 
	In large part it comes down to public opinion about the housing market. There are widespread concerns about the existence of a bubble in British property - most specifically in London. 
	Whereas this time last year the Chancellor's main concern was the threat of a triple-dip recession, today he is more worried about being seen as responsible for another property crash. 
	Which is why the Treasury is at pains to point out the scheme is hardly being used at all in London and that only a fraction of the total - 31 of 7,313 - applications were for properties worth between £500,000 and £600,000. 
	But, to get back to the original point, is the impact of the scheme as small as comes across from the Treasury's press release? Not necessarily. 
	For one thing, if you look at the numbers on a six-monthly basis, as the Treasury does, this underplays the acceleration in recent months. 
	In its first quarter, the mortgage guarantee scheme accounted for a mere 0.3% of property transactions, but in its second quarter, from January to March this year, it accounted for 2%. And the usage is rising quite quickly. 
	As it happens, it's already far more popular than the Thatcher government's famous Right to Buy scheme, which enabled council tenants to purchase their homes, was in its first six months. 
	There were 2,328 homes sold in England under Right to Buy in the scheme's first six months, from October 1980 to the spring of 1981. 
	The Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme, by contrast, has been responsible for 5,890 sales in England in its first six months. 
	Add on the new-build element of the scheme and the total comes to around 20,000 (or 16,000 if you just take the first six months of that new-build scheme, which began earlier than the mortgage guarantee element). 
	Now, that 20,000 rate is considerably lower than the 52,000 properties per six months rate the Right to Buy scheme achieved in its second year of operation. 
	And it should be noted that while the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme's numbers are still rising, the new-build scheme's popularity seems to have plateaued in recent months. 
	All the same, the point remains that Help to Buy is already proving itself to be an extraordinarily powerful, popular, widespread policy, whatever the Government would have you believe."
2014-06-02,Chilcot Report Edges Closer Amid Icy Exchanges,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140602135027/http://news.sky.com/story/1271525/chilcot-report-edges-closer-amid-icy-exchanges,"At last, 11 years after British and American forces invaded Iraq and five years after Sir John Chilcot began his official inquiry into Britain’s role in the war, it seems that the report could soon be published – perhaps even before the 2015 General Election, as David Cameron has demanded. 
	The report has been delayed by a stand-off between the inquiry team and two successive Cabinet Secretaries, Sir Gus (now Lord) O’Donnell and Sir Jeremy Heywood, who blocked publication of conversations and private notes between Tony Blair and then US President George W Bush on confidentiality grounds. 
	They also opposed publication of Cabinet minutes and other official records. 
	Tony Blair has repeatedly denied that he was the cause of the hold-up. Both O’Donnell and Heywood worked closely with his government. 
	Now an icily choreographed public exchange between Chilcot and the Cabinet Office confirms that the logjam has been broken. 
	Chilcot had been embarrassing the government deliberately by refusing to go ahead with one of the final legal steps required before publication of an official report - so-called ""Maxwellisation"". 
	Named after a 1969 court victory by the late disgraced business tycoon Robert Maxwell, this process requires that those criticised in the report are sent drafts of the relevant sections for comment prior to publication. 
	The inquiry is not required to take on board what they say. 
	The inquiry argued that their report would be incomplete unless they could refer to cabinet minutes and details of the Blair Bush relationship. 
	They argued that Blair and other members of his team had already negated the high expectation of confidentiality traditionally granted to a Prime Minister in their own published memoirs. 
	In essence, publication of the details of these exchanges should allow the public to decide whether Tony Blair committed Britain to war at an early stage come what may. 
	Documents will still not be published in full. But the Cabinet Secretary agreed earlier this year that the inquiry can give details from over 200 Cabinet level meetings, including quoting extracts of the minutes. 
	Yesterday the two sides also agreed that they will now negotiate on what ""gists and quotes"" they can include from 25 notes from Blair to Bush and more than 130 records of conversations between the two leaders. 
	Direct quotation will be ""the minimum necessary"" but the public announcement of a deal suggests that the government side has given ground decisively. 
	Unless there is exceptional foot dragging during the negotiations, they should be concluded in a matter of weeks. The inquiry team has already completed its draft and specified what it would like to quote. 
	Maxwellisation is a private matter between the inquiry and its subjects but on past form it should take no longer than three months. 
	After that Sir John says he will submit the finished report to the Prime Minister, ""as soon as possible"". 
	It will then be up to David Cameron to decide when we get to see the Iraq Inquiry report."
2014-06-02,Blair: 'Dangerous To Ignore' EU Election Results,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140602135027/http://news.sky.com/story/1273654/blair-dangerous-to-ignore-eu-election-results,"Tony Blair has warned Europe it would be ""complacent and dangerous"" if it fails to reform itself following a surge by anti-immigration and eurosceptic parties. 
	He warned UKIP's victory in the UK and that of Marine Le Pen's far-right National Front in France was a ""wake-up call"" on the need for change and ""cannot be ignored"". 
	Voters last month dramatically altered the make-up of the European Parliament by increasing the number of MEPs from the populist, eurosceptic Right. 
	In a speech to the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) in London, the former British prime minister said: ""The victories of UKIP in the UK and the National Front in France and the election of parties across the continent on explicitly 'anti-the-status-quo in Europe' platforms signify something. They cannot be ignored. 
	""The election results matter. They are a wake-up call to Europe and to Britain. Our response in Europe, as in Britain, should be to lead, not follow."" 
	He went on: ""So when some European politicians say that despite the showing of the far-right nonetheless there is still a majority for a pro-Europe position, that is true, but it is also complacent and dangerous."" 
	Prime Minister David Cameron has promised to overhaul Britain's relationship with Europe. 
	Mr Blair also appeared to criticise Mr Cameron's plans for a renegotiation and in-out referendum on Europe by 2017 and said ""a new approach"" should involve ""minimum treaty change"". 
	He called on pro-Europeans to ""make the debate more than about the repatriation of certain competencies and rules"". 
	Mr Blair said: ""The moment is right for Europe to think carefully about where it goes from here, and how it reconnects with the concerns of its citizens and how it changes in order better to realise its ideals in a changing world. 
	""It has to be a debate elevated to a Europe-wide level, with Britain playing a leading role, not just a negotiation of Britain's terms of membership. 
	""It has to be about what is good for Europe as well as what is good for Britain."" 
	The intervention came with Mr Cameron embroiled in a row over who should take over as the next president of the European Commission. 
	He has reportedly said Britain could quit the EU if Jean-Claude Juncker - the former leader of Luxembourg who the Prime Minister sees as a symbol of Europe's past - is elected. 
	According to German publication Der Spiegel, he is reported to have said: ""A figure from the 1980s cannot resolve the problems of the next five years."""

	The Archbishops' Council, led by the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Archbishop of York, says changes must be made to give greater protection to remains which have to be exhumed along the proposed route. 
	In a ""humble petition"" to the House of Commons, the Council says that works authorised by the Bill to bring in the project will involve the destruction of three burial grounds. 
	The petition says the Bill should not be allowed to pass unless the removal of remains are ""treated in a decent and reverent manner"" or are subsequently reinterred in consecrated land. 
	It adds there are inadequate provisions to ensure that any monuments that are removed ""are disposed of in a suitable manner"". 
	The petition says: ""This is inconsistent with the approach taken in other legislation which provides for the compulsory acquisition of land and its use for statutory purposes."" 
	It concludes: ""Your petitioners therefore humbly pray your Honourable House that the Bill may not be allowed to pass into law as it now stands."" 
	Other high-profile petitioners have also lobbied Parliament to stop the controversial scheme in its current form. 
	They include Earl Spencer, brother of the late Diana, Princess of Wales, and Lord Rothschild, who both own land along the route. 
	Other objectors include Nicholas and Alice van Cutsem, close friends of the Duke of Cambridge, and Lord Richard Wellesley, a descendant of the Duke of Wellington. 
	They have complained that the rail link will cut through their estates, cause noise and damage areas of outstanding natural beauty. 
	In April, 33 Conservative MPs rebelled against the blueprint for the high-speed line but the Government enjoyed a comfortable victory as the bill for the £50bn scheme passed with a 411 majority. 
	A wrecking amendment to the legislation for the project put forward by former Cabinet minister and rebel ringleader Cheryl Gillan was defeated by 451 votes to 50, with a total of 32 Tory MPs backing the amendment."
2014-06-02,'Savile's 500 Victims Were As Young As Two',https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140602135027/http://news.sky.com/story/1273479/saviles-500-victims-were-as-young-as-two,"Jimmy Savile abused at least 500 people as young at two years old, according to an NSPCC study. 
	The figures emerged as a lawyer for many of his victims told Sky News a similar scandal could occur today unless a law of mandatory reporting is introduced compelling those who know about abuse to tell the authorities. 
	The NSPCC study, commissioned for BBC Panorama, exposes confidential documents that show the extent of Savile's offending at hospitals. 
	Liz Dux, who represents 170 of the victims, told Sky News: ""This report looks at those in authority who knew, who were effectively complicit in what Savile was up to, who knew and allowed him to continue for the sake of their organisation because he was raising money or giving their organisation kudos or because of his celebrity status. 
	""If he had been stopped earlier so many ruined lives could have been saved. 
	""What is so disgraceful is that these people who knew and allowed him to continue can't be brought to task. 
	""At the moment we don't have any kind of law of mandatory reporting and that's what we want to change … so that never again can people put their own organisation before the safety and welfare of children. 
	""Until we have a change in the law I'm afraid this kind of dreadful scandal could happen again. 
	""It is dangerous to say this is something that happened in the 1970s and couldn't happen now. 
	""I'm still seeing examples of abuse in schools where head teachers have been told of abuse and have failed to take action because they're worried about the reputation of their establishment."" 
	The NSPCC uncovered Savile's unprecedented access to Broadmoor hospital, where some of his abuse took place. 
	The most common age group for Savile's victims was 13 to 15 - but the youngest alleged victim was just two years old. 
	Peter Watt, the NSPCC's director of child protection, said: ""There's no doubt that Savile is one of the most, if not the most, prolific sex offender that we at the NSPCC have ever come across."" 
	One of Savile's victims, Sylvia Edwards, told Sky News those who knew about his behaviour should face justice. 
	""He's destroyed a lot of lives and in a way we've all allowed it because we've let it go on for so long without saying anything,"" she said. 
	""The people who allowed it should all be held accountable."" 
	Reviews into how Savile was allowed to abuse so many people at the BBC and in 33 hospitals will be published this year."
2014-06-02,Rally Crash: Car 'Like 100mph Bowling Ball',https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140602135027/http://news.sky.com/story/1272952/rally-crash-car-like-100mph-bowling-ball,"Questions are being asked about the safety of a car rally in Scotland after two cars came off the road, killing three people and injuring six others. 
	Jim Clark Rally organisers only abandoned the event following the second crash, which took place at Little Swinton, near Coldstream, around 4pm on Saturday. 
	John Provan, 64, Elizabeth Allan, 63, and 71-year-old John Leonard Stern - all from the Greater Glasgow area - died when the car left the road. 
	The three were pronounced dead at the scene, and their bodies were expected to be removed from the site later today. 
	Another man was in a critical condition in hospital after the accident. 
	Meanwhile, Colin Gracey, who said he saw the fatal crash, said he had safety concerns about the event. 
	The 46-year-old teacher has watched the race for the last 17 years at the same spot - on a hill above where the accident took place. 
	He told Sky News that in previous years, the tape was 30m from the road to keep spectators away from the speeding cars - but this time the tape was close to the road. 
	He also said there had previously been a steward's car at the end of the road, and whistles would go off if spectators encroached on to the road. But he claimed there was such car there and no whistles this time. 
	He described the accident as ""horrendous"", ""dreadful"" and ""awful"" and equated the rally car to a bowling ball at 100mph. 
	Mr Gracey said the rally car ""came through at great speed and lost it on the bridge and veered right into the gap, into the field, hitting quite a few people, who stood where they shouldn't really have stood unfortunately"". 
	""In previous rallies, the area beyond the bridge is very well marked off, taped off at least 30 metres into the field. For some reason this time the tape was just on the other side of the hedge, which made us have concerns."" 
	The rally car was going over a hump at speed before it lost control, Sky sources understand. 
	The crash came two hours after another car left the road near Crosshall Farm, striking five people. 
	Three men were initially taken to Borders General Hospital, however one was later transferred to an intensive care unit in Edinburgh. 
	The remaining two spectators were treated for minor injuries. 
	Police say the two drivers involved in the crashes were unhurt. 
	Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond expressed his condolences following the two accidents, calling them ""desperately sad"". 
	The Jim Clark Rally takes place over three days on closed roads in the Duns and Kelso areas. 
	The rally course is described on the event's website as having ""a reputation for being fast with big jumps, ditches and hedges"". 
	The event is named after Scottish Formula One driver Jim Clark, who was raised in the area. Clark died in a motor racing accident in Hockenheim, Germany, in 1968. 
	The organisers of the race expressed their ""heartfelt condolences and sympathy"" to the families and their friends affected by the tragic events."
2014-06-02,Bill Promises Protection For Do-Gooders,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140602135027/http://news.sky.com/story/1273770/bill-promises-protection-for-do-gooders,"New laws are to be introduced in England and Wales to protect people who carry out good deeds from prosecution and negligence claims. 
	It would mean a judge would have to consider three mitigating factors before deciding whether an individual should be liable for an accident when they were doing something for ""the benefit of society"", acting in a ""generally responsible way"", or whether they stepped in to ""help in an emergency"". 
	The proposed changes to the law are being brought in by Justice Secretary Chris Grayling under a new Heroism Bill, which is expected to be unveiled in the Queen's speech on Wednesday. 
	Mr Grayling told Sky News: ""We want to send a big message from Parliament to the courts to say that we want common sense to be applied if people are doing the right thing. 
	""If they get involved to try and help somebody who is in trouble, if they are a responsible employer but something unexpected goes wrong or somebody acts irresponsibly, or if they are trying to do the right thing for society - we want the law to be on their side. 
	""But we also don't want people to be sued in the first place, so what I hope this is also, is a message to the jobsworth culture that you often find in our society to say actually, the law is more clearly on the side of people who do the right thing."" 
	However, solicitor Simon Joyston Bechal said the proposed legislation was not needed because judges take such factors into account already. 
	He told Sky News: ""They want the judges to look at three specific extra factors ... but it seems to me that a judge looking at a negligence case will already be taking these factors into account."" 
	Sky News' Deputy Political Editor Joey Jones said: ""Members of the public are fearful that if they get involved in trying to do something that they might feel is a good deed, it might end up rebounding on them with the possibility of legal action. 
	""Chris Grayling feels there is a real issue here and that's why he is trying to make it obvious not just to the individuals involved, but to the judges, to make sure there is no confusion in the future."""
2014-06-02,Scots Independence: BAE Systems Chief's Fears,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140602135027/http://news.sky.com/story/1273599/scots-independence-bae-systems-chiefs-fears,"The boss of Britain's biggest defence company has become the latest business leader to warn against Scottish independence. 
	BAE Systems chief executive Ian King said that a ""yes"" vote would damage the ""certainty and stability"" necessary for investment. 
	Mr King's comments were made on a company blog, as the official campaign over independence was launched. 
	The defence giant currently employs 3,600 people in Scotland. 
	He said the company was pinning its hopes on an official decision for naval procurement, as it overhauls shipbuilding operations in Glasgow. 
	Mr King said the company was ""investing in facilities for the future"" in Scotland ""based on an expectation that the Government will make their major production decision for the next generation Type 26 frigate by the end of this year"". 
	He said: ""If Scotland became independent, we would no longer have that certainty and stability. 
	""We would then have to talk to our major UK customer, the Ministry of Defence, and jointly work out a plan for the future."" 
	Supporters of the ""yes"" vote in the forthcoming referendum insist Scotland will be better off as an independent state within the EU. 
	First Minister Alex Salmond said independence will make Scottish homes £2,000 richer, while the Treasury says Scots will be £1,400 richer if they stay in the union. 
	But Mr King also voiced concerns about staff pensions post-independence. 
	He said: ""If Scotland became independent and subsequently joined the European Union, our pension schemes, along with many other UK company schemes, may be caught up in EU regulations relating to cross-border pensions. 
	""The reality today is we can't say how our pension schemes would be affected. 
	""There would be a number of possible outcomes and we would use our consultation processes to discuss the options."" 
	His comments come amid a growing business chorus questioning Scottish independence. 
	On Friday Kingfisher chief executive Sir Ian Cheshire, the boss of B&Q's parent firm, said there were too many uncertainties around tax, currency and Scottish EU membership. 
	Last month, the British Chambers of Commerce, which itself remains impartial in the debate, surveyed close to 2,500 of its members, and whilst 11% said Scotland should vote yes, some 85% preferred the union to remain."

	The Prime Minister has previously said he sees the former Luxembourg leader as a symbol of Europe's past and argued other leaders are more capable of delivering change. 
	He is now so worried Mr Juncker's appointment would destabilise the UK Government he would bring forward an in-out referendum, according to German publication Der Spiegel. 
	""A figure from the 1980s cannot resolve the problems of the next five years,"" he is reported to have said. 
	The magazine claimed Mr Cameron made the threat during a meeting with the German Chancellor at a summit of EU leaders in Brussels. 
	Angela Merkel has given her backing to Mr Juncker, who told Germany's Bild am Sonntag newspaper he has support from ""a broad majority"" of conservative and centre-left leaders and is confident of being elected. 
	Ms Merkel and Mr Juncker's parties both belong to the European People's Party bloc, which dominates the European Parliament and has chosen him as its preferred candidate for the presidential post. 
	A Downing Street spokesman refused to comment on what Mr Cameron may have said in what it called ""a private conversation"". 
	The Prime Minister's alleged warning came as Iain Duncan Smith said Mr Cameron must deliver ""substantial and significant return of powers"" from the EU to win the backing of Tories. 
	The Work and Pensions Secretary told The Sunday Telegraph: ""He knows very well he can't come back with nothing."" 
	Asked whether Mr Cameron would follow through with his pledge to deliver a referendum if the Tories are re-elected at the next election, Mr Duncan Smith replied: ""I've looked him in the eye and I've asked him (that) simple question. 
	""He said, 'Yeah, I won't be in a Government if they won't have a referendum.'"""

	Two people died at the scene and five casualties were taken to hospital by ambulance and air ambulance after the collision which involved six motorbikes. 
	The condition of the injured is not known. 
	Specialist officers examined the scene as the road was closed with diversions put in place. 
	None of those involved in the crash have been identified. 
	Inspector Gareth Jones, of North Wales Police, said: ""The incident involved a car and six motorcycles - two riders of which sadly passed away at the scene. 
	""Five further casualties were conveyed to hospital by the Helimed and ambulance. An update is awaited on their condition.

	The star tweeted an apology to fans on Saturday and admitted that ""things have gone a little sideways"". 
	The video, obtained by MailOnline, appears to show band members Zayn Malik, 21, and Louis Tomlinson, 22, sharing a rolled up cigarette in the back of a car as they are driven through Peru. 
	The band's spokesman told Sky News the matter was being handled by their lawyers. 
	One Direction are currently on their Where We Are tour in the UK and are due to play at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester on Sunday night. 
	""I love my boys and maybe things have gone a little sideways I apologise for that. We are only in our 20s we all do stupid things at this age,"" Payne wrote. 
	""We all have a lot of growing up to do in an extreme circumstance I'm not making excuse but it's fact we are gunna fall short somewhere,"" he added. 
	Since their debut on ITV's X Factor talent show One Direction, which also includes members Harry Styles and Niall Horan, has become one of the biggest boy bands on the planet. 
	Earlier this month they were named the fourth wealthiest musicians in the Sunday Times Rich List with an estimated fortune of £14m each and a combined wealth of £70m. 
	Payne has often tweeted about the pressures of fame and being scrutinised by the media. 
	Earlier this year he was forced to apologise after posting a photograph on Twitter showing him standing on a ledge of a skyscraper 34 floors above the ground. 
	He wrote on Saturday: ""Hopefully we stand the test of time an get it right in the end I don't take this for granted and I'm extremely grateful to be here doing this."""
2014-06-02,Workplace Pensions Shake-Up 'Could Boost Funds',https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140602135027/http://news.sky.com/story/1273108/workplace-pensions-shake-up-could-boost-funds,"Radical changes to workplace pensions are set to be unveiled in the Queen's Speech this week, with supporters claiming the shake-up could boost retirement incomes by thousands of pounds. 
	Staff will be able to put their money into Dutch-style ""collective pensions"", which are shared with thousands of other members. 
	They are regarded by many as a better investment because they are less vulnerable to stock market variations. 
	The changes, which could be in place as early as 2016, are designed to give better value for pensioners. 
	Pensions Minister Steve Webb has described the collective schemes, also known as ""mega funds"", as ""some of the best in the world"". 
	Mr Webb told The Sunday Telegraph the key advantage was ""pooling risk"" of investments performing worse than expected across large numbers of people of different ages, ""just like car insurance or the NHS"". 
	""It gives people greater certainty and probably better value,"" he said. 
	However, critics of the model have warned that pensioners only have a ""target"" for what they will get in retirement, rather than a guarantee as is the case with a fixed annuity. 
	Pensioners could in some cases see their incomes fall if the collective fund's investments do not generate the expected profits. 
	The plan is based on schemes in the Netherlands and Scandanavia. 
	But some Dutch politicians have recently called for the pensions to be scrapped in favour of British-style individual pensions. 
	A new bill scrapping tax rules that have stopped pensioners taking more than a quarter of their savings in a cash lump sum will also be included in the Queen's Speech. 
	Other legislation expected includes: 
:: A crackdown on highly paid civil servants and NHS executives getting large redundancy pay-offs before taking similar jobs within a year of leaving their posts. 
:: Tax free childcare worth up to £2,000 per child for families where both parents have jobs. 
:: A bill to change trespass laws to allow shale gas exploration firms to drill beneath private property without requiring permission from the owner. 
:: The Queen's Speech is also expected to contain measures to support further oil and gas developments in the North Sea, and for more major roads to be built. 
:: A ""Recall Bill"" allowing voters to sack their elected MPs, although this has been subject to disagreements inside the coalition. 
	Legislation for a referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union will not be included, amid opposition from the Liberal Democrats. 
	David Cameron is instead expected to promise he will use the Parliament Act to overrule the House of Lords and force a bill from a backbench Tory MP into law. 
	On the eve of setting out its legislative agenda, the coalition has been accused of running out of steam less than a year before the general election. 
	Labour has released figures claiming the coalition has become a ""zombie government"", with MPs debating fewer bills last year than at any time since 1950. 
	Treasury Minister Nicky Morgan rejected this, telling the Murnaghan programme the Queen's Speech will prove the government is ""full of ideas""."
2014-06-20,Benefit Claims 'Fiasco' For Sick And Disabled,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140620034445/http://news.sky.com/story/1285819/fiasco-over-benefits-for-sick-and-disabled,"By Becky Johnson, Sky News Reporter A Government welfare scheme has been branded a ""fiasco"" for leaving thousands of disabled people waiting months for payments. 
	An influential group of MPs said the new Personal Independence Payment (PIP) had left vulnerable people unnecessarily distressed. 
	They said the scheme, which replaced Disability Living Allowance (DLA) for working age people last year, had been rushed through, with a ""shocking"" impact on the lives of claimants. 
	PIP was introduced by the Government to help simplify the welfare system. 
	Claimants can receive between £21 and £138 a week but must attend an assessment to calculate the level of support they are entitled to. 
	However, Margaret Hodge, who chairs the cross-party Public Accounts Committee, said: ""The implementation of PIP has been nothing short of a fiasco. 
	""The Department for Work and Pensions has let down some of the most vulnerable people in our society, many of whom have had to wait more than six months for their claims to be decided. 
	""The personal stories we heard were shocking. We heard evidence of a claimant requiring hospital intervention as a result of the stress caused by the delays suffered."" 
	Stephanie Kendrick, 43, from Buckley, Flintshire, developed a condition last year that makes it difficult for her to walk. 
	She had to give up work and applied for PIP in August last year. 
	She was told it would take between eight and 10 weeks but a series of delays meant it took eight months for the payments to be agreed. 
	She told Sky News it put such a strain on her finances she and her husband had to put their house up for sale. 
	""I've had to live off food parcels from my family ... we've relied on relatives and friends who have bought milk and bread, just ... to make sure we can pay the gas and the electric,"" she said. 
	The Government denied it had let vulnerable people down. 
	Mike Penning, the minister for disabled people, said: ""New PIP includes a face-to-face assessment and regular reviews to ensure support goes to those who need it most. 
	""The PAC report is based on old statistics. I've introduced a faster process for people with terminal illnesses, with clearance times reducing to our target of 10 days. 
	""A higher proportion of people are getting the highest rate of financial support for daily living under PIP than DLA."""
2014-06-20,Lack Of Competitive Sport 'Harming' Pupils,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140620034445/http://news.sky.com/story/1285865/lack-of-competitive-sport-harming-pupils,"By Emma Birchley, Sky News Correspondent Failure to give pupils the chance to play competitive sports has an impact on their education, the schools watchdog Ofsted has warned. 
	The chief inspector of schools, Sir Michael Wilshaw, believes too many schools are treating the chance to compete as ""an optional extra"" when it should be a priority. 
	The research was carried out after it emerged that more than 40% of the country's Olympic medals were won by former independent school pupils at London 2012, despite only 7% of all children attending fee-paying schools. 
	Sir Michael said: ""What this report clearly shows is that where there is a clear determination for schools to be the best, even though their facilities may not be great, they find a way - whether it's finding a nearby sports field to use or swimming pool - so where there is a real commitment it works, and where there isn't a commitment, it doesn't."" 
	Double Olympic gold medallist Rebecca Adlington, who went to a state school, believes her competitive streak helped her way from the pool. 
	""I started swimming competitively when I was 11 and yet my education was very important to me and it made me focus more in class,"" she told Sky News. 
	""I had more energy, I was able to focus and learnt time management from an early age and for me sport had given me much more than those Olympic medals."" 
	At Fearnhill School in Letchworth, Hertfordshire, the importance of competition is also understood. 
	Gold medal winning Olympic cyclist Victoria Pendleton was a former student. 
	Head of PE Simon Lawrence said: ""Participation is important but I think that that drive to win is crucial and it's transferable into other areas of life ... job interviews, exam results."" 
	But he said it was impossible to compare the facilities available at independent schools with what his pupils have available. 
	""A lot of private schools have outstanding facilities and extra coaches that help them,"" he said. 
	""I think the opportunities that pupils get at private schools are far greater to try some of these sports. A lot of pupils at this school never have the chance to try rowing for example."" 
	And at his school, sport teachers already spend about two nights a week working late to hold clubs and attend fixtures, as well as having sessions in lunch breaks."

	Ms Grant - who has been in Brazil for the World Cup - said she was ""confident"" that delays with up to 30,000 applications would be sorted out in time for families to get away. 
	Home Secretary Theresa May this week apologised to people who have had their travel plans disrupted by the delays - after pictures emerged of applications piling up in a passport office in Liverpool. 
	HM Passport Office says it has been dealing with the highest demand seen for 12 years after an earlier than usual start to the summer surge in applications. 
	Ms Grant told House magazine she was ""in no doubt"" that passports would be issued in time. 
	She said: ""But if you don't want to go away, we have some fantastic holidays here. 
	""I think there's a lot to be said for the 'staycation'. People need to do what they like."" 
	Ms Grant, who is also sports minister, added: ""I think we are going to have a great summer, we are certainly going to have a great summer of sport too, there's lots of opportunities to build your holiday around a spoilt-for-choice list of events, the Tour de France Grand Depart, we've got the golf, we've got the Commonwealth Games, we've got football that we can watch on the TV. 
	""It's a wonderful place to have your holiday."" 
	Ms Grant tweeted photos of herself in Brazil - including with FA chief Greg Dyke - where she was in the stands for England's 2-1 defeat to Uruguay in Sao Paulo on Thursday night. 
	On the morning of the match she tweeted: ""Damp with a slight chill in the air in São Paulo this morning. Dare I say good conditions for @england ? #WorldCup #ComeOnEngland"" 
	Holidaymakers who have faced an anxious wait for new passports because of the backlog accused the minister of ""not living in the real world"". 
	Retired nurse Eileen Shepherd, 68, had to miss out on a £1,750 cruise around the British Isles after she was told the day before she was due to set sail that her passport was not ready. 
	The pensioner, from Darlington, County Durham, said: ""How dare she tell us where to go on holiday? Cheeky sod. I think people will be gunning for her. 
	""That comment is not helpful and not what we expect from elected personnel. 
	""She is not living in the real world with people like us. 
	""It is appalling. I've worked all my life and saved all my life to be able to go on one big holiday a year and I was robbed of that chance."" 
	Martin Cook, 43, from Ipswich, endured delays getting his passport and only got it the day before he flew out to Prague for a weekend away with his wife Annabel last month, despite submitting his application four weeks earlier. 
	He said: ""Her comments are laughable. It is ludicrous. 
	""It is not her place to tell people where to holiday. If somebody has made their plans and put their passport application in in good time they should be able to travel where they like. It is a basic liberty."" 
	A Department for Culture, Media and Sport spokesman said: ""Helen Grant was crystal clear that she was confident that people would get their passports to be able to travel overseas. 
	""As tourism minister it is completely right that she champions the domestic tourism market, but she was in no way linking the two issues."" 
	Prime Minister David Cameron's official spokesman said: ""It is always a matter for individuals and individual families where they may choose to take a holiday. 
	""The Prime Minister himself and his family, of course, have often holidayed in the UK. But the decisions individual families take are up to them."""

	Saudi Arabian student Nahid Almanea, 31, was attacked as she walked along a footpath in Colchester, Essex on Tuesday morning. 
	Officers told a news conference they were investigating whether her clothing - an abaya robe and a hijab headscarf - may have been a factor in the stabbing, but that they do not yet know for sure. 
	Police have released CCTV footage of a woman they believe was Ms Almanea walking past shops in Hunwicke Road at around 10.20am on Tuesday. 
	And they have also shown on a map the route she was most likely to have taken as she made her way from home in Woodrow Way before the knife attack at the Salary Brook Trail. 
	Officers said Ms Almanea lived with her brother and would normally walk to the University of Essex with him. Because he had earlier lectures that day, she was walking alone. 
	They said two of the wounds she received would have been fatal on their own and they were also looking into whether the killing was linked to another fatal stabbing in March. 
	Chief Insp Richard Phillibrown said: ""It's true that we've two knife murders in Colchester in less than three months, where the motive remains unknown. 
	""I urge everyone in Colchester to be vigilant. The similarities between those two offences will be drawn. 
	""It's important that people are aware of their own surroundings, that they don't go out alone in isolated places, that they take sensible precautions."" 
	A 52-year-old man arrested in connection with the incident has been released after police said he had been positively eliminated from their enquiries. 
	Detective Chief Superintendent Steve Worron said Ms Almanea ""suffered at least two knife wounds which would have proved fatal on their own, but in total she was stabbed 16 times to her body, neck, head and arms"". 
	It comes after the murder of a vulnerable man, who had a brain injury after being hit by a car four years ago, near Castle Park in Colchester in the early hours of the morning on March 29. 
A post-mortem examination found 33-year-old James Attfield had been stabbed more than 100 times. 
	Essex Police also issued an image of the bag Ms Almanea was using at the time she was killed. 
	They said it was a black and orange shoulder bag with the logo Activ on it. 
	Anyone who saw a woman walking though the Greenstead estate on Tuesday morning carrying this bag is asked to contact officers on 101."
2014-06-20,One Direction's Louis To Raise £2m For Doncaster,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140620034445/http://news.sky.com/story/1285324/one-directions-louis-to-raise-2m-for-doncaster,"One Direction's Louis Tomlinson is using crowdfunding in an attempt to raise £2m for his new football club, Doncaster Rovers. 
	The singer has launched a campaign with former chairman John Ryan to secure the future of the League One team after their deal to take over the side was completed. 
	The pair have put a six-figure sum into the Tomlinson Ryan Trust and are asking football and One Direction fans to make their own donations in return for rewards. 
	It is thought to be one of the biggest crowdfunding initiatives launched in the UK. 
	Twenty-two-year-old Tomlinson is a global star as one member of One Direction and is a lifelong fan of his hometown club. 
	He played for their reserve side against Barnsley earlier this year and had been close to a takeover before, but a move was twice delayed because of negotiations over image rights. 
	Tomlinson and Ryan said they want to the trust to help ""support the club's ambitions on the football field, to develop its schools, youth and charity programmes and to grow the club as a brand, as well as its supporter base, both locally and internationally"". 
	""For me, this is all about the football, the community and restoring the excitement and desire to making Doncaster Rovers the most exciting club to play for in Yorkshire,"" said Tomlinson. 
	""I grew up in Doncaster and have felt the love for football run through the town, it's for that reason that I have a real personal passion to make Doncaster Rovers a success story. I want to see the Doncaster Rovers' supporters get the club the success it deserves."" 
	The project will only be funded if the target is reached by 2.46pm July 17. 
	Businessman Ryan, who ended his 15-year association with Rovers in November, has extensive football experience and oversaw Doncaster's rise from non-league to the Championship as well as their move from Belle Vue to the Keepmoat Stadium before stepping aside in November to allow Terry Bramall and Dick Watson to take over. 
	The initial delay to the takeover had related to Tomlinson's image rights, which are owned by his management team and would entitle them to a share of any money generated from the use of his image or name. 
	They believe that interest in the club will increase as a result of Tomlinson's ownership and it is understood they battled for a share of any extra revenue made through merchandise and extra ticket sales. 
	Tomlinson signed on as a player at the start of the season in a move to make money for the Bluebell Wood charity and turned out in front of nearly 10,000 fans for the reserve team in February. 
	One Direction, also made up of Harry Styles, Liam Payne, Niall Horan and Zayn Malik, are currently on the European leg of their tour. 
	Their next concert is in France on Friday."

	The charges follow an investigation by South Wales Police into claims of patients' notes being falsified. 
	They were brought under Section 44 of the Mental Capacity Act 2005.  
	The three accused work at the Princess of Wales Hospital and have been suspended since last year. 
	They have been named as Lauro Bertulano, 44, Clare Cahill, 41 and Rebecca Jones, 29 - all from the Bridgend area. 
	They are due to appear before Bridgend Magistrates Court on Monday, July 28.

2014-06-20,Pit Manager Cleared Over Wales Mine Deaths,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140620034445/http://news.sky.com/story/1285586/pit-manager-cleared-over-wales-mine-deaths,"A former pit manager has been cleared of manslaughter after four miners drowned at a colliery in South Wales. 
	Malcolm Fyfield had been in charge of the Gleision mine when around 650,000 gallons of water were unleashed after explosives were used. 
	Philip Hill, 44, Charles Breslin, 62, David Powell, 50, and 39-year-old Garry Jenkins were killed in the tragedy in September 2011. 
	MNS Mining, the owner of the colliery near Pontardawe, was also cleared of corporate manslaughter charges. 
	Mr Fyfield, 58, was negligent by allowing the men to dig towards an area where underground water was present, according to prosecutors. 
	But the father-of-two insisted he carried out safety inspections on the eve of the tragedy which showed no water was present. 
	He broke down in tears and hugged his wife Gillian after the verdicts were delivered at Swansea Crown Court. 
	The men had been working in a part of Gleision called H1 on September 15 when tragedy struck. 
	They were trying to break through an area called The Old Central Workings to improve ventilation. 
	Mr Fyfield, who was close to the blast site, managed to escape after crawling through dirt and sludge. 
	When he eventually reached the surface 20 minutes later, he told rescuers: ""There is no hope for the others."" 
	Two other men who also managed to get out alive - Nigel Evans and David ""Jake"" Wyatt - later described the sound of the rushing water as like a ""jet engine"" whoosh. 
	Two witnesses for the prosecution - outgoing mine manager Ray Thomas and Neath Port Talbot Council planning chief Alun Rees - both said they warned Mr Fyfield about underground water weeks before the massive flood. 
	But Mr Fyfield's QC Elwen Evans described the investigation into the tragedy as inadequate - saying many parts of the mine were not examined afterwards. 
	The defendant himself also said he had carried out three safety inspections the day before. He insisted he had examined both sides of the coalface and not found any water. 
	After the case, relatives of the victims issued a statement which was read by a police officer, saying they would never get over their loss."

	Ruby Wax, Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French were among mourners who attended the service at St George's Church in Dittisham, Devon. 
	Mayall - known for roles in TV hits such as Bottom, The New Statesman and The Young Ones - had a home in the county. 
	Prior to the service, Mayall's widow Barbara asked fans for their ""thoughts and prayers"" during the private ceremony. 
	Around 140 people packed the church to remember the star who died last week aged 56 at his home in Barnes, southwest London after going for a morning jog. 
	Mrs Mayall said he died of an ""acute cardiac event"". 
	Adrian Edmondson, with whom Mayall forged a friendship as a student in Manchester and who was his comedy partner for many of his most memorable series, was among the pall-bearers as the coffin was led from the church. 
	Others who filed into the church, accompanied by Procol Harum's A Whiter Shade Of Pale on organ, were Alan Rickman and actor and director Peter Richardson, a long-standing friend with whom Mayall had worked repeatedly. 
	Ben Elton, his old friend from university and one of his co-writers on The Young Ones, was also among the mourners who saw the wicker coffin - adorned with red flowers - carried into the church. 
	A memorial service for the star is expected to be held in September. 
	Mayall shot to national fame for his role as poetry-writing anarchist Rick in The Young Ones, going on to star as conniving Conservative MP Alan B'Stard in The New Statesman and Lord Flashheart in Blackadder."

	The 71-year-old Hollywood actor will begin rehabilitation soon, according to his publicist Ina Treciokas. 
	In a statement to Sky News, she said: ""Harrison Ford's left leg was broken in an accident. 
	""His surgery was successful and he will begin rehab shortly. He's doing well and looks forward to returning to work."" 
	Ford had to be airlifted to hospital in Oxford following the accident last Thursday. 
	He was originally thought to have damaged his ankle in the mishap at the Buckinghamshire studios. 
	Police said the actor had been injured by a ""garage door"" but there have been suggestions the door of the Star Wars spacecraft Millennium Falcon fell on him. 
	The American is reprising his role as Han Solo in the latest episode in the Star Wars franchise, Episode VII. 
	It is being directed by JJ Abrams and is scheduled for release in December 2015. 
	Disney spokesman Paul Roeder said filming would continue on schedule while Ford recovers. 
	The plot of Episode VII has been kept a secret but it takes place 30 years after the end of Return Of The Jedi. 
	Ford's co-stars in Episode VII include many of those who were in the original film - Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope - including Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill. 
	Among the new cast are 12 Years A Slave actress Lupita Nyong'o and Games Of Thrones star Gwendoline Christie."
2014-06-20,Why Li's Handshake With Queen Is Uncomfortable,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140620034445/http://news.sky.com/story/1284737/why-lis-handshake-with-queen-is-uncomfortable,"The desire for Britain and China to take their relationship in trade and investment to a new level is obvious. 
	Put simply, China has the cash and the spending power that could really help Britain. 
	Equally, the UK has experience and expertise which China could use in so many sectors from energy, design and innovation to finance, education and health. 
	That seems to explain why Britain has rolled out the red carpet in a big way for Premier Li on his three-day London trip. 
	There was an audience with the Queen - unusual given Mr Li is Prime Minister, not head of state. There was a guard of honour too. 
	But watching Mr Li shake hands with the Queen and then inspect the soldiers from the Coldstream Guards, formed up in his honour, makes some observers feel uncomfortable. 
	The reason? Two words: ""human rights"". It is a loaded phrase, I know. It means different things in different contexts and to different people. 
	In Britain there is sometimes frustration, even outrage, when convicted foreign criminals are allowed to remain in the UK because deportation infringes their ""human rights"". 
	But what about when the phrase is applied to China, as it so often is? 
	There is a tendency to throw the phrase into conversations and news reports without any context. What does it mean? How does it relate to China? 
	Here are a few thoughts: 
:: Political freedom 
	I met a tourist in Beijing the other day. We got talking. Politics came up. It had entirely slipped his mind that there are no elections in China. 
	These days, the country has such a dynamic and capitalist feel that, for some, it's easy to forget that it remains a one-party state. Its people are unable to choose who governs them. 
:: Freedom of expression 
	Not only are they unable to choose their government, but they are unable to question the government either. 
	Chinese citizens are far from free to express their political opinions. Since the new leaders took over in March last year (the fifth generation of continuous Communist rule) there has been a step change in the number of people detained for attempting to express their opinions either at gatherings or online. 
	Using the catch all phrase ""rumour-spreading"" the government has detained people in unprecedented numbers. 
	They include prominent scholars, academics, lawyers, even relatives of those who died in the 1989 Tiananmen Massacre. 
	Trials often take place in private - off limits to the media, which isn't free to report what it wants anyway. 
:: The internet and the media 
	Visitors to China are often shocked to discover that Facebook, Twitter, YouTube are all blocked in China. So too are several news websites. 
	On television, BBC World and CNN International both regularly ""go to black"" when reports about China are aired. A Chinese censor in a control centre somewhere literally presses a button to cut transmission. 
	All this in a country that is now considered a grown-up global player.  
:: Foreign reporters 
As a foreign correspondent in China, I find myself subjected to extraordinary obstruction in my attempts to report on certain issues such as trials, anniversaries of sensitive events, investigations into forced abortions and the persecution of Christians and Muslims. 
	We are intimidated, physically assaulted and constantly reminded that our visas need to be renewed annually. In other words: ""Behave or you're out"". 
:: The death penalty 
	There are plenty of countries around the world that use the death penalty, but according to Amnesty International, China executed more people last year than every other country combined. 
	Many had sentences handed down in closed trials. This week alone, it emerged that 13 Uighur Muslims were executed for offences ranging from arson to organising terror attacks. 
	The trials were closed and the fate of the accused only announced after the executions. China has 55 capital offences, including many non-violent crimes. 
:: Religious freedom 
	Chairman Mao is often quoted as having said that ""religion is poison"". Sixty-five years since his revolution brought the Communists to power in China, it's still not straightforward to practise religion in China - as we discovered in December.  
:: The one child policy 
	Concessions were made this year in China's continued policing of the one child policy. If couples meet certain criteria they can now have a second child. 
	Yet in many provinces and for many couples, one child is all they are allowed. If they fall pregnant again, the consequences can be, frankly, heartbreaking. 
	This is not an exhaustive list. Far more details can be found on the British Government's website. Their list certainly suggests that the UK isn't ignoring China's human rights record in favour of investment opportunities. 
	Indeed, diplomats tell me that the stronger the economic and political relationship, the easier it is to raise human rights concerns. 
	Still, in the context of what ""human rights"" means in China, it makes the visit with the Queen and the pomp on the parade square feel, for some, unpalatable. 
	A last point... 
	China is, these days, more willing than ever to confront the accusation that it has an appalling human rights record. 
	Its argument is this - the Communist leaders talk of human rights in collective terms rather than individual ones. 
	The Communist Party argues that it has ""pulled millions people out of poverty"" through economic and social reforms. 
	In that context, they say they have vastly improved the human rights of millions of Chinese citizens. 
	Others would argue that it wasn't the Communists who ""pulled"" the people out of poverty, it was simply the decision to ""unshackle"" them economically which allowed the Chinese people pull themselves out of poverty."

	Why? Because I felt others would think it odd - as they might not consider me to be British. 
	Once when my white British boyfriend (now husband) hung a flag from his balcony - I felt embarrassed. It just never felt right. 
	And today's survey suggests I was not far off. In the eyes of most people I'm not a true Brit. 
	I have got the passport; I was born here (in Scunthorpe); I speak English with a British accent; I even support England over India in the cricket. 
	Yet my lack of British ancestry means that I would not quite be accepted. 
	My parents even less so - despite holding British citizenship for decades. Their birthplace is something that holds them back. 
	It is a shame but I understand why it is the case. 
	If you are non-white with a dual identity growing up in Britain - it can be confusing. 
	It is the reason why if I am asked 'where are you from?' I am never quite sure what to say. 
	I usually reel off three points at once - I live in Hackney, I grew up in Manchester, but originally I am from India. 
	Perhaps that is the simplest way to deal with the rather confusing Britishness question."

	The discordance of sound that greeted Chinese Premier Li Keqiang as he arrived in Downing Street this afternoon reflected the disharmony that has surrounded his visit. 
	There were five groups of protesters in all - some were there to demonstrate, others to celebrate. 
	Hundreds turned out to welcome Mr Li and waved the Chinese flag in his honour. Most were students, mobilised by their universities and colleges to support the visit. Some said they had heard about the pro-China gathering through social media. 
	But who organised the delivery of their water bottles? Who paid their band to turn up and drown-out everybody else? Before she was silenced by an older gentleman, one young lady told Sky News the Chinese embassy were the ones to thank. 
	On the other side of no-man's-land (a five-metre gap, patrolled by the Metropolitan police) stood a group of 50 or so protesters, raising awareness about China's persecution of the Falun Gong. 
	Some were meditating in silence, others were shouting across the way to the pro-China crowd. 
	The Free Tibet campaign and its subsidiaries were flanked by campaigners against Chinese expansionism in Eastern Kazakhstan, and against the nation's oil exploration in Vietnamese waters. 
	Padma Dolma from Students For A Free Tibet claims she successfully managed to block Mr Li's convoy as it approached Westminster. 
	She said: ""Outside the Foreign Office we managed to jump in front of the car and the delegation and caught their attention. We could see them in the car. 
	""We had Tibetan flags and we were shouting the slogans 'Free Tibet' and 'China out of Tibet' repeatedly, and they could very clearly see us, which was great."" 
	The cacophony of noise that echoed through Whitehall all morning quickly faded after Mr Li's arrival. The pro-China rally was over within minutes - the PR war was over as far as they were concerned. 
	The others will probably be there all evening."
2014-06-20,London Tech Week: Do The Numbers Add Up?,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140620034445/http://news.sky.com/story/1283388/london-tech-week-do-the-numbers-add-up,"By Tom Cheshire, Technology Correspondent Michael Moritz – the investor who backed Google, Yahoo! Paypal and YouTube – came here to praise London Technology Week (LTW), but accidentally buried it. 
	Speaking at the opening event, he said: ""I come from Silicon Valley, where every week is tech week."" 
	London's tech scene has come on light years since 2009. But whereas Silicon Valley tends to keep quiet and get on with producing multibillion-dollar start-ups, London spends a lot more time talking about them. 
	The thinking behind LTW is sound enough. According to Kit Malthouse, deputy mayor for business and enterprise, it aims to promote London as a place for technology, attract more investment, attract more talent and cement London as a crossroads for technology – a place of exchange. 
	The problem is that each event like this – and there are a lot – comes with a new set of bombastic figures and extravagant claims that undermine the quiet, hard work being done by a lot of entrepreneurs. 
	Moritz was followed by Joanna Shields, a former executive at Bebo and Facebook who more recently helped put the Tech City initiative on the map. 
	She claimed that the growth in tech jobs – 27% of all new jobs in the last three years, apparently – was responsible for pulling the UK out of recession. Hmm. 
	This was followed by the claim that London’s digital tech sector is expected to create £12bn worth of economic activity and 46,000 new jobs in the capital over the next decade. 
	Or look at the pamphlet produced by London & Partners and distributed at the launch, titled At A Glance: London's Tech Scene. 
	It contains a handy map of 97 tech companies in London. 
	But look closer, and you'll notice many push the definition of what we understand as a tech company. 
	For example, games firm Electronic Arts, special effects company Framestore, and production house Endemol. 
	Most are not really London-based - as welcome as Facebook and China Mobile may be here, they’re not home-grown talent. 
	By my (forgiving) count, of the 97 listed, only 32 companies are actually based in the UK. 
	It’s depressing, because fudging the number like this only makes people suspicious of London’s tech scene, and London Tech Week itself, which has a number of very good events. 
	At the launch event, Boris Johnson was asked if these figures showed ""hubris"", or were ""overly optimistic"". 
	All of which detracts from the very good companies who have made London their home – TransferWise, Decoded, Mind Candy, Shazam, Deepmind (acquired by Google for $400m - £235m - earlier this year), King and Just Eat, to name a few. 
	For these start-ups, every week is indeed tech week. London should let them do the talking."

	Four unmarked police cars boxed in the suspect vehicle on the M275 in Portsmouth after believing it had been stolen. 
	And they suspected the driver was doing a runner when he rushed out of the car after being pulled over. 
	But instead Colin Ellmore opened the back door and helped deliver his granddaughter, Lola Mia Rose, at the side of the road. 
	Sergeant Simon Goss, of Hampshire police, said: ""We boxed it in, forcing it to stop, and when it did the driver got out and we thought he was running off. 
	""But he ran around the car to the passenger side and shouted something about a baby,"" he told the Portsmouth News. 
	""When we got to the car, we saw the baby in the man's hands. I have never experienced anything like it before."" 
	Mum, Tiffany, described the experience last Friday as ""quite scary"" but said she was proud of her dad. 
	The 26-year-old realised shortly before that the baby was coming and along with her partner Steven Read, their seven-year-old son Ralphy, and her parents Colin and Elaine, the family made their way to hospital. 
	""As the car was moving my waters went, then the police pulled us over and my dad came round and opened the door,"" Tiffany said. 
	""I knew she (Lola) wasn't going to wait and then suddenly her head started to appear. The whole thing was quite scary."" 
	Despite her dramatic entrance into the world Tiffany said Lola was ""doing great"". 
	Police have said no action would be taken over the incident."

	A host of film companies, including Universal, Disney and LucasFilms, all backed the £200m Project Pinewood, while the likes of London Mayor Boris Johnson and the British Film Institute have also come out in favour. 
	The Buckinghamshire site has been home to the Harry Potter and James Bond films and is where the next instalment of the Star Wars franchise, Episode VII, is being made. 
	The project, confirmed by the Department for Communities and Local Government, is considered critical to the future of the screen-based industries in the UK. 
	The plans were rejected by the local authority after a flurry of complaints that the development would wreck green belt land and put severe strain on transport networks in the commuter belt. 
	Pinewood is the only production complex of its size, scale and international profile in the UK, and its expansion has been deemed pivotal in encouraging growth in the industry. 
	The House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee recently described Pinewood's contribution as ""enormous"", and recognised how knocking back the plans might put scupper future investment. 
	They said: ""A lack of studio space is already resulting in the loss of international inward investment. 
	""Like other studios they need to build capacity if they are to respond to growing demand. We expect demand for studio space to grow significantly with the introduction of tax credits for high-end television. 
	""While allowing for local concerns, the planning system should adequately recognise the significance of creative industry infrastructure."" 
	According to a Government report, the project would secure private sector investment of nearly £200m, and the creation of 99,000sqm of new sound stages, workshops, production suites and associated production tenant office accommodation. 
	It would also create around 3,100 additional jobs, and described the case for expansion as ""compelling and robust""."

	Ofgem said nPower will be required to publish monthly progress updates until the problems are resolved. 
	The watchdog also announced it has launched an investigation into nPower's customer service failings. 
	It said that if it was found to have broken rules on customer service it risks fines of up to £300m - 10% of its sales - as a result. 
	It is the first case opened under the regulators' new standards of conduct and could lead to a financial penalty or redress payment if they are found to have broken rules. 
	With about 15% of the market, nPower has struggled with its billing system for the past year. 
	Many customers have been left not knowing what they owed and when as delays in billing mounted. 
	Npower has topped the 'big six' complaints table every quarter since the end of 2012, amid promises to improve service. 
	Ofgem senior partner in charge of enforcement Sarah Harrison said: ""Ofgem has been monitoring nPower's service closely and we have been increasingly concerned about the slow progress to tackle failings. 
	""Npower's recovery plan has not delivered as far and fast as is necessary. 
	""Our analysis of complaints data also raises some serious concerns which will be thoroughly examined in our investigation."" 
	In December, nPower was fined £1m by Ofgem and banned from door-to-door selling. 
	Since then the energy giant has halved the number of billing problems, according to Ofgem. 
	In response to the Ofgem decision, nPower spokesman Guy Esnouf told Sky's Kay Burley: ""We are confident we can get there. We are completely committed to get this right.

2014-06-20,Cameron Wants 'Global Push' To Fight Dementia,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140620034445/http://news.sky.com/story/1285076/cameron-wants-global-push-to-fight-dementia,"By Thomas Moore, Health and Science Correspondent A ""bold, global push"" is urgently needed to find effective treatments against dementia, David Cameron has warned. 
	The Prime Minister has told an international conference that 40 million people worldwide now have the disease. 
	And the number is set to double every 20 years, unless scientists find some way of slowing or preventing the slow decline in brain function. 
	The meeting is a follow-up to the first Dementia Summit of G8 industrialised nations held in December, at which politicians committed to finding new treatments by 2025. 
	""The truth is that dementia now stands alongside cancer as one of the greatest enemies of humanity,"" the Prime Minister said. 
	""We have to fight to cure it. I know some people will say that it's not possible, but we have seen with cancer what medicine can achieve. 
	""We need to join up the dots and create a big, bold global push to beat this."" 
	Global funding for dementia research is just one fifth of that spent on cancer. In the last 15 years only three drugs have been developed. 
	The World Dementia Envoy Dr Dennis Gillings, who was appointed following the G8 Summit, told  the meeting that pharmaceutical companies needed to be given incentives to invest in research, and encouraged to speed up clinical trials so patients benefit sooner. 
	""Just as the world came together in the fight against HIV/Aids, we need to free up regulation so that we can test ground-breaking new drugs,"" he said. 
	The Medical Research Council announced the world's largest ever study into dementia, with two million people in Britain invited to take part. 
	And Alzheimer's Research UK hopes to raise £100m to fund more drug research. 
	The fresh focus being given to dementia was welcomed by Alison Carter, who helps to care for her father John Fenn. 
	He was diagnosed with vascular dementia seven years ago. Existing treatments have done little to slow the disease. 
	She told Sky News: ""The idea that there are drugs out there which are now being looked at that could delay it for five years. If my dad could have five years back, that would be fantastic."""
2014-06-20,Miliband Fights Back After Poor Poll Showing,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140620034445/http://news.sky.com/story/1285351/miliband-fights-back-after-poor-poll-showing,"Ed Miliband's leadership is under increasing pressure after a slew of negative polls and comments from former New Labour stalwarts. 
	The Labour leader's popularity is now at its lowest, behind even Nick Clegg, who was previously seen as the barometer of unpopularity. 
	A YouGov poll on Thursday found that 60% of voters think Mr Miliband is not up to the job of prime minister - of those 43% were Labour voters. 
	The survey for Prospect magazine also found more people thought Mr Miliband's brother, David, would make a better premier. 
	An IPSOS Mori poll for the Evening Standard yesterday found 49% of voters thought Mr Miliband should be replaced. 
	Former cabinet minister Lord Mandelson failed to back Mr Miliband firmly saying he was the ""leader we have"". 
	Alan Johnson, former home secretary, further highlighted Mr Miliband's unpopularity by saying the Labour leader was not a hit on the doorstep. 
Speaking as he unveiled a new tough policy on benefits, Mr Miliband said he was happy he could ""defy the odds"" and win next year's election. 
	He said he would not provide ""continuity Labour"" and said he was happy to listen to the advice of people like Lord Mandelson, but added that while the 2015 election would be a tough fight, he was determined to win. 
	The results of the poll will, however, make worrying reading for the Labour party just a year out from the General Election. 
	Mr Miliband suffered a gaffe-prone local and European election campaign, forgetting the name of the Labour Party council leader he was campaigning for in Swindon and failing to get a handle on his shopping bill. 
	He was also mocked over unflattering pictures of him eating a bacon sandwich. 
	And more recently he apologised for posing with the copy of The Sun to promote its World Cup edition. 
	Asked on the BBC's Newsnight whether Mr Miliband was the best leader for the party, Lord Mandelson said: ""In my view he is the leader we have and therefore the leader I support, and somebody who I believe is capable of leading the party to victory."" 
	He said: ""What Ed is trying to do is approach politics in a rather different way from the way in which Tony Blair and New Labour approached it. 
	""It may work. It may well be successful. I would say to you that electoral arithmetic is probably on his side."" 
	He said the leader had some good policies but had failed to win through with his personality and needed to create a ""convincing vivid narrative"" about what he stood for. 
	Alan Johnson told the New Statesman magazine the Labour leader was ""not as able to connect (with people) as strongly"" as his brother David. 
	He said: ""It's not his strong point I can't pretend that, knocking on doors, people come out and they're really enthusiastic about Ed."""
2014-06-20,Dappy Found Guilty Of Nightclub Assault,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140620034445/http://news.sky.com/story/1285461/dappy-found-guilty-of-nightclub-assault,"Former N-Dubz singer Dappy has been found guilty of assaulting a man in an Essex nightclub. 
	The 27-year-old, whose real name is Dino Costas Contostavlos, had denied attacking George Chittock in the early hours of February 27 during a public appearance at Chicago's nightclub in Chelmsford. 
	Dappy claimed he lashed out in self-defence but was convicted by magistrates at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court and fined £800. 
	As well as the fine, he was ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £80 and costs of £930. 
	Chair of the bench Angela Tucker said the magistrates had found Contostavlos was not under any physical threat at the time of the incident. 
	He held his head in his hands as the verdict was delivered. 
	Summing up the case, prosecutor Jacqueline Carey had told the court: ""It is no defence for anybody, celebrity or otherwise, to say 'I lashed out because he was rude to me'."" 
	Mitigating, Jon Harrison said: ""It was no doubt a regrettable incident but one that was over very quickly and left a person red faced and very, very angry. 
	""He is a polarising figure who is clearly liked by a great many people but he is equally disliked by many others."" 
	On Wednesday comedian Jim Davidson turned up at the court to support his ""good friend"" at the start of the trial. 
	The pair met while appearing on the reality show Big Brother. 
	The court was read details of Contostavlos' criminal record, including a six-month suspended sentence for affray and assault in February 2012. 
	A trial last year heard how he sparked a ""mob-handed attack"" when he spat at Grace Cochran and Serena Burton, who were both 19, at a petrol station in Guildford, Surrey. 
	In November Dappy was left injured after being kicked in the face by a horse at his Hertfordshire home."
2014-06-20,Ian Wright 'Angry' As Family Burgled At Knifepoint,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140620034445/http://news.sky.com/story/1285266/ian-wright-angry-as-family-burgled-at-knifepoint,"Former England international Ian Wright is said to be ""really upset and angry"" after his wife and children were burgled at knifepoint by four armed men. 
	A blade was held at his wife Nancy's throat, while his children were threatened with having their fingers cut off, during the robbery on Wednesday night at the family's home in St John's Wood, north-west London, The Sun reported. 
	Both mother and children are thought to have been separated in different rooms during the burglary. 
	The gang are understood to have made off with cash and jewellery. 
	Steve Kutner, Wright's manager, told the newspaper: ""It was a terrifying ordeal. They marched Ian's wife from room to room."" 
	The 50-year-old former Arsenal striker tweeted last night: ""You won't get away with it!"" 
	Wright, who has been working for ITV in Brazil, flew home immediately as soon as he heard the news and arrived back at London's Heathrow Airport on Thursday afternoon. 
	He emerged briefly from his home earlier and told reporters his wife was ""feeling good that I am back"". 
	""All I want to say, really, is that my missus, my girls, everyone's safe,"" he said. 
	""The police are trying to get on doing what they are doing."" 
	A spokeswoman for Wright said earlier: ""Nancy is really shaken up. Their kids are so young that hopefully they aren't going to read into it too much. They are all physically OK - Nancy and the kids."" 
	She added: : ""Hopefully, with enough media coverage, this won't happen to any other players or people who are over in the World Cup. Ian is trying to get the message out."" 
	Detective Chief Inspector Mick Gornall, of the Metropolitan Police, who is leading the investigation, said: ""We are trying to trace these four men, and I'd ask anyone who may know anything to get in touch with my team and help us. 
	""Fortunately no one was injured during the burglary, but it is still very frightening to have people force their way into your home and threaten you. 
	""Last night officers went to the address and started carrying out house-to-house inquiries. We are also seizing and reviewing CCTV."""
2014-06-20,Rolf Harris Sex Accusations: Jury Goes Out,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140620034445/http://news.sky.com/story/1285471/rolf-harris-sex-accusations-jury-goes-out,"By Nick Pisa, Southwark Crown Court Jurors in the trial of veteran entertainer and artist Rolf Harris have retired to consider their  verdicts. 
	The 84-year-old is accused of indecently assaulting four women between 1968 and 1986, all of which he denies. 
	He insists the women made up their stories and jumped on a bandwagon as part of a celebrity witch-hunt following the Jimmy Savile scandal. 
	The judge, Mr Justice Sweeney, told the jury of six men and six women to consider only the evidence they have heard in court and return a ''true verdict whatever the consequences may be''. 
	As well as the alleged victims, the six-week trial at Southwark Crown Court has heard from seven character witnesses who are not part of the indictment but who claim they were assaulted by Harris. 
	Prosecutor Sasha Wass described him as a ''sinister pervert'' who groomed' women and used his fame to trap them in bear hugs so he could grope them. 
	She told the court he had a ''dark side'' after he admitted having a relationship with the best friend of his daughter Bindi, which began with him allegedly groping her on a holiday in Hawaii when she was 13. 
	His defence claims sexual contact between Harris and the woman, who is the subject of seven of the 12 charges against him, began after she turned 18 and was consensual. 
	The other three women say they were assaulted in Portsmouth, Cambridge and London when they were all aged between seven or eight and 16 years old. 
	Mr Justice Sweeney took the best part of two days to sum up the evidence and warned the jury to look out for ''red herrings when you see one''. 
	He told them the ultimate question they must answer is: ''Has the prosecution made us sure that the defendant touched in the way that was alleged?'' 
	Harris, from Bray, Berkshire, was accompanied in court on Thursday by his daughter Bindi and other family members. His wife Alwyn was absent."
2014-06-20,Virgin Trains To Boost West Coast Mainline,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140620034445/http://news.sky.com/story/1285398/virgin-trains-to-boost-west-coast-mainline,"Virgin Trains has promised to boost rail service on the West Coast mainline network, after winning an extension to its franchise. 
	It said ""significant improvements"" would be brought in as part of the franchise continuation until March 2017. 
	The increases will include conversion of first class to standard seating, free super-fast Wi-Fi and new services. 
	Virgin previously lost the franchise to FirstGroup as part of a new 13-year West Coast contract. 
	However the award process was stopped by the Department for Transport (DfT) over irregularities in the bidding process. 
	The decision allowed Virgin to run the line on a temporary basis until November. 
	Virgin is to pay £430m to the Government during the new extended contact, at a rate of £155.3m a year. 
	That is a 58% increase on the £98.1m a year paid in the temporary contract. 
	The West Coast service carries more than 30 million passengers a year between London, the West Midlands, Greater Manchester, Merseyside, Strathclyde and Lothian. 
	The operator said 21 trains would have a first class carriage reconfigured to standard class, boosting seating capacity by 2,100 per day. 
	It also plans to launch a direct services between Shrewsbury, Blackpool and London before Christmas. 
	The Office of Rail Regulation has previously rejected an application by Virgin to run additional services because of limited capacity. 
	Virgin will fit 76 of its Pendolino and Super Voyager trains with 4G superfast Wi-Fi. 
	Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said: ""This deal will provide thousands more seats and better journeys for the tens of thousands of passengers who use these services every day. 
	""The West Coast provides a vital artery between London and Scotland and it is crucial we do everything we can to improve services on this much-used route."" 
	Virgin Trains executive chairman Patrick McCall added: ""We're delighted to have reached a deal after some tough negotiations with the DfT. 
	""It puts the problems of 2012 firmly behind us, and shows the clear benefits of a well-run franchise system."""
