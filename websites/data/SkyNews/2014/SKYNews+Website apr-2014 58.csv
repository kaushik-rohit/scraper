2014-04-20,Teachers Warn Of 'Constant' CCTV Surveillance,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140420090620/http://news.sky.com/story/1245802/teachers-warn-of-constant-cctv-surveillance,"Teachers say they are being subjected to constant surveillance by CCTV schools supposed to keep pupils safe. 
	A poll conducted by the NASUWT union has revealed 8% of 7,500 members questioned said classroom cameras record their lessons and their performance is being monitored by school leaders. 
	The survey comes as delegates attending the union's annual conference in Birmingham discuss a motion suggesting there is too much surveillance of teachers. 
	It says the monitoring is unreasonable, without justification, and adds little value to pupils' progress. 
	The motion adds: ""Its impact is to stifle creativity in education, disempower teachers, put procedure before purpose and increase the workload of teachers."" 
	One teacher said of their school: ""CCTV has been used against staff to imply they are handling a situation incorrectly even though the CCTV has no sound."" 
	Another said: ""In my school it has been used specifically with newly qualified teachers that the senior leadership team think are not performing well."" 
	Nearly 90% of teachers who have CCTV in their classroom say they cannot switch the cameras off and 40% claim the recordings are monitored by school leaders and the footage used to make judgments about staff performance. 
	NASUWT general secretary Chris Keates said: ""Teachers are already wrestling with excessive monitoring, masquerading as classroom observation, carried out by senior management and a host of other people regularly visiting their classrooms. 
	""The stories teachers recounted to us in the survey are a shocking catalogue of professional disrespect and unacceptable intrusion. 
	""No other professionals are subjected to such appalling treatment; no one should be subjected to the stress and pressure of being watched constantly. Lab rats have more professional privacy."""
2014-04-20,Teen Thrown Around Ride Like A 'Rag Doll',https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140420090620/http://news.sky.com/story/1245797/teen-thrown-around-ride-like-a-rag-doll,"A teenager is recovering in hospital after falling 15ft from a fairground ride in Worthing, Sussex. 
	Beth Thorpe, 18, suffered bruises, head and neck injuries after slipping from the Rocker ride on Marine Parade on Thursday night. 
	A witness to the incident said Miss Thorpe was flung around like a ""rag doll"" during the ride before coming out of her seat. 
	Friend Faith Paine, 18, told The Argus newspaper: ""Seconds after the ride started she was flung about like a rag doll and started foaming at the mouth, immediately I knew something was wrong. 
	""She then started to come out of her seat as her body turned to jelly and just slipped out. I was trying to scream stop and help, but it was too late. 
	""It was without a doubt the most horrific thing I have ever seen in my life."" 
	The A Level student was later taken to the Royal Sussex Hospital in Brighton. 
	Her father, Robert Thorpe, said: ""It was traumatic for her and it's traumatic for us, we are just happy she is recovering, I could have lost my child. 
	""She has got bruising, cuts and grazes all over her body. 
	""We do not know exactly what happened, we weren't there, we just got a phone call and all we know is that she was flung out of the ride and she blacked out."" 
	A spokesperson from Worthing Borough Council said: ""Following an accident on a fairground ride at Worthing seafront our thoughts are with the woman injured in the accident and her family. 
	""We wish her a full and speedy recovery. We are grateful to the emergency services who attended the scene promptly. 
	""The fairground ride operators and Worthing Borough Council will fully co-operate with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and relevant authorities into the investigation that will take place. 
	""In the meantime, the ride will remain closed until HSE clearance is received to reopen the ride. At the current time we are unable to confirm when the investigation will be completed."""
2014-04-20,Nurse 'Lost Her Job Over Christian Beliefs',https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140420090620/http://news.sky.com/story/1245924/nurse-lost-her-job-over-christian-beliefs,"A nursery nurse has said she lost her job after telling a gay colleague her beliefs on homosexuality as a Christian. 
	Sarah Mbuyi said she made the comment after she was asked about her Christian beliefs by a co-worker at New Park Childcare in Highbury, north London, in January. 
	Andrea Williams, chief executive of the Christian Legal Centre which is assisting Ms Mbuyi, said the Government has ""seriously let down"" the Christian community. 
	Ms Mbuyi is claiming unfair dismissal on the grounds of religious discrimination. 
	She said: ""When I said 'no, God does not condone the practice of homosexuality, but does love you and says you should come to Him as you are', she became emotional and went off to report me to my manager."" 
	During an internal disciplinary hearing she claimed her colleague had alleged she raised the issue of homosexuality of a number of occasions. She was dismissed for gross misconduct. 
	Ms Mbuyi added: ""My disciplinary hearing was hopelessly one-sided because they put my accuser's claims to me as fact, without any forewarning and so I wasn't prepared. 
	""It seemed to me they had already made up their minds to justify sacking me, before hearing my side of the story."" 
	Ms Williams called for Prime Minister David Cameron to intervene in the case. 
	She said: ""Sharing Biblical truths out of genuine love and concern for colleagues is being outlawed in the workplace by a dominating cultural correctness. 
	""Sarah's case demonstrates the confusion we're experiencing in current times. 
	""David Cameron has given public recognition of the enormous positive impact that Jesus Christ has had on our nation but he wants to mould Christianity to his political agenda."" 
	In an article for the Church Times this week, Mr Cameron said Britain should be ""more confident about our status as a Christian country""."
2014-04-20,Prince George Goes Walkabout With Bilbies,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140420090620/http://news.sky.com/story/1245912/prince-george-goes-walkabout-with-bilbies,"Prince George made his first walkabout on the Australian leg of the royal tour when he met some indigenous animals at a zoo. 
	The youngster looked fascinated as he was shown a bilby - a rabbit-like type of marsupial. 
	At one point, as he was held by his father Prince William, he held out his hand to attempt to touch the creature which was being fed by a keeper who has named the animal George in his honour. 
	George, dressed in a blue and white striped collared t-shirt and royal blue shorts, looked a little frustrated and waved his arms as he was unable to reach the animal, which was about a third of his size when standing on its hind legs. 
	Just before he was brought out for the cameras, the Royal family had been shown round the nocturnal house where several of Australia's animals who are awake during darkness are housed. 
	Staff said George coped well and was interested in what he saw, reaching out to a feather tailed glider and staring intently at some hopping mice and an echidna. 
	He was later given a soft bilby toy, which he promptly threw on the floor. 
	The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who was wearing a lemon yellow Stella McCartney skater dress, were visiting Taronga Zoo in Sydney where the new bilby enclosure will be named after their son. 
	The Royal couple went on, without their son, to be shown a few of the zoo koalas. 
	The zoo keeper who showed them round the enclosure, Paul Davies, said afterwards about George: ""He was brilliant. He was regal. It was amazing how he coped with the dark environment of the nocturnal house. 
	""They seemed comfortable feeding (the bilby). Kate let him get really close. At one point he tried to grab the bilby by the ears. 
	""He was like any other child. He had a short attention span and wanted to go and look at something else. It was just like meeting any family."" 
	Earlier, thousands of well-wishers turned out to see the Duke and Duchess mark Easter Sunday by attending a traditional church service in Sydney. 
	The couple arrived at St Andrew's Cathedral in the centre of the city and were greeted - as they have been throughout their tour of Australia - by officials and cheering crowds. 
	Kate looked elegant in a stylish dove grey Alexander McQueen coat and Jane Taylor hat, while William was in a smart suit. 
	If a Sunday falls within a Royal tour, visiting members of the monarchy usually attend a church service joining local parishioners. 
	At the cathedral's steps, the Royal couple were met by the Most Reverend Dr Glenn Davies, Archbishop of Sydney, and the Very Reverend Phillip Jensen, Dean of Sydney, and chatted to the senior clerics before the service began. 
	The Easter service was private and the large group of media covering the event were not allowed inside. 
	A bilby is an endangered desert-dwelling marsupial, the name of which comes from an aboriginal language from New South Wales meaning long-nosed rat. There are only about 10,000 left in the wild."
2014-04-20,Cameron-Appointed Quango Chief Resigns,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140420090620/http://news.sky.com/story/1245772/cameron-appointed-quango-chief-resigns,"By Sophy Ridge, Political Correspondent A businessman appointed by David Cameron to head a £60bn quango has resigned after it was revealed he was declared bankrupt. 
	Tony Caplin was in charge of the Public Works Loan Board (PWLB) which provides loans to infrastructure projects. 
	Under anti-sleaze rules, anyone on a public body must inform ministers if they are made bankrupt. 
	A Government spokesman said: ""Tony Caplin was appointed to a number of public bodies by the Labour party. He was re-appointed to the PWLB by the Prime Minister. 
	""He should have declared he was bankrupt. This has been pointed out to him and as a result he has resigned."" 
	According to the Mail on Sunday, Mr Caplin was a friend of the Chancellor, George Osborne, who is a former chairman of the same City firm where Mr Cameron's father was a partner. 
	He previously worked for the Conservatives as their Chief Operating Officer, but Tory sources have emphasised he no longer has a role in the party. He has also left his post on the Medical Research Council. 
	Chris Leslie MP, Labour's Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, told Sky News: ""It is astonishing that the Prime Minister and the Chancellor could appoint someone who went bankrupt owing so much to the Treasury to run the Treasury's lending operations. 
	""For him to be bankrupted in 2012 and appointed by the Prime Minister as chairman of this key Treasury body the following year is surely a misjudgement too far by a Prime Minister with a track record of poor judgement in relation to his cronies. 
	""The Prime Minister and the Chancellor need to set out whether they knew about Mr Caplin's bankruptcy and debts to HMRC before making the appointment, whether it was a coincidence that the chairmanship was granted only weeks after Caplin was discharged as a bankrupt, and on which occasions they met with Caplin during the past four years."" 
	The Labour MP and Chairman of the Public Account Committee, Margaret Hodge, told the Mail on Sunday: ""This raises serious questions which should be investigated."" 
	Conservative MP Douglas Carswell told the newspaper: ""This proves the need for MPs to be given the right to interview public appointments instead of letting ministers hand them out to whoever they choose."""
2014-04-20,'Faster Than Farah' Runner Denies Cheating,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140420090620/http://news.sky.com/story/1245821/faster-than-farah-runner-denies-cheating,"A man accused of jumping over a barrier during the London Marathon to finish the race in an impressive time has denied allegations he cheated. 
	Jason Scotland-Williams, 34, told the Sunday Telegraph that stewards along the route would have made it impossible for him to cheat. 
	The Sun newspaper claimed there were allegations that the runner jumped the barrier just after the half-way point and rejoined the race at a later stage. 
	The suggestion is that by missing out a portion of the race, Mr Scotland-Williams was able to post an unusually fast time. 
	""I have done nothing wrong,"" he told the paper. ""Nobody thinks maybe I just trained hard. No one thinks 'maybe he paced himself through the first half and when the second half came he just let himself go'. 
	""All along the route there are stewards and people watching. There's no way you can cheat."" 
	Mr Scotland-Williams finished the second half of the route in one hour, one minute and 42 seconds - more than three minutes faster than double Olympic running champion Mo Farah and just three minutes short of the world record for a half marathon. 
	It took him two hours seven minutes and five seconds to run the first half, which meant his finishing time was three hours eight minutes and 47 seconds. 
	A spokeswoman for the marathon told Sky News that an investigation into Mr Scotland-Williams' results was under way. 
	She said: ""We are aware that unfortunately a few runners who take part in the marathon ... decide to take short cuts. 
	""We have a number of anti-cheating measures in place during the event itself to remove such runners, and then post event when we analyse split times from our extensive timing points around the course. 
	""This process is one of many that take place post event and usually takes between 10-15 working days to conclude. 
	""Runners who are found to have cheated are removed from the results and banned from future London Marathon events."""
2014-04-20,Secret Art Stash Hidden In Council Vaults,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140420090620/http://news.sky.com/story/1245776/secret-art-stash-hidden-in-council-vaults,"By Mike McCarthy, North of England Correspondent Publicly owned works of art worth hundreds of millions of pounds are lying unseen in council vaults around the country, a Sky News investigation has revealed. 
	Freedom of Information requests to local authorities reveal many simply don't know how many pieces they have or what their value might be. 
	Some of it is uninsured and only a fraction has been on display in the past 10 years. One council said more than 90% had never been on public display. 
	Now there are calls for authorities facing financial cutbacks to sell some pieces to raise much needed capital. 
	Respected art critic Rachel Campbell Johnston called on councils to sell pieces which rarely, if ever, go on show. 
	""These works are lying around, unseen, in store rooms, gathering dust, costing money. Flog them off!  Make the most of them and let’s hope that somebody somewhere can actually enjoy them,"" she said. 
	Sky News asked 10 authorities from across England to reveal what percentage of pieces were on public display, the total insurance value, and how many pieces have never been on public display. 
	Leeds City Council said it had no recorded information on how much of its collection of artworks (insurance value £150m) was currently on display. 
	Birmingham City Council's valuation was £235m but it refused to reveal which were the most valuable pieces in storage. 
	Liverpool and Bristol said their valuations were confidential. 
	Manchester said the valuation for local authority artworks was £371m but along with Nottingham and Southampton it refused to allow Sky News access to film items in storage. 
	Bristol originally told us it couldn't say what percentage of it's collection was on display but eventually revealed that it was 9%.  Sheffield put the figure at 5%.  
	Newcastle, which holds 10,000 costumes and textile pieces alone, currently has just 3% of items on public display.  
	Tyne and Wear Museums and Archives said that large numbers of the city's art collection was rotated or loaned to other museums and that many items were held for study purposes only. 
	Bradford Council, along with many others is cutting spending on frontline services due to Government spending restrictions. Some councillors on the authority have questioned whether the council should be art custodians at all. 
	Liberal Democrat Jeanette Sunderland said: ""One of the assets we have is a seriously underused, undervalued and underinsured art collection worth millions which nobody sees. 
	""I think it's right that councillors challenge the authority on what it is spending it's money on."" 
	But Labour councillor Susan Hinchcliffe said that the city had held its collection for about 130 years. 
	She said: ""It's been amassed by Bradfordians over all that time for the enjoyment of people in Bradford and I don't think this generation should sell-out just for a short term fix which is actually not going to solve a great deal."""
2014-04-20,Car Fire In Lion Enclosure: Family's Terror,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140420090620/http://news.sky.com/story/1245628/car-fire-in-lion-enclosure-familys-terror,"A woman has told Sky News of the terrifying dilemma she faced when her car caught fire in the middle of the lion enclosure at a safari park. 
	But despite the frightening experience and ensuing rescue of herself and two children, Helen Clements from Gloucestershire said it would not put her off going back to see the big cats. 
	The drama unfolded at Longleat, Wiltshire, which was packed with visitors enjoying the long Easter weekend at the time. 
	Ms Clements told Sky News what at first appeared to be steam coming from her car turned into smoke, and she alerted park rangers by sounding the horn. 
	They were rescued as flames began to engulf the car. 
	Fortunately, the lions kept their distance and were then cleared from the area to allow firefighters in to put out the blaze. 
	Ms Clements said: ""We went into the lion enclosure and it was very busy so were stop start, stop start, and the car just overheated and what we thought was just steam coming out of it then turned to smoke. 
	""So we though OK I think we had better alert somebody. 
	""So we went onto the horn. 
	""Then the flames came out of the car, and were obviously coming into the car. 
	""We then thought we had better get out the car, but obviously the rangers were saying get back in the car. 
	""Obviously for safety reasons. 
	""It was very difficult to know what to do. Get in the car or get out the car. 
	""It was a little bit frightening, and obviously the children were frightened at the time."" 
	She added: ""Luckily, because it was so busy and we were on the outside of the enclosure we couldn’t see the lions."" 
	After sounding the horn, she said help arrived within 30 seconds. 
	Ms Clements added: ""I would like to go back and see the lions. 
	""It wouldn’t put me off from going back. 
	""You can look back on it now and thank goodness we are all safe, but why did it have to be in the lion enclosure of all places."" 
	George Lear, 16, from Bristol, was just a few cars away when the blaze broke out. 
	Mr Lear said the lions were about 150 metres away from the car at the time. 
	""They kept their distance but didn't take their eyes off the fire and smoke,"" he said. 
	Another eyewitness Wayne Skinner, who captured footage of the car blaze, told Sky News: ""We felt worried for the family, with the car on fire and lions in the vicinity."" 
	A Longleat Safari Park spokesman said there were no injuries to people or animals."
2014-04-20,'Easter Normality' For Flood-Hit Village,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140420090620/http://news.sky.com/story/1245759/easter-normality-for-flood-hit-village,"By Frazer Maude, Sky News Reporter An Easter Sunday service will be the first in a Somerset village since floods hit the area in January. 
	Many of the homes in Moorland were evacuated in the middle of the night when its defences were eventually breached. 
	St Peter and St John Church in the village has not been able to welcome worshippers since it flooded, but Rev Jane Haslam said today's service will be a positive step towards normality. 
	""We haven't met here for worship since mid January because of the floods and the road closures and pumps coming in and out,"" she told Sky News. 
	""So it's felt like an awfully long time so this is a key symbolic moment, Easter Sunday, not just for us but for the whole community."" 
	The village itself is testament to the misery and disruption caused by the record floods. 
	Many houses remain empty as they are being dried out before any repairs can begin. 
	The main street is still strewn with the debris of walls which were demolished to relieve the water levels, and skips stand outside almost every house. 
	Ron Westcott, a flood technician for Richford's Fire and Flood, said: ""The majority of floods are flash floods. 
	""There might be several feet of water in a property but its usually gone within a few hours, or at most a few days, but is very unusual for a village to be underwater for three to four weeks."" 
	Resident Amante Witherick, like many others, is expecting to be out of her home for months. She is concerned not enough is being done to prevent it all happening again. 
	""We've probably got 18 weeks before the water comes again, before we've got the rain, and all I've seen is a few dandelions being pulled out of the River Parrett,"" she ssaid. 
	""I know they're 'so called' dredging but you can't dredge in 18 weeks, not with the equipment they've got."" 
	The Easter service is being held at 3pm at St Peter and St John Church."
2014-04-20,How Far Are We In The 'Decade Of Lost Wages'?,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140420090620/http://news.sky.com/story/1243747/how-far-are-we-in-the-decade-of-lost-wages,"By Ed Conway, Economics Editor It's official: wages have at last caught up with inflation. The squeeze is over. Or is it? 
	As ever, when it comes to economic turning points, the numbers can differ significantly depending on how you cut them. So let's break them down ourselves. 
	The figures most people are focusing on today are those for consumer prices index (CPI) inflation and average earnings including bonuses. 
	They show that in the three months to February, earnings were rising at an annual rate of 1.7%. 
	Meanwhile, in the year to March, CPI inflation (itself also an annual figure) was 1.6%. 
	There's no doubting this is a significant watershed: since 2010 wages have been rising at a significantly slower rate than inflation. 
	This has happened occasionally in recent history, but only quite passingly. The recent squeeze has been the longest on recent record - probably comparable with the period when Britain returned to the gold standard in the 1920s. 
	However, as you'll probably have noticed, those figures are for slightly different periods - if you're comparing that 1.7% wage number with the February inflation number, the two are the same, 1.7%. 
	Then again, the employment numbers are a three-month average: pick out the single month earnings figure and the number you get is 1.9% - well over the 1.7% CPI inflation number that month. 
	The pedantry need not end there. Exclude bonuses and wages rose at a mere 1.3% in the year to February. It's 1.4% if you choose the three-month average. 
	Using retail prices index (RPI) rather than CPI as your measure of inflation makes the gap wider still - though there are ongoing concerns over the way RPI is calculated. 
	All the same, ignore the quibbles and the broader picture is relatively clear. Wages are finally catching up with inflation. 
	But this isn't necessarily a cause for wild celebration. For what's really happened is that inflation has fallen sharply and earnings have stayed in more or less the same place. 
	Wages are still rising far slower than they were before the crisis, when they tended to increase by about 4% a year. 
	In due course, earnings should rise so they are comfortably above inflation, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). 
	The problem is that this does little to detract from the extraordinary amount of lost ground over the past few years. 
	In real terms, in other words adjusting for inflation, wages are now around 8% lower than in 2008. 
	According to the OBR's own projections, even though wages will overtake inflation this year and will accelerate in the coming years, real wages won't be back to their October 2008 level even at the end of its forecast horizon, at the end of 2018. 
	In other words, when it comes to real earnings, we are already more than halfway through a lost decade. 
	That in turn raises a very real question about when people will stop feeling the pinch. 
	There is little doubt that there is something of a spring in the step of the UK economy right now. 
	However, the chances are this owes far less to the recovery in real wages than to the fact that the housing market is booming again, and families are raiding their savings at a record rate."
2014-04-20,Farage The Underdog May Welcome Giant Attack,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140420090620/http://news.sky.com/story/1243004/farage-the-underdog-may-welcome-giant-attack,"The Times' series on UKIP expenses focuses on Nigel Farage himself today. 
	And although an angry sounding UKIP leader insists he is taking legal advice (one source is unnamed, the other claims to be misquoted), he is probably rather enjoying the fuss. 
	After all, UKIP surged to record heights at the weekend, reaching 20% in the polls just weeks before an election - the European elections at that. And it achieved the feat by painting itself as the party that stands alone outside the establishment, taking on the Westminster elite. 
	Being attacked by The Times, a newspaper it calls the ""mouthpiece of the political establishment"", fits the narrative rather neatly. 
	When your raison d'etre is to be the plucky underdog, an attack by a giant can sometimes help. 
	Although one might ask whether an MEP with a salary that is £80k+ and an annual allowance close to £43k can ever be characterised as outside the establishment. 
	That allowance is at the centre of today's claims. In his interview with Sky News presenter Dermot Murnaghan, Mr Farage kept stressing his European hand-out is different to MPs' expenses in the UK. True - but a bit of a red herring. 
	In both cases politicians are receiving taxpayers' money, and in both scenarios there is a set of rules on how that money is spent. 
	The Times quotes Mr Farage's own ""transparency reports"" (a good thing for him to have published) saying he spends over £15k of the money on office management and running costs. It then has sources saying his Lyminster office costs only a fraction of that. 
	Mr Farage refutes the charge - and is right that there are serious questions to ask of the sources being used. 
	But even so, it is perfectly legitimate for Sky News to ask him about those costs, including his own admission that the annual electricity bill is £3,000. 
	Murnaghan pondered if he had installed a sauna in the 620 square foot office, reminding Mr Farage that the average annual electricity bill for a family home is only a little over £1,000. 
	Mr Farage responded that there were machines, a bank of them, in fact."
2014-04-20,Fog Screens Could Herald Gadget Revolution,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140420090620/http://news.sky.com/story/1245789/fog-screens-could-herald-gadget-revolution,"By Adele Robinson, Sky News Correspondent Developers at Bristol University have invented what could be the future of interactive computing, involving fog screens. 
	It is believed to be the first time touch screens, made from fog and showing images in 3D or 2D, have been made to work with a tabletop device. 
	MisTable is led by Professor Sriram Subramanian and Dr Diego Martinez from the university’s Department of Computer Science. 
	Their invention lets users switch from interacting on a personal fog screen, to ""reaching through"" it and interacting together on the touch screen tabletop, or the space above it. 
	Sriram Subramanian, professor of Human-Computer Interaction, in the university's Bristol Interaction and Graphics group, said: ""MisTable broadens the potential of conventional tables in many novel and unique ways. 
	""The personal screen provides direct line of sight and access to the different interaction spaces.  
	""Users can be aware of each other's actions and can easily switch between interacting with the personal screen to the tabletop surface or the interaction section. 
	""This allows users to break in or out of shared tasks and switch between individual and group work."" 
	The personal screens, which work using projectors and mist, have been around for about 10 years, but their use with tabletop touch screens in 3D and 2D is believed to be new. 
	The team's research paper on MisTable is to be presented at one of the world's most important conferences on human-computer interfaces being held in Toronto from April 26 to May 1. 
	The invention is believed to have the potential to eventually change the way people interact and collaborate in the future. 
	If MisTable is developed further, there is a possibility it could be available commercially after five years. 
	Dr Martinez, who helped lead the project, said it could be used as an educational tool in schools, in boardrooms, and in the gaming world."
2014-04-20,Runaway Rhea Chris 'May Never Be Caught',https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140420090620/http://news.sky.com/story/1245566/runaway-rhea-chris-may-never-be-caught,"By Joe Tidy, Sky News Reporter The owner of an ostrich-like animal on the loose in Hertfordshire says she does not think anyone will be able to catch it. 
	The runaway rhea, a female called Chris, has been roaming the countryside for the last month since escaping from her home. 
	The 6ft-tall bird has spent the past fortnight holed up in the lush surroundings of Barkway Park Golf Club, near Royston. 
	Owner Joanna Clark, who admits finding her will be a nightmare, said: ""I keep getting told where she’s been spotted but I’ll never catch her I don’t think. I’d love my little girl back."" 
	Chris, who comes from South America, cannot take flight but her spindly legs can still reach speeds of 40mph. 
	Video footage shot by local green keeper Antony Lake of the rhea darting across a field at blistering speed shows why the animal has yet to be caught. 
	""I've seen her regularly and filmed her a few times,"" Mr Lake said. 
	""This video shows just how fast she is. I was running fast and got nowhere near, although a few of us have got quite close over the last couple of weeks."" 
	Gina Skutela, who also works at the golf course, said the bird seems perfectly happy. 
	""It's an impressive animal - the biggest bird I've ever seen and also very pretty,"" she said. 
	""She looks very relaxed, just grazing and looking around. A few golfers have even seen her sat down, chilling out near the fairway.""

	Preston Flores, who is believed to have suffered 80% burns, was reportedly playing with friends in Bedford Avenue when he was engulfed in flames. 
	The children are believed to have taken a petrol can from the back of a van shortly before the fire started, local newspaper The Press and Journal reported. 
	A police spokesman confirmed petrol was involved but said there was no evidence to suggest the ""tragic incident"" was a deliberate act. 
	Witnesses described hearing screams and said the youngster's clothes stuck to his body as neighbours tried to douse the flames. 
	One relative told the Daily Record that Preston had been ""mucking about"" with mates before his clothes caught fire. 
	""I've never seen anything so horrible in my life,"" the family member said. 
	""The flames were covering his whole body."" 
	Preston was initially taken to the Royal Aberdeen Children's Hospital but was moved to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh overnight. 
	He is being treated in a specialist unit, where his condition is described as critical. 
	Chief Inspector Nick Topping, the local Police Scotland area commander, said: ""We're grateful for the continued assistance we've received from the local community to help us piece together the events leading up to this incident. 
	""We've spoken to a number of residents about what they saw or heard which has been very helpful and important to our inquiry."" 
	He added: ""Our investigation into this tragic incident will continue and I'd reiterate that so far there's been no evidence of any deliberate act."" 
	Anyone who saw what happened or has information that may assist the police inquiry is asked to contact officers on the 101 non-emergency number."

	His injuries are not thought to be life-threatening. 
	Chief Inspector Jack Hadley, of West Midlands Police, said: ""Both officers were extremely lucky not to suffer more serious injuries.

2014-04-20,Frilly Socks 'Too Dangerous For Schoolgirls',https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140420090620/http://news.sky.com/story/1245349/frilly-socks-too-dangerous-for-schoolgirls,"A ban on girls wearing frilly socks and refusal to clear up dog mess in a playground are among a list of health and safety excuses branded ""ridiculous"" by a Government minister. 
	Health and safety minister Mike Penning has written to schools and councils to highlight the spate of bizarre mis-interpretations of health and safety laws, which have led to a string complaints from the public. 
	""Health and safety has long been used as a smokescreen by jobsworths who have little knowledge of the law and who want to fob people off with an easy excuse,"" he said. 
	Almost 300 people have contacted a myth buster panel set up by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) two years ago 
	Recent cases include a school in Hampshire not allowing a pupil to bring in a baby chick for a presentation due to concerns about bird flu, and a local council in Scotland banning dog shows from community halls. 
	Other cases involve a school in Gloucester telling girls not to wear frilly socks for fear of them tripping over, and a council near Manchester preventing loose flowers and pots being placed on graves. 
	Judith Hackitt, who chairs the HSE, said: ""I would urge all decision makers to take a step back and ask themselves whether a decision made in the name of health and safety, is actually just an excuse for something else. 
	""Real health and safety is about protecting people in the workplace from life and health threatening risks - it is not about stopping a child taking a baby chick into school, or banning indoor dog training. 
	""Own up to the real reasons behind the decision, don't just reach for the easiest excuse."""

	The 43-year-old was shot dead at a fuel depot in an industrial complex near the Peter Pan centre in West Belfast on Friday - the sixteenth anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement. 
	The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) tweeted: ""Serious Crime Branch detectives investigating the murder of a 43-year-old man in West Belfast yesterday have arrested a 26-year-old man."" 
	Detective Superintendent John Roberts appealed for information about a red BMW spotted near the murder scene. 
	He said: ""It was a brutal and barbaric attack. He sustained several gunshots to the upper body and I'm appealing for any information from anybody who knows who was involved in this terrible murder to contact police."" 
	Northern Ireland's First Minister Peter Robinson condemned the shooting. 
	He said: ""The small minority of people who want to continue terrorising the community need to understand that they will not be allowed to drag Northern Ireland back to the dark days of the past. 
	""They must be hunted down and brought to justice."" 
	Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness added: ""The people behind this killing are criminals and will further no cause through this shooting. 
	""Whoever carried out this act has nothing to offer the community and have no role to play in our future."" 
	Mr Crossan was the Continuity IRA's former leader and was believed to have been the subject of a death threat from his former allies. 
	He had been expelled from the group some years ago and was jailed for conspiracy to murder Royal Ulster Constabulary officers following a shooting at a police station in West Belfast in 1998. 
	The organisation has opposed the peace process which largely ended three decades of violence and transformed the region."
2014-04-20,School Strike Action Threatened By Teachers,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140420090620/http://news.sky.com/story/1245719/school-strike-action-threatened-by-teachers,"Education Secretary Michael Gove has been branded a ""man with a mad idea for every occasion"" as fresh strike action was threatened by teachers. 
	The Cabinet Minister also faced demands to quit at the National Union of Teachers (NUT) annual conference in Brighton. 
	Activists were debating a motion which called on the union to co-ordinate national strike action in the week beginning Monday June 23, if ""significant"" progress is not made in tackling a long-running dispute over pay and conditions. 
	This threatens to coincide with at least a dozen GCSE and A-level papers due to be sat by students, although union leaders insist they are not seeking to impact on the exams. 
	It comes just weeks after the NUT staged a national walkout, and raises the prospect of widespread disruption to thousands of schools in England and Wales in the summer term. 
	A final vote on the resolution was not taken, and it will be debated again later in the conference. 
	Ian Murch of the NUT's executive launched a broadside against the Education Secretary, saying: ""We need a secretary of state who believes in treating teachers properly and respecting their professionalism. 
	""Michael Gove, the man with a mad idea for every occasion. 
	""Michael Gove, the demented Dalek on speed who wants to exterminate anything good in education that's come along since the 1950s. 
	""Michael Gove, the man who says he wants to set schools free and then sends in the Spanish inquisition."" 
	He told the conference: ""We are here to do the public a favour, to make sure Michael Gove's days are numbered. Michael Gove you have to go."" 
	Proposing the motion, union executive member Jerry Glazier said: ""We must put maximum possible pressure on Gove and the coalition Government to radically change their damaging policies towards education, their damaging policies towards teachers and their damaging policies towards children."" 
	There was also a debate over an amendment to the motion, which called for the NUT to step up its campaign and make firm plans for two-day walkouts on two separate occasions in the autumn term. 
	The amendment, which was lost following a full card vote of delegates, also set out four key demands - an end to performance-related pay, a pension age of 60 for teachers, a £2,000 pay rise for all teachers and a ""significant"" reduction in working hours. 
	The NUT's campaign of industrial action has previously been condemned by the Department for Education (DfE), which said it disrupts families and holds back children's education."
2014-04-20,British Gas Bonus Claims To Be Investigated,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140420090620/http://news.sky.com/story/1245339/british-gas-bonus-claims-to-be-investigated,"Claims that British Gas workers have been paid large bonuses to inflate customer bills are to be investigated by the energy regulator, Ofgem. 
	It comes after a former employee claimed the energy company encouraged its sales staff to sign up charities, churches and small businesses to its highest-priced tariffs in order to boost their own earnings. 
	British Gas has strongly denied the allegations. 
	The whistleblower, who worked for the company between 2010 and 2013, told the Daily Mail the firm's policies were designed ""to rip off"" customers. 
	He claimed sales agent typically earned between £4 and £37 in commission per deal if they persuaded existing customers to renew contracts. 
	But by moving a customer to a more expensive deal they could earn more than £400 a time, he alleged. 
	""People were desperate to make the salaries they had been promised, so everyone inflated the prices,"" he told the paper. 
	""Scout clubs was a favourite one; churches, charities, small businesses, where people would just go for the maximum 5p notch-up,"" he added. 
	A British Gas spokeswoman said: ""British Gas strongly refutes any suggestion that employees are paid commission on any prices charged to residential customers."" 
	British Gas Business managing director Stephen Beynon said his sales agents are paid commission, but he denied any suggestion that contracts were negotiated inappropriately. 
	""This is a highly regulated market, and every part of the sales negotiation process is closely monitored,"" he said. 
	""Sales agents in British Gas Business do receive commission, but we are reducing its importance. 
	""We're leading the way in addressing the variability in price that customers face in this market, and we'll continue to do so."" 
	Ofgem said in a statement: ""There are strict rules in place which require suppliers to take all reasonable steps to ensure information provided is accurate and not misleading, and that sales activities are conducted in a fair, honest, transparent and professional manner. 
	""Ofgem is an evidenced-based regulator and we would encourage anyone with information that an energy company is not complying with Ofgem rules to provide us with this."" 
	Energy and Climate Change Secretary Ed Davey said: ""This is a very serious and deeply disturbing allegation that comes as we are doing all we can to make the energy markets work better for all consumers - whether domestic or businesses. 
	""The Government fully supports Ofgem's recommendation for a full market investigation. 
	""In the meantime, we'll continue to help people pay less for the energy they use, driving the competition that has seen the number of energy suppliers triple since 2010 and people switching supplier in record numbers."" 
	The allegations come days after Ofgem fined British Gas Business for a series of failures including blocking firms from switching to other suppliers. 
	Ofgem said British Gas Business would pay a total penalty of £5.6m of which £800,000 would be in fines, on top of £1.3m already paid to 1,200 customers who paid higher bills because they were not notified when their contracts were due to expire."
2014-04-20,'Church Has Harmed Gay People' Says Welby,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140420090620/http://news.sky.com/story/1245559/church-has-harmed-gay-people-says-welby,"By Sophy Ridge, Political Correspondent The Anglican Church has caused ""great harm"" to homosexuals and is wrestling with the issue of gay marriage, according to the Archbishop of Canterbury. 
	The Most Rev Justin Welby warned Christians in some parts of the world find the subject ""almost impossible"" to deal with and said it may even have led to mass killings. 
	Same sex marriage became legal in England and Wales last month but is not supported by the Church. 
	In an interview with The Daily Telegraph, the Archbishop said: ""There are different groups around the place that the Church can do - or has done - great harm to. 
	""You look at some of the gay, lesbian, LGBT groups in this country and around the world - Africa included, actually - and their experience of abuse, hatred, all kinds of things. 
	""We must both respond to what we've done in the past and listen to those voices extremely carefully. 
	""Listen with love and compassion and sorrow. And do what is possible to be done, which is not always a huge amount."" 
	He added: ""At the same time, there are other groups in many parts of the world who are the victims of oppression and poverty, who we also have to listen to, and who find that issue an almost impossible one to deal with. 
	""How do you hold those two things (in balance) and do what is right and just by all?"" 
	Earlier this month, Archbishop Welby said he had visited the grave of 369 people during a recent visit to Africa, where he said people believe that if they leave a Christian community they ""will all be made to become homosexual and ... will kill all the Christians"". 
	He also told of religious figures in South Sudan pleading with him not to change the Church's policy on same-sex marriage because it would mean they could no longer accept help from England. 
	However, he insisted in the Telegraph interview this did not mean the Church should stop discussing the topic of gay marriage following the recent UK law change. 
	""What I said is that I have been in places where that has been the reason given for attacking people,"" the Archbishop said. 
	""Now, as I said then, that doesn't mean that you don't do certain things. That would just be giving in to that kind of terror. 
	""You can't say, 'We're not going to do X, which we think is right, because it will cause trouble'. That's ridiculous."" 
	Although the Church is legally exempt from carrying out same-sex weddings, it is due to hold a consultation on whether to introduce informal blessing-like services. 
	Gay ordained priests have been barred from being wed. 
	However, this was defied when Canon Jeremy Pemberton married his long-term partner Laurence Cunnington last Saturday. 
	The move means Canon Pemberton may now face a disciplinary process for his defiance of Church rules."
2014-04-20,Big Increase In 'Stranger' Kidney Donations,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140420090620/http://news.sky.com/story/1245330/big-increase-in-stranger-kidney-donations,"By Siobhan Robbins, Sky News Reporter The number of people donating their kidneys to strangers has risen dramatically in the last seven years. 
	So-called altruistic donation first became possible in 2007. In that year, just three kidneys were donated but last year some 107 donations took place. 
	Tom Higgs, 13, waited for a transplant for five years after his kidneys failed. He had to have dialysis treatment 11 hours a day and he spent months in hospital until a donor was found. 
	""I would still be on dialysis but instead of having a tube I would have the needle kind of dialysis where I had to go to the hospital every day - that would have been even harder,"" he said. 
	Despite the rise in altruistic donations, some 5,650 people are currently waiting for a new kidney in the UK. 
	Tom Cledwyn, 28, decided to become a living donor, but he has no idea who the recipient was. 
	""Whilst my mum didn't have kidney failure, that doesn't mean that someone's mum doesn't,"" he said. 
	""Donating to someone I didn't know felt as compelling as if one of my friends or family members suffered from kidney failure."" 
	Only a kidney or a lobe of liver can be given by a living donor. 
	Although a major operation the lead nurse for living donation at the NHS, Lisa Burnapp, says most people go on to live a normal life after the operation. 
	""If you're healthy beforehand and you have two healthy kidneys you can safely donate a kidney and live a healthy life thereafter on a single kidney,"" she said. 
	It is hoped that by raising awareness of altruistic donations, more people will sign up to either become living donors or give permission for their organs to be used after they die."
