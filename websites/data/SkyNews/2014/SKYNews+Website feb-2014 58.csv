2014-02-09,Floods: Military On Standby As Water Moves East,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140209111534/http://news.sky.com/story/1208817/weather-uk-faces-flood-threat-for-days,"The military has been drafted in to build up emergency barriers against fresh flood risks as rising river levels move eastwards across the southern UK. 
	Two hundred Royal Navy engineers have been building a sandbag barrier measuring 600 metres in Datchet, near Windsor, Berkshire, along the River Thames. 
	Fourteen of 16 severe flooding warnings - where there is danger to life - have been issued for the Thames Valley area as the already swollen river is predicted to burst its banks in several places between Didcot and Shepperton Green. 
	Around 2,500 homes in the Thames Valley are at risk, according to the Environment Agency. 
	Lieutenant Commander Paul Barker was in charge of the engineers in Datchet. 
	He told Sky News: ""This is looking like an enduring task, currently these engineers have been on task all day and will be working into the night. 
	""This is a real task because the water is rising."" 
	The Thames Barrier was closed again on Sunday morning to protect communities west of the capital. 
Network Rail has warned that train lines in the Thames Valley are at risk of flooding from Monday as floodwaters move east down the river. 
	Forecasters have warned there will be little respite from hurricane-force winds and lashing rain that have seen hundreds of people forced from their homes in the South West. 
	Heavy rain and winds of more than 60mph over the weekend will die out by Sunday night, but the brief respite is expected to be broken by another storm arriving on Monday evening. 
	Prime Minister David Cameron chaired an emergency Cobra meeting on Sunday night and said ""every resource is available to help"" as authorities attempt to aid beleaguered homeowners. 
	There are nearly 200 medium risk flood warnings across Wales and central and southern England. 
	The Met Office has warned that river levels are expected to continue rising along the Thames, Severn and the Dorset Stour this week. 
	The Ministry of Defence has put 1,600 personnel on six hours' notice to help in the south of England. 
	Two other severe flood warnings remain in the South West, which has seen significant flooding especially on the Somerset Levels. 
	Another 20,000 sandbags are ready to be deployed to communities in the area. 
Somerset County Council leader John Osman said: ""Our main aim is to keep residents and their property as safe as possible. 
	""We are working tirelessly 24/7 to ensure residents are safe, our roads are as clear as they can be in these difficult circumstances, schools are open, school buses can operate and vulnerable people receive the care and services they need."" 
	A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ""Military personnel, currently mostly Royal Marines, continue to provide support in Somerset in areas affected by floods as part of cross-Government and multi-agency relief efforts."" 
	Sky News weather presenter Isobel Lang said: ""Another depression will track across the south through Wednesday night and early Thursday bringing gales and heavy rain, again a fast-moving system, but raising the risk of coastal flooding for Wales and southern England. 
	""Looking at the general theme through mid-February, no change is expected. With a strong Atlantic jet stream, further depressions are likely."" 
	It comes after Communities Secretary Erick Pickles blamed the Environment Agency for providing poor advice over the dredging of rivers to prevent flooding. 
	The MP said the Government may have ""relied too much on the Environment Agency's advice"". 
	According to the Met Office, this has been one of, if not, the most exceptional period of winter rainfall in England and Wales in the last 248 years.

2014-02-09,Tributes To Child Who Died In Flood-Hit Town,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140209111534/http://news.sky.com/story/1208685/tributes-to-child-who-died-in-flood-hit-town,"Tributes have been paid to a seven-year-old boy who died after emergency services were called to a house in flood-hit Chertsey. 
	The boy, Zane Gbangbola, was declared dead at nearby St Peter's Hospital. 
	Police were called to the property at around 3.30am on Saturday following a request for assistance by the ambulance service. 
	His father, named locally as Kye Gbangbola and aged in his 40s, and his mother, in her 30s, remain in hospital in serious conditions. They are not thought to be life threatening. 
	Fifteen people, including two Surrey Police officers, were also taken to hospital as a precaution. 
	The boy's taekwondo instructor, Anoop Hothi, posted a message on Facebook: ""My neighbours' little boy passed away ... He was such a lovely little boy, lovely parents. It was a joy to teach you martial arts little man."" 
	Police refused to comment on speculation the death was related to carbon monoxide poisoning, but advised anyone in the Thameside area in Chertsey who showed signs of vomiting, diarrhoea and fever to seek medical assistance. 
	But a statement from the Environment Agency on Sunday said analysis of water samples at the house had not revealed anything that could have led to Zane's death. 
	It said: ""Yesterday evening water samples were obtained from the basement of the property by Environment Agency staff and analysed overnight with support from Thames Water. 
	""Based on the results of the analysis, we have concluded that there is nothing in the water samples that may explain the cause of the incident. The Environment Agency is continuing to assist on the ongoing police enquiry."" 
	Access to the family's home was hindered by floodwaters covering nearby roads. Friends have described the seven-year-old as a ""lovely little boy"" who was looking forward to getting a new puppy. 
	A specialist team from the fire service was deployed to the scene to investigate the circumstances. 
	Nearby homes were evacuated as a precaution and people were advised to go to hospital to be checked. 
	Chief Superintendent Dave Miller told a news conference: ""It is very sad that a young child has died earlier today - our thoughts are with his parents who are currently ill in hospital. 
	""Police officers are currently with them and we will continue to offer our support during this difficult time. 
	""The cause of the illness is currently unknown but what I can confirm is that the people who were taken ill are from a very localised area. 
	""We cannot rule out that there may be a link to flooding in the local area and whilst the investigation is ongoing local residents should follow sensible precautions."" 
	Sky's Siobhan Robbins said: ""Many of those properties have been flooded over the last few weeks, they have been pumping out and because of that the local community have been gathering at the Kingfisher pub just across the bridge. 
	""They saw the family last night, they were chatting and they were in good spirits. 
	""Many local people are extremely shocked and saddened to hear of the death of a seven-year-old boy."" 
	IT worker David North, who works in Chertsey, said he saw a yellow hose hanging from a ground floor window of the property at the centre of the alert. 
	He said: ""I saw a yellow hose coming from the front window on the ground floor. Whether it was pumping out water or something else, I don't know. 
	""My understanding is that this incident was found out while evacuations were being carried out due to the flooding.""

2014-02-09,Weather: Climate Change 'To Blame' For Storms,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140209111534/http://news.sky.com/story/1208850/weather-climate-change-to-blame-for-storms,"Climate change is almost certainly to blame for the severe weather that has caused chaos across Britain in recent weeks, the Met Office's chief scientist has said. 
	Dame Julia Slingo said there was not yet ""definitive proof"" but that ""all the evidence"" pointed to a role for the phenomenon. 
	The Met Office's latest analysis finds that persistent rainfall over Indonesia and the tropical West Pacific triggered the weather system that has sent wave after wave of storms across the Atlantic to the UK. 
	It says: ""The severe weather in the UK coincided with exceptionally cold weather in Canada and the USA. 
	""These extreme weather events on both sides of the Atlantic were linked to a persistent pattern of perturbations to the jet stream over the Pacific Ocean and North America. 
	""There is a strong association with the stormy weather experienced in the UK during December and January and the up-stream perturbations to the jet stream over North America and the North Pacific. 
	Dame Julia told journalists the ""clustering and persistence"" of individual storms was extremely unusual. 
	She said: ""We have seen exceptional weather. We cannot say it's unprecedented, but it is certainly exceptional."" 
	""Is it consistent with what we might expect from climate change? 
	""Of course, as yet there can be no definitive answer on the particular events that we have seen this winter, but if we look at the broader base of evidence then we see things that support the premise that climate change has been making a contribution."" 
	Dame Julia said the southerly track of the storms had been something of surprise. 
	She said: ""They have been slamming into the southern part of Britain. We also know that the subtropical, tropical Atlantic is now quite a lot warmer than it was 50 years ago. 
	""The air that enters this storm system comes from that part of the Atlantic where it is obviously going to be warmer and carrying more moisture. 
	""This is just basic physics. 
	""We also now have strong evidence that extreme daily rainfall rates are becoming more intense. 
	""That is emerging in the UK records, and it is seen very definitely around the world in other countries like India and China. 
	""There is indeed as far as I can see no evidence to counter the premise that a warmer world will lead to more intense daily and hourly heavy rain events."" 
	Dame Julia warned that Britons should be prepared to face more regular extreme weather in the future. 
	She said sea levels were expected to rise by a foot over time, causing more problems for those trying to deal with flooding. 
	She said: ""That might not sound a lot, but when you are looking at storm surges, when you are looking at moving water from the Somerset Levels out to sea, it does matter. 
	""In a nutshell, while there is no definitive answer for the current weather patterns that we have seen, all the evidence suggests that climate change has a role to play in it."" 
	Dame Julia said that detecting when and how such storms developed would become increasingly important. 
	The Met Office is also working on modelling to establish the likelihood of the current weather patterns occurring without any impact from climate change.

2014-02-09,Environment Agency Slammed For 'Success' Claim,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140209111534/http://news.sky.com/story/1208838/environment-agency-slammed-for-success-claim,"By Joe Tidy, Sky News Reporter, in Burrowbridge Flood victims in the Somerset Levels have reacted angrily after a senior official hailed the Environment Agency's performance as a ""success story"". 
	It comes as the agency prepares to launch a major flood management plan to divert water away from areas already under water.   
	Director of operations David Jordan told a press briefing that the 5,000 homes flooded during the winter storms were ""individual tragedies"". 
	But he added: ""We need to recognise that 1.3 million other properties would have flooded if these flood defences had not been built. 
	""That is the success story, if you like, that we are talking about."" 
	Reacting to the comments, one Burrowbridge resident told Sky News: ""What the Environment Agency has done and how they've handled it has been atrocious."" 
	Another resident, who has been campaigning to get rivers dredged, said: ""They've been successful in employing some fantastic people on the ground but the overall management and the policies that have created this are appalling."" 
	The comments provoked an angry response from Tory MP Ian Liddell-Grainger, whose Bridgwater and West Somerset constituency has been among the worst affected areas. 
	He said: ""What a stupid bloody man. To call this a bloody success story. This is getting worse. 
	""This is absolute stupidity and arrogance. This is a tragedy and disaster. 
	""The Prime Minister said it is a biblical scene, and he was right. It's not a success story. 
	""This is an out of touch, out of control quango which is stuck in a time warp of arrogance and stupidity. 
	""I only want five million quid to dredge a river, and he is talking about a success story."" 
	This sentiment is a common one on the Levels, where Environment Agency workers have been praised for sometimes working through the night in difficult conditions to build defences. 
	It is the management that has been heavily criticised, with much anger directed at the agency's Chair Lord Smith, who received a hostile reception on a visit to the flood hit villages this week. 
	Today, the Environment Agency is expected to begin a major flood alleviation project to send some of the water down the River Parrett and into relief channels. 
	It is hoped this will divert water away from badly-affected areas like Moorland and Burrowbridge, but residents of villages along the relief channels have expressed concerns about the plan. 
	Ron And Jude Smith live in Aller and have been flooded four times since Christmas. 
	They said: ""It's an ambitious plan and if it works and the water goes where it should then great, but if it goes wrong, our village is going to get hit badly."" 
	Aller Parish Council warned residents of the works online, writing: ""We will be doing this in a controlled manner, with staff located at key sites, and will continue to monitor the situation 24 hours a day."" 
	Royal Marines are likely to help complete a large blockade of bastions in the village tomorrow before the waters are diverted.

2014-02-09,Charles And Wills In Plea To 'Save Wildlife',https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140209111534/http://news.sky.com/story/1208802/charles-and-wills-in-plea-to-save-wildlife,"Prince Charles and Prince William have created a joint video message urging people to support organisations battling to end to the illegal wildlife trade. 
	The father-and-son appeal comes at the start of a week of wildlife conservation activities by the royal pair, which will culminate in them attending an international conference on the Illegal Wildlife Trade. 
	In the video recorded at Clarence House, the pair speak in a range of languages, including Mandarin, Arabic, Swahili and Vietnamese, to get their message across to the world. 
	It starts with the Duke of Cambridge saying: ""We have come together, as father and son, to lend our voices to the growing global effort to combat the illegal wildlife trade - a trade that has reached such unprecedented levels of killing and related violence that it now poses a grave threat not only to the survival of some of the world's most treasured species, but also to economic and political stability in many areas around the world."" 
	He adds: ""This year, I have become even more devoted to protecting the resources of the Earth for not only my own son but also the other children of his generation to enjoy. 
	""I want them to be able to experience the same Africa that I did as a child."" 
	His father highlights how ""organised bands of criminals"" are feeding an insatiable demand for animal products much of it destined for consumers in Asia. 
	The Prince of Wales says: ""More than 30,000 elephants were killed last year amounting to nearly 100 deaths per day. 
	""In the past 10 years, 62% of African forest elephants have been lost. If this rate continues, the forest elephant will be extinct within 10 years. A rhinoceros is killed every 11 hours. 
	""As recently as 100 years ago, there were as many as 100,000 wild tigers living in Asia. Today, there are believed to be fewer than 3,200 left in the wild."" 
	The video ends with Charles saying: ""Let's unite for wildlife"". 
	The launch comes as the Duke is reportedly in Spain this weekend with his brother Prince Harry. 
	According to The Sun, the pair are set to hunt wild boar and stags on a private estate, but there is no suggestion that the hunt breaks the law in any way. 
	A royal spokesman said: ""The Duke of Cambridge has for many years been a passionate advocate for endangered wildlife and has campaigned tirelessly to help stop the illegal poaching of rhino horn and elephant tusk. 
	""His track record in this area speaks for itself."" 
	World leaders will this week discuss the threat to endangered species and attempt to agree a more co-ordinated global response to the issue. 
	Charles will give a speech at the London Conference on the Illegal Wildlife Trade being hosted by the Government at Lancaster House on Thursday. William will also attend.

	The Mail on Sunday said highly sensitive information, including customers' earnings, savings, mortgages, health issues and insurance policies, ended up in the hands of unscrupulous brokers. 
	The leak was exposed by an anonymous whistleblower who passed the newspaper a memory stick containing files on 2,000 of the bank's customers, it said. 
	He claimed it was a sample from a stolen database of up to 27,000 files, which he said could be sold by shady salesmen for up to £50 per file. 
	He estimates up to 1,000 people could have been ""scammed"" and among the victims are doctors, businessmen, scientists, a musician and a cleaner. 
	All the customers had sought financial advice from the bank, and passed on their details during meetings with an adviser. 
	Select traders were given the 'Barclays leads', the newspaper said, and from December 2012 to September last year a number of victims were persuaded to buy rare earth metals that did not exist, it is claimed. 
	A Barclays spokeswoman said: ""We are grateful to the Mail on Sunday for bringing this to our attention and we contacted the Information Commissioner and other regulators on Friday as soon as we were made aware. 
	""Our initial investigations suggest this is isolated to customers linked to our Barclays Financial Planning business which we ceased operating as a service in 2011. 
	""We will take all necessary steps to contact and advise those customers as soon as possible so that they can also ensure the safety of their personal data. 
	""Protecting our customers' data is a top priority and we take this issue extremely seriously. This appears to be criminal action and we will co-operate with the authorities on pursuing the perpetrator. 
	""We would like to reassure all of our customers that we have taken every practical measure to ensure that personal and financial details remain as safe and secure as possible."" 
	A spokesman for the Information Commissioner's Office said: ""It's crucial that people's personal information is properly looked after. We'll be working with the Mail on Sunday this week to get further details of what has happened here, as well as working with the police.""

	The 60-year-old man was watching the game with a group of friends when he was taken ill around 15 minutes into the match at Murrayfield. 
	He was treated by paramedics and taken to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, but died a short time later. 
Scottish Rugby Union president Donald Macleod said: ""We are extremely saddened to hear of the death of a supporter who attended today's Calcutta Cup match.

	As many as 960,000 employees were on sick leave for a month or more each year on average between October 2010 and September 2013, figures show. 
	More than 130 million days are lost to sickness absence every year in the UK, costing the national economy £100bn a year. 
	The new Health and Work Service will help employees who have been on sickness absence for four weeks to return to work and support employers to better manage sickness absence among their workforce. 
	The Government says it is expected to save employers £70m a year and cut the time people spend off work by 20%-40%. 
	Minister of State for Work and Pensions Mike Penning said: ""More than 130 million days a year are lost to sickness absence in Great Britain, which has a substantial impact on workers, employers and taxpayers. 
	""As part of the government's long-term economic plan, we are taking action to improve get people back into work. This is a triple-win. It will mean more people with a job, reduced cost for business, and a more financially secure future for Britain."" 
	The Health and Work Service will offer a work-focused occupational health assessment and case management to employees in the early stages of sickness absence. 
	GPs will be able to refer employees for assessment by the new service once they are absent, or expected to be absent, from work due to illness for four weeks. Employers can also refer employees. 
	The work-focused occupational health assessment will identify the issues preventing an employee from returning to work and draw up a plan for them, their employer and GP, recommending how the employee can be helped back to work more quickly. 
	The plan will include a timetable for a return to work, fitness for work advice, as well as signpost to appropriate help. Employees will be supported throughout their time with the service, so they can return to work as soon as they are able to. 
	It will also provide an advice service on the internet and telephone for anyone who needs it.

	The crisis has been as unpredictable as it is devastating and reporting on what happens overnight means as much time in a hotel searching social media as out on the road. 
	We quickly learned that satellite navigation systems are useless. Flood waters mean you often have to drive in enormous circles to get to where you need to be. 
	When the marines began sandbagging in Athelney we got close enough to see the lights of the operation but had to drive around for well over an hour to find a way across the water. 
	In 36 hours we have clocked up more than 300 miles but local knowledge gained from social media has really helped to get us where we need to be. 
	Once there, getting footage is also sometimes tough. 
	Cameraman Ed Bayliss says: ""Shooting in strong wind and heavy rain makes my job 10 times harder. 
	""Keeping your camera equipment dry as well as keeping the lens clear is a constant headache. The answer for me has been to wear waders and always carry flapjacks!""

2014-02-09,Wet Weather Here To Stay As Jet Stream Blamed,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140209111534/http://news.sky.com/story/1208067/wet-weather-here-to-stay-as-jet-stream-blamed,"Forecasters have told Sky News the unsettled weather that has brought heavy rain, strong winds and flooding is set to remain until at least the middle of this month. 
	After that, conditions ""may start to calm down and the second half of February could be slightly more settled"", said a Met Office spokeswoman. 
	The relentless wet weather that has pummelled much of the UK for the past couple of months has been caused by a powerful jet stream, experts said. 
	It pushed an ""exceptional"" succession of low pressure systems across the Atlantic Ocean, as powerful winds and a deluge of rain struck the country, especially southwest England. 
	There have been a number of major winter storms during December and January and the Met Office said it was the relatively short time between each one that has led to major flooding. 
	It said: ""It was their rapid succession, with further rain falling on already saturated ground that caused the significant flooding problems."" 
	There are amber severe weather warnings in place for southern parts of England until 11pm on Saturday due to another storm coming in from the Atlantic. 
	Forecasters warned people should be prepared for possible 60-70 mph winds on the coast and 50-60mph gusts inland on Saturday, and up to 3cm of rain. 
	Sky's weather forecaster Nazaneen Ghaffar said: ""For the next few days we will see further wet and windy weather. 
	""This weekend will see a significant storm system bringing severe storm-force winds on Saturday, giving huge waves, especially across southwest Ireland where they could reach up to 12 metres. 
	""This deep area of low pressure will continue to bring further strong winds and heavy downpours through Sunday as well."" 
	One of the reasons for the sustained wet weather is that the winds have been coming from the west. 
	Traditionally when they are from the east they can sometimes bring snow from Siberia at this time of year. 
	The Met Office also said another factor could be what is called the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). 
	This is a cycle, discovered in 1959, which involves a narrow band of fast moving winds like the jet stream which sits about 15 miles up over the equator. 
	The cycle sees these winds change from an easterly to westerly direction about every 14 months. 
	When the QBO is in its westerly phase, it tends to increase the westerly winds in the jet stream - meaning there is a higher risk of a stronger, more persistent jet stream with more vigorous Atlantic storms. 
	It has been in its westerly phase since early 2013 and the Met Office expects it to decline over the next few months. 
	The Met Office also said it was the wettest December and January period in England and Wales since 1876/1877 and the second wettest since records began in 1766. 
	It has been one of, if not the most, exceptional periods of winter rainfall in at least 248 years. 
	Despite the rainfall being concentrated in the second half of the month it was the wettest December for southeast England since 1959. 
	January was the wettest for southern England since 1910. 
	The jet stream is a narrow band of very strong winds which tends to move from west to east across the Atlantic, bringing our weather systems with it. The position varies within the natural fluctuations of the environment. 
	It is caused by the temperature difference between tropical air masses around the equator and polar air masses.

2014-02-09,British Suicide Bomber Rewrites Rule Book,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140209111534/http://news.sky.com/story/1208412/british-suicide-bomber-rewrites-rule-book,"Traditionally, producing a suicide bomber is hard work. In many ways it is a science, mixing ideology with hard-nosed military planning, and it takes a very long time. 
A Briton carrying out a suicide bombing in Syria, as has been claimed, pretty much rewrites the rule book in its entirety. 
	The Taliban and al Qaeda used the rich breeding grounds of Madrassas or religious schools, often in Pakistan, to identify the most vulnerable and persuadable. The boys had been at these schools their whole lives. 
	All terror groups or radical Islamist jihadi movements need a person with a fundamental belief but also a need to feel wanted, loved and ultimately venerated for taking the ultimate sacrifice and dying for a cause. 
	What is interesting is that Britain seems to have developed a knack of producing fast-track radicals prepared to attack the UK, such as the 7/7 bombers, and seemingly, now, abroad as well. 
	More often than not, likely bombers emerge from the most disadvantaged areas of the places they will ultimately attack; Pakistan, Afghanistan, Gaza and the West Bank or East Africa for example. But a Brit is a whole new ball game. 
	I have met dozens, maybe hundreds, of jihadist fighters in Chechnya, Dagestan, East Africa, North Africa and the Middle East over the past 20 years or so; all prepared to die for the cause but a just a handful prepared to blow themselves up. Basically, it is too awful to contemplate. 
	For the past few months I have focused on the growing number of British men and, increasingly, women travelling to fight in Syria, listening to their reasoning and tracking their path to actual conflict. 
	British Muslims have been carrying out civilian aid work in the region for a long time, but the emergence of British jihadist fighters and their willingness to die in a foreign country is a major change and has sent a shiver of fear through the security services in the UK who fear they will return utterly radicalised. 
	They see themselves as soldiers of honour fighting for the spirit of the Muslim Ummah, the pan-national Muslim fraternity that trumps their sense of Britishness or nationality. 
	""Morally I am obliged to be here. When you see the atrocities, really as a human being, it is a moral obligation,"" one member of a new British jihadist group in Syria told us recently. 
	His views reflected the thoughts of all his fighting comrades. But reviewing hours of footage and many interviews, it is clear that these fighters have a widely differing sense of expectation and very different views on what is acceptable on the battlefield. 
	""These guys are good,"" a member of the group told me. 
	""But there is some bad s*** going on inside Syria right now and there are some absolute lunatics, I mean like nutters, in there."" 
	Talking openly to our contact it is clear their exposure to fighting and some of the moral bridges they have to cross affects them very differently. 
	One told us of his shock at seeing the reaction of a friend who had just killed a Syrian believed to be a member of the government supporting Shabiha militia. 
	""His eyes were wild, he was in ecstasy. I thought: nobody should be feeling like that when they have killed someone. I suppose you do,"" he said. 
	By just travelling to fight, these Brits have crossed a huge moral chasm. They have decided to dedicate themselves to a life beyond most of our imaginations and left everything behind. 
	The giant step is the first to martyrdom. Few believe they will ever return home; another step to an acceptance of death. 
	For the first time the need for years of indoctrination, brain-washing and persuasion have been swept aside by people who arrive almost ready to take the final step. 
	If death is inevitable it makes the argument that there is little difference to dying on the battlefield or in an explosives-filled truck, so much easier to swallow. 
	Perhaps the British jihadists are taking that position. It will be interesting to see how many more are prepared to follow.

2014-02-09,Corrie Star Bill Roache's Life Laid Out At Trial,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140209111534/http://news.sky.com/story/1207594/corrie-star-bill-roaches-life-laid-out-at-trial,"By Mike McCarthy, North of England Correspondent The not guilty verdict passed on Coronation Street actor William Roache ends a public saga which began when he was arrested at his home in Wilmslow in May of last year. 
	The 81-year-old was initially charged with raping the same girl twice and later further accused of indecently assaulting four others. 
	Throughout the past nine months and in a trial lasting almost four weeks he denied all the allegations, insisting he had never met any of the complainants. 
	Roache was born in Ilkeston, Derbyshire, the son of a GP. After attending boarding school in Wales he was called for national service. 
	As a soldier he rose to the rank of captain but suffered an accident during live ammunition training which permanently damaged his hearing. 
	Leaving the army aged 26, he took several minor acting roles before joining the original cast of Coronation Street as Ken Barlow. 
	But as his star rose, his personal life began to suffer. 
	In the mid-Sixties Roache had two children with first wife and actress Anna Cropper but the pressure of often being apart due to work meant their marriage failed. 
	It was during this period that one woman, now 62, said the star had pushed her onto a bed before raping her in his Lancashire bungalow. 
	The woman said the attack took place when she was 15 years old in 1967 and claimed that she was raped again later the same year after entering a nearby cottage also owned by Roache. 
	Roache admitted in court that he had been unfaithful and had taken lovers back to his bungalow at the time but he denied ever having a sexual interest in underage girls. 
	In a statement to police on June 6, 2013 following his arrest he wrote: ""I say that I am a very sensitive and caring person. I have always fully respected the rights and wishes of other people. I wouldn't dream of forcing myself sexually on to any person."" 
	He went on: ""It is correct to say that I have, during my career, been in a position whereby a large number of women have indicated a desire to have a relationship with me, often a sexual one. 
	""I do enjoy having sex with women. I accept that I have taken the opportunity to have sex with many women. 
	""However, this has always, and without exception, been with the woman's full and unconditional consent."" 
	Roache met his second wife Sara Mottram in 1971 and from then on was ""totally and absolutely faithful"". 
	Tragically, the second of their three children died aged 18 months of bronchial pneumonia. 
	In 2009 tragedy struck again when his second wife died suddenly from a heart condition aged just 58. 
	A year later he began a relationship with TV weathergirl Emma Jesson, 36 years his junior, but after three years they split, reportedly because Roache wanted to concentrate on his ""spiritual path"". 
	Roache is the world's longest serving actor in a single role and was awarded an MBE in 2001 – but he has sometimes courted controversy. 
	In a TV interview he talked about his years of drinking and womanising, coyly giving no denial when the figure of 1,000 lovers was put to him. 
	The actor was once famously photographed in Druid clothing and is a spiritualist who believes in reincarnation. 
	His beliefs raised eyebrows when he was asked by a New Zealand television interviewer last year whether he believed abuse victims brought their predicaments on themselves. 
	He replied: ""No, not quite ... and yet yes in that everything that happens to us has been a result of what we have been in previous lives or whatever."" 
	Asked by Sky News to clarify his position he said: ""If you're going to pin me down and start saying all victims deserve what they're getting then no - I am not saying that."" 
	In his trial defence barrister Louise Blackwell QC said the spectre of Jimmy Savile and an unhealthy interest in sending celebrities to court for sex offences haunted the trial. 
	Questions are now likely to be raised as to whether in such cases the pendulum may have swung too far towards accusations from the alleged victims of historic sexual abuse.

2014-02-09,Lungs Of Donors Who Smoke 'Can Save Lives',https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140209111534/http://news.sky.com/story/1208800/lungs-of-donors-who-smoke-can-save-lives,"By Tadhg Enright, Sky News Reporter The smoker status of lung donors has no impact on the survival rates of patients who receive their organs, according to a study. 
	Researchers at London's Harefield Hospital's transplant specialist centre examined 237 lung transplants between 2007 and 2012 and found no difference in the one to three year survival rates of those who received a transplant from a smoker. 
	Demand for donated lungs far outstrips supply and given that roughly half the population are either current or former smokers, their donations cannot be turned away. 
	In the hospital's study, 47% of transplanted lungs had come from smokers. 
	Of those 18% came from people who had smoked 20 cigarettes a day for 20 years or more. 
	After a year the survival rate for patients with smokers' lungs was almost 91%. 
	For those with non-smokers' lungs, the survival rate was lower at almost 78% but after three years the survival rates evened out. 
	The research's author, Dr Andre Simon, told Sky News: ""While you shouldn't smoke, you can donate lungs when you are a smoker and actually it is safe to transplant them too. 
	""There is a misconception and if I did not know the facts I would be there too, I would say: 'Oh Jeez, smokers' lungs? Can't be good!'  But that's not the case."" 
	Vanessa Bradle, 41, is recovering well from a lung transplant she had last year.  
	Like most patients, Vanessa does not know the identity or the smoker status of her donor. 
	""One of the things I was concerned about was a smoker's lung but the fact that the surgeon was looking at the lung to make sure it was a healthy lung reassured me and I was in desperate need of a transplant so I was prepared to take a healthy lung."" 
	Ms Bradle could have opted not to receive a lung donated by a smoker but would have had to wait longer for her transplant. 
	The shortage is so severe that for every two survivors, one patient will die while waiting for a suitable organ. 
	This research should offer some reassurance that smokers' lungs can save lives.

	The trio from the unit which protects Downing Street were detained on December 19 last year on suspicion of accessing extreme images. 
	They were taken to a central London police station for questioning and had their homes searched. 
	One officer from Metropolitan Police's SO6 Diplomatic Protection Group (DPG) was suspended from duty. 
	Two others were placed on restricted duties. 
	The alleged exchange of the pornographic images was reportedly uncovered during the investigation into the Plebgate scandal. 
	The officers have now been told there will be ""no further action regarding criminal matters but they remain subject to a misconduct investigation"", said a Scotland Yard spokesman. 
	A fourth officer, who was interviewed over the accusations in January, was also placed on restricted duties. 
	A decision has yet to be made by the Crown Prosecution Service regarding criminal charges against that officer. 
	The alleged images were of an ""extreme sexual nature"" but do not involve children. 
	Specialist officers in the Diplomatic Protection Group search visitors heading into Downing Street and New Scotland Yard. 
	Members of the Government along with former prime ministers and some former government ministers are among those who would be protected by the DPG. 
	The DPG is also responsible for guarding sensitive sites such as embassies and missions along with the residential protection for visiting heads of state, heads of government and foreign ministers. 
	It is also involved in surveillance at events which have been identified as high risk and at diplomatic functions or key sites. 
	These officers also provide specialist counter-terrorism searches at sensitive addresses, major events and crime scenes.

	Downing Street said there was ""no suggestion that Mr Harper knowingly employed an illegal immigrant"", but Prime Minister David Cameron ""accepted his resignation with regret"". 
	The Forest of Dean MP made the decision after being told the cleaner for his London flat did not have indefinite leave to remain in the UK. 
	He admitted he ""should have checked more thoroughly"" that the documents provided to him when he took her on in 2007 were genuine - a copy of her passport and a Home Office letter which said she was allowed to stay. 
	Mr Harper decided against checking her status twice after that - when he was appointed a Cabinet Office minister in 2010 and after being named immigration minister two years ago. 
	The former minister said he thought it was ""prudent"" to check her status again last year as the Immigration Bill was going through Parliament. 
	The legislation doubles the fines for employers who take on illegal immigrants without proper checks. 
	He was unable to find the original documents so asked for further copies from the cleaner. 
	These were checked by immigration officials, who discovered she was not in fact cleared to work. The matter has now been passed to Immigration Enforcement. 
	In a letter to Mr Cameron, he apologised for any embarrassment caused and said it was best for him to return to the backbenches. 
	""Although I complied with the law at all times, I consider that as Immigration Minister, who is taking legislation through Parliament which will toughen up our immigration laws, I should hold myself to a higher standard than expected of others,"" he wrote. 
	Mr Cameron said he had ""taken an honourable decision"" and hoped to see him return to government ""before too long"". 
	""I have always enormously appreciated your energy and your loyalty. It is typical of you that you should be so mindful of the wider interests of the Government and the Party in reaching the decision that you have, and I am very grateful for that."" 
	Home Secretary Theresa May said she was ""extremely sorry"" to see Mr Harper go. 
	""Mark has been an excellent minister and he can be proud of the role he has played in sharply reducing immigration to Britain. 
	""He has been a first-rate colleague and his decision reflects his loyal commitment to the Conservative Party, the Government and the Prime Minister."" 
	Junior Home Office minister James Brokenshire will replace him. 
	Shadow immigration minister David Hanson said he respected the decision but added it highlighted gaps in the system ""as it's clear there are limits to the effectiveness of relying on employer and landlord checks to address illegal immigration"".

	While the flood waters swelled around them, drinkers at the King Alfred pub in Burrowbridge let their hair down for the first time in weeks and started to hope that the worst was behind them. 
	One resident from the village said: ""It is looking as though after all the visits, maybe something will start to happen, but it's been a long time coming and I just think for all the people, it's just so sad."" 
	Earlier on Friday, David Cameron visited residents of the flood-hit region and said that mistakes were made in the past which have contributed to the crisis. 
	In the King Alfred, a customer responded to the visit and promise of extra aid saying: ""We understand that there's a lot of new pumps brought in which are going to be working in a couple of days - you've just got to feel sorry for all the farmers and the people in the villages that are really suffering - it's desperate times for them, desperate."" 
	The King Alfred pub, which sits alongside the River Parrett, has been a focal point for the flood crisis. 
	Landlord Jim Winkworth has been outspoken about his anger that dredging wasn't carried out after the last floods hit a year ago. 
	He told Sky News that the floods have cut off many of his regular customers and he's losing more than £2,000 a week as a result. 
	On Friday night, he spent most of the evening using his jeep to ferry people to and from villages cut off by water too deep for cars. 
	He said: ""It's been a busy night, a lot of back and forth but how else am I going to get people in the pub?"" 
	Speaking following widespread criticism of the Government's response to the crisis, the Prime Minister said it was ""wrong"" to stop dredging in the Levels in the 1990s, adding: ""We need to get dredging again."" 
	He also promised an increase in money to support efforts.

	Football League clubs voted on Thursday to lobby Government for a change in the law that would allow clubs in the Championship to install ""safe standing"" areas in their grounds. 
	Margaret Aspinall, chairman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, told Sky News she remains totally opposed to any form of standing. 
	Under current laws introduced following the disaster, clubs in the Championship and Premier League have to play in all-seater stadiums. Clubs in League One and Two are allowed terraces. 
	Now Football League clubs want to explore the use of ""rail seats"", widely used in Europe, to allow fans to stand in safety. 
	The seats convert into a standing area, with a hand rail behind every seat to prevent crowd surges or crushing. They are used in the Bundesliga, where Borussia Dortmund's Westfalenstadium has a single stand that holds 20,000 people in standing configuration. 
	But Ms Aspinall said that any return to standing would be a step backwards. 
	""I think it is a disgrace and I will be writing to many of those Football League clubs to reconsider what they are thinking of doing,"" she said. 
	""We have seen at Hillsborough what can happen when things go wrong. 
	""We have come 10 steps forward since then and I do not know why anyone would want to go backwards. 
	""I will never change my mind about standing and we will always be opposed."" 
	The Football League confirmed the clubs had asked the executive to begin discussions with the sports minister and the Sports Grounds Safety Authority over introducing rail seating in the Championship. 
	Chief executive Shaun Harvey said: ""The consultation has given us a better understanding of the wide range of views held by clubs on this issue and we will take our cue from the prevailing opinion. 
	""We recognise this is both a complicated and sensitive matter that will need significant debate. 
	""Therefore, no-one should assume it will lead to overnight change.""

	Some rates are fixed as low as 2.4%, though these types of deals do require a large deposit of around 40%. 
	Rates have been driven down partly by the growing number of people renting city properties, while lenders are slashing rates to attract new customers. 
	David Whittaker from Mortgages for Business told Sky News: ""Landlords were squeezed out of the market at the onset of the credit crunch. 
	""They wanted to be borrowing and they wanted to be acquiring properties but there was no funding available to them. 
	""The extent to which we are seeing a boom today, it is now their chance to borrow funds from more lenders in the market who are active in the buy-to-let space."" 
	The reduction in rates, and steady rise over 2013 in buy-to-let lending, is fuelling fierce competition between landlords and would-be first-time buyers. 
	The rental market is also contributing to the competition due to a wider reversal in the trend of home ownership. 
	Roughly 10 million people now live in homes rented from private landlords. That's double the number who did back in 2000. 
	In addition, lenders are increasingly keen to attract new business and are reducing their rates. 
	The Office for Budget Responsibility, the Government's preferring think-tank, forecasts house prices will rise by 27% by 2018 and property investors want to profit from that growth. 
	Research by Mortgages for Business found that 57% of buy-to-let landlords wanted to buy more properties this year alone. 
	While many economists expect interest rates to rise sooner than expected, and that would help slow the buy-to-let boom, it's unlikely to come soon enough for first-time buyers currently facing such stiff competition.

	""There is no such thing as guilt by association. Ignore as irrelevant any allegations that have been made about others."" 
	Referring to the historical nature of the alleged incidents, Judge Leonard said: ""A lot has been made of the attitudes to sexual offences in the Seventies.""

	Gary Bromige, also known as Gary Cody, was on his way to a Krispy Kreme doughnuts shop with four friends in the early hours of September 20 last year when traffic police tried to stop him on Reigate Avenue in Sutton, South London. 
	PC Andy Duncan stepped out in an attempt to pull him over, but Bromige ran down the father-of-two in his black Volkswagen Golf, throwing him 30 metres and leaving him with fatal injuries. 
	The Metropolitan Police officer, who had been with the force for 23 years, died in hospital two days later. 
	Bromige was quoted as saying everyone was in the car ""having the banter"". 
	Jonathan Rees QC, prosecuting, said the speed of the Golf before Bromige braked was 80-88mph and if he had been travelling at the speed limit he would have been able to stop. 
	He drove away from the scene and abandoned the car. 
	The court heard Bromige rang his father and told him he had ""done it this time"". His father told him to hand himself in, which he did that day. 
	Kingston Crown Court was told Bromige was heard saying in prison: ""Prison is easy. I've got my telly. Don't care how long I get."" He kept newspaper clippings of the incident in his cell and showed them to other inmates.  
	A prison officer said Bromige asked him: ""Do you know who I am? I'm the one on the news. The one who ran the policeman over. I'm probably on telly all over the world."" 
	Bromige pleaded guilty in December to causing death by dangerous driving, causing death while uninsured, causing death while unlicensed, failing to stop at the scene of an accident and failing to report an accident.

	Mr Duncan's wife Claire said their lives had been ""changed completely"" by his ""devastating"" death.

	Speaking after chairing a meeting of the Government's emergency Cobra committee, the Prime Minister highlighted the ""extensive efforts"" under way to protect and repair properties and transport links. 
	He also praised all those involved in the response to the crisis. 
	It came amid a fresh warning that communities could face further misery from rising water levels with more rain forecast. 
	Severe flood warnings remain in place along the Thames and in Somerset. 
	Meanwhile, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond admitted the military could have been brought in earlier to help deal with the winter storms that have wrought havoc across the country and claimed a number of lives. 
	Two people died on Friday - James Swinstead, 85, an elderly passenger on a cruise ship in the English Channel, and minicab driver Julie Sillitoe, 49, whose car was hit by falling masonry in central London. 
	A 65-year-old man in West Cork, Ireland, was killed after being hit by a pole while repairing damage for a phone company. 
	A 20-year-old pregnant woman and her unborn baby, from Tredegar, South Wales, also died in a crash on the A465 between Brynmawr and Garnlydan. 
	The Government has now deployed more than 3,000 troops to help with flood relief and made 5,000 more available if needed. 
	David Cameron also unveiled a £10m Business Support Scheme to help smaller firms with the flood clean up and to ensure they can carry on trading. 
	A helpline - on 0300 456 3565 - is also being set up to give advice to businesses. 
	The Environment Agency continues to use massive pumps to take water away from the Somerset Moorlands and some of the affected parts of the Thames Valley. 
	In the meantime, Thames Water has apologised to customers in the Cheltenham area who have experienced problems with their mains supply over the weekend. 
	The company blamed power cuts causing a pumping station to fail but said this had now been fixed. 
	Despite a respite in the weather, swathes of the UK remain on alert. 
	With the ground already saturated, there are concerns water levels will respond quickly to further rainfall. 
	While the rain would not be at the same level recently seen, Mr Cameron warned: ""This additional rainfall will add to high groundwater levels and will impact slow feeding rivers over the days ahead."" 
	He added: ""I'm hopeful the work to strengthen long-term flood defences and the emergency measures which have been put in place over recent days and weeks will mean we can minimise the number of homes and businesses affected by the latest high water levels. 
	""The recent flooding has been a tragedy for all those affected and my thoughts are with them. 
	""While it is of no comfort to those individuals, over 1.3 million other homes have been protected since December and we'll continue to invest in flood defence measures to protect even more. 
	""Extensive efforts to protect and repair properties and infrastructure are ongoing by many thousands of people among agencies, the military and the emergency services. I speak for us all when I thank them profusely for their hard work."" 
	The Prime Minister also said one million homes have now had power restored. 
	The Thames Barrier was closed for a record 18th consecutive time on Sunday and Kent Police said properties remained at risk of flooding in many areas.

2014-02-16,Miliband Issues Climate Change Warning,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140216183329/http://news.sky.com/story/1212280/miliband-issues-climate-change-warning,"By Anushka Asthana, Political Correspondent Britain is ""sleepwalking"" into a crisis in which people's homes, businesses and livelihoods will be destroyed by more extreme weather events, Ed Miliband has warned. 
	The Labour leader said ""the science is clear"" that climate change is to blame for floods that have swept across the country - and will lead to more such events. 
	Yet political divisions mean the country is failing to act and instead heading into a ""national security crisis"". 
	In an interview with the Observer newspaper, he argued: ""Storms and severe weather conditions that we have might have expected to occur once in 100 years, say, in the past, may now be happening more frequently and the reason is ... that the climate is changing."" 
	The second wettest winter in 2012 and this winter's one in 250-year event led him to one conclusion, he added. 
	""If you keep throwing the dice and you keep getting sixes then the dice are loaded. Something is going on."" 
	Conservative Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: ""Climate change is clearly happening, it is clearly a factor in the weather patterns that we are seeing. 
	""That's why we are investing significant amounts of money in increasing our flood resilience in the UK. 
	""Of course these floods are a terrible tragedy for all the people affected, but we shouldn't forget that hundreds of thousands of properties have been protected from flooding by the investment we've made over recent years."" 
	Mr Miliband insisted he was not trying to score political points. 
	But his words will be interpreted as an attack on the Prime Minister, who has been less passionate about his environmental views in recent years. 
	David Cameron once called on the electorate to ""vote blue, go green"". 
	But he has faced growing scepticism in his own party and recently promised to row back on green levies on energy bills in the face of public anger. 
	Mr Cameron has also faced calls from his own Chancellor, George Osborne, to make sure the green agenda is held behind the economic one, particularly in times of austerity. 
	But it could be that the party is facing a shift of attitudes among the public. 
	The Observer also runs an Opinium poll showing that more than half of voters - 51% - believe the recent floods are a sign of climate change and global warming. That is more than double the 24% who do not, and the 20% who are neutral. 
	It comes as Boris Johnson, the Tory Mayor of London, blames the ""vast and malignant rage of mother nature"" for the floods. 
	In an article in the Sun On Sunday, he contrasts the disaster to another problem he describes as ""entirely avoidable"" - the recent Tube strike in London. 
	""There are natural disasters, and man-made disasters,"" he concludes.

2014-02-16,Wave Death Cruise Ship Was 'Badly Maintained',https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140216183329/http://news.sky.com/story/1212363/wave-death-cruise-ship-was-badly-maintained,"The widow of a man who died when a freak wave crashed into a cruise ship has claimed the vessel was ""improperly maintained"". 
	Helen Swinstead said she told her husband James the windows of the Marco Polo were going to leak before water started pouring in. 
	The extent of the waves whipped up by the severe storm that hit Britain on Friday was revealed in new photos taken from on board the ship as it sailed past France. 
	Nektarios Rigas, who uploaded the pictures to Facebook, described the 20-metre waves as ""mountains"". 
	A number of the Marco Polo's 735 mainly British passengers were injured when one of the waves crashed into the ship in the English Channel. 
	Cruise and Maritime Voyages (CMV), which owns the vessel, said it had undergone ""stringent and rigorous surveys"" and regular inspections. 
	However, Mrs Swinstead, from Colchester, told Sky News: ""I said to my husband - because my father used to make paint - (the window's) going to leak because of the rust. 
	""There was a rusty puddle on the window sill. I think the ship was improperly maintained. 
	""It had come from Madeira, I think, before we got on it in January, and they had bad storms then. And there's so much paint on the outside - you probably can't see the rust. 
	""They'd just slop some more on whenever we got into port."" 
	Christian Verhounig, chief executive of CMV, said the safety of passengers travelling with the company was of ""paramount importance"". 
	""Marco Polo undergoes stringent and rigorous surveys and is inspected regularly including a recent annual dry docking survey and certification,"" he said. 
	""It is a purpose-built deep sea ocean going liner maintained and serviced in full compliance of strict British and international maritime regulations and is efficiently manned by a professional and dedicated crew."" 
	The Marco Polo was travelling through an area of the English Channel known as the Western Approaches when the wave struck. 
	It was on its way to its home port of Tilbury, Essex, at the end of a 42-night voyage which had included the Brazilian Amazon and the West Indies. 
	A female passenger in her 70s was airlifted off the ship, while 14 others were treated for minor injuries. 
	The wave caused damage to the ship's Waldorf Restaurant. 
	Mrs Swinstead described the moment the water burst into the area where she was sat with her husband. 
	""It was quite dreadful,"" she said. ""I was sitting next to him and this window just came in and the sea with it. I was ... well ... we were all very, very wet. 
	""With our insurance I think I'm entitled to £2,000, which won't even cover getting him home to Colchester. 
	""I think the shipping company should give some sort of compensation."" 
	She added: ""He was a lovely husband. The crew have been fantastic. The captain was much admired."" 
	Others disembarking the 22,000-tonne ship described the scenes on board. 
	Linda Kogan said: ""It was horrendous, I've never been in storms like it. The waves were coming up almost over the ship. 
	""The ship was at an angle. Some people reported the drawers were falling apart and the wardrobe doors falling off. 
	""A lady was actually thrown out of bed with the force. We weren't in the restaurant when the windows broke but I think it was really scary.""

	Colleagues and emergency crews tried in vain to save Clifford Cox, who was declared dead in the kitchen area of the station in Town Lane around 6pm on Saturday. 
	Mr Cox, who was known as Biff, was based at the station on Green Watch and had served in Surrey for almost 25 years. 
	The 53-year-old's family have been informed and there are not thought to be any suspicious circumstances surrounding his death. 
	Chief fire officer Russell Pearson said: ""We are deeply saddened and upset by this tragic news and our thoughts are with his family, friends and close colleagues at this very difficult time."" 
	Assistant chief fire officer Simon Moore said: ""We can confirm a firefighter has died at the station but he was not on a call at the time. The circumstances of his death have not been established. 
	""We are saddened and upset by this tragic news and our thoughts are with his family and colleagues at this very difficult time."" 
	Sky's Claire Fallon said a Fire Brigades Union official had told her the death is not linked to the recent flooding in Staines, one of the areas worst-hit by heavy rain. 
	Crews from Staines and Sunbury who are currently involved in battling against the flooding will be given support following Mr Cox's death, Mr Pearson said. 
	Residents have been evacuated after homes were flooded by water from swollen rivers and defences have been deployed to try and protect around 150 properties in Staines.

2014-02-16,Bristol Children's Hospital: NHS Boss Orders Probe,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140216183329/http://news.sky.com/story/1212297/bristol-childrens-hospital-nhs-boss-orders-probe,"NHS chief Sir Bruce Keogh has ordered an independent review into Bristol Royal Hospital for Children following the deaths of newborn babies and young children. 
	His announcement came after he held ""a very important"" meeting with families of children who either died or were left seriously ill following treatment at the hospital's paediatric cardiac unit. 
	Some of the families have accused the hospital of a catalogue of neglect and mistreatment of infants with heart problems. 
	Sir Bruce said in a statement: ""My deputy medical director Mike Bewick and I have listened with great care to their concerns about the care their children received. 
	""I would like to thank them for the dignified and powerful way they have talked to us. 
	""We collectively concluded that the most effective course of action might be to put in place an independent review of the care at the Trust's paediatric cardiac unit. 
	""It was clear that, in the interests of everyone, such a review would need to be independent of the NHS. It must be led by the families involved. It must be their review."" 
	Sir Bruce said Sir Ian Kennedy, a lawyer who specialises in the law and ethics of healthcare, has agreed in principle to oversee the review. 
	Last year it emerged around 10 families were believed to be taking legal action against the trust, including seven whose children died after being treated at the hospital. 
	Previously some had called for a public inquiry into what they claimed to be ""chronically low standards"". 
	Among parents that have complained are Steve and Yolanda Turner, whose son Sean Turner died in 2012 from a brain haemorrhage after previously suffering a cardiac arrest - six weeks after he underwent vital corrective heart surgery at the hospital. 
	Last month at an inquest into his death, they gave harrowing accounts of how they begged doctors and nurses to help their desperately ill son. 
	Mr and Mrs Turner, from Warminster, Wiltshire, claim ward hygiene was poor, staff were incompetent and that Sean was neglected to the point where he had an avoidable cardiac arrest. 
	A spokesman for University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust said it welcomed the review and hoped it would ""restore trust and confidence in the service, which has learnt much from the experiences of these families"". 
	The trust's acting chief executive Deborah Lee added: ""For the families who continue to rely on our service, and the staff who work continue committedly to deliver the very best care, it is critical to remind ourselves that this service is delivering good clinical outcomes and, importantly, a positive experience for families - in our most recent survey of parents 98% said they had received excellent, very good or good care. 
	""It saddens me greatly that we have a group of families that believe we have let them down and we will continue to do our utmost to ensure that no other family experiences care in our services in the way that these families did.""

	Mr Barroso said if the country voted for independence in a referendum on September 18 it would have to apply for membership and get its bid approved by all current member states. 
	The Scottish government has said the country would try to gain membership within 18 months of a yes vote. 
	But Mr Barroso suggested this could run into difficulties. ""We have seen Spain has been opposing even the recognition of Kosovo, for instance,"" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. 
	""So it is to some extent a similar case because it's a new country and so I believe it's going to be extremely difficult, if not impossible, a new member state coming out of our countries getting the agreement of the others."" 
	Scotland's Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon labelled the comments ""preposterous"" and said the comparison with Kosovo was ""ridiculous"". 
	""Scotland is already in the EU and has been for 40 years,"" she said. 
	""As Mr Barroso rightly says, the question of Scotland's independent membership of the EU is a matter for the democratic wishes of the people of Scotland and the views of other member states - not the European Commission. 
	""The fact of the matter is that no member state has said it would veto Scotland's continuing membership."" 
	Mr Barroso's comments came after First Minister Alex Salmond described Chancellor George Osborne's intervention into the independence debate as ""ill-thought-out and misinformed"". 
	Earlier this week, Mr Osborne said Scotland would not be able to keep the pound if it voted for independence. 
	Mr Salmond has said he intends to ""deconstruct"" this when he speaks to business leaders in Aberdeen on Monday. 
	""The reality is the pound is as much Scotland's as the rest of the UK,"" he said. 
	""By suggesting otherwise, the Westminster establishment - Tories, Labour and Lib Dems - are reaping a backlash from the ordinary people of Scotland, who feel this is an attempt to bully Scotland ahead of the democratic choice we all look forward to this September.""

	Close behind with 10 nods is the slick 1970s crime caper American Hustle, which is nominated in every acting category, and 12 Years A Slave. 
	Steve McQueen's harrowing story of a New Yorker kidnapped and sold into the slave trade in the 1840s is up for best film, best director and leading actor. 
	""It's fantastic,"" McQueen told Sky News. 
	""I think any time you do something and you get a pat on the back, you always feel good about it and we're very, very grateful. 
	""I'm also just grateful that people are recognised in the crew and the cast - it's one of those things where I can't feel unhappy about it and not proud."" 
	Gravity, which was shot in the UK, is recognised in both the best film and outstanding British film categories, with nods too for Alfonso Cueron in the best director category and Sandra Bullock in the leading actress line-up. 
	Philomena is the only other film to be nominated in both the best film and outstanding British film categories - Steve Coogan who co-produced, co-wrote and co-starred in the movie would collect both awards if the film wins. 
	The film's lead, Dame Judi Dench, is nominated for leading actress. She is up against Amy Adams (American Hustle), Cate Blanchett (Blue Jasmine) and Emma Thompson (Saving Mr Banks), as well as Sandra Bullock. 
	It is Dame Judi's 25th TV and film Bafta nomination. 
	Pippa Harris, deputy chair of the Bafta Film Committee, said: ""Apart from the Oscars, the Baftas is the big awards ceremony that people want to be at, and that actors and directors want to win. 
	""I think we have a duty both to look outwards and be an international awards ceremony but also to focus on British talent and make sure that British films are in the spotlight. 
	""It's great that this year we've managed to do both. 
	""What's terrific is the British impact across the board. So even in films like Captain Philips, which is an American movie, or 12 Years A Slave - both those films are helmed by British directors which I think shows the depth of the talent in this country at the moment."" 
	Captain Phillips has nine nominations in total, with Tom Hanks named in the leading actor category. 
	He is up against British actors Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years A Slave) and Christian Bale (American Hustle), as well as Leonardo DiCaprio (The Wolf Of Wall Street) and Bruce Dern (Nebraska). 
	The Bafta fellowship award for lifetime achievement will be collected by four-time Bafta winner Dame Helen Mirren, who is perhaps most famous for playing Elizabeth II in The Queen. It is the highest accolade bestowed by the Academy. 
	She told Sky News: ""In my world we feel a bit uncomfortable with the whole 'who is best?' element, but this is something quite different thing. 
	""This is about being given respect and honour for a lifetime of work and that's fantastic. 
	""I'll feel amazing - I'll try not to cry because that would be terrible (and) really embarrassing. But it is a huge honour."" 
	The Bafta winners will be announced at a glitzy, star-studded ceremony at the Royal Opera House in London's Covent Garden. 
	The evening will begin with a live performance by Tinie Tempah and Laura Mvula.

	UK Sport has set a minimum target of three medals. 
	If that doesn’t sound much, bear in mind this not very winter sports-mad nation last managed three medals when the Games were opened by Adolf Hitler: Garmisch-Partenkirchen, 1936. 
	A decade or so ago, I stood at the top of a bobsleigh training run in the German Alpine foothills with a senior British Olympic official and asked when the athletes we were watching would get financial backing to match that of their summer counterparts. 
	Amid much well-meaning bluster, his answer was that realistically it would never happen. 
	Now it has. 
	National Lottery and Government  funding for Winter Sports has more than doubled for the four years leading up to Sochi, compared with the period before the Vancouver Games in 2010. 
	Team GB returned from Canada with a single medal, the gold won by Amy Williams in the skeleton. 
	Now Yarnold - who rents a home from Williams in Bath - has repeated that success, adding to the bronze secured by slopestyle snowboarder Jenny Jones on the opening weekend. 
	Among other serious medal chances are the men’s bobsleigh teams, male and female curlers and speed skater Elise Christie, whose fourth-place finish in the 500 metres bodes well for her specialist event, the 1000m. 
	With confidence, belief and momentum being so important in modern elite sport, all those competitors will be boosted enormously by Yarnold’s success. 
	A heptathlete when she went to a Girls4Gold skeleton talent ID day in 2008, the Kent-born 25 year-old needed funding help from a work colleague, Mervyn Sugden. 
	She has now ridden to her place in the record books on a sled nicknamed ""Mervyn"". 
	Careering headfirst downhill at up to 80mph, her chin inches off the ice, the Archers listener and Downton Abbey fan, rewarded not only her ""Yarnie Army"" fan club for their dedicated support, but also Lottery entrants for their money. 
	UK Sport has distributed about £3.5m to skeleton since 2010, and Yarnold is the star product.

	A Coalition pledge to voters will not be fulfilled. 
	So who is to blame? 
	This policy was in the hands of the Lib Dems - so it was up to Nick Clegg to draw up proposals to be included in this year’s Queen’s Speech. 
	But - of course - the Deputy Prime Minister needs sign off from his Conservative partners. 
	And that is what party insiders say he is struggling to get. 
	They admit that the bill is as good as dead, but they say David Cameron and his cronies are to blame. 
	Lib Dem sources accuse the Tories of first watering down their efforts before killing them off. 
	Why? ""They are not exactly enthusiastic about political reform, are they?"" says one source. 
	""Voting reform; Lords reform; party funding reform; and now this. They said no, we said yes."" 
	The suggestion is that Mr Cameron is unwilling to take on backbenchers who don’t want constituents to have the power to oust them. 
	Some blame Lynton Crosby, the chief Tory strategist, who has advised the party to ""get the barnacles off the boat"" by focusing on the core message. 
	Yet others turn the finger of blame back onto Mr Clegg - insisting it was up to him to get this through. 
	The reforming Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith says the ""disgraceful"" Lib Dems drew up a weak bill that was destined to fail. 
	He argues that the plans are not genuine recall, because they only come into play if there is a prison sentence or a ruling of ""serious wrongdoing"" by a Parliamentary committee. 
	That is not power to the people, he insists. 
	True ""recall"" would mean constituents could force a by-election themselves if enough of them (say 20%) voted for it because of an MP’s behaviour. 
	But he isn’t just angry with Mr Clegg. 
	He thinks this episode is shameful for his own party. 
	If the reports are correct, as sources suggest, then Mr Cameron is about to renege on a significant promise to the electorate, according to Mr Goldsmith. 
	Such broken pledges make voters think their main parties are unauthentic, adds the MP, and that leads them to look elsewhere. 
	A timely warning, perhaps, on the day that the Conservatives were beaten into third place by UKIP.

2014-02-16,Shop Around Before Buying An Annuity,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140216183329/http://news.sky.com/story/1211938/shop-around-before-buying-an-annuity,"It is one of the biggest decisions of our lives. 
	Buying an annuity, the regular income you trade in your pension pot for when you retire, comes late in life but nonetheless remains one of life's financial milestones. 
	So what should we make of today's initial report by the Financial Conduct Authority on the market for annuity products? 
	The key findings are quite straightforward: 
	The lesson for consumers from this rather obvious report is this: we should all shop around more before buying an annuity. 
	We mustn't assume the deal offered to you by your pension provider is as good as it gets. 
	And in the meantime, the FCA, which was created in the wake of the financial crisis to look after the interests of consumers, will launch a major inquiry into the business of annuities sales. 
	Well that'll take at least a year. In the meantime, more than 400,000 more people will have purchased an annuity, and potentially locked themselves into poor deals. 
	Then the FCA could spend a similar about of time ""consulting with the industry"" on their recommendations as often happens with these types of changes. 
	It could be years and years before customers see any real change for the better. 
	I can't help but think that after 2013, a year that saw the PPI miss-selling scandal explode, the rigging of Libor which affects rates on consumer savings and borrowing products exposed, and bank account switching revealed as a lengthy and off-putting, the FCA might have found a way to make that change happen faster. 
	While we wait, those looking at purchasing an annuity must take the time to ask around for the best deals, ask about extra benefits they may be entitled to and make sure the deal they go for suits them and their family. 
	By the time the regulator sorts things out, many consumers will be well along the path to better pension provision themselves.

	They have the weaponry, explosives and capability, thanks largely to the defection of an IRA quartermaster. 
	For some time now, crude explosive devices have been their weapon of choice, some planted, some posted. 
	Last autumn, PSNI Chief Matt Baggott and Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers MP were sent letter bombs. 
	Such devices wouldn't cause widespread damage but they are capable of causing death or injury. 
	Speaking exclusively to Sky News in December, PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Drew Harris, said: ""Undoubtedly some of the devices show a degree of sophistication. 
	""I'd point towards the recent vehicle-borne bomb in the centre of Belfast, but also the attempt to murder a retired police officer. Now, those were sophisticated devices. 
	""Other devices are rudimentary in their construction, but equally as dangerous and life-threatening."" 
	There are two so-called dissident groups - The New IRA and Óglaigh na hÉireann or Soldiers of Ireland. 
	The New IRA is an amalgamation of the Real IRA, which bombed Omagh in 1998, and the Continuity IRA. 
	Óglaigh na hÉireann is a more militant faction, many too young to have experienced The Troubles. 
	They reject the label ""dissident"" or ""renegade"" and describe themselves as the ""true Irish Republicans"". 
	Members accuse Sinn Fein of dissenting from ""the cause"" and settling for less than a united Ireland. 
	Fifteen years after The Good Friday Agreement, the bomb squad is still dealing with an incident a day in Northern Ireland. 
	Dissident Republicans seem determined to not only continue their campaign here but export it too.

2014-02-16,Sir Tom Finney: Football Legend Dies Aged 91,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140216183329/http://news.sky.com/story/1211916/sir-tom-finney-football-legend-dies-aged-91,"Former England and Preston footballer Sir Tom Finney has died at the age of 91. 
	The club announced the ""extremely sad news"" of his death on its website. 
	It said: ""Sir Tom was the greatest player to ever play for Preston North End and one of the all-time greats for England. 
	""The thoughts of everyone at the club, and those connected with it, are with his family at this time."" 
	Sir Tom was born at his parents' home in the street next to the club's Deepdale stadium and went on to win 76 caps for England. 
	Nicknamed the ""Preston Plumber"" after completing an apprenticeship with his family's plumbing business, the forward was famous for his loyalty to the Lancashire football side. 
	He made 433 appearances for the club between 1946 and 1960 and maintained links to the club in later life, becoming president. 
	He was knighted in the 1998 Queen's New Year Honours list and a statue outside the stadium's National Football Museum depicts a famous image of him splashing through a puddle during a game at Chelsea in 1956. 
	The Deepdale stadium is currently located on Sir Tom Finney Way and the ground's old West Stand was renamed the Sir Tom Finney stand in 1995, with his image on its seats. 
	Former team-mate Bill Shankly, who himself made 297 appearances with Preston, once said that if pressed, he would say Sir Tom was ""the best player ever born"". 
	Ex-England footballer Sir Stanley Matthews had said of Sir Tom: ""To dictate the pace and course of a game, a player has to be blessed with awesome qualities. 
	""Those who have accomplished it on a regular basis can be counted on the fingers of one hand - Pele, Maradona, Best, Di Stefano, and Tom Finney."" 
	And another England legend Sir Bobby Charlton said: ""Sir Tom Finney was one of the greatest footballers there has ever been - he was the type of player that people would travel a long way to see."" 
	Match of the Day pundit and former England striker Gary Lineker tweeted: ""Sir Tom Finney has left us. One of the greatest players this country has ever seen, and a true gentleman. #RIP""

	It is the second successive triumph for a Briton in the competition after Amy Williams' achievement in Vancouver in 2010. 
	And it means Team GB has won skeleton medals at every Games since the event was introduced to the Olympic programme in 2002 in Salt Lake City. 
	Yarnold, from Kent, had a lead of almost half a second over her nearest rival following the first two runs on Thursday and this made her favourite going into day two in Russia. 
	The 25-year-old athlete smashed the track record in her third run to move over three quarters of a second clear of American Noelle Pikus-Pace. 
	Yarnold clocked 58.09 seconds on her fourth and final run to win by 0.97secs from Pikus-Pace with a combined time of three minutes 52.89secs. 
	She celebrated after her gold-clinching final run by running towards the British fans in the crowd holding up the Union Jack and beaming with joy. 
	In a TV interview, she also thanked supporters back home and said she ""could not have done it without you all"". 
	She added people should follow their dreams, never give up and never limit themselves to what they can achieve.  
	Yarnold has dominated the World Cup season, winning the overall title with four victories and three more podium finishes from the season's eight races. 
	Yarnold, who rides on a sled nicknamed Mervyn after one of her supporters, can reach speeds of around 80mph. 
	Her parents Clive and Judith, her two sisters Katie and Charlotte, and her boyfriend James Roche, who is a sled technician with the British bobsleigh team, were present to witness her triumph. 
	Compatriot Shelley Rudman, who scooped silver in 2006, finished in 16th place this time with a combined time of 3:56.47. 
	Britain's Alex Coomber picked up a bronze at the Olympics in 2002. 
	Yarnold was a promising heptathlete as a teenager. 
	Aged 19, she took part in the 'Girls4Gold' talent identification programme in the hope she would be diverted into Great Britain's modern pentathlon programme. 
	Instead, she was sent to skeleton, whose programme had increased since Rudman won the silver medal at the Turin Olympics two years previously. 
	Yarnold immediately took to her new sport, and within four years of getting on a sled for the first time, she was crowned junior world champion in Innsbruck in 2012. 
	Her Olympic victory is 30 years to the day since ice skaters Torvill and Dean scooped gold for Britain in Sarajevo.

	Investigators examining the cause of the November crash, which left 10 people dead, said preliminary inquiries found that both the left and right engine of the helicopter failed. 
	In the final stages of the flight the right engine ""flamed out and shortly after the left engine flamed out,"" the report from the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said. 
	Shortly afterwards ""the helicopter descended and struck the roof of the Clutha Vaults bar at a high rate of descent, in an upright attitude."" 
	The report, the second to be released on the accident so far, said 76kg (168lb) of fuel was found to have been left in the main fuel tank, leaving the cause of the engine failure unclear. 
	Further investigation into the crash ""will seek to determine why a situation arose that led to both the helicopter's engines flaming out when 76kg remained in the fuel tank group,"" AAIB said. 
	Other unexplained factors, including ""why no emergency radio transmission was received from the pilot, and why, following the double engine failure, an autorotative descent and flare recovery was not achieved"" are also to be examined. 
	Police Constables Kirsty Nelis and Tony Collins and civilian pilot David Traill were killed when the  Eurocopter EC135 helicopter crashed into the roof of the Clutha bar at around 10.30pm on November 29. 
	Seven people inside the bar were also killed. They were named as Robert Jenkins, Mark O'Prey, Colin Gibson, John McGarrigle, Gary Arthur, Samuel McGhee and Joe Cusker.

2014-02-16,Crawley Suicide Bomb Suspect In YouTube Film,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140216183329/http://news.sky.com/story/1211815/crawley-suicide-bomb-suspect-in-youtube-film,"Video footage and pictures have emerged of a man suspected of being Britain's first suicide bomber in Syria. 
	In the YouTube film Abdul Waheed Majeed, 41, is shown dressed in white and appearing relaxed as he poses for pictures with fighters next to a lorry he allegedly drove into a jail in Aleppo and detonated a bomb last week. 
	In the first video of the married father of three appears not to understand when spoken to in Arabic. 
	He is heard to say in English: ""I'm not a very good speaker...my tongue has got a knot in it"", and added ""...it should come from the heart and I can't do it"". 
	The footage later shows the truck being driven towards the prison to the sound of small arms fire, and then a huge explosion, and a massive plume of smoke stretching into the sky. 
	It is thought to be the first time a Briton has staged a suicide attack in the war-torn state, where rising numbers of UK-born extremists have gone to fight. 
	Photographs have also been published of Majeed looking relaxed and smiling with local children, at a refugee camp on the Turkey/Syria border. 
	In one picture, he is seen wearing pink Minnie Mouse-style ears while he cuddles a child. 
	In another, he is pictured kneeling surrounded by children as they give the peace sign. 
	Counter-terrorism officers have been searching Majeed's home in Martyrs Avenue in Langley Green, Crawley, West Sussex - the ex-home of schoolgirl Sarah Payne's killer Roy Whiting, according to neighbours. 
	Majeed, known as Waheed, left Britain six months ago, telling his family he was going on a humanitarian mission to Syria. 
	Arif Syed, 59, a community leader in Crawley, where Majeed was born, said Majeed would phone or Skype his family every few days, but communication was lost with him more than a week ago. 
	When news emerged about the suicide bombing in Syria, the family of Majeed - who is of Pakistani origin - started to panic, he added. 
	Majeed's uncle, Mohammad Jamil, 65, said Majeed - who is a father of two boys and a girl aged 18, 16 and 12 - had never shown any sign of extremism. 
	However, extremist preacher Omar Bakri Mohammed told the London Evening Standard that Majeed was ""a very dear brother"". 
	He claimed Majeed had been an active student and valued member of the banned extremist al Muhajiroun organisation between 1996 and 2004 and had wanted to further the ""Muslim cause"". 
	Speaking at Broadfield Mosque in Crawley, Mr Syed said Majeed's family and the local community had no knowledge of his apparent links with Bakri. 
	Mr Syed said: ""What Bakri is saying from Libya is all heresy. We have absolutely no knowledge whatsoever."" 
	He added that the family had had no confirmation that Majeed was behind the attack. 
	Mr Syed accused the authorities of a ""witch-hunt"" by raiding properties when the local Muslim community had offered full co-operation. 
	Mr Jamil said the family would ""be shocked"" if official confirmation emerged that Majeed was the suicide bomber. 
	""As far as the family are concerned, he went for humanitarian reasons,"" he said. 
	""The family had no suspicions at all that he was in line to do something like this."" 
	Sussex Police have said that their investigations were continuing as tensions in the Crawley Muslim community are said to be running high over the issue. 
	Chief Inspector Justina Beeken said: ""There has been no formal identification of the man and therefore we cannot confirm who he is or where he is from. 
	""There has been a lot of media and social media coverage around Syria and we are working with the local community to reassure and engage with them regarding this. We are a community which always pulls together and supports each other.""

	The deactivation comes after thousands of usernames and passwords - taken from non-Tesco websites - appeared on a text-sharing portal. 
	It is believed that cyber thieves then used that data to crack accounts at Tesco.com, relying on the habit of some people using the same usernames and passwords for various websites. 
	A Tesco spokesperson told Sky News: ""We take the security of our customers' data extremely seriously and are urgently investigating these claims. 
	""We are contacting all customers who may have been affected and are committed to ensuring that none of them miss out as a result of this."" 
	The speculative attack on Tesco was also used to steal Clubcard points from some customers - believed to number fewer than 10. 
	The company, Britain's biggest supermarket group, said it would reimburse those hit in the breach. 
	The spokesperson added: ""We will issue replacement vouchers to the very small number who are affected."" 
	In early 2013 a number of Clubcard holders had their vouchers stolen by cyber criminals after Tesco spotted ""irregular activity"". 
	Log-in credentials of customers were allegedly harvested by hackers using phishing emails.

	Former Manchester councillor Mike Kane held the seat for the party, polling 13,261 votes or 55.34% of the vote. 
	UKIP's John Bickley saw his party surge from fifth place in 2010 to second, despite leader Nigel Farage complaining the campaign had been ""as dirty as they come"". 
	The party's success and the drop in the Conservative vote is yet another by-election blow to David Cameron. 
	But the Liberal Democrats were also dealt a humiliating blow when they polled just 1,176 votes - not enough to hold their deposit. 
	In his victory speech, Mr Kane said voters had ""sent a very clear message"" to the Government. 
	He said: ""They have rejected the failed policies of the out-of-touch Tories, they have rejected the isolationism and scaremongering of UKIP. 
	""It's a result which emphatically demonstrates that people here know the NHS is not safe in David Cameron's hands, and that we've had enough of his utterly out-of-touch government."" 
	Mr Bickley, whose party's share of the vote rocketed by 11%, said he was ""over the moon"" with the result. 
	He told Sky News: ""We've taken votes off all of them and that includes Labour."" 
	The Prime Minister sought to play down the significance of his party's slump to third place. 
	Mr Cameron said: ""It was never in doubt, this was always going to be a Labour win and I'll congratulate the candidate when he comes to the House of Commons. 
	""But by-elections are times when people know they can send a message and make a protest without changing the Government and those messages, those protests, I always listen to them very carefully and I will do on this occasion too."" 
	Speaking in Wythenshawe, Labour leader Ed Miliband said: ""What this by-election shows is that there is only one party in British politics that can stand up for the whole of the country. 
	""We saw a Labour party expanding, growing its support and a Tory party and a Liberal Democrat party shrinking its base and shrivelling its support."" 
	UKIP leader Nigel Farage told Sky News the result showed the party was having a real influence on the political agenda ahead of European elections in May. 
	He said: ""We have shifted the centre of gravity on the debate on Europe, on immigration, on many other issues and UKIP is the first party ever not actually represented in the House of Commons, that is actually dictating policy in many areas."" 
	He said the prospect of an electoral pact with the Conservatives ahead of the next general election was ""just about zero"". 
	Wythenshawe and Sale East is the latest in a number of by-elections that have seen UKIP take second place, including South Shields and Eastleigh last year. 
	The by-election was brought about by the sudden death of the serving MP, Paul Goggins, on January 7 at the age of 60.

2014-02-16,FCA To Probe Annuities Market For Pensions,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140216183329/http://news.sky.com/story/1211534/fca-to-probe-annuities-market-for-pensions,"The Financial Conduct Authority is to investigate pension providers over claims that the annuity market is preventing pensioners from getting a fair deal in retirement. 
	The FCA launched a probe into annuities last year and said it revealed such a ""disorderly market"" that it will carry out a competition market study looking at sales of annuities by pension providers to their existing customers. 
	The regulator will look for signs that companies try to hang on to customers by putting them off shopping around for a better deal. 
	If it finds examples of bad practice, it will ask firms to make immediate changes. 
	The FCA looked at around four-fifths of the 420,000 annuity sales that took place in 2012. 
	It found that 60% of people stayed with their current pension provider, but four out of five -fifths of them would have benefited from shopping around and switching. 
	Those buying a standard annuity could have boosted their annual income by as much as £200 by shopping around and by £67 on average, the data showed. 
	Buyers of enhanced annuities could have been £290 better off or increased their annual income by £135, the FCA found. 
	The trade body for the industry also admits change is now needed. 
	The Association of British Insurers said: ""We agree with the FCA that there is an issue about people with smaller pots of savings not having access to as many options as those with large pots. 
	""We fully support efforts to help people make the most of their savings so they have more chance of securing a decent retirement income."" 
	Annuities are a one-off purchase that people make when they retire, which convert their pension savings pot into a fixed annual income for the rest of their lives. 
	A variety of annuity types exist, including standard ones that most people tend to get and enhanced annuities, where people in ill health, such as smokers, can get higher payments. 
	The FCA's report is due to be published in the next 12 months but campaigners are calling for action to be taken now. 
	Independent expert and former Downing Street adviser Ros Altmann said: ""The reason why immediate action is so important is that this market affects so many people and the transactions they are making are irreversible. 
	""More than 1,000 people every week are buying annuities and the market is worth £14bn each year."" 
	The FCA said firms generally expect annuities sold to existing pension customers to be more profitable than business on the open market. 
	Martin Wheatley, the FCA's chief executive officer, said: ""For most people getting the right annuity could mean the equivalent of an extra £1,500 in savings - so we need to understand why they aren't shopping around and switching."" 
	Pensions Minister Steve Webb said: ""Automatic enrolment means millions more people will be saving into a pension and therefore buying annuities in the coming years. 
	""This makes taking effective action to ensure that people get value for money from annuities all the more important, and the new FCA review is a welcome and crucial step, as part of the Government's ongoing work on the issue.""

	Thousands of residents in vulnerable areas have been battling to save their properties from damage after record rainfall left them inundated with water. 
	But Neil McDermid, who runs flood-defence specialists Total Flooding Solutions, said those living in regions at a high risk of flooding should take matters into their own hands. 
	""We know these areas well and we know it's an accident waiting to happen,"" he told Sky News. 
	""Everyone is kicking the police and the Environment Agency, but it's the elements. If a big wind comes and blows your roof away, you don't go blaming the Government for that, and this is no different. 
	""The Environment Agency can build high walls around all these areas, but the water has to go somewhere. 
	""Having your house flooded is generally much worse than having your house burgled, so its up to people, where possible, to defend their properties."" 
	Mr McDermid urged anyone concerned that they may be vulnerable flooding to have a proper flood-risk assessment carried out. 
	""There are some common sense things you can do, like getting everything off the floor and high up and rolling up carpets where possible,"" he said. 
	""The main thing I would say, is that sandbags have a success rate of about 1%. They may make people feel like they are actually doing something, but they are very limited in their effectiveness. 
	""A far better method is to simply buy pieces of plywood to surround your home and put silicone around them. That will do a much better job of keeping the water out initially."" 
	He said a key factor in his advice was ""damage limitation"". 
	""Once you have protected your home as best you can, a pump can be invaluable if and when the water does get in,"" he said. 
	""We use pumps that will pump out 500 litres a minute, but people can buy smaller ones which can do up to 200 litres a minute. 
	""Non-return valves can also be crucial, because when your house is contaminated by sewage, you lose everything. 
	""You can have one installed for around £2,000, which is money well spent if it prevents contamination."" 
	He said his firm was responsible for defending hundreds of electricity sub-stations around the country from flooding and that he did not expect flood-related problems to improve in the near future. 
	""We read the big climate change report that came out in 2009 so we knew this was coming,"" he said. 
	""It may seem like a freak event, but unfortunately this kind of flooding is here to stay.""
