	The 28-year-old and her guide Charlotte Evans were the first skiers out on the Rosa Khutor course in Sochi and clocked one minute 28.72 seconds. 
	She then waited as her rivals failed to beat her time. 
	Jade Etherington won bronze with the help of guide Caroline Powell for her second medal of the competition. 
	Britain has had athletes in every Winter Paralympics since the first event in 1976, but had never won gold. 
	The three medals won so far surpasses the minimum target of two set by UK Sport. 
	""It was nerve-wracking but I'm delighted with the result,"" said Gallagher. 
	""Normally when we compete, even in big events like World Championships, there is nobody interested in what we are doing, but here there has been a lot of hype and pressure, as well as expectation, and maybe we let some of that in, so today we just decided to ski and see what happens. 
	""I have to thank Charlotte for getting me to the line. We just threw ourselves at it. I prayed for the strength to ski and have fun."" 
	Gallagher, from Bangor in County Down, has oculocutaneous albinism, a condition with affects the pigment in her hair, skin and eyes. 
	She started skiing when she was 17 on a trip to Andorra. 
	Gallagher and Evans have been working together since 2010 and have previously won silver and bronze medals in the 2011 and 2013 World Championships. 
	Evans added: ""I was yelling a lot and she wasn't doing what I told her, but finally it paid off. It didn't feel as good as we wanted to on the course, but who cares, we won a gold medal and it feels amazing."" 
	The pair are in action again in Tuesday's Super Combined event. 
	Etherington and Powell will both compete in Friday's slalom.

2014-03-10,Energy Bills To Show Codes To Help Consumers,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140310100828/http://news.sky.com/story/1223222/energy-bills-to-show-codes-to-help-consumers,"By Rhiannon Mills, Sky Correspondent Homeowners are being offered a new way to potentially save money on their energy bills - QR (or Quick response) codes. 
	The Department for Energy and Climate change want all energy companies to add the codes to their bills, to give customers an easier way of finding out how much they have spent on gas and electricity. 
	The codes are small box shapes with unique combinations of black and white dots, and are similar to barcodes, providing easy access to information through your smartphone. 
	In order to read them, customers will need to download a QR reader app on their phones. 
	This is the latest announcement from the Government to help consumers get a better deal, with collective switching and simpler tariffs already introduced. 
	Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Edward Davey said: ""We're determined to make energy markets work better for consumers - and despite all the evidence showing that QR codes on bills would make a real difference to people, energy companies still haven't done anything about it. 
	""That's why we're acting to make sure people have a quick, straightforward way to compare the best deal for them with a simple swipe of their phone. 
	""With so many of us using smart phones and tablets nowadays it would be strange if we weren't using the latest technology to help us save money at home."" 
	The Government says studies have shown that the technology would be helpful for customers, but there has been no voluntary move by the energy sector to introduce QR codes, therefore they are taking action under the Energy Act to modify the energy company licences to have QR codes included as part of energy bills. 
	Energy UK, which represents the industry, told Sky News: ""Energy companies are working hard to streamline tariffs, improve customer information and encourage choice so people have all they need to compare and switch. 
	""And it's working - around quarter of a million customers switch every month and nearly a million did last November and December alone."" 
	Despite concerns from some campaign groups, ministers insist the QR codes will also benefit vulnerable consumers or those who do not use smart phones, because people with smartphones will be able to help friends and family less comfortable with technology.

2014-03-10,Revealed: Oxford Is 'Most Expensive City',https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140310100828/http://news.sky.com/story/1223360/revealed-oxford-is-most-expensive-city,"Oxford is the UK's least affordable city, a study finds, because homes there cost 11 times the average local wage. 
	According to the report, by Lloyds Bank, the average cost of a property in the university city was almost £341,000. 
	Winchester, Truro, Bath and Brighton made up the top five list of ""least affordable"" places to live, while Westminster in central London came in seventh place. 
	Although property prices in Westminster are among the highest in the UK, relatively high earnings in the heart of London stopped Westminster from coming higher on the list. 
	The study suggested that city living had become less affordable over the last year - largely a result of stagnant wage growth and surging house prices. 
	It said the price of a home in a large town or city grew by 5% over the last year to reach £184,215 on average - or 5.8 times someone's average earnings. 
	Stirling in Scotland and Londonderry in Northern Ireland were named as the UK's most affordable cities to live in, with house prices in those areas typically costing 3.3 times and 3.6 times local earnings respectively. 
	Glasgow, Belfast, Lisburn, Bradford, Lancaster and Salford all featured among the most affordable urban areas to live. 
	York was the only northern city to make the line-up of the UK's least affordable cities, at number 20. 
	A home in York costs nearly six times average wages, while one in nearby cities like Hull and Sheffield would set someone back just over four-and-a-half times their earnings. 
	The report pointed to the large numbers of people living in Oxford who commute to London to work as part of the reason why house prices there are particularly out of step with local wages. 
	A year ago, a house in Oxford cost 9.8 times local earnings. 
	The UK housing market has picked up sharply in some areas over the last year amid Government schemes such as Help to Buy, which have unleashed a wave of fresh demand into the property market from people who had previously struggled to get access to a mortgage.

2014-03-10,NHS Set To To Trial Edible Health Sensors,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140310100828/http://news.sky.com/story/1223233/nhs-set-to-to-trial-edible-health-sensors,"By Philippa Hall, Sky News Reporter Edible sensors that can tell your doctor if you have taken your medication are a step closer to being used on the NHS. 
	After a small trial in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, it has been announced that one of the biggest NHS acute teaching trusts has signed up to test a digital sensor the size of a poppy seed. 
	The sensor is made of copper and magnesium, which are digestable, and a small bit of silicon. 
	When swallowed with prescription medicine, the metals react with the patient's stomach fluid and power the sensor. 
	The sensor then sends a message to a patch on the abdomen, recording the time the medication was taken. 
	The patch also records heart rate and if the user was walking, sitting or lying down when the pill was taken. 
	It uses wireless technology to send the data to a digital device belonging to a doctor, carer or even a family member. 
	Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust has partnered with American company Proteus Digital Health to test the device. 
	Dr Peter Godbehere has used this technology in East Anglia as part of a trial for hypertension. 
	He said: ""We've never been able to show, for sure, how regularly patients have been taking medication and this is a big thing for us. 
	""People quote figures of around 40% or more of treatments that aren't taken to how we prescribe them. 
	""If we had these sensors in all the regular medication, I know it seems a bit big brother, but we can be sure that people are taking products in the best way."" 
	Two other organisations - The Northern Health Science Alliance (NHSA) and Eastern Adacemic Health Science Network (EAHSN) - have also signed up for the trial. 
	The technology is in the early stages of use in the UK but it is hoped it could save NHS England money through better-targeted treatment. 
	Dr. Godbehere said he sees most potential with illnesses like Alzheimers and heart disease where people take pills everyday. 
	Any patterns spotted could be used in the emerging field of predictive medicine. 
	However the head of healthcare at the Technology Strategy Board - an arm's length public body that aims to support business innovation - warns cost won't be the only consideration ahead of a potential roll-out across all of NHS England. 
	Zahid Latif said: ""People get very hung-up about data. If data's being generated about their healthcare, that is different to data being pushed out from their Fitbit or their Nike Fuelband. 
	""We've seen the debates recently about care.data and people are sensitive about how that data is being shared and used."" 
	The controversial care.data database has been delayed by six months primarily because the public wasn't informed properly about the roll-out.  
	There has also been criticism it could lead to privacy problems and data breaches but NHS England say they are working on informing people about what safeguards are in place.

2014-03-10,Dementia: Alzheimer's Blood Test Offers Hope,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140310100828/http://news.sky.com/story/1223211/dementia-alzheimers-blood-test-offers-hope,"A new test which could detect if a person will develop dementia within three years has been called a ""major step forward"". 
	US scientists have said the discovery of changes in the blood may signify the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease - a condition which affects 35 million people worldwide. 
	For the first time, they have shown differences in blood biomarkers between those with Alzheimer's before symptoms occur and those who will not develop it. 
	And the scientists claim the test using 10 identified molecules has a 90% accuracy rate. 
	The research may help treatment strategies at an earlier stage - when therapy would be more effective at slowing or preventing onset of symptoms. 
	Researchers from Georgetown University Medical Centre examined 525 participants aged 70 and over and monitored them for five years. 
	Halfway through the study, the authors analysed blood samples from 53 patients who already had one of the conditions and compared them with those from 53 ""cognitively normal"" people. 
	They found the biomarkers could predict with 90% accuracy whether participants went on to develop mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's. 
	One of the study's authors, Professor Howard Federoff, said: ""We consider our results a major step toward the commercialisation of a preclinical disease biomarker test that could be useful for large-scale screening to identify at-risk individuals."" 
	At the moment, the test is only going to be used for research. 
	Dr Simon Ridley from the charity Alzheimer's Research UK said: ""Alzheimer's disease begins to develop long before symptoms such as memory loss appear. 
	""But detecting the disease at this pre-symptomatic stage has so far proved difficult. 
	""More work is needed to confirm these findings, but a blood test to identify people at risk of Alzheimer's would be a real step forward for research.""

	The business lobby group believes the UK will grow by 2.8% this year and that the second quarter will see gross domestic product rise to the level seen in the first quarter of 2008. 
	A year ago, the BCC predicted the pre-recession peak would not be reached until 2016. 
	The group's director general, John Longworth, said Britain's economic recovery is gaining momentum. 
	""Businesses across the UK are expanding and creating jobs, and our increasingly sunny predictions for growth are a testament to their drive and ambition,"" he said. 
	The BCC expects the first increase in interest rates will happen in the autumn next year - one quarter earlier than previously envisaged, before rising to 1.5% in the second half of 2016. GDP will be 2.5% next year and in 2016. 
	But Mr Longworth warned business investment is likely to remain below pre-crisis levels for some time to come. 
	""Major issues remain, such as the unacceptably high level of youth unemployment,"" he added. 
	""We urge the Chancellor to use this month's Budget wisely by incentivising businesses to hire young people so that the next generation of workers are not left behind. 
	""We just hope that as the general election gets closer, politicians are not tempted to abandon a drive for long-term economic security in favour of short-term vote winners. 
	""No government over the next decade can afford to get distracted - and our leaders must do everything in their power to ensure the economy goes from being merely good, to being truly great.""

	Andrew Halcrow was west of Cape Horn when the mast on his yacht, the Elsi Arrub, snapped and the propulsion system failed, leaving him stranded about 240 miles (386km) west of Punta Arenas. 
	After the 54-year-old made an emergency call on Sunday, a Chilean naval helicopter flew to his aid and winched him to safety. 
	A statement posted on his website read: ""Andrew just phoned from Punta Arenas. 
	""He arrived after the re-fuelling stop in Felix to a media circus, TV cameras and journalists which he definitely was not expecting. 
	""He has hit 'the wall' now and needs to shower, eat and sleep. He will meet with a local Admiral tomorrow who will talk about how it might be possible to find Elsi. 
	""He is sounding fine."" 
	Mr Halcrow set off in his 32ft boat in November from Falmouth, Cornwall. 
	It is the second time he has had to abandon his mission to circumnavigate the globe on his own. 
	In 2006, Mr Halcrow had to quit his first solo round-the-world voyage when he began feeling sharp stomach pains and sickness while south west of Australia. 
	He managed to raise the alarm by contacting his girlfriend 10,000 miles away in the Shetland Islands. 
	She then alerted UK coastguards, who contacted their Australian counterparts. A spotter plane found him and he was later picked up by a passing tanker.

	He was taken ill at a house party in Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire, on Saturday, along with a 17-year-old boy. 
	The 16-year-old is said to be in a serious but stable condition. 
	The two teenagers went to Monklands District General Hospital in Airdrie at about 11.30pm. 
	Police Scotland said they believe the drugs taken included ecstasy and ""possibly"" a ""Mortal Kombat"" tablet. 
	The drug is distributed in red tablets with a dragon imprinted upon them. 
	The exact content of the drug is uncertain, but it is thought to be an ecstasy-type compound containing mephedrone and ketamine. 
	Regane MacColl, 17, from Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire, collapsed at The Arches nightclub in central Glasgow last month after taking the drug. She later died in hospital. 
	The latest incident has prompted renewed warnings about the danger of the tablets. 
	Detective Inspector Debbie Johnstone, of Coatbridge CID, said: ""Illicit drugs are dangerous. I would ask that anyone with information about the supply of drugs, in particular, the type described as mortal kombat, contact police on the non emergency number 101 or to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 where details can be given in confidence."" 
	An NHS Lanarkshire spokeswoman said: ""Anyone who has taken ecstasy - particularly the one described as mortal kombat, and who is feeling unwell, or who knows someone who has taken this type of drug in the past few hours, should attend or contact their local hospital for treatment and advice.""

2014-03-10,£140m Pothole Repair Fund After Winter Storms,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140310100828/http://news.sky.com/story/1222921/140m-pothole-repair-fund-after-winter-storms,"By Tadhg Enright, Sky Correspondent An extra £140m is being made available by Westminster to help local councils repair roads which have been battered by this winter's severe weather. 
	Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said: ""Having the right infrastructure in place to support businesses and hardworking people is a crucial part of our long-term economic plan. 
	""This extra money will help make a real difference to the millions of road users and local residents who rely on local roads, giving them safer and smoother journeys."" 
	Some £36.5m of the cash will be ring-fenced for councils which experienced the worst of the flooding and it brings the total amount of emergency government funding for these authorities to £80m. 
	All councils in England can apply for a share of the other £103.5m in additional funding to cover the cost of repairs after the wettest winter on record. 
	Some of the most serious flooding was experienced in the Surrey County Council area where at least £15m - half its annual budget - has already been spent on repairing battered roads since Christmas. 
	Repair teams have been working at weekends to patch roads where a combination of rainwater and groundwater has caused more erosion than an average winter. 
	John Furey, Cabinet Member for Transport, Highways and Environment with Surrey County Council, told Sky News: ""It's double the problem for this year. The reason is that it's been a continuous flooding situation, not something that happened and then we could deal with it.  
	""The biggest problem has been the inspection times. We haven't been able to get in and look and see how much has needed to be done.  
	""Now we're doing it. We've started the recovery stage. Now we're looking at what needs to be done and looking at what government is going to put into this."" 
	Surrey County Council will have to apply for extra financial help from the Government and its allocation will depend on the length of affected roads in its jurisdiction. 
	It does not expect its allocation to cover all the money spent on repairs and other budgets will have to be trimmed. 
	The Government intends to release the money by the end of this coming week and it hopes that councils will have completed repairs in time for the summer holidays. 
	Delays will cost motorists money too, as experienced by the increase in those seeking repairs to their cars at Reigate Motor Company. 
	The garage's director Simon Youthed told Sky News that business was particularly brisk and that potholes were to blame. 
	""We always see damaged cars at this time of year, but certainly the floods have had their effect on the roads, certainly in this area,"" he said. 
	""It's predominantly cars going through potholes, usually at speed, that often the drivers don't see.  
	""One of the road wheels tends to go down into the pothole with force ... (and) that can either damage the wheel itself, it can damage the tyre, it can damage the suspension springs.""

	Chief executive Euan Sutherland is set to receive a salary of more than £3.6m, it has been claimed. 
	He said last month the mutual had ""lost touch"" with customers and launched an online poll so people could make suggestions about its future direction. 
	It comes amid plans to sell parts of its business that have left question marks over thousands of jobs. 
	The Co-op runs supermarkets, pharmacies and funeral services. It is owned by its eight million members. 
	The Observer has seen documents that say the pay packages are necessary because ""the (Co-op's) executive agenda is possibly the most complex one facing a large business in the country today"", a reference to the recent troubles at the bank. 
	Mr Sutherland will be given a base salary of £1.5m this year, with a £1.5m retention payment, the paper claims. 
	It says that when pension contributions and extras are included, this rises to £3.66m. 
	Mr Sutherland's predecessor, Peter Marks, received around £1.3m last year. 
	Chief operating officer Richard Pennycook will receive a salary of £900,000 and a retention payment of the same amount. 
	Six other executives will be paid salaries of between £500,000 and £650,000, with the same amount in retention. 
	Ursula Lidbetter, chair of the Co-operative Group, said: ""The remuneration packages of our executives are in the middle of a range of comparable companies. 
	""This represents an increase on the pay of their predecessors to reflect the greater commercial, management and turnaround experience they are bringing to bear.

	The material is being assessed by police and army bomb disposal experts, who were seen coming and going at a bungalow in the cul-de-sac. 
	Speaking at the scene, Superintendent Liz Watson said officers acted on information that a local man had been buying items which could be explosive if put together. 
	She said: ""The police had received some information regarding a gentleman that lives in the local area that's been purchasing hazardous material."" 
	Police said the 55-year-old who was arrested remains in custody in Doncaster.

	Efforts to change the law are being spearheaded by Tory MP Andrew Bridgen. 
	He said that for some cash-strapped families, the current law was ""criminalising them for being poor"". 
	""It is outrageous that so many people are brought into the criminal justice system through this means. I believe that non-payment should be treated in the way that parking tickets are,"" Mr Bridgen told the newspaper. 
	""It is absurd that the courts are being clogged up by such a minor offence.""

	Clare's Law, which enables people to check the police records of partners, has been launched across England and Wales after being piloted by four police forces. 
	The father of murder victim Clare Wood, whose name has been given to the scheme, has welcomed its introduction, describing it as ""a bittersweet moment"". 
	Michael Brown discovered five years ago that his daughter had been raped and strangled at her Salford home by ex-boyfriend George Appleton, who set fire to her body before going on the run. He was found hanged several days later. 
	Appleton, who Clare met on Facebook, had a history of violence against women, including knife-point kidnapping. 
	Mr Brown told Sky News: ""When you lose a family member in these circumstances it is always with you. To realise that the last moments of your daughter's life were kicking and screaming in a room in Salford sticks with you.""

	""This is just another piece of armour plate for people to put on when they are in trouble."" 
	The launch coincides with International Women's Day and also marks the introduction of Domestic Violence Protection Orders (DVPOs), which are designed to provide support for victims in the immediate aftermath of violent incidents. 
	DVPOs can last for up to 28 days, during which time a perpetrator can be prevented from having contact with the victim. 
	Speaking about Clare's Law, Home Secretary Theresa May said: ""What we saw from the pilots was a real benefit for women who were able to go to the police where they had suspicions about the behaviour of their partner. 
	""As a result of that, they were able to make a decision about whether to stay with that partner or to leave.""

	She took silver in the women's downhill, clocking a time of one minute 34.28 seconds with the aide of her guide Caroline Powell. 
	It is Britain's first Paralympic slope medal in 20 years and means the team has already bettered its haul from Vancouver four years ago. 
	Etherington and Powell had not even met a year ago, and this was only their third competitive downhill run together. 
	The pair communicate on the slopes via radio. 
	There was a worrying moment when Etherington crashed crossing the finish line, but she was soon back on her feet. 
	The 22-year-old trainee teacher from Lincoln, who celebrates her birthday on Sunday, said: ""I can't believe what's just happened. 
	""We knew it was it was a solid run because we were shouting 'go, go, go' and we had good, solid communication. 
	""I'm so proud and excited and I can't wait to get that medal in my hands."" 
	Powell added: ""We were really excited today and we knew that being excited rather than nervous usually means we'll have a good run. I'm so proud of Jade and what she's done."" 
	Etherington's teammate Kelly Gallagher, skiing with her guide Charlotte Evans, finished sixth.

2014-03-10,Driver Who Took Baby On 100mph Chase Is Jailed,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140310100828/http://news.sky.com/story/1222636/driver-who-took-baby-on-100mph-chase-is-jailed,"A banned driver who drove a stolen car at 100mph on icy roads with his pregnant girlfriend and a baby in the back seat has been jailed for 22 months. 
	Ashton Dellamonica, 21, took police on an 11-mile chase on Christmas Day last year after he was spotted by officers in an unmarked car in Nottingham. 
	He avoided a police stinger operation on the A610 to burst the vehicle's tyres before continuing on at speeds in excess of 100mph. 
	A police helicopter filmed Dellamonica driving through six sets of red lights before he crashed the stolen Audi in The Meadows area of the city. 
	Police then continued to chase him on foot. 
	He was arrested after police found him hiding under a parked car in a residential street. 
	Detective Constable Emma Pollard, of Radford Road CID, said: ""Officers involved said they had not seen such dangerous driving in years of policing. 
	""Anyone seeing the footage of his driving will be shocked that no one was seriously hurt by such wilful and dangerous behaviour. 
	""Claiming he was concerned about a small amount of cannabis on his person, he chose to risk the life of his unborn child, his girlfriend, brother and baby, by driving at speeds of more than 100mph in icy and wet conditions. 
	""I am pleased with the sentencing and I hope it sends out a message that we will not tolerate this kind of behaviour in our communities."" 
	Earlier this week, Dellamonica pleaded guilty to charges of dangerous driving, driving while disqualified, and having no insurance.

	Malala Yousafzai, the schoolgirl who was shot by the Taliban in Pakistan in 2012, also appeared on stage. 
	""Your most powerful tool, your most powerful weapon is your voice,"" she said. 
	The We Day format is already popular in the US and Canada, where events have been held since 2007. 
	Its goal is to ""empower a generation to shift the world from 'me' to 'we', through how we act, how we give, the choices we make"". 
	Entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson, who helped organise the event with his daughter Holly, told Sky News: ""We are very lucky, everybody wants to get into a position to be able to make a difference and if you get into that position you've got to make a difference so we are very fortunate.""
