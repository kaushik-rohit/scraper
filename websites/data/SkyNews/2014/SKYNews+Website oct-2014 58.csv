Two war planes provided air support to the Kurdish forces on the ground who were battling IS fighters in the northwest of the country. The Ministry of Defence said the ""successful precision attack"" was carried out with a Paveway IV guided bomb overnight. The strikes came as militants took control of most of the western Iraqi town of Hit in Anbar province. IS has declared territories it controls in Iraq and Syria a 'caliphate' ""Ninety percent of the town of Hit has been overrun by militants,"" said Adnan al Fahdawi, a provincial council member. The United Nations report, based on nearly 500 interviews, found the Islamist militant group had carried out mass executions, abducted women and girls as sex slaves, and used children as fighters.

The red circle shows the path of the missile fired at the vehicle The strikes were the first since MPs voted to support aerial raids in Iraq last Friday The targets were in the northwest of Iraq The moment the truck, which had a mounted machine gun, was destroyed by a Brimstone missile A plume of smoke rose above the area The strike was successful, according to an initial assessment, said Defence Secretary Michael Fallon The Tornados safely returned to their base at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus after the sortie Six of the GR4 fighter jets are based on the island in the Mediterranean The aircraft began their combat missions on Saturday ""These include attacks directly targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure, executions and other targeted killings of civilians, abductions, rape and other forms of sexual and physical violence perpetrated against women and children, forced recruitment of children, destruction or desecration of places of religious or cultural significance, wanton destruction and looting of property, and denial of fundamental freedoms,"" the report said. It also said the acts of violence over a nine-week period included the systematic targeting of diverse ethnic and religious communities - including Turkmen, Shabak, Christians and Yazidis - aimed at ""destroying, suppressing or cleansing them"" from areas under IS control. IS, formerly known as ISIL, has declared the establishment of a ""caliphate"" - or Islamic state - on the territories it occupies in Iraq and Syria. ""The array of violations and abuses perpetrated by ISIL and associated armed groups is staggering, and many of their acts may amount to war crimes or crimes against humanity,"" said UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein. The report also found airstrikes by Iraqi government forces had caused ""significant civilian deaths and injuries"". The UK is supporting Iraqi and Kurdish forces battling Sunni Muslim extremists from IS, which has taken over large parts of Iraq in recent months. Calls have been growing for strikes against the group's Syrian strongholds too. However, a vote in Parliament last Friday did not include the authorisation of airstrikes in Syria. Turkey has approved a motion allowing its troops to be sent into Iraq and Syria. Meanwhile, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau dismissed Nigerian military claims of his death, and said the group was ""running our... Islamic caliphate"" in captured towns. ""Here I am, alive. I will only die the day Allah takes my breath,"" he said in a video obtained by the AFP news agency."

The body of the 14-year-old schoolgirl was recovered from the River Brent in west London on Tuesday and is being examined at Uxbridge Mortuary. Police have said the examination may not be completed on Thursday. The case is being treated as a murder inquiry and police said ""significant efforts"" were taken to hide the remains. Alice's parents say they are 'completely devastated' Alice's parents have said they haver been ""completely devastated"" by the discovery of their daughter's body. Rosalind Hodgkiss and Jose Gross said their daughter was ""quirky"" and ""beautiful inside and out"". ""It is difficult to comprehend that our sweet and beautiful daughter was the victim of a terrible crime,"" they said in a statement. ""Why anyone would want to hurt her is something that we are struggling to come to terms with. ""Alice was a loving and much loved daughter and sister, a quirky live spark of a girl, beautiful inside and out.

She was last seen on CCTV walking along the towpath of the Grand Union Canal towards Hanwell. Convicted murderer Arnis Zalkalns, who was filmed cycling along the same route  shortly after Alice, has emerged as the prime suspect in the case.

More than 300 police officers have been involved in the search, the biggest in London since the 7/7 bombings. Brentside High School, where Alice was a pupil, described her as ""outstanding"".

2014-10-02,The Bank of England (BoE) has said it wants legal power to cap the ratios used for mortgage applicant approvals.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20141002101312/http://news.sky.com/story/1346039/boe-wants-powers-to-cap-loan-to-value-ratio,"The Bank of England (BoE) has said it wants legal power to cap the ratios used for mortgage applicant approvals. The bank's plan is to expand its ability to curb mortgage lending for homes. Lenders are currently limited to not exceeding 15% of loans being above the ratio of 4.5 times the applicant's income, known as the loan-to-value (LTV). It also wants to cap buy-to-let properties, with limits on ratios of interest and debt-to-income. In June, Chancellor George Osborne said he was willing to give expanded powers to the central bank. On Monday at the Conservative Party conference he reaffirmed the position and said he wanted it enacted before the next election. The BoE spelled out its position, especially for buy-to-let loans, which currently make up 12% of new mortgages. It said this would include an 'interest coverage ratio' to provide a buffer ensuring rental income is comfortably higher than interest payments. Professional investors' easy access to buy-to-let mortgages have been seen by some as a reason why barriers prevent prospective homeowner climbing the property ladder. The BoE's Financial Policy Committee (FPC) gained its first set of legal powers in April last year. But the issue was seen as politically hot and not for the FPC to decide the final ratio figure. Further afield, the BoE also gave a clean bill of health to the Government's Help To Buy mortgage guarantee scheme. The scheme was considered controversial by critics, who said it risked pushing up house prices. But the bank said Help To Buy was not to blame for rising values, as it only accounted for some 5% of purchases. It was also most commonly used in areas where price increases have been modest.

2014-10-02,"Payday lender Wonga has said it will write off the debts of 330,000 customers whose loans would not have been approved under new affordability guidelines.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20141002101312/http://news.sky.com/story/1346016/wonga-writes-off-330000-customers-debts,"Payday lender Wonga has said it will write off the debts of 330,000 customers whose loans would not have been approved under new affordability guidelines. Sky sources said the cost of writing off the debt to the company would be £35m. There is £220m debt outstanding for the customers affected, at an average loan value of £667 per borrower. The short-term lender said it would contact the borrowers by October 10. City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said the 330,000 customers who are currently in excess of 30 days in arrears will have the balance of their loan written off and therefore owe Wonga nothing. And some 45,000 customers who are between zero and 29 days in arrears will be asked to repay their debt without interest and charges and will be given an option of paying off their debt over an extended period of four months. Wonga currently offers a fixed interest rate of 365% per annum, and gives an example of £150 borrowed for 18 days attracting an interest total of £27.99. With its ""transmission fee"" of £5.50, the total one-off payment for the £150 is £183.49, representative of an annual percentage rate of 5,853%. Wonga founder Errol Damelin resigned his chairman's role in June Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, who criticised the lender last year, welcomed the move but said the major issue was to create a reformed financial system. ""The big issue is to create a financial system that gives access to the poor and hope for the poorest in our lands, to be able to flourish and develop and have proper access to finance, not just for loans but for savings,"" he said. ""For lives in which finance is a good servant, not a bad master."" The default write-off news comes just days after the company reported a massive drop in earnings. Wonga's annual profit dropped by 53%, after the payday lender came under fire for the tactics it uses to reclaim money from borrowers in default. It said full-year pre-tax profit in the 12 months to 31 December was £39.7m, down from £84.5m a year earlier. The company was criticised over its previous tactic of sending customers in default fake legal letters. FCA director of supervision Clive Adamson said: ""We are determined to drive up standards in the consumer credit market and it is disappointing that some firms still have a way to go to meet our expectations. ""This should put the rest of the industry on notice - they need to lend affordably and responsibly. ""It is absolutely right that Wonga’s new management team has acted quickly to put things right for their customers after these issues were raised by the FCA."" The announcement was made after new Wonga chairman Andy Haste completed discussions with the FCA. Mr Haste said: ""It's clear to me that the need for change at Wonga is real and urgent. ""Our regulator is determined to improve standards in consumer credit and I share that determination. ""There is much to do in order to make Wonga a sustainable and accepted business, and today’s announcement is a significant step forward in that process."" He added: ""We want to ensure we only lend to those who can reasonably afford the loan in question and during my review, it became clear to me that this has unfortunately not always been the case. ""I agreed with the concerns expressed by the FCA and as a consequence of our discussions we have committed to taking these actions."""

Officers are in talks with the Crown Prosecution Service after being handed a dossier of more than 80 pages of Tweets, Facebook posts and messages on online forums aimed at Kate and Gerry McCann. Over the past few years hundreds of shocking messages have been posted by 'trolls' who believe - despite no evidence - that the McCanns had some involvement in the disappearance of their daughter in Portugal in 2007. These include suggestions that the McCanns should be tortured and killed and calls for them to ""burn in hell"". Some messages are even directed at Madeleine's younger siblings, now aged nine. Manipulated images involving the McCanns - many of them graphic - are also in wide circulation online. One troll - who uses the Twitter identity ""Sweepyface"" and has posted dozens of anti-McCann messages using the #mccann hashtag - was confronted by Sky News. When asked about her use of social media to attack the couple, she replied: ""I'm entitled to."" The dossier - compiled by members of the public alarmed at the online treatment of the McCanns and shown to Sky News - calls on police and MPs to act to crack down on such abuse. The Met wrote to the campaigners: ""In consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service and the McCann family the material will now be assessed and decisions made as to what further action if any should be undertaken."" Among the messages identified in the dossier is an exchange on a message board which reads: ""These 2 should burn in hell""; ""I will supply the petrol""; ""I'll supply the lighter - happily"". Other posts include: ""We need some numbers for some assassins on taps"", ""I hope that the McCanns are living in total misery"" and ""I want to see them smashed up the back of a bus or trampled by horses"". In one of her tweets ""Sweepyface"" called for the McCanns to suffer ""for the rest of their miserable lives"". In addition to threats and abuse, several trolls have claimed to live nearby to the McCanns in Leicestershire and reported on their movements. The campaigner spearheading the appeal - who has asked to remain anonymous - told Sky News: ""We're very worried that it's only going to take somebody to act out of some of these discussions, some of the threats that have been made, and we couldn't live with ourselves if that happened and we had done nothing."" Author Anthony Summers, whose book Looking for Madeleine was published last month, said: ""There is a campaign of hatred against the parents. ""It is venomous and vitriolic, most of it done by cowards. We are taken aback by the extent of the sheer evil behind it all."" Sara Payne has become a campaigner for parents' right to a controlled access to the Sex Offenders Register since her daughter, Sarah, was murdered in 2000. Responding to the story of the abuse against the McCanns on Twitter, she wrote: ""About time, they are certainly not the only victims but they are the most abused. ""I hope this means this kind of disgusting abuse will finally be stopped."" :: At 2pm we will be hosting a Twitter Q&A with crime correspondent Martin Brunt on our exclusive story about the abuse Madeleine McCann's parents have suffered online.

The artwork - which shows a group of pigeons holding anti-immigration placards in front of an exotic-looking foreign bird - appeared on a wall in Clacton-on-Sea after the local Conservative MP Douglas Carswell defected to UKIP. The signs included ""Migrants Not Welcome"", ""Go Back To Africa"" and ""Keep Off Our Worms"". Tendring District Council, which removed the work, said it did not know the piece was by the famous artist, and has invited Banksy to come back to paint another mural. Banksy often uses stencils and graffiti to make comments about society.

Nigel Brown, communications manager for the council, said it had been inundated with complaints about the removal of the artwork. However, he said it was council policy to remove anything deemed ""offensive and racist"" within 48 hours. He told Sky News: ""I have personally had emails from all over the country calling for my resignation, and how I got it wrong. ""It was the wording on the banners that a person found offensive and contacted us. ""Had we known it was a Banksy, I am not saying we wouldn't have done the same thing. However, we do appreciate the social comment."" He added: ""We would obviously welcome an appropriate Banksy original on any of our seafronts and would be delighted if he returned in the future."" Mr Carswell's defection has triggered a by-election in Clacton on October 9.

2014-10-02,"More than 500 GP practices in England face being closed because of a looming ""workforce crisis"", experts have said.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20141002101312/http://news.sky.com/story/1345900/gp-practices-face-closure-due-to-doctor-shortage,"More than 500 GP practices in England face being closed because of a looming ""workforce crisis"", experts have said. The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) said a large number of family doctors were nearing retirement and unless action was taken there will not be enough replacements for them. It means thousands of people could be left without a GP or will have to travel miles to see one, the RCGP added. The warning comes after David Cameron pledged access to a GP seven days a week if the Conservatives are returned to power next May. Dr Maureen Baker, RCGP chairwoman, told the college's annual conference in Liverpool the number of people entering the profession was falling short of the numbers leaving it. As well as retiring, family doctors are leaving Britain to work abroad or pursuing alternative careers. The RCGP said the number of unfilled GP posts has quadrupled in the last three years from 2.1% in 2010 to 7.9% in 2013. At the same time estimates suggest applications for GP training have dropped by around 15%. Dr Baker called for the budget for general practice to be increased to help meet the shortfall. ""Today, I can reveal new estimates from the College that 543 practices in England are at risk of closure if something isn't done,"" she said. ""There are practices that have over 90% of GPs over the age of 60, when the average retirement age of GPs is 59. This is shocking. ""With a growing, ageing population, not to mention a baby boom, we need to increase capacity in general practice, not take it away.” Dr Baker added: ""Most worryingly, we are not attracting enough new doctors and nurses into general practice, or doing enough to retain the highly skilled workforce we have."" A Department of Health spokesman said: ""We're increasing trainees so that GP numbers continue to grow faster than the population and will train 10,000 more primary and community health and care staff by 2020, including 5,000 more GPs. ""There are already 1,000 more GPs than in 2010 and we're making it easier for GPs to return to the profession."""

It said Q3 British like-for-like sales in the 13 weeks to 28 September reached 12.9%. The firm said the rise in the summer period was down to an improving economy and increased appetite for its promotion deals. It was the fourth quarter of double digit growth. UK sales for the year were up 11.8%. Domino's continues to ride the digital wave, with almost 71% of orders placed online in the quarter, up from 62.4% a year ago. It has revamped its website and boosted use of its smartphone app. The company, which is valued at almost £1bn, said it also expects to stay on target to open between 40 to 50 new UK outlets before the end of the year. Chief executive David Wild said: ""We are delighted with the like-for-like performance in our core UK business. ""We face more challenging comparatives for the final quarter, but we remain confident of a satisfactory outcome for the year."" Although sales rose in Britain, Ireland and Switzerland, they dropped by 9.9% in Germany. Domino's has slowed German expansion while it tries to improve store formats and menus, cut overheads and boost sales at its self-managed outlets, ahead of a franchisee rollout similar to that in the UK. It has nearly 900 stores in operation across Britain."

Gerry McCann said online abuse had caused ""severe distress"" to him and his wife Kate and that police should be more willing to prosecute the perpetrators. He was speaking after Sky's Crime Correspondent Martin Brunt revealed in a special report that Scotland Yard is investigating a dossier of social media abuse targeting the McCanns - whose three-year-old daughter went missing on a family holiday in 2007. When confronted over her actions, one of the trolls, who used the name ""Sweepyface"" online, told Sky News she believed she was ""entitled"" to attack the couple on Twitter. Mr McCann said he had not read the Sweepyface tweets, but he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Clearly something needs to be done about the abuse on the internet. I think we probably need more people to be charged. ""We do not have any significant presence on social media or online and I've got grave concerns about our children as they grow up and start to access the internet in an unsupervised capacity. ""People are threatening to kidnap our children, people are threatening violence against Kate and myself."" He said police should be more willing to charge internet trolls. ""I'm glad to see the law around this area has been reviewed. We need to make examples of people who are causing damage,"" he said. ""It causes us severe distress. There is so much vile nonsense written on the internet."" Mr McCann also branded the Sunday Times ""disgraceful"" after winning a £55,000 libel payout over a story which claimed the couple had deliberately hindered the search for Madeleine, who vanished in Praia da Luz. He said the story showed there had been no change in the newspaper industry as a result of the Leveson Inquiry. ""This damaged us, it damaged the reputation of the fund and it quite potentially can damage the search for Madeleine,"" he said."

Kay was later taken to hospital but never regained consciousness and the heartbeat of her baby, named Lily-Rose, stopped the following day, on April 3. Doctors induced labour and Kay, who had been in a relationship with Robinson for 14 months, was pronounced dead on April 5. In the first letter written from his prison cell to Kay's mother, Robinson said: ""I am so sorry for your loss, my loss as well, lost a daughter as well. ""I've lost everything that mattered to me."" He added, in a second: ""I was hoping that after I waked up and after my jail sentence I would go back into Kay's arms but God took her away in peace, away from my accusations and controlling behaviour. ""All that because I loved and adored her."" The jury heard Robinson had been abusive to Kay throughout their relationship and punched her in the stomach when she informed him she had missed a period. ""He said 'this will stop you having a baby',"" Christopher Quinlan QC, prosecuting, said. A pathologist found 20 separate injuries to her body, from bruising to her cheek and arms and legs to ligature marks from one side of her neck to the other."

They insist their long fight for justice has left them unable to grieve for their daughter who was kidnapped and shot dead on her honeymoon in South Africa four years ago. Shrien Dewani, 34, is accused of hiring a hitman to murder his new bride. The Bristol businessman denies faking the carjacking of their taxi and fleeing before Anni Dewani, 28, was driven off to her death. Her father, Vinod Hindocha, 65, told Sky News: ""We really hope we get to know what happened to Anni. That's all we are asking for. ""Shrien, tell us the truth, tell us what's happened. You were there. ""Anni had no right to die the way she did. This is not acceptable, the way she left us."" This week the Hindocha family were packing their suitcases at their home in Mariestad, Sweden, for the 6,000-mile journey to Cape Town, where the trial is due to start on Monday. Anni's mother, Nilam, 62, said: ""I hope we get justice. And I would love to hear what Shrien has to say. ""They say time will heal the wounds, but they get deeper and deeper. Let's hope we get justice and we can move ahead with our lives."" Shrien Dewani was extradited to South Africa in April after fighting extradition for three years. He had claimed he was mentally unfit to stand trial, but psychiatrists eventually agreed he was well enough to be treated in a Cape Town clinic, where more doctors said he was ready for the court case. Dewani denies murder, arguing that he loved his wife and had no motive to have her killed. The prosecution is expected to suggest he is gay and wanted to escape his marriage. Anni's elder sister, Ami Denborg, 37, revealed: ""Three weeks before the wedding Anni actually threw the ring back at Shrien. ""She called me and said a lot of things, like it wasn't working well. ""I thought she was just stressed out and told her she would get over it. ""Looking back, I should have told her to break it off. If I had, maybe she would be alive today. It still haunts me."" Three local men have already been jailed for Anni's murder. One of them, taxi driver Zola Tongo, told police Dewani offered him £1,300 to arrange for her to be killed."
2014-10-04,The BBC has dismissed accusations that Top Gear deliberately chose a car with a number plate appearing to refer to the Falklands War to cause controversy while filming in Argentina.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20141004094010/http://news.sky.com/story/1346704/top-gear-team-driven-out-of-argentina,"The BBC has dismissed accusations that Top Gear deliberately chose a car with a number plate appearing to refer to the Falklands War to cause controversy while filming in Argentina. The programme's cast and crew are flying out of the country after facing protests from politicians and army veterans. Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond were reportedly among those who had to abandon their cars at the roadside and flee after being pelted with stones by an angry crowd. The team used a Porsche with the registration number H982 FKL, which some people suggested could be seen to refer to the conflict which took place in 1982. A group of war veterans protested outside their hotel and one local politician said they were escorted to the airport. Juan Manuel Romano, secretary of social development for Ushuaia in southern Tierra del Fuego province, said: ""They have taken the decision to leave."" The BBC confirmed they were leaving the country, although show bosses have said the number plate was merely a coincidence. The programme has already run into problems this year, with one episode found to be in breach of Ofcom's broadcasting code for the use of a racially offensive term during a two-part special filmed in Burma, following a complaint from a couple of viewers. And Clarkson apologised after unbroadcast footage emerged in which he appeared to use the N-word, although he denied actually saying it. The team from the show are in South America filming a special on a remote highway passing through Chile and Argentina. Executive producer Andy Wilman said: ""Top Gear production purchased three cars for a forthcoming programme; to suggest that this car was either chosen for its number plate, or that an alternative number plate was substituted for the original is completely untrue."""

Sam Tree was jailed for three-and-a-half years, while his wife Joan, 62, was handed a two-year prison sentence and ordered to carry out 300 hours of unpaid work in the community for her role in the scam which earned them about £2m. An example of the fake bomb detectors which were sold by Sam and Joan Tree The 68-year-old claimed the dud devices - of which he made some 1,500 in his garden shed in Dunstable, Bedfordshire - could track down explosives, drugs and people - including missing Madeleine McCann. Detectives heralded the sentencing as the ""concluding act in a highly complex, extensive and significant investigation"". The pair were associated with three other British con artists convicted of making fake detectors. It is believed the criminals made around £80m from the scam. Gary Bolton, of Chatham, Kent, was jailed last August for seven years, James McCormick, of Langport, Somerset, for 10 years last May and Anthony Williamson, of Gosport, Hampshire, was also convicted last May. They were sold around the world including in Iraq, Lebanon and Mexico Detective Constable Joanne Law, of City of London Police, described the device - known as the Alpha 6 -  as an empty hand-held, plastic, rectangular unit with a free-swinging aerial on the front which had a card inside marked with the explosive, substance or person it was designed to locate. She told Sky News: ""We received information some years ago that these hand-held devices were being sold internationally, predominantly in Iraq. ""We were able to secure one of the devices and test it. We quickly realised that these devices were not capable of finding explosives. ""We found a handle which had a picture of Madeleine McCann inside of it, and they claimed they used that to try and locate Madeleine. Gary Bolton (Top) and James McCormick were convicted of the scam last year ""They said the picture was enough to excite neutrons and ions within the device to make the antenna work. They also claimed static electricity generated by your body when you walk was enough to power the device. There are no batteries in it - no electrical equipment at all."" The officer said the detectors and the so-called science behind them were examined by experts who concluded ""it's absolute rubbish, none of it is true"". She added: ""They decided people's lives were not worth considering, above their own greed."" The Trees were found guilty at the Old Bailey in August of making an article for use in a fraud between January 2007 and July 2012. Passing sentence at London's Kingston Crown Court on Friday, Judge Richard Marks QC told the couple: ""The aerial would point to the vicinity or direction of the objects or person being looked at. ""One only has to look at the facts to see this as a bizarre and fantastic proposition as to be almost akin to something out of Alice in Wonderland."""

The Prime Minister said the murder was ""brutal"" and revealed ""just how barbaric and repulsive these terrorists are"". A video lasting one minute and 11 seconds and titled Another Message To America And It's Allies, was posted on YouTube on Friday evening. It shows Mr Henning, a taxi-driver who was captured on an aid mission in Syria in December, kneeling in front of a knife-wielding militant in a desert setting before being beheaded in front of the camera. The masked killer, who speaks with a British accent and is believed to be the man responsible for previous beheadings, makes a direct statement to Mr Cameron: ""The blood of David Haines was on your hands, Cameron. Alan Henning will also be slaughtered, but his blood is on the hands of the British Parliament."" At the end of the video another hostage - a former US soldier - is paraded in front of the cameras. The hostage is believed to be Peter Edward Kassig who had returned to the region as a charity worker, after serving in Iraq in 2007. The militant in the video says Mr Kassig will be the next victim.  Mr Cameron, who is meeting at Chequers with officials from the Foreign Office, intelligence agencies and the military, said: ""The brutal murder of Alan Henning by ISIL shows just how barbaric and repulsive these terrorists are. ""My thoughts and prayers tonight are with Alan's wife Barbara, their children and all those who loved him. ""Alan had gone to Syria to help get aid to people of all faiths in their hour of need.

""Alan Henning's murderers have clearly gone against that spirit of Islam. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family."" Mr Henning was previously seen at the end of a video released last month following the beheading of fellow British captive David Haines.

In an interview with The Times, Mr Clegg also accused Chancellor George Osborne of balancing the books ""on the backs of the poor"" following the Tories' pledge to increase the personal tax allowance to £12,500. Speaking ahead of his party's annual conference in Glasgow, the Deputy Prime Minister attacked the move and declared: ""Compassionate Conservatism is dead."" The party previously said there would be no new runways in the South East On airports, the party previously insisted there would be no expansion in the South East because of local issues of air and noise pollution, but the party's position on Gatwick may be softening, according to the paper. Mr Clegg said technological advances would help negate the environmental impact of flying and pave the way for airport expansion. ""I do happen to think the environmental impact can … be consistent with some form of airport expansion given the rapid improvement in environmental performance of modern aircraft,"" he said. Mr Clegg will also attempt to energise activists at a rally in Glasgow tonight amid disconcerting poll ratings which put the party's support as low as 6%. Party activists will vote this weekend whether to commit an extra £1bn in funds to the NHS over two years. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said the commitment would be funded from limits on tax relief on pension pots for high earners. ""A comprehensive health service paid for by the taxpayer and delivered free at the point of need was a Liberal idea and is a central part of our vision of a stronger economy and a fairer society,"" he said. ""We will raise this extra money from asking the better-off to contribute a little more in tax. ""This Liberal Democrat commitment is fully and fairly funded. It is in stark contrast to the Conservatives, who have explicitly stated they will target working people on lower incomes to carry the heaviest burden."" Meanwhile, a poll of 735 party members for the website Liberal Democrat Voice showed 80% continue to support the coalition, but two-thirds expect the party to slip below 40 MPs at the next election."

They are tied to gates, lampposts and door-knockers in an expression of community solidarity with the taxi driver's family. Bill Green, pastor in Mr Henning's home town of Eccles, told Sky News: ""Eccles is waking up to this horrific news this morning and I think the community is going to be devastated. It is a close knit community, especially where Alan and his family lived."" He said the news was ""gut-wrenching"".

Few words or gestures can provide comfort to the family of the father-of-two now, but so deep is the sense of local support that they are sure to be surrounded by heartfelt goodwill and sympathy. Just days ago Mr Henning's wife Barbara made a direct appeal to his captors to spare her husband's life.  Her plea came after she had received an audio message in which her husband begged for his life. Mrs Henning said: ""I ask Islamic State please release him, we need him back home."" She added: ""Some say wrong time, wrong place. Alan was volunteering with his Muslim friends to help the people of Syria. He was in the right place doing the right thing."" Mrs Henning said the family were at a loss as to why those leading IS could not open their hearts and minds to the truth about Alan's humanitarian motives for going to Syria. She told news channels: ""Surely those who wish to be seen as a state will act in a statesmanlike way by showing mercy and providing clemency."" A few days earlier in 47-year-old Mr Henning's home town of Eccles, hundreds of people gathered for a prayer vigil in the local town hall. At the event he was described as a compassionate and caring man who was willing to give up his own family Christmas to help others less fortunate in Syria. Many signed a book of prayers for his family.  Gallery: Profile: Alan Henning Alan Henning, 47, was born in Salford, Greater Manchester.

Officers also found three mobile phones which contained photos of large quantities of cash and drugs, according to a Nottinghamshire Police statement. The phones also had images of Shaw handling and preparing drugs, the statement added. Detective Constable Steve Fenyn said Shaw was ""literally caught in the act on his camera"".

Speaking to Sky News from the party's conference in Glasgow, the Deputy Prime Minister accused Chancellor George Osborne of defying the prevailing economic wisdom by trying to cut the UK's national deficit without tax hikes on the rich and instead focusing on cuts in public spending and welfare. He said his party would insist on around 20% of the £100bn deficit being paid off through higher taxes on the rich, such as their proposed £1.5bn ""mansion tax"" or a £1bn reduction in tax breaks for wealthy people's pensions. But he refused to give more details of his ""red lines"" in any coalition negotiations. He said: ""I know that George Osborne has decided - in a way that I don't think you'll find a single mainstream economist in the world agreeing with him - that you can balance the books by only asking the working-age poor to make additional sacrifices or only by gouging out more and more money from unprotected public services like the police, social services, social care and education. ""It's got to be a balance and we've broadly kept that balance during this coalition Government. ""I think, in taxation, you should start at the top and work down, not start at the bottom."" Mr Clegg signalled a more aggressive approach to the Lib Dems coalition partners, as Vince Cable launched a stinging attack on ""lying"" Tories who suggest the Government can balance its books without raising taxes. David Cameron had used his speech to the Tory Party conference to unveil his crowd-pleasing plan to raise the threshold for the 40p rate of tax to £50,000 - taking millions of middle income earners out of the higher tax band. At the same time the Prime Minister promised a Conservative government would eliminate the deficit in the public finances by 2018 - and would achieve its target purely by cutting spending and without putting up taxes. This was dismissed by Mr Cable in his keynote speech to the Liberal Democrat party conference in Glasgow. The Business Secretary said: ""The truth is more taxes will be needed. To contribute to deficit reduction and also to address unacceptable inequalities. ""Any politician who tells you that the next Government can balance the budget and avoid tax increases is lying to you."" And his comments were backed by former Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown, who said they were ""truthful"". Lord Ashdown told Sky News: ""I stick with Vince's words. Any party that tells you that we can balance what is a phenomenal deficit problem still to be tackled, which has now had not £12bn, but probably of the order of £40bn added to it by the Prime Minister's promise of tax cuts, without saying a word about where they will come from, is not telling the truth. ""You have two levers, two mechanisms, to control the deficit, to reduce the deficit, and to control the economy. ""One is public expenditure cuts and the other is taxes. It's simply economically illiterate to throw one of those away."""

The masonry came off a building in Cliff Street, in the seaside town of Bridlington, East Yorkshire, and struck the victim and a parked vehicle on Monday afternoon. A police spokesman said the area would remain sealed off until checks on the building are completed. The force said it was too early to say whether the stormy weather caused the bricks to collapse. Sky News weather producer Rebecca Yussuf said rain in the area was accompanied by gale-force winds at around the time the tragedy happened at 1pm. She said: ""Mean wind speeds reached 34mph, with gusts of 48mph."" Gusts reached up to 48mph in Bridlington at around 1pm on Monday The first storm of the autumn swept across the country on Monday. Gale force winds reached 84mph overnight on South Uist in the Western Isles, damaging power lines. Northern Ireland Electricity said around 6,000 customers lost power overnight, while some 6,500 homes were hit with blackouts in the Republic, with the vast majority reconnected by the evening. Around 2,000 homes were affected in Workington, Cumbria, with most having supply restored within an hour. Heavy rain and strong winds are expected to move north overnight, with gusts expected to reach 70mph in the most exposed areas on Tuesday. An elderly man trapped on an island at Marykirk on the River Esk in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, was rescued by a sled boat as heavy rain saw water levels rise rapidly.

The woman was returning from a trip to Everest base camp, at 5,364 metres (17,700 feet) above sea level, with her daughter when she reported respiratory problems. They stopped for a night at a hotel in Khumjung on their way to the capital Kathmandu. Purushottam Silwal, a local police official, said: ""She possibly died of altitude sickness. ""Her body was airlifted to Kathmandu for a post-mortem."" Altitude sickness happens when people ascend heights too quickly, as the decreased atmosphere pressure makes breathing difficult and causes headaches, dizziness, nausea and exhaustion. October is peak trekking season in the Himalayan nation, which is home to eight of the world's 14 highest mountains. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: ""We were notified of the death of a British national in Nepal on 6 October, 2014. ""We stand ready to provide consular assistance to the family at this difficult time."""

Dappy, who was tried under his real name Costadinos Contostavlos, was found guilty last month of punching a man on the dancefloor of the Evissa nightclub in Reading. District Judge Davinder Lachhar told the sentencing hearing at Reading Magistrates' Court that the matter should be dealt with at Guildford Crown Court. She said this was because the 27-year-old committed the offence while serving a six-month suspended sentence handed down by that court for a previous affray and assault, which could now be activated. Dappy seemed relieved that he was given bail The judge told the court: ""This is a man who obviously has violent tendencies, to put it mildly."" Contostavlos's barrister, Jon Harrison, replied that his client ""accepts he has issues surrounding confrontation"". Before adjourning the hearing, the judge said the singer's conviction meant he was ""in breach"" of the previous suspended sentence. She added: ""Certainly from my part I would be thinking of a custodial sentence but it's only right that the same court should sentence you."" Contostavlos, who entered the courtroom with a large black holdall, held his hands out in prayer as the judge gave her decision. After being granted unconditional bail, he said ""thank you madam"" before breathing an audible sigh of relief and looking to the ceiling with his head against the glass window of the dock. As he left the court building, the troubled star posed for a photograph with a young fan before telling reporters: ""How do I feel? I'm free."" Last month's trial heard the fight broke out in the early hours of October 6 last year because Contostavlos, from Hatfield in Hertfordshire, began chatting to Devonn Reid's female friend and girlfriend at the club's bar, and that the singer punched him after Mr Reid told him not to talk to them."

""I personally have never wanted to 'have it all' like a general aim. ""I just want to have what men have. You know, lots of men have a successful professional life or what looks like success to them, and they have put that together with the family. That is what I want to have. ""There will be other women who don't want to have that, and I think that that is also important to realise that the 'all' is quite different to lots of different women, and indeed to lots of different men.

2014-10-06,A mass killer who shot dead five people in 1978 has been detained indefinitely after admitting to making an improvised explosive device following his release from prison.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20141006225208/http://news.sky.com/story/1348212/mass-killer-harry-street-detained-indefinitely,"A mass killer who shot dead five people in 1978 has been detained indefinitely after admitting to making an improvised explosive device following his release from prison. The former Broadmoor patient, who was released from indefinite detention in the 1990s, was caught with the home-made bomb last year. More than 50 home-made bullets, two pistols and a revolver were also found at the 70-year-old's home in Birmingham. The arsenal was amassed during a six-year campaign of harassment against his neighbours. In sentencing Street, Mr Justice Blair told the pensioner he would be detained in a maximum security hospital and may never be released. Street, originally called Barry Williams, was detained under mental health laws in 1979 for the manslaughter of three of his neighbours in West Bromwich and a couple who ran a petrol station in Warwickshire. He had been due to stand trial at Birmingham Crown Court accused of making the explosive and possessing three firearms with intent to endanger life. But he changed his plea over possessing the home-made device. He had already pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to three charges of possessing a prohibited firearm and one count of putting a neighbour in fear of violence. Street was caught with a home-made bomb last year Prosecutor Michael Duck QC said the Crown accepted Street's not guilty plea to four other charges. No further action will be taken on those charges after consultation with witnesses. Mr Duck told the court: ""It is quite apparent and would have been the Crown's case, that this man commits offences of the utmost seriousness when he is mentally unwell. ""The overwhelming balance of medical opinion is that this is a significant problem that will take a very significant time to resolve, if it ever does."" Detective Chief Superintendent Kenny Bell from West Midlands police said the sentence handed to Street followed tenacious police work. ""There was no trace of Harry Street on any police systems; but it is thanks to the tenacity of a local police officer who, when the harassment escalated, made extensive checks which led her to Street's GP and his true identity,"" he said. ""Immediate steps have already been taken to ensure that all relevant information is shared and is accessible. ""A MAPPA Serious Case Review has been commissioned and I am determined that lessons will be learned."" Street is being treated at the high-security Ashworth Hospital on Merseyside. He earlier admitted throwing items at a neighbour's roof, banging and drilling walls late at night and making threats to a neighbour. On 26 October 1978 he killed George Burkitt, his wife Iris and their son Philip at their home on West Bromwich's Bustleholme Mill estate. The husband and wife were both shot in the head and their son was shot through the heart. He then drove to Stockingford, near Nuneaton, where he killed Michel and Lisa Di Maria by firing shots through an office window. He was caught following a high-speed car chase across the Peak District in Derbyshire and officers found more than 900 bullets and a 0.22-calibre pistol inside his car."
2014-10-06,A British millionaire accused of murdering his wife on their honeymoon in South Africa has told a judge he is bisexual.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20141006225208/http://news.sky.com/story/1348138/shrien-dewani-tells-court-he-is-bisexual,"A British millionaire accused of murdering his wife on their honeymoon in South Africa has told a judge he is bisexual. Shrien Dewani, 34, denies orchestrating his wife's death by hiring three men to kill the 28-year-old as they drove through Cape Town's Gugulethu Township on 13 November, 2010. Appearing at Western Cape High Court in Cape Town, the care home owner denied charges of murder, conspiracy to commit kidnapping, robbery with aggravating circumstances, kidnapping and defeating the ends of justice. He told judge Jeanette Traverso: ""I plead not guilty to all five counts, my lady."" Through a witness statement read to the court by his solicitor Francois van Zyl, he also told the court he was bisexual. In it, he said: ""My sexual interactions with males were mostly physical experiences or email chats with people I met online or in clubs, including prostitutes."" Footage of the crime scene, including Anni's body inside the taxi, were also shown to the court. The court heard Dewani had abnormally low levels of hormones and that he and his wife were unlikely to have children. He said he had discussed this with Anni, whom he began dating in summer 2009. Their relationship broke down, but they got back together in March 2010 and married later that year in Mumbai. Dewani said the carjacking in Cape Town was a ""traumatic experience which resulted in the loss of my wife"". He added he has suffered ""flashbacks, nightmares and anxiety attacks"" since, which has affected his ability to remember clearly. Mr van Zyl said his client remembered banging noises coming from the front of the car during the carjacking. Dewani added: ""The next thing I recall is somebody next to me, who told me to lie down. The person had a gun in his hand. He was waving the gun in the air."" Anni Dewani's family, including her father Vinod Hindocha and mother Nilam, were among those in a packed courtroom on Monday. Prosecutors claim Dewani conspired with Zola Tongo, Mziwamadoda Qwabe and Xolile Mngeni to kill his wife. All three are already serving jail terms in connection with Anni's murder. He claims he and his wife were kidnapped at gunpoint as they drove through the township. The court heard Anni Dewani was screaming inside the taxi and he was ordered to keep her quiet as they were driven by another driver. Dewani said he was ordered to get out of the car with a gun to his head and he had to climb out of a window because the door would not open. He added: ""The last thing I had said to Anni was to be quiet and not to say anything."" Dewani was released unharmed, but his wife's body was found in the abandoned taxi the following day with gunshot wounds to the hand and neck. Before the trial, he was detained in a hospital in Britain with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder and has spent the last three years fighting extradition to South Africa. It is unclear if Dewani will give evidence in his defence. The case is due to run until December. The trial continues."

2014-10-09,British troops are to be deployed to Sierra Leone on a mission to help fight the spiralling ebola outbreak in West Africa.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20141009020101/http://news.sky.com/story/1349584/uk-soldiers-deployed-to-ebola-epicentre,"British troops are to be deployed to Sierra Leone on a mission to help fight the spiralling ebola outbreak in West Africa. Up to 700 soldiers from the Royal Scots Borders 1st Battalion, based in Holywood, Northern Ireland, will eventually be stationed near the capital Freetown. Around 40 troops have already arrived in the country, said the Ministry of Defence, and more are flying out soon. Confirmation of the deployment came as newly released figures from the World Health Organisation said the total number of people killed in the current outbreak had risen to 3,879 as of October 5. The WHO said Sierra Leone and Liberia, the two worst-hit countries, only had a fraction of bed spaces they needed. Speaking about the British Army's response, commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Matt Munro said: ""This is a challenge unlike any, but the point is that we are very well prepared."" He said soldiers were at a very low risk of contracting the virus. The Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship Argus will also sail and moor off the country's coast and could be used to evacuate any British casualties if needed. Three Merlin helicopters will be onboard to fly doctors and personnel to hard-to-reach areas. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said: ""The ebola outbreak in West Africa is already a global threat to public health and it's vital that the UK remains at the forefront of responding to the epidemic. ""We are stepping up significantly the UK's contribution and leadership in work to tackle the outbreak, on land, in the air and at sea. ""At the heart of the package is the commitment to provide more than 750 personnel to help with the establishment of ebola treatment centres and an ebola training academy."" Sky's Deputy Political Editor Joey Jones added: ""At this stage it's all about trying to make sure that you can set up the proper infrastructure, the proper health services in some of those hard to reach areas. ""There's no plan for some sort of evacuation or anything like that."" It comes after David Cameron chaired a lunchtime meeting of the emergency COBRA committee to discuss the UK's response. Four major hospitals in the UK - London's Royal Free Hospital and three others in Sheffield, Newcastle and Liverpool, are on standby to deal with any outbreak in the UK. The hospitals already have infectious disease units and have been lined up to provide ""surge capacity"" if the virus spreads to Britain. Experts have said the UK is the third most likely country outside Africa to report an ebola case, with the WHO warning that sporadic cases in Europe are ""unavoidable"". Texas ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan - the first to be diagnosed with the disease in the US - died at the Texas Presbyterian Hospital on Wednesday, officials said."
2014-10-09,The half-sister of three women who were attacked with a claw hammer as they slept in a hotel room has told a court how she found them unconscious and covered in blood.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20141009020101/http://news.sky.com/story/1349710/hammer-attack-left-sisters-covered-in-blood,"The half-sister of three women who were attacked with a claw hammer as they slept in a hotel room has told a court how she found them unconscious and covered in blood. Ohoud al Najjar, Khulood al Najjar and Fatima al Najjar, from the United Arab Emirates, were staying at the four star Cumberland Hotel in Marble Arch, London, on 6 April. Philip Spence, 32, has admitted grievous bodily harm against the three women at Southwark Crown Court, but denies attempted murder. The court heard he attacked Ohoud, 34, with such force her skull was split open. Sheika al Mheiri, the women's half-sister, missed the attack by minutes after leaving the room to visit her brother, who was staying on another floor of the hotel, and left the lock of the door on the latch so she could get back in. As she returned to the room she heard her two young nieces screaming and found the women inside. She said: ""I saw the blood but still I am confused about what's happening. ""Then I saw her (Ohoud's) head. Half of her head was damaged, I thought she was dead. There was blood everywhere so I took the kids out."" Spence fled the room with a suitcase of valuables including iPads, jewellery and around £1,500 in cash, the court heard. Joanna Griffin, of the London Ambulance Service, said Ohoud's skull had been cracked ""like an egg"" and brain tissue the size of a tennis ball was protruding from it. She said: ""I've never seen anything like that before in my career. I assumed it was a huge force to make that kind of injury. ""I've never seen such excessive violence used before."" Ohoud lost part of her brain, cannot speak and had to have one eye removed. She is not expected to recover. Fatima, 31, suffered damage to her skull, ear and facial nerves. Khulood told the court she believed she was hit more than 30 times on her head, face and arms. Forensic pathologist Dr Ashley Fegan-Earl said all three suffered life-threatening injuries and prosecutor Simon Mayo QC said they only survived because of the skill of surgeons. Spence, from Harlesden, northwest London, is alleged to have planned the attack with Thomas Efremi, 57, from Islington, north London. They both deny conspiracy to commit aggravated burglary. The trial continues."

Now the virus is in Europe, should I panic? No. The infection of the Spanish nurse is almost certainly a one-off. Health workers have to go through a strict de-robing procedure to prevent the virus being transferred from their protective gowns onto their skin. If clothes are removed in the wrong order, if any shortcut is taken on handwashing, or if any sweat is wiped away from the eyes, there can be contamination. It does not mean the virus is on the loose in Europe. The nurse's contacts have been traced and those deemed to be at high risk have been quarantined as a precaution. The general population in the UK - or Spain, for that matter - is at no greater risk of ebola today than it was a week ago. Nurse Teresa Ramos has ebola in Spain Why bring infected health workers back from Africa at all? British doctors and nurses are already treating ebola patients in West Africa. Many more will be on their way within weeks, answering the humanitarian call to help countries that have been overwhelmed by the disease. So far just one - Will Pooley - has been infected and brought back for treatment at London's Royal Free Hospital. He would not have been able to get the best medical care in Sierra Leone, so the Government repatriated him with strict - and successful - quarantine controls. But the International Development Secretary Justine Greening has acknowledged on Sky News there is a risk in transferring patients and a hospital is being built with UK money in Sierra Leone. It will have 12 beds set aside for infected healthcare workers. What about travellers - shouldn't we screen them? Public Health England says there is no reason to check arriving air passengers for ebola symptoms. That's in line with advice from the World Health Organisation. Firstly, it would duplicate the screening of people departing on flights from the affected countries in West Africa. Secondly, British Airways has suspended direct flights between the UK and Sierra Leone and Liberia. So passengers from the region would have to change planes in Paris, Brussels, or many other capitals. Tens of thousands of passengers would have to be checked every day, causing long delays. Thirdly, temperature scans only detect people with symptoms. A Liberian passenger treated in hospital in the US was healthy when he travelled and only developed symptoms several days later. Checks on arrival wouldn't have picked him up. He has now died in a Dallas hospital. So is the NHS prepared? GPs have been sent a symptom checklist by Public Health England. Anybody with a fever, who has recently returned from one of the affected countries in West Africa, will be rapidly risk-assessed. If there is a high chance that their symptoms are due to ebola - rather than malaria or any other tropical disease - they will be quarantined at the Royal Free Hospital in London. What if we get lots of ebola cases? The specialist unit at the Royal Free has two beds. But other NHS hospitals are on standby. The Royal Liverpool, Royal Victoria in Newcastle and Royal Hallamshire in Sheffield are next in line to receive patients. And any hospital with an infectious diseases unit could be adapted with quarantine canopies around beds to safely care for patients."

In his final conference speech before the General Election, the Liberal Democrat leader admitted he was no longer the ""untainted ... fresh-faced outsider"" who rode into the coalition on the back of ""Cleggmania"" in 2010. Mr Clegg accused the Conservatives of lurching right and Labour of lurching left to combat the threat of UKIP, claiming the middle ground for his party ahead of the vote in May. Nick Clegg's speech: word cloud He thanked Ed Miliband for forgetting to mention the deficit in his speech at the Labour party conference, and he thanked the Chancellor George Osborne for announcing he would take away benefits from working age poor - making the party's job easier. Mr Clegg said the Liberal Democrats were the only party to stand for ""decent British values"" and against the politics of ""blame and grievance and fear"" on offer from the other parties and he would ""keep hammering away at the system every single day"". And he said he had debated with Nigel Farage on the European Union because someone had to stand up for ""liberal Britain"". The Deputy Prime Minister listed all of the Lib Dems' triumphs while in Government, including increasing the personal tax allowance - effectively awarding tax cuts to millions - free childcare, better parental leave, gay marriage and the pupil premium for disadvantaged children. He said he would not stand by and see the Tories claiming the credit for all the Liberal Democrats had done, telling activists: ""David Cameron, you can copy our ideas but you will never imitate our values."" Mr Clegg vowed to increase the personal tax free allowance to £11,000 by 2016 and £12,500 by 2020. He accused the Conservatives of plagiarising Liberal Democrat policy with Mr Cameron's conference pledge increase the amount people can earn without being taxed to £12,500 by 2020, which would mean a tax cut for 30 million people.  Increasing the personal allowance was part of the Liberal Democrats' manifesto pledge in 2010 but in the televised leaders debates Mr Cameron told Mr Clegg his plans were unaffordable. Mr Clegg disclosed a conversation with Mr Osborne in which the Chancellor told him: ""I don't want to deliver a Liberal Democrat budget"" In his speech, Mr Clegg also hit back at Home Secretary Theresa May for ""playing on people's fears simply to try and get your own way"". In her speech to the Tory conference last week, Mrs May accused the Lib Dems of putting children's lives at risk by opposing measures that would allow intelligence agencies access to all phone, internet and email records. Mr Clegg said: ""Your Communications Data Bill was disproportionate, disempowering - we blocked it once and we'd do it again. ""There are times when the state needs to keep its nose out of our lives, to give us the freedom to make the most of our lives."" He also had a rebuke for Mr Cameron over his attitude to environmental policies telling party activists: ""It's not green c*** to us"" as he made a manifesto pledge to five new green laws. The Prime Minister was reported last year to have said: ""We've got to get rid of all this green c***."" Mr Clegg also promised the vow on the devolution of powers to Scotland promised by the three party leaders would not be broken. He paid tribute to the two Britons killed by Islamic State terrorists, saying their deaths had provided British forces in Iraq with a ""clear, single objective"". He also announced there would be national waiting times for mental health patients and, like Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband, he pledged to increase spending on the like DNHS."

Experts suggest betting shops and discount stores gained increasing footholds at the expense of traditional retailers. While the recession has hit high street businesses hard, the changes have been put down to the rise of digital commerce. The collapse of Phones 4u has added to the overall rise in shop closures Matthew Hopkinson, director of the Local Data Company, told Sky News: ""Significant changes are continuing to take place across Britain's town centres. ""It reflects the reality that shops need to become experiential destinations. ""The transaction element is between people and not on product. ""The UK leads in terms of the impact online."" Town centres saw 406 net store closures compared to 209 in the same period last year, research from accountancy firm PwC, compiled by the Local Data Company, showed. The collapse of businesses such as Phones 4u and lingerie chain La Senza saw this rise to 964 for the year to date at the end of September - two-and-a-half times the number for the whole of 2013. There were 953 net closures in the first half of 2012 which reflects a closure rate of about 16 shops each day. Traditional goods retailers such as shoe and clothes shops saw a net decline of 365 in the first half while leisure chains - encompassing food, beverage and entertainment - grew outlets by a net 215. About 80% of the UK's national output comes from services, which includes retail, hospitality and financial industries. The figures showed the changing face of the high street with coffee outlets, banks, pound shops, charity shops and convenience stores on the rise, together with American-style eateries. Meanwhile, video libraries were wiped out, as were many mobile phone shops. Mark Hudson, retail leader at PwC, said: ""This data shows that we are now really starting to see the full effects of the digital revolution and consequent change in customer behaviour play out on the high street. ""We're heading for a high street based around immediate consumption of food, goods and services or distress or convenience purchases."""
2014-10-09,A school visit by a charity worker in Greater Manchester has been cancelled because some parents were reportedly worried their children would be infected by ebola.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20141009020101/http://news.sky.com/story/1349558/school-blocks-charity-worker-over-ebola-fears,"A school visit by a charity worker in Greater Manchester has been cancelled because some parents were reportedly worried their children would be infected by ebola. Miriam Mason-Sesay and her nine-year-old son, Kofi - who was due to study at St Simon's Catholic Primary School in Stockport - are from Sierra Leone. They have been screened, are healthy and have been given unrestricted movement in the UK. Kofi came with his mother from Sierra Leone on Thursday The school tried to reassure parents that they posed no risk but a number of parents were insistent the visit should not go ahead. In a statement, headteacher Elizabeth Inman said: ""A significant number of parents have been in touch with me to express their fears. ""Ebola cannot be spread as some parents have suggested. ""There are many parents who believe that the visit should have gone ahead and that we are contributing to misunderstandings by cancelling it. The charity worker has been living in Sierra Leone since 2000 ""The misguided hysteria emerging is extremely disappointing, distracting us from our core purpose of educating your children and is not an environment that I would wish a visitor to experience."" Speaking to Sky News, Ms Mason-Sesay said she and Kofi had come from Sierra Leone on Thursday evening for fund-raising purposes - something she does every March and October for the charity, EducAid, which was started by her brother and a friend who set up schools for children out there. The charity worker, who has been in the West African country since 2000, said she and her son had not had any contact with anyone with ebola while in Sierra Leone - or anyone who had been in contact with someone who had had it. ""Absolutely not,"" she insisted. ""That's the trouble really. There have been 600 deaths but we're talking about a population of six million, it's less than 0.1%. It's not hiding behind every bush. ""It's a very nasty disease but you have to go looking to get it. You have to be a health worker or a care worker for somebody who is seriously ill. ""It's disappointing that people would think I would endanger their children in that way and be going round other schools if I were a genuine risk."""

The infant, who has not been named by police, died last Friday after being attacked at an address in Daventry. The animal was put down at the scene. Investigators said they are looking into whether any offences had been committed. Under the Dangerous Dogs Act it is illegal to own, breed, sell or trade American pit bulls.

The leafy Tory seat of Warrington South has a reputation for being a political bellwether, having voted for the winning party in every election with the exception of one. But the rise of Nigel Farage has the candidates in the Cheshire seat fearing a result may be even closer. The current Conservative MP, David Mowat, accepts that UKIP could pull vital votes away from him in May 2015. Tory MP David Mowat talking to Sky News ""The electorate gave a message to the political classes that they need to be listened to and I agree with that,"" he said. ""But I don’t think UKIP would regard this as one of their target seats - they could do damage here and that could have unintended consequences."" The ""unintended consequences"", say the Conservatives, are that a vote for UKIP could allow Labour to make gains. The Labour candidate, Nick Bent, is hopeful: ""The rise of UKIP does worry me,"" he told Sky News. ""I am worried that there are still an awful lot of people floating along with UKIP. I think they will take more votes away from the Conservatives than they will from Labour and that could help us."" In the Mulberry Arms, UKIP's James Ashington - a lifelong Conservative councillor until he defected some years ago - sips from a small brandy glass and smiles. ""The idea that we're taking votes only from Conservatives is nonsense. We're taking large number of votes from Labour, too, and I think the same will happen in May,"" he said. ""I am not sure whether we will win here but I think we will do some damage to the other parties. ""People have very real concerns about jobs, immigration and the traditional parties."""

Ofgem said that between them, they made £2.8bn in profit last year, down 20% from £3.5bn in 2012. The fall is largely due to lower profits in generation, because of costs from the closure of previously profitable plants. Rachel Fletcher, senior partner for Ofgem's markets division, said: ""Our proposed reforms are providing increased transparency on company profits. ""This is important to inform public debate, encourage competition and to help suppliers rebuild customer trust."" The Ofgem figures also show that each customer paid an average bill of £1,225 last year. After wholesale and other costs are taken off, that works out at around £48 profit per customer - down from £53 profit for suppliers the previous year. Recent research from YouGov in partnership with provider SSE showed bill-payers believe suppliers make 26% profit - six times more than Ofgem figure. Since 2009, Ofgem has required the six large energy companies to produce annual statements showing the actual revenues, costs and profits of their generation and supply businesses."

The Oscar-winning actress was recognised in the Diplomatic Service and Overseas Birthday 2014 Honours list and received the honorary damehood (DCMG) for services to UK foreign policy and the campaign to end war-zone sexual violence. After the presentation, her husband Brad Pitt and their six children were presented to the Queen. The award was first announced in June as Jolie co-chaired the End Sexual Violence in Conflict (ESVC) global summit in London with then foreign secretary William Hague. At the time she said of the honour: ""To receive an honour related to foreign policy means a great deal to me, as it is what I wish to dedicate my working life to.

The Tomb Raider and Maleficent star's work as a committed humanitarian runs parallel to her career as a leading actress who has been a huge box office draw for more than a decade. US Secretary of State John Kerry praised her humanitarian efforts after news of the award in June, describing her as as a ""fierce and fearless advocate'' and he said her dedication to campaigning could overtake her successful film career as her lasting legacy. Jolie is also special envoy of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. The leading lady joins the ranks of many acting greats who have received damehoods, including Judi Dench, Julie Andrews, Angela Lansbury, Helen Mirren and Maggie Smith. The 39-year-old star has previously won an Academy Award, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, and three Golden Globe Awards, and was named Hollywood's highest-paid actress by Forbes in 2009, 2011, and 2013. The actress will not be able to call herself a Dame as she is an American citizen but can use the initials of the award after her name."

The 65-year-old had maintained his innocence since he was held on October 29 last year. He was arrested on the same day as another man, now aged 75, over alleged sex offences during a two-year period in the early 1980s. Baljit Ubhey, the Chief Crown Prosecutor of CPS London, said: ""Having carefully reviewed this case, we have decided that there is insufficient evidence to prosecute in relation to allegations of sexual offences made by two males believed to be aged between 14 and 15 at the time of the alleged offending. ""Each allegation was considered on its own merits and we have concluded that the available evidence does not offer a realistic prospect of conviction for any of the alleged offences. ""The complainants have been informed and we will be writing to them to more fully explain our decision and offer a meeting should they wish to discuss the matter in more detail."" At the time of his arrest, Gambaccini released a statement to say: ""On Monday night, October 28, I attended an excellent production of the Kander and Ebb musical, The Scottsboro Boys, at the Young Vic theatre. ""It concerned a group of black men in Alabama in the 1930s who were falsely accused of sexual offences. Within hours, I was arrested by Operation Yewtree. ""Nothing had changed, except this time there was no music."" After the announcement, Gambaccini's friends and colleagues expressed their relief. Broadcaster Liz Kershaw said: ""Delighted to hear my friend, mentor, music encyclopaedia and perfect gentleman #PaulGambaccini is a 'free man' after a whole year on bail."" Gambaccini and the second man were the 15th and 16th people to be arrested under Operation Yewtree, the national inquiry sparked by allegations against Jimmy Savile. Ten people, including Jim Davidson and Freddie Starr, have been told they will face no further action after being questioned as part of the investigation. Three have been convicted - performer Rolf Harris, PR expert Max Clifford and DJ Dave Lee Travis. Former pop star Gary Glitter and ex-radio DJ Chris Denning are due to face trial. Driver David Smith was charged but died before court proceedings could take place, and another man, aged 73, remains on bail after he was arrested in April."

2014-10-11,The Football Association is to take responsibility for publicly-owned pitches in up to 30 English cities as part of an attempt to revive the grassroots of the game.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20141011022105/http://news.sky.com/story/1350956/fa-plans-plastic-pitches-to-boost-grassroots,"By Paul Kelso, Sports Correspondent The Football Association is to take responsibility for publicly-owned pitches in up to 30 English cities as part of an attempt to revive the grassroots of the game. Under the plan, revealed by FA chairman Greg Dyke in Sheffield, the FA is aiming to raise up to £230m from the professional game, local authorities and government to double the number of full-size artificial pitches by 2020. The plan is intended to address the declining quality of local authority pitches, which, because of spending cuts, are seldom maintained to reasonable standards, while hire costs are rising as councils attempt to balance the books. Mr Dyke's solution to the grassroots problem is plastic pitches. The FA hopes artifical pitches will improve England's chances With thousands of matches scheduled for grass pitches lost every year to the weather, the FA will focus on building large numbers of artificial grass pitches (AGPs) that can be used all-year round. They will be focused on football ""hubs"" in up to 30 cities, starting with a pilot scheme in Sheffield and followed by similar schemes in Liverpool and Birmingham. ""We think we are behind in this country,"" Mr Dyke told Sky Sports News HQ at the launch in Sheffield. ""It needs to change. Local authorities are under enormous pressure. The great advantage of these artificial pitches is that you can play 80 hours a week. ""We have a big problem in grassroots football because of facilities. I wouldn't say it's at crisis point, but we have to do something about it."" He added: ""We are hoping the Government and local authorities will give us some money. We hope the Premier League and private sector will put some money in. ""The Premier League already puts money into facilities and we just hope they put some more in."" The proposals are the centrepiece of the second part of the FA Chairman's England Commission, set up last year to try to improve the long-term prospects for the England men's national team. Mr Dyke set up the commission because of concerns over the decline in the number and quality of English footballers at the highest level. Less than a third of players starting in Premier League teams are English, a decline that Mr Dyke believes has hampered the ability of the national team to compete. The report focuses on the pathway for children into the game, and specifically on the quality of facilities and coaching. The proposals for new pitches are ambitious, and could eventually see local authorities pass responsibility for pitches to local football trusts in which the FA, councils and local clubs could have a voice. In order to fund the scheme the FA want councils to put in money they would otherwise be spending on routine pitch maintenance as a lump sum, with the government and Premier League contributing significant sums. The FA want to increase the number of AGPs in urban areas by 130% to more than 500, and nationwide to more than 1,000. On coaching, the FA want to recruit huge numbers of qualified instructors, tripling the number of Level 3 coaches from 800 to more than 3,000, and increasing the number of advanced level coaches from 200 to 750. Sports Minister Helen Grant welcomed the scheme but stopped short of committing any funding. ""I am keen to see what more we can do to help further improve the nation's facility stock, putting 3G pitches in places that need them most, and I am continuing discussions with the football authorities on this front,"" she said. Government critics may argue that austerity measures have contributed to the decline in local authority spending on facilities."

2014-10-11,"One of China's biggest food companies is poised to take full control of Weetabix, the UK's second-biggest breakfast cereal producer, in a deal worth hundreds of millions of pounds.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20141011022105/http://news.sky.com/story/1350914/chinese-poised-to-snack-on-40-percent-weetabix-stake,"By Mark Kleinman, City Editor One of China's biggest food companies is poised to take full control of Weetabix, the UK's second-biggest breakfast cereal producer, in a deal worth hundreds of millions of pounds. Sky News understands that Bright Food, which bought a 60% shareholding in Weetabix in 2012, is preparing to acquire most of the 40% of the company it does not already own. If it proceeds, the transaction will hand full ownership of brands such as Alpen, Ready Brek and Weetos to Bright Food, underlining a growing trend of takeovers of prominent Western brands by Chinese companies. The majority of the remaining shares are held by Lion Capital, a private equity group, which took control of Weetabix a decade ago, ending seven decades of family ownership. As part of the deal that saw Bright Food become the cereal maker's majority investor, Lion and the Chinese company agreed put and call options allowing the transfer of the rest of the shares two years after the original deal completed. Although Bright Food's investment was announced in May 2012, it did not legally complete until November that year, meaning the window for the remainder of the takeover will open next month. Bankers said that Lion was likely to pursue the sale of its Weetabix shares shortly after that window opened, although they cautioned that it had not yet been formally agreed. Weetabix is one of the most popular food brands in the UK, having been founded in 1932 and subsequently expanding to more than 80 countries around the world. Run by Giles Turrell, its chief executive, the 2012 takeover by Bright Food valued Weetabix at £1.2bn. Employing around 1,800 people, the Northamptonshire-based company made a pre-tax profit of £68m in the last year for which results are available. Its backing from Bright Food has spurred plans for the launch of product variants such as green tea-flavoured Weetabix targeted at Chinese consumers for who breakfast cereals are not part of a conventional daily diet. Although the company is performing well, it told employees earlier this year that it planned to scrap a planned 2.5% pay rise amid a cost reduction drive triggered by pressure from supermarket own-brands and discount rivals. Bright Food and Lion have continued to work together on other prospective partnerships, exploring a £2bn bid for United Biscuits earlier this year before deciding not to proceed. One of the remaining bidders for UB is Kellogg, the US cereal producer which is Weetabix's only bigger competitor in the UK market. Weetabix and Lion Capital declined to comment."

Alice went missing from her home in Hanwell, west London, on 28 August. Just over a month later, her body was found hidden on the bed of the River Brent. The Metropolitan Police's Deputy Commissioner, Craig Mackey, has defended the amount of time it took to find her body, saying it was a ""colossal"" investigation. The body of the prime suspect, Arnis Zalkalns, was found in Boston Manor Park - a mile from where Alice's body was recovered - on October 4.

Jordan Brennan, 17, was found unresponsive in bed at his home in the Gorton area of the city on Saturday morning. He was pronounced dead at the scene by emergency services and a post-mortem examination later found he had died from a head injury. Police say he was assaulted by a man outside a grocer's shop in the area the evening before he died. CCTV of the pair, described as of Chinese appearance Police have launched a murder inquiry and have released CCTV images of a man and a woman they want to speak to about the incident at the shop. They say that around 7.30pm on Friday, Jordan was with two friends when they went into the store on Hyde Road. As Jordan was leaving he was assaulted outside the shop by a man who had also been in the shop at the same time as Jordan and his two friends. Jordan went home and went to bed and at 9am on Saturday and was found unresponsive by his mother. The man was wearing a white shirt, black jacket and trousers Detective Inspector Theresa Carter said: ""Jordan was very well known and liked and both his family and the wider community are deeply shocked and saddened by what happened. ""At this stage we know that Jordan was assaulted outside the grocer's store, but we don't know exactly what led up to the assault. ""I would also ask that the man involved contacts the police so that we can fully understand what happened inside and outside the shop. We would also like to speak to the woman who he was with."" The woman is thought to be around 25 to 30 years old Both the man and woman police wish to speak to are of Chinese appearance and about 25 to 30 years old. The man had a stocky or chubby build and black hair and was wearing a white shirt and a black suit jacket and trousers. The woman was slim and had long black straight hair. In a statement, Jordan's mother, Kim, said: ""Our son Jordan Brennan was 17 years old and was a well liked young man. ""He was a loveable rogue and was always polite and keen to help anyone who needed his help, be that physical help or just to listen to a friend. He would cheer them up with his usual larking about or joking around. ""He was a pleasure to have as a son and his loss is devastating. He was greatly loved by all that knew him."" :: Anyone with information is urged to call the police on 0161 856 68797 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
2014-10-13,"Jeremy Clarkson has been accused of ""fabricating"" his version of events after a Top Gear crew had to leave Argentina amid a row over a number plate which was interpreted by some as a reference to the Falklands War.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20141013111259/http://news.sky.com/story/1352021/clarkson-exaggerated-top-gear-number-plate-row,"Jeremy Clarkson has been accused of ""fabricating"" his version of events after a Top Gear crew had to leave Argentina amid a row over a number plate which was interpreted by some as a reference to the Falklands War. The country's ambassador to the United Kingdom, Alicia Castro, wrote in The Independent that the presenter had told an ""exaggerated story"". The BBC show's crew had to leave Argentina after trouble erupted when it emerged they were using a Porsche with the registration number H982 FKL, which some suggested could refer to the 1982 war between Britain and Argentina over control of the territory. Ms Castro: 'Clarkson's imperialistic imagination is remarkably fertile' Clarkson wrote in his Sunday Times column that he and his crew were attacked by an angry crowd armed with rocks and pickaxe handles, and he later told The Sun it was ""the most terrifying thing"" he had ever been involved in. An executive producer denied the number plate was a ""stunt"" and the BBC said it was a coincidence and had not been chosen deliberately. Ms Castro, referencing Clarkson's column, wrote: ""The presenter - in his column entitled 'Make no mistake, lives were at risk' - fabricates an exaggerated story. He describes being ambushed by a mob branding 'pickaxes'. ""Later, switching narrative style, he recounts another scene: Clarkson claims that a mob was trying to burn the crew's cars - which I understand did not actually happen - and he goes so far as to affirm that 'one said they were going to barbecue us and eat the meat'. ""Clarkson's imperialistic imagination is remarkably fertile: Argentina has never practised cannibalism. We do, it is true, eat a lot of beef. But we have never eaten a journalist."" Ms Castro said the crew were given safe passage across the border into Chile by the authorities when locals' anger threatened to boil over. But she said: ""As he ends a tale designed to portray Argentines as savages - and without acknowledging the security extended to him by the government of Tierra del Fuego - Clarkson reflects on what might have caused the protests. ""He reasons that the troubles were in no way linked to his provocative behaviour, but that they were in fact down to other causes: 'We were English', he concludes."" Earlier this week, Top Gear executive producer Andy Wilman said the presenters had bought the car in the UK because it was the best available vehicle of its kind and no one had noticed the number plate. Richard Hammond, another presenter on the show, has said the team ""felt a real chill"" when they realised the number plate could cause offence. Speaking on BBC Radio 2, Hammond said it would have been ""a terrible gag if we'd planned it - we wouldn't joke about soldiers, we simply wouldn't. That one was a genuine accident""."

Tania Clarence, 42, had pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Olivia, four, and three-year-old twins Ben and Max by diminished responsibility - but denied murder. Her plea was accepted at a hearing at the Old Bailey meaning she will no longer face trial next year. The court was told that in the light of medical reports, the Crown Prosecution Service accepted that Clarence was suffering from a ""major depressive episode"" at the time of the killings which amounted to an ""abnormality of mind"". Clarence, who was not in court, will be sentenced on 14 November when she is likely to face a hospital order. Jim Sturman QC, defending, said a hospital order would be a ""just and compassionate"" sentence. He said: ""This is a truly tragic case. Anybody who reads the evidence cannot fail to be moved. ""... [Clarence] was manifesting stress throughout the life of the children by their suffering and caring for three children with this condition was exhausting, distressing, debilitating and turned out to be overwhelming."" He said as a result of her illness Clarence had ""no hope for the future"" and her suicide attempt was genuine. Clarence's husband Gary was in court for the brief hearing. The investment banker was in his family's native South Africa when he heard about the deaths. At a previous hearing, the court heard that Clarence confessed to killing three of her children at her home in the wealthy south west London suburb of New Malden on 22 April. Clarence left three notes before allegedly smothering the children, who all had type 2 spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a life-limiting genetic condition which leaves children with little or no control of their movement. She then tried to kill herself by taking a drug overdose and slashing her wrists. The mother of four was discovered bleeding and crying by the children's distraught nanny and a neighbour. They arrived to find the home in darkness and at the bottom of the stairs discovered a note written in Afrikaans to husband Gary. The court heard how they found Mrs Clarence in a bedroom and she told ""them to go away, saying that it was too late"". Asked if she had taken anything, the court heard that Clarence replied: ""I took something yesterday, but it didn't work."" Police were called and the neighbour checked if anyone else was in the house. He opened the door into the children's bedroom and saw the twin boys dead, but was too shocked to continue his search of the house. The three children were pronounced dead at the scene when officers arrived. Clarence confessed to the triple killing to a female police officer at the scene, saying: ""I'm sorry. I'm sorry."" Asked why she was sorry, the tearful mother said: ""I killed them. I suffocated them."" Two other notes were found in the house. One discovered on top of a pile of clothes in the master bedroom read: ""Gary, I don't want to be saved please. I can't live with the horror of what I have done. I thought the pills would work, they didn't."" A third note was addressed to the nanny, described in court as ""a significant member of the family"". Its contents were not divulged. :: Anyone feeling emotionally distressed or suicidal can call Samaritans for help on 08457 90 90 90 or email jo@samaritans.org mailto:jo@samaritans.org"

Sally-Ann Grainger, 34, featured in an article asking for a donor to come forward in January. She went into renal failure after taking medication following a double lung transplant in 2009. Ms Grainger had to have dialysis treatment three times a week and described herself as ""barely existing"". Even though she was a complete stranger, 33-year-old Wesley Joyce, who spent time in jail for assault, donated his kidney in order to ""make a new start"". He was one of 10 people to come forward, but the only one who was a tissue and blood match. ""This was the perfect opportunity for me to give something back, as long as I matched,"" Mr Joyce told Sky News. ""It wasn't good enough that I said I'd do it, I needed to actually do this. ""I said to Sally's daughter that I thank her mum for giving me the opportunity to do this."" Wesley Joyce responded to a local newspaper plea by Sally-Ann Grainger Ms Grainger said her donor had become a close friend after giving her a future and the opportunity to see her two daughters grow up. ""I put an appeal out because I wanted to be able to spend as much time as possible with my girls while I'm healthy, and live longer than six years, hopefully,"" she said. ""I felt sick, overjoyed, overwhelmed - I can't pick out one word that describes my gratitude and thanks for what he's done for me. It's just amazing."" The kidney transplant took place on Friday at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham. The operation appears to have been a success and both patients are now trying to encourage more people to sign up to the organ donor register."

Dr Hanan Ashrawi, executive committee member of the PLO, told Sky News the Palestinian cause must be ""rescued"" to prevent jihadists using it to fuel radicalisation and further extremism in the region. In reference to the growing influence of groups like Islamic State, she said: ""The Palestinian question has always been appropriated by others, and I've always said we need to rescue it from being 'up for grabs' by those looking for a cause, or who are trying to borrow our constituency or our legitimacy. ""It is imperative we remove one core issue from the region that has constantly fed… and send a clear message to the whole region and the rest of the world that justice can prevail and that we can make peace."" The debate in the House of Commons has been tabled by MP Grahame Morris, chair of the Labour Friends of Palestine. ""Not only is statehood the inalienable right of the Palestinian people, but recognising Palestine will breathe new life into a peace process that is at an impasse,"" Mr Morris told Reuters. The Westminster vote will not be binding on the UK Government and is unlikely to change official policy, which states recognition of a Palestinian state must follow a bilateral negotiated process with Israel. However, Dr Ashrawi said it was nonetheless ""a very significant moment"". She said: ""It is the beginning of a process of genuine consideration of the historical responsibility of the British towards Palestine, dating back to 1917, and we believe this process of rectification has to start. ""It is about time … not just as a way of doing justice to Palestine and respecting international law, but as a way of trying to rescue the chances of peace, which are disappearing rapidly."" The debate comes after Sweden's new government said it intended to officially recognise Palestine, a move that has drawn a sharp rebuke from Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said such unilateral moves were ""contrary to agreements"". He said: ""An agreement will only be reached through negotiations which will ensure Israel's national interests, with the security of Israel's citizens foremost among them."" Among EU countries, Poland, Hungary and Slovakia have already recognised Palestine as a state. In 2012, 138 countries voted to give the Palestinians ""non-observer"" member status at the UN General Assembly, which is seen as de facto recognition of the sovereign state of Palestine. Britain was among 40 countries to abstain on the 2012 vote, which was opposed by Israel, the US, Canada, Czech Republic, Panama, Palau, Nauru, the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia."
2014-10-13,The headteachers and governors of failing schools will be able to be sacked under new proposals announced by David Cameron.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20141013111259/http://news.sky.com/story/1351896/pms-pledge-to-sack-failing-headteachers,"The headteachers and governors of failing schools will be able to be sacked under new proposals announced by David Cameron. The extra powers, which include measures to impose tough classroom discipline, are part of Conservative plans to rescue 500 failing English schools. A future Conservative government also plans to set up a crack squad of teachers who can be sent to classrooms that are not coming up to scratch. Mr Cameron wrote in the Daily Mail that he wants all youngsters to enjoy the same ""brilliant"" education his children do and said no children should endure ""second-rate"" schooling. Writing directly to parents, he said: ""Taking my four-year-old daughter Florence to school for the first time is something I won't forget. ""All parents know that feeling - the apprehension as you let go of your child's hand and watch them run across the playground towards their new friends. ""But what gave me peace of mind, what made it a little easier to walk away, was knowing that Florence is being taught at a brilliant state primary school. ""I want for your children what I have for my own, because no child in Britain should be born to have a second-rate education."" The Government's plans aim to tackle the time it takes to turn around badly performing schools. There have been concerns about the impact a delay can have on children's education. The Conservatives say that up to 100,000 youngsters would be able to receive a better education if their proposals are put in place. The so-called ""rescue package"", which will be put together with the help of experts, will be included in the party's general election manifesto. Department for Education processes have been under greater scrutiny after a number of problems in schools have hit the headlines. The Al Madinah School in Derby and the Discovery New School in Crawley, West Sussex, were both recently forced to close, and in Birmingham, the so-called ""Trojan Horse"" letter led Ofsted to issue a damning verdict on a number of the city's schools. Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said: ""I have announced that Labour will introduce new local Directors of School Standards to provide rigorous oversight of all state schools, spotting and acting on problems before it is too late. ""But ministers have refused to take action throughout the entirety of this Parliament. ""On the issue of teacher quality, the Government has changed the rules to allow unqualified teachers into the classroom. Labour will end this damaging policy, focusing on delivering highly qualified teachers in every classroom. ""Ministers are now trying to play catch-up but the public will see that it is this Government's damaging schools policy that has failed pupils."""

Mr Henning, 47, who was seized after taking aid to Syria, was remembered as ""a local, national and world hero"". His widow Barbara, children Adam and Lucy and other family members joined scores of well-wishers at the British Muslim Heritage Centre in Whalley Range, Manchester. The first of several faith and political leaders to speak, Dr Usman Choudhry said: ""In short we are here to remember a hero. A local hero, a national hero and we will also say a world hero. Barbara Henning receives a hug before the start of the memorial ""A hero who left the comfort of his own home for no other reason than to help the destitute and needy refugees of Syria. ""A hero who put the needs of others before his own and that hero is Alan Henning."" He added the memorial was aimed at supporting ""those willing to stand up for the rights of humanity and the poor and the repressed, and are prepared to work and not just talk about what they believe in"". The tribute, entitled His Life And Legacy Remembered, included speeches from friends of Mr Henning. One of those who travelled on the convoy with him, Majid Freeman, said: ""Alan was a beautiful genuine human being, inside and out. ""He went to Syria to help at a time when the whole international community had abandoned them. ""The international community leaders were paying mere lip service while Alan and many other aid workers were actually feeding these people, sheltering them, giving them aid, taking nappies for the babies, ambulances and generators for the hospitals, sweets and toys for the children and so much more."" Mr Freeman recalled how on when the convoy stopped off en route in Venice, Mr Henning had chosen to sleep in his ambulance rather than in a hotel to save the money for people in Syria. His friend and fellow convoy volunteer, Dr Shameela Islam-Fulfiqar, said: ""Alan Henning did what most of us just think about. He sacrificed his time, his energy, his home comforts to help people who were suffering and he paid the ultimate price for this."" The audience also watched a video tribute in which several Syrian children who Mr Henning helped said how much they missed the aid volunteer, who they called ""Uncle Gadget"". Last Sunday, Mrs Henning and her family took part in a service of ""reflection and solidarity"" at Eccles Parish Church in Salford. Mr Henning was beheaded by IS who posted a video showing his death on the internet last week. He had previously been kidnapped by militants last December in Syria. At the time, Mr Henning, from Eccles, was part of a convoy who were delivering food and supplies to refugees."

2014-10-13,Hundreds of thousands of health workers have staged a strike in protest at the Government's decision not to give them a 1% pay rise.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20141013111259/http://news.sky.com/story/1351884/midwives-among-400000-striking-health-workers,"Hundreds of thousands of health workers have staged a strike in protest at the Government's decision not to give them a 1% pay rise. Midwives, nurses, paramedics, ambulance staff, and hospital porters and cleaners mounted picket lines across England from 7am for four hours, while action will be taken later today in Northern Ireland. It was the biggest strike of its kind for over 30 years involving 400,000 NHS staff and several trade unions, including the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) for the first time in the organisation's 133-year history. Contingency plans were worked out, and union members dealt with emergencies. NHS bosses postponed non-emergency appointments during the strike but emergencies would not be ignored. Ambulance service providers had warned they may be forced to prioritise their care and brought in extra staff from the military to fill in the gaps. Unions were protesting at the Government's decision not to accept the independent pay review body's recommendation to award a 1% pay rise to all staff. Instead, ministers took the decision to award a 1% pay rise for those on top of their pay band but not to those on ""progression pay increase"", who automatically get a fixed average pay increase of 3%. The unions say the number of NHS England health workers who will not benefit from the additional 1% is around 600,000. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt defended the Government's stance: ""Everyone is going to get the 1% but what we have said is we can’t afford to give the 1% to the people who are already getting an increase of 3% through their increment. "" …The reason is very simple: we have analysis that shows if we did that hospitals would lay off around 4,000 nurses next year and 10,000 nurses the year after and that would be bad for nurses and of course very bad for patients,"" he said. Unions said there had been ""tremendous"" support for the strike across the country and that it was the right thing to do. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady, who joined a picket line near Euston in London, said: ""NHS staff are always reluctant strikers - there hasn't been a national strike over pay in the health service since 1982 - and they will do everything they can to protect patients in their care. But morale has hit rock-bottom."" Unison general secretary Dave Prentis told Sky News that despite ministers ""glorying"" that Britain was now out of recession his members were ""getting nothing"". ""They are being screwed and screwed and screwed again while the rich in our society make a killing from the growth in the economy,"" he added. As they marched, midwives shouted: ""Don't push midwives - push fair pay."" They said they never imagined having to go on strike but were at their wits' end. Annie Black, who has been a midwife for 12 years, said: ""We haven't had a pay rise for years yet our workload keeps on increasing. It's time the Government took us seriously. It's weird being on strike, but we feel that enough is enough."" Cathy Warwick, chief executive of the RCM, added: ""Midwives are caring people who often work long hours of unpaid overtime just to keep our understaffed, under-resourced maternity services running in the midst of a decade-long baby boom. ""They deserve this modest 1% pay rise."" The average annual private sector pay increase is currently around 2.5%, while last year it was recommended that MPs should see their pay increase by 11% by 2015."

Douglas Carswell was back at Westminster - after defecting from the Conservatives in August - as a UKIP MP following victory in the Clacton by-election last week. The win, and a close second for UKIP in the Heywood and Middleton by-election on the same day, saw the party surge to 25% in opinion polls. Douglas Carswell and Nigel Farage campaign with Mark Reckless in Rochester MPs flooded into the chamber to see Mr Carswell sworn in. There were a few laughs when he greeted Tory MP Michael Gove on his way past the front bench to take his oath to the Queen. He then shared a few words with Speaker of the House John Bercow. Nigel Farage meanwhile has said UKIP could prop up a minority Conservative government after the general election, offering support in return for a 2015 referendum on EU membership. David Cameron has promised to try to thrash out a new deal with Europe and then put membership to the vote in 2017. In an apparent attempt to stave off the UKIP attack, Boris Johnson used his newspaper column in The Daily Telegraph on Monday to suggest Britain should be ready. The London Mayor, who would be the primary challenger to Mr Cameron in the event of a leadership contest, also called for the introduction of a quota system, which has been suggested by UKIP. He said: ""It would be madness to close our borders to talent; but it is also madness to continue with a system that means we have no idea how many are coming or what burdens they may place on the state. ""Only David Cameron can conceivably deliver those changes, since he is the only leader who can lead reform of the EU. That is the point I hope the kippers [UKIP] will recognise in May next year. And the rest of us should recognise, in turn, that the kippers aren't wicked. They don't hate immigrants; they just hate the lack of control of immigration."" Both Mr Cameron and Ed Miliband are under pressure over the rise of Mr Farage's party, as experts claim the poll surge could see UKIP win as many as 128 seats at the General Election. Labour backbenchers have already called for Mr Miliband to go to give the party a greater chance in the May vote and there have been suggestions a Labour MP could be about to defect to UKIP. There have also been suggestions among Conservatives of a vote of no confidence in Mr Cameron if the party loses to UKIP again at the Rochester and Strood by-election next month. It is widely expected Mark Reckless, who defected from the Tories in September triggering the vote, will hold on to his seat. Speaking on Sunday Mr Farage offered a coalition deal with the Conservatives which would see UKIP support the Tories on the Budget and in any ""no confidence"" votes but not have ministers. In return he would want a referendum on EU membership in 2015. He told BBC's Sunday Politics: ""The price would be a full, free and fair referendum on our continued membership of the European Union. Sometime next July strikes me as a good time to do this."" Mr Cameron has previously ruled out a UKIP pact and has banned Conservative MPs from striking deals locally which might see parties campaigning on a joint ticket or for mutual benefit. However, there are suggestions a number of Tories are poised to ignore the edict. Speaking on Sunday, Mr Carswell urged UKIP to ""keep a sense of perspective"" and said the party was a long way off a majority."

Finnigan was making her debut on chat show Loose Women when she said the rape committed by the sportsman was ""not violent"" and did not cause ""bodily harm"". The presenters were discussing Evans' case following reports that he could return to Sheffield United after serving half of a five-year sentence for raping a woman in a hotel room. Finnigan, who is married to presenter Richard Madeley, said: ""If he does go back, he will have to brave an awful lot of comments obviously from the fans who are there. ""But, having said that, he has served his time, he's served two years. The rape - and I am not, please, by any means minimising any kind of rape - but the rape was not violent, he didn't cause any bodily harm to the person. Evans is due to be released soon ""It was unpleasant, in a hotel room I believe, and she had far too much to drink. ""That is reprehensible, but he has been convicted and he has served his time. When he comes out, what are we supposed to do, just actually to refuse to let him do his job even though he's already been punished?"" The former This Morning presenter's comments sparked a backlash among viewers who voiced their anger on Twitter. Finnigan later issued a statement, saying: ""I apologise unreservedly for any offence that I may have caused as a result of the wording I used. ""I absolutely wasn't suggesting that rape was anything other than an horrendous crime and, as I said on the programme, I was in no way attempting to minimise the terrible ordeal that any woman suffers as a result. ""The point I was attempting to raise as part of the debate was what should happen to someone after they have committed a crime and served their time?"" In August, an online petition was launched urging Sheffield United not to re-employ the disgraced footballer. This now has more than 142,000 signatures. His girlfriend Natasha Massey has stood by him through his trial and prison sentence and has visited him every week. She says she still believes Evans is innocent but does not know what he will do once he has been released."

Erol Incedal, who is accused of preparing acts of terrorism and possessing a document called how to make a bomb on a memory card, was arrested in September last year, the court heard. His black Mercedes was searched and the jury was told a number of significant items were found including a piece of paper with the address of a home owned by Mr Blair and his wife, Cherie, written on it. The paper was found inside a Versace sunglasses case, the jury heard, and during the search of the car it was bugged by officers. The prosecution told the jury it was not clear 26-year-old Incedal had set out a specific target but that he may have been intending to launch either a Mumbai-style attack or to hit a high-profile individual. Prosecutor Richard Whittam QC told the court: ""Count 1 does not suggest that Erol Incedal had settled on a specific target or a particular methodology but in the context of the case as a whole and the evidence that I am going to come to, you may think that this address does have some significance."" The address of a home owned by the Blairs was found in Incedal's car He added: ""You will hear that he was actively engaged with another or others who were abroad. The prosecution case is that such engagement was for an act, or acts of terrorism, either against a limited number of individuals of significance, or a more wide-ranging, an indiscriminate attack such as the one in Mumbai."" In 2008 Pakistani terrorists launched co-ordinated bombing and shooting attacks at venues across Mumbai lasting four days and killing 164 people. The case is the first major terror trial to be heard almost entirely in secret, with only a few journalists admitted but unable to report on the proceedings on the grounds of national security. Parts of the trial will be heard in public after newspapers and campaign groups fought a court ruling it should be held completely in secret, however, the majority of it will still be held behind closed doors. Speaking ahead of the trial, the judge told the jury they must set their emotions aside and decide on their verdicts in a ""cool and dispassionate"" way. Incedal denies the charges against him."

Memuna Janneh, who was brought up in the West African country and continues to do business there, has set up the charity lunchboxgift.com to supply fresh, cooked meals for communities left in crisis by the spread of the disease. She told Sky News: ""It's just a horror story for me. ""These are streets I used to play in, these are houses that I visited as a child, so it's very real to me and you just watch the programmes and you hope you don't see somebody that you know, you just worry this is coming closer every time."" Earlier this year, while in Sierra Leone, she was concerned to see areas being locked down to stop the spread of the virus. Memuna Janneh was brought up in Sierra Leone She said she was especially worried about the consequences of the lockdown for those who go out on a daily basis to find their meals. Ms Janneh quickly gathered a team together to supply 2,600 meals to those living in seven communities. She is now hoping to raise enough money to supply 50,000 meals to hospitals, orphanages and quarantine zones. She said: ""This is just something that we can do. As citizens, as Sierra Leonians, as Africans, as people of the world. ""This is something we can handle without waiting for the big organisations, this is something ordinary citizens can come together and handle."" She hopes that by taking control of something as simple as food, the authorities can be freed up to deal with medical issues."

Sky News has learnt that Leo Quinn is to become the new boss of Balfour Beatty just weeks after it called off takeover talks with rival Carillion. Mr Quinn, who has been at Qinetiq since November 2009, was formerly the chief executive of De La Rue, the banknote printer, and is respected by City investors. His appointment is a coup for Balfour Beatty, which has been left reeling by five profit warnings in less than two years and a row with some investors about the sale of its US operation, Parsons Brinckerhoff. Balfour Beatty is the UK's biggest construction group, but its shares have fallen sharply in the wake of its poor performance. Many shareholders backed the idea of a merger with Carillion but negotiations between the two companies soured, ending without agreement. Some analysts believe Carillion will return next year with a fresh proposal but Mr Quinn's appointment may persuade shareholders to give Balfour Beatty the benefit of the doubt. Steve Marshall, its executive chairman, has said he will make way for a successor once a new chief executive is installed. It was unclear on Tuesday night whether Qinetiq, which was spun out of the Ministry of Defence a decade ago, would announce Mr Quinn's replacement immediately. Balfour Beatty and Qinetiq declined to comment."

2014-10-15,"Labour will not take part in cross-party talks on English votes for English laws because it considers the plan to be a ""political stitch up"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20141015041109/http://news.sky.com/story/1352886/labour-accuses-tories-over-english-votes-plan,"By Anushka Asthana, Political Correspondent Labour will not take part in cross-party talks on English votes for English laws because it considers the plan to be a ""political stitch up"". A senior source in Ed Miliband's party has told Sky News that he believes the plans, led by Conservative minister William Hague, are designed to put the ""Conservative interests"" ahead of the national interest. He said that Labour would put forward an alternative plan for giving UK regions greater powers over how they are run in a ""constitutional convention"". The comments came as the parties clashed in the House of Commons over the politically divisive issue in the wake of the Scottish referendum. Following the No vote on independence, David Cameron promised he would come good on a ""vow"" made with Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband to Scottish voters that the country's Parliament would be given greater powers. However, after pressure from Conservative MPs, the Prime Minister also said he would look at the West Lothian Question, which gives Scottish MPs the right to vote on English matters but denies English MPs the right to vote on matters controlled by Holyrood. Mr Cameron appointed Mr Hague to look at the issue and consider handing further powers to the rest of the UK. In a parliamentary debate, Mr Hague pleased Conservative colleagues by saying that the time had come to address the issue of English votes for English laws. However, he argued that there was no appetite for the issue of giving more power to the regions favoured by Labour. Labour has a large number of MPs in Scotland and could face a situation in which it has a UK-wide majority but is not ahead in England because those Scottish MPs are unable to vote on English matters, hampering the party's ability to govern.  Tory MPs know that the reform could put them in a stronger situation so have been pushing hard for it.  The Labour source told Sky News: ""David Cameron had a political problem at 7am on the morning after the referendum."" He argued that Mr Hague's pledge to set up a committee to consider English votes for English laws was his ""way of getting out of it"". ""We don't think that an ill thought through political stitch-up is the way to proceed [when it comes to] the constitutional future of the country."" Mr Hague said the English constitutional matter had to be dealt with, although he insisted that the Scottish “vow” would be fulfilled regardless. The SNP has criticised the Government since the referendum, claiming they are trying to back down on their pledge. They seized on the language included in a command paper published on Scottish devolution on Monday. The SNP MP Pete Wishart said: ""Scotland was told in the 'vow' that extensive new powers will be delivered for our Parliament, but this core promise is nowhere to be seen in [Monday's] paper."""

2014-10-15,"People often say ""the clue's in the title"". Smug, pompous people attempting to make me look stupid, mostly.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20141015041109/http://news.sky.com/story/1353039/evel-dominates-devolution-debate-in-commons,"People often say ""the clue's in the title"". Smug, pompous people attempting to make me look stupid, mostly. But they generally have a point. So what to make of a session of the Commons described as a ""General debate on devolution following the Scotland Referendum""? A forensic examination of the Command Paper, published on Monday, outlining the parties' proposals for extra powers to the Scottish Parliament, perhaps? Maybe a chinwag about the failure of Scottish devolution to put an end to all that pesky independence talk? Surely, at the very least, a ""general debate"" on where the UK currently stands, having come so close to splitting? In the end, it took mere seconds of the opening speech by William Hague to see that this was to be none of those. The Leader of the House told MPs that any new settlement for Scotland demanded a ""balanced settlement"" for the rest of the UK. ""Fairness for England"" was now demanded, an end to the debate over the West Lothian Question. English votes for English laws, or EVEL as it has amusingly become known (well, amusing to those of us with a penchant for jumping bikes over buses), came to dominate. You could sense SNP indignation mounting. The Two Anguses, Robertson and MacNeil, separately interrupted the EVEL overlord, asking why this was now the topic for discussion. ""It says Scotland on the annunciator!"", said Mr MacNeil, waving at the screens hanging above the chamber. Sadiq Khan followed for Labour. He, too, was interrupted by Nationalists pointing out that he had yet to mention Scotland. Indeed, the majority of what followed was a substantive discussion of how to resolve the issue of Scottish MPs voting on issues devolved to Scotland. Also, plenty from aggrieved Labour MPs keen to resist changes affecting their Westminster vote. But precious little directly about Scotland. That was unsurprising. After all, it was David Cameron who said that granting Scotland more devolution in fact demanded the long-standing issue be solved. Yet, whether by accident or design, the PM only linked extra powers for Holyrood to EVEL the day after Scotland voted no. And he did so to some fairly virulent criticism - much coming from those who had followed his advice, taken him at his word, and voted no on the promise of a beefed-up Scottish Parliament. This was never intended to be a debate solely on Scottish devolution. After all, they can't yet agree on what should be dished out. Yet next time, maybe change the name of the debate? The people of Scotland lived and breathed the referendum for two years. The majority of the rest of the UK, perhaps two weeks. Tops.  Scotland watched as within hours of voting No the PM switched focus from answering the Scottish question, to answering an English one. And it watched again today as time and again the SNP tried to remind MPs why they were having the discussion in the first place. The clock is ticking on Westminster’s solemn vow for more powers."
2014-10-15,"Almost 10 million people a year are receiving NHS treatment because of alcohol, according to new figures.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20141015041109/http://news.sky.com/story/1353156/nhs-alcohol-related-admissions-near-10-million,"By Frazer Maude, North Of England Correspondent Almost 10 million people a year are receiving NHS treatment because of alcohol, according to new figures. The report compiled by Alcohol Concern shows the number and cost of treatments for illness and injury caused directly by drinking, like binge-fuelled trips to A&E or liver disease. It also shows the cost of conditions in which alcohol is a significant factor. A new online map highlights the total number of alcohol-related NHS admissions hit almost 10 million in England during 2012-13. While A&E admissions accounted for six in every 10 alcohol-related hospital visits, inpatient admissions were responsible for almost two thirds of the total cost burden. In England as a whole the figures suggest that drinking is attributable for almost half of all head and neck cancer inpatient admissions at a cost to the NHS of £65.3m. A&E admissions accounted for six in every 10 alcohol-related visits Just over 13% of all malignant breast neoplasm admissions were attributable to alcohol, costing the NHS £27.1m. In total 9.6 million people in England are now drinking in excess of Government guidelines, with 2.4 million of those classed as high risk. Gallery: Men & Women: Alcohol Guidance Women's bodies, in general, process alcohol at a slower rate than men's, says Drink Aware Alcohol can affect women's fertility, create a greater risk of breast cancer and increase some side-effects of the menopause The NHS estimates that around 4% of UK women show signs of alcoholism Alcohol daily guidelines for women are 2-3 units of alcohol, equivalent to a 175 ml glass of wine Alcohol daily guidelines for men are no more than of 3-4 units of alcohol, equivalent to a pint and a half of 4% beer Commenting on the data, Alcohol Concern Chief Executive Jackie Ballard said: ""The NHS is now facing an intolerable strain from alcohol-related illnesses. ""We need to ensure adequate alcohol care pathways are prioritised and appropriate services are put in place to ease this burden."" Dr Carsten Grimm, Clinical Lead for the Alcohol Service in Kirklees, Yorkshire, said: ""It is vital that people understand the full consequences of drinking at unsafe levels can have on their health. ""With almost 10 million alcohol-related hospital admissions, we can see just how serious an impact unsafe levels of alcohol consumption is having on our health system."" A Department of Health statement said the Government is well aware of the costs caused by drinking. ""We know that alcohol-fuelled harm costs society about £21bn a year and are determined to reduce this burden to taxpayers. The rise in admissions is very concerning and we are taking action to tackle cheap and harmful alcohol. ""We have given local authorities £8.2m over three years to tackle health issues in their communities like harmful drinking. ""We are working with industry to promote drinking within recommended guidelines and responsible drinking through local schemes, and are already making headway by removing a billion units from the market over four years."""
2014-10-15,People reaching the age of 55 are to be given more flexibility over what they can do with their pension pots as they approach retirement.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20141015041109/http://news.sky.com/story/1352515/over-55s-to-use-pension-pots-like-bank-accounts,"People reaching the age of 55 are to be given more flexibility over what they can do with their pension pots as they approach retirement. Chancellor George Osborne will announce today that the over-55s will be able to withdraw several lump sums instead of just one. The move is part of an ongoing restructuring of pensions, which the government wants to move away from the traditional annuities-only system. Some of the changes that will be in the Pension Tax Bill were announced in the Budget, but the Chancellor is now unveiling more proposals. From April individuals approaching retirement and pensioners will be able to take a series of lump sums, rather than being forced to withdraw all their money in one go. The changes raise the prospect that pensioners could fund their retirement by using their pension pots almost as bank accounts or by investing in other assets like property or shares. Until now, people who retired were only able to take 25% of their pension as a tax free lump sum in cash in one go. The rest had to be spent on a product like an annuity. Now, pensioners will be able to take multiple lump sums, with a quarter of each withdrawal tax free. The remaining 75% of each withdrawal will be taxed at whatever rate they are required to pay based on their annual income. The government is also planning to do away with the taxation of any pension contributions that have been unused and a person wants to pass on to their relatives. Previously any inheritance of unallocated pension funds was taxed at 55%. Mr Osborne said: ""People who have worked hard and saved all their lives should be free to choose what they do with their money, and that freedom is central to our long term economic plan. ""From next year they'll be able to access as much or as little of their defined contribution pension as they want and pass on their hard-earned pensions to their families tax free. ""For some people an annuity will be the right choice whereas others might want to take their whole tax free lump sum and convert the rest to drawdown. ""We've extended the choices even further by offering people the option of taking a number of smaller lump sums, instead of one single big lump sum."" Pensions campaigner Ros Altmann said: ""The Government's changes have the potential to help millions of pension savers make better use of their pension funds. ""Being free to access their money freely as they need to, rather than being forced to buy particular products will be very popular."" The Government announced earlier this year that around 320,000 people would get the freedom to access pension pots flexibly without suffering punitive tax rates."

Mark Rowley - the UK's National Policing Lead for Counter Terrorism - said officers were dealing with ""exceptionally high"" numbers of investigations and had been contacted by ""dozens"" of families concerned that loved ones may be planning to join jihadists in Syria or Iraq. Amid widespread fears over the influence of Islamic State terrorists, he revealed police have been taking down more than 1,000 pieces of extremist material from the internet each week, including videos of beheadings, torture and suicides. UK alert levels explained It comes as the Foreign Secretary said British fighters returning from Syria or Iraq could be tried for treason. Britons travelling to the Middle East had ""sworn personal allegiance"" to Islamic State (IS) and could potentially have committed treason, Mr Hammond told MPs on Thursday. ""There are a number of offences under English law with which returning foreign fighters can be charged,"" Mr Hammond said. ""We have had a discussion about the allegiance question. We've seen situations of people declaring that they have sworn personal allegiance to the so-called Islamic State and that does raise questions about their loyalty and allegiance to this country."" Scotland Yard Assistant Commissioner Rowley said: ""So far this year we have made 218 arrests and are running exceptionally high numbers of counter-terrorism investigations, the likes of which we have not seen for several years. ""Against an increasing operational tempo we are disrupting several attack plots a year. ""These plots are of varied sophistication, from individuals planning to carry out spontaneous yet deadly attacks to more complex conspiracies, almost all seemingly are either directed by or inspired by terrorism overseas."" Asst Comm Rowley said 16 people had been charged with terrorist offences after returning to the UK from Syria. He added: ""The volume, range and pace of counter-terrorism activity has undergone a step-change. ""Public safety is our number one priority and we will always focus our disruption activity against those posing the greatest and most imminent threat. ""Sometimes this means intervening very early - essential to prevent attacks, but presenting enormous challenges in securing sufficient evidence to charge."" He added that more than 80% of the material removed from the internet was related to Iraq and Syria, where the success of Islamic State has prompted fears the group's influence may be growing abroad. Asst Comm Rowley said 66 people who have been reported missing to police are feared to have travelled to Syria. ""The growing problem of young, impressionable, and in some cases vulnerable individuals being radicalised online is an increasing risk,"" he said.

Chris Vowles was with friends in the back garden of a house in Kitts Green, Birmingham, when he targeted the helicopter on 31 July. The crew were left disorientated as they were hit by the beam several times as they prepared for a surveillance mission. Using thermal imaging cameras, they picked out Vowles as he laughed and toasted the prank with friends. The group could be seen gesturing toward the helicopter and raising their beer bottles. Police on the ground were sent to their location and the 23-year-old shop worker, from Sandwell, was arrested on suspicion of acting recklessly in a manner likely to endanger an aircraft. Thermal imaging cameras picked out Vowles at a party with friends Footage from the helicopter showed Vowles attempt to the throw the laser pen over a fence. He was sentenced at Birmingham Crown Court to seven months in prison, suspended for two years. He was also ordered to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work, and pay a £100 victim surcharge and £300 court costs. Martin Knowles, West Midlands region National Police Air Service (NPAS) manager, said it was a deliberate act. He said: ""The demeanour of the people in the garden illustrates the attitude of many people - laughing and joking and believing their actions were somehow harmless fun. ""But aiming a laser pen at any aircraft, be it a police helicopter, air ambulance or commercial plane, can have disastrous consequences - it's certainly no laughing matter."" NPAS pilot Andy Shanks said he had been targeted ""countless"" times by laser pens during his 33-year flying career. He said: ""It's disorientating, makes it impossible to focus on the instrument panel and is extremely dangerous as even a momentary loss of control can be crucial. ""In a worst case scenario crew members struck in the eye can suffer eye damage - that happened recently to an observation officer in Ripley who suffered retina damage after being hit with the laser whilst looking through binoculars."""
2014-10-17,Vinyl album sales are flourishing as figures show they could pass the million mark by the end of the year - the best return for almost 20 years.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20141017055308/http://news.sky.com/story/1354770/vinyl-albums-a-hit-again-with-record-sales,"Vinyl album sales are flourishing as figures show they could pass the million mark by the end of the year - the best return for almost 20 years. The Official Charts Company figures show almost 800,000 vinyl albums have been sold in the first nine months of this year - already beating last year's total of 780,674. The last time vinyl topped a million sales was in 1996 when they shifted 1,083,206 albums. A spokesman for music industry body the BPI said: ""Vinyl may once have been considered a by-product of a bygone era but it is now well and truly a flourishing format making a come-back in a digital age. ""In an increasingly-digitised world, it appears that music fans still crave a tangible product that gives them original artwork, high audio quality, and purity of sound. ""Vinyl enthusiasts are now able to enjoy the renaissance of the format with a string of releases being made available on the format from emerging and established acts."" September was the busiest month of the year so far with 112,000 vinyl albums sold. And last year's biggest seller - AM by Arctic Monkeys - is continuing to top the charts for 2014, ahead of Jack White's Lazaretto. Vinyl albums hit an all-time low in 2007 with only 205,000 copies. In 2008 the vinyl revival began and the tally has continued to nudge upwards. So far this year, 112 releases have sold in excess of 1,000 copies, more than double the 50 which had done so in the first nine months of last year. Only one of the top 10 vinyl albums for this year was actually released for the first time in 2014 - the self-titled debut album by Royal Blood."

Sgt Stephen Brown pursued the man after he attacked a woman as she was getting out of a cab on a night out in Islington, north London, on Christmas Eve 2012. He managed to CS spray the knifeman's face before hitting his arm with an extendable baton and jumping on him as he fell - allowing colleagues to help arrest him. Home Secretary Theresa May said: ""The actions of Sergeant Stephen Brown are a powerful reminder of the commitment and courage that police officers bring to their role. ""Sergeant Brown put his own life in danger to defuse a terrifying situation. His intervention protected the public and may well have saved the lives of others."" Stephen was among 65 nominees from 31 forces singled out for valiant acts of bravery.  All were invited to Downing Street for a reception with Prime Minister David Cameron, who passed on his personal congratulations and thanks. The chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, Steve White, said: ""I am constantly humbled and amazed by the selfless acts of bravery carried out by police officers on a day-to-day basis. ""For every act of courage and bravery recognised in the Police Bravery Awards there are hundreds more that occur in our communities every day that go unrecognised."" A total of eight awards were made to officers from different parts of the country, including Sgt Brown. :: South West PC Luke Gribble from Avon and Somerset Police won his accolade for wading 100ft through rising flood waters in the dark to save a woman from her stranded car.  :: Southern Constables Keith Lucas and Shane Robinson from Essex Police helped save the life of a man who doused himself in petrol and set himself alight on a petrol station forecourt. :: North East Sgt Christopher Foster from South Yorkshire Police confronted an attacker who was viciously beating a man with a stick. :: Eastern Constables Rebecca Gardiner and Paul Osmond from Suffolk Police risked their lives to restrain a drunk driver who was stabbing himself in the stomach with kitchen knife. :: North West Constables Glenn Myerscough, Andrew MacFarlane and Kevin Latham from Cumbria Police were commended for bravery for tackling a drunken gang armed with a loaded gun and a knife. :: Wales PC John Harrison and Sgt Gareth Davies from North Wales Police arrested an armed man who had barricaded himself inside a conference room of the Guildhall in Wrexham, claiming to have a bomb.  :: Midlands PC Roger French from Staffordshire Police saved two lives when he braved a burning building three times, nearly being overcome by acrid smoke."

His comments came as visited Rochester, where the Conservatives are under pressure to see off the UKIP surge at a by-election next month triggered by the defection of MP Mark Reckless. The Prime Minister is said to be considering an ""emergency brake"" on immigration, which would be pulled when the number of jobseekers from particular EU countries reaches a certain level. Mark Reckless is running for UKIP in Rochester Mr Cameron said: ""We need further action to make sure we have more effective control of migration. We should have one last go at negotiating a better deal."" He added: ""I think we need to be clear that the immigration system hasn't been working properly. Greater control is required, but fairness should be at the heart of it. ""People recognise that Britain is an open, tolerant country, but immigration in recent years has been too high."" His comments seem to suggest that if tougher policies on immigration are not accepted in Brussels then he will be prepared to campaign to leave the European Union in the promised referendum in 2017. The Prime Minister has so far announced benefit curbs for those from new EU countries but now Number 10 is understood to be drawing up tougher policy to take to the EU. There are suggestions Mr Cameron could make an announcement on new measures ahead of the Rochester and Strood by-election on 20 November. However, there is also speculation he could hold off to just before Christmas so he has a sweetener to offer should the Conservatives lose the by-election to Mark Reckless, who defected to UKIP in September. Mr Cameron raised the prospect of new tough measures in his conference speech. He said he would put changes ""will be at the very heart of my renegotiation strategy for Europe"". He added: ""Britain, I know you want this sorted so I will go to Brussels, I will not take no for an answer and when it comes to free movement - I will get what Britain needs."" It comes after London Mayor Boris Johnson, who will be making his bid to return to Westminster as an MP at the General Election, called for the introduction of a quota system for EU migrants. Writing in The Daily Telegraph on Monday, Mr Johnson, a potential Tory party leadership contender, said: ""The voters aren't fools. They have spotted the incoherence - and what they object to is not so much the immigrants themselves; what makes people angry is the sense that the whole thing is out of control. ""Britain is now the America of the EU; the place people want to come; the magnet for the hordes at Calais. ""It is only reasonable for us to have some kind of further protections - involving points or even quotas, agreed with business - so we can manage that pressure."" Asked about the plans, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg accused the Conservatives of ""running after UKIP"". Other senior Tories are known to favour a points entry system like the one used in Australia, and the one suggested should be UK policy by UKIP. At Prime Minister’s Questions on Wednesday, Mr Cameron suggested immigration would be one of his ""red lines"" when negotiating a new deal with the European Union. A Number 10 spokesman said: ""Immigration is something that needs to be addressed as part of EU reform."""
2014-10-17,"The number of rapes is now at its highest ever level with a 48% rise in the number of the sex attacks at knifepoint, police figures show.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20141017055308/http://news.sky.com/story/1354312/rape-at-a-record-level-police-figures-show,"The number of rapes is now at its highest ever level with a 48% rise in the number of the sex attacks at knifepoint, police figures show. There were 22,116 rapes recorded by police in England and Wales in the year to June - a 29% rise - while all sexual offences showed an increase of 22%. One of the largest increases in the number of sex crimes recorded by officers was in South Yorkshire, which saw an 80% surge. The highest was Durham. The South Yorkshire force is still trying to cope with the fall-out from revelations that gangs of men groomed and sexually assaulted as many as 1,400 vulnerable children in Rotherham. It followed the Rochdale case where a group of Asian men were jailed for using 47 girls as sex slaves. Race hate crime increased in the wake of the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby Officials at the Office for National Statistics said the rise could be because victims were more willing to report sex crime. In addition, police recording practices had improved. There had been a number of claims to Government committees that officers had been massaging figures. There have been significant concerns over the rise of “rape culture” on social media and threats on Twitter and Facebook to sexually assault women have become commonplace. A Centre for Social Justice report out earlier this year found that young girls were increasingly being drawn into a gang culture where ""rape is used as a weapon”. The national policing lead for crime statistics, Chief Constable Jeff Farrar, said: ""It's reassuring to see increased reporting of sexual offences, as this shows that victims of abuse have greater confidence that if they report to the police they will be listened to, taken seriously and their report will be investigated fully, regardless of when the offence took place."" The figures show that knifepoint rape increase from 199 to 294, while knifepoint sexual assaults were up 22% to 111 from 91. The number of race hate crimes also increased by 84% to 37,484, which statisticians said was driven by offences in the wake of the murder of soldier Lee Rigby. The ONS report said: ""The pattern of higher levels of race and religious hate crime in May, June and July 2013 compared  with the same period in the previous year is not observed for the other strands of hate crime (sexual orientation, disability and transgender identity; data not shown)."" However, over all the number of crimes was down on the same time last year. Crime prevention minister Norman Baker said: ""There are now 2.3 million fewer crimes per year than when the coalition Government took office. ""That includes 413,000 fewer acts of violence and 160,000 fewer burglaries, with criminal damage down by 962,000 incidents. This is good news for a safer England and Wales. ""There are also positive signs that police recording of crime is improving, and that more victims of crimes such as sexual offences and fraud are coming forward - which is something we welcome."""

The RFA Argus hospital ship is expected to leave its moorings in Cornwall's Falmouth Docks around lunchtime, loaded with three Merlin helicopters and a crew of around 350 - including 80 medics and 80 Royal Marines. The crew will form part of a 750-strong team of military personnel expected to reach Sierra Leone by November. The ship's Commanding Officer Captain David Eagles has warned that servicemen and women will face ""tough regulations"" while on board. Personnel will be banned from going ashore on leave during up to three months of deployment as part of strict rules designed to ensure the ship remains ""sterile"" from ebola. Royal Marines who leave the RFA Argus for operations in the local community will go through a decontamination process upon their return. Medics will take their temperatures twice a day and anyone who shows signs of ebola will be flown to a British treatment clinic in Kerry Town. Captain Eagles, 52, of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, admitted the measures were ""tough"" but necessary to safeguard against ebola. British army medics have already started to arrive in Sierra Leone to help with the battle against the disease. A team of 91, including nurses, doctors and infectious disease consultants, will join 40 soldiers already in the West African country to work at a UK-supported treatment centre, which has 12 of its 92 beds set aside for healthcare workers who risk infection while treating others. There have been 4,493 ebola deaths during the latest outbreak, with 926 coming in Sierra Leone, according to the World Health Organisation. Meanwhile, Public Health England has announced screening for passengers from ebola-risk countries is to be expanded to Birmingham and Manchester airports, although no start date has been revealed. After Thursday's meeting of the Government's Cobra committee, Downing Street said Chief Medical Officer Sally Davies still believes the risk to the UK is ""low""."
2014-10-17,The children's charity Barnardo's has been accused of blaming a victim of child sexual exploitation for her own sexual abuse by a gang of men who had groomed her.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20141017055308/http://news.sky.com/story/1353924/barnardos-accused-of-blaming-victim-for-abuse,"By Gerard Tubb, North Of England Correspondent The children's charity Barnardo's has been accused of blaming a victim of child sexual exploitation for her own sexual abuse by a gang of men who had groomed her. A letter written by a Barnado's project worker in 1993 says that abuse of a 16-year-old girl in accommodation owned by the charity could have been avoided if she had not placed herself in danger. The letter states that the girl was sexually assaulted but: ""The situation could have been avoided if [she] had not been party to the antics of a group of young men."" It goes on: ""Having consumed a quantity of alcohol and three valium tablets [she] was not able to maintain control or respond to the situation in a constructive and cohesive way."" Last month chief executive of Barnardo's Javed Khan condemned institutions that had blamed children for their own abuse and called for them to be investigated by the Government's independent inquiry into Child Sexual Exploitation. The victim, now 37, says the sexual assault that triggered the letter happened in her Leeds flat after British Pakistani men befriended her and let her run up debts before giving her drink and drugs. ""I woke up and I didn't have any clothes on and there were half naked men around,"" she said. ""I knew I'd been assaulted. I didn't know to what extent, I didn't know if I'd been raped or what, really."" She says she spent years feeling ashamed after being told at the time that the attack, which occurred shortly after she had left a children's home, was her fault. ""Looking back, how I feel now is absolute disgust with predominantly Barnardo's for knowing this happened, for blaming me for it happening and doing nothing about it,"" she said. She remained in the flat for a further six months and says her abuse by the men escalated over that time and included rape. Greg Mulholland, the woman's MP, is demanding an investigation by Barnardo's and Leeds City Council for what he calls ""shocking and utterly disgraceful"" behaviour. Gallery: Barnardo's Letter Accused Of Blaming Victim ""To actually blame her for the most appalling abuse and grooming and indeed blackmail that she suffered is really appalling,"" he said. ""This woman who was then a 16-year-old girl, shortly out of care, very vulnerable, was seriously, seriously let down by the two organisations who were there to protect her."" In a statement Barnado's told us it was shocked at the contents of the letter. The statement said: ""This woman has been very brave in bringing this issue to light. It must have been a very difficult and distressing step to have taken after so many years. ""Barnardo's takes this very seriously and we will fully investigate."" Nigel Richardson, director of children's services at Leeds City Council, said: ""We are very sorry to hear about what this young woman was subjected to."" He said the council was very keen to investigate the case, and added: ""We are confident that an incident like this would be managed very differently today."""

Xolile Mngeni, who was branded ""merciless and evil"" by a judge during his sentencing, was jailed for life for shooting Mrs Dewani while she was on honeymoon in Cape Town in 2010. The 27-year-old had been diagnosed with a rare brain tumour while awaiting trial four years ago and had surgery to remove it. The court had heard he would probably have only two to five years to live if the tumour returned. A judge said Mngeni 'brutally killed' Mrs Dewani 'with utter disdain' Mngeni's death comes 12 days after British businessman Shrien Dewani went on trial in South Africa accused of murdering his wife. The 34-year-old denies plotting to kill Mrs Dewani on their luxury getaway to Cape Town in November 2010, as they took a taxi ride through a township. The care home owner, from Weston-on-Trym near Bristol, is accused of paying three men to kill his Swedish-born wife, days after their lavish £200,000 wedding in Mumbai. Dewani said he and his wife were kidnapped at gunpoint as they drove through Gugulethu in Cape Town in a taxi. He was released unharmed, but Mrs Dewani's body was found in the abandoned car the next day. She had been shot. He denies the five charges against him, which include murder and conspiracy to commit kidnapping. Mngeni was convicted of shooting Mrs Dewani, while taxi driver Zola Tongo and Mziwamadoda Qwabe are also serving jail terms in connection with the murder. Reports suggest prosecutors in South Africa had spoken to Mngeni but had not planned to call him as a witness in the trial because of the poor state of his health. Mngeni was found guilty at the Western Cape High Court in 2012 of premeditated murder. He was also convicted of robbery with aggravating circumstances and illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition, but acquitted of Mrs Dewani's kidnapping. During sentencing, Judge Robert Henney said Mngeni deserved the maximum punishment for killing Mrs Dewani. He said: ""He had no regard to her right to freedom, dignity, and totally disregarded and showed no respect to her right to life by brutally killing her with utter disdain."""

Michael Haines and Barbara Henning made the plea ahead of a memorial service in Perth for David Haines, who was killed last month. Mr Haines urged people from all faiths to ""stand up with us calling for unity"" after what he called the ""senseless murders"" of his brother and Alan Henning. With his hand held by Mrs Henning, he said: ""I hope communities can become closer."" And he called on people to ""go into your neighbourhood and shake the hands of the people there no matter their background, race, colour or religion"". Alan Henning was killed by Islamic State He said the only way ""we can fight this evil is by bringing communities closer together"". He said: ""I am calling on all of us - every community, every faith - in the coming weeks and months, to find a single act of unity. One simple gesture, one act, one moment that draws people together."" He also paid tribute to his brother as well as Alan Henning, saying they were humanitarian workers who went into Syria to help people there. Mr Haines said: ""These were two men who sought to do good and sought to make the world a better place."" David Haines' teenage daughter, Bethany, and Michael Haines were among those who spoke at the service, where they shared some of their memories of him. Michael Haines' son, Euan, read a poem, Not How Did He Die, But How Did He Live, in memory of his uncle. The service also featured several hymns, including Amazing Grace, as well as the song Going Home, by the Scottish band Runrig. Earlier Mr Haines and Barbara Henning issued a joint statement, saying that ""together we (communities) have the power to defeat the most hateful acts"". They said: ""David and Alan's killers want to hurt all of us and stop us from believing in the very things which took them into conflict zones - charity and human kindness. ""We condemn those who seek to drive us apart and spread hatred by attempting to place blame on Muslims or on the Islamic faith for the actions of these terrorists."" The pair both said they had been overwhelmed by messages of support from the British public and people all over the world. Mr Haines also said his ""kind, caring"" brother ""didn't see other nationalities or religions, he just saw other human beings in need of a real help to get by, or sometimes a lot of help to live to see another day"". David Haines, 44, had been helping refugees in Syria in a camp near the Turkish border when he kidnapped in March 2013. Alan Henning, 47, was a volunteer on an aid convoy in Syria when he was taken in December 2013. Islamic State (IS) released videos in recent weeks showing their murders."

A ""yellow"" alert - warning of severe weather which has the potential to cause danger to life or widespread disruption - has been issued by the forecaster for much of Britain on Tuesday, when the worst of the storm will be felt following its expected arrival on Monday night. A 'yellow' weather warning has been issued for much of the UK on Tuesday Strong gales of up to 60mph and heavy rain will sweep west to east for around 24 hours, particularly affecting Northern Ireland, northern England, North Wales, southern and eastern Scotland. The Met Office said: ""The remains of Hurricane Gonzalo will move in to the Atlantic in the next few days and then run eastwards across the UK on Monday night. Gallery: Hurricane Gonzalo's Path The latest predicted route of Hurricane Gonzalo sees it travel across the Atlantic towards the UK and Ireland. Pic: NOAA Forecasters say a downgraded weather system could hit Ireland in the early hours of Tuesday morning, with this image showing their current margin of error. Pic: NOAA Gonzalo could hit the British territory of Bermuda on Friday. Pic: NOAA A NASA satellite image shows the hurricane as it departed the Caribbean ""Whilst this will no longer be hurricane strength it still looks likely to bring a period of very strong winds and heavy rain to the UK with the strongest winds on Tuesday as the low pressure clears eastwards. ""With the energy in this system and the complex nature of its transition from Hurricane to mid-latitude system some uncertainty remains in the track and intensity. ""However, there is the potential for some significant disruption to travel from the very strong winds on Tuesday, particularly as the strongest winds will coincide with rush-hour in places. ""Difficult driving conditions are also expected thanks to large amounts of spray on the roads and potential for wind-blown debris."" Hurricane Gonzalo has caused widespread damage in Bermuda, pulling up trees and cutting power to 70,000 people. Gonzalo approached Bermuda as a Category 3 storm then weakened to Category 2 before moving ashore with sustained winds of 110mph (175kph). Nearly all of the island's roads were impassable and cluttered with debris and fallen trees, police said. The roof of Bermuda's hospital was damaged and there was also water damage in its new intensive care unit. Royal Navy ship HMS Argyll, with a crew of some 180 sailors, is expected to arrive on Sunday to help with recovery efforts. The tiny territory is prepared for significant flooding as a result of storm surges."

The Foreign Office has confirmed it has spoken to concerned British families who have not heard from their relatives, though it is not thought there are any Britons among the dead. The body of a victim is moved from an ambulance to the morgue An unofficial list of trekkers suggests more than a dozen Britons may have been in the area at the time of the storms, although some of them have since been confirmed as safe or rescued.   More than 230 trekkers - most of them foreigners - have been rescued since Wednesday and search teams continue to scour the Annapurna range looking for more survivors, who may be sheltering in lodges and huts. Officials believe some people may be stranded in waist-deep snow in remote locations where mobile phone signal is poor. Two Israeli survivors hug each other The skies were clear at the start of the week, said Gombu Sherpa, who was guiding a group of Germans near the popular trekking circuit. But that changed suddenly when the snow blew in. ""We could hardly see anyone, even within a couple of feet. The wind was blowing snow and visibility was almost zero,"" he said, adding many people lost their way in the storm, but that everyone in his group survived. A friend of Lizi Hamer posted a message on Facebook to say she was safe One of his assistants, who was behind the group when the storm hit, was missing for an entire night, lost in the blizzard. ""We found him the next morning wandering in the snow. It is a miracle that he is alive,"" he said. Two trekkers from Hong Kong and 12 Israelis survived by taking refuge in a small tea shop . One of the Israelis, Yakov Megreli, said they tried to stay awake to stay warm. ""We tried not to sleep. We tried not to get hypothermia. It was a very frightening and awful situation,"" he said. A British survivor has told how he escaped the disaster. Some British trekkers remain unaccounted for despite the rescue effort Paul Sheridan said walkers were left stumbling through ""an abyss of nothing"" as dense snow left them unable to get their bearings on the slopes of the mountain range in northern Nepal. Mr Sheridan said that trekkers should have been prevented from going up the mountain, but were ""herded to their deaths"" by guides who he alleged were not carrying the correct emergency equipment. Friends of Briton Lizi Hamer, who was originally unaccounted for, posted a message on Facebook announcing she had been found safe. The 150-mile (240km) Annapurna circuit offers spectacular views of jagged peaks and Buddhist villages. It takes almost three weeks to complete and is nicknamed the ""apple pie"" circuit because of the teahouses lining the route that offer cold beer and home baking."

Cases are currently dealt with under the Malicious Communications Act in the magistrates courts, with a maximum sentence of six months. Now Mr Grayling is changing the law so the most serious cases can be passed on to the Crown Courts where they could result in much longer sentences. It comes after Peter Nunn was sentenced to 18 weeks in jail after an online ""campaign of hatred"" against the Labour MP Stella Creasy. In an interview with the Mail on Sunday, Mr Grayling said trolls were ""cowards who are poisoning our national life"". And Ms Madeley told the paper she supported the change, describing the current laws as outdated. They were drawn up 10 years ago before Twitter existed. She said: ""The current law obviously needs to be reviewed. It needs to be accepted that physical threats should not fall under the 'freedom of speech' umbrella. ""It should be seen as online terrorism and it should be illegal."""
2014-10-19,British companies have said they would consider following Apple and Facebook's lead by paying for female staff to freeze their eggs.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20141019064237/http://news.sky.com/story/1355951/uk-firms-consider-paying-for-egg-freezing,"By Rhiannon Mills, Sky News Correspondent British companies have said they would consider following Apple and Facebook's lead by paying for female staff to freeze their eggs. With the US tech giants now offering the fertility treatment as a benefit, Sky News asked 18 city firms if they would consider providing the same perk. Two said yes - Spacious, who provide office space, and the bike light company Blaze. Its founder Emily Brooke said she would even like the option herself. Facebook and Apple sparked a worldwide debate by offering the perk She told Sky News: ""It just gives you a little bit more freedom and takes the pressure off later on in life. ""The women in my team are just as ambitious as I am, they work incredibly hard and I wouldn't expect them to take up the opportunity, I wouldn't want them to necessarily, but I would like them to have the option."" Two years ago Sarah Brocklehurst had her eggs frozen. Now 43, she knows it isn't a guarantee she'll be able to conceive in the future but says it has given her a choice. She said: ""Just being able to freeze the eggs allowed me to take a little beat to relax, be able to look around sensibly at looking for a man that I wanted to be with, not just a man that I could have a child with, which is what I think - some women unfortunately fall into that trap. ""And also fix things like my career and my living situation. So I think it's the best thing I could have done really."" This week one of Europe's largest fertility clinics is opening on the edge of the city of London. For £200 Create Fertility will offer businesswomen fertility tests in their lunch hour and the chance to freeze their eggs so they can concentrate on their careers. But the centre's medical director believes all women over 29 should be routinely tested for free on the NHS to assess their chances of starting a family. Professor Geeta Nargund said: ""We need to be proactive if we want to help the nation's fertility in the long run and spend less in the long run on fertility treatments. ""We want to invest in proactive fertility screening on the NHS. Many times people say I wish I knew this, I wish I was able to find out about this five years ago."" With so many advancements in fertility treatments there are some who believe couples may be relying too much on science as a quick fix if they delay having a family. Professor Melanie Davies from the British Fertility Society said ""I know there are social pressures and I know that one has to find Mr Right but if you're in a good situation a good relationship the best advice is to get on and have children naturally ""That is far more successful than freezing ones eggs and more successful than having IVF at a later stage."" At a cost of around £7,000 for three rounds of egg freezing, women will need a decent salary or generous employer to pay for it, but all experts agree that age is still likely to be the biggest factor when it comes to a couple's chances of starting a family."
2014-10-19,Illegal immigrants suffering ill health are failing to seek treatment over fears that it could alert the authorities to their presence in the UK.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20141019064237/http://news.sky.com/story/1355948/illegal-migrants-too-scared-to-get-treatment,"By Emma Birchley, Sky News Correspondent Illegal immigrants suffering ill health are failing to seek treatment over fears that it could alert the authorities to their presence in the UK. A new report has revealed that 90% of undocumented migrants are not registered with a GP and a fifth of those - more than 100,000 - say it is because they are too scared to come forward. Richard is an asylum seeker and understands that anxiety. He came to Britain in 2003 fleeing persecution in Uganda. ""You get frightened so what happens is you decide to hide away and if you have any medical condition, any problem, you end up getting worse and worse and maybe in the end you may even die because you do not have any help,"" he said. The concern outlined in the report by the think-tank Demos, due to be published on Monday, is that failing to detect ill health early can ultimately result in increased treatment costs. But according to the document's author, Max Wind-Cowie, there is also the fear that transmittable diseases are being passed on to the wider public by those too anxious to seek help. ""When you think about global crises like ebola, what we need to make sure we do is find people who are unwell, make sure we are isolating them, make sure we are treating them,"" he said. ""We can't do that if they wait until they are incredibly unwell before going to seek health care because that means that it's already too late to prevent the infection from spreading."" In the end Richard did seek treatment from the organisation Doctors of the World in Bethnal Green, east London. It is the kind of clinic that has been proposed in the report - an all-in-one centre where patients can see a doctor but general advice and legal support is also provided. The difficulty is convincing vulnerable people it is safe to come forward. One idea is to allow health professionals to access information from the Home Office without permitting data to flow the other way. It will not be a popular plan with those who believe undocumented migrants should not have the right to free treatment. But Dr Clare Shortall, who volunteers for Doctors of the World, welcomes any move to make sure those in need get help. ""Regardless of your position on immigration I think we are talking about vulnerable people who are victims of trafficking, children, victims of domestic violence, pregnant women. We are talking about them not being able to access health care."""

The Trades Union Congress (TUC) organised the demonstrations under the banner Britain Needs A Pay Rise, following days of industrial action from nurses, midwives and civil servants. Midwives went on strike for the first time in their history over the Government's decision not to pay a recommended 1% increase to all NHS staff. Hospital radiographers and prison officers are due to hold strikes next week over the same dispute. TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""Our message is that after the longest and deepest pay squeeze in recorded history, it's time to end the lock-out that has kept the vast majority from sharing in the economic recovery. Gallery: Protesters March In London Calling For Pay Rise Tens of thousands of workers have been taking part in protests to call for an end to austerity and to highlight the need for pay to increase Public sector workers including teachers, nurses, civil servants and hospital cleaners marched alongside railway workers, postmen and employees from private firms The main rally was in London but protests were also held in Glasgow and Belfast The TUC organised the demonstrations under the banner Britain Needs A Pay Rise, following days of industrial action by public sector workers The TUC says people are facing the biggest squeeze on their incomes since Victorian times, claiming average wages have fallen by £50 a week in real terms since 2007 The TUC said between 80,000 and 90,000 were on the march in London ""The average worker is £50 a week worse off than in 2007 and five million earn less than the living wage. Meanwhile, top directors now earn 175 times more than the average worker."" Lynn Burbidge, a healthcare assistant at a hospital in Kent, said she was joining the march ""because the Government needs to listen to us"". She said every month she faces a decision of whether to ""pay your bills or buy food"" and constantly having to budget was ""demeaning"". ""I've worked for the NHS for nearly 30 years and I'm still in the same position,"" she told Sky News. ""I'm 20% worse off now than what I was 10 years ago ... while the Government they've just accepted an 11% pay rise - I'm only after 1%."" Jade Hill, 30, who works as a nurse at a hospital in Norfolk, said her pay meant she and her partner could not yet afford to start a family. ""I can barely afford to keep me and my husband, let alone having children on top of that, at the moment it is impossible,"" she said. One cleaner, called Nana, told Sky News how he struggles to provide for his family despite juggling three jobs and working a 12-hour day on minimum wage. ""My social life is very bad. Secondly, I have a lot of debt to pay. The TV licence is coming up and we haven't got enough money to pay it,"" he said. ""They wrote to me that the bailiffs will come to my house. I've no choice, (but to) pray for the nation to come to our aid, to increase our wages and then we can make our ends meet."" A Treasury spokesman said: ""Under this Government we've seen the largest annual fall in unemployment, more people in work than ever before, and inequality lower than the average under the previous government, proving that the Government's long-term economic plan is working. ""The only sustainable way to raise living standards is to keep working through the plan that is building a resilient economy and has enabled us to announce the first real-terms increase in the minimum wage since the great recession. ""We appreciate that the effects of the great recession are still being felt, which is why we have taken continued action to help hard-working people by cutting income tax, freezing fuel duty, helping local authorities to freeze council tax, cutting energy bills, providing free school meals, and reducing childcare costs."""

The disgraced footballer, who continues to protest his innocence, has had his case prioritised by the body, which examines possible miscarriages of justice. If the review goes in Evans' favour, his conviction could potentially be overturned, as the CCRC has the authority to direct cases to the Court of Appeal. A CCRC spokesman told Sky News: ""In line with our published policy on prioritisation, and in relation to the facts of the case and the issues raised in Mr Evans' application to us ... we now expect our substantive investigation to begin within the next few weeks."" ""The decision to prioritise the case simply brings forward the starting point of the investigations to decide whether or not there may be grounds for us to refer the case to the court of appeal. ""It does not in any way represent a judgment by the commission as to the merits of the case or its chances of being referred."" Evans was released from jail on Friday after serving half of a five-year sentence for raping a woman. In an interview with the Sunday Mirror shortly before he was released, he said he was ""ashamed"" of his actions but insisted he is innocent of rape. The 25-year-old striker added that cheating on his girlfriend, Natasha Massey, was ""unforgivable"". ""It was something that should never have happened,"" he said. ""I cheated on my girlfriend and had sex with this girl - but it was definitely consensual."" A statement posted on Evans' website from his family and girlfriend said he would ""continue the fight to clear his name"". It added: ""Chedwyn Evans maintains his absolute innocence and his family, friends and many who know the true facts of the case believe that his conviction was a gross miscarriage of justice."" Katie Russell, of charity Rape Crisis, told the Sunday Mirror the player's words were insulting to his victim. ""His protestations of innocence and sympathy only for his girlfriend are insulting, harmful and hurtful - not only to his victim, but also to the countless other victims of sexual violence out there,"" she said. ""He has never taken a moment's responsibility for his crime nor shown any regard for the terrible impact it has had on her.""

Sheffield United Community Foundation patron Charlie Webster said if Evans re-signed for the club she would be ""heartbroken"" and ""disappointed"". She told Sky News: ""It would send out the wrong message to the next generation to watch Ched Evans score a goal and cheer him on as a hero."" Ms Webster also said it would ""wrong"" for her to stay in her role with the foundation if the club took him back.

Virginia State Police Chief Tim Longo and colleagues told a news conference further forensic tests would be conducted to establish if the remains are those of the 18-year-old. The remains were found at around noon on Saturday by volunteers searching an abandoned property to the south of Charlottesville, a college town about 100 miles southwest of Washington. Albemarle County's Police Chief Col Steve Sellers said: ""Right now we have the discovery of human remains and a great deal of work ahead of us. Jesse Matthew has been charged in the case. Pic: Galveston Sheriff's Office ""We cannot and will not jump to any conclusions regarding today's discovery. I ask for the public's patience as we move forward and pursue what is now a new, ongoing death investigation."" Police said a public search planned for Walnut Creek Park in Albemarle County on Sunday had been called off. Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr, 32, has been charged with abduction with intent to defile Ms Graham, who has been missing since 13 September. Thousands of volunteers had joined searches for the student, who was born in the UK but has lived in the US since she was five. Virginia State Police have said Mr Matthew's arrest provided a ""forensic link"" to the 2009 unsolved murder of Morgan Harrington, a 20-year-old who also went missing from Charlottesville. The suspect was arrested on a Texas beach last month. He is the last man to have been seen with Ms Graham before her disappearance. Police believe Ms Graham met Mr Matthew at the Tempo Restaurant in Charlottesville. Mr Matthew's father has insisted he is innocent and was probably simply trying to help Ms Graham."

2014-10-22,"At least five Britons a week are travelling to Iraq and Syria to fight for Islamic State, according to the UK's most senior police officer.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20141022051903/http://news.sky.com/story/1357573/five-britons-a-week-joining-is-top-cop-warns,"At least five Britons a week are travelling to Iraq and Syria to fight for Islamic State, according to the UK's most senior police officer. The stark warning by Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe that returning fighters posed a terrorist threat, came as it emerged a third man from Portsmouth had been killed in Syria. Manunur Roshid, 24, was one of five friends who travelled to the war-torn country in October last year. Around 500 would-be British jihadists are already thought to have joined IS, which has shocked the world with its brutality, including the beheading of two British hostages. And the revelation by Sir Bernard indicates their number continues to swell. Islamic State fighters have captured large areas of Syria and Iraq He said in a speech: ""The advance of IS across Iraq and Syria, which happened incredibly quickly, indeed now towards Turkey, are not just the horrors of distant lands. ""We know that over 500 British nationals travelled to join the conflict. Many have returned and many will wish to do so in the coming months and perhaps in future years. ""We still have an average of five people joining them a week. Five a week doesn't sound much but when you realise there are 50 weeks in a year, 250 more would be 50% more than we think have gone already. ""Those numbers are a minimum. Those are the ones that we believe have gone. ""There may be many more who set out to travel to another country and meandered over to Syria and Iraq in a way that is not always possible to spot when you have failed states and leaky borders."" And Sir Bernard said the return of ""potentially militarised individuals"" to the streets of the UK ""is a risk to our communities"". He backed plans revealed by the Government last month to give authorities the ability to seize the passports of those they suspect of travelling abroad to fight with terror groups at the border. He added: ""The drumbeat of terrorism in the UK has changed. It's faster and it's more intense."" Police activity has escalated to combat the terrorist threat, with ""disruption"" activities at ports such as stopping suspects and seizing cash up by more than 50%. The Metropolitan Police have made 218 arrests for terrorist-related activity so far this year - an increase of around 70% compared to three years ago, Sir Bernard said. Police and partner agencies are disrupting several terrorist plots each year, including at least one ""major"" conspiracy every year since 2001, Sir Bernard said. Earlier this month, London Mayor Boris Johnson revealed that thousands of terror suspects are being spied on every day by UK security services. With little sign that the allure of Islamic State is diminishing, the Government is refocusing its anti-extremism programmes. The Prevent initiative is now almost entirely devoted to the threat from IS Sky News was given rare access to an anti-extremism workshop in Walthamstow, east London. Addressing the group was Hanif Qadir, himself a former Jihadi fighter, now an outreach worker helping to steer young people away from extremism. Mr Qadir told them the methods used by Islamic State were brutal in the extreme and against Islamic law.  Their refrain, he said, was: ""If you can't use a bomb, use a bullet, if you can't use a bullet use a brick. ""Do whatever you can and if you can't do that spit in their face.. and if you can't do that, you're not a Muslim."" ""Now we all know this is nonsense,"" he said. He told Sky News: “The only way to tackle this problem is do exactly the same as they (Islamic State) are doing, only a little bit better. That's the only way you can do it. “Using online and social media has been very effective and very potent.. we need to do the same and harness social media and the internet as well.” Mr Qadir’s group recently released their own internet video, using the Not In My Name hashtag. The video went viral and was praised by US President Barack Obama."

NHS England confirmed family doctors would receive the cash under a new scheme to ensure sufferers are identified early and given tailored care. But Dr Iona Heath, ex-president of the Royal College of GPs, told the medical magazine Pulse: ""I think the proposal is an intellectual and ethical travesty."" Health experts believe that just under half of the people living with dementia are not being diagnosed. Under the scheme, GPs will get the cash for every additional dementia diagnosis they make over the next six months. Dr Martin McShane, NHS England national director for long-term conditions, said: ""Dementia can be devastating both for individuals and their families. ""We know that more needs to be done across the health service to ensure that people living with dementia are identified so that they can get the tailored care and support they need. ""This additional investment is part of a drive to ensure this."" Health chiefs have identified a gap of about 90,000 patients, an average of 12 per practice, who could benefit from a more timely diagnosis. However, the Patients Association say the scheme is ""a distortion of good medical practice"". Chief executive Katherine Murphy said: ""We know GPs receive incentive payments to find all sorts of conditions, such as high cholesterol, raised blood pressure and diabetes - but this seems a step too far. It is putting a bounty on the head of certain patients. ""Good GPs will be diagnosing their dementia patients already. This seems to be rewarding poor GPs. ""There is an issue of people presenting late with dementia to doctors, but this is not the right way to go about tackling that. ""If people were given hope that something could be done, that would be the greatest incentive for coming early."" Dr Matthew Norton, Head of Policy at Alzheimer’s Research UK said: “For people with dementia, a diagnosis can help them to make sense of the symptoms they are experiencing, as well as opening the door to vital support and treatments. ""The ability to offer a timely diagnosis is important, but it’s also critical for people to have access to the services they need once a diagnosis has been given."" “Diagnosing dementia can be a challenge, particularly as the symptoms can overlap with other health conditions, and research is crucial to improve diagnosis methods."""

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has urged local authorities to tackle a growing crisis in the state of people's teeth in disadvantaged areas of England. Tooth decay and gum disease are the two most common, largely preventable dental problems, said NICE. The young and the vulnerable are said to be most at risk so new advice on how to tackle the problem is being issued. In new and wide-ranging guidance, NICE said parents and children in many areas need support to stop tooth decay and diseases linked to poor oral hygiene. Severe tooth decay has been reported in children as young as three and in many cases is starting much earlier. NICE suggests local authorities consider supervised tooth-brushing and fluoride varnishing programmes in nurseries and primary schools in areas where children are at high risk of poor oral health. Professor Mike Kelly, director of the Centre for Public Health at NICE, said: ""Children as young as three are being condemned to a life with rotten teeth, gum disease and poor health going into adulthood. ""Many children have poor diets and poor mouth hygiene because there is misunderstanding about the importance of looking after children's early milk teeth and gums. ""They eat too much sugar and don't clean their teeth with fluoride toothpaste. ""As a society we should help parents and carers give their children the best start in life and act now to stop the rot before it starts."" In Salford, Greater Manchester, rates of infant tooth decay are among the highest in the country. The Health Protection Agency had begun a series of pilots in nurseries to make sure that children brush their teeth. Laura Shingler, a nursery practicioner at Kidz 'r Us, is in charge of toothbrushing sessions. She said: ""I have seen children as young as three with rotten teeth through eating too many sweets and lack of brushing. Here we start brushing as soon as they get teeth. ""It's about getting them in the habit of daily brushing. ""If parents arent doing it, we'll make sure it's done."" Mandy Murdoch, an independent health strategist with experience of commissioning oral health promotion programmes, said: ""Unfortunately, many people believe that the health of a child's first teeth does not matter as 'they will fall out anyway'. ""However, severe tooth decay at a young age can have negative consequences in later life."""

Paul Cantlie died ""from complications following pneumonia"", his family has said. The 80-year-old recorded a video message for his son's Islamic State (IS) captors earlier this month, which has so far gone unheeded. In a statement, the family said they had made urgent attempts to inform their son since the death last Thursday. John Cantlie has featured in several Islamic State videos They said: ""Paul died not knowing whether John's captors had received any of the messages he had sent to them. ""The failure of communication to date has inevitably led to a terrible sense of abandonment, particularly for John's father, with the family feeling ignored."" The Cantlies, from Surrey, added that the father-of-three's strength had been diminishing since his photojournalist son was kidnapped in Syria two years ago. ""Paul Cantlie will be remembered by many for his fortitude, quiet courage, wry humour and keen intelligence, as well as for his great gentleness,"" their statement went on. John Cantlie has been shown in a series of videos in recent weeks in which he speaks about Islamic State (IS) and criticises the West over its strategy in Iraq and Syria. In a video message from his hospital bed earlier this month, his father said: ""For the first time in almost two years, we saw John when he made a televised broadcast during which he told viewers that he was still a prisoner of the Islamic State and that maybe he will live and maybe he will die.

Philip Spence has been told to expect a ""very substantial sentence"" after using a claw hammer to beat the wealthy tourists, leaving all three women with life-changing injuries. The 32-year-old walked into London's four-star Cumberland Hotel in the early hours of 6 April 2014, and went up to the victims' room, where the door was unlocked. One of the women, Ohoud al Najjar, was repeatedly bludgeoned with such force that her skull splintered, as her nine-year-old nephew hid beside her underneath the bedsheets. The claw hammer used in the attack was on the seventh floor of the hotel The traveller, who was visiting the capital from the United Arab Emirates, survived the hammer attack, but now has just 5% brain function, is unable to speak and has lost an eye. Spence ran away from the scene with a case packed with iPads, expensive jewellery and smartphones, leaving the women for dead.  The drug addict left the bloodstained weapon on the seventh floor of the hotel, and it was soon traced to his accomplice, Thomas Efremi. Although Spence, from Harlesden, northwest London, admitted the attack, he denied three counts of attempted murder, as well as conspiracy to commit aggravated burglary. Philip Spence walking into the lobby of the Cumberland Hotel Simon Mayo QC had told Southwark Crown Court: ""The intention of their attacker, say the prosecution, was to kill them. ""The scene that met the eyes of the police and emergency services as they arrived in the aftermath was, in the words of one of those attending, 'horrific'."" Efremi, who had supplied Spence with the claw hammer, was also found guilty of conspiracy to commit aggravated burglary, as he had used the family's credit cards to withdraw £5,000. After the verdict was read out, the 57-year-old began pacing around the dock, and told an officer nearby: ""I'll kill [Spence]. He stitched me up."" Thomas Efremi used the family's stolen credit card to withdraw £5,000 Shortly afterwards, he turned to a detective sitting in the public gallery, and warned: ""Don't f****** look at me."" The tourists had left the door open to allow a fourth sister, Sheika al-Mheiri, to return after she had gone to see her brother and buy some chocolate. In a victim impact statement, one of the sisters, Khulood, said: ""Philip Spence has never once shown any ounce of remorse; his sole concern has been for himself and to find some way of getting away with what he did. ""I will never, ever forgive him, and sincerely hope that one day he feels the full burden of what he has done."" Both men have been remanded in custody and will be sentenced on 17 November."

Eleven of the servicemen have been identified after surviving relatives were traced and DNA samples were provided. ""I got this letter saying they matched the DNA, and Great Uncle John was one of the 58 in this trench in France. It was mind blowing and humbling,"" said Barrie Richmond, from Ravenshead, Nottinghamshire. His relative, Private John Richmond, and many other comrades from the 2nd Battalion, York and Lancaster Regiment, were killed in France on 18 October, 1914.

Mr Richmond knew nothing of his great uncle until he began researching his family tree, and was later contacted by the Ministry of Defence's Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre in Gloucester. ""He'd joined up the day after war was declared,"" Mr Richmond explained. ""He'd been in before as a regular, but came out and served in the reserves. ""Then, the day after it was declared, he enrolled again, which makes me very proud of him because he just could have left it or not even gone. ""He left his wife and family behind to go and fight for the country."" Sue Raftree is part of a small ""Commemorations Team"" who works to find descendants. Sometimes, artefacts like pipes, lockets and whistles are discovered with remains which help to solve cases. But without such clues, if the team think there is a good chance of identification, they can turn to science. ""To be able to use DNA has made it much easier,"" said Ms Raftree. ""We are rewarded by being able to identify more of our soldiers and to trace their families and give final closure.""

""My son is going out with me, but the grandchildren will be able to go in the future and see the headstone and the sacrifice he made, and the great grandchildren. ""It'll be there for those generations in the family to go and remember John as a member of the family tree who made a sacrifice for them as well as me."" He has been given the opportunity to write an inscription for Pte Richmond's headstone. It reads: ""He fell and was lost but now he is found. Rest in peace at last. His life given so that we might be free."""

Michael Fallon told MPs in a written statement: ""As well as their operations over Iraq, both Reapers and Rivet Joint surveillance aircraft will be authorised to fly surveillance missions over Syria to gather intelligence as part of our efforts to protect our national security from the terrorist threat emanating from there.

Ahead of their reinterrment in France, here are their stories. Herbert Ernest Allcock Pte Herbert Ernest Allcock Herbert Allcock, born in 1882 in Leeds, was 32 when he was killed in action on 18 October 1914. He enlisted with the Yorks and Lancs Regiment on 14 June 1902. He enlisted for three years, but extended this to a period of eight years and served in India between 1905 and 1910. He married Ethel Bloomfield in 1911 and had two daughters - Winifred and Ellen. His widow never remarried, and she died at the age of 91 in 1975.

Following his transfer to the Reserve, John settled back into civilian life. He married Rachel Forster in 1908 and the couple had two children - Edna and Arthur. John was mobilised immediately upon the declaration of war. He was 30 when he was killed in action. William Butterworth Pte William Butterworth William Butterworth enlisted into the Yorks and Lancs on 13 December 1904, initially for three years. He served in India between 1905 and 1911, was discharged to the Reserve in 1912, and was mobilised at the outbreak of war. He married Margaret Clegg six months beforehand, and the couple had a baby daughter, Beatrice, in early 1915. Mr Butterworth would never meet her. Cpl Francis Carr Dyson Francis Carr Dyson was born in 1889 in Wakefield - the second eldest in a family of six children. Francis lived in various parts of Yorkshire due to the varied career of his father, who worked as a miner, police constable, iron foundry worker and a political journalist. He enlisted with the York and Lancs in 1908 for a term of seven years with the Colours. Pte Walter Ellis Walter Ellis was born in 1883 in Doncaster.

Leonard Arthur Morley Pte Leonard Arthur Morley Leonard Arthur Morley was born in Surrey in 1892 into a family with 10 children. He and his siblings were exceptionally tall by contemporary standards. He enlisted on 27 April 1907, by falsely declaring himself to be 18 years of age. In fact, he was still two months short of his 15th birthday. After completion of five years' service with the 2nd Battalion, Leonard was transferred to the Reserve in June 1912. He settled in Sheffield and was planning to marry before mobilisation intervened in August 1914.

Mr Griffin, who was expelled from the BNP earlier this month, told the inquest that he went to Syria as an MEP in 2013 to raise awareness of the issue of European people fighting jihad in the country. While there he said he met an influential businessman whom he helped to write a proposal for a ""deradicalisation programme"" to rehabilitate jihadists using a form of Islamic theology called Sufism. Mr Griffin described it as a ""brand of pacifist Islam based on love"". Dr Abbas Khan died last year while in prison in Damascus Hearing about Dr Abbas Khan's detention in the country, Mr Griffin then suggested to the Syrians that Dr Khan should be released so he could be one of the first to go through this programme. Mr Griffin said the Syrian regime, including President Bashar al Assad, liked the idea as it would be ""good publicity"" and moves were made to get Dr Khan released. Gallery: Timeline: Dr Abbas Khan Abbas Khan was from Streatham, south London, and worked as an orthopaedic surgeon The surgeon arrived in Turkey on November 12, 2012. He initially worked alongside the UK-based charity Human Aid. Dr Khan's brother said he 'passionately believed in helping those in their hour of need' The 32-year-old, who had two children, specialised in hand and nerve trauma He worked for Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust, from which he took a six-month sabbatical in 2012 Dr Khan then travelled to Turkey to help injured refugees crossing the Syrian border At his funeral, his brother Shahnawaz Khan remembered his brother as 'a star' The doctor's mother was heard saying 'please give me my son back' The inquest previously heard there was no evidence to suggest that Dr Khan had travelled to Syria to fight. The orthopaedic surgeon was arrested in the war-torn country under terrorism charges while volunteering in a hospital in Aleppo. Dr Khan's family were aware of Mr Griffin's plans and were happy for him to go through the programme as he would be freed. Despite claims that there was ""personal authorisation"" from Mr Assad, Dr Khan died days before he was supposed to be released. Syrian authorities say Dr Khan hanged himself but his family contest this. The inquest also heard that Mr Griffin believed his contact was extremely close to Mr Assad, whom he describes as ""not the monster that media portray"". The former BNP leader said he thought the president would not have ordered for Dr Khan to be killed. Instead, Mr Griffin speculated to the jury at the Royal Courts of Justice that Dr Khan was threatened with torture and may have ""been forced to take his own life"". The inquest is expected to end with a jury decision next week."
2014-10-30,"The RAC is demanding action to cap motoroway service station fuel prices, describing them as ""21st century highway robbery.""",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20141030142054/http://news.sky.com/story/1363405/rac-demands-motorway-petrol-price-caps,"The RAC is demanding action to cap motoroway service station fuel prices, describing them as ""21st century highway robbery."" The motoring group said its research found that petrol and diesel costs can be over 15p-per-litre more expensive and it was unacceptable that drivers had to pay such a premium. Motorists told the RAC's survey they felt they were being ""held to ransom"" with one-in-four saying they refused to buy fuel at services and almost one-in-two admitting they only used motorway stations as a last resort. The RAC said almost two-thirds of those questioned wanted Government or industry action to cap fuel, so it was no more expensive than on non-motorway forecourts. Supermarket chains generally offer the best UK fuel deals The organisation said the results highlighted ""real concern"" about drivers risking their fuel tanks running dry rather than filling up at motorway services, posing a danger to themselves and other motorists. Its fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: ""It's no wonder that motorists feel held to ransom with prices on the motorways inflated to such an extent. ""In some cases motorway petrol and diesel might even be 15p dearer than the cheapest forecourts, which would add as much as £8 to the price of a tank of an average family-sized vehicle. ""We can see no reason why motorway fuel should be so much more expensive. In fact, arguably it is much easier from a delivery point of view than it is getting fuel to urban filling stations. ""We're calling for motorway fuel retailers to be more reasonable with their pricing."" It also suggested service stations were forced to display the price of their fuel well before the exit so drivers knew how much it would cost to fill up before leaving the motorway. The industry has previously explained that its prices are higher on motorways because of extra delivery, site and staff costs."
2014-10-30,The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has launched a formal criminal probe into Tesco's accounting crisis that led the UK's biggest retailer to overstate profits by £263m.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20141030142054/http://news.sky.com/story/1362777/tesco-faces-criminal-probe-over-profits-crisis,"The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has launched a formal criminal probe into Tesco's accounting crisis that led the UK's biggest retailer to overstate profits by £263m. The news was confirmed by both the supermarket chain and SFO, hours after Sky News first revealed details of the investigation. The company said: ""Tesco confirms that it has been notified by the SFO that it has commenced an investigation into accounting practices at the company. ""Tesco has been co-operating fully with the SFO and will continue to do so. ""Tesco has been notified by the Financial Conduct Authority that, in light of the SFO investigation, its investigation will be discontinued."" The SFO probe, while not entirely unexpected, adds to the sense of crisis at Tesco. The company, which has lost more than half its value during the last year, has been hit by unprecedented boardroom turmoil, with the chairman, Sir Richard Broadbent, planning to quit next year. Eight executives, including UK managing director Chris Bush, have been asked to stand aside pending the outcome of investigations into the accounting mis-statement, which relate to payments from major suppliers. Deloitte, the accountancy firm, and Freshfields, Tesco's legal adviser, undertook a preliminary probe, which was handed to the retailer's board last week. That report has been handed to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), with which Tesco said earlier this month it is co-operating. Dave Lewis, the new Tesco chief executive, last week unveiled a fall in half-year profits of more than 90% as the company battles to recapture market share lost to discounters such as Aldi and Lidl. Tesco has also been deserted by some of its leading shareholders, including the US-based Harris Associates and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, amid concern over its strategy and the state of its balance sheet. The turmoil has forced Tesco to shore up its financial position by turning to five banks to lend the company £1bn each in order to head off the prospect of lenders calling in existing loans. The Daily Telegraph reported on Wednesday that major consumer goods companies which supply Tesco have asked auditors to scrutinise their dealings with the retailer. The SFO, which has powers to prosecute companies as well as individuals, has been pursuing high-profile cases against Barclays, GlaxoSmithKline and Rolls-Royce, among others."
2014-10-30,Barclays has confirmed a £500m provision for fines relating to allegations foreign exchange markets were manipulated by banks.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20141030142054/http://news.sky.com/story/1363191/barclays-sets-aside-500m-over-for-ex-probe,"Barclays has confirmed a £500m provision for fines relating to allegations foreign exchange markets were manipulated by banks. The London-listed lender announced the figure in its third-quarter results statement which also contained further costs associated with the historic payment protection insurance (PPI) mis-selling scandal. It set aside an additional £170m for PPI but said it was also releasing a previous charge of £160m related to the sale of interest rate hedging products. The group made a statutory profit before tax of £3.7bn over its first nine-months - a rise of 30.5% on the same period last year. The performance was driven by stronger performances from its Personal and Corporate and separate Barclaycard arms, though investment bank profits tumbled 38% to £1.3bn as its group contribution continued to shrink under chief executive Antony Jenkins. He said the results reflected further progress towards key goals under its Transform programme - aimed at making Barclays the ""go-to"" bank - and demonstrated greater resilience through its rebalancing from the ""casino banking"" days. ""In aggregate, this is a good performance from the group, our strategy is working, and we expect to see continued progress as we go forward,” he added. Sky News reported on Wednesday that Barclays, HSBC and RBS were poised to set aside roughly £1bn for settlements with regulators following probes into the abuse of critical foreign exchange benchmarks. It is understood that settlements between UK banks and the Financial Conduct Authority could be announced as soon as next month. The additional provision for costs associated with PPI means Barclays has now set aside more than £5bn. Lloyds confirmed earlier this week its PPI bill had topped £11bn."
2014-10-30,The Australian owner of the Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks says it may float them on the stock market as it prepares to exit UK banking.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20141030142054/http://news.sky.com/story/1363306/two-banks-face-sale-as-owner-plots-uk-exit,"The Australian owner of the Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks says it may float them on the stock market as it prepares to exit UK banking. National Australia Bank (NAB) said it was considering a number of options for the banks, which collectively employ more than 7,000 staff and have proved costly since the financial crisis, given their exposure to toxic property loans. NAB, which has owned Glasgow-based Clydesdale since 1987 and Yorkshire since 1990, said the pair were now well placed for ""sustainable growth"" after an efficiency drive and greater emphasis on product competitiveness. Chief executive Andrew Thorburn said: ""Clydesdale and Yorkshire Banks are strong brands with good market shares in the communities in which we operate. ""We’ve made good progress in the past year in sharpening the competitiveness of our products, introducing customer service enhancements and improving the efficiency of our operations. ""In addition, we have undertaken extensive programmes to address legacy conduct issues and ensure fairness for our customers is at the heart of everything we do."" He argued the UK exit plan was an ""absolute priority"" for the group after it reported a 1.1% drop in full-year profits to £2.9bn. NAB reported £823m in one-off charges which included costs to cover mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI) and interest rate hedging products sold to small businesses. The company also said it was facing higher-than-expected levels of new complaints and warned that Clydesdale was still subject to an enforcement action by the City regulator in relation to its previous PPI complaints-handling process. Collective underlying annual profits for the banks, which exclude such costs, rose 6.8% to £283m. The prospect of the brands being sold on the stock market in the short term seem remote given current volatility and concerns about global economic growth and strength of the banking sector. Virgin Money and Aldermore, who were both planning flotations, recently confirmed they were delaying their listings until conditions improved."
2014-10-30,"Child sexual exploitation is a ""real and ongoing problem"" that has become ""normal"" in some parts of Greater Manchester, according to a new report.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20141030142054/http://news.sky.com/story/1363050/child-grooming-normal-in-parts-of-manchester,"By Nick Martin, North of England Correspondent Child sexual exploitation is a ""real and ongoing problem"" that has become ""normal"" in some parts of Greater Manchester, according to a new report. It suggests that youngsters are exposed to an increasing amount of explicit music and pornography which it is claimed is fuelling the problem.  The independent report by Ann Coffey, Labour MP for Stockport, was commissioned by Tony Lloyd, the Greater Manchester Police and Crime Commissioner, in response to a number of high-profile child exploitation cases. Home Secretary Theresa May described its findings as ""shocking"". In 2012, nine Asian men were jailed for grooming girls with alcohol, drugs and gifts before forcing them to have sex with multiple men. The case led to claims the authorities had ignored the problem for reasons of ""political correctness"". Ms Coffey said: ""My observations will make painful reading for those who hoped that Rochdale was an isolated case. This is a real and ongoing problem. ""I have been concerned about the number of people who have told me that in some neighbourhoods child sexual exploitation had become the new social norm. ""This social norm has perhaps been fuelled by the increased sexualisation of children and young people and an explosion of explicit music videos and the normalisation of quasi-pornographic images. ""Sexting, selfies, Instagram and the like have given rise to new social norms and changed expectations of sexual entitlement, and with it a confused understanding of what constitutes consent."" Some schoolgirls told her they were regularly approached by older men in the street and urged to get into cars on their way home from school. The problem will not be tackled unless there is a ""sea change"" in public attitudes away from a culture of blaming children and young people for bringing about their own sexual exploitation, the report claimed. Nicola Pomfrey first became the victim of exploitation from the age of 14. She said the man she was with controlled every aspect of her life.  She told Sky News: ""It felt like we were friends at first, he kept buying me food and cigarettes. Then it turned into a relationship. ""But as time went on I felt like I was trapped, there was no-one I could turn to and I became isolated from friends and family. ""I was vulnerable, I needed the attention and I got it from the wrong place. ""At the time I didn't feel like telling the police, or a social worker or a teacher would do any good. I suppose I didn't think they would believe that I was a victim."" Home Secretary Theresa May said a public consultation would be held on whether teachers, doctors and other officials should have a duty to report any suspicions - or face the law. ""This is yet another disturbing report which highlights unacceptable failings by authorities at a local level to ensure the protection of children,"" said Mrs May. ""The report's findings about the scale of child sexual exploitation and attitudes towards it are particularly alarming."" Hayley Harewood, chief executive of Oldham-based charity Keep Our Girls Safe, which helps around 200 young girls at risk of sexual exploitation, agreed with the report's findings. ""It is true that in some areas child sexual exploitation is normal. It is often the first experience many girls have in terms of a relationship,"" she said. ""On most occasions the girls don’t realise what’s happening to them until it is too late and they are trapped."" The 148-page report, titled Real Voices - Child Sexual Exploitation In Greater Manchester, recommends a radical new approach to tackling the problem led by young people, which recognises that the police, justice system and children's services alone cannot succeed in protecting children."

Mr Payne split from his wife Sara in 2003 after 18 years together, blaming the difficulties of coping with the loss of their daughter in 2000. Roy Whiting was convicted of Sarah's murder Speaking at the time, Mrs Payne told the News of the World: ""We know we're not the same people we once were - and everyone knows the awful reason why."" Mr Payne told the newspaper he felt guilty for being unable to protect his daughter and this had put strain on his marriage. Mrs Payne became a child protection campaigner after her daughter's death. Sarah's Law, which allows parents to check whether people with access to their children are sex offenders, was introduced in 2011. That same year Mr Payne was jailed after pleading guilty to glassing his brother Stephen following a heavy drinking session during which both men drank around three litres of cider each and a bottle of vodka. Sentencing him, Judge Jeremy Carey said he had the ""deepest sympathy"" for his loss, but the offence warranted a jail sentence. Convicted paedophile Roy Whiting is serving a life sentence for the eight-year-old's murder."

The Commons Defence Committee said it led to domestic abuse, violence and mental health issues. It called on the Ministry of Defence to develop a ""comprehensive strategy"" to reduce misuse and challenge the drinking culture - including a review of alcohol pricing and availability on military bases. ""Hazardous levels of alcohol consumption are the norm in the armed forces, regardless of service or gender,"" the committee said. ""Urgent action is needed to reduce the harm caused by the abuse of alcohol to armed forces personnel and their families. ""Too many members of the armed forces appear to believe that alcohol is integral to group cohesion or believe that alcohol is an appropriate way of coping with a return from a military deployment."" While the committee recognised that the MoD was aware of the seriousness of the issue, it said the measures taken so far had not had a ""noticeable impact"" on levels of drinking, with damaging consequences for personnel and their families. Criminal offending rates among personnel are lower than for the general population, but the committee said the rate for violent incidents was ""substantially higher"", and often linked to drinking following deployment on combat operations. ""The MoD needs to understand better the links between deployment on combat operations, alcohol misuse and domestic violence,"" the committee said. ""The MoD must be more proactive at all levels and should re-examine its policies on domestic violence and develop plans to intervene to prevent domestic violence or, at least, reduce the incidence of domestic violence by armed forces personnel."" Another issue highlighted by the committee was mental health. While the incidence of mental health problems among service personnel is comparable to the general population, those deployed in combat roles suffered twice the normal rate of post-traumatic stress. The problem was particularly marked among reservists, the committee found, who exhibit double the rates of post-traumatic stress than those found among regulars. The MoD has so far failed to identify the cause of the problem or come up with a solution, the committee said."
2014-10-30,"The Government has been accused of ""backpedalling"" over a Home Office report suggesting heavy penalties for illegal drug use make no difference.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20141030142054/http://news.sky.com/story/1363122/number-10-backpedalling-over-drug-laws,"By Tadhg Enright, Sky News Correspondent The Government has been accused of ""backpedalling"" over a Home Office report suggesting heavy penalties for illegal drug use make no difference. The report, which is based on international evidence, found ""no apparent correlation between the 'toughness' of a country's approach and the prevalence of adult drugs use"". It has led to another split in the coalition, with Lib Dems supporting its proposed reforms and the Conservatives opposing them. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the survey showed the ""war on drugs"" was failing. He added there was now an urgent need for change and accused the Conservatives of a ""totally misplaced, outdated, backward-looking view"" of the issue. The Lib Dem leader was backed by crime prevention minister Norman Baker who reacted angrily to suggestions the party was going soft on drugs. ""Nothing in the report talks about letting off drug dealers Scott free and that's not Lib Dem policy,"" he told Sky News. ""I fear this is Number 10 backpedalling because they have got inconvenient facts. ""The facts are we've got an independent study conducted by civil servants and some of my conservative colleagues apparently don't like some of the evidence that has come out. ""But if you look at a tree, it's a tree."" Downing Street hit back, warning the Lib Dems' calls for decriminalisation sent ""an incredibly dangerous message"" and insisting there would be no change in the current approach. David Cameron said: ""The evidence is, what we are doing is working. I don't believe in decriminalising drugs that are illegal today. ""I'm a parent with three children; I don't want to send out a message that somehow taking these drugs is OK and safe because, frankly, it isn't."" The dispute broke out after the Home Office finally agreed to release the study - which the Lib Dems had originally commissioned - comparing drugs policies in different countries. It was published alongside another report which recommends so-called legal highs be criminalised. Both coalition parties support a ban on their sale, which has been welcomed by campaigners including Maryon Stewart, whose daughter, Hester, died in 2009 after taking a lethal cocktail of alcohol and the legal substance GBL. She told Sky News: ""I think everyone agrees that there needs to be change, what's happening right now isn't working."" An opinion poll in The Sun suggests for the first time, most Britons believe the war on drugs can never be won. Some 71% of those surveyed said the war had failed, while 51% said it will always be doomed. The survey found 65% supported a review of drugs policy."

It comes amid what NATO described as an ""unusual"" increase in activity from Russian military jets over European airspace. The two Typhoon fighters were scrambled from RAF Lossiemouth to intercept the Russian Bear bombers, escorting them through British airspace on Wednesday. NATO said Russia had not filed flight plans and the bombers were not using on-board transponders, adding that this posed ""a potential risk to civilian aviation"". It happened on the same day two Typhoons from RAF Coningsby were sent to escort a suspicious plane to Stansted Airport in Essex.

The Prime Minister was overheard on Thursday referring to the incident as ""nerve-wracking"", saying the RAF were ""busy over the skies"". NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance ""remains vigilant and ready to respond"" to any Russian threat. ""We need to keep our forces ready, therefore we are investing in high readiness, new capabilities,"" Mr Stoltenberg told a press conference. ""We are increasing air policing as an answer to the increased air activities we are seeing from Russia."" The alliance said there had been at least four incidents involving more than a dozen Russian military planes over the region, with air forces from the UK, Scandinavia, Turkey, Germany and Portugal intercepting the offenders. Russian aircraft have been intercepted more than 100 times this year - three times more than in the whole of last year, it said.  NATO added that in a 24-hour period ending late on Wednesday, there were more than 19 cases of Russian aircraft in European airspace. Tensions between Russia and NATO are already high due to the crisis in Ukraine, which began after Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula early this year. Ian Litschko, a Russia analyst at the NATO Council of Canada, said the uptick in activity appeared to be a ""show of force"" by President Vladimir Putin. However, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was ""not worried"". ""Over the past few months, I have been seeing more intense activity when it comes to Russian armed forces,"" Mrs Merkel said. ""But at this point, I am not worried that there is major violation of our airspace."""
2014-10-30,RAF jets threatened to shoot down a Latvian cargo plane that lost communication with air traffic controllers as it headed towards London.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20141030142054/http://news.sky.com/story/1362888/raf-jets-threaten-to-shoot-down-cargo-plane,"RAF jets threatened to shoot down a Latvian cargo plane that lost communication with air traffic controllers as it headed towards London. Residents across Kent and East Sussex reported hearing a loud sonic boom as two Typhoon jets were scrambled from RAF Coningsby to intercept the Antonov An-26 airliner. They escorted the Russian-built plane to Stansted airport, where it landed at around 5.20pm. Police have searched the RAF-Avia plane, which was carrying car parts from Reims, France, to Birmingham. Two RAF Typhoons were scrambled Residents as far afield as Sevenoaks, Dartford, Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells took to social media to report a loud noise, which was felt at around 4.45pm. Some said the bang shook their house. The alarm was raised after the plane, travelling over the Channel towards Kent, failed to communicate with air traffic control as it entered British airspace. UK authorities threatened to destroy the plane if it continued its journey, according to a recording obtained by Sky News. ""Do not cross into UK airspace or you'll be shot down,"" a voice is heard saying on the audio recording. Iain Dodsworth, a resident in Crowborough, East Sussex, captured the sound of the sonic boom on a home security camera. He told Sky News: ""We thought the house was caving in or there had been an accident on the road. It was very loud, we thought 'there's no way that's thunder'."" One Twitter user, Jimmy Fletch, wrote: ""Big explosion just happened around my area. Heard all over Kent apparently! My whole house shook and it set off alarms down the street too."" An RAF spokesman said: ""Typhoon aircraft were launched this afternoon from RAF Coningsby to intercept a civilian aircraft south of London which was causing concern to air traffic control authorities. ""The aircraft was safely escorted to London Stansted. To fulfil their quick reaction role the Typhoons were cleared to travel at supersonic speed, any noise disturbance as a result of this is regretted."" The incident came as NATO reported an ""unusual level of air activity"" in European airspace. It said it has tracked four groups of Russian military aircraft ""conducting significant military manoeuvres"" over the past two days. The aircraft included strategic bombers, fighters and tanker aircraft over the Baltic Sea, North Sea, Atlantic Ocean and the Black Sea. An Essex Police spokesman said the Latvian plane was searched and then given the all-clear to continue its journey to Birmingham. ""All three people who were on board have been spoken to by police,"" he said. ""It was established that everything was in order and the reason for the short loss of communication was due to a change in airspace jurisdiction."""
