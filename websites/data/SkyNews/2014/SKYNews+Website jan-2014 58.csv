2014-01-16,"Police 'Cover Up Wrongdoing', Most Britons Say",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140117003627/http://news.sky.com/story/1196380/police-cover-up-wrongdoing-most-britons-say,"By Mark White, Home Affairs Correspondent More than half of Britons believe there is a culture of cover-ups within the police, a Sky News poll has found. 
	A total of 53% of members of the public questioned in the survey agreed that forces try to hide officers' wrongdoing. Just 18% of people polled disagreed that cover-ups take place. 
	The findings follow a series of controversies in which police have been accused of making serious mistakes and then attempting to shield officers from blame. 
	In 2012, it emerged that scores of statements from officers involved in the Hillsborough disaster in 1989 had been doctored to remove evidence of police failings. 
	Since September that year the Metropolitan Police has been embroiled in a damaging row with the former Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell, over whether he had called an officer guarding Downing Street a ""pleb"". 
	And last week the Met faced criticism in the wake of the shooting of Mark Duggan, whose death in 2011 prompted widespread rioting and looting. 
	An inquest jury found that armed police had acted lawfully in killing Mr Duggan, but his family have insisted officers shot an unarmed man. 
	However, the Sky News poll - commissioned as part of a series of reports on the police entitled A Fair Cop? -  found that despite these incidents, a large majority of the public still trust officers. 
	Asked whether their trust in police had changed over the past five years, 62% of those questioned said it had stayed the same, while 31% said it had gone down. 
	A total of 72% said they would trust the police to act if they reported a crime and 67% would trust officers to deal with them if they were the victim of a crime. 
	In relation to the conduct of officers over Hillsborough, 44% of those questioned said they now trust the police less, although 49% said it had made no difference. 
	The so-called 'Plebgate' affair prompted 51% of those questioned to say they had less trust in police, with 43% saying it made no difference. 
	However, 61% said the Mark Duggan case had not affected their trust in police. A total of 21% said they had less faith in officers, a number that increased to 40% among people who described themselves as non-white. 15% said they now trusted the police more. 
	Regarding police tactics, 60% of people who took part in the poll said they believed that 'stop and search' - a policy that ethnic minorities claim unfairly targets them - does more good than harm. 
	However, the same number of people questioned said they did not believe police should be able to use people's ethnic background to decide who to stop, a strategy known as racial profiling. 
	:: The Sky News poll was conducted by Survation who questioned 1,005 people earlier this week.

2014-01-16,Roache 'Raped Gullible 15-Year-Old Twice',https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140117003627/http://news.sky.com/story/1196134/roache-raped-gullible-15-year-old-twice,"By Mike McCarthy, North of England Correspondent Coronation Street star William Roache raped a 15-year-old girl twice in ""cold and calculating"" attacks, a jury has been told. 
	The alleged victim, now 62, told police in an interview played in court that the actor grabbed her without warning twice in 1967. 
	The woman said that on the first occasion Roache led her along a corridor and pushed her onto a bed in his bungalow at Haslingden in Lancashire. 
	She said that the actor had taken her virginity. 
	""Before I realised it - it was happening,"" she told Preston Crown Court. 
	""I did not know what to do. I was panicking. He was not aggressive in any way. I can remember thinking I just want to get out of here. 
	""I thought it was my fault."" 
	The woman told the court that later the same year the actor called her over to the door of another nearby property which he owned. 
	She said: ""Before I knew it I was grabbed again. This time I was really frightened. I didn't know if there was anybody in at the house. I should not have got into that position again a second time."" 
	She said she did not tell her father because he had a ""real temper problem"" and would have given her ""a good hiding."" 
	The woman told Preston Crown Court that some time later she was taking part in a carnival and standing in a line waiting to be judged. 
	""I heard it announced that the judge was Bill Roache. I was half way down the line and I thought he might not recognise me. 
	""He walked up the line with a microphone and he just said: 'Hello. I know you don't I?'"" 
	She said that the attacks started to bother her more and more as she grew older and that she began to have trouble sleeping because the memories were in the back of her mind. 
	""I was gullible and I did not see bad in anybody. I was a kid,"" she said. 
	When asked why she did not try to push her alleged attacker away and try to run off, she said: ""When somebody overpowers you, there is no escape. 
	""He was too big and I was just shocked. You just go into shock and you just freeze. A horrible, horrible experience."" 
	The complainant said she came forward in March last last year after a conversation with her son about the Jimmy Savile scandal and later revelations about Sir Cyril Smith. 
	Opening her cross-examination, Louise Blackwell QC, defending, told the witness: ""All the questions I am putting to you are on the basis that neither of these events happened, just so you understand."" 
	She then began asking her about the layout of Roache's former home. 
	William Roache, 81, has played the character of Ken Barlow in ITV's Coronation Street since the soap opera started in 1960. 
	He denies five charges of indecent assault and two of rape. 
	The trial continues.

2014-01-16,DLT: 'Victim Left With Eyes Full Of Tears',https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140117003627/http://news.sky.com/story/1196115/dlt-victim-left-with-eyes-full-of-tears,"By Tom Parmenter, Sky News Correspondent A former colleague of Dave Lee Travis has told a court how her ""eyes filled up with tears"" after the DJ allegedly touched her breasts. 
	The woman, who worked with him in local radio in the 2000s, said she initially had a good relationship with the man everyone called ""DLT"". 
	Speaking from behind a curtain at Southwark Crown Court, she said: ""He would give me big bear hugs every time he saw me, he would hug me a lot. 
	""I just saw him like a friendly grandad type - that is how he came across to me."" 
	The former journalist said that her opinion of him changed after an incident in their newsroom. 
	She told the court how the DJ approached her from behind and gave her another bear hug. 
	She said: ""He grabbed me on my face and then his hand was on that bit of your tummy below your belly button ... Nobody ever touches me there."" 
	She added: ""He took his arms back really slowly and deliberately over my breasts. 
	""I felt really confused, I went to the toilets and my eyes filled up with tears."" 
	She told the court how other female journalists at Chiltern FM had felt uncomfortable with the star's behaviour and on one occasion had confronted him about it. 
	Classic Gold Radio was based in the same building as Chiltern FM in Dunstable. 
	The boss of Classic Gold, Colin Wilshere, told the court it was his responsibility to try to ""have a word"" with Dave Lee Travis about the incident. 
	He said: ""I asked Dave to come into my office. 
	""He realised what I was talking about and said words to the effect of 'I didn't intend to upset her, that wasn't my intention'. 
	""He wanted to go and apologise and put matters right."" 
	Mr Wilshere explained how he ordered DLT to ""stay away"" from the newsroom. 
	But the court heard Dave Lee Travis ignored his boss and went straight back in to the newsroom to talk to the female journalist. 
	Mr Wilshere said he then had to ""haul"" DLT back into his office. 
	The former boss said: ""He had clearly not listened to what I wanted him to do. I just wanted him to go home because there was a lot of anger in the newsroom at that time. 
	""He was flustered, he was very angry with the whole thing ... he was very upset. He really wanted to talk to her and straighten it all out."" 
	The DJ then left the building and went home. 
	Mr Wilshere admitted that there was no record made of the incident and nothing was put on Mr Travis' staff file at the radio station. 
	Dave Lee Travis denies 13 counts of indecent assault and one of sexual assault. 
	His trial is due to last for six weeks.

2014-01-16,Teens Flee Top School For Caribbean Holiday,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140117003627/http://news.sky.com/story/1195966/teens-flee-top-school-for-caribbean-holiday,"Two teenagers have disappeared from their boarding school in the middle of the night - and flown to the Caribbean together. 
	Edward Bunyan and Indira Gainiyeva, both 16, are thought to have vanished at around 3am on Monday from Stonyhurst College in Clitheroe, Lancashire. 
	It is thought they ordered a taxi together to Manchester airport, where they caught a flight to the Dominican Republic. 
	Police there are said to be searching for them and, on Thursday morning, their parents were reported to be flying out to the Caribbean island to help find them. The two families are said to be desperately concerned. 
	According to their Facebook profiles, Indira says she is from Kazakhstan, but lives in Brighton. 
	Edward, who calls himself Eddy, says his home is Sotogrande, an upmarket residential development, popular with expats, in southern Spain. 
	A statement released to Sky News by the school on Thursday said: ""Two of our sixth formers left the College during the course of Monday morning and we have been working closely with their families and with the police since then. 
	""We understand from the police that they may be overseas, and we are awaiting more news. 
	""Our main concern is to be sure that they are safe and sound, and to reunite them with their families as soon as possible."" 
	Victoria Bunyan, the widow of Edward's older half-brother Christopher, told The Daily Telegraph: ""I don't approve at all but sounds like he is having quite an adventure."" 
	She said she had heard of the disappearance on the news, adding: ""It is going to get him in rather a lot of trouble I am sure. 
	""I'm not sure why he did it; they are very hormonal at that age. I don't know anything about the girl - I suspect her family are very worried too. 
	""I don't know what was going on at school for him but he is a bright boy so I am sure he will be ok and will work it out."" 
	Fellow pupils took to social media - using the hashtags #WheresBunyan and #WheresIndira - to try to find news of their friends. 
	A Lancashire Police spokesman said: ""We do know they are in the Dominican Republic, but as to their exact location - enquiries are continuing to try and trace them."" 
	Stonyhurst College was founded in 1593 and bills itself as one of Britain's leading Catholic boarding schools, adhering to the Jesuit tradition. 
	Past pupils include Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, former BBC director general Mark Thompson, three saints and seven archbishops. 
	It received an outstanding inspection report in April 2010 from Ofsted."
2014-01-16,Mikaeel Kular: Fears For Missing Edinburgh Boy,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140117003627/http://news.sky.com/story/1196009/mikaeel-kular-fears-for-missing-edinburgh-boy,"Concerns are mounting for Mikaeel Kular, who disappeared from his Edinburgh home more than 24 hours ago, as temperatures fall overnight. 
	A major search operation is continuing for the three-year-old who has not been seen since he went to bed at 9pm on Wednesday night. 
	Superintendent Liz McAinsh told a news conference: ""It is now getting dark, it's cold ... perhaps he's a bit disorientated, he's clearly going to be hungry now as well. 
	""I would ask local residents to think about their own homes, their gardens, their buckets, their outbuildings. Anywhere you think a three-year-old boy might be. Keep your eyes open in parks as well,"" she continued. 
	""We know his jacket and shoes are missing from the house. We don't know yet what has happened to him, but him going for a wander is one line of enquiry we're following up. 
	""We have air support out, we have dog support, we have resources coming from all over Scotland. 
	""It's cold, it's the middle of winter - we want to get Mikaeel home safely as quickly as we can."" 
	Mikaeel's mother and four siblings - including a twin sister - were in the flat in Ferry Gait Crescent, in the Drylaw area with him. 
	But when his mother went to find him at around 7.15am the next morning, he was missing. 
	Police Scotland have activated a Child Rescue Alert throughout the UK given the potential risk to Mikaeel and the time he has been missing. 
	It allows officers to interrupt television and radio programmes with news flashes, while members of the public are urged to call 0300 200 0200 if they have any information that may help police locate the missing youngster. 
	The little boy is described as 2ft tall and was possibly wearing a thigh-length beige jacket with a grey fur-lined hood, black gloves with multi-coloured fingers, dark navy blue jogging bottoms, a grey pyjama top featuring an embroidered turquoise dinosaur on the chest and brown shoes with two velcro straps. 
	He has a faded scar on the bridge of his nose and a sore on the left hand side of his mouth. 
	Coastguard and lifeboat crews are searching the shoreline in the Cramond and Drylaw areas close to Mikaeel's home, and mountain rescue teams have also joined specialists and residents on the ground, as police conduct house-to-house searches. 
	Forensic teams are examining a second address in a block of flats near his home. 
	Detectives are also looking at CCTV and want to speak to anyone who may have been travelling through the Muirhouse, Pennywell and Silverknowes areas this morning and may have seen the child walking on his own. 
	Superintendent McAinsh said there had been no arrests, no formal detentions, but several people were assisting officers with their inquiries. 
	""At this stage we’re keeping an open mind. There is no evidence to suggest criminality at this moment but clearly we are keeping an open mind. We are using all the resources at our disposal to find this boy,"" she said. 
	""We are following all lines of inquiry ... the family are being very helpful. As you can imagine, the mother is distraught and she just wants help in finding her child."" 
	She refused to comment on reports that there was a custody issue which Sky News Scotland Correspondent James Matthews had learned about ""on the basis of chat in the locality"". 
	He said: ""There was no particular answer on that. It may be that she has devolved that particular matter to the team on the ground but she wasn't able to say yes or no, about speaking to the father."" 
	Mikaeel's father is understood to be of Pakistani origin. Asked if he had been contacted, Supt McAinsh replied: ""We have spoken to all key members of the family ... and they are assisting us with our inquiries."" 
	Scores of volunteers in the area - parents and children - have been helping with the search, voicing a ""strong community spirit"" and concern for the missing boy, with no reported sightings of him yet. 
	Neighbour Nicola Garrick said of Mikaeel: ""I just know him from passing him on the street with his mum and that ... happy wee boy ... beautiful wee boy ... always got a smile on his face, so it's obviously a shock to see that he's missing."" 
	Jade Bremner, 22, who recently moved to the area with her two-year-old daughter, said she too found the disappearance ""shocking"". 
	Anyone with information can also contact Police Scotland on 101 or alternatively, the charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

2014-01-16,Michael Fallon Appointed Minister For Portsmouth,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140117003627/http://news.sky.com/story/1196174/michael-fallon-appointed-minister-for-portsmouth,"By Darren McCaffrey, Political Reporter Michael Fallon, who is currently both a minister for business and energy, is to be appointed Minister for Portsmouth to help promote growth and jobs. 
	It follows the decision made in November last year to move Navy shipbuilding to Scotland, resulting in the closure of the city's BAE Systems with the loss of more than 900 jobs. 
	It is believed to be the first time a minister has been given responsibility for a particular city since Michael Heseltine was made Minister for Liverpool in the wake of the Toxteth riots of 1981. 
	Mr Fallon will coordinate meetings of a task force made up of city leaders, representatives from BAE Systems, the Royal Navy and the Solent Local Enterprise Partnership. 
	The appointment of the Sevenoaks MP to the unpaid role has been welcomed by the Liberal Democrat leader of Portsmouth Council. 
Gerald Vernon-Jackson, said: ""I am glad that it seems ministers are listening and we are going to have somebody like Michael to help us cope with the loss of shipbuilding. 
	""We have had just silence from the Ministry of Defence about this, so I am pleased that another department is willing to listen."" 
	Portsmouth North MP Penny Mordaunt, who is currently taking part in ITV series Splash, said she asked the Prime Minister to intervene before Christmas. 
	Of Mr Fallon she said: ""He is a very good and capable minister and individual, but also he is somebody that can be very effective in rallying the support of colleagues in government."" 
	Portsmouth South MP Mike Hancock welcomed the news but warned: ""We have to bear in mind that Michael Fallon has already got two other jobs. I just hope he has the time and energy to devote to the issues we are facing."" 
	Downing Street said that Portsmouth needed particular attention, over other UK cities because ""there have been changes to Royal Navy shipbuilding, an industry that is very closely and directly linked to the Government."" 
	A spokesman for the Prime Minister refused to rule out re-appointing ministers for the regions of England."
2014-01-16,Anthony Grainger Death: Police Chief Charged,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140117003627/http://news.sky.com/story/1196353/anthony-grainger-death-police-chief-charged,"The chief constable of one of the UK's biggest police forces is to face a charge over the shooting of an unarmed odd-job man. 
	Sir Peter Fahy, from Greater Manchester Police (GMP), is accused of failing to discharge a duty under the Health and Safety at Work Act over the shooting of Anthony Grainger in March 2012. 
	He has a legal status that means he is a representative of GMP but does not share criminal liability. 
	The 36-year-old was shot by a GMP marksman after his car was stopped as part of a planned operation in Culcheth, Cheshire. 
	He was unarmed and there were no weapons in the car. 
	The father-of-two's family has criticised prosecutors' decision not to charge the marksman who took the fatal shot. 
	His cousin Wesley Ahmed, 45, said the family would consider bringing a private prosecution against the officer who fired the fatal shot, and possibly those who led the operation. 
	""I expected this, you can't get justice in this country, you've got no chance,"" Mr Ahmed said. 
	""I have been campaigning all over the country and none of the other deaths in custody families have managed to get justice. 
	""It's set for the police to be immune from prosecution. They have no accountability when it comes to a death in custody. If it was fraud, they would go to prison straightaway. 
	""People have been fighting for 20-odd years, you can't win. I thought Anthony's case might be the first one to crack the mould because they shot and killed an unarmed man. 
	""Now we'll look at a private prosecution."" 
	The Crown Prosecution Service decided the marksman who killed Mr Grainger should not face charges for murder or manslaughter because a jury would be likely to accept that he believed his actions were necessary. 
	""In the circumstances of this case, our assessment of the evidence is that a jury would accept that the officer did believe his actions were necessary and that the level of force used in response to the threat as he perceived it to be was proportionate,"" it said. 
	Westminster Magistrates' Court will host the first hearing for the health and safety charge on February 10. If the force is convicted, it could face an unlimited fine.

2014-01-16,Gene Therapy Breakthrough Could 'Cure' Blindness,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140117003627/http://news.sky.com/story/1195827/gene-therapy-breakthrough-could-cure-blindness,"By Thomas Moore, Health and Science Correspondent Patients suffering from an inherited form of blindness have for the first time had their vision dramatically improved by gene therapy. 
	The first six patients to be given the experimental injections into the back of the eye were all able to see better in dim light. 
	And two of them were able to read more lines on an eye chart. 
	The patients were born with a genetic form of blindness called choroideremia, which affects 1 in 50,000 people, most of them boys, who start to lose their vision in late childhood. 
	But in a groundbreaking clinical trial, doctors at the Oxford Eye Hospital injected a harmless virus that had been engineered to carry a working copy of the gene that sufferers lack. 
	The trial was intended to confirm that the injections did not damage the delicate light-sensing cells in the retina. 
	But the gene therapy had an unexpected therapeutic benefit - and three more patients have now been treated with a higher dose. 
	Professor Robert MacLaren of Oxford University, who led the trial, said: ""In truth we did not expect to see such dramatic improvements in visual acuity. 
	""It is still too early to know if the gene therapy treatment will last indefinitely, but we can say that the vision improvements have been maintained as long as we have been following up the patients, which is two years in one case."" 
	The patients were treated in one eye only so doctors could accurately assess the effects of treatment. Results are published in The Lancet medical journal. 
	Other, more common, genetic causes of blindness, including macular degeneration retinitis pigmentosa, could be treated using the same technique. 
	Jonathan Wyatt, 65, had his weaker left eye treated as part of the trial and began to notice an improvement in his vision within days. 
	""Now when I watch a football match on the TV, if I look at the screen with my left eye alone, it is as if someone has switched on the floodlights,"" he said. 
	""The green of the pitch is greener and the numbers on the shirts are much clearer."" 
	The new procedure involved detaching the retina at the back of the eye and then using a fine needle to inject the genetically modified virus underneath it. 
	The virus-infected light sensing cells delivered a working copy of the 'CHM' gene. A protein produced by the gene stops the cells dying off. 
	Professor MacLaren said: ""If we were able to treat people early, get them in their teens or late childhood, we'd be getting  the virus in before their vision is lost. 
	""If the treatment works, we would be able to prevent them from going blind."" 
	Wayne Thompson, 43, was treated in April with a higher gene therapy dose as part of a new trial. 
	He said: ""One night in the summer, my wife called me outside as it was a particularly starry evening. 
	As I looked up, I was amazed that I was able to see a few stars. I hadn't seen stars for a long, long time. 
	""For a long time I lived with the certainty of losing vision. Now I have uncertainty of whether the trial will work, but it is worth the risk."" 
	The trial was funded by the Health Innovation Challenge Fund, a partnership between the Wellcome Trust and the Department of Health. 
	Further funds were raised by the Tommy Salisbury Choroideremia Fund through the charity Fight for Sight. 
	Tommy, now 13, was diagnosed with the condition at the age of five. His family have raised £360,000 to fund research. 
	His mum Emma said: ""It's a mother's worst fear to know that your child has an eye condition that's currently incurable and will cause them to lose their sight.""

Blind Can Carry Guns In Public In Iowa"
2014-01-16,Cannabis Trade: 'More Money And A Better Life',https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140117003627/http://news.sky.com/story/1195350/cannabis-trade-more-money-and-a-better-life,"The recession in the UK lured many people into the cannabis trade. 
	Sky News was invited into one large-scale operation somewhere in south London where we met two British workers who dedicate their lives to this illegal horticulture. 
	Wearing a decorator's mask, track suit top and shorts, one worker gave us a guided tour, explaining how their operation works. 
	There are around 30 cannabis plants potted in tubs in one small room that is rigged up with several hot lights, there's gardening equipment in the hallway along with tens of thousands of pounds worth of the class B drug. 
	The worker said: ""I have been working here four years - I used to be a scaffolder. 
	""Obviously scaffolding is good money but I wanted a bit more money and a better life, so I got involved and started learning a new trade."" 
	Each plant is potentially worth tens of thousands of pounds to the gang. 
	After years of growing them and caring for them the worker said: ""They are like humans - they get ill, you have to use chemicals - you have to treat them when they get ill ... you have got to handle them like you do your own kids. 
	""It is a full-time job. When people say it is easy - it may be easy selling it, but is not easy growing it. It takes all my time up."" 
	The illicit factory is within a property adjoining another legitimate business. 
	The worker admitted: ""I'm on a really big scale of it, you know, there is even more stuff that you haven't seen. 
	""We have got places which are full up with stuff ... the money is excellent, really good. 
	""The way the economy is, we help the economy and we give people jobs."" 
	The gang revealed how they also operate a franchise system, preying on people who are ready to hire out a spare bedroom. 
	The worker said: ""What it is is people on benefits and that and they are struggling and we give 'em a bit of money to use two rooms or whatever we want. 
	""For one room we will give 'em £200 or £300 a month ... if it ever got caught by the police it is not in our name it is in their name and that's, that's what we do."" 
	The worker has seen how UK-produced cannabis has come to dominate the market for a drug that was once predominantly imported from abroad. 
	He said: ""It is that big they will never be able to control it - it is on a massive big scale what everyone is doing, it is not just us. 
	""The new trade now is people doing this instead of going to work ... it is hard work but it is easy money - right at the end of it is a nice payout."" 
	He then grabs a nearby black holdall and showed us the stash of cannabis, bagged up and ready to be sold on the street. 
	""These are ounces, they go for £250 - I do 'em at £200 - but if you broke them down into little bits into £20 shots you could earn about twenty grand from all this - maybe more."" 
	He had few qualms about this strong version of cannabis ending up in very young hands. 
	""Yeah young kids - I know 12, 13-year-olds smoking it, even 11-year-olds ... it mellows them out, makes you in a good mood and it is a nice little buzz."" 
	Before he returned to tending to his plants I asked if he would ever return to scaffolding, the worker simply replied: ""Never ... never.""

2014-01-16,Drug Gang 'Sells Cannabis To School Children',https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140117003627/http://news.sky.com/story/1195251/drug-gang-sells-cannabis-to-school-children,"By Tom Parmenter, Sky News Correspondent Sky News has gained exclusive access to a drugs gang that supplies primary school-aged children with cannabis. 
	The boss of the south London firm claims the cannabis trade in Britain is ""the biggest it has ever been"" despite continued police efforts to disrupt the illegal trade. 
	Speaking on condition of anonymity, the man in his twenties told Sky News he employs more than 30 workers. 
	He explained how they had at least three factories supplying people in south London and even claims he exports the class B drug to the Netherlands, Germany and Austria. 
	The boss said: ""We have a type of weed over here called 'English cheese'. 
	""It was created over here - in Amsterdam they don't have that so they try to create that but they just can't because it is what we make and that's what they want."" 
	But it is his claim that dealers are peddling drugs to primary school-aged children in London that will shock many parents. 
	He said: ""You've got doctors, police, solicitors, teachers, bus drivers - everyone does it .... young kids, school kids, even primary school kids."" 
	The gang leader said he personally does not sell to children, but admitted that dealers who work with his organisation do. 
	He said: ""I blame it on the TV, the media, rap, YouTube, like Miley Cyrus on TV it is a common thing - they see it as the cool thing to do. 
	""Instead of binge-drinking they'll go and have a smoke."" 
	The singer Miley Cyrus recently appeared to light up a joint while on stage at the European MTV awards in Amsterdam. 
	The drugs boss spoke to Sky News because he believes the cannabis trade in the UK should be legalised. 
	He said: ""It should be legal so we don't have to hide what we are doing. 
	""If you look at LA and California and how they legalised it for medical reasons and stuff and how the crime rate actually drops. 
	""They legalised and it's a calmer place out there."" 
	Commander Steve Rodhouse, who heads the Metropolitan Police's gangs and organised crime division, said the cannabis trade in the UK ""fuels crime, fuels violence and anti-social behaviour. This is a real problem on our streets"". 
	He also said some reports tend to give the impression that gangs can operate without fear of being detected. 
	""That is just not the case,"" he added. 
	""We do thousands and thousands of search warrants every year in London. We arrest and charge hundreds of people for this crime."" 
	The Home Office said over the last two years police forces have seized more than one million cannabis plants, keeping an estimated £200m worth of the drug off the streets. 
	The number of offences related to cannabis production rose from 14,982 in 2010/11 to 16,464 in 2011/12, according to the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO). 
	An ACPO spokeswoman said: ""Police forces and the National Crime Agency (NCA) are finding that these criminals are going to ever greater lengths to conceal their illicit activity because they know that across the country we are shutting down these farms on a daily basis."" 
	Crime Prevention Minister Norman Baker told Sky News: ""In the UK, cannabis is controlled as a class B drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 and is listed in Schedule 1 to the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001. 
	""Those who grow and supply cannabis face up to 14 years' imprisonment. Production of cannabis for personal use is also illegal. 
	""We are determined to bring the criminal gangs who trade in cannabis to justice. I am also leading a study of drugs policy in other countries, which will build on the commitment in the drug strategy to look at what we can learn from the approach taken abroad.""

2014-01-16,Fracking Cash Will Not Go Far For Councils,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140117003627/http://news.sky.com/story/1194272/fracking-cash-will-not-go-far-for-councils,"Amid the conflicting arguments on fracking, one thing is crystal clear. 
	The Government likes fracking. Really, really likes it. 
	David Cameron says they are going ""all out"" for shale gas schemes, which ministers say will create jobs, help the economy and reduce energy bills. 
	The problem is nobody wants the drilling in their own backyard. 
	The Government's solution is to offer ""rewards"" or ""bribes"" (depending on your standpoint) for councils who permit companies to drill exploratory wells. 
	Local authorities will be able to keep 100% of the business rates collected, rather than the current 50%. 
	There is growing scepticism, however, that this will make any difference. 
	The reward amounts to just £1.7m a year according to Whitehall officials. 
	To gauge the impact, it's worth looking at West Sussex County Council – an authority where fracking protests are going on. 
	The promised cash would barely make a dent in the council's annual budget of £535m. 
	And it wouldn't pay for recent initiatives such as resurfacing roads (£30m over two years) or rolling out fibre broadband (£20m). 
	If shale gas is discovered, local communities will also get 1% of the revenues. 
	But faced with angry protesters, councils may decide the price isn't right.

	PC Keith Wallis has pleaded guilty to misconduct in public office after falsely claiming to have witnessed the exchange between Andrew Mitchell and Toby Rowland in November 2012. 
	A serving police officer fabricating a witness statement is an incredibly serious offence and raises real questions about trust in the police. 
	At the centre of the row – are the two men at the Downing Street gates. 
	According to the police log leaked to the Sun newspaper, Andrew Mitchell described officers as ""plebs"". 
	Mr Mitchell denies this and has challenged PC Toby Rowland to repeat his account under oath. He admits swearing but says he did not use the word ""pleb"". 
	Meanwhile, PC Rowland is suing the former Chief Whip for libel. 
	But the story gets even more complicated. 
	Andrew Mitchell is also suing the Sun newspaper for printing the original claims, while the Police Federation is backing PC Rowland and giving him legal advice 
	Mr Mitchell has also accused Police Fed representatives of lying about what happened in a meeting in October 2012. 
	It led to the three officers being hauled in front of the Home Affairs Select Committee – where chairman Keith Vaz accused them of giving misleading evidence 
	The one person who isn't being sued and isn't under investigation is the man at the heart of the story, diplomatic protection officer PC Rowland. 
	Prosecutors have found there was insufficient evidence to charge PC Rowland with any criminal offence after the row, and Scotland Yard has said he will not face disciplinary action. 
	The rumbling row of Plebgate comes down to one man's word against another – it may prove impossible to find out definitively what was said at the Downing Street gates.

aged 69, according to his agent. 
	He was best known for his role in the long-running hit comedy series alongside David Jason as the dopey road-sweeper. 
	His agent, Maureen Vincent, said he had pancreatic cancer and had ""died at home surrounded by his family"". 
	Lloyd-Pack appeared in dozens of films and TV shows including Dr Who, and The Vicar Of Dibley. 
	His film roles included Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire. 
	Only Fools And Horses is due to return for a special one-off episode for Sport Relief in March. 
	It is believed the script has been written but it is not known if filming has begun. 
	The episode was due to feature Lloyd-Pack. 
	Lloyd-Pack was involved in one of the most memorable and classic scenes from the long-running comedy when he and Del Boy go to a wine bar. 
	Describing him as a fine actor, Sir David Jason said: ""I was very saddened to hear of Roger's passing. 
	""He was a very quiet, kind and unassuming actor who was a pleasure to work with. 
	""Although he played the simple soul of Trigger in Only Fools And Horses, he was a very intelligent man and a very fine actor capable of many roles. 
	""I shall remember him with fondness and for all the good times we had together."" 
	John Challis, best known as Boycie in Only Fools, said: ""I spoke to Roger two days ago. Roger said it was a bit awkward to talk at that particular moment. 
	""It is very sad and very distressing. 
	""My thoughts are with his family. He was a remarkable man and he'll be missed. Roger is irreplaceable. It's a very sorry day."" 
	Lloyd-Pack was born in 1944 into an acting family in north London, and his father Charles was a regular in Hammer horror films. 
	The father of four was also a successful stage actor, appearing regularly at Shakespeare's Globe in central London, but acknowledged that he would always be best known as Trigger. 
	His daughter Emily Lloyd is an actress best known for her appearances in Wish You Were Here, In Country and A River Runs Through It. 
	The actor, who was fluent in German, Italian, and French, was also politically active and a prominent campaigner for left-wing causes. 
	An avid supporter of Tottenham Hotspur, he sometimes gave interviews on the touchline at White Hart Lane. 
	The club tweeted: ""We're saddened to learn of the death of Spurs fan Roger Lloyd-Pack. The Club extends our condolences to his friends and family."" 
	Lloyd-Pack's daughter Emily shot to fame in the 1987 film Wish You Were Here before stepping back from the celebrity limelight after struggling with health issues."

	The investigation has been going on for two years into what has been described as a ""significant and emerging threat"". 
	Three other investigations are taking place into live streaming of child sex abuse, with the Britons among 733 suspects. 
	Some 17 British suspects have already been arrested as part of Operation Endeavour, which involves police forces in Australia and the US and spans 12 countries. 
	Five of these suspects have been convicted, nine investigations are ongoing, one will face no further action and two are deceased. 
	The National Crime Agency operation began after police analysed the computer of convicted sex offender Timothy Ford, 52, from Kettering. 
	Detectives discovered Ford had been paying a family in the Philippines to force young boys to perform sex acts in front of a webcam before he shared the videos with other paedophiles over the internet. 
	The inquiry led to Thomas Owen, 33, from the Wirral, who was discovered to have been paying another Philippine family for their seven-year-old son to be abused for his sexual gratification. 
	Owen was later jailed for seven years for possessing more than three million indecent images of children and thousands of similar videos - the largest child-abuse collection ever uncovered in the UK. 
	Andy Baker from the National Crime Agency said: ""This investigation has identified some extremely dangerous child sexual offenders who believed paying for children to be abused to order was something they could get away with. 
	""Being thousands of miles away makes no difference to their guilt. In my mind they are just as responsible for the abuse of these children as the contact abusers overseas. 
	""Protecting the victims of abuse is our priority and that means attacking every link in the chain, from dismantling the organised groups who are motivated by profit through to targeting their customers."" 
	The National Crime Agency said: ""The use of webcams to stream live abuse, particularly from the developing world, is a significant and emerging threat according to our CEOP (Child Exploitation and Online Protection) command. 
	""Extreme poverty, the increasing availability of high-speed internet and the existence of a vast and comparatively wealthy overseas customer base has led to organised crime groups exploiting children for financial gain."" 
	Police have so far rescued 15 children aged six to 15 who have been identified as victims in the videos - in some cases after their relatives sold them for abuse.

2014-01-16,House Prices 'Risk Becoming Unsustainable',https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140117003627/http://news.sky.com/story/1195932/house-prices-risk-becoming-unsustainable,"Surveyors have warned that house prices risk becoming unsustainable in some areas because low home supply is failing to meet high demand in the market. 
	The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) measured the strongest level of sales in six years ahead of Christmas. 
	Its report predicts prices will rise by 5% on average in each of the next five years but warns that a lack of properties for sale risks people paying far more than market value to secure a home. 
	Its survey found around 21 property sales were made per surveyor in the three months to December, the highest average seen since spring 2008 and more than double the rate of a low point in January 2009 when fewer than 10 sales had been made per surveyor in the preceding three months. 
	Rics' latest housing market report said that during December, a net balance of 56% more surveyors reported prices rising rather than falling. 
	Every area of the UK saw prices increase, with London and the South East experiencing the biggest upward trend. 
	Surveyors predict that both sales and values will continue to move firmly upwards through 2014. 
	The general view was that this will largely be driven by lenders relaxing their borrowing conditions, resulting in them becoming more willing to lend to home buyers with low deposits, as well as an ongoing imbalance in the housing market as demand for homes continues to outstrip supply. 
	The report said that the property recovery was continuing ""full steam ahead"", with an upbeat outlook for property prices now visible in areas such as Northern Ireland, which has seen prices start to stabilise in recent months. 
	A new phase of the Government's Help to Buy scheme offering state-backed mortgages to people with 5% deposits was launched in October. 
	Figures released by the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) on Wednesday showed that the number of home loans handed out to first-time buyers was at a six-year high in November. 
	The CML also expected to see continued growth in mortgage lending in 2014. 
	Some housing market experts have urged stronger action to inject a fresh supply of homes to keep up with growing demand in the market and ease the upward pressure that the current imbalance is having on house prices. 
	Peter Bolton King, Rics global residential director, said: ""The housing market is starting to thrive once more. 
	""Sales are at their highest level in almost six years and this is being reflected right across the UK. 
	""Growing availability of affordable mortgages has released some pent-up demand from a market that, in recent years, has seen many viable buyers unable to enter the market. 
	""On the face of it, this seems like good news but unless we see a marked increase in the number of homes coming up for sale we could well be looking at price rises becoming unsustainable in some areas."" 
	As sales have picked up amid blossoming confidence in the housing market, surveyors also reported a slowing demand for rented homes. 
	But they also said that the shortage of homes generally would continue to push rents higher, with annual increases of around 4% expected for each of the next five years.

	Carla White told Cambridge Crown Court that Gary Stretch, 47, had explained that Joanna Dennehy ""would ****ing kill"" Kevin Lee because he owed her money. 
	Mr Lee, 48, is one of three men whose bodies were found dumped in ditches in Cambridgeshire in March and April last year. 
	The others were Lukasz Slaboszewski, 31, and John Chapman, 56. Dennehy, 31, admitted stabbing the three men during a hearing at the Old Bailey in November. 
	Stretch, real name Gary Richards, has denied three charges of preventing the lawful burial of the men and two counts of attempted murder. 
	Ms White, who had just begun sharing a house with Stretch in Riseholme, Orton Goldhay, Peterborough, told the court about the first time she met Dennehy, also known as Star because of a tattoo on her face. 
	""She was very rude, very arrogant,"" she said. 
	""I introduced myself to her, shook her hand and she told me to 'eff off' and she didn't want anything to do with me. 
	""I'm a bit feisty so I got in her face a bit."" 
	Ms White told the court that Dennehy put her hand around her throat. 
	""I had a hammer nearby so I held the hammer out,"" she said. 
	""She proceeded to let go of my throat and apologised."" 
	Ms White said Mr Lee had witnessed the incident but did not react. 
	""He seemed to follow her around a bit like a lapdog,"" she said. 
	Within days, Mr Lee was dead. 
	The court also heard from Kieran James, who was cycling home at around 11.15pm when he spotted Gary Stretch emerging from Dennehy's home in Bifield, Orton Goldhay, carrying a bag in his arms. 
	Mr James said: ""It was bigger than your average black bin bag ... It seemed fairly heavy."" 
	He told the jury that as the bag was put in the boot of a car ""the suspension went down on the vehicle"" and ""there were some other black carrier bags and bin liners"" already in there. 
	He told police this happened on March 29, the day John Chapman and Kevin Lee are both thought to have been killed. 
	Dennehy also pleaded guilty to two charges of attempted murder after violent attacks on two strangers in Hereford on April 2. 
	Stretch, who is 7'3"", is accused of driving around looking for victims with her. 
	Another defendant, Leslie Layton, 36, of Orton Goldhay, denies perverting the course of justice and two counts of preventing the lawful burial of two bodies.

	The note in question bears the portrait of the first bank governor, Sir John Houblon, who took office in 1694. 
	From April 30, only the £50 note which celebrates the 18th century business partnership of entrepreneur Matthew Boulton and engineer James Watt, who helped forge the Industrial Revolution, will hold legal tender status. 
	Victoria Cleland, head of notes division at the bank, said: ""If you have any Houblon £50 notes, it's best to spend, deposit or exchange them before April 30."" 
	Around 224 million £50 notes worth £11.2bn are in circulation in total. 
	The bank said that from May onwards, retailers were unlikely to accept the Houblon notes as payment, but most banks and building societies would still allow customers to deposit them into their accounts. 
	Barclays, NatWest, Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), Ulster Bank and the Post Office have agreed to exchange the older-style £50 notes for both customers and non-customers up to the value of £200 until October 30. 
	The Boulton and Watt note, which was brought into circulation in November 2011, was the first introduced by the bank to feature a green ""motion thread"" to bolster the currency's defences against counterfeiters. 
	It has five windows featuring the pound symbol and the number 50, which move up and down when the note is tilted from side to side. 
	In December, the Bank announced that it planned to issue plastic banknotes for the first time from 2016, when a new £5 note featuring Sir Winston Churchill appears. 
	A £10 note featuring Jane Austen will follow around a year later and also be made from polymer, rather than the cotton paper currently used, aimed at improving durability.

	The Liberal Democrat peer’s legal adviser said that there was no reason he should apologise to the women because he had been found guilty of nothing. 
	The Deputy Prime Minister repeated his call for Lord Rennard to apologise and said it was a matter of ""real regret"" that he had not done so already. 
	One of the women who has complained of her treatment at the hands of the former Liberal Democrat chief executive, Oxford University lecturer Alison Smith said that ""hell would freeze over"" before he said sorry. 
	On Wednesday, another of the women, Alison Goldsworthy, expressed frustration with the party's response and said: ""Faced with the opportunity to take strong action, the Liberal Democrats have once more opted for cowardice."" 
	The barrister leading the Liberal Democrat inquiry into the claims said that the evidence against Lord Rennard was not enough to prove the allegations beyond reasonable doubt – the threshold to trigger a party disciplinary hearing. 
	However, Anthony Webster QC, said that he found the evidence of the women ""credible"", that ""Lord Rennard's behaviour had caused distress to a number of women"" and that he should reflect upon his behaviour and apologise. 
	Lord Rennard's adviser and fellow Liberal Democrat peer Lord Carlile, said the QC has been wrong to call for an apology and when asked if one would be forthcoming he said: ""No, because there's no reason why he should because he has denied these allegations which have not been tried. Alistair Webster should not have said that."" 
	He told Radio 4's Today programme that neither he nor Lord Rennard has been allowed to see the full report by Mr Webster, condemning it as ""secret justice"". 
	The Metropolitan Police announced in September that no charges would be brought against the peer. 
	Speaking on his LBC radio show Call Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister said: ""He should apologise, it's not just me saying that. 
	""The QC - an independent judge - looked into this and he said there wasn't enough evidence for him to recommend action but he felt the women were speaking with credibility and should be believed and that Lord Rennard should think on his behaviour and apologise. 
	""It is a matter of great regret - to put it mildly - that he hasn't."" 
	He admitted that the party had failed to properly address the women’s claims and that the ""buck stopped"" with him as leader. He reiterated that Lord Rennard would have nothing to do with his campaign for the 2015 election. 
	In a statement on Wednesday Lord Rennard, who stepped down from his role as chief executive in 2009 on health grounds, said: ""I now look forward to resuming my roles within the Liberal Democrats. I remain committed to the same values which made me join the Liberal Party as a teenager more than 40 years ago."" 
	The peer has rejoined the Lib Dem group in the House of Lords and will return to his duties as an elected member of a key policy committee.

	Stewart and Natasha Sutherland, from Trench, Telford, took Keane, aged six, Sian, 13, and Rhiannon, 15, on a week-long break to Greece. 
	The couple said they booked the trip to Rhodes in October 2012, before new legislation banning schools from allowing 10 days leave for family holidays was introduced last year. 
	Telford Magistrates' Court heard they had not been given authorisation by two schools to take the children out of classes during the trip last September. 
	The couple had originally refused to pay a £360 penalty, which authorities then doubled to £720 because it was not paid within 21 days. 
	They said they had booked the trip in term time because they had not been able to get leave together during the school holidays for five years. 
	They denied it was because they wanted a cheaper break. 
	Claiming the family needed to spend time together on holiday to address problems being experienced by one of his children, Mr Sutherland said: ""I feel that I am being treated like a criminal and being punished because I am trying to do the best for my family. 
	""It's like being taxed because I am a shift worker. I had to take everybody as a family to get us back on track, which is what I have done."" 
	The pair admitted failing to ensure their children attended school regularly between September 4 and October 25 last year. 
	Speaking after the hearing at Telford Magistrates' Court in Shropshire, the father-of-three described newly-tightened regulations governing pupils' absence for holidays as a farce. 
	The 39-year-old, who works as a Ministry of Defence guard, said: ""The people who make these laws and policies don't live in the real world."" 
	Telford & Wrekin Council said the new legislation was clear. Head teachers can now only give pupils leave in term time in ""exceptional circumstances"", because they say ""significant absence"" can be ""disruptive"" to how well children do at school. 
	""The decision to not authorise an absence request from parents during term is taken by a school or an academy and not the council. The school or academy will then instruct the council to issue the fine notice and legally this has to be done by the council. 
	""If the fine is not paid the council must take further legal steps, as it has in this case."" 
	A Department for Education spokesman said: ""Poor attendance at school can have a hugely damaging effect, and children who attend school regularly are nearly four times more likely to achieve five or more good GCSEs than those who are regularly absent. 
	""That is why we have given schools more power to tackle poor attendance and allowed them to intervene much earlier. We have also increased the amount parents can be fined for unauthorised absences and cut the amount of time they have to pay. 
	""Parents should never simply discount a possible penalty notice from the cost of a cheaper holiday, because this is a criminal offence and when doing so they are always risking prosecution."" 
	The husband and wife were also ordered to pay £300 in costs and a £63 victim surcharge.

	Robert Gates said the UK was losing its ""full spectrum"" ability to fight on land, sea and air, and significant reductions in the UK's military capacity would threaten its global position. 
	He cautioned that the cuts to the Royal Navy were of particular concern, pointing out that Britain does not have an operational aircraft carrier for the first time since the First World War. 
	Mr Gates, who served under both Barack Obama and George Bush, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""With the fairly substantial reductions in defence spending in Great Britain, what we're finding is that it won't have full spectrum capabilities and the ability to be a full partner as they have been in the past."" 
	He said he ""lamented"" the defence cuts in both the US and the UK, and said it was very important that Western powers continued to have significant military strength and power. 
	Mr Gates warned that tensions in the Middle East and Asia were rising and the world was becoming increasingly dangerous. 
	He also urged the UK, which has the fourth biggest defence budget in the world, but the eighth biggest economy, to continue with its Trident nuclear programme. 
	But David Cameron responded fiercely to the comments during a visit to the Crossrail project in London. He said: ""I don't agree with him. I think he has got it wrong. 
	""We have the fourth largest defence budget anywhere in the world. We are investing in future capabilities. 
	""We are a first-class player in terms of defence, and as long as I am Prime Minster that is the way it will stay."" 
	Last month the Chief of the Defence Staff, General Sir Nicholas Houghton, warned the military was at risk of becoming a ""hollow force"", possessing equipment, but having no one to operate it. 
	Speaking at a Royal United Services Institute event, he said the Royal Navy was ""perilously close to its critical mass in manpower terms"". 
	The Government is planning significant cuts to the armed forces with regular Army troops reduced by 20,000 to 82,000 by 2020. In the Royal Navy, 6,000 posts will go, while 5,000 will be lost in the Royal Air Force. 
	A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ""Like the United States, the UK has had to take tough decisions on defence spending, but we still have the fourth-largest defence budget in the world and the best-trained and best-equipped armed forces outside the US. 
	""Over the next decade, we plan to spend £160bn on equipment, to ensure our armed forces retain their formidable range of cutting-edge capabilities and ability to project power across the globe, including by maintaining our major naval presence in the Gulf region. 
	""Construction of the first new aircraft carrier, the largest ship the Royal Navy has ever operated, is almost complete and the navy will also operate state-of-the-art Type 45 destroyers, new Type 26 frigates and seven new Astute class submarines.""

	A debate on the issues surrounding nuisance calls will take place in the House of Commons today. 
	It will be led by Liberal Democrat Mike Crockart, who is campaigning to curb the practice of cold calling. 
	MPs will push the Government to take action on the way consent is given and used, getting the industry itself to act responsibly to protect vulnerable consumers. 
	Research from Citizens Advice last year found people were being harassed by cold calls for a range of products and services. 
	According to a survey of 5,682 British adults aged 18 and over, the most common unexpected sales calls, texts and emails made to households in Britain are: 
	:: Personal injury and accident claims (42%) 
	:: Gas and electricity suppliers (40%) 
	:: Double glazing firms (29%) 
	:: Firms selling debt relief services (23%) 
	:: Offers for extended warranty on products (14%) 
	:: Firms selling pension unlocking services (10%) 
	Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: ""It is time companies hang-up marketing plans that bombard people with unwanted phone calls, text messages and automated voicemails. 
	""I'd like to see financial service companies banned from cold calling. A ban on these firms would help people know a call out of the blue is one not to be trusted."""
2014-01-25,Hidden Camera Pen Catches Thief Red-Handed,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140125095110/http://news.sky.com/story/1200678/hidden-camera-pen-catches-thief-red-handed,"A carer has been jailed after a surveillance camera hidden in a pen caught her stealing thousands of pounds from an elderly couple. 
	Lisa Mitchell, 38, helped herself to £35,000 in cash over four years when she worked for 81-year-old Sheila Read, who had dementia, at their home in Dereham, Norfolk. 
	But the couple's son, Allan Read, suspected money was disappearing so he set up the secret CCTV camera in the pen and strategically placed it in an office in the house, Norfolk Police said. 
	Mitchell was filmed on two occasions in the office, which she had no reason to be in. 
	The footage showed her going through a desk and the elderly man's wallet. 
	Allan Read had made a note of serial numbers on the bank notes, which police used along with the images to prove the offence. 
	Mitchell, of Masefield Mews, Dereham, pleaded guilty to theft and was jailed for 18 months at Norwich Crown Court. 
	Detective Constable Gemma Weeks said Mitchell used the stolen cash to buy jewellery and designer handbags. 
	""Over four years Lisa Mitchell took advantage of an elderly couple whom she was trusted to care for,"" she said. 
	""She thought nothing of helping herself to their personal money and cash from their family business, which she spent on jewellery and designer handbags. 
	""Even when presented with CCTV evidence, Mitchell denied stealing from this vulnerable couple, and could not account for living beyond her means. 
	""Over and above the financial impact of her crime is the emotional one, particularly when it appeared that Mitchell was searching for money instead of caring for the elderly lady.""

2014-01-25,Balls Commits To Balancing The Nation's Books,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140125095110/http://news.sky.com/story/1200707/balls-commits-to-balancing-the-nations-books,"Shadow chancellor Ed Balls is promising to balance the nation's books, run a budget surplus and cut the national debt if Labour win power. 
	In a speech to the Fabian Society Annual Conference today, Mr Balls will make a raft of commitments on the economy and public finances. 
	New laws introducing tough fiscal rules would be introduced during the party's first year in power and rolling five-year targets scrapped under Labour's plans. 
	The party is seeking to regain ground on the economy by demonstrating its fiscal discipline following growth forecasts that are favourable for the coalition Government. 
	The move echoes Chancellor George Osborne's plans to lock in deficit-reduction plans until the end of the next parliament. 
	But Labour insists the timescale for its commitment is dependent on the state of the economy after the election. 
	Mr Balls will say: ""I am today announcing a binding fiscal commitment. 
	""The next Labour government will balance the books and deliver a surplus on the current budget and falling national debt in the next Parliament.  
	""So my message to my party and the country is this: where this government has failed, we will finish the job. 
	""We will abolish the discredited idea of rolling five year targets and legislate for our tough fiscal rules within 12 months of the general election. 
	""We will get the current budget into surplus as soon as possible in the next Parliament. How fast we can go will depend on the state of the economy and public finances we inherit."" 
	Mr Balls' bid to bolster Labour's economic position will see him repeat his claim that coalition austerity has flatlined the economy and spurred the cost of living crisis. 
	Mr Balls will say: ""Tory claims their plan is working are not going to wash with working people who are seeing their living standards falling and for whom this is no recovery at all. 
	""Because the current cost-of-living crisis is not just about people on tax credits, zero-hours contracts and the minimum wage. It's also about millions of middle-class families who never thought that life would be such a struggle."" 
	Andrew Harrop, general secretary of the Fabian Society, said: ""Labour needs to prove it has cast-iron plans to reduce the national debt when it returns to power. But the top priority for sustainable economic growth is investment. 
	""Ed Balls needs to show that his fiscal plans will not prevent Labour spending for the future."" 
	Sky's Sophy Ridge said: ""What he's going to do today is set out a timetable for when Labour want to try and eliminate the deficit by. 
	""He will say he will bring Britain back into the black by 2020 if there's a Labour government after the next election. That's a year later than George Osborne has currently committed to. 
	""It's all about Labour trying to regain voters trust on the economy.""

2014-01-25,Twitter Trolls Jailed For Sending Abusive Tweets,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140125095110/http://news.sky.com/story/1200521/twitter-trolls-jailed-for-sending-abusive-tweets,"By Nick Pisa, Sky News Reporter Two people who sent abusive and menacing tweets to banknote campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez and Labour MP Stella Creasy have been jailed. 
	Isabella Sorley, 23, and John Nimmo, 25, posted dozens of abusive tweets against both women before they were arrested. 
	Senior district judge Howard Riddle jailed Sorley for 12 weeks and Nimmo for eight weeks as well as ordering them to pay £400 compensation to each victim. 
	Earlier this month the pair pleaded guilty to sending the menacing tweets, admitting they were among the users of 86 separate Twitter accounts from which Ms Criado-Perez had received abusive messages. 
	Passing sentence at Westminster Magistrates Court, Judge Riddle said that both victims had suffered substantially as a result of the abuse. 
	He said Ms Criado-Perez had faced ""panic, fear and horror"" adding that she feared the ""abusers would find her and carry out the threats. She felt hunted."" 
	She responded to the sentencing on Twitter, saying: ""I feel immensely relieved that the judge clearly has understood the severity of the impact this abuse has had on me."" She said the compensation would be given to charity. 
	Of Ms Creasy the judge said: ""She became concerned for her safety to the extent that she had to alter her behaviour. She had a panic button installed in her home."" 
	As he passed sentence Sorley shook her head and looked to the floor while Nimmo stared straight ahead, showing no emotion. 
	Sean Caulfield, defending Sorley, told the court his client was ""articulate and intelligent"" and there was ""disconnect"" between her and the person that sent the messages. 
	He said they were sent in a half-hour window between 2.25am and 2.55am last July 30 when she was under the influence of alcohol and she was ""horrified and appalled"" at what she had done. 
	The court also heard how she had 25 previous convictions, mostly for being drunk and disorderly but she had also been convicted twice of assaulting police. 
	At the time of the Twitter abuse last summer Ms Criado-Perez was leading an ultimately successful campaign to have women featured on British banknotes. 
	Police launched an investigation after both she and Walthamstow MP Ms Creasy complained about the vile tweets. 
	Sorley used Twitter to tell Ms Criado-Perez to ""f*** off and die you worthless piece of crap"", ""go kill yourself"" and ""rape is the last of your worries"". 
	She also deluged Ms Criado-Perez with menacing messages claiming that she had just been released from prison, writing: ""I will find you and you don’t want to know what I will do when I do, you’re pathetic, kill yourself before I do."" 
	Sorley, from Newcastle upon Tyne, has a 2:1 degree in creative advertising from Leeds College of Art and was working in an Asda supermarket in Newcastle at the time. She has since lost her job. 
	Unemployed Nimmo told Ms Criado-Perez to ""shut up bitch"" and ""Ya not that gd looking to rape u be fine"" followed by ""I will find you (smiley face)"". 
	In an attack on Ms Creasy, Nimmo, from South Shields, said:""The things I cud do to u (smiley face)"", calling her ""Dumb blond bitch."" 
	Ms Creasy responded to Nimmo's message of ""Dumb blonde bitch"" with the message ""That's dumb Dr blonde bitch to you"". 
	""Love it at least u can have a laugh,"" Nimmo responded, to which Ms Creasy said: ""I'm not having a laugh, I'm cataloguing your vile conduct #takebacktwitter"". 
	In court his solicitor Paul Kennedy described him as a ""recluse and sad individual"" adding that he had no previous convictions and was sorry for what he did. 
	Sorley's brother, who was in court with two holdalls carrying her belongings in the hope his sister would not be jailed, left without making any comment. 
	Before the early hearing, Sorley posted a picture of herself on her Twitter page posing outside Buckingham Palace with the message ""just chilling at the queens"".

	Nida Ul-Naseer has not been seen since December 28, when she left her home in Newport, South Wales, to take out the rubbish. 
	Concerns for her safety continue to mount as the student was not wearing shoes when she disappeared from her home in Linton Street. 
	She also did not have her phone, money or coat when she vanished. 
	There has been an extensive search by police for the missing teen, and repeated appeals. 
	In the latest plea, two separate video clips have been posted on Gwent Police's YouTube channel from her father, mother, and sister Shamyla. 
	Her father said: ""We are very worried about Nida. If anyone knows about Nida tell us. We just want her to come back."" 
	In her 56-second appeal, Shamyla, 23, sitting next to her tearful mother, said: ""Nida, if you are listening to me please come back home. 
	""We all worry about you Nida. We all love you Nida. 
	""You don't have to worry about anything. We are here for you."" 
	Nida's family, who are originally from Pakistan, have been seeking asylum in Britain, but their application was turned down last year. They are appealing the decision. 
	On the night she disappeared Nida had been angry and upset that she could not go to university because her family are asylum seekers. Shamyla said she was ""shouting and crying"". 
	Police have described her disappearance as a ""mystery"". 
	Superintendent Mark Warrender said: ""We are continuing to search CCTV and to look into any information that comes in, but we really haven't had anything that would lead us to the positive identification of Nida. 
	""We are keeping an open mind."" 
	Nida is described as five feet three inches tall, and was last seen wearing blue jeans and a black top. 
	Her family has repeatedly denied claims that the teenager had run off with a secret boyfriend or that she was due to be involved in an arranged marriage. 
	Anyone with information is urged to contact police on 101.

	Travis, 68, told officers from Operation Yewtree what he knew of the disgraced and now dead fellow broadcaster, when he was questioned during the inquiry against him. 
	He said he had thought ""good luck to him"", regarding Savile's attitude to young girls but did not realise they were under-age. 
	The jury at Southwark Crown Court heard Prosecutor Teresa Hay read out statements Travis made in a series of four interviews with police from November 2012 to September last year. 
	He was questioned by Metropolitan Police Detective Sergeant Gary Pankhurst, of Operation Yewtree, which is investigating Savile and others linked with him or independent of him. 
	Ms Hay said that in his statement, Travis said: ""I saw Savile once or twice a year but I didn't know him. He put up a verbal wall, no one got any sense out of him and I never had a full conversation with him. 
	""We didn't keep in touch, he was a colleague but not a friend. People knew he liked young girls but not below the official age, when it came out, like others I was horrified. 
	""If had known I would have reported him. I was genuinely shocked."" 
	In all his interviews Travis, who is appearing in court under his real name David Griffin, denied the allegations against him insisting they were ""made up for money"" although he admitted he could be tactile at times. 
	He said he would have been ""insane"" and a ""complete moron"" to assault his victims in the BBC studios as has been claimed earlier in the trial, adding that people in his industry ""were now targets"". 
	He told police he had been through ""three months of hell"" after the allegations were first made and asked why his victims had gone to the papers first and not the police, telling officers ""it's a money grabbing culture"". 
	Ms Hay said that in another interview Travis again strenuously denied all the allegations and said: ""Stuff went on in the 70s, it was a different time. I didn't do drugs, unlike others back then, I'm scared of drugs. I'm no angel but this is just not on."" 
	He told police he had a ""rock solid marriage"" and added that he ""very young girls were not him."" Of one allegation from a then 15-year-old girl he is accused of indecently assaulting in a trailer, he said: ""She has an active imagination."" 
	As the statements were read out Travis, sat in the dock, dressed in a blazer, white shirt and tie followed closely a copy that he had in his hands. 
	He denies 13 charges of indecent assault between 1976 and 2003 and a charge of sexual assault in 2008. 
	The trial at Southwark Crown Court continues with his defence due to begin on Monday.

2014-01-25,Older Cancer Patients Are Being 'Written Off',https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140125095110/http://news.sky.com/story/1200147/older-cancer-patients-are-being-written-off,"Some patients with cancer are being denied treatment because they are too old, according to charity Macmillan Cancer Support. 
	Elderly patients are being ""written off"" for treatment after being assessed on age rather than fitness, claimed the charity. 
	The claim comes despite research showing tens of thousands of pensioners have survived the disease for 10 years or more. 
	""It's wrong to write off older people as too old for treatment,"" said Macmillan chief executive Ciaran Devane. 
	""With a proper assessment and appropriate treatment, our research shows that many older cancer patients can live for a long time and can even be cured. 
	""While it's good news that so many older people are benefiting from treatment, many thousands more could live longer if our survival rates for over-65s matched those in comparable countries. 
	""The barriers to getting treatment - which include age discrimination and inadequate assessment methods - must be tackled now so older people can survive cancer and live for many years."" 
	For cancers such as prostate, breast, lung, stomach, ovary and kidney, the UK and Ireland have a lower five-year survival rate than the rest of Europe, a spokesman said. 
	At least 130,000 patients in the UK have survived for at least 10 years after being diagnosed with cancer at the age of 65 or above, including more than 8,000 patients diagnosed at age 80 or over. 
	Dr Mark Porter, chairman of council at the British Medical Association, said: ""It is important that all healthcare professionals ensure that patients are treated on the basis of their clinical need. 
	""With an increasingly ageing population, it should be a key part of medical professionalism to guarantee that older patients are treated with the care and respect they deserve."" 
	Sean Duffy, national clinical director for cancer at NHS England, said: ""We need to deliver better services for people over 65 and 75 because we know there's an issue and interventions need to be designed to that end.""

	Lib Dem-led Portsmouth City Council, where Mr Hancock is a councillor, opposed the application for full disclosure of the report. 
	But Master Leslie, a High Court official, ruled disclosure was necessary so that the woman could feel she had ""a fair hearing and a fair crack of the whip"". 
	The report was written by Nigel Pascoe QC, who was asked by the council to investigate the allegations for code of conduct proceedings. 
	The woman, a female constituent and a young mother, says Mr Hancock made ""unwelcome sexual approaches"". 
	Mr Hancock, MP for Portsmouth South, denies the allegations. Police investigated but said no further action should be taken. 
	However, a leaked, redacted version of the report describes the account she gave as ""credible"". 
	Mr Hancock, 67, from Fareham, Hampshire, was suspended from the Liberal Democrats on Wednesday and currently sits as an independent MP. 
	Following a private meeting this evening, Portsmouth City Council's Liberal Democrat group said Mr Hancock would retain his seat on the council's cabinet. 
	""This was decided because councillor Hancock is best placed to fulfil the role of cabinet member for planning, regeneration and economic development,"" the group said in a statement. 
	It went on: ""Councillor Mike Hancock no longer remains a member of the Portsmouth City Council Liberal Democrat Group because, having had his membership suspended by the party at national level, it is not possible for him to remain a member of the city council group until the suspension is lifted. 
	""The group acknowledges that the suspension has been imposed before the issue to which suspension relates has been properly and fairly determined through due process in the courts. 
	""The group decided that the Independent councillor Mike Hancock should retain his seat on the cabinet of the City Council."" 
	In Mr Pascoe's leaked report the woman is referred to as Annie which is not her real name. 
	He says: ""Making full allowances for the disclosed mental history of (Annie), I have no doubt that she has provided before me compelling prima facie evidence of serious and unwelcome sexual behaviour towards her by Mr Hancock."" 
	Outside court, the woman's solicitor, Harriet Wistrich, welcomed the master's ruling. 
	Ms Wistrich said: ""She will be very pleased that the judge has seen this is relevant. She has had to overcome a lot of barriers."" 
	If her client won, she could expect to receive compensation ranging between £5,000 and £30,000  ""depending on the psychiatric damage and losses, including loss of earnings, she has suffered - it is an open-ended question"". 
	Ms Wistrich added: ""From her point of view, she wants recognition that she has been wronged and that these events did take place."" 
	Mr Hancock said after the ruling: ""I'm sorry I'm not commenting on anything."" 
	Earlier, Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg has said he was ""appalled"" when he learned about the allegations insisted he had acted as swiftly as he could and was only made aware of the ""specific allegations"" at the beginning of last year for the first time. 
	Mr Hancock was suspended by the party on Wednesday after the report was leaked on the internet. 
	The latest legal moves come in a week when the party has also been rocked by complaints of inappropriate behaviour by Lord Rennard, the party's former chief executive, which he denies.

2014-01-25,Philpott Fire Killings 'Could Not Be Predicted',https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140125095110/http://news.sky.com/story/1200114/philpott-fire-killings-could-not-be-predicted,"By Adele Robinson, Midlands Correspondent The six Philpott children killed in a house fire started by their parents were victims of ""a criminal act no one could have predicted"", according to a Serious Case Review. 
	The Derby Safeguarding Children Board concluded that their deaths could not have been prevented. 
	Mick and Mairead Philpott and their friend Paul Mosley were convicted of manslaughter and jailed last year. 
	Jade Philpott and her brothers John, Jack, Jesse, Jayden and Duwayne died after their home was set alight in May 2012. 
	A statement from the board said their ""tragic"" deaths could not have been foreseen. 
	""Given the notoriety of the father, the incidents of domestic abuse and visibility of the children, there were some opportunities to get to know the family better, although this would not have led to professionals becoming aware that there were plans to deliberately set fire to the house when the children were sleeping."" 
	Mick Philpott lived for some time with his wife and former mistress, along with their 11 children. 
	The review found that the living arrangements at Victory Road were ""unorthodox"" but stated: ""Although professionals recognised the arrangements as unusual they did not appear to affect the children and there was no evidence of difficulties between the adults."" 
	The report considered a number of issues relating to the children including adult relationships, overcrowding at the house, Mick Philpott's previous convictions, domestic abuse, and media coverage. 
	""There were not concerns about the care of the children,"" report author Glenys Johnston told Sky News. 
	""In fact the children presented as happy, healthy, who formed good relationships with others around them. 
	""They were not malnourished, there were no concerns about the welfare of the children."" 
	In 2005 and 2006, Sure Start staff ""commented positively on the family atmosphere and the father's engagement with his children"". 
	In 2011, after one child told school staff she had been slapped at home, investigations found the ""family continued to appear well adjusted and happy"". 
	The report highlighted areas for improvement, however, including the sharing of information of past convictions going back decades. 
	Several agencies did not know of Mick Philpott's violent past, a conviction for attempted murder on an ex-girlfriend in 1978. 
	Workload pressures also meant more thorough checks on the children's files did not happen. 
	There were also opportunities to get to know the family better due to Mick Philpott's notoriety and various incidents of domestic abuse. 
	The report stated: ""Information that has emerged after the deaths of the children have described some tensions between the father and the women who lived in the house due to his controlling manner, but this was not apparent at the time. 
	""The relationship between the two mothers was always viewed as supportive and caring with neither of them having any difficulty with the partnership arrangements or any jealousy."" 
	Derbyshire Fire and Rescue advice forms part of the review's 10 recommendations, for example continuing to encourage the installation of sprinklers into new houses. 
	As a result of the Philpott children's deaths research was carried out by the service into why they did not hear the smoke alarms. 
	Area manager Gavin Tomlinson, said: ""Obviously children are developing their hearing at a younger age and they may not be woken by the smoke alarm. 
	""That said, the smoke alarm is there to alert all occupants and obviously there will be responsible people in the house - adults with children."" 
	Mick Philpott was handed a life sentence with a minimum term of 15 years after being described as a ""disturbingly dangerous"" man. 
	His wife, who is likely to be released after serving half of her 17-year term, took part as part of a plan to frame his former mistress who had left the family. 
	Their friend Paul Mosley was also jailed for 17 years.

	Laszlo Gyarmati, from Hungary, was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 17 years for the killing of Alexandra Kovacs. 
	CCTV footage of Gyarmati showed him leaving Miss Kovacs' property on July 18 last year with a large suitcase containing her body. 
	He wheeled the suitcase to Dollis Valley Greenwalk footpath, in Barnet, north London, and dumped it near some bushes. 
	The court heard that the night before, the pair had gone to get some fast food in Hendon, north London. 
	Neighbours later told police they had heard a woman scream and call for help in the early hours of the morning. 
	A member of the public found Ms Kovacs' body on the same day and asked a friend to report it. However a police search of the riverside walk failed to find anything. 
	It was not until three days later, after a missing person report was filed and blood stains discovered in Miss Kovacs' property, that police dogs found her body. 
	The Old Bailey trial was told that Gyarmati and Miss Kovacs had met when they briefly lived together in the same property. 
	Detective Chief Inspector Nicola Wall said: ""Alexandra was a young woman starting out in life when she was killed by Laszlo Gyarmati. 
	""She was working very hard sending money back to Hungary to her mum and younger brother."" 
	DCI Wall added: ""Alexandra knew Gyarmati and was happy to be in his company that evening. She obviously had no thoughts that he would hurt her. Sadly he betrayed that trust in the ultimate way.""

	Thanks to Nicolas Anelka, the ""quenelle"" now has a much wider international audience. 
	The FA, meanwhile, finds itself trying to navigate a minefield of French racial politics and trying to send a signal as to what is permissible now the Premier League has become a global platform for any player with a cause. 
	The spur for the rule changes was the racism cases brought against John Terry and Luis Suarez, who received bans of four and eight matches respectively for abusing an opponent. 
	With the Terry case taking more than a year to conclude, the aim of the new rules was to speed up the process and standardise the punishment, starting with a minimum five-match ban. 
	By comparison with the Anelka case, they look straightforward. 
	Many people in France and beyond, including the interior minister and the federal courts, say the quenelle is anti-Semitic. 
	Look at pictures posted by fans of its inventor - French comedian Dieudonne, who is also Anelka's friend - and there seems little doubt. 
	It has been performed at Auschwitz, at Holocaust memorials across Europe and even the Tolouse synagogue where three children were shot dead by a gunman. 
	So at the very least there is a case to answer. The outcome, however, may come down to interpretation. 
	Anelka has denied racist intention from the outset. He says he was simply showing solidarity with Dieudonne, who has multiple convictions for inciting racial hatred and finds himself banned by the French state. 
	Dieudonne's lawyers claim he is simply attacking ""taboos"", though few would describe the Holocaust in such terms. 
	There is no question that he has support in France. 
	French-born to Cameroonian parents, his background and provocative stand has made him a lightning rod for a seam of disaffected French youth, many of them drawn from north African and other Muslim immigrant communities, who admire his willingness to take on the establishment. 
	With the French economy ailing and unemployment rising, it is a rich seam - and Dieudonne's populist instincts, together with his support for the Palestinian cause, have brought him support. 
	When we visited one of his banned shows in Nantes earlier this month, the regard for Dieudonne among thousands of fans was undeniable. 
	Asked if he was anti-Semitic, several people told us he was in fact anti-Zionist, not racist. 
	It is a distinction an FA panel may soon be asked to draw.

	The conclusion of Alistair Webster QC said to the alleged victims: there is ""credible"" evidence of harassment; you deserve an apology. But it assured Lord Rennard that nothing could be proven beyond reasonable doubt. 
	The peer doesn't want to say sorry in case it opens the door to a civil case against him. Mr Webster insists that would not happen. 
	A Lib Dem source admits this is a ""personal tragedy"" for the peer who joined the party as a teenager and rose to become its chief executive. But he feels more sorry for the victims, and says it is right to apologise. 
	""There is one man who could bring this to an end 11 months ago, six months ago, today.” 
	Head-in-hands is perhaps the best way to describe the mood in Clegg HQ. They know this is now spiralling into a major problem for their leader who is being accused of a disastrous mishandling of a scandal. This could put off the female voters they are desperate to attract. 
	But a big part of the problem is the report that – by concluding Lord Rennard was guilty but not guilty – has managed to satisfy nobody.

	The Prime Minister said he made ""absolutely no apology"" for his stance. 
	A tougher test is also to be introduced, with migrants being quizzed for the first time about whether their English language skills will be a barrier to them finding employment and about what efforts they had made to find work before coming to Britain. 
	Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has suggested making EU migrants wait for up to two years to claim benefits in the UK, rather than the current period of three months. 
	Addressing the World Economic Forum in Davos, Mr Cameron said: ""The right to move in Europe and apply for jobs in other European countries and take those jobs is an important freedom in the European Union which I subscribe to. 
	""It is a right to move, to go and work - it should not be a right to move to go and claim benefits. 
	""That is why I make absolutely no apology for tightening the British benefits system so that it can't be abused, and I think that is absolutely the right thing to do."" 
	He said when the last Labour government gave ""immediate access to the British labour market"" to the eight countries - Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia - that joined the EU in May 2004, ""without any transitional changes"", 1.5 million people moved from those countries to Britain. 
	""That was probably the largest migratory movement that has happened in recent British history,"" he said. 
	""I think if you ask the founders of the European Union, 'was it your intention that there would be movements like that?', I think they would have said that was not the intention at all. 
	""So what I am saying, is that when it comes to future accessions, when new countries join the European Union, we should look at transitional controls that we have, we should look at longer transitional periods, and frankly we should look at longer transitional periods thinking about their purpose. 
	""And the truth is this: if you have countries of a relatively similar GDP, you tend to get migratory movements of a relative balance ... when you have vast disparities of GDP, you can get vast movements. 
	""I think in looking at these future transitional controls we should be asking the question, not only do they need to be longer, but do we need to look at issues like making sure GDP per capita becomes more equal before those controls are taken away. 
	""Now I would argue that is practical, good, conservative common sense, and frankly, that is something the European Union needs a lot of,"" he added, to some applause from the audience. 
	Britain is already in a legal battle with the European Commission which says that it is unlawful to test immigrants before they can claim benefits. 
	It comes amid concerns about an influx of Romanians and Bulgarians who are now entitled to come to the UK for work and will be able to claim benefits like other EU citizens.

	He said: ""I  thought he was up to no good so I chased after him and into an alley. I said 'you probably won't want to hear this but I'm your local MP'. He replied with some unparliamentary language. Then the police and store detective arrived very quickly."" 
	Mr Carswell added that he thought the man was in his twenties or thirties and saw a number of bottles of aftershave falling from his pockets and clothes as he gave chase.

	It was ""reassuring that the police were there so quick,"" he said.

	Scientists at Scotland's Rural College say good grass-growing conditions last year, and the production of excellent quality of silage and hay had led to cattle becoming obese. 
	This can cause problems when calving and pose a risk to both the mother and her young. 
	Livestock farmers are being advised to identify any cattle which may have overeaten, and slim them down urgently. 
	Beef specialist Dr Basil Lowman noticed the problem among herds he visited over the winter. 
	He said: ""Some producers are concerned about the condition of their cows and the potential for a much higher risk of calving difficulties when calving starts in a month’s time."" 
	Difficulties at calving time are often linked to the condition of the cow, and can cause significant costs. 
	It can lead to the new-born calf to struggle and be more at risk from disease, while the cows face the threat of increased infertility. 
	Dr Lowman said: ""If there are a proportion of obese cows, with rings of fat clearly visible around their tail-head then these should be drawn out into a separate group and put onto a well-balanced, straw-based ration to encourage them to lose as much fat as possible prior to calving. 
	""This may seem just extra costs and hassle but compared with severe calving difficulties, caesareans or even casualties, it will be time and money extremely well invested."" 
	But as part of a cow's diet, experts stress the need to maintain the animal's protein and mineral intake. 
	Feeding the cow only straw would cause complications and kill it.

	After saturated southern England is hit by further flooding this weekend, low pressure will start to bring change across the UK next week. 
	The change comes as a ""major incident"" was declared on the Somerset Levels which have seen weeks of severe flooding and remain underwater. 
	Sedgemoor District Council chief executive Kerry Rickards said: ""With significant rainfall expected over the coming days we feel this situation needs to be escalated as a major incident."" 
	The council said it would continue to provide practical support to residents whose properties are flooded or are predicted to flood. 
	Next week's drop in temperature will come as a shock following a wet but exceptionally mild December and January, Sky News Weather Presenter Isobel Lang, said. 
	""The low bringing us rain this weekend will slip away southwards allowing significantly colder air to seep west and southwestwards across us on a biting east or northeast wind. 
	""It will be a shock to the system after a mild December, the mildest since 1988, and a mild first half of January with a mean UK temperature up to January 15 of 5.1C, which is 1.5C above average. 
	""Snow is likely, especially over hills, with more widespread frosts too."" 
	But Lang said the change looked unlikely to last. 
	""At this stage the Atlantic influence still looks strong and it could be that the cold air pushes back into continental Europe again by the end of the week,"" he said 
	The Met Office has warned of a wet and windy Sunday. 
	It will then turn colder and ""increasingly wintry, particularly across northeastern parts"", its UK five-day forecast reads. 
	Its summary for the 10 days from Tuesday warns of biting easterly winds and temperatures near or just below normal. 
	The change to weather more like the January we expect comes after weeks of rainfall that have left large areas of the UK waterlogged. 
	The Environment Agency has 10 flood warnings in place in southwest and southeast England and 91 lower level flood alerts in place, mainly in the southeast and southwest but also in other parts of England and Wales. 
	The UK has largely escaped a big freeze this winter, unlike the United States which saw a polar vortex bringing some of the lowest temperatures ever seen across many states followed by heavy snow this week.

	The flamboyant transvestite potter said the award was recognition for ""30 years of hard graft"". 
	The Turner Prize-winning artist regularly appears dressed as his female alter-ego Claire and did not disappoint his fans at Buckingham Palace for the investiture ceremony. 
	Mr Perry once described Claire as ""a cross between Katie Boyle and Camilla Parker-Bowles"". 
	But when reminded of this after the ceremony he laughed and said: ""This is my Italian mother of the bride outfit. 
	""When I got the call (about the CBE) my first thought was what am I going to wear, it's a serious thing I'm not going to compromise my identity as Britain's pre-eminent transvestite. 
	""I googled to see what people wore and went for the sexier end. I always do like the older woman who makes an effort."" 
	A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said that Mr Perry's ""attire was entirely appropriate"". 
	Mr Perry is a married family man who spends hours meticulously making ceramic pots and is also a self-styled transvestite. 
	The vases are beautifully crafted and at a distance look like ornaments most people would love to own. 
	But they are covered in words - including crudely-incised graffiti - and sometimes graphic images depicting his own past or railing against society. 
	Born in 1960 in Chelmsford, he began his career at Braintree College of Further Education and then at Portsmouth Polytechnic, where he studied fine art. 
	Later when he moved to London in the early 1980s he began attending evening pottery classes and developed a strong connection with the medium. 
	He has said that he loves using clay because ""it is held in such low esteem in the art world"". 
	Mr Perry won the Turner Prize in 2003 after being nominated for the piece Claire's Coming Out Dress and a collection of vases depicting the dark recesses of life. 
	The pots are covered with subject matter such as child abuse, autobiographical images of himself, Claire and his family, as well as examinations of cultural stereotypes. 
	Speaking at the palace, Mr Perry said: ""I'm grateful I'm not one of these people who has sky-rocketed to fame. 
	""Some people say I've become a member of the establishment but I've been that for years. I'm an RA (Royal Academician). 
	""The idea that rebellion is at the margins of society - that's false, it's far more interesting to be mischievous from the centre.""

2014-01-25,Take-Home Pay 'Rising Faster Than Prices',https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140125095110/http://news.sky.com/story/1200248/take-home-pay-rising-faster-than-prices,"By Darren McCaffrey, Sky Political Reporter Prime Minister David Cameron has claimed the benefits of the recovering economy are now being felt, with the vast majority of people seeing a significant rise in their take-home pay. 
	In a counter attack on Labour's so-called cost of living crisis, the Government said workers' take-home pay was now rising faster than inflation. 
	According to figures released by the Treasury, nine out of 10 British workers have seen their take-home pay increase in the past year. 
	Nearly everyone except the richest 10% saw their take-home pay rise by at least 2.5% once tax cuts were taken into account. 
	This is above the Consumer Price Index inflation rate which stood at 2.4% in the year ending April 2013. 
	However, the statistics are being fiercely disputed by Labour, who have accused the Conservatives of being ""highly selective"" with their statistics and failing to ""understand the cost-of-living-crisis"". 
	Ministers claim conditions have improved most for the bottom 50% of earners with take-home pay rising three quarters faster than CPI inflation. 
	Though the figures take into account cuts to income tax and national insurance, they do not include cuts to benefits to people in work. 
	Minister of State for Skills and Enterprise Matthew Hancock MP said: ‪""Of course as a consequence of the Great Recession people who work hard have been made poorer and times are tough for families as a result. 
	‪""That's why, as part of our long-term economic plan, we are cutting taxes for hardworking people so they have more money in their pockets and are more financially secure. 
	""Last year, our tax cuts meant people's take home pay rose faster than prices. So while there is still a long way to go, these figures show our plan is working. 
	""Only by continuing to work through our long-term plan will we secure a better future for Britain."" 
	Labour though argued that for most - real wages have fallen. 
	Shadow Treasury Minister Cathy Jamieson said: ""The truth is that under David Cameron real wages have fallen by over £1,600 a year and analysis of IFS figures show families are on average £891 worse off as a result of tax and benefit changes since 2010. 
	""At the same time this government has given a huge tax cut to people earning over £150,000."" 
	Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said the Government's figures did not take account of benefit reductions and so did not reflect what has happened to household incomes overall. 
	Mr Johnson said it appeared that pay was now rising faster than inflation for most workers, but predicted that - after inflation is taken into account - incomes will remain ""well below"" their pre-recession levels by the time of the 2015 general election. 
	""There are two problems with this which one needs to take into account,"" he said. 
	""First, we have other sets of data - the Office for National Statistics publishes an average weekly earnings index. That went up quite a lot less quickly than inflation in the most recent months. 
	""And of course they are not taking account of reductions in things like benefits which were occurring over the time. 
	""So if you are looking at household incomes, that will be different from what's happened to take-home pay,"" he told BBC Radio. 
	Mr Cameron used a speech at the annual economic summit in Davos this morning to push for more job creation - especially in manufacturing. 
	He also said fracking and developing ""cheap and predictable"" energy sources could boost the economy and could help attract back to the UK jobs which had been ""off-shored"" to the rising economic powers of Asia.

	Emma Wilson, 25, from Windsor in Berkshire attacked her own toddler inflicting a catalogue of 'catastrophic' injuries. 
	Callum Wilson was born on April 23 2010 and spent his first months with foster parents. 
	In November 2010, Callum returned to the care of his mother at her flat in Paddock Close. 
	In March 2011 neighbours described hearing five or six loud bangs coming from the flat, the following morning Ms Wilson called paramedics to help her son who she said was ""lifeless and not doing anything"". 
	During the trial at the Old Bailey prosecutor Paul Dunkels QC told the jury: ""The effect of the injuries would have been immediate and catastrophic."" 
	In court Ms Wilson tried to blame the injuries on the toddler's two year old brother who she said was ""boisterous"". 
	The jury though returned a unanimous verdict of guilty to murder. 
	The jury were also shown a series of 'selfie' photograph taken in the days before the fatal attack where Ms Wilson was smiling at the camera with her son behind her - at this stage he could be seen with minor injuries. 
	Judge Stephen Kramer QC told Wilson: ""You are adept at lying and once you have decided to lie you are adept at sustaining that lie."" 
	As she was taken down to the cells Wilson was in tears, as were members of her family who were watching on from the public gallery. 
	Speaking after the verdict, Det Ch Insp Ian Hunter from Thames Valley Police said: “This case has been a harrowing and emotional journey for all involved. 
	""Callum's life was cruelly cut short and he suffered an abhorrent catalogue of abuse at the hands of his mother. 
	""This conviction demonstrates the absolute commitment of the prosecution team and witnesses to ensure justice was served. Our thoughts will always be with Callum."" 
	A neighbour and friend of Ms Wilson, who didn't want to be identified, told Sky News: ""I thought she was a good mum. 
	""I don't know why if people saw him going downhill at nursery or whatever they didn't step in earlier.""

	According to research by MoneySupermarket.com the nation's capital has 12 of the postcodes on the list. 
	But Manchester had the most burglary claims overall in the past 12 months - with 45.2 per thousand people. 
	Herne Hill and Tulse Hill in SE24 in London were close behind with 41.8, and Muswell Hill in N10 chalked up 40.9. 
	Birmingham and Liverpool each have two postcode districts in the top 20. 
	Leeds saw the biggest decrease in robbery claim hotspots. 
	Kevin Pratt, home insurance expert at MoneySuperMarket.com, said: ""Just because somewhere is named a claim hotspot it doesn't actually mean the area in question is not a nice place to live. 
	""Thieves often target areas with wealthy residents and desirable properties where the rewards are potentially greater, or quieter areas where they think there is less risk of being caught red-handed."" 
	The findings were based on more than three million home insurance quotes, and reveal that households in high risk areas pay about 24% more for insurance each year. 
	Jim Maddan, chairman for the Neighbourhood & Home Watch Network, added: ""The majority of burglaries are opportunistic and criminals will often simply choose the easiest-looking target. 
	""Something as simple as being on speaking terms with your neighbours and passing the time of day could mean that they notice when something is wrong - or it might be you who notices something is amiss and saves your neighbour from misfortune. 
	""Crime does not flourish in communities where people care about each other."" 
	Postcodes in Hampshire's Basingstoke are among those least likely to have made a claim, as are postcodes in Devon, the East Riding of Yorkshire and Londonderry in Northern Ireland. 
	MoneySuperMarket recommends the following tips to keep your home safe: 
:: Always keep doors and windows locked when you're asleep, or your home is unoccupied.
:: Install timers on your lights to come on when you are not home.
:: Ensure items of value are kept away from easy view through windows.
:: Install a suitable alarm system.
:: Ensure your home contents insurance is fully up to date.

	Dan Evans pleaded guilty last year to hacking at both the Sunday Mirror and the News Of The World (NOTW) and providing a false witness statement. 
	This is the first time those guilty pleas could be reported. 
	Evans, 38, told the jury he was approached by staff from the NOTW three times before he finally resigned from the Sunday Mirror in October 2004. 
	He said: ""I was bringing phone hacking techniques and methodology. I was bringing a pretty lengthy list of phone hacking targets. People whose voicemails had been intercepted, general skills to perpetuate that activity."" 
	Evans discussed the practice with staff from the NOTW when they had their first meeting to discuss a possible job, the court heard. 
	He said: ""Voicemail interception became part of the conversation. It was not referred to as phone hacking - that phrase did not exist then."" 
	Evans told the jury he was involved in hacking at the Sunday Mirror for about a year and a half from 2003, but it had been going on before that. 
	He told the court about the 'kerching moment' when he met Andy Coulson at a hotel to discuss a job at the NOTW for the third time. 
	""I got onto voicemails and interception and I told him I had a lot of commercially sensitive data in my head and how things worked at the Sunday Mirror and I could bring him big exclusive stories cheaply which was the kerching moment,"" he said. 
	""Bring exclusive stories cheaply equals job."" 
	Evans was offered the job the same day and started at the NOTW in January 2005 on a salary of £53,000. 
	On his first day, he was taken into a meeting room and handed a contacts list by a NOTW journalist who cannot be named, he said. 
	Among the names were Heather McCartney, Esther Rantzen, Chris Evans, Ed Balls, Ronnie Biggs, Elle Macpherson, the father of soap star Jessie Wallace, Michael Parkinson, John Leslie, Geri Halliwell and Michael Jackson. 
	Evans said he was rather ""crestfallen"" at being given the task. Asked what that task was, he said: ""(The journalist) wanted me to hack the interesting names on there."" 
	He told the court he would hack phones ""probably most days"" while at the NOTW, and he had accessed voicemails more than 1,000 times. 
	He claimed the newspaper used a company that could provide personal information including phone numbers, medical and tax records within three hours. 
	Earlier, the Old Bailey got off to a dramatic start when actor Jude Law learned for the first time that a member of his immediate family sold a story about him to the NOTW.

	The mother of 20-year-old Megan Roberts reported her daughter's disappearance after a friend raised the alarm when she failed to hear from her. 
	Megan, who is originally from Wetherby and is studying at York St John University, was last seen in Popworld nightclub, on George Hudson Street, at around 2am on Thursday, January 23. 
	A spokesman for North Yorkshire police said: ""Nobody has heard from Megan since, which is very out of character and officers are very concerned for her safety."" 
	Megan is described as around 5ft 6in tall, of medium build with long dark brown hair. 
	When she was last seen she was wearing a cream knee-length dress which had large brown and orange flowers on it and black plimsoll-type shoes. 
	Police are appealing for anyone who has seen Megan since the early hours of Thursday or knows where she is to contact them urgently. 
	They are also appealing to Megan herself to contact her friends, family or the police to let them know she is safe.

	The DJ - who is on trial accused of indecently assaulting 10 women and sexually assaulting another - told a jury at Southwark Crown Court that claims he was a sex pest were ""nonsensical"". 
	He said: ""I do not have a predatory nature with women, I have a cuddly nature. Maybe that's what this is all about, but I am not predatory. 
	""If I really like somebody I will put my arm around them and I might give them a peck on the cheek, I even do that with men, to make them feel comfortable and welcome to the place."" 
	He also denied that he and Jimmy Savile were close, and said he would have reported him to the police had he known he was a paedophile. 
	When questioned by Stephen Vullo, for the defence, he said: ""I, like other people, did think 'he seems to like young girls'. 
	""He was always surrounded by girls and by that I mean girls of 16, 17, 18. 
	""But I don't think that anyone knew what was going on as far as him being a paedophile. 
	""In all honesty, if I had known that Jimmy Savile was a paedophile I would have been the first to get him arrested because it is the worst crime in the world as far as I am concerned."" 
	Jurors heard he complained to police last September that he and his wife had ""suffered badly"" as a result of the allegations, and he had lost work. 
	Junior prosecutor Teresa Hay said: ""Mr Travis said that for 10 months he had lost his money, work, his health, he has had back and knee operations and had suffered stress. 
	""Worse still his wife had suffered breast cancer. She was through it now but stress is bad for someone who is going through that. 
	""This was costing him his job, his living and everything he has built up over 50 years. 
	""For him these allegations don't stand up."" 
	Travis, 68, from Buckinghamshire, denies 13 indecent assaults and one sexual assault, dating back to 1976.

2014-01-27,RBS Earmarks Nearly £3bn For New Payouts,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140127221607/http://news.sky.com/story/1201896/rbs-earmarks-nearly-3bn-for-new-payouts,"The Royal Bank of Scotland is setting aside £3bn for new litigation and customer compensation claims, which is expected to push the taxpayer-backed lender into an annual loss of around £8bn. 
	While members of the bank's executive board members will not be receiving bonuses, RBS chief executive Ross McEwan said some bankers would get a payment. 
	He told Sky News that failing to do so would risk RBS losing ""exceptional talent"". 
	In an unscheduled trading statement that deals a blow to the bank's turnaround hopes, it said it would allocate £1.9bn to cover claims relating to mortgage-backed financial products. 
	An extra £465m had been earmarked for Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) compensation payouts. 
	This was because claims had continued at previous rates - £225m per quarter - rather than falling as expected, and were forecast to continue for longer, according to the bank which is 80% taxpayer-owned. 
	It takes the total amount set aside for the PPI compensation scheme to £3.1bn, of which £2.2bn had been used at the end of 2013. 
	A further £500m had also been allocated for claims relating to the mis-selling of complex financial products, known as interest rate swaps, to small firms. 
	A £200m provision has been made to cover legal expenses. 
	The news sent a shudder through the City, with RBS's share price falling late in the day and closing down 2.2%. 
	Mr McEwan said in a statement that ""bad decisions"" made in recent years meant that ""some problems are still just emerging"". 
	He later told Sky News: ""It was a large number to put out in the marketplace today. 
	""I would say at least now we are in such a good financial position we can take having to put aside close to £3bn to really again look after litigation and conduct issues from the bank's past history. 
	""We were the biggest bank in the world and we had businesses on all continents, so I don't think it's surprising that some of these things will emerge as regulators and people take litigation against banks. 
	""What's really important here is we are in a position to handle these losses now, these provisions. 
	""We have certainly got a path that we are building for our strategic review to show a really good bank emerging from the last five years of all the changes that have been made. 
	""When exceptionally large banks go wrong, which is what happened here, it takes a very long time to get them right again. 
	""I truly believe that we can turn this bank around and make it a great success for the UK."" 
	Defending the payment of bonuses to some staff, Mr McEwan, who had previously said that he would not take a bonus for 2013 or 2014, said: ""I need to be in a position to be paying people fairly for the job that they do. 
	""I know that is hard for people to understand but that is the business we are in. 
	""Right now we are a back-marker on pay. We need to make pragmatic decisions about staying in the marketplace to keep hold of that talent while we change this bank dramatically."" 
	RBS said the additional cash provisions would be reflected in its full-year results to be published on February 27. 
	The additional £1.9bn for mortgage-backed securities followed ""recent third party litigation settlements and regulatory decisions"", said the lender. 
	It was towards the end of last year that in the US that JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay $13bn (£8bn) to settle complaints over mortgages and mortgage securities. 
	Around the same time, an RBS subsidiary agreed to pay $153.7m (£95.5m) to settle a US investigation into allegations it misled investors over a sub-prime mortgage product. 
	Responding to the RBS announcement, Business Secretary Vince Cable: ""They are absolutely shocking numbers and taxpayers will be appalled they are still facing the bill for abuses that took place, five, ten years ago, the chronic mis-selling, the swaps that were sold to small business, and insurance mis-selling. 
	""This is dreadful stuff and the price is still being paid and it's still damaging our economy. 
	""The one good thing is that the directors have accepted they mustn't accept bonuses and the bank under new management is now getting on with serious banking."" 
	The chairman of the Treasury Committee, Andrew Tyrie MP, said customers and taxpayers were paying a ""heavy price"" for the past misconduct of the bank. 
	He said: ""It is crucial for the recovery that lending, particularly to (small and medium-sized businesses), is not constrained as a result.""

2014-01-27,Paterson: Flood Victims 'Right' To Be Angry,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140127221607/http://news.sky.com/story/1201480/paterson-flood-victims-right-to-be-angry,"Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has admitted the Government could have done more to help residents in areas affected by flooding - and that dredging of some rivers should have happened. 
	Heavy rain is forecast for areas already hit by floods, with some communities in Somerset - where the council has declared a ""major incident"" - facing a fourth week under water. 
	Motorists and commuters have been warned of ice, sleet and snow with temperatures expected to plummet to around freezing in some parts of the UK. 
	Mr Paterson has today visited Northmoor Green in Somerset, where he held crisis talks with council chiefs and farmers whose crops have been damaged by the stormy weather. 
	Facing tough questions from furious locals on the official response to the flooding, Mr Paterson told Sky News: ""How shocking it is for people to be flooded and I really do appreciate the impact floods have had on people ... they are quite right to be angry."" 
	He acknowledged the national guidelines on dredging were not appropriate for the Somerset Levels, large parts of which are below sea level. 
	In defence of the Environment Agency, Mr Paterson said it had protected a million homes and was ""working incredibly hard"". 
	He said he had asked local officials to present him with ""a very clear action plan"" within six weeks to enable him ""to make a categoric decision once and for all"" on a ""long-term serious plan"" for the area for the next 20 years. 
	Several counties including Hampshire and Dorset also remain at risk of flooding, while further snowfall is expected across Wales, Scotland and northern England. 
	The Environment Agency has issued more than 140 flood alerts and 10 further serious flood warnings across England and Wales. 
	John Osman, leader of Somerset County Council, said he was ""hugely disappointed"" there would be no immediate extra funding to protect flood-hit communities. 
	""We will continue to keep the pressure on to secure a fair deal for Somerset's residents,"" he said. 
	Bryony Sadler, of Flooding on the Somerset Levels Action Group (FLAG), dismissed Mr Paterson's visit as a ""publicity stunt"". 
	""It was a waste of taxpayers' money,"" the hairdresser said. ""We are here, we have lived like this - like a third world country - for three weeks. We have just pushed and pushed and pushed. 
	""It is all just a great show for the cameras, isn't it? No-one is listening to what we want to say. It is very depressing, it is very negative."" 
	Matthew Lay, national officer of Unison, said: ""Communities up and down the country will remain in danger until the Environment Agency is given adequate resources and funding to prevent and handle disasters caused by floods."" 
A number of serious flood warnings are in place for parts of the South West, South East, Midlands and North East with the Environment Agency advising people in affected areas to take immediate action. 
	The Somerset Levels, which run south from the Mendip Hills to the Blackdown Hills, are particularly vulnerable with 31,000 acres under water, as further heavy rain falls on already saturated ground. 
	There is also potential for further river flooding across the South West and southern counties including parts of Wiltshire, Dorset, Hampshire, West Sussex, West Berkshire and Surrey into next week. 
	The Environment Agency is running more than 60 pumps around the clock to drain an estimated 65 million cubic metres of floodwater from the Levels. 
	A temporary pontoon has been erected near the village of Langport to allow residents to get to their homes and a boat service is ferrying people to and from work and school. 
	As well as the flood alerts, parts of Scotland have been told to brace for strong winds gusting up to 80mph. 
	Nazaneen Ghafar, Sky News Weather Presenter, said: ""Wintry showers are likely and the risk of some overnight snow across northern areas from Wednesday onwards. 
	""There will also be the continued chance of hail at times, and ice will be an increasing problem."" 
	On Sunday, light snow flurries affected parts of northern England, including in Cumbria, where snow ploughs were used to clear sections of the A66. 
A ""mini tornado"" was reported in parts of the Midlands and southern Britain, where trees were brought down, power supplies knocked out and outbuildings damaged.

2014-01-27,'Red Knight' Shorts Manchester United Shares,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140127221607/http://news.sky.com/story/1202023/red-knight-shorts-manchester-united-shares,"By Mark Kleinman, City Editor A hedge fund headed by one of the financiers who failed to buy Manchester United four years ago is betting against the club's New York-listed shares. 
	Sky News can exclusively reveal that Marshall Wace, one of the world's biggest hedge funds, stands to reap a profit worth millions of pounds if Manchester United continues to perform as poorly on the stock market as it is doing at its Old Trafford home. 
	The emergence of Marshall Wace's position in United's shares comes as the Premier League champions struggle to avoid their most ignominious season for more than two decades. 
	Already out of the League Cup and FA Cup competitions, they trail the Premier League leaders Arsenal by 14 points and face a tough task to progress further in the Champions' League. 
	Paul Marshall, one of the founders of Marshall Wace, was a member of the Red Knights consortium which in 2010 launched a campaign to persuade Manchester United's owners to sell the club. 
	The American Glazer family refused to engage with the Red Knights, who were led by Jim O'Neill, the former chief economist at Goldman Sachs. In August 2012, the Glazers floated the club on the New York Stock Exchange. 
	Since then, United have continued to enjoy reasonable success on the pitch, winning the Premier League title last season in Sir Alex Ferguson's final campaign at the helm. 
	His successor, David Moyes, has endured a torrid start to his Old Trafford career, however, with a series of home defeats culminating in last week's League Cup exit to Sunderland. 
	The size of Marshall Wace's short position in Manchester United's shares is unclear, with a spokesman for the hedge fund declining to comment on Monday. 
	Under US rules, hedge funds do not have to disclose the extent of their short positions in publicly-traded stocks. 
	However, insiders said that Marshall Wace had placed a ""not immaterial"" bet on a further decline in the club's shares, which have fallen nearly 14% during the last 12 months. 
	Mr Marshall is understood to have sanctioned the investment decision, adding a further layer of intrigue to the club's ownership. 
	Marshall Wace is far from the only investor expecting to make money from an ongoing fall in its share price. 
	Odey Asset Management, the hedge fund led by Crispin Odey, a prominent City financier, was disclosed in December as holding a short position worth approximately $5m. 
	Last week, it emerged that Manchester United had been relegated from the leading trio of the world's wealthiest football clubs after being usurped by Barcelona, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich. 
	The annual list compiled by the accountancy firm Deloitte revealed that the English club had slipped into fourth place with annual revenues of £347.7m. 
	That figure will slide further next year if Manchester United fail to finish in the top four of this season's Premier League. 
	On Monday, the club's shares were trading down roughly 1.6% at $14.78, valuing it at just under $2.5bn. 
	Mr Marshall is one of the City's most successful money-makers, amassing a vast fortune from the firm he set up with his business partner, Ian Wace. 
	A Manchester United fan, he has argued more broadly for supporter-based ownership of football clubs, criticising the Glazers in an article for The Times last year. 
	""In 2005, United became perhaps the most famous UK victim of the excesses that led to the global financial crisis, when they were taken over by a family of US-based real estate developers with no connection to the city. 
	""The Glazers could not afford the asking price but a banker from JPMorgan named Ed Woodward came up with the wheeze of 'payment in kind' notes, effectively a form of very high interest-bearing loans that enabled the Glazers to acquire the club by putting £500m of debt on to its balance sheet, turning it overnight from the wealthiest club in the country to the most debt-laden.""

	He has been in politics for two decades: he knows what to expect. A letter to the Daily Telegraph by 24 business leaders was always a likely outcome. 
	Labour will tell you that one in three of the figures are Tory donors, with one - Karren Brady - even introducing the Chancellor at the party's annual conference. 
	Still, they know it's news. 
	And though they may be a little taken aback by the strength of the attacks from former Labour figures, they won't be that surprised that they oppose the policy. 
	Mr Balls has made a simple political calculation: that ordinary voters will not share the views of wealthy business leaders. And he may be right. 
	Ben Page, chief executive of market research firm Ipsos MORI, tells me the 50p tax rate is a popular measure, especially with Labour's core vote. 
	He says the British public is pretty ""anti-business"" in its attitudes. 
	Labour characterised the coalition’s decision to reduce the top rate to 45p as a ""tax cut for millionaires"". It said it destroyed the claim that we are all in this together. 
	In reversing it, it wants to contrast its own position to be on the side of those who don’t earn more than £150,000 - the vast majority of the British electorate. 
	But that doesn't mean this is a risk-free decision for Mr Balls. Big business has a loud voice. When such high-profile individuals wade into a debate it makes headlines on television, radio and on the front pages of newspapers. 
	And that may influence opinion - particularly Mr Page warns, among the ""swing voters"" who will be key to the next election. 
	Labour was in charge when the financial crisis triggered a deep recession. It has taken a hit on economic credibility. One of its biggest challenges ahead of the next election is to convince people to trust it again. 
	Mr Page argues that it is all about ""competence"". 
	People voted for Tony Blair despite him saying he would put up taxes because they thought he was competent. They rejected Neil Kinnock because they did not. 
	Labour has a mountain to climb in regaining public trust on its handling of the economy. Hearing a former Labour minister say the shadow chancellor would not get a GCSE in economics on the back of these plans can't help.

2014-01-27,Anelka Leads FA Into Minefield Of Racial Politics,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140127221607/http://news.sky.com/story/1198585/anelka-leads-fa-into-minefield-of-racial-politics,"When the Football Association wrote new rules to tackle discrimination, it's a safe bet they did not envisage them being tested by a black French Muslim player accused of anti-Semitism for using a gesture only recognised by a minority in France. 
	Thanks to Nicolas Anelka, the ""quenelle"" now has a much wider international audience. 
	The FA, meanwhile, finds itself trying to navigate a minefield of French racial politics and trying to send a signal as to what is permissible now the Premier League has become a global platform for any player with a cause. 
	The spur for the rule changes was the racism cases brought against John Terry and Luis Suarez, who received bans of four and eight matches respectively for abusing an opponent. 
	With the Terry case taking more than a year to conclude, the aim of the new rules was to speed up the process and standardise the punishment, starting with a minimum five-match ban. 
	By comparison with the Anelka case, they look straightforward. 
	Many people in France and beyond, including the interior minister and the federal courts, say the quenelle is anti-Semitic. 
	Look at pictures posted by fans of its inventor - French comedian Dieudonne, who is also Anelka's friend - and there seems little doubt. 
	It has been performed at Auschwitz, at Holocaust memorials across Europe and even the Tolouse synagogue where three children were shot dead by a gunman. 
	So at the very least there is a case to answer. The outcome, however, may come down to interpretation. 
	Anelka has denied racist intention from the outset. He says he was simply showing solidarity with Dieudonne, who has multiple convictions for inciting racial hatred and finds himself banned by the French state. 
	Dieudonne's lawyers claim he is simply attacking ""taboos"", though few would describe the Holocaust in such terms. 
	There is no question that he has support in France. 
	French-born to Cameroonian parents, his background and provocative stand has made him a lightning rod for a seam of disaffected French youth, many of them drawn from north African and other Muslim immigrant communities, who admire his willingness to take on the establishment. 
	With the French economy ailing and unemployment rising, it is a rich seam - and Dieudonne's populist instincts, together with his support for the Palestinian cause, have brought him support. 
	When we visited one of his banned shows in Nantes earlier this month, the regard for Dieudonne among thousands of fans was undeniable. 
	Asked if he was anti-Semitic, several people told us he was in fact anti-Zionist, not racist. 
	It is a distinction an FA panel may soon be asked to draw.

	The lawyer wrote down a name of a source on a piece of paper to show the witness. The name was not read in court. 
	Asked if he knew the family member was getting paid, he said: ""I have never been aware of that, getting paid for it."" 
	The first he knew of that was today, in the court, he said. 
	He told the court he first became aware of rumours of the affair around the time the couple went to Miller's sister Savanah's wedding in the West Country and Law was shown NOTW articles headlined ""Sienna Cheats On Jude"" and ""Layer Fake"". 
	He told the court he had telephoned Craig to confront him about the affair and suggested he should tell his own girlfriend about it. 
	But he could not remember whether that was before or after the paper broke the story and he had not left a voicemail about it. 
	Asked if he was aware that anyone around him was leaking stories, he said: ""No, I did not know that anyone around me was talking to the newspapers, although I suspected it because there was such a flow of information ... I suspected many people over that period of time."" 
	Law told the court that the media had ""an unhealthy amount of information"" about his life. 
	The actor said press attention intensified after his Oscar nomination for The Talented Mr Ripley in 2001 and photographers would follow him around, even when he made social plans in secret. 
	He told the court the intrusion grew throughout his divorce from Sadie Frost and then during his relationship with his Alfie co-star Miller. 
	Sitting in the witness box, Law said: ""There seemed to be an unhealthy amount of information that people, or someone, had that meant they had access to my life and my whereabouts."" 
	He said when police showed him notes that private investigator Glenn Mulcaire held about him, he ""was shocked to see the amount of information that had been accumulated"", but he added: ""Sadly it didn't surprise me because it seemed apparent from what had been written (in the press)."" 
	Law told the jury that from around 2001 photographers would gather at his home. 
	""Around 2001 and over the following four or five years the daily appearance of packs of photographers either on the street or in cars became a very regular occurrence."" 
	He added: ""I became aware that I was also turning up at places having arranged to go there secretly ... and the media were already there, or photographers were already there."" 
	Also giving evidence at the trial on Monday was tabloid reporter Daniel Evans who admitted phone hacking at the Sunday Mirror and the NOTW. 
	He told the court he was involved in hacking at the Sunday Mirror for about a year and a half from 2003 but it had been going on long before that. 
	He told the court he had been approached by a journalist to join the NOTW in 2005 but initially he did not want a job there to be the journalist's ""pet phone hacker"" when he wanted to do more investigations work. 
	Evans said he had met Coulson and told him he ""did stuff with phones"" and that Coulson understood what the context of it was. 
	Coulson and Rebekah Brooks deny conspiring to hack phones and commit misconduct in a public office. 
	The trial continues.

2014-01-27,Google Buys UK Intelligence Firm DeepMind,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140127221607/http://news.sky.com/story/1201630/google-buys-uk-intelligence-firm-deepmind,"Google has bought a London-based tech company that specialises in artificial intelligence (AI), Sky News has confirmed. 
	It purchased DeepMind Technologies Ltd in a deal worth a reported £240m. 
	One of the DeepMind's current directors previously predicted AI machines will learn ""basic vision, basic sound processing, basic movement control, and basic language abilities"" by 2020. 
	Google has been improving the company's AI expertise and recently bought military robot maker Boston Dynamics, among other robotics companies. 
	It is believed to be working on a project to develop next-generation robots and is already trialling driverless vehicles. 
	DeepMind has become a major independent force in development of AI and currently develops algorithms for games, simulations and online commerce sites. 
	The Deepmind deal was first revealed by tech site re/code and it said Google CEO Larry Page led negotiations. 
	DeepMind is heavily involved in the enigmatic AI field of machine learning, where systems are improved as data is processed over time. 
	Last week Google CEO Eric Schmidt warned delegates at the World Economic Forum that technological innovation may wipe out whole swathes of jobs. 
	He said that many roles are being automated by IT systems and it would become one of the biggest global issues in the next two to three decades. 
	DeepMind's website is just a single page stating it combines ""the best techniques from machine learning and systems neuroscience to build powerful general-purpose learning algorithms"". 
	It was founded by 37-year-old Demis Hassabis in late 2010. DeepMind says it is ""supported by some of the most iconic technology entrepreneurs and investors of the past decade"". 
	The founder was a child chess prodigy and video game designer by the age of 16, who later went on study computer science at Cambridge and gained a PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience at University College London. 
	As the start-up expanded Dr Hassabis' firm took on additional directors to boost both technical and financial clout. 
	Those were IT entrepreneur Luke Nosek, Mustafa Suleyman, investment banker David Gammon, Skype co-developer Jaan Tallinn and machine super intelligence expert Shane Legg, in that order. 
	Mr Legg predicted there will be humanlike artificial general intelligence (AGI) before 2030, with ""impressive proto-AGI"" functionality by 2020. 
	Mr Gammon left as director in early 2012 to become chairman of Cambridge-based software games firm Frontier, while remaining an adviser to DeepMind. 
	Last June, venture capitalist Bart Swanson became the firm's sixth director. 
	Mr Swanson was formerly chairman of Summly before it was sold to Yahoo! and held a senior role at a firm before it was sold to eBay. 
	He also helped lead the international expansion of Amazon at the turn of the century. 
	Facebook unveiled a partnership with New York University last year for a new centre for artificial intelligence, aimed at harnessing the social network's vast resource of data. 
	The deal comes as Google and Samsung agreed a global patent cross-license partnership covering technologies and business areas. 
	The agreement covers the two companies’ existing patents as well as those filed over the next 10 years, and was developed to stop needless litigation.

2014-01-27,Nigella Lawson: No Police Action Over Drugs,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140127221607/http://news.sky.com/story/1201716/nigella-lawson-no-police-action-over-drugs,"Police will take no further action against Nigella Lawson after she admitted taking drugs, Scotland Yard has said. 
	The TV cook made the confession during the trial of her two former assistants - Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo - on fraud charges. 
	They were alleged to have used company credit cards to buy items for themselves, including designer shoes and clothes, but were found not guilty of fraud. 
	The 53-year-old revealed she took the Class A drug cocaine with her late husband John Diamond when he discovered he had terminal cancer, and in July 2010 when she claimed she was the subject of ""intimate terrorism"" by former husband Charles Saatchi. 
	She also admitted she started using cannabis during the final year of her marriage to Mr Saatchi, which ended last year. 
	In a statement, Scotland Yard said there were ""serious public interest concerns"" about the impact a prosecution would have on potential future witnesses and victims. 
	""Whilst witnesses clearly cannot simply admit to any offence under oath without consequences, this has to be balanced with the requirement for victims and witnesses to tell the truth. 
	""Further police activity may deter victims from being candid with police and in court for fear of future investigation."" 
	The trial in December heard allegations that the Grillo sisters used company credit cards to spend £685,000 on items for themselves, including designer shoes and clothes. 
	In an email, Mr Saatchi claimed Ms Lawson's drug use meant she allowed their former assistants to spend what they wanted. 
	""Of course now the Grillos will get off on the basis that you ... were so off your head on drugs that you allowed the sisters to spend whatever they liked and, yes, I believe every word they have said,"" the message said. 
	Ms Lawson branded the idea that she was a habitual user of the drug as ""absolutely ridiculous"". 
	She said was ""not proud"", but would rather be ""honest and ashamed"" about what she had done. 
	Speaking to US network ABC at the start of January, Ms Lawson described the ordeal as ""mortifying"" and said her ""only desire"" was to protect her children.

2014-01-27,South Bank Awards For Broadchurch And Monkeys,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140127221607/http://news.sky.com/story/1201837/south-bank-awards-for-broadchurch-and-monkeys,"By Richard Suchet, Arts and Entertainment Correspondent Crime drama Broadchurch and rock group Arctic Monkeys were the big winners at this year's South Bank Sky Arts Awards. 
	The ceremony at The Dorchester hotel on Park Lane - hosted by Melvyn Bragg - celebrates the finest talent in a range of artistic disciplines from literature to opera, pop music to film. 
	BBC Two had two nominations in the TV drama category for Top Of The Lake and The Fall but was pipped by ITV's critically acclaimed Broadchurch, starring David Tennant and Olivia Colman. 
	Colman told Sky News she and the cast were thrilled to have won: ""I'm excited. Ready to get on the booze!"" 
	""Being in a room with these people who I consider so magical compared to us, no offence to actors, but, Darcey Bussell was here and there was clip of what she can do with her legs,"" she added. 
	""It's humbling, musicians and artists, it's exciting that we're all there and that we've had an impact on people's lives and they enjoyed what we did."" 
	David Bowie's first studio album in a decade, The Next Day, lost out in the pop music category to the Arctic Monkeys' AM, which also beat Disclosure's debut album Settle. 
	All three artists were nominated for the Mercury Prize in October but were beaten by James Blake. 
	There was disappointment for Steve Coogan who had high hopes of success with a nomination in the comedy category for Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa, and a nomination for Philomena in the film category. 
	But he went home empty-handed after being beaten to the comedy prize by rising star Bridget Christie who won for her show A Bic For Her.  
	Clio Barnard's The Selfish Giant was preferred to both Philomena and Hanif Kureishi's film Le Week-End starring Jim Broadbent and Lindsay Duncan. 
	Barnard's gritty story of the life of a teenage scrap scavenger has also been nominated for an outstanding British film Bafta. 
	Bragg told Sky News the coming together of the arts is what makes the South Bank Awards so special: ""It's not film people against film people, it's people from all across the arts. 
	""What it's really saying is, all these things are equally intriguing, equally high quality, they're just doing different things and that's a recognition that I think people like."" 
	Artist Tracy Emin was presented with the outstanding achievement award by comedian Frank Skinner. 
	This year the South Bank Awards' trophy was designed by pop art supremo Sir Peter Blake who co-created the album cover for The Beatles' Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. 
	The South Bank Sky Arts Awards will be broadcast on Sky Arts 1 on Thursday January 30 at 9.30pm.

2014-01-27,Cameron Pledges To Slash 'Crazy' Red Tape,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140127221607/http://news.sky.com/story/1201576/cameron-pledges-to-slash-crazy-red-tape,"Thousands of pages of ""crazy"" guidance for businesses will be cut by up to 90%, the Prime Minister has told business leaders. 
	Speaking at a Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) conference, David Cameron has said the coalition is planning to scrap or change more than 3,000 regulations from the ""serious to the ridiculous"". 
	Mr Cameron said that 80,000 documents of environmental guidance will be significantly slashed, including 286 pages of regulations on hedgerow maintenance and 380 pages on waste management. 
	Around 100 house-building standards will also be reduced to fewer than 10. 
	Mr Cameron says his government will be the first in modern history to have reduced the overall burden of red tape, saving more than £850m a year. 
	""We will scrap over-zealous rules which dictate how to use a ladder at work or what no-smoking signs must look like,"" he said. 
	""We've changed the law so that businesses are no longer automatically liable for an accident that isn't their fault. 
	""And the new Deregulation Bill will exempt one million self-employed people from health and safety law altogether. 
	""Let me just give you a few more crazy examples dreamt up in the past by Whitehall bureaucrats. 
	""Employees used to be able to sue their employer if they were insulted by a customer. We've changed the Equality Act to stop that. 
	""Shopkeepers used to need a poison licence to sell oven cleaner - we're scrapping that."" 
	Mr Cameron says that supporting business is crucial to the coalition's long-term economic plan. 
	""That is why, among so many other things, I have insisted on slashing needless regulation,"" he said. 
	""This will make it easier for you to grow, to create jobs and to help give this country the long-term security we are working towards."" 
	Mike Cherry, FSB national policy chairman, has said it is an historic moment for the FSB. 
	""We are delighted David Cameron will be joining us in celebrating the hardworking men and women whose businesses are the lifeblood of our economy and local communities,"" he said. 
	""Having support from the Prime Minister and policymakers from all parties is critical to ensuring small business issues are front and centre of the economic debate around rebuilding and rebalancing our economy."" 
	But TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said the Government is attacking worker and consumer rights. 
	""Stripping self-employed workers of health and safety protection - when construction is riddled with bogus self-employment scams - will make injuries more likely,"" he said. 
	""And removing any obligation on employers to protect their staff from sexual and racial harassment by customers sends a very clear signal whose side the Government is on. 
	""The real problems facing small businesses are an economy that has been slow to recover due to austerity economics and the continuing failure of banks to lend."" 
	At the FSB conference, Labour announced plans to follow the US lead of creating a Small Business Administration (SBA) to work across government to encourage growth. 
	Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna will tell the FSB: ""We need government to be a better servant - and customer - of our small businesses and to make sure that entrepreneurs' voices are heard at the top table. 
	""A UK Small Business Administration is necessary to realising this ambition.""

2014-01-27,Pensions Top-Up Plan Would Increase Pay Out,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140127221607/http://news.sky.com/story/1201765/pensions-top-up-plan-would-increase-pay-out,"People in or nearing retirement are to be given the chance to use their savings to top up their state pension. 
	The new scheme will allow eligible pensioners to pay in lump sums from as little £900. 
	In return they will see an increase in their state pension by as much as £25 a week. 
	The offer will apply to all existing pensioners and those retiring before April 2016. 
	Pensions Minister Steve Webb MP said: ""One of the problems for people who have already retired is that their savings are often getting very poor rates of interest. 
	""What the Government is saying is if people have a bit of capital put by and they want to give it to us in the form of extra Voluntary National Insurance Contributions, we will increase their pension and that will go on for as long as they live, and it will be linked to inflation. 
	""And if they die and there's a surviving spouse a bit of money will go to them as well. 
	""It's just a new way of using your savings to boost your retirement income."" 
	The exact amount people will have to put in is to be released later in the year, Mr Webb said. 
	He has said because women generally live longer, they will get better returns from their contributions. 
	""Because we charge the same to men and women, and women live longer on average, it will be attractive to many women because they pay the average price for men and women, but they will live longer than the average price,"" he said. 
	Pensions expert Michelle McGagh agrees that it could be a huge boost to women. 
	""Traditionally women have stayed at home, they've had career breaks to raise children so they may not have paid all their national insurance stamps, which means they don't get the full basic state pension,"" she said. 
	""By being able to top up this pension, they will also not only get the basic state pension, they may also be able to get a little more depending on how much they decide to put in."" 
	Ms McGagh said thousands of people may be able to take up the offer, but there is a short time frame. 
	""There's only 18 months to take advantage of the Government's very generous offer,"" she said. 
	From April 2016, a flat rate state pension system will be brought in. 
	It will see all new pensioners paid one rate above the means testing level, equal to around £144 in today's money.

2014-01-27,'Mini Tornado' Sweeps Through Parts Of Britain,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140127221607/http://news.sky.com/story/1201373/mini-tornado-sweeps-through-parts-of-britain,"A ""mini tornado"" has swept through parts of the Midlands and southern Britain, bringing down trees, knocking out power causing damage to outbuildings. 
	The funnel-shaped formation was spotted above several towns in Surrey including Chobham, Epsom and Knaphill, as well as in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, and in Harlow, Essex. 
	Ferocious thunderstorms accompanied by heavy rain and hail were reported in Birmingham, Nottingham and Milton Keynes, as well as parts of Kent and Essex. 
	Twitter and Facebook were flooded by messages and pictures from people caught up in the severe weather. 
	Pam Steadman said parts of an equestrian centre next to her house in Epsom were lifted over trees at the bottom of her garden. 
	Heather Riley reported ""lots of damage to houses and cars"" in Nuneaton, Warwickshire. 
	Darran Jaques, who described the weather as ""wild"", said scaffolding had been ripped down and shop fronts damaged in northeast Surrey, while Jean Ramgoolam tweeted: ""Looks like a mini tornado just went past!"" 
	It is thought the intense weather may have been caused by a squall line - a band of thunderstorms that precedes a cold front. 
	Satellite pictures showed a clear line of heavy storms moving slowly across the country from the North West to the South East. 
	As well as damage to property, the severe weather caused widespread power cuts across the country. 
	UK Power Networks, which maintains electricity cables and lines across London, the South East and the East, said it received a ""high number of calls"" from customers as the storm swept through. 
	In the area around Tonbridge, Kent, more than 8,000 people were left without power, although supplies have since been restored for most. 
	The storms come as communities in the South and South West prepare for possible flooding, with further heavy rain forecast to fall on already saturated ground. 
	Sedgemoor District Council has declared a ""major incident"" on the Somerset Levels, where pumps are being used to keep floodwater away from homes. 
	Other parts of the country, including the Northern Pennines and parts of western Scotland, saw a sprinkling of snow.
