2014-07-05,Queen Names UK's Newest And Biggest Warship,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140705015538/http://news.sky.com/story/1294717/queen-names-uks-newest-and-biggest-warship,"By Alistair Bunkall, Defence Correspondent The Queen has named the UK's new aircraft carrier, marking a major milestone in the history of the Royal Navy. 
	At 65,000 tons, HMS Queen Elizabeth is the biggest and most powerful warship ever built in the UK. 
	The naming ceremony, in Scotland, was attended by the Duke of Edinburgh, the Prime Minister, the Opposition leader, the leader of the SNP and heads of military. 
	About 3,500 people involved in the design and building of the carrier also watched the celebrations. 
	Before naming the ship the Queen said: ""Lord Mountbatten told my father on becoming king that 'there's no more fitting preparation to be king than to be trained in the Royal Navy'. 
	""My own personal associations ... remind me that that reputation for excellence continues to this day. 
	""In sponsoring this new aircraft carrier I believe that Queen Elizabeth, as flagship for the Royal Navy, will be a source of inspiration and pride for us all."" 
	The Queen then smashed a bottle of Islay malt whisky, rather than the traditional champagne, on the ship's hull, reflecting the role Scotland has played in its construction. 
	Earlier, Aircraft Carrier Alliance managing director Ian Booth, who oversaw the construction of the ship, said: ""This is a historic occasion for our country and a proud moment for more than 10,000 people across the UK who have worked together to deliver HMS Queen Elizabeth. 
	Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: ""HMS Queen Elizabeth is the largest ship that the Royal Navy has ever had and is a true demonstration of the UK at its best. 
	Eventually, F-35B Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter planes will fly off the carrier, although the Government is yet to announce the order of the first tranche of planes. 
	Confirmation of that order is expected within weeks. 
	The F-35 is the world's first fifth-generation fighter jet. The 'B' variant ordered by the UK Government can land vertically and take off on a short runway like its predecessor, the Harrier jump jet. 
	But it means that, for its first two years of service, HMS Queen Elizabeth will sail with only helicopters onboard. 
	A decision on the future of a second carrier, HMS Prince of Wales, has been delayed until 2016, although the Government is expected to keep it as part of the fleet rather than sell it off. 
	Together, the two carriers will cost £6.2bn to build. 
	Later this month, the new carrier will be floated for the first time before she embarks on sea trials for a few years and finally enters service."
2014-07-05,PM Orders Probe Into Paedophile Dossier,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140705015538/http://news.sky.com/story/1295317/pm-orders-probe-into-paedophile-dossier,"By Anushka Asthana, Sky News Political Correspondent The Prime Minister has ordered an investigation into what happened to a dossier containing explosive allegations about paedophile activity by powerful and famous figures in the 1980s. 
	David Cameron said he wants Mark Sedwill, the permanent secretary to the Home Office, to do ""everything he can"" to get to the truth. 
	The Government has been under pressure to act after claims that a list of names of suspected child abusers, including high-profile men in the establishment, was passed by the MP Geoffrey Dickens to the then-home secretary. 
	Lord Brittan admitted he received the dossier and passed it on to officials - but no action was ever taken. 
	""I quite understand people's concerns about these events that were referred to over 30 years ago,"" Mr Cameron said. 
	""And that is why I've asked the permanent secretary at the Home Office to do everything he can to find answers to all of these questions and make sure we can reassure people about these events."" 
	Mr Cameron warned that nothing must be done to ""prejudice or prevent proper action by the police"" but urged anyone with information of ""criminal wrongdoing"" to come forward. 
	The move comes after an investigation by the Home Office in 2013 into what happened - which was not fully published - concluded that the ""credible"" parts of the dossier were passed on to prosecutors while other parts were ""not retained or destroyed"".  
	Mr Dickens' son, Barry, said he was dismayed by the lack of action over the files which his father had warned would ""blow everything apart"". He told Sky News that he wanted to see the Prime Minister take action. 
	Many of the questions focused on the Elm Guest House in Barnes, southwest London, where there have been allegations that senior members of the establishment abused children. 
	One figure who was said to go there was the former Lib Dem MP, Cyril Smith, about whom allegations of serial child abuse have emerged since his death in 2010. 
	One 16-year-old claimed he was abused by Smith at the Barnes institution. The allegations were contained in a book co-authored by Labour MP Simon Danscuk. 
	Barry Dickens told Sky News that an investigation by Mr Sedwill was inadequate. 
	""I’m not convinced the Home Office can investigate its own failings,"" he said. 
	Many are now calling for a full public inquiry into the allegations, although the Prime Minister and others have warned that it was right for the police to take the lead. 
	Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who has investigated claims of abuse by Smith, said: ""The Prime Minister knows that there is a growing sense of public anger about allegations of historic abuse involving senior politicians and his statement today represents little more than a damage limitation exercise. It doesn't go far enough. 
	""The public has lost confidence in these kind of official reviews, which usually result in a whitewash. The only way to get to the bottom of this is a thorough public inquiry."""
2014-07-05,Paediatrician Accused Of Sex Attacks On Boys,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140705015538/http://news.sky.com/story/1294967/paediatrician-accused-of-sex-attacks-on-boys,"By Emma Birchley, East of England Correspondent A paediatric doctor has appeared in court accused of sex offences against cancer patients as young as 11. 
	Dr Myles Bradbury, 41, who worked as a paediatric haematologist at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, is accused of four counts of sexual assault and a further four of engaging in sexual activity with boys. 
	The boys were aged between 11 and 15. 
	Cambridge Magistrates' Court also heard that Bradbury, of Herringswell, Suffolk, was found with 16,629 indecent still images of children and 20 indecent videos. 
	Delia Matthews, prosecuting, said: ""He was in a position of trust as he was a doctor of these children who were cancer patients. They were very vulnerable."" 
	She added he could face up to seven years in prison. 
	The offences are said to have taken place between December 2011 and December 2013. 
	Bradbury is also facing charges of making indecent images of a child and one act of voyeurism, where it is alleged he secretly filmed somebody engaged in a sex act. 
	Magistrate Stephanie Bishop said: ""On what we have heard it would be inappropriate for these charges ... to be dealt with in the magistrates court."" 
	Wearing a dark blue suit, white shirt and tie, Bradbury spoke only to confirm his name, date of birth and address. 
	He did not indicate any likely plea and was bailed to appear before Cambridge Crown Court on July 11. 
	Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Trust, which runs Addenbrooke's Hospital, has set up a helpline to be used ""if parents, patients or former patients have any concerns"". 
	The Trust added it was working closely with the NSPCC. 
	The helpline, on 0800 389 8625, can be reached between 8am and 9pm on weekdays and 9am to 5pm at weekends."
2014-07-05,Boxer Amir Khan Arrested Over Assaults,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140705015538/http://news.sky.com/story/1295346/boxer-amir-khan-arrested-over-assaults,"Former boxing world champion Amir Khan has been arrested on suspicion of two assaults in Bolton. 
	Khan, 27, was held after two teenagers were attacked in the early hours of Friday. 
	A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said: ""Just before 1.30am on Friday, police were called following reports of an assault in Bolton. 
	""Officers attended Russell Street and discovered two 19-year-old men had been assaulted. Their injuries are not serious. 
	""A 27-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of two section 47 assaults."" 
	The former WBA and IBF light welterweight champion has been released on bail until mid July. 
	An ambulance spokesman said paramedics attended the scene but those at the scene refused treatment. 
	A spokesman for the light welterweight fighter confirmed he had been questioned by police but was expecting the case to be dropped. 
	He added that some reports in the media had seen the allegations ""blown out of all proportion"". 
	""It was a minor incident and we're expecting the case to be dropped against Amir,"" the spokesman said. 
	""We're expecting to formally hear that from police on Monday morning."" 
	Khan later tweeted about the arrest, writing: ""All nonsense please don't believe what you read. I'm home with my family and nobody got beat up."""
2014-07-05,Rolf Harris Spending His First Day In Prison,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140705015538/http://news.sky.com/story/1295047/rolf-harris-spending-his-first-night-in-prison,"Rolf Harris is spending his first full day in prison after being jailed for five years and nine months for sexually abusing girls and young women. 
	One of his four victims was just seven or eight years old when she was attacked by the disgraced entertainer. 
	The judge at Southwark Crown Court Mr Justice Sweeney said Harris had abused the trust placed in him because of his celebrity status - and had shown no remorse. 
	The 84-year-old's sentence has been referred to the attorney general after a member of the public said it was unduly lenient. 
	He will now decide whether to pass the sentence on to the Court of Appeal for review. 
	Harris, convicted on Monday of 12 counts of indecent assault between 1968 and 1986, was flanked by guards in the dock as the punishment was handed down. 
	His other three victims, including the best friend of Harris' daughter Bindi, were teenagers aged between 14 and 19. 
	Mr Justice Sweeney told the shamed performer: ""You have shown no remorse for your crimes at all. 
	""Your reputation lies in ruins, you have been stripped of your honours, but you have no one to blame but yourself. 
	""You took advantage of the trust placed in you because of your celebrity status to commit the offences."" 
	During the seven-week trial, prosecutor Sasha Wass described Harris as a ''sinister pervert''. 
	She claimed he had a ''dark side'' and was a ''Jekyll and Hyde character''. 
	The main complainant was Bindi's best friend, to whom seven of the 12 counts related. 
	The woman, now aged 49, said she had been ""traumatised"" by the years of abuse she suffered. 
	She said: ""The attacks that happened have made me feel dirty, grubby and disgusting. The whole sordid saga has traumatised me."" 
	Another victim, Australian Tonya Lee - who waived her right to anonymity - said her assault by Harris in a London pub during a visit to England was a ""turning point"" in her life that she has never recovered from. 
	She said: ""I have never felt safe since, I live in a constant state of anxiety."" 
	A third victim, indecently assaulted by him as she went to get his autograph at a Portsmouth community centre when she was seven or eight, said Harris' assault took away her childhood. 
	She said the attack left her angry and confused, adding: ""I became an angry child, unable to express myself and unable to trust men."" 
	A fourth victim, who was assaulted when she was a teenager as Harris took part in a celebrity game show in Cambridge in the 1970s, said he took advantage of her, making her feel ashamed. 
	She said: ""He treated me like a toy that he had played with for his own pleasure."" 
	Harris had arrived at court accompanied by Bindi, and made his way inside the building without commenting to reporters. 
	In the dock, he had a small, multi-coloured suitcase on a chair behind him. 
	His wife, Alwen, was not in court as she was apparently unwell. 
	Harris' lawyer Sonia Woodley told the court that despite his convictions he had led an "" upright life"" for the last 20 years, and had done ""much good"". 
	Harris had earlier left his riverside home in Bray, Berkshire by boat as he made his way to London to hear his fate. 
	Since his conviction Harris has been stripped of his Bafta fellowship, lost an honorary degree from the University of East London and also faces losing his CBE."
2014-07-05,Allegations Of Harris' Shocking Web Searches,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140705015538/http://news.sky.com/story/1295019/allegations-of-harris-shocking-web-searches,"Details of Rolf Harris' alleged web searches for sexual images of young girls have been revealed - but prosecutors say the convicted paedophile will not go on trial over the claims. 
	The 84-year-old had 33 sexual photographs of children in a much larger collection of thousands of adult pornographic images, it was claimed. 
	But Harris' legal team told judge Mr Justice Sweeney the models in the photos were over 18, according to their identity documents provided by website bosses in the Ukraine. 
	They also maintained the entertainer accidentally accessed the images when he clicked on links from mainstream porn sites. 
	Harris was found guilty on Monday of 12 counts of indecent assault between 1968 and 1986 and was jailed on Friday for five years and nine months. 
	One of his four victims was seven or eight year old, and the rest were teenagers aged between 14 and 19. 
	Prosecutor Sasha Wass QC said: ""In the light of the 12 unanimous convictions on the counts that Mr Harris faced, the Crown Prosecution Service has decided it is no longer in the public interest to proceed with a trial on these four charges."" 
	Prosecutors claimed he had looked at a website called ""teeny tiny girlfriends"" and accessed a picture of a girl who was ""extremely young in appearance"". 
	Harris also allegedly clicked on other words including ""youngest teen porn"", ""my little nieces"" and ""young teen girls"". 
	Expert opinion gathered by both sides disagreed over whether the images were of underage girls, with the prosecution claiming one was of a child under 13. 
	This was denied by the defence, which maintained that all the models were adults and that the word ""teen"" could refer to someone of 18 or 19 years of age. 
	As the counts were debated during legal argument, Ms Wass said: "" If it was an accident, it appears to be an accident he had a number of times."" 
	Both sides agreed he had clicked on ""young teen galleries"" and ""Russian virgins"" while looking at porn. 
	Prosecutors alleged he deleted the images because he knew they were illegal, but again the defence denied this."
2014-07-05,Firefighters To Strike For Eight Days Running,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140705015538/http://news.sky.com/story/1295152/firefighters-to-strike-for-eight-days-running,"Firefighters in England and Wales are to strike over eight consecutive days as a result of their long-running pensions row. 
	The industrial action, which starts on July 14, will take place for between two and four hours a day throughout the strike period. 
	The Fire Brigades Union said it had decided to escalate action as current proposals on pensions and later retirement age were ""unacceptable, unworkable and unrealistic"". 
	The FBU has been negotiating with the Government for three years over plans to change the fire service's pension scheme. 
	The union says firefighters will end up paying more, working longer and receiving less. 
	The Government says the deal gives firefighters one of the most generous pension schemes in the public sector. 
	Justifying the strike, FBU General Secretary Matt Wrack said: ""The Government must realise that firefighters cannot accept proposals that would have such devastating consequences for their futures, their families' futures  - and the future of the fire and rescue service itself. 
	""We have tried every route available to us to make the Government see sense over their attacks. 
	""Three years of negotiations have come to nothing because the Government is simply unwilling to compromise or even listen to reason despite a huge amount of evidence showing their planned scheme is unworkable. 
	""Shorter strike periods have illustrated the strength of feeling among firefighters whilst limiting disruption to the fire service, the public and our members' working lives. 
	""But the Government is merely ploughing ahead, forcing firefighters to react."" 
	FBU members in Wales and England are also intending to join a huge strike by more than a million public sector workers next Thursday."
2014-07-05,What If Tory Donor Gets Top Ofsted Role?,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140705015538/http://news.sky.com/story/1295206/what-if-tory-donor-gets-top-ofsted-role,"Choosing a new chair of Ofsted was always likely to attract controversy. 
	There was public outcry when the education secretary Michael Gove first created the vacancy by refusing to reappoint Baroness Sally Morgan. 
	Critics said his decision to effectively ""sack"" a woman who was a close aide to Tony Blair was nakedly political. 
	Lib Dem education minister David Laws was said to be ""furious"" - accusing his boss of trying to shoehorn in ""one of his own"" to the top role. 
	He made clear that he wanted to stop the imposition of Theodore Agnew - a Tory donor who runs academies. 
	The controversy that followed led to Mr Agnew to withdraw himself from the race. 
	Sky News has revealed that one man on the list - and considered a frontrunner - is... wait for it...a Tory donor who runs academies. 
	David Ross, the co-founder of Carphone Warehouse, has given the party more than £200,000. 
	Yet so far the Lib Dems are not kicking up as much of a fuss. Why? 
	Firstly they say there is a difference between the two men - that Mr Agnew was more involved in Conservative education policy. 
	But, secondly, because they insist that Mr Gove will not be able to wield much influence because they have put in place a system that keeps the decision at an arm's length. 
	Mr Ross, they add, is a legitimate candidate in that process. 
	""We are not saying being identified as party political disqualifies you,"" says one source. 
	""But what we have ensured is an independent process looking at names that would command cross party political support - including Labour."" That final point, they say, is ""particularly important"". 
	That is why they were so angry about Baroness Morgan, because they believe she was exactly that - a ""big tent, centre-ground figure who had proved herself capable of working across party boundaries"". 
	In many ways it is a surprise that Mr Gove's relationship with her cooled in the first place. 
	He is, after all, a Tory politician who has never hidden his admiration for New Labour, even once describing himself as ""heir to Blair"". 
	She was even a supporter of his free school movement - but also not afraid to criticise schools that were part of it. 
	And now that she is not going to be serving a second term, she is not afraid to criticise Mr Gove either. 
	She spoke out to claim she is now on a ""fairly long list of people who are non-Conservative supporters who are not being reappointed"". 
	But it isn't just about party politics. There is also frustration about the diversity of the people being appointed to these public positions. 
	Tom Gash, director of research for the Institute for Government, has pointed out that the number of women is stubbornly steady at around one third of appointments while the number of people from ethnic minorities has fallen dramatically. 
	He also warns that Mr Ross will have to show that his role in charge of academies is not a conflict of interest from a position in a watchdog meant to scrutinise such academies. 
	It may be that Mr Ross's political ties are not the only point of controversy."
2014-07-05,Tour De France: Opening Ceremony In Yorkshire,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140705015538/http://news.sky.com/story/1294674/tour-de-france-opening-ceremony-in-yorkshire,"By Gerard Tubb, Sky News Correspondent The opening ceremony of the 101st Tour de France has been held at Leeds Arena as thousands of church bells rang out across Yorkshire to celebrate. 
	The event's traditional team presentation saw 198 riders from 22 of the world's top cycling teams parade through the town where they will get a royal send off on Saturday by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. 
	The parade through Leeds was followed by a stage show headlined by Yorkshire band Embrace and included the orchestra and chorus of Opera North, and Girls Aloud star Kimberley Walsh. 
	Two minutes of bell ringing in towns and villages across the county was organised as part of the event theme ""The People of Yorkshire Welcome The World"". 
	If that sounds a bit over the top, at times during the weekend it is likely to feel as though the world has descended on some of Yorkshire's narrowest and most picturesque streets. 
	An estimated two million people will line the routes, with villages in the Yorkshire Dales National Park being warned that up to 700 vehicles an hour will be trying to get in before the race starts. 
	Although locals will be inconvenienced by the traffic, 300 miles of road closures and 30,000 traffic cones they are being told to expect a £100m economic boost thanks to increased tourism and inward investment attracted by the publicity. 
	In Otley, where riders will power through the town centre on Sunday's race from York to Sheffield, the benefits are already being felt. 
	The Black Horse Hotel, which closed down last year, has been the scene of frantic activity as the owners worked to refurbish and re-open it in time for the weekend's crowds. 
	Meanwhile the Coach and Horses pub in Harrogate, the home town of British sprinter Mark Cavendish's mum, has changed its name to the Cvndsh and Horses. 
	Cavendish has been tipped as a possible winner of the first day's race, which could mean being presented with the coveted yellow jersey by the Duchess of Cambridge. 
	Tour de France Race director Christian Prudhomme told Sky News he was hugely impressed with what he has seen. 
	""The Tour de France is not only the world's greatest bike race, we need a stunning backdrop,"" he said. 
	""Yorkshire is gorgeous, that is very important. You have the passion."""

	The 32-year-old was gunned down in the Sparkbrook area of the city at around 7.30pm on Wednesday. 
	Two other men were taken to hospital - one with a gunshot wound and another with a slash across his body. 
	Armed police were called to the area by horrified residents, one of whom described how people rushed from their homes to help after hearing gunfire. 
	Syed Shah told the Birmingham Mail: ""There were two shots, 30 seconds apart, and then I heard someone crying. 
	""People came out of their houses. There was a young man in the road and someone was holding him, crying. 
	""I've never seen such a heinous crime. It's just inhumane."" 
	Other residents told the newspaper a large group of people surrounded the victims within minutes of the attack. 
	""I've never seen anything like this around here,"" one witness said. ""It's shocking to say the least."" 
	A spokesman for West Midlands Police said Grantham Road and Farm Road remained cordoned off while detectives continued their investigations. 
	""Five men have been arrested in connection with the disorder ... and are currently helping detectives with their enquiries,"" he said. 
	Anyone with information is asked contact West Midlands Police on the non-emergency number 101. Alternatively, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111."
2014-07-05,Jayden Accused 'Grabbed Teen By The Neck',https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140705015538/http://news.sky.com/story/1294525/jayden-accused-grabbed-teen-by-the-neck,"The former binman accused of murdering teenager Jayden Parkinson has described the moment his ex-girlfriend stopped breathing after he grabbed her around the neck. 
	Ben Blakeley, 22, told his trial at Oxford Crown Court that after the 17-year-old told him she was pregnant, he did not believe her. 
	Giving evidence for the first time, he told jurors he got two pregnancy tests from a discount store and arranged to meet up with Ms Parkinson the following day. 
	He said they went to some fields to the south of Didcot where they planned to have sex near a footbridge. 
	The pair had a dispute near the footbridge after Blakeley questioned Ms Parkinson about whether she had cheated on him with another man. 
	He told the court: ""I said: 'What the f***' or something like that. That's when I grabbed her."" 
	""I said you are definitely lying about that dude. She just let go, didn't answer and looked down. 
	""I grabbed her around the neck. 
	""Two hands. I didn't grab her that hard. I had grabbed her harder before."" 
	Asked how long he held her, he replied: ""Not long ... seconds."" 
	""I let go of her. She fell backwards off the bridge on to the ground into the mud. 
	""She was making noises when she was on the floor."" 
	During the evidence, Ms Parkinson's mother Erica Simms left the court crying. 
	Blakeley also broke down in tears. When he composed himself, he said: ""I don't want people to see me crying."" 
	He said he later held a mobile phone over Ms Parkinson's face to see if she was breathing, but she was not. 
	""I just sat there, I was upset, I was praying, I was f****** upset,"" he said. 
	Blakeley also told the court about his troubled childhood, during which he says he was regularly beaten by his father. 
	The court heard that he was taken into care at the age of 11, and that he would often run away from children's homes. 
	The jury has been told that Blakeley had an obsessive and controlling personality, and that after splitting up with Ms Parkinson he threatened to post intimate photos and videos on Facebook. 
	Blakeley conceded that he had made the threat, but said he would never have followed through with the act. 
	Describing their relationship, he said: ""We had a laugh, smoked weed, drink and sniff, flirting. 
	""We would go to churches and pray. She would pray for stupid stuff like I wouldn't go bald. 
	""We just connected. We were perfect at times, we were f****** perfect. We were in love."" 
	Ms Parkinson was last seen alive with Blakeley on December 3 last year in Didcot, Oxfordshire.  
	Blakeley, of Christchurch Road, Reading, in Berkshire, denies murdering the teen but admits her manslaughter and attempting to pervert the course of justice over the disposal of her body. 
	The prosecution has refused to accept his manslaughter plea and he has gone on trial alongside a 17-year-old boy, who cannot be identified for legal reasons. 
	The youth has also pleaded guilty to attempting to pervert the course of justice but denies a charge of preventing a lawful burial because he says he did not know he was helping bury Jayden's body. 
	Ms Parkinson's body was recovered from the grave of Blakeley's uncle, Alan Kennedy, at All Saints' churchyard in Didcot on December 19. 
	A post-mortem examination determined that Ms Parkinson died as a result of pressure to the neck. 
	It also found evidence of ""relatively widespread"" areas of bruising to her face and scalp which was indicative of being caused by a fist or foot. 
	The trial continues."

	The thundery storms came after Britain enjoyed its hottest day of the year on Friday. 
	A Heathrow spokeswoman said: ""During thunderstorms the number of aircraft that can take off and land each hour is reduced."" 
	Sky News weathers forecasters said heavy thundery showers will continue to spread north and west this evening, with eastern Scotland and north-eastern England having a dull damp start to Sunday morning. 
	Flights from Dublin, Madrid and Prague were among those cancelled, according to the airport's website.

	The Environment Agency has warned up to 30mm (1.2in) of rain could fall in an hour. 
	Almost every county in England and Wales is at ""medium"" risk of flooding, according to the EA, which has issued 59 flood alerts, warning people to be prepared. 
	The majority of the warnings are in the Midlands, the South East and the South West. 
	It will be unsettled again on Sunday with sunny spells and showers, and more heavy downpours and thunderstorms.

	He added: ""We are not aware of the nature of the injuries. It is very fortunate that it was only four people injured, all things considered."" 
	Wightlink ferries said a full investigation into the incident is now under way. 
	""The incident has been reported to the Marine Accident Investigation Branch and Wightlink is fully co-operating with the authorities,"" it said. 
	""St Helen, in common with all Wightlink ferries, is inspected regularly by external surveyors. The last independent engineering survey of the ship, including its mezzanine decks, took place in May 2014 during her annual refit."" 
	Portsmouth police warned of delays for people hoping to travel to the Isle of Wight from the city. 
	A spokesman said on Twitter: ""Just liaised with Wightlinkferry (our side), there are delays for those wanting to travel tonight to the IOW due to the earlier incident."""

	John Allen, who worked at international law firm NautaDutilh, has been described as a ""much-loved colleague"". He died on the flight alongside his Dutch wife, Sandra Martens, and their three sons - Christopher, Julian and Ian. 
	""He was a person with many talents, and in addition to his professional contribution to our firm he generously shared his musical and athletic abilities with us as well,"" the firm said. 
	""All of us who had the privilege of working with John during his 18 years at NautaDutilh came to know him as a kind, down-to-earth and humorous man and many of us have also lost a friend. He will be dearly missed."" 
	His sister Wonder Allen Smith posted a picture of her brother on Facebook with the following statement: ""I lost my whole family, my only brilliant brother and his beautiful wife and three magnificent children in the mh17 airplane crash"". 
	The final British person onboard the flight has been named as Andrew Hoare. 
	Meanwhile, the Percy Hedley Foundation, which cares for disabled people, said it has been unable to contact the family of one of the children in its care. It said it was working with authorities to try and establish what has happened to them. 
	The foundation has not revealed the nationality of the child or the family. 
	Another British victim Robert Ayley has been confirmed as being on board the Malaysia Airlines flight. A friend of Mr Ayley has told how the father-of-two almost missed the flight. 
	Bill Patteson, who was travelling with the 27-year-old around Europe visiting Rottweiler breeders, has told Sky News his friend didn't make it onto the bus to take him from his hotel to Amsterdam's Schiphol airport. 
	But Mr Ayley, who was originally from Guildford but moved to New Zealand as a child, managed to get there in time to board the ill-fated Malaysia Airlines flight, which was shot down over Ukraine with almost 300 people on board. 
	An ex-journalist, helicopter pilot, students and Newcastle United fans are among the other British victims. 
	Mr Patteson, who flew back to New Zealand the day before, said: ""There were so many things that came together to make Rob be on that flight. 
	""The stars really had to align for Robert to be on that flight, even right down to the last minute. 
	""Everyone was hoping he'd missed the flight, but Robert being the great organiser that he was managed to get on his flight."" 
	Mr Patteson described his friend as a ""really great, confident young man"" who was proud of his British roots. 
	Mr Ayley's wife Sharlene wrote on Facebook: ""Rob was our everything. We adored him and there was no one else like him. He touched so many hearts and lives. 
	""We are grateful to forever have him in our hearts."" 
	Mr Ayley's family said he was passionate about life and his family, adding that when it came to Rob ""there were no half measures"". 
	""He found in his boys two little people he could love, understand and trust,"" they said. 
	""When they cried they were sad, when they laughed they were happy and when they hugged it was because they loved him."" 
	The statement added: ""Sharlene and Rob are soul mates. She is his 'Princess'. She changed his life and he changed hers. 
	""She held his heart and he held hers. Rob will live forever in his family."""

	Barry Sweeney said he was ""hurt"" to have learned the news from a Newcastle United fans website. 
	He had spent Thursday night trying to get through to official sources on ""emergency lines"". 
	Liam Sweeney, who worked night shifts at Morrisons, was travelling with friend John Alder, in his 60s, to see Newcastle United's pre-season tour in New Zealand when the crash occurred. 
	The 28-year-old would have been known to many fans during his time volunteering as a steward on supporters' buses to away games. 
	Asked how he found out, his father told Sky News that he found out the NUFC website, which posted condolences. 
	He said: ""I got a text last night off a friend, saying they’d heard something about a flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, not really thinking much about it. Then I put Sky News on and was watching that. 
	""I rang a couple of numbers, spoke to a Malaysian lady…to be honest with you, a Geordie and a Malaysian lady trying to interact was a little bit difficult, but I gave her my number, hoped somebody would get back to us but they didn’t. 
	""There was a number to text which I tried, nothing there. So basically I found out on NUFC.com this morning. 
	""It was impossible to believe, even when the police came this morning I thought he might have had too much to drink and he didn’t get on the plane but they confirmed that he was on the plane."" 
	Mr Sweeney added that his son was a ""big friendly giant"" who loved football ""probably more than anything"" but ""was always there if you needed him"". 
	In a separate interview the 52-year-old questioned whether he would want to go to the crash site. 
	""Is it worth it to see what I don't really want to see?"" Mr Sweeney said."

	NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said 18 security staff had reported on Friday that they were unable to work due symptoms of the virus, which causes sickness and diarrhoea. 
	And another five security staff called in sick today saying they had also fallen ill. 
	Previously, 32 workers were suspected to have been affected by the virus, but two cases were discounted. 
	They have all been told to stay at home until they are clear of symptoms for 48 hours. 
	A temporary toilet facility, identified the probable source of the outbreak, has been shut at the village in Glasgow's east end where athletes began arriving this week. 
	NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said ""every precaution"" is being taken and ""everyone is being very vigilant"". 
	Public health consultant Dr Gillian Penrice said: ""Village residents and workforce have been informed and issued with health information. 
	""There have been no reports from athletes or team officials and the Village is open and operating as normal. 
	""We continue to monitor the situation closely."" 
	Norovirus is the most common stomach bug in the UK, affecting between 600,000 and one million people of all ages every year. 
	The 700-house Dalmarnock facility was officially opened last Sunday and will host 4,500 competitors and another 2,300 support staff during the Games, which starts on Wednesday. 
	First Minister Alex Salmond said the Games organisers were confident they had identified the probable source of the outbreak - the toilet facility in use during construction work in the security area. 
	Mr Salmond said: ""We're confident we've identified the cause of the outbreak, a temporary facility which was not as it should be. 
	""We've taken the measures necessary. We've got a terrific health service and they are on the job. 
	""We are confident that we're getting to grips with the cause. We will see more cases but it will tail off over the next few days."""

	The Creative Content UK campaign has today announced it will provide £3.5m to help with an education awareness drive launching early next year. 
	It will be aimed at all potential online users, advising about trustworthy sources and giving guidance on internet safety. 
	Another element of the scheme will see some internet providers advising customers if their accounts are thought to be being used to access material which infringes copyright and telling them where they can find legal content. 
	Among those involved are music industry body the BPI, the Motion Picture Association and internet providers such as Sky, BT and Virgin Media. 
	Culture Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""It will play a central role in raising awareness of copyright and pointing people toward legal ways to access content, and I welcome this effort."" 
	Geoff Taylor, the chief executive of the BPI, described the scheme as a ""landmark initiative"", adding: ""It should mark a real step forward for digital entertainment in the UK."" 
	Creative industries are estimated to contribute £71.4bn towards the UK economy. 
	In 2012, annual digital sales of music, video and games broke through the £1bn barrier for the first time. 
	Business Secretary Vince Cable said: ""Education is at the heart of this drive so people understand that piracy isn't a victimless crime - but actually causes business to fail, harms the industry and costs jobs."""
2014-07-19,MPs To Campaign For Comedians... Seriously!,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140719165054/https://news.sky.com/story/1303720/mps-to-campaign-for-comedians-seriously,"By Jon Craig, Chief Political Correspondent Who says politics is no laughing matter? 
	A group of MPs have formed a committee to campaign on behalf of Britain's comedians. 
	The All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on the UK Comedy Industry held its first meeting in the Commons this week and elected Scottish Labour MP Michael McCann as chairman. 
	But it is not just a bunch of MPs sitting around telling jokes. The deadly serious purpose of the group is to support and promote the UK comedy industry. 
	Former Labour minister Lord Foulkes, an ex-chairman of Hearts FC - which certainly requires a sense of humour! - was elected as vice-chair. 
	Tory MP Alec Shelbrooke, who once wore a tiger-striped onesie in the Commons and on TV for charity, is another vice-chair and Labour MP David Hamilton (not the TV funny man and Ken Dodd sidekick of the same name) is the group's secretary. 
	The meeting heard from comedian John Moloney about the industry's importance to the country's finances; its economic value, in terms of films, television and the money stand-up comedy generates for local economies. 
	""This a massive industry, yet, for the most part its contribution goes unrecognised and unsupported,"" he said. 
	""The creative industries in Britain employ more people than the engineering industry or the pharmaceutical industry"" 
	Mr McCann said: ""There are literally hundreds of All Party Parliamentary Groups covering a plethora of subjects. 
	""However, I was surprised to learn when John put the idea to me that there is no APPG supporting the UK Comedy industry. 
	""It seemed rather odd not to celebrate and promote the work of such an important British institution, so we've remedied that omission by starting up this new APPG. 
	""But the group is about much more than just celebrating the successes, it's about tackling serious issues. 
	""For example, British comedians have difficulty getting visas to work in the USA, Canada and Australia, while the comedians from those countries can work here, why? 
	""In addition, there is a VAT issue around selling tickets for comedy shows which means that there are treated differently to other creative industries, again an anomaly that needs to be examined. 
	""As a Parliamentarian I'm delighted to be given the opportunity to be the first chair of the UK Comedy APPG. 
	""Our country is very good at delivering top class comedians. We should celebrate our successes and tackle industry problems because comedy is a serious business."" 
	In other words, this new group is no joke."
2014-07-19,Newly-Listed TSB Says Yes To £1.4bn UKAR Bid,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140719165054/https://news.sky.com/story/1303941/newly-listed-tsb-says-yes-to-1-4bn-ukar-bid,"By Mark Kleinman, City Editor TSB Banking Group, the UK's seventh-biggest lender, is plotting an audacious takeover bid for a £1.5bn taxpayer-owned mortgage portfolio just weeks after floating on the London Stock Exchange. 
	Sky News has learnt that TSB's chief executive Paul Pester has expressed an interest in acquiring the residential loan book from UK Asset Resolution, the Government's 'bad bank', which was put up for sale last month. 
	The move is designed to accelerate TSB's expansion at a time when its growth prospects are expected to be hampered by a continuing period of low interest rates. 
	The bank, which has 631 branches and about 4.5m customers, has pledged to distinguish itself from competitors by shunning investment banking activities and reforming the way it pays top executives. 
	News of TSB's interest in the UKAR loan-book comes the day after Britain's competition watchdog said it was minded to order a full investigation into the personal current account and small business banking sectors amid signs that both were insufficiently competitive. 
	TSB continues to be majority-owned by Lloyds Banking Group, the country's biggest high street lender, which is itself 25%-owned by UK taxpayers. 
	Lloyds sold 38.5% of TSB in last month's flotation for 260p-a-share, and is supposed to offload the remainder by the end of next year to comply with European state aid rules. 
	TSB's flotation is likely to pave the way for a string of initial public offerings (IPOs) by so-called challenger banks during the next year, with Aldermore, Shawbrook and Virgin Money all examining moves to go public. 
	TSB was originally going to be sold to the Co-operative Group prior to the emergence of a £1.5bn black hole on the mutually owned bank's balance sheet. 
	The UKAR mortgage auction represents the first such transaction since July 2012, when UKAR agreed the sale of £465m of Northern Rock Asset Management (NRAM) loans to Virgin Money. 
	The proceeds of that sale were used to repay part of NRAM's loan from the Government, which enabled it to stave off outright collapse in 2008. 
	News of the latest sale process was revealed by Sky News on the same day that UKAR trumpeted its return to the taxpayer of roughly a quarter of the nearly £50bn it borrowed six years ago. 
	The state-owned organisation subsequently confirmed the intention to sell the mortgage portfolio, saying in a statement last month: ""The completion of any sale will not affect the terms and conditions of the mortgages sold, and the continued fair treatment of customers will be a key consideration for UKAR in assessing the merits of a sale. 
	""The proposed sale is in line with UKAR's strategy and is part of the orderly wind-down of the closed mortgage books of both B&B and NRAM. UKAR will only complete the transaction if the sale price achieved represents value to the taxpayer."" 
	Richard Banks, UKAR chief executive, said its financial results represented ""good progress"" but warned that a rise in interest rates would be a significant obstacle for many of its 467,000 customers. 
	TSB, shares in which closed on Friday at 284.75p, giving it a value of just over £1.4bn, declined to comment."
2014-07-19,Polar Bear Inquest: 'No Neglect' Over Death,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140719165054/https://news.sky.com/story/1303517/polar-bear-inquest-no-neglect-over-death,"A coroner has cleared an expedition company of neglect over its responsibility
to protect a boy mauled to death by a polar bear. 
	Ian Singleton, assistant coroner for Wiltshire and Swindon, returned a narrative verdict at the conclusion of a five-day long inquest into the death of Horatio Chapple. 
	Horatio died on an adventure holiday to the remote Svalbard islands in August 2011 with the British Schools Exploring Society (BSES) - now renamed the British Exploring Society (BES). 
	The coroner found that although the group were missing items of equipment including parts of the tripwire alert system, BSES had not acted with ""neglect"". 
	He said: ""I do not find that neglect is appropriate to be considered, as failure (by BSES) was not total or complete."" 
	The Eton schoolboy, from Salisbury, Wiltshire, was sleeping in his tent when the bear went on the rampage, inflicting fatal injuries to his head and upper body on the morning of August 5. 
	Four others were hurt before the bear was shot dead at the camp site where the group, known as Chanzin Fire, had been staying. 
	Also injured during the incident were trip leader Michael ""Spike"" Reid, from Plymouth, Devon, Andrew Ruck, from Brighton, Patrick Flinders, from Jersey, and Scott Bennell-Smith, from St Mellion in Cornwall. 
	In his narrative verdict, Mr Singleton said: ""On the 5th August 2011, Horatio Chapple was in a tent on a snow bridge near to the Von Post Glacier in Svalbard, Norway, as part of an expedition. 
	""A polar bear was able to enter the camp shortly before 7.30am undetected as the tripwire alarm system around the perimeter of the camp had failed to activate due to a supporting post more likely than not being knocked over by the bear which caused the cartridge to move or fall out of the mine without it detonating. 
	""Horatio emerged from his tent and was in the act of standing up when the bear reared up and slammed down on him with its paws pushing Horatio to the ground where the bear then mauled his head, face and neck causing the injury which lead to Horatio's death. 
	""At the time of the attack the polar bear was 24 years of age, hungry and in pain from bad teeth which more likely than not made it more aggressive and unpredictable."" 
	The Salisbury inquest heard that the tripwire system provided by BSES worked ""inconsistently"" and had missing parts. 
	This meant it had to be set up in triangle shapes rather than the expected larger rectangles and that group members had modified the triggering mechanism using paper clips. 
	Also, the inquest was told that the group members were also expected to be kitted out with pen flares to scare off a bear. 
	But there were insufficient available and were only distributed with the group leaders. 
	The hearing was also told that Mr Reid attempted to shoot the bear with the group's Mauser 98K but his first attempts were unsuccessful. 
	This was because the safety catch mechanism ejected the rounds rather than firing them."
2014-07-19,Grangemouth Should Not Be About Referendum,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140719165054/https://news.sky.com/story/1302764/grangemouth-should-not-be-about-referendum,"By Niall Paterson, Sky Correspondent Fantastic news for the Scottish economy, says the Chief Secretary to the Treasury. 
	Fantastic news for the thousands of workers at Grangemouth and elsewhere whose jobs have been protected, according to site owners Ineos. 
	And what a fantastic coincidence that the announcement comes on the day that First Minister Alex Salmond is due to make a speech in England on the problems often faced by businesses in the regions. 
	Undoubtedly the new shale gas import and storage facility means much greater hope for a long and prosperous future for the refinery. 
	Cheap ethane from the United States will be welcomed with open arms if, as many expect, North Sea oil production begins to wane and rising energy costs cut into margins. 
	But the fact that materials for what will be Europe's largest ethane storage tank have already been purchased, and that work on its construction will begin immediately, should be enough to tell you this loan guarantee hasn't happened overnight. 
	Just last year, Ineos' chairman was threatening to close the Grangemouth facility, claiming it was unprofitable. 
	A deal was eventually struck to secure its future, with workers accepting some pretty hefty changes to pay and conditions, and the Government indicating it would support the shift to shale. 
	And what of that Government support? Danny Alexander hasn't found £230m down the back of the Treasury sofa to give to Ineos. He isn't even lending them the money. 
	The Government is simply underwriting a public bonds issue - essentially acting as guarantor. 
	It's fine for politicians to be proud of their achievements, even to crow about them on occasion. 
	But let's be clear - backing infrastructure projects like this, particularly ones which increase the UK's energy security, is what governments are supposed to do. 
	These days everything is seen through the prism of the referendum and, as ministers continue to emphasise the economic benefits of the union, it is to be expected that Westminster will (albeit tangentially) use the guarantee as evidence of that. 
	The First Minister would no doubt argue that in the event of an independent Scotland, he would provide similar support."

	While most Westminster watchers were focusing on who got what job, for the Daily Mail it was all about the ""Battle of the Downing Street catwalk"". 
	(If you're interested, Esther McVey won.) 
	The newspaper also approved of Penny Mordaunt's ""tight, bright purple dress"" but thought Liz Truss looked ""a little bit too Eighties air hostess."" 
	Needless to say, Twitter was not impressed. Even the newspaper's former Business Correspondent said it was ""demeaning."" 
	Despite the outrage, the ""Queen of the Downing Street catwalk"" Esther McVey (otherwise known as the Employment Minister) shrugged off the coverage. 
	She told Sky News that it was fantastic to see women in powerful positions in newspapers. 
	Meanwhile, Jacqui Smith provided a dose of reality on Boulton and Co: ""There was four women in the Cabinet, now there are five. It’s hardly a feminist take-over is it?"" 
	In the interests of equality, attention soon turned to the men. The only problem was … they all appeared to be wearing exactly the same outfit. 
	(Apart from John Hayes and Desmond Swayne who – rather sportingly – wore jaunty hats.) 
	But it was the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg who posted the funniest tweet of the day, with a post saying: ""What I wore to the office today. Fingers cross the Mail approves. Hope it's not too '80s cabin attendant."" 
	If he had added a pair of nude heels and an oversized handbag, the Daily Mail might have crowned him the King of the Catwalk."
2014-07-19,Female Line-Up An Attempt To Win Votes,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140719165054/https://news.sky.com/story/1301368/female-line-up-an-attempt-to-win-votes,"By Anushka Asthana, Political Correspondent If there was going to be a Cabinet cull it was always likely to focus on middle-aged or older white men. 
	After all it is they who have dominated David Cameron's top table. 
	Of the 22 full members of Cabinet until Monday, only three were female and none mothers. 
	So the first half of today's narrative - centring on those who have lost their jobs - was always set in stone. 
	In reality, the second part of the story - those who have benefitted - is a mixed one. Philip Hammond and Michael Fallon are - yes, you've guessed it - white men. 
	But it is clear that women have been big winners too. 
	Mr Cameron has increased the number of full members of Cabinet who are female from three to five, bringing in Nicky Morgan and Elizabeth Truss. With Baroness Stowell of Beeston and Esther McVey also attending Cabinet, it doubles the number of women at the table from four to eight. 
	So why has the Prime Minister embarked on this hefty change? 
	Lord Ashcroft, the Tory peer who carries out extensive polling across the country, crudely says it is about ""optics"" rather than ""ability"". In truth, the women who have moved up the ranks are perfectly competent. 
	But it is true that this Cabinet reshuffle is less about Downing Street and more about Conservative Campaign Headquarters. It is less about policy-making and more about campaigning. 
	After all, this is the fourth year of a five-year Parliament - the focus in departments is now on implementation. 
	Instead, the Prime Minister is thinking about next May. 
	As one Tory source tells me ""this is a war-time Cabinet"" ready for a General Election. The key characteristic among its members is that they are ""disciplined campaigners"". 
	That, the source tells me, is the main reason Ken Clarke is out. His ""freelancing"" in radio interviews about his views on Europe that weren't always helpful to the Prime Minister was starting to grate. As the big vote approaches they can’t be tolerated, according to the strategists at the top of the party. 
	Lord Ashcroft is right that ""optics"" matter. These figures will be the ones we see on our television screens time and again between now and the election. They have to be persuasive, and offer appeal, particularly for female voters among whom Labour are solidly ahead. 
	Lord Ashcroft is half right. The Prime Minister has brought able women to the top of Government at least in part because of the perception it creates among voters. 
	It is about optics more than policy."

	The 18-year-old was found with a single gunshot wound to the head.   
	An earlier inquest into her death recorded an open verdict, but two High Court judges quashed that on Friday due to ""an insufficiency of inquiry"". 
	Judge Peter Thornton QC said ""the discovery of new facts or evidence"" made ""a fresh investigation, including a fresh inquest, necessary or desirable in the interests of justice"". 
	Des and Doreen James applied for a new inquest after the Human Rights Act was used to get access to documents about their daughter's death. 
	""When young people die in violent circumstances, a rigorous and transparent investigation should be automatic,"" they said in a statement. 
	""Something went dreadfully wrong at Deepcut, yet until now no-one has bothered to look at how and why our daughter died. 
	""We can only hope that Cheryl's legacy helps change the current ineffective and discredited military justice system."" 
	Pte James was one of four soldiers who died at the barracks in Surrey between 1995 and 2002, as claims of bullying and abuse emerged. 
	Privates Sean Benton, James Collinson and Geoff Gray also died from gunshot wounds. 
	Pte James was found in a small wooded area close to the gate where she had been posted, alone. 
	In the subsequent investigation, the fragmented bullet from her head was not examined and was later lost. Also lost were the bullet's casing, other bullets in the rifle and Pte James' clothing. 
	""Her rifle was not examined forensically. No fingerprints were taken from it. No gunshot residue tests were made,"" Judge Thornton said."

	The winning menus were chosen by former Army Major Tim and world-renowned chef Heston Blumenthal, who will invite the designers to work with him and turn their ideas into real space food. 
	""I'm incredibly impressed with the creative and mouth-watering entries we've received from children all over the UK,"" said Tim. 
	""I'm really looking forward to enjoying a Great British Space Dinner on board the International Space Station. (It) will be a very special link back to planet Earth!"" 
	Mr Blumenthal added: ""This has been such an amazing experience. The students are quite possibly the next great chefs or scientists of tomorrow. 
	""I cannot wait to work with them in the Experimental Kitchen and see their final dishes. Tim is undoubtedly in for a treat on his upcoming space mission!"" 
	The winning entries were:

2014-07-19,Four Men Jailed For British Aid Worker's Murder,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140719165054/https://news.sky.com/story/1303462/four-men-jailed-for-british-aid-workers-murder,"Four men have been sentenced to 20 years hard labour for the murder of a British aid worker and the rape of his Russian fiancee. 
	Khuram Shaikh, 32, was stabbed to death on Christmas Day 2011 at a hotel while on holiday in Sri Lanka. 
	The Red Cross worker's fiancee was beaten unconscious before being sexually assaulted. 
	Colombo High Court has sentenced the four, including Sampath Vidanapathirana, a ruling party supporter and head of the council in Tangalle town, where the two were staying, to ""rigorous imprisonment"" for 20 years. 
	Judge Rohini Walgama also fined them 20,000 rupees (£87) each and ordered them to pay 200,000 rupees (£87,000) each in compensation. 
	Shaikh's fiancee, who can not be identified under Sri Lankan law, was in court and seen wiping away tears as the verdict was delivered. 
	The aid worker's brother, Nasir Shaikh, was also in court. 
	He said: ""I am pleased that those who killed my brother have been punished and will be behind bars for a long time. 
	""Our campaign was not only about justice, but to bring awareness of the humanitarian work my brother did as a Red Cross worker. 
	""He is a true inspiration for many and he was respected all around the world because of the work he did."" 
	Local MP Simon Danczuk said: ""Nearly three years ago now Khuram's father asked me if I would help to get justice for his son and we've fought very hard to get this result. 
	""The fact that a prominent politician is now behind bars is extremely significant and many Sri Lankan journalists told me this would not happen. 
	""I hope it marks a turning point for Sri Lankan justice and sends out a message that no one is above the law."" 
	Britain’s High Commission in Colombo said: ""The officials of the Attorney General's office have shown great professionalism and integrity and we would like to thank them."" 
	President Mahinda Rajapaksa's government came under criticism over delays in bringing the case to trial. The government had said delays were unavoidable due to forensic work. 
	Friction between Sri Lanka and Britain over the murder case had grown before a summit of the Commonwealth group of countries in Colombo last November."
2014-07-19,House of Lords Debates Assisted Dying Bill,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140719165054/https://news.sky.com/story/1303428/house-of-lords-debates-assisted-dying-bill,"By Anushka Asthana, Political Correspondent The debate is likely to run all day, until eight at night, with each peer given a few minutes to make a case. 
	Proponents will argue that it is cruel to prevent people facing a painful death to take their lives early with the help of doctors and loved ones. 
	But those opposing the policy told Sky News that disabled people face misdiagnoses at the end of life, and feel pressured into taking their lives because they don't want to become a burden on their families. 
	They fear this legislation could lead to a ""slippery slope"". 
	Among those supporting Lord Falconer are Steve Riley-Snelling, who watched his wife, Tracy, die screaming in agony in his arms. 
	When Tracy Snelling was diagnosed last year with terminal stomach cancer she said she wanted to marry her long-term partner Steve, and then die peacefully. 
	She was willing to travel to Dignitas, an assisted dying clinic in Switzerland, but after the wedding was too sick. Steve told Sky News that no nurse would come with them because it was illegal. 
	As she deteriorated, he told her he could end it by putting his hand over her mouth and nose, but felt he couldn't because it would be against the law. 
	He begged nurses to help on her final day, when she was vomiting blood out of her mouth and nose, but they refused. 
	Steve - who will take a seat in the Lords today - said a change in law could have granted his wife her final wish - a good death. 
	""This campaign is not about forcing people to die, it's not about the disabled or the elderly being compelled to die,"" he said. 
	""This debate is about people who are already condemned to die because they are terminally ill like Tracy was. Tracy did not want to die."" 
	He said his wife - who was a senior figure in a major bank - was desperate to live. 
	But opponents argue this is not just about cancer sufferers. 
	Paralympian peer Tanni Grey-Thompson told Sky News there were a wide range of disabilities with which people could be told they were close to death at a bad time of year - but then survive for many more years. 
	She said that had happened to another peer - Baroness Campbell - who will be speaking in the debate as well. 
	She also argued that she feared a ""slippery slope"" - pointing to how the abortion bill began as a very specific piece of legislation and then slowly widened with time. 
	Opponents could put up a ""wrecking amendment"" to stop the legislation but sources say they are unlikely to do so, partly because of a desire to have the debate. 
	There are also fears they could lose the vote. But they will hope that the legislation will not turn into law because there is insufficient time before the general election."
2014-07-19,UK Couple 'Shaken' After Missing Doomed Flight,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140719165054/https://news.sky.com/story/1303192/uk-couple-shaken-after-missing-doomed-flight,"A British family scheduled to fly on the downed Malaysia Airlines plane say they have a ""second chance"" at life after being forced to miss the flight because there were not enough seats. 
	Barry Sim, from Scotland, his wife Izzy, and the couple's young child were travelling to Amsterdam's Schiphol airport in a taxi on Thursday evening when they heard about the crash. 
	They had been due to catch flight MH17 to Malaysia earlier in the day, but were told they would have to switch to another plane. 
	Cradling her baby at the airport, Mrs Sim said: ""I'm shaken. I don't even know what to do. I feel physically sick. 
	""I was coming from the Hilton (hotel) in The Hague to the airport in the taxi and I was just crying. 
	""I'm just thinking that I feel like I've been given a second chance, so hopefully we will get there (to Malaysia) safely and we will see my family again."" 
	The couple told the Daily Telegraph they were forced to swap to a KLM flight bound for Kuala Lumpur as there were too few seats for them and their baby. 
	Mr Sim told the newspaper he also felt ""sick"" after hearing about his family's lucky escape, but added that he wanted to carry on with his life. 
	""In my mind lightning never strikes twice in the same place, so I am still philosophical that you get on the flight and you go about your life,"" Mr Sim told the newspaper. 
	Flight MH17 was heading from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur at an altitude of 33,000ft (10,000m) when contact was lost yesterday afternoon. 
	The plane crashed near the border with Russia. There were nine Britons among the 283 passengers and 15 crew members on board. 
	An adviser to the Ukrainian interior ministry said the Boeing 777 had been hit by a Buk ground-to-air missile. 
	US intelligence has also concluded a surface-to-air missile brought the plane down, but it is not clear who is responsible for the tragedy. 
	Crash investigators have been given access to the site and journalists have been encouraged to take pictures, many of which are too graphic to show. 
	A video which has emerged of a massive fireball shooting into the air - the apparent moment the plane was blown out of the sky - features three men, reported to be pro-Russian rebels, talking about the explosion. 
	Before the flight set off from Amsterdam, a young Dutchman posted a picture of the jet on Facebook, writing: ""If it should disappear, this is what it looks like."""
2014-07-19,Couple In Court For Taking Children To Memorial,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140719165054/https://news.sky.com/story/1303458/couple-in-court-for-taking-children-to-memorial,"By Emma Birchley, East of England Correspondent A mother and father have pleaded not guilty in court after refusing to pay a £60 fine for failing to make sure their son attended school, in what is being seen as a test case. 
	City banker James Haymore and his wife, Dana, were represented by the human rights charity Liberty when they appeared during a short hearing at Colchester Magistrates Court. 
	The family believes it was a breach of their human rights for Chancellor Park Primary School in Chelmsford to refuse to allow their children to attend a memorial service for their great-grandfather in the United States. 
	The Haymores, who moved to the UK from the US four years ago, decided to go anyway, extending their three children's Christmas holiday by six days. 
	But, under tough rules brought in by the former education secretary Michael Gove in September 2013, headteachers can only authorise time off in ""exceptional circumstances"". 
	The charge relates to the Haymores' eldest child Toby, 11, who, the court was told, went to school on 146 out of a possible 168 days between November 4, 2013 and March 21, 2014. It equates to an 87% attendance record. 
	Rosie Brighouse, legal officer at Liberty, said in a statement outside court, that ""common sense must prevail"". 
	She said: ""Is criminalising parents for taking their children out of school for momentous family events really the best use of council resources, court time and public money? 
	""The rules that lead to the Haymores' ordeal and Liberty's clients' ordeal go no way toward addressing the deeper and more complex social problems that contribute to some children repeatedly missing school."" 
	Parents who do not have permission but still take their children out of school can be given a £60 fine per child, increasing to £120 if it is not paid within 21 days. 
	If no payment is received after 28 days, then prosecution can follow. 
	In this case, the maximum sentence is £1,000. 
	The Haymores are due back in court for a two-day trial starting on October 10."

	The London 2012 gold medallist announced the birth via her official Twitter page. 
	""Our beautiful baby boy Reggie Ennis-Hill was born yesterday (Thursday). We couldn't be happier,"" she said. 
	Ennis-Hill, 28, who is married to husband Andy, revealed her pregnancy in January. 
	It ruled her out of the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, which begin next week. 
	Fellow athletes took to Twitter to congratulate the athlete, including her British rival Katarina Johnson-Thompson. 
	Ennis-Hill has said she is ""100% set on returning to full-time athletics"" after the birth, and hopes to compete at the Rio Olympics in 2016. 
	Speaking earlier this year about her long-term sporting plans, Ennis-Hill said she was aiming to come back to athletics in late 2015. 
	""It's very difficult to set a plan in stone at this point, I have to take it as it comes for the next few weeks and months and be very careful when I build back into full training,"" she said. 
	""I've got to make sure I do that properly to avoid injuries and setbacks. Hopefully, come the end of next year I'll be back into the full swing of things, a full programme, pretty much as I was before."""

	All of them are former teachers or pupils from Knowl View, a former residential school for boys in Rochdale. 
	Police say they have been interviewed about a variety of offences, including the sexual or physical abuse of children between 1969 and 1990. 
	Eighteen victims have come forward alleging they were abused at the school. 
	Greater Manchester Police said a ""handful"" claim the offences were committed by Smith. 
	Detective Chief Superintendent Russ Jackson, said: ""The investigation into abuse at Knowl View School continues and since the start of the inquiry further victims have come forward. 
	""These are serious allegations made against both staff and pupils at the school and are being thoroughly investigated. 
	""We are currently working through the allegations and as a result 14 people so far have been interviewed under caution. 
	""Greater Manchester Police takes allegations of abuse very seriously and continues to do so and if anyone has been a victim of abuse, we ask them to contact us.""

2014-07-19,Retail Banks Face Competitiveness Probe,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140719165054/https://news.sky.com/story/1303205/retail-banks-face-competitiveness-probe,"The competition watchdog has confirmed it is consulting on a provisional decision to launch an in-depth investigation into the retail banking sector. 
	The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said essential parts of the UK market lack effective competitiveness. 
	The CMA said the existing structure did not meet the needs of consumers or that required by small and medium-sized enterprises (SME). 
	It said there will now be a consultation for an in-depth market investigation for personal current accounts and SME banking. 
	The watchdog said despite claims of competitiveness, customers have not benefited sufficiently from attempts to open up the market. 
	Recent changes have included a simplification of switching current accounts between providers. 
	The CMA said it would possibly launch a full-scale market investigation but has told the ""big four"" banks - Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland - to offer an industry solution. 
	It said a formal decision on the investigation would be made in the autumn. 
	The current account sector is around £8bn in size, while the SME sector is worth £2bn. 
	The watchdog commissioned two reports, one into current accounts and the other into SME functionality. 
	The SME banking market study was a joint project with the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). 
	It was the first formal collaboration between the organisations since the CMA was formed following a merging of the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission. 
	The CMA said it was interested in hearing from consumers and companies about their experiences. 
	It said there appeared to be limited scope for newer and smaller banks and the markets remain concentrated, particularly in Scotland and Northern Ireland. 
	It added that there was very little movement in the market share of the largest banks - other than as a result of mergers and acquisitions. 
	The CMA said many customers see little difference between the largest banks in terms of the services they offer. 
	In addition, it said limited transparency and difficulties for customers in making comparisons between banks, particularly for overdraft charges, are ""very complex"". 
	""This makes it hard for customers to choose the cheapest or most appropriate accounts for them, so limiting banks' incentives to compete,"" the CMA said. 
	""This may result in higher overdraft charges than would otherwise be the case."""

	CCTV shows two men standing next to each other in Bloom Street, embracing briefly before the victim turns to walk away. 
	But just two seconds later, he is hit by a slab of concrete hidden in the back of the other man's trousers. 
	The attacker can be seen skipping away and gesturing with his hands, as the victim stumbles backwards onto the pavement. 
	A man arrested on suspicion of assault shortly after the attack has been released on bail until September 2 while investigations continue. 
	However, police have not been able to trace the victim and are concerned he may have suffered head injuries. 
	Detective Constable Tom Hornby, of Greater Manchester Police, said: ""This was a cowardly and unprovoked assault and we desperately need to identify this man in order to check on his welfare. 
	""We also need to trace him because at this time we are effectively dealing with a victimless crime, which is clearly not the case. 
	""We need to take an account of what happened from him and record his injuries so we can properly and thoroughly investigate this matter and bring the offender to justice."" 
	The victim is thought to have left in a taxi shortly after the attack at around 4.35am on Wednesday. 
	He is described as black, aged in his mid to late 20s and of medium build, and was wearing a white t-shirt, black top, jeans and black shoes. 
	Anyone with information is asked to call police on 0161 856 39597. Alternatively, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
