2014-11-04,"For a man who would prefer to remain in the shadows, he's got an incendiary turn of phrase.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20141104160633/http://news.sky.com/story/1366544/gchq-shouldnt-have-unfettered-access-to-data,"For a man who would prefer to remain in the shadows, he's got an incendiary turn of phrase. Social media, he said, is the ""command and control networks of choice for terrorists and criminals"". Technology companies, said Robert Hannigan, are ""in denial about its misuse"". And the new head of GCHQ, has called for ""a more sustainable relationship between the (intelligence) agencies and the technology companies. Mr Hannigan started his new role on Monday ""Increasingly their services not only host the material of violent or child exploitation…,"" ah pity - that's where the argument for greater government access to the data on users of social media begins to collapse. In invoking visceral fears of child molesters, the head of the UK's surveillance agency is preying on the nation's deep dark fears to seek national permission to snoop into every corner of our lives. I'm reminded at this point of a private conversation I had with a Cabinet minister who was pushing the Communications Data Bill - which has since been shelved. ""If you’ve got nothing to hide you have nothing to fear,"" the minister said. Really? ""Paedophile rings and terrorists are getting ahead of us. We need to get access to their data to prevent their attacks,"" the minister added. One can safely assume that the new GCHQ boss, Mr Hannigan, and the minister are entirely decent people with a dependable grasp of the notion that free speech is the blood of democracy. But whatever the horrors that terrorists have in store for us, the spies have not made the strategic case for the abandoned ""Snoopers' Charter"" or for even wider powers to suborn the private sector into conducting surveillance of its own clients. ""Trust me"" isn't a good enough position to take when the spy agencies have been exposed for the bugging of allies and the wholesale mining of private communications. In the UK they don't even face judicial oversight when dipping into phone and internet data. Warrants are issued by ministers, not magistrates. Mr Hannigan argues that Islamic State, also known as ISIS, has ""embraced the web as a noisy channel in which to promote itself"" and that GCHQ, MI5 and the Secret Intelligence Service cannot ""tackle these challenges at scale without greater support from the private sector"". That is obviously a Bad Thing. But so is a licence to almost unlimited plunder of private data because it won't just be the ""trustworthy"" Western powers that demand it. If gobble, faceache, twaddle, whatsit, and instabore were to agree to share their data with Western spooks, they would have to open their servers to the scrutiny of China, to Russia, or North Korea too. The spy chief is angry that Islamic State has harnessed the borderless freedom of the internet to its own advantage. So should anyone be who is repulsed by the videos of mass murder and beheading it has been sending out. But that isn't an argument for censorship or the unfettered right for spy agencies to mine our metadata and peek into our online lives. They cannot and should not be trusted to do that."

2014-11-04,"Overtime should be taken into account when holiday pay is calculated, the Employment Appeal Tribunal has ruled.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20141104160633/http://news.sky.com/story/1366498/holiday-pay-should-include-overtime,"Overtime should be taken into account when holiday pay is calculated, the Employment Appeal Tribunal has ruled. The tribunal ruled on two cases against Hertel UK and BEAR Scotland, which related to the UK's interpretation of the Working Time Directive. Workers for these companies claimed their holiday pay was less than it should have been because their employers did not factor in voluntary overtime completed in the period prior to time off. Brian Gordon, managing director BEAR Scotland, said they were ""disappointed"" by the decision. “We believe that this interpretation of the Working Time Directive is significant for all UK employers, public and private, and we will reflect on our position before considering how to respond,” he said But unions welcomed the ruling, with Unite executive director Howard Beckett saying: ""Up until now some workers who are required to do overtime have been penalised for taking the time off they are entitled to. ""This ruling not only secures justice for our members who were short changed, but means employers have got to get their house in order."" Business groups have described the ruling as a ""blow"" to business, with Confederation of British Industry director-general John Cridland warning of ""punitive costs potentially running into billions of pounds"". ""Not all will survive - which could mean significant job losses,"" he said. ""These cases are creating major uncertainty for businesses and impacting on investment and resourcing decisions. ""We need the UK Government to step up its defence of the current UK law, and use its powers to limit any retrospective liability that firms may face."" Tim Thomas, head of employment policy for manufacturers' organisation EEF, said firms will have little option but to factor the additional costs in to future pay negotiations and to reduce overtime, while one in four could cut jobs. Some businesses had already prepared for the worst, with John Lewis setting aside £40 million to reimburse workers.  Business Secretary Vince Cable told Sky News: ""Our preliminary assessment is that the impact is likely to be modest."" When asked by Business Presenter Ian King whether the ruling could lead to job losses, he said: ""If there is a very substantial cost to business, then that may well be the result, and we would very much regret that."" The Lib Dem confirmed a taskforce has been set up to discuss how to limit the impact of the decision for businesses, adding: ""Employers and workers can also contact the Acas helpline for free and confidential advice."""
2014-11-04,"Former directors of Phones 4U, the mobile phone retailer which collapsed earlier this year with the loss of thousands of jobs, face a probe into their conduct led by one of America's top law firms.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20141104160633/http://news.sky.com/story/1366660/former-phones-4u-directors-face-legal-probe,"By Mark Kleinman, City Editor Former directors of Phones 4U, the mobile phone retailer which collapsed earlier this year with the loss of thousands of jobs, face a probe into their conduct led by one of America's top law firms. Sky News has learnt that Quinn Emanuel Urquhart and Sullivan, which has been appointed by the chain's administrator, will also examine the conduct of two mobile phone networks which severed their ties with Phones 4U in the weeks leading to its demise. The appointment of Quinn Emanuel by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) could lead to legal action against former bosses if there is deemed to be a legitimate claim against them for breaching their fiduciary duties as company directors. PwC is understood to have appointed the law firm late last week, although progress in assessing any action against former directors or suppliers is likely to be painstaking. There is not thought to be any evidence at this stage that the directors of Phones 4U neglected their obligations under companies law. Among the former directors were two representatives of BC Partners, the private equity firm which owned the retailer at the time of its collapse. Phones 4U fell into administration in September after EE, the chain's last remaining network partner, informed it that it would not be renewing their distribution agreement. Vodafone had terminated its own deal with Phones 4U just weeks earlier. Bondholders owed hundreds of millions of pounds were furious at the nature of the collapse, arguing that administrators should have been called in earlier in order to conserve cash, while John Caudwell, Phones 4U's founder, accused the mobile networks of ""ruthless"" behaviour. After PwC's appointment, Vodafone, EE and Dixons Carphone struck deals to acquire various Phones 4U assets, preserving more than 2,000 jobs, but close to 3,000 employees have been made redundant and several hundred shops have been closed. Approximately 520 staff continued to work at Phones4U last month on the wind-down of the company's operations. Sky News revealed in September that Vodafone had held brief talks about a takeover of Phones 4U just two months before it pulled the plug on their relationship. Documents seen by Sky News show that, on 8 July, while discussions were taking place about extending Vodafone's distribution contract with Phones 4U, the mobile network's UK executives made a presentation to group colleagues entitled ""Phones 4U - Partner of Choice"". Several weeks later, Vodafone notified Phones 4U that it would not be renewing their agreement, while no further talks about a takeover of the company were held. The networks denied attempting to profiteer from the retailer's collapse. A PwC spokesman confirmed Quinn Emanuel's appointment, which adds to the ranks of leading law firms involved in one of the biggest UK company collapses of the year. Brown Rudnick, another firm, was appointed by a group of bondholders, while Allen & Overy worked for PwC on potential claims."
2014-11-04,The new head of GCHQ has accused social media websites of helping terror groups and called for closer ties with intelligence agencies.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20141104160633/http://news.sky.com/story/1366165/gchq-chief-says-social-media-aids-terrorists,"The new head of GCHQ has accused social media websites of helping terror groups and called for closer ties with intelligence agencies. Robert Hannigan, who began his new role at the UK's eavesdropping agency on Monday, said US technology companies must work more closely with intelligence agencies to prevent terrorists from misusing their services to avoid surveillance. In an article in the Financial Times, he said: ""However much they [tech companies] may dislike it, they have become the command and control networks of choice for terrorists and criminals, who find their services as transformational as the rest of us."" Robert Hannigan wants closer ties between tech firms and security agencies He added that GCHQ, MI5 and SIS ""cannot tackle these challenges at scale without greater support ... including [from] the largest US tech companies which dominate the web"". Islamic State militants have been using the likes of Twitter and YouTube to post material online, including videos of the murders of British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning and US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff in Syria. Mr Hannigan said that smartphone and other mobile technologies increased the opportunities for terrorist activity to be concealed in the wake of the exposing of secret cables and documents collected by US and UK authorities by whistleblower Edward Snowden. He called for better arrangements to allow security and intelligence agencies to police online traffic. Jamie Bartlett, author of the book The Dark Net: Inside The Digital Underworld, said it was a difficult issue for internet service providers. He told Sky News: ""It is incredibly difficult for them [intelligence agencies] and the police and indeed on the big internet service providers to actually get a handle on just how much propaganda, how much material is being produced and shared by Islamic State and other terrorist groups on these platforms. ""What we've seen with Islamic State and indeed every other terrorist group is quite a sophisticated way of avoiding censorship. ""Islamic State has been really very good at creating hundreds of different accounts on Twitter and Facebook and every time they're closed down, they simply start again."" Emma Carr, director of Big Brother Watch, denied internet companies were failing to assist in investigations. She said: ""The Government and agencies have consistently failed to provide evidence that internet companies are being actively obstructive. ""These companies have consistently proved through their own transparency reports that they help the intelligence agencies when it is appropriate for them to do so, which is in the vast majority of cases."""

The Liberal Democrat crime prevention minister is stepping down after a year of internal battles with Mrs May. He is being replaced as Home Office minister by fellow Lib Dem Lynne Featherstone. Last week, Mr Baker became embroiled in a fresh disagreement over drugs policy and accused the Tories of suppressing a report which backed his case for a review of the current law. Mr Baker said: ""I'm afraid that the Home Secretary, who I think is a formidable woman and a very competent Home Secretary, has one great drawback, which is that she regards this a Conservative department in a Conservative government and it's not. Mr Baker accused the Tories of suppressing a drugs report ""It's a Coalition department in a Coalition government and I'm afraid that mindset has rather soured things."" He added:  ""Clearly, there were issues which were in my portfolio which I wanted to take forward and under normal circumstances in any other department I would have been allowed to progress and really there were obstacles put in the way sometimes. ""Her special advisers, in particular, were scrutinising what I was doing and they tried to minimise my room for manoeuvre."" Mr Baker told The Independent the experience of working at the department was like ""walking through mud"" as he found his plans thwarted by her and her advisers. The Lib Dem MP also accused Mrs May of viewing her Coalition colleagues as ""a cuckoo in the nest rather than part of Government"". David Cameron said: ""Obviously, it's a matter for him [Mr Baker] and the Liberal Democrats and I'm sure the new minister will get on with the job. ""But overall, I think the Home Office has got a good record."" The Prime Minister also said: ""I have worked with Theresa May for eight or nine years now. She is a very effective politician, a very effective administrator."" In his resignation letter to party leader Nick Clegg, Mr Baker said: ""I regret that in the Home Office, the goodwill to work collegiately to take forward rational evidence-based policy has been in somewhat short supply. ""I have concluded, therefore, that for the time being at least, my time is better spent out of ministerial office. ""You will of course continue to have my full support in the run-up to, and beyond, the next election which I anticipate is likely to produce another hung parliament."" In reply, Mr Clegg said: ""Thank you for the brilliant job you have done as a minister over the past four and a half years, first at the Department of Transport and more recently at the Home Office. ""In both posts you have proved yourself as one of the most effective ministers in Government: always determined to deliver a more liberal agenda for Britain."" Ms Featherstone has said she is ""very happy to be returning to the Home Office"". ""I have always had a very constructive relationship with Theresa May and I look forward to working with her again,"" she said."

2014-11-04,"The beheading by Islamic State of British aid worker Alan Henning may have led to thousands of lives being saved because it has deterred young Muslims from joining the jihad, a member of the government's top anti-radicalisation programme has claimed.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20141104160633/http://news.sky.com/story/1366257/henning-murder-turned-tide-on-is-recruitment,"By Mark White, Home Affairs Correspondent The beheading by Islamic State of British aid worker Alan Henning may have led to thousands of lives being saved because it has deterred young Muslims from joining the jihad, a member of the government's top anti-radicalisation programme has claimed. So brutal and callous was the murder of the Salford taxi driver that it has ""turned the tide"" of British people looking to join the fight in Syria and Iraq, Sky News has been told.   In an exclusive interview, Sulaimaan Samuel, who works as a National Safeguarding Mentor for Channel, a Home Office scheme to tackle people judged to be at risk of radicalisation, told Sky News that IS propaganda tactics had ""backfired"". It is the first time anyone who works as part of the project has given a detailed insight into IS tactics and the threat the group poses online. Mr Henning was murdered by IS in October Mr Samuel said the ""grotesque"" beheading of US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff in August and September led the Muslim community to start to seriously question IS. British aid worker David Haines was also beheaded later that month. But it was the murder of Mr Henning in October that was the ""turning point"", Mr Samuel said. ""I would personally say to Alan Henning's family: do not think his death has been some type of waste because it hasn't, because his death at the hands of IS is the very thing that has caused the Muslim community to realise that what IS stands for is wrong and can never be condoned. ""In Alan's death he has managed to save thousands of lives now and in the future of people who might potentially have been drawn into going out. He will be saving lives in the future. ""What IS has done has backfired."" Security Minister James Brokenshire said he believed the relative effectiveness of the terror group's own brutal propaganda machine had opened people's eyes to the true nature of IS. He said: ""I think some of the shocking videos that we have seen, of brutalising murder, has underlined simply what IS is about and why it has prompted British Muslims to go online, post their own videos to underline their absolute abhorrence to this appalling violence and brutality.""               A senior Government security source has also highlighted a ""discernible change in attitude"" from mainstream Muslim society. Gallery: Profile: Alan Henning Alan Henning, 47, was born in Salford, Greater Manchester. Friends gave him the nickname ""gadget"" due to his love of technology The source said: ""What IS has done is demonstrate very clearly to everyone that this is no longer an unambiguous struggle to topple Assad, involving freedom fighters and people whose motive is simply to help Syrian people, and that terrorist groups have made the environment much more complicated and in turn have made it less clear cut for people as to whether they should travel or not."" Mr Samuel - who counsels those thought to be at risk of radicalisation - said the majority of his work is now dealing with young people being attracted to travelling to Syria and Iraq via the internet. He said: ""The days where the baddie, the super villain was in a cave, in a dark lair somewhere sat in a corner, stroking a cat - those days are finished. ""With the advent of technology, the internet, people can promote any idea they have. You don't need to be Michael Moore or a Spike Lee to reach a wide audience. ""Initially it may be a curiosity to see something shocking, but very quickly you can find yourself with a string of related videos which might lead you down a path which half an hour ago wasn't your destination."" Since Channel was set up in 2006, concerns have been raised about a total of 3,934 people - including 1,450 children. Of these, 777 people have been formally assessed as being vulnerable to radicalisation and referred to the project for formal help."

More than 300 members of the country's armed forces have been based at Cambridgeshire's Bassingbourn Barracks as part of the UK's pledge to support the Libyan government. Some had been due to return at the end of November but their stay is being cut short after five soldiers were accused of sex attacks. Two have admitted sexually assaulting women in Cambridge, while the latest charges relate to the rape of a man in the city on Sunday. Libyan soldiers in Italy, which also agreed to help train 15,000 recruits The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said: ""The majority of recruits have responded positively to the training despite the ongoing political uncertainty in Libya but there have been disciplinary issues. ""Training was initially expected to last until the end of November but we have agreed with the Libyan government that it is best for all involved to bring forward the training completion date. ""The recruits will be returning to Libya in the coming days. ""The UK remains committed to supporting the Libyan government as it works to establish stability and security across the country."" Sky News understands a small number of the soldiers, no more than three, left the base unannounced and are claiming asylum to remain in the UK. The MoD said it would review whether further Libyan recruits would be trained in the UK.  Libyan cadets Ibrahim Naji El Maarfi, 20, and Mohammed Abdalsalam, 27, appeared at Cambridge Magistrates' Court last week and admitted two counts of sexual assaulting women in the city. They are awaiting sentencing. Khaled El Azibi, 18, has been charged with three counts of sexual assault linked to the same incident but has yet to enter a plea. Moktar Ali Saad Mahmoud, 33, and Ibrahim Abogutila, 22, have been remanded in custody after appearing in court charged with raping a man in Cambridge. The decision to send the Libyan cadets home came after South Cambridgeshire MP and former health secretary Andrew Lansley wrote to the MoD to raise concerns."

He has been ordered to serve a minimum of eight-and-a-half years in prison after he pleaded guilty at Guildford Crown Court to attempted murder and grievous bodily harm. Coffey broke into the home of the 19-year-old woman in Hook Road on 18 April and attacked her with a knife before her 23-year-old brother came to her assistance, police say. Both victims suffered serious stab wounds. Surrey Police said in a statement: ""Coffey, who was known to the victims through previous contact via online gaming, was restrained by the family and arrested by officers who attended minutes later."" Temporary Detective Chief Inspector Antony Archibald said: ""This case was extremely complex and involved a set of unusual circumstances which could never have been foreseen by the victims. ""Coffey had previously been in contact with the two victims through online gaming. ""He persisted in harassing them even after they tried to break off communication and in April travelled to their address from America without their knowledge or invitation. ""This was an extremely frightening incident for the family, carried out by a troubled man who carefully planned the attack with disturbing precision. ""We have no doubt that Coffey intended to kill that night and he may have done had it not been for the brave and courageous actions of the family members who stopped him and quickly contacted police. ""While this kind of incident could not have been anticipated and is extremely rare, it is a clear reminder of the dangers that the internet may pose. ""We would always urge caution when engaging with people you do not know online, and would strongly advise that you do not give out any personal details whatsoever."""

The video - the seventh featuring the journalist - sees Mr Cantlie describe an apparent raid by the US military on July 4. ""In this programme I'll tell you about a failed raid to rescue us and how it feels to be left for dead by your own government,"" the 43-year-old tells the camera. Mr Cantlie, again dressed in an orange jumpsuit, claims F18 jets, Predator drones and 24 Delta Force commandos were involved in the operation. He says it must have cost ""tens of millions"" of dollars - and that all militants had to do to escape was spend a few dollars on petrol and drive to a different location. Sky's Enda Brady said: ""In parts of the video he is very angry, he is scathing of how Britain and the United States have not negotiated with the Islamic State for the release of him and other hostages. ""We don't know where it was filmed, we don't know when it was filmed. ""We've no way of independently verifying this footage but it is professionally filmed and very well edited. ""He is obviously speaking under great duress."" The video is again titled Lend Me Your Ears and lasts almost nine minutes. Mr Cantlie talks about having access to TV news channels such as Sky News and Al Jazeera and mentions recent speeches by Prime Minister David Cameron and US President Barack Obama. Last month IS released footage purporting to show Mr Cantlie in the embattled Syrian city of Kobani. Speaking about the new clip, a Foreign Office spokesman said: ""We are aware of a further video and are analysing its contents."" Mr Cantlie's father, Paul, died from complications following pneumonia last month - shortly after making an emotional appeal for his son's release.  The family has previously appealed for ""direct contact"" with the militants holding him. The video is the first to emerge since footage was released confirming the beheading of a fifth Western hostage, US aid worker Peter Kassig. His murder followed that of US journalists Steven Sotloff and James Foley and British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning."

Last night's explosion at the Hyatt Regency Churchill hotel on Portman Square in the Marylebone area caused part of the building to collapse. Five hundred people were evacuated from the hotel and all guests and staff were accounted for. Around 80 firefighters were on the scene, including appliances with specialist equipment to deal with collapsed buildings. London Ambulance Service initially said 12 people were injured but later revised the figure to 14, including two men with leg wounds who were taken to hospital. A further three people needed hospital treatment, while nine others were checked over at the scene and given the all-clear. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ""At about 11.40pm we were called to a suspected gas explosion at Portman Square. ""Officers are in attendance alongside the fire brigade and ambulance service. ""A small number of injured parties are being treated."" A spokesman for London Fire Brigade said the explosion is thought to have been caused by a gas leak. Structural engineers have been called to assess the damage in the basement area."
2014-11-22,Nigel Farage has said there could be more defections to his party over the coming days following UKIP's success in the Rochester and Strood by-election.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20141122164423/http://news.sky.com/story/1378115/farage-more-mps-plotting-defection-to-ukip,"By Emma Birchley, East of England Correspondent Nigel Farage has said there could be more defections to his party over the coming days following UKIP's success in the Rochester and Strood by-election. Mr Farage said he had been in talks with both Conservative and Labour MPs, and disgruntled backbenchers would now be crunching the numbers to work out if they should jump ship. David Cameron has vowed to win back the Kent seat for the Conservatives after Tory defector Mark Reckless regained the constituency with a majority of 2,920. Conservative marginal Stockton South looks set to be 'a close run' Meanwhile the party's first directly eleted MP, Douglas Carswell, is predicting UKIP could win dozens more seats in the May election - replacing Labour as the main opposition. One constituency in their sights is Stockton South, where a new poll shows both Labour and the Liberal Democrats losing ground to UKIP. Stockton South in the north east of England is seventh on Labour's target list for the election after the Conservatives won the seat by just 332 votes in 2010. But the survey by Survation has put the Tories on an unchanged 39% while Labour has dropped slightly to 37%... just as UKIP support has soared. UKIP candidate Ted Strike is not surprised. ""I think it's going to be a very close run thing between UKIP, Labour and the Tories,"" he said. ""UKIP shouldn't be in the frame at all and Labour should be miles ahead but it's not working out because of Ed Miliband in particular and also the fact that they have brought in a candidate from Liverpool."" The poll suggests that UKIP support has increased from 3% to 18% while the Lib Dems backing has collapsed to 3%... down 15 points. There is little chance that UKIP will win but the fact is, the party does not need a victory to upset the political balance. And Labour must win key marginals like Stockton South if it is to have any hope of succeeding in May's election. The Northern Echo's Political editor Chris Lloyd has watched the shift in the political landscape. He believes the Lib Dem vote has gone to Labour while UKIP has, at the same time, ""creamed"" votes from Mr Miliband's party. ""The Tories are staying where they are because they have got a great local figure and Labour are just not managing to enthuse many people and those unenthused people are jumping over to UKIP."" The ""great local figure"" is James Wharton MP who was behind the private member's bill that, if successful, would have guaranteed a referendum on EU membership. At Rototherm HNL Engineering in the heart of the constituency, workers understand why some voters are turning to UKIP. Machine shop manager Phil McGhee, at the factory in Thornaby, said: ""They have come along at just the right time to upset the applecart. ""Nobody has got any trust in the Labour Party or the Conservatives or the Lib Dems at the moment, and I think they are just grasping at something that might just change it."" Engineering machinist Steve Simpson also believes people are looking for something different and for many, UKIP fits the bill. ""Particularly the health service is in great need of looking at,"" he said. ""I think they have made one or two suggestions of an alternative way of looking at things and I think that might be appealing to people."" The theory had been that UKIP would split voters on the right giving Labour a leg up along the way. But it does not seem to be panning out as simply as that. As the UKIP leader said after the party's second MP was voted in... all bets are off."
2014-11-22,A man who raped an 11-year-old boy in the toilets of a shopping centre in Manchester has been jailed for life.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20141122164423/http://news.sky.com/story/1378132/paedophile-jailed-for-life-over-toilet-rape,"A man who raped an 11-year-old boy in the toilets of a shopping centre in Manchester has been jailed for life. John Ferrier, 69, of Ormskirk Road, Wigan, was found guilty of rape at Manchester Crown Court after already admitting possessing what police called a bladed article. Police said he approached the boy in the toilets at the Arndale shopping centre on 18 October last year, asking him to enter the cubicle with him. Ferrier attacked the boy at Manchester's Arndale centre last year When the boy refused Ferrier dragged him inside and assaulted him. The victim then fled and told a member of the public before speaking to a security guard, who detained Ferrier until police arrived. The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, ran away after seeing Ferrier, but was traced three days later when he told police officers visiting his school about the incident. Ferrier was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of eight years. Detective Constable Simon France, from the Serious Sexual Offences Unit, said: ""I would like to commend the victim, who with the support of his family and specially trained officers, had the courage to come forward and tell police what happened to him. ""He is a young boy who has had a terrifying ordeal and it was not easy for him to admit what had happened. ""With his support we have been able to bring Ferrier before the courts and he will now spend a substantial period of time in prison. ""I would also like to thank members of the public and the staff at Manchester Arndale as it was due to their quick actions that meant a dangerous man was stopped and arrested at the scene."""
