2014-08-19,Rail Passenger Fares To Rise By 3.5% In 2015,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140819110755/http://news.sky.com/story/1321154/rail-passenger-fares-to-rise-by-3-5-percent-in-2015,"Rail passengers face a hike of 3.5% in train fares in the new year amid anger over the high-cost of train travel. 
	Campaigners have been protesting at 45 train stations across the country over ticket price increases far outstripping wages rises. 
	The fare rise is determined by adding 1% to the just-published Retail Prices Index inflation figure for July, which is 2.5%. 
	But train companies have a ""flex"" option to add another 2% to some fares, as long as the overall average stays at RPI plus 1%. 
	It means some fares could go up by 5.5%. 
	Campaigners say the hike will mean fares have leapt by almost a quarter since the coalition came to power, while over the same period wages have risen by 6.9%. 
	It has already led to calls for the Government to again cap the increase to RPI plus 0% as it did last year. 
	Kevin Rowan of the TUC said it was bad news for passengers, and claimed the fare hikes were going towards the profits and shareholder dividends of the private train operators. 
	Labour has also condemned the rise, with Shadow Transport Secretary Mary Creagh saying: ""David Cameron has allowed train companies to sting passengers with inflation-busting fare rises of over 20% since 2010, costing them hundreds of pounds. We can't go on like this."" 
	But Transport Minister Claire Perry defended the rises arguing there had been an ""unprecedented investment"" in the rail service. 
	She told Sky News: ""The challenge is making sure fares are fair."" 
	David Sidebottom, director of rail customer watchdog Passenger Focus, said many travellers would be concerned about the fare rise. 
	He said: ""This level of fare increase puts more pressure on the railways to ensure passengers get an excellent service for the money they are paying."" 
	""We hope the Government will step in again as it did last year, to ensure that train fares in England do not rise above the rate of inflation announced today."" 
	The transport charity Sustrans said: ""Last year the Chancellor showed he understood the negative impact of high rail costs on the economy by holding fares to an inflation-only increase. He needs to take action again this year."""
2014-08-19,Coach Overturns On Motorway And Lands In Ditch,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140819110755/http://news.sky.com/story/1321207/coach-overturns-on-motorway-and-lands-in-ditch,"Dozens of children on a coach trip to the seaside have escaped injury after their vehicle crashed and overturned on a motorway, ending up in a ditch. 
	Of the 53 passengers on board, six including one child and five adults, were slightly hurt in the accident on the M5 in Gloucestershire. 
	They were described as ""walking wounded"" while the driver suffered a back injury. 
	The child was taken to Bristol Children's Hospital while the adults were transported to Southmead Hospital. 
	The group was on their way to the Somerset resort of Weston-super-Mare when the crash happened on the southbound side of the motorway between junctions 13 and 14, near Dursley. 
	They had been picked up from a children's centre in West Bromwich, West Midlands, and were due to spend the day at the seaside. 
	Police said the vehicle which left the carriageway before crashing was from Stourbridge-based Prospect Coaches. 
	A spokesman for the Gloucestershire force said: ""Police were called shortly before 10am after a southbound coach left the M5, overturned and landed in a ditch at J13. 
	""Fifty-four people, believed to be of various ages, were on board, including the driver. 
	""Transport is being laid on to convey the passengers from the scene."""
2014-08-19,Sir Cliff Richard Hires High-Profile Lawyer,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140819110755/http://news.sky.com/story/1320879/sir-cliff-richard-hires-high-profile-lawyer,"By Martin Brunt, Crime Correspondent, Portugal Sir Cliff Richard has hired the celebrities' go-to criminal lawyer to defend him against a sex assault allegation. 
	London solicitor Ian Burton flew into Portugal with a colleague and spent five hours in a meeting at the pop star's wine estate overlooking the Algarve coast. 
	Sir Cliff, 73, was spotted saying goodbye to them at the door of his villa before an aide drove them back to Faro airport to catch their return flight. 
	The pop star has rarely been seen since returning to his home near Albufeira on Friday, the day after police raided his Berkshire apartment as part of a sex assault investigation. 
	A man has accused Sir Cliff of sexually attacking him during an evangelical rally in Sheffield in 1985. 
	The multi-millionaire singer emerged in the grounds of his Portuguese home on Saturday when six friends arrived by car to play tennis. 
	Sir Cliff played a singles game on Sunday, but did not play on Monday as he spent time with the lawyers. 
	Mr Burton, the senior partner in the firm he founded Burton Copeland, is considered one of the Britain's most successful and experienced lawyers. 
	He has represented football manager Harry Redknapp, who was cleared of tax evasion, PR agent Max Clifford, who was jailed for sex offences, and former Harrods owner Mohamed Al-Fayed. 
	His company has also represented TV cook Nigella Lawson, jockey Kieren Fallon, who was acquitted of race-fixing, and the late singer Amy Winehouse. 
	The online law guide Legal 500 described Mr Burton as ""tough and canny"" and wrote in an assessment of his ability: ""If there is a chance of nipping an investigation in the bud, he will do it."" 
	Mr Burton, 67, said in an interview four years ago: ""Anybody can go out and learn the law. Anyone can read a book. Anyone can interpret the law, understand the law. 
	""But you can't suddenly bolt on the experience of actually having dealt with the thing, actually implementing it when there is a dawn raid."" 
	Sir Cliff denies the sex assault accusation and has criticised South Yorkshire Police for not warning him about the UK raid, but inviting a BBC news crew to film it. 
	Detectives have spoken to Sir Cliff's lawyers and they are expected to question him in the next few weeks after examining items removed during the raid. 
	Police were also interviewing a number of people who have contacted them with information in the past few day."
2014-08-19,Inflation Drops More Than Expected In July,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140819110755/http://news.sky.com/story/1321148/inflation-drops-more-than-expected-in-july,"The two measures of UK inflation have dropped more than expected in July, prompted by discounting on the high street. 
	According to official data, the Retail Prices Index (RPI) stood at 2.5% and the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) was 1.6%. 
	Economists had expected a CPI rate of around 1.8%, after official figures showed a June rate of 1.9%. 
	CPI now appears to be headed back towards May's figure of 1.5%, which at the time was the lowest level for four-and-a-half years. 
	Inflation has been below the Bank of England (BoE) 2% target for seven straight months - the first time this has occurred since 2005. 
	The RPI, which unlike the other measure includes housing costs, was recorded in June at 2.6%. 
	The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the biggest contributor to the slowing annual inflation rate was discounting on the high street for clothing and footwear. 
	This was because retailers held off on price cuts throughout June. 
	Food and non-alcoholic drinks also fell year-on-year, and the CPI was also eased by falling spirits and wine prices. 
	Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander told Sky News: ""The fact that inflation has been below the Bank of England target for seven consecutive months shows that subdued inflation is now becoming the norm as the economy recovers. 
	""Eliminating the deficit fairly, and repairing the UK economy remains central to the role of Liberal Democrats in Government. 
	""These encouraging inflation numbers should give businesses the confidence they need to deliver the investment required to boost productivity. Rising productivity is the only route to sustainable increases in living standards."" 
	The data comes as commuters learned they would face a 3.5% increase in rail fares next year, which uses the RPI figure plus 1% to calculate increases. 
	The further drop to the CPI eases pressure on the BoE to hike the 0.5% base rate, which has been at its historic low for the last five years. 
	Meanwhile, the ONS said UK house prices increased by 10.2% in the year to June, reaching a new high average price of £265,000. 
	House prices in the capital, however, shot up by 19.3% in the year to June. 
	It calculated the average house price in London at £499,000, and said that ""house prices are increasing strongly across most parts of the UK""."
2014-08-19,Hundreds Of Police Breach Rules On Social Media,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140819110755/http://news.sky.com/story/1320978/hundreds-of-police-breach-rules-on-social-media,"By Frazer Maude, Sky News Reporter Hundreds of police employees have been investigated for breaching social media guidelines at forces across England and Wales. 
	The figures, obtained through a Freedom of Information (FOI) request, show a total of 828 cases were reported to police, ranging from social media gaffes to sackable offences involving harassment, and posts of a sexual, racist or homophobic nature. 
	A total of 14% of the investigations resulted in no further action being taken or the individual having no case to answer, but 9% ended in a resignation, dismissal or retirement. 
	The police regularly use Twitter, Flickr, Facebook and other social media platforms to connect with the public and to help with crime prevention and detection. 
	Greater Manchester Police recently posted the 7,000th image on its Flickr account. 
Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) guidelines state officers and police staff should avoid using the internet while off-duty or after having drunk alcohol, due to the potential for their judgement to be impaired. 
	They also warn of the propensity for criminals to trawl the internet and identify personal information about police employees ""with a view to embarrassing, discrediting, harassing, corrupting or blackmailing them or their families for their own benefit"". 
	Deputy Chief Constable Ian Hopkins, of Greater Manchester Police, is the ACPO lead on social media. 
	""Social media is a key tool for us in having conversations with communities, using it not only to pass information but to receive information about crime and incidents, help people make informed choices,"" he said. 
	""All police employees are covered by the code of ethics that was introduced earlier this year. 
	""So staff must act with integrity, with fairness, with honesty, openness, and regardless of whether they are tweeting as John Smith or Joanna Smith, if they are recognisable as a PC or a member of police staff, then they have to be taking into account the code of ethics."" 
	According to the Press Association, who submitted the FOI request, the investigations included: 
:: A PCSO with Devon and Cornwall Police who received a final written warning for posting photos on Facebook of themselves with weapons. 
:: A civilian member of police staff who posted a comment on Facebook regarding the actions of Muslims in central London failing to observe a two-minute silence. It was alleged the language used ""could be regarded as offensive/inappropriate or likely to cause offence to other persons"", police said. 
:: A Gwent PC who acted inappropriately while attending a member of the public's home address and asked her to become a friend on Facebook, later sending a message through the site. They received a written warning. 
:: Two special constables in Northampton who resigned after they were pictured on Facebook in a ""compromising position"". 
:: A civilian with South Yorkshire Police who was accused of harassing an ex-partner via Facebook. They resigned prior to misconduct proceedings. 
	Chief Constable Alex Marshall, chief executive of the College of Policing, said: ""People working in policing must always be mindful of the high standards that the public expect from us. 
	""Our code of ethics, which was launched last month, sets out the standards which everyone in the service should strive to uphold whether at work or away from work, online or offline."" 
	Additional details provided by most forces under FOI laws showed 548 of those investigated were police officers, compared with 175 civilian staff and 31 PCSOs."
2014-08-19,Tim Vine Gag Named Edinburgh's Funniest,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140819110755/http://news.sky.com/story/1321164/tim-vine-gag-named-edinburghs-funniest,"Tim Vine has said he is surprised after becoming the first comic to win the funniest gag award twice at the Edinburgh Fringe. 
	Vine, 47, saw his joke earn almost a fifth of the votes in the competition run by comedy television channel Dave. 
	He won with the one-liner: ""I decided to sell my Hoover ... well it was just collecting dust."" 
	It is the first time the award has been presented to a previous winner. Vine triumphed in 2010 with the joke: ""I've just been on a once-in-a-lifetime holiday. I'll tell you what, never again."" 
	He was also runner up in 2011, 2012 and 2013. 
	On being crowned this year's winner, Vine said: ""I'm a little bit surprised but very delighted. This is the second time I've won this award but I guess nobody loves a repeat more than Dave."" 
	Vine told Sky News he has a very strict process for crafting his jokes: ""For every 10 jokes I write, I do 10 of them!"" 
	Steve North, general manager of Dave, said: ""It's great to see a range of established and new comedians in this year's top 10. 
	""The award celebrates the fantastic range of comedy on offer at the Fringe, and Tim has once again proved he is king of the one-liners."" 
	To find the favourite joke, 10 judges scoured the festival's venues for a week before nominating their three favourite jokes. 
	They were then put to the public voted, with 2,000 people choosing the 10 they found funniest. 
:: The 10 funniest jokes from the Fringe Festival 2014: 
1. ""I've decided to sell my Hoover ... well, it was just collecting dust"" - Tim Vine. 
2. ""I've written a joke about a fat badger, but I couldn't fit it into my set"" - Masai Graham. 
3. ""Always leave them wanting more, my uncle used to say to me. Which is why he lost his job in disaster relief"" - Mark Watson.

2014-08-19,Government 'Bailed Out' Over School Dinners,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140819110755/http://news.sky.com/story/1321005/government-bailed-out-over-school-dinners,"Cash-strapped schools and councils are having to ""bail out the Government because of its own incompetence"", the shadow education secretary has claimed. 
	A survey by the Local Government Association (LGA) found many authorities do not have enough cash to provide Nick Clegg's pledge to give free school meals to all infants. 
	Government funding worth £150m was handed to councils as part of the scheme announced by the Deputy Prime Minister - this was to cover improvements to kitchens and dining facilities. 
	But the LGA survey of 75 councils found nearly half (47%) said they had not received enough cash to cover the full cost of the work. 
	Tristram Hunt said: ""Nick Clegg announced the policy without doing the maths first. It's more evidence that voters cannot trust a word the Liberal Democrats say."" 
	Of those that said they did not have enough money, 49% said the council would make up the difference, with 37% saying some of the cash would come from school coffers. 
	The LGA found that money earmarked for school maintenance and repairs could also be used to make up the difference. 
	The total shortfall in funding has been estimated at £25.9m. 
	Councillor David Simmonds, chairman of the LGA's children and young people board, said: ""There's no doubt that dishing up a nutritious lunch for every young pupil will improve the experience of school and help them concentrate in lessons. 
	""Councils and schools have been working really hard to make this happen within this ambitious timescale. 
	""But it cannot be right that for some councils, money set aside for maintenance has instead had to be spent plugging the shortfall in money which government should have provided for meals."""
2014-08-19,Sabrina Moss: Three Guilty Of Teacher Murder,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140819110755/http://news.sky.com/story/1320773/sabrina-moss-three-guilty-of-teacher-murder,"Three men have been found guilty of murdering a nursery teacher as she celebrated her 24th birthday. 
	Sabrina Moss was gunned down near a fast food restaurant in Kilburn, north London, in an attack by two hooded men armed with a machine gun and a shotgun. 
	The mother-of-one was shot in the heart and died in hospital from her injuries. 
	She and friend Sabrina Gachette were both caught in the crossfire of a ""deep-seated"" bloody drugs turf war as they sheltered from the rain with a group of 15 others under a shop awning by the Woody Grill, in the early hours of August 24, last year. 
	Jurors at the Old Bailey heard they were not the intended targets and were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
	Miss Gachette, who was hit in the back by more than 50 gunshot pellets, survived to give evidence during the 10-week trial. 
	The 25-year-old, who almost a year on, still has a few pellets lodged in her body, said: ""There was no warning. I thought someone had thrown a brick at me. Then because of the explosion I thought it was a firework. 
	""Sabrina was in front of me and that was when I heard her say she had been shot in her heart. That is the last thing I remember hearing her say."" 
	Jurors found drug dealers Hassan Hussain, 29, of Willesden; Yasin James, 20, of Wembley and Martell Warren, 23, of Kensall Green, all London, guilty of Miss Moss's murder and the attempted murder of Miss Gachette. 
	Their intended targets were members of the South Kilburn Gang - and Miss Moss, who was dressed in a bright red dress and high heels - would have stood out from the crowd like a beacon in the night, jurors were told. 
	Nevertheless, Hussain discharged the Mac 10 ""spray and pray"" machine gun six times and James fired both barrels of the shotgun at near point blank range before fleeing the scene in a car driven by Warren. 
	Jurors heard Warren was a convicted drug dealer and a member of the Kensal Green Boys or Bloods, known as the KGB, while Hussain had a previous conviction for grievous bodily harm and was jailed for five years for stabbing his ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend six times. 
	The trio were also found guilty of the attempted murder of Mahad Ahmed and Edson Da'Silva, possession of a Mac 10 machine gun with intent to endanger life, and possession of a shotgun with intent to endanger life. 
	In addition, along with a fourth defendant - Simon Baptiste, 29, from Cricklewood, north London - they were found guilty of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm between August 22 and August 25 last year. 
	Miss Gachette, who had known Miss Moss for 13 years, said afterwards:  ""She was just fun-loving. She was always up for a good time. She had time for everyone. There was not a bad bone in her body at all."" 
	She added: ""Justice has not only been served for us as victims, it has been done for the community - there are violent people off the streets."" 
	Hussain, James and Warren will be sentenced on September 12."
2014-08-19,Gender Pay Gap Continues To Widen For Women,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140819110755/http://news.sky.com/story/1320770/gender-pay-gap-continues-to-widen-for-women,"Women in management position still earn significantly less than their male counterparts, according to a new report. 
	The Chartered Management Institute (CMI) said the pay gap is widening and for women in their 40s earnings are more than a third less than men. 
	The CMI survey of 68,000 managers across the UK showed there was a £9,000 pay differential, equivalent to 23%, which increased as women got older. 
	It added that annual bonuses for female directors were also lower, by £11,000, at slightly below £42,000. 
	As a result of the disparity, a woman must work 14 years longer over a lifetime to earn the same amount of money, the report said. 
	CMI chief executive Ann Francke said: ""Lower levels of pay for women managers cannot be justified, yet our extensive data shows the pay gap persists, with many women hit by a mid-life pay crisis. 
	""Women and men should be paid on the basis of their performance in their particular roles, but this is clearly not yet the case for far too many. 
	""It's not right that women would have to work until almost 80 for the same pay rewards as men. 
	The CMI said it is not acceptable to use raising children or ""time served"" as excuses for the gap. 
	XpertHR head of salary surveys Mark Crail, who helped with the study, said: ""The data shows that women begin to fall behind at the age when they are most likely to be starting a family, and it just gets worse from then on. 
	""It appears that employers often give up on women in mid-career and are missing out on a huge pool of untapped knowledge, experience and talent."""

	The company said underlying profit reached £212.9m in the six months to the end of June. 
	Revenue in the period was also up 33% to £1.2bn and it said sale completions in the six months were up 28%. 
	It sold 6,408 new homes with an average selling price up 4.3% at £186,970. 
	The results cover the months when there was a flurry of increased activity in the housing market. 
	It bought 14,251 building plots in the period, pushing its portfolio of consented land sites to 82,250. 
	Sharp price rises were only slowed late in the period, when the fear of rate rises and new mortgage affordability rules were brought in. 
	Group chief executive Jeff Fairburn told Sky News: ""We see good confidence in the market so we are seeing good visitor levels. 
	""Certainly the mortgage market is very supportive at the moment and Help to Buy, as a message, is certainly bringing confidence to buyers - particularly first-time buyers - and enabling them to buy new homes. 
	""So we're pleased to see the additional demand and we're keen to step up our production to meet that."" 
	The company said it has now built a cash stockpile of £326m, up from £48m in the same period last year. 
	The results come a day after Bovis Homes said its pre-tax profit for the first six months of the year was up 166%, to £49.4m, on the back of a record number of completions."
2014-08-19,Hesitant Cameron Increasingly Involved In Iraq,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140819110755/http://news.sky.com/story/1320200/hesitant-cameron-increasingly-involved-in-iraq,"By Darren McCaffrey, Sky News Reporter ""Bombs and missiles are bad ambassadors. They win no hearts and minds; they can build no democracies. There are more tools of statecraft than military power."" 
	David Cameron, as leader of the opposition in 2006, flash forward to today and the Prime Minister’s language seems more strident, the warnings more stark. 
	""If we do not act to stem the onslaught of this exceptionally dangerous terrorist movement, it will only grow stronger until it can target us on the streets of Britain. 
	""We are in the middle of a generational struggle against a poisonous and extremist ideology."" 
	This as the Bishop of Leeds has accused the government of not having  a ""coherent or comprehensive approach to Islamist extremism as it is developing across the globe"". 
	But is this a fair assessment? 
	It is certainly true, like President Obama, scarred by interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan, the plan was to withdraw British troops from conflicts and not get involved in more. 
	After all, defence spending has been cut and the army is on course to be smaller than at any time since the First World War. 
	All this changed with Benghazi, Libya in 2011 when Britain with France lead airstrikes to stop a massacre and ultimately bring down Colonel Gaddafi. 
	Two years later and it was Syria; the Prime Minister thought Assad had to go and that meant helping the rebels, a deliberate interventionist strategy, which won round President Obama, only to fall apart in Parliament when it was opposed by Ed Miliband. 
	Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria - different conflicts with different ends but all interventions the Prime Minister has supported or called for. 
	So why not Iraq this time, given the humanitarian need and the 'poisonous' threat of the Islamic State? 
	Well, firstly we are involved, not with airstrikes but, increasingly, British military capability is helping to deliver aid or helping with surveillance. 
	Undoubtedly scarred by the Syria vote last year, and concerns about public opinion, the Prime Minister is more hesitant about joining the Americans in dropping bombs. 
	But with public opinion so far accepting of intervention, Britain has inch-by-inch, day-by-day been getting more militarily involved. 
	Given the threat by Islamic State, that is only likely to continue."

	They connect with the fuel lines and top up their tanks at 300mph. 
	Two jets have latched onto the lines trailing behind a much bigger Voyager plane that we are travelling on. 
	It is the middle of the night and we are watching the sharp end of the UK's humanitarian efforts for displaced people in the Sinjar mountains in northern Iraq. 
	Without this support plane, the Tornados would not be able to cover the ground that they need to. 
	We can't be told exactly what and how the Tornado crews are scanning below them but their information is being shared among those nations who have decided to pitch in and help in this crisis. 
	The stories of torture and suffering have made this a mission where the British forces know they can make an immediate and significant contribution. 
	The UK focus is, for now, on humanitarian aid while the Americans have sanctioned their own air strikes on the Islamic State militants who have been terrorising minority communities in northern Iraq. 
	The RAF crews are working day-to-day on their mission, unsure whether it will ramp up or wind down in the next 24 hours. 
	Prepare For Tomorrow is part of the motto at their base at Akrotiri where we land on the southern tip of Cyprus. 
	The teams are still doing that but, with this particular mission, nobody quite knows what tomorrow will bring."
2014-08-19,Polls Do Not Mean War In Iraq Will Be Popular,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140819110755/http://news.sky.com/story/1317498/polls-do-not-mean-war-in-iraq-will-be-popular,"Opinion in Westminster is shifting towards military intervention in Iraq. 
	Of the MPs I have spoken to, 15 have said they would support it compared to just three who would be against. 
	This poses a dilemma for the Prime Minister. 
	After the bloody, protracted conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq – wars with no clear aim or end point – the British and American public are scarred by the solemn lines of coffins containing servicemen and women coming home to be buried. 
	Rather than being proud to be the policemen of the world, there is a new scepticism about whether the West can make a difference (except for the worst.) 
	Make no mistake – if David Cameron can find a way to avoid British combat troops going into Iraq, he will. 
	MPs on both sides of the House are appalled by the thousands of people trapped on the bleak mountains in Iraq or – worse – butchered and buried in make shift graves. 
	Conservative MPs in particular are demanding the Prime Minister recall Parliament to debate whether the UK should be involved in air strikes against IS or arming Kurdish forces. 
	But the line from Downing Street has been consistent: Britain’s focus is on humanitarian assistance rather than a combat role so the Prime Minister will not recall MPs. 
	Mr Cameron is still bruised by losing the vote on intervention in Syria – he does not want to risk another humiliation. 
	But there is another reason why British forces are unlikely to march into battle to save the Yazidis: next year is an election year. 
	Remember when Barack Obama refused to lead the air strikes in Libya, preferring to quietly support the British and French forces? 
	That was back in 2011. One year later, in 2012, the American public voted on who should be their next President. 
	Counterintuitively, a poll in the Times today shows support for British bombing of militants in Iraq is at 40% - that's up 3% compared to the same poll taken on Monday. It also shows 36% of those asked were opposed to action. 
	But that does not tell the whole story. 
	When George Bush declared a ""war on terrorism"" on September 21st 2001, his approval ratings jumped to an astonishing high of 90%. 
	In 2003, shortly before the invasion of Iraq, an Ipsos Mori poll showed that 56% of the British public supported Britain's involvement compared to 38% who opposed it. 
	That support – it hardly needs to be said – crumbled away to leave a mistrust in politicians that still resides to this day. 
	No wonder Mr Cameron is reluctant to embark on military action."

	Three ambulances and a rapid response car were called to Woodland Holiday Park, Trimingham, after the resort's swimming pool was evacuated. 
	Paramedics found a number of people who were coughing and complaining of sore throats and stomach aches. 
	Lee Fox, from the East of England Ambulance Service, said: ""We assessed everyone to find out the severity of their conditions and decided three children needed to be taken to the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital. 
	""A family of three were also treated and decided to make their own way to hospital."" 
	Woodland Holiday Park, near the seaside town of Cromer, is described on its website as a ""cosy retreat"" in a coastal setting. 
	Facilities at the park, which contains cabins, lodges and static caravans, include an indoor pool and sauna, a fishing lake and children's play area.

2014-08-19,Wimbledon Burglary: Hunt For Bow-Legged Pole,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140819110755/http://news.sky.com/story/1320760/wimbledon-burglary-hunt-for-bow-legged-pole,"Police are hunting a bow-legged Polish man suspected of being involved in a violent raid on a house in suburban London that left an academic with ""life changing"" injuries. 
	Oskar Pawlowichz, 29, is thought to have been one of a gang of four who forced their way into the home in Wimbledon and smashed Paul Kohler repeatedly around the face. 
	Mr Kohler, a father of four and law lecturer at the School of Oriental and African Studies, was left needing facial reconstructive surgery and struggling to see after his eye socket was badly damaged. 
	His wife Samatha was tied up with tape by the raiders who demanded the family hand over cash. 
	The couple endured an eight-minute ordeal and only escaped because Mr Kohler's daughter was able to flee with her boyfriend to her bedroom where she locked the door and called police. 
	Two of the men were arrested at the scene during the attack shortly after 10pm on August 11. 
	Another was detained on Monday morning in nearby Garrett Lane, in Wandsworth, on suspicion of aggravated burglary. 
	Detectives fear 29-year-old Pawlowichz may try to flee the country and have distributed his details to border posts. 
	They put out an appeal for help tracking down the Pole who they described as 6ft, stocky, bow-legged and walks with a limp. 
	Police said he was caught on CCTV fleeing from the scene and was filmed crossing The Broadway and passing through the car park of the New Wimbledon Theatre. 
	Detective Inspector Dan O'Sullivan said: ""We are calling for members of the public, in particular the Polish community, to assist us in tracing Pawlowichz's whereabouts. 
	""We believe that he may make an attempt to flee from the UK to Poland, and at present we are in direct liaison with the Polish authorities, UK Border Agency and Interpol and a co-ordinated effort to detain Pawlowichz is under way."" 
	Mr Kohler had surgery for a fractured eye socket and suffered multiple facial injuries and extensive bruising to his body and limbs. 
	He told the Evening Standard that he was only saved from having a wooden cabinet smashed on his head by a quick-acting police officer who arrived in the nick of time. 
	Mr Kohler, 55, who also has a share in a London cabaret club, said: ""He didn't think about himself, he just grabbed him and took him out. It was really brave. 
	""I was quite bad, lying in a pool of my own blood at this point and I'm sure had that happened, the fractured skull they thought I had would have happened.""

	The veteran broadcaster had been battling throat cancer and retired from the BBC last year after surgery to remove his larynx. 
	He was described by Richard Burgess, head of BBC Radio Sport, as a ""true gentleman"" who would be ""greatly missed"". 
	Gordon began reading the results in 1974, initially on Radio 2 and then Radio 5 Live, and his role in what became a national institution made him one of radio's most recognisable voices. 
	His distinctive delivery allowed fans tuning in for the results to guess whether their team had won, lost or drawn simply from his inflection. 
	Gordon, who contracted polio as a child and wore leg supports in his youth, started his working life in music publishing before joining the BBC as an announcer and newsreader in 1972. 
	He was replaced by Charlotte Green following his retirement. 
	Among those to pay tribute to Gordon were TV presenter and former England striker Gary Lineker, who wrote: ""A voice we all know, the voice of the football results, James Alexander Gordon has died. Tottenham Hotspur 1. Newcastle United 1. #RIP."" 
	Ex-Wales international Robbie Savage described Gordon as a ""fantastic man with a great voice"", while England goalkeeper Ben Foster added: ""RIP James Alexander Gordon. Saturday afternoons checking Teletext and listening to the footy scores was the best."""

	Tests on Meet Singh Kapoor, who is believed to be in his 40s and is understood to have died in his children's arms, proved inconclusive. 
	Essex Police have launched a ""homicide"" investigation after the death and detectives have said charges could include murder or manslaughter.

	A tribunal awarded Raytheon Systems Limited £49.98m in damages after it found the way in which the now-disbanded UK Border Agency had decided to scrap the agreement over the controversial e-borders programme was flawed. 
	The department must also pay Raytheon £9.6m for disputed contract change notices, £126m for assets acquired through the contract between 2007 and 2010 and £38m in interest. 
	E-borders, devised by the Labour government in 2003, was designed to count everyone in and out of the UK by collecting advance passenger information on all scheduled inbound and outbound journeys to and from the UK. 
	But the system had been dogged by problems, including delays and brief changes. 
	In a letter from the Home Secretary to the chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee Keith Vaz, Theresa May said: ""The Treasury will work with the Home Office to make sure these costs are met without any impact on frontline services. 
	""We are looking carefully at the tribunal's detailed conclusions to see if there are any grounds for challenging the award. 
	""The Government stands by the decision to end the e-borders contract with Raytheon. 
	""This decision was, and remains, the most appropriate action to address the well-documented issues with the delivery and management of the programme."" 
	The Home Secretary said key targets had been missed by Raytheon in 2010 and parts of the programme were running at least a year late. 
	""The situation the Government inherited was, therefore, a mess with no attractive options,"" she said. 
	""All other alternatives available to the Government would have led to greater costs than the result of this tribunal ruling."" 
	She said the National Audit Office had been asked to conduct a full review of e-borders from the start. 
	The Home Secretary also said the original e-borders requirement - to record advanced passenger information for checking against terrorist and crime watchlists - is being delivered. 
	In a statement to the New York Stock Exchange, Raytheon, said: ""The tribunal's ruling confirms that (Raytheon) delivered substantial capabilities to the UK Home Office under the e-borders programme. 
	""Raytheon remains committed to partnering with the UK Government on key defence, national security and commercial pursuits."" 
	David Hanson, Shadow Home Office Minister, said: ""This is a crushing verdict on a Home Office decision made by David Cameron's government, which has cost the taxpayer hundreds of millions of pounds over the last four years."""

	Scotland's Government insists it will keep the pound in a formal currency union with the remainder of the UK - despite it being ruled out by all UK parties. 
	The SNP is coming under sustained pressure to reveal what its ""Plan B"" on currency would be. 
	The Scottish Government's Fiscal Commission proposed a range of alternatives to using the pound - including a new independent currency, joining the euro and the informal use the pound using a process called ""sterlingisation"". 
	But Mr Salmond has told Sky News: ""The other Westminster parties can't stop Scotland using the pound, using sterling. 
	""What they could do is deny us access to the Bank of England, to the financial assets of the country. 
	""The reason they won't do that of course is that if they took all the assets they would end up with all the liabilities - that's all the ginormous debt that the likes of George Osborne and Alistair Darling built up and they aren't going to do that because that would be the equivalent of giving every Scot a present of a thousand pounds a year."" 
	But Shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander, launching the latest stage of the Better Together campaign in Glasgow, said people wanted answers from the First Minister on the currency. 
	He said: ""We know that the capital would be Edinburgh, we know that the flag would be the saltire but we don't know what the currency would be. 
	""Burying his head in the sand at this point is a bit like digging a hole that is deeper for him in the coming days."" 
	With a month to go before vote, a new poll has indicated support for an independent Scotland is growing. 
	Research by YouGov shows that 38% would vote Yes to independence - the highest level since the pollster started recording. 
	But the No campaign still has a clear majority, with 51% intending to vote to keep Scotland in the UK. 
	Those who say they are undecided has fallen to just 11%. 
	The poll came as the National Australia Bank (NAB) - the owner of Clydesdale and Yorkshire Banks - became the latest business to warn of the risks it faces from Scottish independence. 
	NAB said a Yes vote could bring ""significant additional costs"" and that it had made contingency plans should Scotland split from the UK."

	High above Westminster, a team of experts abseiled down from the 314ft tower to check the four dials of the iconic timepiece. 
	As well as cleaning the faces, they are also inspecting for any damage. 
	The work is expected to take about a week. 
	The clock was installed in the tower in April 1859, and at the time cost £2,500 to make. 
	At first, it did not work as the cast-iron minute hands were too heavy. 
	Once they were replaced by lighter copper hands, it successfully began keeping time on May 31, 1859. 
	The gongs of the Great Bell were heard for the first time on July 11 of that year. 
	The name Big Ben is often used to describe the tower, the clock and the bell but the name was first given to the Great Bell."

	The Australian spelled out his plans for his next moves alongside Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino at the embassy in Knightsbridge. 
	Widespread reports had suggested the WikiLeaks website founder needs hospital treatment for heart and lung problems. 
	But the 43-year-old denied he was leaving the embassy for health reasons. 
	He said: ""I am leaving the embassy soon - but perhaps not for the reasons the Murdoch press and Sky News are saying at the moment. 
	""Being detained in various ways in this country without charge for four years and in this embassy for two years which has no outside area, therefore no sunlight… it is an environment in which any healthy person would find themselves soon enough with certain difficulties."" 
	Mr Assange insisted Ecuador's decision to grant him political asylum ""is the correct one"". 
	He said: ""How can it be that such a situation in Europe arises where a person is held and their freedom of movement restricted and they are kept from their family while a foreign government builds an ever larger case against that person and their organisation? 
	""Somehow the situation has developed here for me… where basic rights that were previously universally accepted in Europe are no longer respected."" 
	He added that there had been ""significant mis-reporting"" surrounding his case. 
	He said: ""Firstly - I have not been charged with an offence here in the UK or in Sweden at any time. 
	""Secondly, the basis under which my asylum was granted here is the ongoing US investigation into me and WikiLeaks. 
	""It is often falsely reported that women in Sweden have accused me of the serious crime of rape. That is false. 
	""This is the situation which is being seized upon, at the time of the conflict between me and the US, the Swedish government resurrected a matter that had been previously dropped."" 
	Mr Patino said: ""There has been two years of great uncertainty and a lack of legal protection. This situation must come to an end. Two years is simply too long. 
	""It is time to free Julian Assange.” 
	He added that he would seek to meet with the British Foreign Secretary in the next few weeks to discuss resolving the situation. 
	Kristinn Hrafnsson, WikiLeaks spokesman, said: ""The plan, as always, is to leave as soon as the UK Government decides to honour its obligations in relation to international agreements."" 
	Mr Assange requested asylum in June 2012 and has been under continued surveillance with police stationed outside the embassy since. 
	He faces an arrest warrant in Sweden over allegations he sexually assaulted two women and would be arrested if he left the embassy building. 
	Mr Assange has been investigated by US authorities since WikiLeaks published leaked military and diplomatic documents in 2010 and has said he fears being extradited to the US to face questioning if he goes to Sweden."

	The Prime Minister used a speech to admit children and parents have often suffered as the result of legislation. 
	From October, Whitehall impact assessments for policies will have to formally consider their effects on families, alongside factors such as cost effectiveness and the environment. 
	Mr Cameron also unveiled figures that showed adoptions have increased by a quarter following efforts to improve the system - and a doubling of funding for relationship counselling through Relate, to £19.5m. 
	""I want every government department to be held to account for the impact of their policies on the family,"" the PM said. 
	""The reality is that in the past the family just hasn't been central to the way government thinks. 
	""So you get a whole load of policy decisions which take no account of the family and sometimes make these things worse. 
	""Whether it's the benefits system incentivising couples to live apart or penalising those who go out to work or whether it's excessive bureaucracy preventing loving couples from adopting children with no family at all. 
	""We can't go on having government taking decisions like this which ignore the impact on the family. 
	""I said previously that we would introduce a family test into government. Now that test is being formalised as part of the impact assessment for all domestic policies. 
	""Put simply, that means every single domestic policy that government comes up with will be examined for its impact on the family."" 
	Education Minister Nick Boles told Sky News: ""It basically will say if you have got a policy, you want to get it through, you have got to be able to demonstrate with evidence that this policy is going to be help families and not in any way do anything to undermine families, and that actually a very powerful tool in government to make sure all policies are furthering that goal."" 
	Mr Cameron's speech comes as the Government prepares to launch an extension of its programme to tackle troubled families, set up by the Prime Minister following the 2011 riots across English cities."

	But the proportion of GCSE exams awarded at least a C grade has risen, official figures show. 
	Just over two thirds (68.8%) of entries scored A*-C, up 0.7 percentage points on last summer, according to statistics published by the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ). 
	The A*-G pass rate is down 0.3 percentage points to 98.5% from 98.8% in 2013. 
	The proportion of entries awarded the highest grade has also fallen slightly, with 6.7% gaining an A*, down from 6.8% last year. 
	It is the third year in a row that this has dropped. 
	Changes to the exam system brought in by Education Secretary Michael Gove have led to warnings of ""volatility"" in this year's results. 
	These include the removal of speaking and listening assessments from English and having less coursework, placing more importance on end-of-year exams. 
	Pupils have also been stopped from sitting exams early for some course units, which facilitated resits. 
	There are concerns the so-called ""Gove effect"" could threaten students chances of getting into a top university or even sixth-form college. 
	Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), which represents many secondary school leaders, said: ""There are individual students who last year, or the year before, with the same work, might have got a higher grade."" 
	Results for England, Wales and Northern Ireland showed a sharp drop in English grades, with 61.7% of entries scoring A*-C, down 1.9% from last summer. 
	This is believed to be the biggest drop in the qualification's history. 
	Meanwhile, maths saw an opposite result, with 62.4% of entries gaining an A*-C grade, up a massive 4.8% on 2013. 
	The statistics also revealed the gender gap has widened at grade C and above this year, with 73.1% of girls' entries scoring A*-C compared with 64.3% of boys'. 
	Michael Turner, director general of the JCQ, said: ""There has been a significant amount of change to the system this year and although UK level figures are relatively stable we expect more schools and colleges to see volatility in their results."" 
	Defending the Government's school reforms, Education Minister Nick Gibb told Sky News said: ""Our education system can't remain static. 
	""It has to improve, it has to compete with the improving standards in other countries around the world."" 
	He added: ""In terms of volatility, we have ended this absurdity where students were being repeatedly entered for re-sits and early entry, and schools that were over-reliant on that approach will have seen some volatility in their results. 
	""By ending this obsession with the exam treadmill we have given more time for teachers to teach and students to learn."""

	Hundreds of mourners, including Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew and team captain Fabricio Coloccini, packed St Mary's Catholic Cathedral in the heart of the city for a service in memory of 28-year-old supermarket worker Liam Sweeney. 
	Football fanatic Mr Sweeney and his friend John Alder, 63, died while on their way to New Zealand to watch Newcastle United play in pre-season friendly matches.

2014-08-21,James Foley's 'British' Killer: What We Know,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140821153438/http://news.sky.com/story/1322492/james-foleys-british-killer-what-we-know,"By Sky News US Team As intelligence officials scramble to identify the black-clad killer of James Foley, few details have emerged. 
	This is what is known so far of the Islamic State (IS) militant who appears in a propaganda video that shows the beheading of Mr Foley. 
:: ""JOHN"" 
	According to a former hostage cited by the Guardian's Martin Chulov, the man calls himself John. 
	He appears to be left-handed and of average height and built.  
:: ACCENT 
	Experts say the man speaks with a southeastern English accent. Some identified it as east London. Other possibilities include Essex and Kent. 
	The voice is one of the things experts will be looking at as they examine the video. Phonetic software will be employed to highlight obvious characteristics in his voice. 
:: BEATLES 
	Mr Chulov told Sky News that, according to the former hostage, John is one of three Britons who act as the guards of foreign prisoners in the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa. 
	Some former hostages refer to this group as ""The Beatles"". 
:: NEGOTIATOR 
	John has been involved in negotiations with relatives of other hostages in the past. He is believed to have conducted negotiations that led to the release of 11 hostages earlier this year. The release was granted in exchange for huge amounts of cash, according to news reports.  
	His face has never been shown, either to hostages or to their relatives in Skype conversations during the negotiations. 
:: LEADER 
	John appears to be in charge of the group. Mr Chulov described him as the ""leader of the pack"". 
	Sky’s Foreign Affairs Editor Sam Kiley said he appears to enjoy a high level of responsibility within the Islamic State. ""This is the interface between IS and the outside world, it's through these hostages. 
	""Therefore this is a senior figure within it."" 
:: WELL EDUCATED 
	The Telegraph reported John was a well-educated, intelligent and highly committed member of IS. Mr Chulov said John likely to have been fighting with IS for at least a year.

Shiraz Maher, a senior researcher at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation, said Mr Foley's beheading is the first time IS has used a ""directly confrontational approach"" to the Western world. 
	Other experts noted that using an English-speaking militant in the brutal video is meant to scare the West by showing that IS has the ability to recruit from the West and hit Western targets."
2014-08-21,House Building 'Back To Pre-Recession Levels',https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140821153438/http://news.sky.com/story/1322544/house-building-back-to-pre-recession-levels,"House building has returned to pre-crash levels, according to the Government. 
	But campaigners warn the number of homes being built remains ""a drop in the ocean"" compared to what is actually needed to meet demand. 
	The number of new homes being started in England is up by nearly a fifth compared with a year ago, official Whitehall figures show. 
	Some 36,230 new houses were started between April and June, marking an 18% increase on the same period a year earlier. 
	However, it was little changed compared to the previous quarter with 36,140 properties started between January and March leading experts to suggest the industry was being held back by material and labour shortages. 
	The latest quarterly figure brings the total number of starts over the last 12 months to 137,780, which is a 22% increase on the previous year and the highest level of house building since 2007, the Government said. 
	It pointed to Help to Buy schemes, which allow people to buy both new-build and existing homes with small deposits, as helping boost the house building numbers. 
	However, critics argue these have contributed to forcing up house prices by fuelling demand, and threaten to create a new housing bubble. 
	The figures also show an estimated 29,540 new-build homes were completed in England between April and June, marking a 6% increase on the previous quarter and 7% higher than the same quarter a year earlier. 
	Housing and planning minister Brandon Lewis said: ""Wherever you look across the housing market, the signs of progress are clear. 
	""House building in England is up by over a fifth compared to last year."" 
	But Paul Diggle, a property economist at Capital Economics, said the slight increase in housing starts compared with the previous quarter suggested material and labour shortages are ""constraining housebuilders' output"". 
	He said: ""Despite the impetus from the Help to Buy equity loan scheme and favourable wider economic conditions, these constraints will keep a lid on house building for a while yet."" 
	And Roger Harding, director of communications, policy and campaigns for the housing charity Shelter, said: ""While this small increase may be heralded as a success, the reality is that the number of homes being built is a drop in the ocean compared to what's actually needed. 
	""The Government has talked about a 'house building revolution' but four years in we've barely seen evolution. Sadly we have the latest in a long line of successive administrations who've failed to deliver the homes that families across the country so desperately need."""
2014-08-21,Sexual Crimes On Britain's Trains Increase,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140821153438/http://news.sky.com/story/1322202/sexual-crimes-on-britains-trains-increase,"By Rhiannon Mills, Sky News Correspondent The number of sexual crimes committed on trains in England, Wales and Scotland  has gone up in the past year. 
	The latest figures released by British Transport Police (BTP) show a 20% increase, with 1,117 sexual offences in 2013/14 compared to 925 in 2012/13. 
	Most were against women but men were also victims. 
	BTP said the increase was slightly higher than that experienced by police forces nationally, but believed it was partly down to people being more willing to report incidents in the wake of high-profile prosecutions of celebrities for historical sexual offences. 
	Overall, for the 10th year in a row, there has been a drop in the number of the most serious crimes committed on Britain's railways, falling from 53,885 to 50,840 in 2012/13 - more than 3,000 fewer offences. 
	It includes a reduction of 18% in recorded robberies, a 17% drop in theft of passenger property and a 37% fall in theft of cable from the railway. 
	Speaking about the rise in sexual offences, BTP Chief Constable Paul Crowther said the force's Project Guardian had had a significant impact. 
	He said the scheme ""focuses on increasing awareness and confidence among the public to report unwanted sexual behaviour to the police or members of staff"". 
	""We are particularly interested in those offences which are often unreported, such as sexual assault, exposure, outraging public decency, lewd comments and harassment,"" he said. 
	""For the coming months and years we will have one simple goal - to make sure everyone who travels or works on the railway can get home every day, safe, secure and on time."" 
	Figures show that 15% of women who have used the underground or trains in London have experienced unwanted sexual behaviour on the network, but 90% did not report it because they did not think it was serious enough. 
	Jodie Mcleay told Sky News that she did not tell police what happened to her on a train at midday from the capital to Luton. 
	She said: ""It was a reasonably packed train and I heard a man behind me and realised he was acting quite inappropriately for that time of day. 
	""I think I was shocked more than anything, a bit disgusted and then didn't know how to react, whether to make a scene."""

	Cardiff City submitted a dossier regarding the conduct of Mackay, who was sacked in December, and former head of recruitment Iain Moody to the FA. 
	It is believed to contain allegations involving homophobic, racist and sexist text messages between the two men. 
	""The FA can confirm it is currently investigating this matter,"" a spokesman said. 
	The investigation was revealed after the 42-year-old Scot was ruled out of becoming the new manager of Premier League Crystal Palace on Wednesday, despite being hotly touted for the position. 
	Betting had been suspended on Mackay becoming the Crystal Palace manager on Tuesday, but the club did not make the expected appointment the following day. 
	Under FA regulations, Cardiff has to report allegations of misconduct. 
	After Mackay was sacked in December 2013, he launched a £7.5m claim for compensation for wrongful dismissal. He dropped the claim in May and issued a public apology. 
	It said: ""Today I have reached a settlement agreement dropping all claims I have made against Cardiff City Football Club. 
	""I do not want to be in litigation and believe that it is in the best interests of all parties to have a clean break and move on. 
	""The club's owner Mr Vincent Tan invested heavily in the club and supported our decisions in our push for promotion to the Premier League. Without him this would not have been possible. 
	""If I have caused any offence to anyone during this time, especially to Vincent Tan, then I apologise without reservation."" 
	Moody resigned from his role as sporting director at Crystal Palace with immediate effect shortly after the FA investigation was announced, the club said. 
	In a statement Crystal Palace said: ""In light of the events of yesterday, sporting director, Iain Moody has tendered his resignation and it has been accepted with immediate effect. 
	""There will be no further comment from the club on this matter."" 
	Moody left Cardiff in October last year."

	The British scientist made the comment in reply to a user who said they would face a ""real ethical dilemma"" if they conceived a baby with the syndrome. 
	Professor Dawkins tweeted: ""Abort it and try again. It would be immoral to bring it into the world if you have the choice."" 
	His tweet sparked a strong reaction, including from one mother who has a child with the condition, who wrote: ""I would fight til my last breath for the life of my son. No dilemma."" 
	The God Delusion author later defended his comment and refused to apologise. 
	Professor Dawkins wrote: ""In point of fact, a majority of Down Syndrome fetuses in Europe and USA are aborted. What I recommended is not outlandish but the norm. 
	""I do not for one moment apologise for approaching moral philosophic questions in a logical way. There's a place for emotion and this isn't it."" 
	In a statement, the Down's Syndrome Association (DSA) said: ""People with Down's Syndrome can and do live full and rewarding lives, they also make a valuable contribution to our society. 
	""At the Down's Syndrome Association, we do not believe Down's Syndrome in itself should be a reason for termination, however, we realise that families must make their own choice. 
	""The DSA strives to ensure that all prospective parents are given accurate and up-to-date information about the condition and what life might be like today for someone with Down's Syndrome."" 
	Richard Dawkins has provoked anger on Twitter before, when he said the world's Muslims had won fewer Nobel Prizes than Trinity College Cambridge."

	The Back To Black singer will be immortalised when the bronze is shown to the public on September 14 - which would have been her birthday. 
	The original plan was for the statue to be placed in the Roundhouse music venue in Camden Town, north London, but it will now be in the nearby Stables Market. 
	Winehouse fought a public battle with drink and drugs and was found dead, aged 27, at her home in the capital in 2011. 
	Her family set up the Amy Winehouse Foundation to help young people with problems including addiction. 
	""The Roundhouse would have been great as Amy and the Foundation have a great affinity with the venue, but it would not always have been accessible for fans, we wanted people to be able to see it, touch and interact,"" her father Mitch said. 
	""Now Amy will oversee the comings and goings of her home town forever. 
	""Amy was in love with Camden and it is the place her fans from all over the world associate her with."" 
	The statue was made by sculptor Scott Eaton."
2014-08-21,Looking Into the Interest Rate Crystal Ball,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140821153438/http://news.sky.com/story/1321856/looking-into-the-interest-rate-crystal-ball,"By Ian King, Business Presenter It is certainly dramatic news, on the face of it, that two members of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) have voted to raise interest rates. 
	After all, no MPC member has voted to tighten monetary policy since July 2011. 
	Yet the development is not as startling as it might have seemed. Many market commentators had been speculating, in advance of the minutes being published at 9.30am on Wednesday, that this would be the month in which the MPC's unanimity finally disappeared. 
	That the two MPC members who did vote to raise Bank rate were Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty also came as no surprise. 
	The hugely respected Mr Weale, in particular, is a fiercely independent soul. For example, he was a dissenting voice when the Bank, under its then-new Governor Mark Carney, introduced a policy of 'forward guidance' last year. 
	Moreover, as recently as June, Mr Weale gave a speech during which he indicated that he thought there was less slack in the economy - the key measure that Mr Carney has said will now guide interest rate policy - than the 1% to 1.5%of GDP that the Bank's quarterly inflation report in May was suggesting. 
	Since then, there has been further evidence that slack in the economy has fallen away, most notably with the continued fall in unemployment at a rate that continues to surprise. 
	Mr Weale has also previously indicated that he favours raising the Bank rate this year because - as he stated in an interview with Sky News in February this year - it would be difficult to do so during the run-up to the General Election. 
	So his vote ought to have come as no shock. 
	Mr McCafferty, meanwhile, also nailed his colours to the mast during a speech in June in which he said that an early rise in interest rates would enable the MPC to move more gradually and in a way that would minimise disruption to households and businesses. 
	So his vote should really be no surprise either. 
	What will confuse some, though, is that details of the vote come just days after the Bank's latest quarterly inflation report struck a markedly more dovish tone. 
	This is not the first time that the MPC minutes have appeared to be at odds with the way in which Mr Carney has presented the inflation report. 
	The big question households and businesses will now be asking is whether this makes an early rise in Bank rate more likely. The answer is - only slightly. 
	There is an outside chance that the committee will raise the base rate before Christmas - November would be the likeliest month as Mr Carney would then be able to explain the move at that month's quarterly inflation report press conference - but more likely is that the MPC will wait until February next year. 
	These latest minutes note that, for most MPC members, there is ""insufficient evidence of inflationary pressures to justify an immediate rise in Bank rate"". 
	And that was before the latest figures published on Tuesday showed Consumer Price Index of inflation falling from 1.9% to 1.6% and further away from the Bank's 2% target rate. 
	Inflation is likely to remain benign in coming months and not least because of the current softness in oil prices. 
	So a rise in Bank rate early next year, rather than this side of Christmas, remains the way to bet."
2014-08-21,Rail Fare Rises Put Pressure On Chancellor,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140821153438/http://news.sky.com/story/1321272/rail-fare-rises-put-pressure-on-chancellor,"Hundreds of thousands of train commuters are facing ticket price increases of 3.5% from next January - almost three times the rate of average wage growth - increasing pressure on the Chancellor. 
	Annual fare increases are based on the retail price index for July, a measure of inflation which includes housing costs, which the Office for National Statistics has calculated at 2.5%. 
	Rail companies are allowed to increase fares at a rate of July Retail Prices Index plus 1%, which means that most rail users travel costs will go up by 3.5%. However, on a limited number of routes, fares can be increased by a further 2%. 
	Based on the Bank of England’s recent forecast that average wages will increase by 1.25% this year, it means that commuters will have to spend more of their disposable income on getting to work. 
	Martin Abrams, of the Campaign for Better Transport, said: ""By deliberately ramping up rail fares, [the]Government is hitting the living standards of everyone who relies on the train to get to work. 
	""There are the large numbers of rail commuters living in marginal constituencies. They will be looking to Government to bring a permanent end to this annual fiasco."" 
	The Government is being urged to revise its rules for fare increases. 
	Passenger Focus said despite expensive commuter fares, occasional travellers can get some of the cheapest fares in Europe - if bookings are made several months in advance. 
	It said British rail operators are increasingly using an airline-style pricing structure, with last-minute bookings much higher in price. 
	But the minister responsible, Claire Perry MP, told Sky News that above inflation increases are needed to fund the redevelopment of the country's rail infrastructure. 
	""There is an unprecedented investment and it is a rail renaissance,"" Ms Perry said. 
	""The challenge is making sure fares are fair and commuters can travel in comfort."" 
	Protests have been organised at more than 40 train stations around the country by trade union activists, who say it is another reflection on how privatisation has failed and consumers would be better served by bringing back British Rail. 
	""People will simply be priced off the railways while the greedy train operating companies are laughing all the way to the bank,"" RMT acting general secretary Mick Cash said. 
	""We are once again ratcheting up the highest rail fares in Europe to travel on some of the most clapped-out and overcrowded services."" 
	Last year, in his Autumn Statement, Chancellor George Osborne intervened to limit this past year's increase to just the RPI figure. 
	Campaigners have warned that, with a General Election looming next spring, he will come under pressure to do so again."

They win no hearts and minds; they can build no democracies. There are more tools of statecraft than military power."" 
	David Cameron, as leader of the opposition in 2006, flash forward to today and the Prime Minister’s language seems more strident, the warnings more stark. 
	""If we do not act to stem the onslaught of this exceptionally dangerous terrorist movement, it will only grow stronger until it can target us on the streets of Britain. 
	""We are in the middle of a generational struggle against a poisonous and extremist ideology."" 
	This as the Bishop of Leeds has accused the government of not having  a ""coherent or comprehensive approach to Islamist extremism as it is developing across the globe"". 
	But is this a fair assessment? 
	It is certainly true, like President Obama, scarred by interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan, the plan was to withdraw British troops from conflicts and not get involved in more. 
	After all, defence spending has been cut and the army is on course to be smaller than at any time since the First World War. 
	All this changed with Benghazi, Libya in 2011 when Britain with France lead airstrikes to stop a massacre and ultimately bring down Colonel Gaddafi. 
	Two years later and it was Syria; the Prime Minister thought Assad had to go and that meant helping the rebels, a deliberate interventionist strategy, which won round President Obama, only to fall apart in Parliament when it was opposed by Ed Miliband. 
	Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria - different conflicts with different ends but all interventions the Prime Minister has supported or called for. 
	So why not Iraq this time, given the humanitarian need and the 'poisonous' threat of the Islamic State? 
	Well, firstly we are involved, not with airstrikes but, increasingly, British military capability is helping to deliver aid or helping with surveillance. 
	Undoubtedly scarred by the Syria vote last year, and concerns about public opinion, the Prime Minister is more hesitant about joining the Americans in dropping bombs. 
	But with public opinion so far accepting of intervention, Britain has inch-by-inch, day-by-day been getting more militarily involved. 
	Given the threat by Islamic State, that is only likely to continue."

	An officer is heard repeatedly shouting ""He's gonna hit us"" as the Honda Jazz travels towards them at 50mph in the dark on the M6 toll road near Lichfield. 
	The police dashboard camera then captures the moment the officers deliberately crash into the car, being driven by a 77-year-old man with dementia. 
	The police driver is heard telling his colleague: ""I had to mate."" The officer replies: ""I know you did, I know you did."" 
	The police force has praised the bravery of the traffic officers for choosing to engineer the collision to prevent the car from hitting oncoming traffic. 
	The male driver, from Rowley Regis in the West Midlands, had earlier been reported missing by his family. 
	He was not hurt in the crash on the northbound carriageway of the motorway. One of the officers suffered a minor injury in Monday's incident. 
	Inspector Greg Jennings, force traffic manager, said: ""Traffic officers are highly trained to make good decisions in difficult situations and a very challenging environment. 
	""These officers have kept their resolve in the face of a serious threat to ensure the safety of the public directly behind them."" 
	Inspector Mark Watkins, of Central Motorway Police Group, said the officers hit the side of the car in a manoeuvre usually used in pursuits. 
	""It's a recognised pursuit tactic in order to bring incidents to a conclusion,"" he said."

	Industry figures released on Thursday showed that the average car exported was worth over £20,600 today compared to £10,200 in 2004. 
	The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) reported a 2.9% increase in cars made for export last month, taking the export market for the period since 2010 to the five million mark. 
	Wider car manufacturing also accelerated last month, with 132,570 cars made in the UK in July - a 2.8% rise on the figure for July 2013. 
	Last month's total took the year-to-date figure to 923,884 - a 3.4% increase on the total for the first seven months of last year. 
	SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said: ""This is testament to the burgeoning reputation of UK automotive excellence and demand for British-made cars. 
	""Significantly, UK car export values have doubled over the past decade - reflecting the diversity of the products we make and proving the sector's worth as a global investment opportunity."" 
	The country's car industry accounts for 10% of total UK export of goods and its contribution to the recovery in manufacturing output has been significant, given efforts to rebalance the UK's economy in the wake of the financial crisis. 
	Exports have been on the rise again this year following several years of falling demand in the euro area - with China among the countries seeing high demand for high-value vehicles from UK manufacturers, including Jaguar Land Rover. 
	Mr Hawes told Sky News: ""The UK couldn't compete with low-cost countries in terms of huge volume manufacturing so by focussing on more premium products, with high value-added content and high engineering levels, it really ensures that the UK is competitive globally."" 
	John Leech, head of automotive for the auditor KPMG, said of the figures: ""UK car production continues to climb steadily, a trend we expect to continue for the next three years bolstered by exciting new launches such as the Jaguar XE and the new Vauxhall Astra. 
	""The figures show the price of cars exported by the UK has doubled in the past decade underlining how the UK has successfully moved up the value-chain to become predominantly a producer of luxury cars and higher-priced volume cars such as the Nissan Qashqai crossover. 
	""Other Western European countries will be looking enviously at the UK as these vehicles provide a stable and profitable platform giving suppliers the confidence to invest, which they are doing."""

	The report, commissioned by Gloucestershire Safeguarding Children Board (GSCB), came after the children's parents were found guilty and jailed for neglecting five of their children between 2007 and 2012. 
	It revealed that teachers, doctors, health professionals and social workers knew about the family over a 16-year period but did not take any formal action until one of the children was admitted to hospital with severe nappy rash. 
	The senior case review into the family - who cannot be named for legal reasons - found five ""missed opportunities"" for the authorities to intervene which were not taken because neglect was not treated as seriously as other forms of abuse. 
	It found 127 recorded contacts between the family and primary health care professionals over a 27-month period. 
	The children were seen by GPs amid complaints from teachers and health workers that the children were suffering with tooth decay, poor growth and weight gain, delayed development, anaemia, poor hygiene and severe nappy rash. 
	The review found there was continuing evidence that the parents often turned away health professionals and the mother put her own needs above those of her children. 
	The children's grandmother admitted her daughter was ""manipulative and aggressive"" and very controlling, with GPs observing she was very ""skilled at playing off one agency against the other"". 
	""One of the most concerning issues in this case is the apparent lack of understanding, at the time, of neglect and its impact by a number of the key professionals working with this family,"" the report said. 
	""All of the signs were there, and had been for many years, that these children were suffering or likely to suffer significant harm due to neglect. 
	""At the time, there were clear difficulties in ensuring that all of the information on all of the children was available to be considered and drawn together in order to ensure a complete picture. 
	""A child protection conference would have allowed all the professionals involved to share the history of the family and the current concerns in a setting chaired by an independent person, where the parents could not have decided who was involved and who was not."" 
	David McCallum, chair of the GSCB, said the authorities involved had underestimated the impact of long-term neglect. 
	""For most of the time when children's social care and other agencies were working with this family, they treated the neglect as a 'child in need' issue and that probably underestimated the extent of the harm those children were suffering,"" Mr McCallum said. 
	""One of the real points of learning for all the organisations involved is that neglect can be really, really harmful to children, especially when it's long-term."""

	The millionaire pop star, who is facing an historical sex assault allegation, was to receive the region's top civic honour on Wednesday. 
	A dozen others were given medals of merit during a day of celebrations to mark the granting of an ancient charter. 
	Sir Cliff told officials he would not be there and stayed in his villa in the hills above the Algarve resort where he has had a summer home for more than 50 years. 
	Mayor Carlos Silva e Sousa told Sky News: ""Cliff was to receive the gold Key of the City because he is a distinguished member of Albufeira. 
	""He is not here today because it is his choice, but we have kept the invitation and hope to give him his award some time."" 
	The city's full council voted in secret and unanimously to make the award two weeks ago. 
	The mayor said Sir Cliff had planned to attend the ceremony but sent a message recently to say he had to decline the invitation. 
	Mr Silva e Sousa added that he was aware of the police investigation into an allegation that Sir Cliff had sexually assaulted a young boy at an evangelical rally in Sheffield in 1985. 
	He said: ""I don't know why he is not here. It doesn't change my opinion of him. We are very proud of him. He is a big man."" 
	Officials said they had agreed with Sir Cliff's decision because his presence would have overshadowed the ceremony. 
	The medals of merit were awarded to three individuals - one posthumously - and nine organisations who were said to have promoted Albufeira around the world. 
	Sir Cliff bought his first villa here in 1961 in a resort that has become popular with British holidaymakers. 
	Twenty years ago he bought a bigger home and planted a vineyard on a plot near a bigger estate where he makes his own wine in partnership with a friend. 
	He spends several weeks at his Portugal home each summer, usually arriving after visiting the Wimbledon tennis championships and staying until September. 
	He has rarely been glimpsed on the 30-acre estate since police raided his UK home in Berkshire last week. 
	Sir Cliff has also pulled out of a performance at Canterbury Cathedral in September and apologised for the disappointment and inconvenience. 
	He has described the sex allegation as ""completely false"" and said he would co-operate with the police investigation. 
	Detectives said they want to speak to him and are expected to interview him in the next few weeks. 
	Sir Cliff's close friend Cilla Black said earlier this week she is ""absolutely positive"" the allegation is untrue."

2014-08-21,Labour Pledge To Get Tough With Energy Firms,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140821153438/http://news.sky.com/story/1322210/labour-pledge-to-get-tough-with-energy-firms,"Energy companies' licences could be revoked by a new regulator to help protect the interests of the public under a Labour government, the party has announced. 
	Shadow energy and climate change secretary Caroline Flint said the current Government had helped create a ""broken energy market"". 
	And she said Labour would give a tough new regulator the power to cancel energy firms' licences if they repeatedly commit the most ""serious and deliberate breaches of their licence conditions which harm the interests of consumers"". 
	Figures show energy companies have continued to ""mistreat their customers"" and face another 16 investigations into mis-selling, poor customer service and other bad practice. 
	This comes despite Ofgem issuing 30 fines, worth a total of more than £87m, since 2001. 
	Ms Flint said Labour's reforms would see the regulator producing an annual scorecard for energy suppliers, reporting on the firm's performance and identifying areas of concern. 
	She claimed household energy bills had risen twice as fast as inflation and four times as fast as wages since 2010 - and that UK energy prices had risen faster than almost anywhere else in the developed world since Labour lost office. 
	""The public have a right to be treated fairly by energy companies,"" she said. 
	""Where firms fail to meet these standards, there must be tough and decisive action. Too often energy companies seem to view the regulator's fines as a cost of doing business - not as a warning to get their act together."" 
	She insisted that Ofgem's current powers to revoke a supplier's licence did not go far enough. 
	Ms Flint told Sky News: ""They can revoke a licence if a company doesn't pay a fine or comply with an order. 
	""What we're saying is if there is persistent evidence that they continue to deliberately undermine their customers through bad practice, then all these things should be taken into account."" 
	Labour says information disclosed by Ofgem under the Freedom of Information Act, shows it currently has 12 investigations ongoing and a further four at informal review stage. 
	Responding, a Conservative spokesman said: ""We'll take no lectures from the party that brought Britain's economy to its knees. 
	""Labour left our country with a broken energy market and huge taxes on bills - meaning the number of people in fuel poverty nearly doubled in Labour's last five years. 
	""We're carrying out a full, independent inquiry to fix the broken market we inherited. And we're forcing energy companies to simplify bills so people can be sure they are getting the best deal."" 
	An Ofgem spokesperson said: ""Ofgem is always interested to work with government on any new powers or refinements to existing powers which would help to further protect consumers. 
	""Ofgem does currently have powers to revoke licences in certain specific circumstances including where companies have failed to comply with particular enforcement orders we have set requiring them to change or stop behaviours."""

	Emergency services were called to the property but the child died at the scene. 
	The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has confirmed the death.

2014-08-21,Drunk Man Sneaked On Empty Birmingham Plane,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140821153438/http://news.sky.com/story/1321944/drunk-man-sneaked-on-empty-birmingham-plane,"A man who managed to get through layers of airport security before boarding an empty plane via a baggage carousel said he was too drunk to remember how he did it. 
	Lee Jezard pleaded guilty at Birmingham Magistrates Court to evading security measures at Birmingham Airport and boarding a Lufthansa plane on July 17. 
	Jezard - who lost his job as a hotel manager when his employer learned about his antics - also admitted stealing £36.45 worth of foodstuffs from the airport's Caffe Nero. 
	Prosecutor David Devine said a study of all plane manifests revealed Jezard ""was never booked onto any flight"", despite reports he was at the airport after missing a flight to Ibiza. 
	He described the actions of Jezard, of  Redditch, Worcestershire, as a ""drunken escapade"". 
	In mitigation, solicitor Tariq Khan said his client ""really had very little idea how he arrived at the airport"" after going on a drinking binge with friends in Birmingham city centre. 
	It emerged in court that police had already spoken to a ""wandering"" and ""clearly intoxicated"" Jezard, after spotting him in other parts of the airport in the hours before the security breach. 
	It was the same police officer who later ""frog-marched him off the aeroplane"" after he was found on board. 
	In a further ""bizarre"" act, Mr Khan added, Jezard was seen on CCTV behind a coffee shop counter at the deserted airport ""charging his mobile and checking it"". 
	He was discovered on the plane by cleaning staff, who he told: ""I'm the co-pilot"". 
	""When they asked him for ID, he had none, and then told them 'I work for the Navy',"" Mr Devine said. 
	""He then said: 'I'm breaking into places to see if people can catch me - I go to prisons and other places'."" 
	He was later arrested and interviewed by airport police. 
	He told officers: ""I was trying to show how easy it was to get on that plane - and I did it."" 
	Jezard struggled to recall everything that had happened, telling police he ""wanted a walk around and thought it would be a good idea"". 
	Security cameras showed Jezard crawling through the opening of a baggage carousel, getting on to the airport's tarmac apron, and then getting aboard the plane. 
	Mr Khan said his client ""really had very little idea how it was he arrived at the airport, but the guess is it was by train"". 
	Jezard was fined £95 for each of the three offences, ordered to pay full compensation to the coffee shop, together with £185 costs and a £20 victim surcharge. 
	Following the hearing, an airport spokesperson said: ""The safety and security of our passengers is our number one priority. 
	""The individual penetrated the terminal boundary and was subsequently arrested by the police. A full investigation has taken place."""

	Detectives made the arrests in Londonderry, the Police Service of Northern Ireland said. 
	The two men, 35 and 46, and two women, 21 and 44, have been taken to the PSNI's Serious Crime Suite in Antrim. 
	Devices described as crude but potentially explosive were mailed to seven Army careers offices in southeast England in February. 
	They were discovered in Oxford, Brighton, Canterbury, Aldershot, Reading, Chatham and the Queensmere shopping centre in Slough. 
	Last October, another series of letter bombs were sent to high profile political and security figures, including one addressed to Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers at Stormont Castle in Belfast. 
	In March this year, two more devices were intercepted at postal sorting offices in Lisburn and Derry.  
	Both were addressed to Maghaberry high security prison in Co Antrim. 
	None of the devices exploded."

	The legislation is aimed at protecting victims whose partners threaten them with violence, cut them off from friends or refuse them access to money. 
	Home Secretary Theresa May is looking at creating a new offence which would give emotional abuse the same status under law as physical abuse. 
	Currently non-violent coercive and controlling behaviour is covered by legislation that concentrates on stalking and harassment. This does not explicitly apply to intimate relationships. 
	Polly Neate, Women's Aid chief executive, said: ""This is a vital step forward for victims of domestic violence. 
	""Two women a week are killed by domestic violence, and in our experience of working with survivors, coercive controlling behaviour is at the heart of the most dangerous abuse."" 
	The Home Secretary said: ""The Government is clear that abuse is not just physical. Victims who are subjected to a living hell by their partners must have the confidence to come forward. 
	""Meanwhile, I want perpetrators to be in no doubt that their cruel and controlling behaviour is criminal."" 
	The Government has also introduced the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme, known as Clare's Law after 36-year-old Clare Wood who was murdered by her ex-boyfriend in 2009, which enables the police to disclose information about previous violent offending by a partner. 
	And the introduction earlier this year of Domestic Violence Protection Orders means perpetrators of domestic abuse can be prevented from returning to the home for up to 28 days."
2014-08-27,Rotherham Abuse: Police Boss Refuses To Quit,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140827110635/http://news.sky.com/story/1325507/rotherham-abuse-police-chief-refuses-to-quit,"South Yorkshire's Police and Crime Commissioner is resisting growing calls to resign over the Rotherham child abuse scandal - claiming he was unaware of the scale of the problem. 
	Shaun Wright, who was responsible for children's services at the town council for five of the 16 years when at least 1,400 children were abused, is being urged to stand down, including by his own Labour Party. 
	Mr Wright told Sky News he was ""completely astonished"" at the extent of the abuse revealed in a damning report, which told of 11-year-olds being gang raped and children being forced to watch violent sex abuse while being threatened they would be next. 
	But Professor Alexis Jay, who headed the inquiry, cast doubt on claims people had been unaware of the problem, which had been set out ""unambiguously"" in seminars and reports. 
	She also told Sky News nearly everyone in positions of authority should have done more. 
	Home Secretary Theresa May also piled pressure on Mr Wright to stand down from his £85,000-a-year job, saying he ""has real questions to answer"". 
	Sky News Senior Political Correspondent Jon Craig said there was now so much pressure on Mr Wright to resign, ""I'd be very surprised if he's still in his post by later on this evening."" 
	Mr Wright was a Labour councillor for Rotherham until he was elected Police Commissioner in 2012, and was in charge of children's services from 2005 to 2010. 
	He told Sky News he was ""completely astonished"" at the abuse, and said he had been unaware of the scale of the problem. 
	He said: ""I take my share of the responsibility. There was systemic failure. I only wish that I knew more at the time. 
	""If I knew then what I know now then clearly more could have been done. 
	""I do have regrets I wasn't more aware of the issue at the time."" 
	He claimed information was not ""escalated up"" to the political level or senior managers. 
	But pointing to a number of seminars and reports detailing the abuse, Prof Jay told Sky News: ""I would be surprised if anyone could say at the end of that, they didn't know."" 
	Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper told Sky News: ""The Labour party has said that the Police and Crime Commissioner should stand down, just as the leader of the council has done, because 1,400 children were abused and they were let down badly by the authorities."" 
	Roger Stone, the leader of Rotherham Council, stepped down with immediate effect following the publication of the report. 
	Chief Superintendent Jason Harwin, police district commander for Rotherham, said no officers had faced disciplinary action but added: ""A number of individuals that were in the service then are no longer in the service."" 
	Solicitor David Greenwood, who represents some of the victims, told Sky News they intend to take legal action against the authorities."

	A damning report on abuse in the South Yorkshire town detailed examples of 11-year-olds being gang raped and children forced to watch violent sex abuse. 
	Barnardo's was called to the town by police last year to tackle the problem - but the charity says it is also working with other councils to ""learn lessons from the past"". 
	Chief executive Javed Khan told Sky News: ""Barnardo's is working very closely with that council and many other councils across the country. 
	""We're trying to help those professionals learn lessons from the past. 
	""This is happening all over the country - it isn't just peculiar to Rotherham. 
	""It's important that they learn the lessons from the past, work with agencies like ours that have experience. 
	""We work with more than 2,000 children who've been sexually exploited every year. We know how to spot the signs and put it right."" 
	The report on abuse in Rotherham, between 1997 and 2013, said authorities in the town ""could and should"" have done more to stop the abuse. 
	But officials did not listen to children trying to report it, the report said. 
	Council leader Roger Stone resigned after the report was published - and there have been calls for South Yorkshire's Police Commissioner to follow. 
	Shaun Wright was elected in 2012 - but his previous role as a councillor put him in charge of children's services between 2005 and 2010. 
	However, Mr Khan insists it is important the victims are not forgotten amid the ""recriminations"". 
	""I'm sure Shaun Wright is doing some deep thinking about what he did and what he could have done differently - many other people will be doing as well,"" he said. 
	""Apart from the recriminations, the important thing is that we learn the lessons about how to protect children. 
	""Whatever actions need to be taken, let's focus on the victims and make sure this never, ever happens again to children who need our support. 
	""I'm not sitting on the fence. Children were failed. But the report says children's services in Rotherham are fit for purpose now - that's what interests me. 
	""What we're trying to do is work with the schools, work with the police, work with the social services, so they're more aware and more able to spot the signs of children who need our support."""

	HMRC said it is ""excellent news for all honest taxpayers"" and released images of a further five people it wants to track down. 
	These are: Ahmed Salim Khezri, Norbert Dombo, Mohammed Kasim Farook (aka Mohammed Kasim), Paul Edwards and Murugasan Natarajan (aka Murucasan Natarajan and Raj Natarajan). 
	Those who have been apprehended in the last year are: 
:: John Sabin, who fled to Spain after being convicted for his role in smuggling more than 150 million illicit cigarettes into the UK 
:: Malcolm McGowan, who also fled to Spain before he could be sentenced for smuggling more than 28 million cigarettes 
:: Magdalena Ferkova, returned from the Czech Republic after being found guilty of tax credit and child benefit fraud 
:: Michael Voudouri, who fled to northern Cyprus prior to sentencing after being found guilty of an £11.6m money laundering scam 
:: Michael Fearon, who fled to the Republic of Ireland while on trial for his part in smuggling more than 8 million cigarettes 
	Jennie Granger, HMRC's Director General of Enforcement and Compliance, said: ""This is down to the determination of our people with the help and support of the general public. 
	""We would like to thank the public for that help, and ask them to look at the 2014 list and help us to bring back the rest. 
	""These fugitives were involved in frauds that have collectively cost the UK more than  £844 million but the success of our campaign means those on the run should know that HMRC will relentlessly pursue them."" 
	HMRC said it had also received ""important information"" on the location of five other people on its ""most wanted"" list. 
	It is two years since HMRC first published images of its top tax fraud absconders, and since then the pictures have been viewed three million times, leading to the capture of some of the fugitives. 
	There is also a map showing where HMRC believes the remaining people on the list to be. 
	HMRC says that, where legally possible, it will seek extraditions with the help of the Crown Prosecution Service and other partners in the UK and abroad to ensure they are brought back to the UK.

	John Bercow has nominated Australian Carol Mills for the role following an open recruitment process - but senior figures have raised concerns about her lack of knowledge about Westminster procedures. 
	Bernard Jenkin, chairman of the public administration select committee, says a meeting will be held on Monday to decide if a hearing is required to assess her suitability. 
	The Tory MP for Harwich and North Essex said: ""The committee has decided nothing formally until we meet. 
	""(But) I have spoken to a majority of the committee and those I have spoken to are in favour of holding such a hearing."" 
	Ms Mills is currently head of the Department of Parliamentary Services (DPS) in Canberra. 
	The row took a sinister twist when it was revealed that officials in Ms Mills' department used CCTV cameras to spy on the office of an Australian senator as part of an investigation into a parliamentary official. 
	The Speaker is believed to want to bring in an outsider to press ahead with modernisation of the House, rather than promoting deputy clerk David Natzler. 
	It is thought 50 MPs, including former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, are backing a motion tabled by Tory backbencher Jesse Norman calling for a pre-appointment hearing. 
	Downing Street upped the pressure on Mr Bercow by insisting the new clerk needs to have the backing of MPs. 
	A spokesman for the Prime Minister also confirmed he had yet to pass on the nomination to the Queen for approval. 
	The clerk earns £200,000 a year and combines the roles of constitutional adviser and Commons chief executive. 
	In an effort to defuse the row, Mr Bercow has indicated he wants to split the functions into two jobs as soon as possible. 
	However, his former deputy, Nigel Evans, says there will be ""a lot of unhappy people"" when the Commons returns unless there is a delay in the process."

has been sold to a private collector for £403,000. 
	Mobile Lovers, showing a couple embracing while checking their phones, appeared on a doorway next to the Broad Plain Working With Young People club in April. 
	Dennis Stinchcombe, owner of the club, told Sky News he received death threats over his decision to sell the work after the elusive artist wrote him a letter confirming it was his stencil. 
	Mr Stinchcombe moved Mobile Lovers into a corridor and invited members of the public to come and view it, with donations optional. 
	He told Sky's Eamonn Holmes he made the decision because he felt the work was at risk from being stolen. 
	""It did get silly. There were a couple of death threats that I had, people were offering silly sums of money,"" he said. 
	Mr Stinchcombe welcomed the sale of the piece and thanked Banksy for saving the youth club, which has operated in Bristol for 120 years. 
	""We are incredibly lucky to have Banksy donate their piece to our club,"" he told a packed press conference at the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery. 
	""Within 12 months we could have well been closed, which means 120 years of exceptional youth work in Bristol would have been lost. 
	""That would have been a tragedy for Bristol."" 
	The club was facing closure earlier this year and required £120,000 to survive - until the Banksy stencil arrived next to the club's gates."

	More than three quarters of authorities in England claim they have not received enough cash from the Government to create the extra school places needed by 2017. 
	The research by the Local Government Association (LGA) is released as concern grows about a squeeze on school places fuelled in part by a rising birth rate and changes in local populations. 
	Councillor David Simmonds, chairman of the LGA's children and young people's board, said: ""The scale of this black hole is such that the cost of the creation of new school places cannot be met by council taxpayers. 
	""The lack of school places is no longer confined to primary schools but is spreading to secondary schools, and across the country we estimate more than 200,000 places will be needed. 
	""Councils face a challenge to create places on time and in the right areas, in a climate where they are also short of money to do so."" 
	Local councils were asked by the LGA if money provided by the Department for Education (DfE) had fully met the cost of providing school places between 2011/12 and 2016/17. 
	Of those that responded - around 79 councils - a total of 77% said the funding had not been enough. 
	More than a third (38%) of the councils who said they did not receive enough funding said they had borrowed money, two thirds (67%) used money from developers, over a fifth (22%) took funds from other building programmes and half (50%) used cash from other school projects, such as school building maintenance, the LGA said. 
	The LGA claims 130,000 new places will be needed by 2017/18, along with 80,716 new secondary places by 2019/2020. 
	A DfE spokeswoman said: ""We are making every effort to stop an unprecedented increase in pupil numbers affecting class sizes, and councils have a legal duty to provide school places for children in their area. 
	""We have also confirmed a further £2.35bn to support councils to create the places needed by September 2017. 
	""In addition we are allowing good schools to expand without the restrictions and bureaucracy they faced in the past. 
	""And there are now more than 320 free schools open or in the pipeline which will provide a further 175,000 places - the vast majority of which are in areas of need."""

	Ahead of the independence referendum on September 18 the signatories, including Weir Group chief executive Keith Cochrane - who organised the letter - and Co-op Bank boss Niall Booker, argue the business case for independence ""has not been made"". 
	In the letter - signed by each in a ""personal capacity"" and published after the last of the televised debates between the leaders of the Yes and No camps - they state: ""As job creators, we have looked carefully at the arguments made by both sides of the debate. 
	""Our conclusion is that the business case for independence has not been made. 
	""Uncertainty surrounds a number of vital issues including currency, regulation, tax, pensions, EU membership and support for our exports around the world - and uncertainty is bad for business"". 
	The comments echo the sentiments expressed in an interview with Sky News on Tuesday by the chief executive of the world's largest advertising firm WPP, Sir Martin Sorrell. 
	The open letter, which also contained signatures from Victor Chavez of Thales UK, Ian Curle of Famous Grouse producer The Edrington Group and Douglas Flint, group chairman of HSBC Holdings, warned that much was at stake. 
	It said: ""Our economic ties inside the United Kingdom are very close and support almost one million Scottish jobs. 
	""The rest of the UK is Scotland's biggest market by far. 
	""Today Scotland's economy is growing. We are attracting record investment and the employment rate is high. 
	""We should be proud that Scotland is a great place to build businesses and create jobs - success that has been achieved as an integral part of the United Kingdom. 
	""The United Kingdom gives business the strong platform we must have to invest in jobs and industry. By all continuing to work together, we can keep Scotland flourishing."" 
	Mr Cochrane told Sky News the letter expressed a ""deep frustration"" within the Scottish business community that there had been a lack of clear answers from the Yes campaign to some basic economic questions. 
	The other side of the debate also has powerful supporters, with former RBS chairman Sir George Mathewson among them. 
	He had previously written that warnings that the size of Scotland's banking system would make independence impossible were ""unionist scaremongering"". 
	Business for Scotland, a pro-independence network, responded to the letter by insisting its 2,500 supporters had made informed opinions. 
	Its statement said: ""It's a position reached after looking at the facts and figures and realising that, from a simple balance sheet point of view as well as other considerations, our best interests lie in becoming an independent country."""

	Gabriel Madiye, of the Shepherd Hospice in Freetown, said Will Pooley had told him he believes he will recover in a little as two weeks. 
	The 29-year-old nurse is being treated in an isolation ward at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, north London, after being flown back to the UK from West Africa on Sunday. 
	There has been no word from doctors at the hospital on his progress but Mr Madiye said Mr Pooley had been confident he would pull through. 
	Mr Madiye said: ""Will told me that he has been seriously ill and tested for ebola and he told me I don't need to help him because he's already being helped by the British government. 
	""(He told me) that he will be treated in England and he is very optimistic that he will recover in a matter of two weeks and after that he will come back to me."" 
	Up to 90% of people who catch ebola die from the virus. 
	The World Health Organisation says that more than 2,500 people have died as a result of the latest outbreak in West Africa so far. 
	Mr Pooley, from Eyke, in Suffolk, worked at the hospice in Freetown before moving to the ebola centre in Kenema, Sierra Leone, where he was infected. 
	He was airlifted back to Britain by a specially equipped C-17 RAF jet, and is being treated by doctors clad in protective plastic clothing, gloves and masks. 
	Experts said his treatment could take weeks, if not longer, and there is no guarantee he will survive. 
	His family have said they were confident he could not be treated at any ""better place"". 
	Days before he contracted the disease, he told The Guardian newspaper about the joy of seeing ebola victims make a full recovery. 
	He said: ""It's great seeing them walk away after some of them have been in a terrible state. Seeing them on the wards and then seeing them recover and walk out the door is great."" 
	Friends have paid tribute to his bravery after he left Freetown and went to Kenema because workers were falling ill. 
	Oliver Johnson, who worked with him in Sierra Leone, said he was an ""extraordinary guy"" who knew the risks but was prepared to take them for the patients. 
	Dr Robert Garry, an American colleague at the hospital, said: ""He saw the need. He read about our nurses who were unfortunately dying there and took it on himself to come over and volunteer and learned how to be as safe as he could. 
	""But when you work hard like that ... you're going to make a mistake and unfortunately that seems to have happened in this case."""

2014-08-27,RBS Fined £14.5m For Mortgage Advice Failures,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140827110635/http://news.sky.com/story/1325358/rbs-fined-14-5m-for-mortgage-advice-failures,"The City regulator has imposed a £14.5m fine on Royal Bank of Scotland and NatWest for ""serious failings"" in mortgage advice. 
	News of the penalty - first revealed by Sky News on Tuesday evening - was released by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) following reviews of the banks' sales processes carried out in 2012. 
	Problems included affordability assessments failing to consider the full extent of a customer’s budget when making a recommendation and not advising customers what mortgage term was appropriate for them. 
	The FCA said only two of the 164 sales it reviewed were considered to meet the standard required - with some advisers even giving personal views on the future movement of interest rates, an action the regulator described as ""highly inappropriate"". 
	It said such views may have resulted in the borrower being sold the wrong type of mortgage and the banks did not adequately address the failings when concerns were first raised. 
	Tracey McDermott, director of enforcement and financial crime at the FCA said: ""Taking out a mortgage is one of the most important financial decisions we can make. 
	""Poor advice could cost someone their home so it’s vital that the advice process is fit for purpose. 
	""We made our concerns clear to the firms in November 2011 but it was almost a year later before the firms started to take proper steps to put things right. 
	""The firms have agreed to contact around 30,000 consumers who received mortgage advice in the relevant period, to allow them to raise any concerns they have about the advice they received."" 
	RBS told Sky News it believed that approximately four in every 100 direct mortgage customers ""may have lost out"". 
	Ross McEwan, RBS and NatWest Chief Executive, said in response to the penalty: ""Taking out a mortgage is one of the biggest moments in our lives, and our customers have every right to expect the very best service when making this decision. 
	""It is clear that in the past the bank just didn’t get this right, this was unacceptable and should never have happened. 
	""We have worked hard to put things right. When I joined the bank we completely overhauled our processes, and took all our mortgage advisers off the front line for an extensive period of time to get the training required. 
	""As a result we are now helping more customers than ever before to buy their new home, providing them with the very best support and advice when taking out their mortgage. 
	""Today’s notice shows that we still have challenges to face, but we are determined to take the steps needed to earn back our customers’ trust."" 
	Last month, Mr McEwan and Group chairman Sir Philip Hampton identified ongoing litigation risks as among the most significant threats to RBS’s continuing recovery, which saw it bring forward its half-year results announcement because the underlying figures were better than the City had been expecting. 
	A settlement with the FCA’s enforcement division over an IT systems failure in 2012 is expected within months, while huge fines for manipulating foreign exchange markets could hit RBS and other banks before the end of the year."
2014-08-27,Salmond Wins With 'Debt Is Yours' Threat,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140827110635/http://news.sky.com/story/1324618/salmond-wins-with-debt-is-yours-threat,"By Faisal Islam, Political Editor Finally, Alex Salmond delivered to the hype in the television debate with Alistair Darling on Scottish independence. 
	The surroundings in Glasgow were grand, next door to the Commonwealth Games bowling green, but this was more of a blood sport. 
	The innovative ramble in to the centre of the stage. The bulldozing of plausible and legitimate concerns about his lack of a currency plan. 
	The blitzing of Mr Darling's attempt to reuse lines from the first debate. And the clear message shouted from the rooftops: Darling is a Tory Trojan horse. 
	On food banks, on the bedroom tax, on Trident, and NHS ""privatisation"", Mr Salmond painted the leader of Better Together as an enabler of centre-right control over centre-left Scotland. 
	Happily for the First Minister, a rather high number in the audience seemed to share in this vitriol, launching highly personalised attacks on Mr Darling. 
	Voting ""Yes"" is the only way to protect Scotland, was Salmond's sell. Mr Salmond critiqued the No campaign's so-called ""project Fear"" a fortnight ago. On Monday night he doubled up on his own version, Project Feartie, perhaps. 
	The debate was brutal. Mr Darling was accused by an audience member of essentially shaming Nye Bevan's legacy in creating the NHS. 
	He was also ""accused"" of privatising the Post Office (untrue). Mr Salmond jabbed his finger at Mr Darling as he blamed him for the bedroom tax (which he and the Labour party will rescind). 
	And he also tried to make a huge play of Darling admitting that Scotland could use the pound unilaterally (the ""Panama"" option). (This is true, but Scottish banks would lose access to central bank funding, so goodbye RBS HQ). 
	But, for me, the really big development, was the candid, transparent use of threat by Mr Salmond over currency union. 
	No currency union, means no share of assets, which means ""the debt is yours"". The First Minister said this repeatedly and clearly. This is high wire stuff with implications for the banking system. 
	More than that, it suggests that a yes vote will lead to a messy divorce, not an amicable split. 
	And that Yes vote was made a little bit more likely or rather, less unlikely. Indeed the ICM/Guardian exit poll had a thumping win for the First Minister. 
	We are in for an interesting few weeks."
2014-08-27,'Loud And Shouty': Referendum Debate Reaction,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140827110635/http://news.sky.com/story/1324629/loud-and-shouty-referendum-debate-reaction,"By Sophy Ridge, Political Correspondent Alistair Darling and Alex Salmond's second debate was even louder and shoutier than the first. This is how Twitter reacted. 
1. The first controversy wasn't about currency or oil - it was Alex Salmond's decision to walk away from the lectern. 
	@Nottstractor: ""Don't like the way Alex Salmond keeps leaving his lectern trying to be all folksy."" 
	‏@ChrisSibthorpe: ""I don't like the random wandering from the lectern. Looks bad. #indyref"" 
2. Twitter was also not impressed by the two men talking over each other. 
	@jimwaterson: ""murble durdle currency I'M ASKING YOU A QUESTION shouty shouty shooty shoot shhh QUOTE FROM THINK TANK mumble shouty shout shout #indyref"" 
	Most people seemed to think that was a fairly accurate summary of the debate. 
3. By the end of the cross examination section, this was the general verdict. 
	‏@VictoriaPeckham: ""I'm getting a McHeadache."" 
4. The Yes Campaign got very excited by Alistair Darling apparently backing Scotland using the pound. 
	@NicolaSturgeon: ""Alistair Darling - 'Of course we can use the £' #bbcindyref"" 
	He then went on to say that it would be a bad idea. But for some reason the Yes campaign couldn't fit that into 140 characters. 
5. The Twitter consensus was that Alex Salmond put in a much better performance than last time. 
	@timglanfield: Salmond's body language is extraordinarly cool. This is winning behaviour. Darling is getting rattled... 
6. But No campaigners are convinced his shouty manner will go down badly with undecided groups. 
	@blairmcdougall: ""Have sat in a *lot* of focus groups with undecided women voters over last 2 years. They cannot stomach shouty Salmond. #bbcindyref"" 
7. In short, people who back independence thought they won, while those who back the union claimed a victory for themselves. 
	@DanHannanMEP: ""Everyone on Twitter: 'Another brilliant point by my guy. The other guy is a total bampot!' #indyref"" 
	Hurrah! As you were."
2014-08-27,'Dreadful' Referendum Clash Turns Off Voters,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140827110635/http://news.sky.com/story/1324634/dreadful-referendum-clash-turns-off-voters,"By James Matthews, Scotland Correspondent The verdict was fairly unanimous in the Glasgow tenement where I watched the Salmond v Darling debate - this politicians' shouting match didn't speak to real people. 
	The residents of Lauderdale Gardens in Glasgow's West End thought both men lost through a failure to deliver clarity on the important issues.  
	In an unedifying spectacle, both seemed on a mission to destroy, not inform. 
	David Mullane, a retailer, sat down to watch the TV debate with an open mind.  
	He is contemplating a Yes vote in the referendum but was unconvinced by anything he saw on television. 
	He told Sky News: ""I didn't learn anything at all and I got so annoyed during the cross-examination that I very nearly pressed the off button. Dreadful."" 
	Writer Carmen Reid, a No voter, was similarly unimpressed.  
	She said: ""I didn't enjoy that debate at all, I thought it was really old-school 'which politician can shout the loudest'. 
	""I thought Alex Salmond in particular was very hectoring, very bullying. I don't really feel that's what we wanted. 
	""If anything I liked him less by the end of the debate than I did before."" 
	Tom Quinn, a businessman, is intending to vote No. 
	He told Sky News: ""I thought Darling's arguments were stronger, Salmond is obviously a very strident, bar room debater; you get what you get from him. 
	""He probably did better than he did the last time because he was probably better prepared and he knew what he was going to get. 
	""But he played to the crowd and what he said didn't really add up."" 
	As an exercise in political point-scoring, the event might have served its purpose. 
	As a viewing spectacle, it seems clear it was a switch-off.  
	For both men, the late opportunity to sell the message to the voters sold them short."
2014-08-27,How Far Will Boris's Political Magic Take Him?,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140827110635/http://news.sky.com/story/1325057/how-far-will-boriss-political-magic-take-him,"A Londoner who described himself as politically centre-left said this to me recently: ""I think the best political solution for me would be Boris in charge of the Labour party."" 
	I smiled as I pointed out that to his most ardent admirers Boris is not just a Tory. To them, he is an uber-Tory. The ultimate Tory. 
	Yet the sentiment expressed by the man is one that I’m sure is shared by others. And the reason for it is 'the Boris effect'. 
	That is the political magic that propelled a deeply Conservative, Eton and Oxford-educated man with Bullingdon club credentials (and very floppy blond hair) to win over a Labour leaning city not once but twice. 
	Londoners lapped up Boris despite his Tory views, his multiple affairs and regular gaffes (remember his inadvertent fall chest deep into a river?). 
	Why? Because Boris (who else would we describe by just their first name?) comes across as one of the most authentic politicians that there is. 
	He has a personable, amusing manner that voters like. And he has the ability to reach across the political spectrum in a way that few others can emulate. 
	For the Prime Minister it is both a blessing and a curse that the London Mayor is on his way back to Westminster. 
	After all, David Cameron would like a bit of 'the Boris effect' to boost his 2015 chances. 
	That is why he has welcomed back his old-school chum, arguing he wants all the star players on his election pitch. 
	He knows that by name recognition alone Mr Johnson will help boost the Tories. 
	But Mr Cameron will be looking warily over his shoulder too and wondering about the motives that are driving his colleague back to Parliament. 
	He knows that Boris has his eyes on the ultimate goal - the party leadership. And he won't have missed the polls that show how that could boost the Conservatives' overall appeal. 
	Mr Cameron knows that grassroots supporters are sore that he missed out on a majority last time. 
	If he falls short again, they will be calling for a new star player to take over the captaincy."
2014-08-27,Terror-Related Travel Arrests Increase Fivefold,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140827110635/http://news.sky.com/story/1325000/terror-related-travel-arrests-increase-fivefold,"There has been a fivefold increase in UK nationals arrested for travelling to Syria or Iraq to engage in terrorist activities, according to Scotland Yard. 
	Police said 69 suspected extremists have been arrested so far this year who planned to travel to Syria or fund terrorism there. 
	Assistant Chief Constable Mark Rowley, of the Metropolitan Police, appealed to family members of potential UK terrorists to come forward and said nearly half of would-be extremists identified as part of the Syria investigations were not previously classed as dangerous. 
	""The biggest growth in Syrian-related investigations has occurred in London and the West Midlands,"" he said. 
	""The growth of dangerous individuals poses challenges for policing, especially when nearly half of Syria travellers of concern were not known as terrorist risks previously. 
	""Hence, we appeal to the public to help identify for us aspiring terrorists - they may be about to travel abroad, have just returned or be showing signs of becoming radicalised."" 
	Mr Rowley added that seizures of cash which people had been trying to take out of the country to fund Syria-related terror activity have also doubled. 
	Investigators are attempting to get hundreds of pieces of terror-related content linked to Syria removed from websites including YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. 
	Mr Rowley said police in the UK are trying to prevent hate crimes that could be influenced by events abroad, including anti-Semitic offences related to the Gaza conflict. 
	He added: ""There is a lot at stake. 
	""In addition to the public assistance in identifying potential terrorists, we all need community and religious leaders to continue to speak out against warped narratives and we need everyone to ensure that public debate does not give oxygen to the terrorists by giving them the publicity they seek."" 
	An estimated 500 Britons have travelled to Syria and Iraq to fight alongside extremists, half of whom are thought to be from London."
2014-08-27,Boris Johnson To Stand As MP In West London,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140827110635/http://news.sky.com/story/1324944/boris-johnson-to-stand-as-mp-in-west-london,"Boris Johnson hopes to stand in the west London seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip at next year's General Election. 
	Mr Johnson announced earlier this month he would ""in all probability… try to find somewhere to stand in 2015"" - and on Tuesday he submitted his application 48 hours before the deadline. 
	The constituency is available because Conservative MP John Randall is standing down. 
	The local party will pick its candidate from up to 100 hopefuls on September 12. 
	Mr Johnson said he hoped to ""make his case"" that he was the best person to represent the constituency. 
	""I'm sure there will be plenty of excellent candidates and I hope very much to make my case to the association,"" he told the Evening Standard. 
	Prime Minister David Cameron was among the first to welcome news of Mr Johnson's candidacy when it emerged on August 6. 
	He tweeted: ""Great news that Boris plans to stand at next year's general election - I've always said I want my star players on the pitch."" 
	There has been speculation Mr Johnson will eventually challenge for the Tory leadership. 
	Sky's Political Correspondent Anushka Asthana said: ""David Cameron has welcomed him and thinks he could help the Conservatives win the 2015 General Election, but he might be a little worried about what happens after that."" 
	Uxbridge and South Ruislip had a Conservative majority of more than 11,000 at the last election. 
	Mr Johnson has said that if he is elected to the Commons next May he will still serve out his term as Mayor, which ends in 2016. 
	The constituency's Labour candidate, Chris Summers, has claimed the high-profile Tory could face a backlash there because of his proposals to close the nearby Heathrow Airport and replace it with a new one in the Thames Estuary. 
	Back Heathrow's campaign co-ordinator Rob Gray said: ""Boris Johnson's selfish plan to stand in the same borough as Heathrow is a slap in the face to tens of thousands of people in west London. 
	""These people rely on Britain's hub airport and the Mayor wants to close it which would result in more than 100,000 people losing their jobs, including many in Uxbridge and South Ruislip."" 
	Mr Johnson was MP for Henley between 2001 and 2008 and served in the shadow cabinet. 
	News of his application comes on a day when Nigel Farage will battle with other UKIP members hoping to stand as an MP in the South Thanet constituency."

	The singer, dressed in black, walked on stage with a procession of backing dancers to open the first of 22 shows at the west London venue with a performance of Lily. 
	The Before The Dawn shows see the 56-year-old return to the venue where she effectively quit touring after just six weeks on the road in 1979 and have been described as the ""musical event of the decade"". 
	During the interval, one fan told Sky News: ""It's absolutely electric, it's incredible. 
	""I have waited my whole life for this and she hasn't disappointed at all. It's just amazing."" 
	Another said: ""It's actually not like anything I've seen before, it is really incredible. I don't want to give anything away because she'll probably hate me, but it's phenomenal."" 
	In the weeks before the show, Bush asked fans not to take pictures or videos on their phones during the performance. 
	The more than 80,000 tickets for the run were sold out in less than 15 minutes back in March and the excitement leading up to the first show has seemed set to propel all nine of her studio albums and two compilations into the top 100. 
	Sales figures from the Official Charts Company showed her greatest hits collection The Whole Story, which hit number one on its release in 1986, is currently number eight, followed by 1985's Hounds Of Love at number 14. 
	Her 2011 collection 50 Words For Snow and her 1978 debut The Kick Inside are at 32 and 33 respectively and 1989's The Sensual World is at Number 41. 
	Although there have been numerous theories about her absence from the stage in the 35 years since her only tour, she explained in a rare interview with Mojo magazine in 2011 why she had not returned. 
	""It was enormously enjoyable. But physically it was absolutely exhausting,"" she said. 
	Bush burst onto the scene in 1978 at the age of 19, when her debut single ""Wuthering Heights"" went to the top of Britain's singles chart and stayed there for four weeks. 
	Artists as diverse as Tupac Shakur, Sex Pistol Johnny Rotten, Bjork and Coldplay have all cited Bush as an influence."
2014-08-27,Darling Under Pressure After 'Losing' Debate,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140827110635/http://news.sky.com/story/1324929/darling-under-pressure-after-losing-debate,"Alistair Darling insists the momentum is still with the 'No' campaign despite claims by his rival that he ""muffed"" the arguments in Monday night's final Scottish independence TV debate. 
	As the first postal ballot papers were sent out ahead of the referendum on September 18, polls suggest the  'Yes' campaign leader Alex Salmond came out on top in front of the TV cameras. 
	A key aspect of the debate was currency - with former Chancellor Mr Darling, who is fronting the Better Together campaign, admitting no one could stop Scotland using the pound. 
	Mr Salmond also outlined three 'plan Bs'. 
	Speaking to Sky News on Tuesday, Scotland's First Minister said the 'No' campaign's ""bluff had been called"" over use of the pound. 
	""He muffed his chance,"" said Mr Salmond. 
	""We explained the currency options for Scotland - the three plan Bs, if you like. 
	""But we explained why the currency union between Scotland and England is what we're asking for a mandate for."" 
	However, Mr Darling told Sky News the 'Yes' side remained ""vague"" on currency and had to ""make up their minds"". 
	""TV debates are important but the real debates are going on in people's homes,"" he said. ""Increasingly, people are making up their minds and saying 'no' to the risks of independence. 
	""They're concerned that after three hours of prime time TV we still haven't had answers to basic questions about currency. 
	""The postal votes are going out and this is perhaps the biggest decision people will make in their lifetime - and he (Mr Salmond) still can't answer basic questions."" 
	Sky's Political Editor Faisal Islam says that whether people believe Mr Salmond on currency could decide the outcome of the referendum. 
	""Mr Salmond views the currency debate as over and if that's right and people have heard enough, just maybe he can creep back up the vote share and reduce the 'No' lead. 
	""If Mr Darling is right, and currency is still impacting people on the doorstep, then surely 'No' will win."" 
	There were also angry exchanges over North Sea oil, the NHS and welfare during the 90-minute debate, which was hosted by the BBC in front of an audience of 200 at Glasgow's Kelvingrove Museum and Art Gallery. 
	Voters have to register to cast postal ballots by September 3, meaning some could cast their votes within days. 
	After the debate, a Sky News poll carried out on Twitter saw more than 2,000 retweets for a Salmond win, compared to under 500 claiming Darling had topped the debate. 
	A Guardian/ICM poll gave the debate to Mr Salmond with 71% of the vote. 
	Mr Darling was widely judged to have won the first. 
	A poll of polls, carried out by Sky News before the debate, put 39% in favour of Scottish independence, with 50% against and another 11% undecided."

	They tied up a member of staff at the Dean Street Townhouse in Soho before making off with cash and mobile phones. 
	Police were called to the four-storey boutique hotel at 3.05am after the two men burst in and demanded money. 
	No shots were fired and no one was injured, although staff were threatened and one man was treated for shock. 
	The two robbers were said to have eastern European accents and were wearing white hoodies. 
	Detective Superintendent Jess Ruddell, of the Metropolitan Police, said hotel staff had been left ""very shaken"" by the raid and urged witnesses to contact police. 
	She said: ""This is a very serious incident and we are working around the clock to identify those responsible. 
	""It was a very frightening experience for staff, who were threatened with a long-barrelled weapon and were very shaken."" 
	A Soho House spokesman said: ""We can confirm that an incident took place in the lobby area of the Dean Street Townhouse in the early hours of this morning. 
	""Two male members of staff were on duty and no one was hurt in the incident. The matter is currently being investigated by the Metropolitan Police.""

	Words such as Google, internet, Facebook and iPhone have taken over from fetch, pussycat and fortnight as the world wide web plays an increasingly important part in our lives. 
	Marvellous is also being used less frequently and has been replaced by the word awesome, reflecting the American influence on the way British people speak. 
	The pilot list for the Spoken British National Corpus 2014 project - put together by Lancaster University and Cambridge University Press - looks at conversation starting from the early 1990s up to the present day and is in its early stages. 
	Language expert Professor Tony McEnery, from Lancaster University, said: ""These very early findings suggest the things that are most important to British society are indeed reflected in the amount we talk about them. 
	""New technologies like Facebook have really captured our attention, to the extent that, if we're not using it, we're probably talking about it. 
	""The rise of 'awesome' seems to provide evidence of American English's influence on British speakers."" 
	The project is currently analysing around 200 modern conversations but is appealing for thousands more so that it can compare them with those from 20-plus years ago. 
	Researchers are calling for people to send them MP3 files of their everyday, informal conversations in exchange for a small payment to help them delve deeper into spoken language. 
	The technological changes in society have clearly had a huge impact on society, with email, smartphone and website also among the top 10 on the list. 
	And the speed of change within that terminology is also evident. 
	Walkman, a trendy word of the 1990s, is now on the list of words showing the biggest decline in usage. 
	The project also appears to give a fascinating insight into social habits too. 
	Marmalade is a word that has fallen out of use - perhaps showing how breakfast itself is a changing meal - or that today's young may no longer like the bitter-tasting jam."

	The UKIP leader was picked ahead of three other shortlisted candidates. 
	Local officials voted after questioning the four in hustings at Odd Fellows Hall in Ramsgate, Kent. 
	Mr Farage said afterwards: ""We can't for one moment afford to be complacent because we swept the board in 2013 and we swept the board here in 2014. 
	""We did and that was magnificent. But don't think that the heavy artillery from the Conservative and Labour parties will not be fired on this constituency. 
	""They will, they will, they will try very, very hard. They don't want UKIP breaking through into Parliament and they most certainly do not want me breaking through into Parliament. 
	""Somebody said I'm David Cameron's worst nightmare. Well, that's not good enough. I want to be Ed Miliband's worst nightmare too."" 
	Mr Farage hopes to win the seat held by Conservative Laura Sandys, who took South Thanet with a majority of 7,617 in 2010. 
	He faces competition from Craig MacKinlay, the former UKIP leader chosen to stand for the Tories. 
	Ms Sandys is standing down after one term because of ""a wide range of family demands"". 
	Mr Farage stood in South Thanet in 2005, and finished fourth with 2,079 votes, a 5% share. 
	It is one of 12 seats UKIP are planning to target heavily for the 2015 General Election, according to the party's internal polling seen by Sky News. 
	Most of the seats are held by Conservatives and tend to be situated across the southern half of England. 
	Mr Farage admitted he could be replaced as UKIP leader if the party failed to win any seats at all. 
	""In all of life if you succeed you get the laurels and the champagne and if you fail you get booted out. That applies to Ed Miliband, to David Cameron, to Nick Clegg and to me,"" he said.

	The data watchdog issued the punishment after the storage device was lost at HMP Erlestoke prison in Wiltshire in May last year. 
	The drive was not encrypted and contained sensitive and confidential information about 2,935 prisoners. 
	Details such as links to organised crime, health information and drug use was contained on the drive, along with details of victims and visitors. 
	An investigation by the Information Commissioner’s Office found data was routinely being handled without encryption at all 75 prisons in England and Wales. 
	The loss of the Wiltshire hard drive followed a similar case in October 2011, when the ICO was told of the loss of another unencrypted hard drive containing the details of 16,000 inmates at HMP High Down in Surrey. 
	In response to the Surrey incident, the Prison Service provided new hard drives to all prisons. 
	But the ICO found the Prison Service did not realise the encryption option on the new hard drives needed to be turned on to work correctly. 
	This meant highly sensitive information was insecurely handled for more than a year. 
	ICO head of enforcement Stephen Eckersley said: ""The fact that a government department with security oversight for prisons can supply equipment to 75 prisons throughout England and Wales without properly understanding, let alone telling them, how to use it beggars belief. 
	""The result was that highly sensitive information about prisoners and vulnerable members of the public, including victims, was insecurely handled for over a year."" 
	He added: ""We hope this penalty sends a clear message that organisations must not only have the right equipment available to keep people's information secure, but must understand how to use it."""
2014-08-27,Stop And Search Code Of Conduct Lauched,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140827110635/http://news.sky.com/story/1324729/stop-and-search-code-of-conduct-lauched,"By Anushka Asthana, Political Correspondent Police forces across the country will today sign up to a crackdown on the misuse of stop and search powers that have caused tension between officers and the black community. 
	A new voluntary code will mean the outcome of each stop will be recorded to measure how many lead to an arrest. 
	There will also be tougher rules around the controversial ""section 60"" stops where there are no grounds for suspicion. 
	Under the plans these powers will require higher authorisation - from a chief police officer - and will be limited to 15-hour periods, down from 24. 
	They will also have to believe that violence ""will"" occur without the measure, while before it was only if more junior officers thought it might occur. 
	Some 24 police forces across England and Wales will start implementing the code, which has been brought in by Home Secretary Theresa May, immediately. By November all 43 forces will have signed up. 
	""Nobody wins when stop and search is misused,"" said Mrs May. ""It can be an enormous waste of police time and damage the relationship between the public and police. 
	""I am delighted that all 43 police forces have signed up to the Best Use of Stop and Search scheme. It will increase transparency, give us a better understanding of how stop and search is actually being used and help local communities hold the police to account for their use of the powers. 
	""I hope it will also go a long way to building public confidence and forging an important link between communities and the police."" 
	Mrs May believes the way the powers have been used is unfair to young, black men in particular. They are six times more likely to be stopped overall, but this rises to 29 times in some areas. 
	The Equality and Human Rights Commission has called the figure ""stubbornly"" high. 
	The Met police, one of the first to sign up to the code, admitted they used Section 60 powers this weekend at the Notting Hill Carnival. 
	They also brought in Section 60AA powers - through which people can be asked to remove disguises. The force said it was in ""response to incidents of violence and intelligence received"". 
	The country-wide reforms are being led by black police inspector Nick Glynn, of Leicestershire force, who said he has been stopped and searched about 30 times when off duty. 
	Chief Executive of the College of Policing, Chief Constable Alex Marshall, added: ""Stop and search powers are necessary to help us tackle crime and keep people safe but it is clear they are being misused too often. This can leave resentment in our communities and hinder our ability to prevent crime."""
2014-08-27,Clegg: No Law Needed To Stop UK Jihadists,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140827110635/http://news.sky.com/story/1324781/clegg-no-law-needed-to-stop-uk-jihadists,"Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has rejected calls for tougher measures to combat the threat of British jihadists returning from Iraq and Syria. 
	Boris Johnson became the latest voice to demand that suspected Islamic State (IS) militants returning to the UK are stripped of their citizenship. 
	His comments come as it is believed that a British fighter dubbed 'Jihadi John' was responsible for the beheading of US journalist James Foley. 
	The London Mayor also wants a new law that would see anyone travelling to Syria or Iraq ""without good reason"" arrested. 
	However, Mr Clegg said laws were already in place to keep the streets of Britain safe. 
	He said: ""I sometimes wish it was as simple as Boris Johnson implies: all we need to do is pass a law and everything will be well. 
	""They (IS militants) shouldn't be able to come back and do harm on the streets of British towns, villages and cities, and that is now our number one priority 
	""It's what the police, the authorities and security services are working flat out on; I have huge confidence in the outstanding work they do. 
	""With the greatest respect to Boris Johnson, I will listen to what they tell me they need rather than what he says. 
	""We actually have a number of measures already on the statute book which allow us to keep a very close eye on those people who aren't in prison, aren't sentenced, but nonetheless are perceived to be a threat to the United Kingdom."" 
	Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond has warned that IS fighters will ""seek to strike us on British soil"" if they are not stopped. 
	Mr Johnson said doing nothing would mean a ""tide of terror will eventually lap at our own front door"". 
	But former attorney general Dominic Grieve said a suggestion that those travelling to Iraq and Syria should be presumed guilty was ""draconian""."
