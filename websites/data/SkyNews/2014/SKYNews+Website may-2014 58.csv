2014-05-29,Lord Rennard Says Sorry To 'Harassment' Women,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140529200554/http://news.sky.com/story/1271625/lord-rennard-says-sorry-to-harassment-women,"Former Liberal Democrat peer Lord Rennard has apologised to four women who accused him of ""harassment"". 
	The ex-chief executive of the party had previously refused to say sorry having maintained his innocence ever since allegations were made that he had behaved ""inappropriately"". 
	Now it has emerged he has issued an apology in a letter sent to Liberal Democrat HQ. 
	The letter says: ""Lord Rennard wishes to achieve closure of the contentious issues that have been in the public domain for the last fourteen months by expressing his apologies to Susan Gaszczak, Alison Goldsworthy, Bridget Harris and Alison Smith. 
	""Lord Rennard personally accepts the full report of Alistair Webster QC as given to him on March 7th in its entirety. 
	""He would therefore like to apologise sincerely for any such intrusion and assure them that this would have been inadvertent. 
	""He hereby expresses his regret for any harm or embarrassment caused to them or anything which made them feel uncomfortable. 
	""Lord Rennard wishes to make it absolutely clear that it was never his intention to cause distress or concern to them by anything that he ever said or did."" 
	Lord Rennard's legal adviser Lord Carlile told Sky's Murnaghan programme in January Lord Rennard was being ""lined up against a wall"" and he should not apologise given no allegations against him had been proven. 
	Police investigated claims that Lord Rennard sexually harassed female party activists last year, but decided not to press charges. 
	But an internal inquiry carried out by Alistair Webster QC found there was broadly credible evidence of ""behaviour which violated the personal space and autonomy of the complainants"". 
	Lord Rennard was suspended from the party, but remains a Lord, as a result of the allegations against him. 
	One of the women who made the allegations, Bridget Harris, a former adviser to Nick Clegg who resigned from the Lib Dems over the party's failure to act, told Sky News: ""I welcome it but I wish he'd done it 15 months ago, then it would have saved us all a huge amount of pain and hassle. 
	""What's really important here is that he's acknowledged responsibility for what he's doing and a stronger message is that we were not lying.""  
	Tonight, a spokesperson for Lord Rennard said that the apology speaks for itself. 
	A Liberal Democrat spokesperson said: ""An appeal has been submitted by three of the original complainants against the outcome of Alistair Webster's investigation. 
	""Separately, an appeal has been submitted by Lord Rennard against the disciplinary process for bringing the party into disrepute by his failure to apologise, and his conduct after the publication of Webster's conclusions. 
	""Both appeals will be considered by the English Appeals Panel in accordance with the rules of the party. We cannot comment further on any aspect of that process while it is ongoing."""
2014-05-29,Stephen Sutton Vigil As Donations Top £4m,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140529200554/http://news.sky.com/story/1271529/stephen-sutton-vigil-as-donations-top-4m,"The appeal by teenage cancer fund-raiser Stephen Sutton has passed £4m as tens of thousands of people are expected to attend his vigil later. 
	The 19-year-old will never be forgotten because of the ""incredible impact"" he had on the lives of young people with cancer, said Teenage Cancer Trust - the charity he raised money for. 
	A two-day vigil begins this evening at Lichfield Cathedral, Staffordshire, to allow friends and well-wishers to pay their respects to the teenager whose courage facing terminal cancer inspired millions across the world. 
	Stephen originally started the charity drive on his justgiving.com page, but donations continued to pour in from people touched by his example. 
	He died on May 14 after succumbing to multiple tumours. 
	Teenage Cancer Trust's chief executive Siobhan Dunn said: ""Stephen's an extraordinary young man who has had the most incredible impact on the lives of so many young people with cancer. 
	""I think it's really important there's a public celebration of Stephen's life and I think that's exactly what he would have wanted. 
	""He was looking for us to put the fun into his funeral so hopefully we're going to do that."" 
	Stephen's mother Jane Sutton has called for people not to wear black to the vigil, but to ""do something to make others happy"". 
	Yellow ribbons have begun to appear around Stephen's home town of Burntwood and other towns in Staffordshire, because of its association with summer - Stephen's favourite season. 
	Before his death, he said: ""I don't see the point in measuring life in terms of time anymore. I'd rather measure life in terms of making a difference."" 
	It is estimated up to 40,000 people may attend his vigil."
2014-05-29,Hillsborough Jury Shown 1981 Crush Footage,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140529200554/http://news.sky.com/story/1271353/hillsborough-jury-shown-1981-crush-footage,"By Becky Johnson, Sky News Correspondent Footage of a near-fatal crush at the Hillsborough stadium years before the 1989 disaster has been shown at the inquests into the deaths of 96 football fans. 
	The jury was told 38 fans were injured during a similar crush at the 1981 FA Cup semi-final between Tottenham Hotspur and Wolverhampton Wanderers. 
	On that occasion, the Tottenham fans were allocated the Leppings Lane terrace at the stadium, the same stand allocated to Liverpool fans in 1989. 
	The jury was told that in 1981, there was congestion at the Leppings Lane turnstiles, resulting in a gate being opened to allow fans into the ground. 
	The inquest heard the crush occurred as the crowd on the terraces surged forward when Spurs scored four minutes into the match. 
	The game was televised and the footage shown to the court included clips where stands can be seen behind the action on the pitch. 
	Six minutes into the game, fans are filmed climbing over the fence between the crowded stands and the pitch and sitting down behind the goal. 
	By the 11th minute, dozens of fans were sitting on the pitch with more still climbing the fence. 
	Two minutes later, St John Ambulance workers are seen carrying a stretcher along the sideline to help a spectator. 
	Half an hour into the game, so many fans had managed to escape the crush on the terraces they were lining the pitch behind the western goal and in front of the south stand. 
	At half-time, spectators ran across the pitch. 
	The jury was told perimeter fences were opened, allowing between 100 and 250 fans to leave the crowded terrace. 
	The inquest heard that following the near-tragedy, Hillsborough was not used for FA Cup semi-finals until 1987. 
	The jury was told that after 1981, consideration was given to whether the capacity for the stand, stated on the ground's safety certificate as 10,100, was too high. 
	Eight years later in a crush on the same terrace, after the same gate was opened to relieve congestion at the Leppings Lane turnstiles, 96 Liverpool fans died. 
	The inquests continue."
2014-05-29,Hospital Accused Of 'Abandoning' Dying Mother,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140529200554/http://news.sky.com/story/1271469/hospital-accused-of-abandoning-dying-mother,"The family of a 45-year-old mother have released a shocking image which they say shows her curled up in agony after she was ""abandoned"" by medics at a hospital linked to a series of scandals. 
	Margaret Lamberty's family say they plan to sue the University Hospital of North Staffordshire, alleging that doctors and nurses failed to diagnose her treatable condition and then did not respond to her calls for help. 
	The grandmother-of-eight died of multiple organ failure triggered by blood clots in her bowel on April 30 after collapsing at her home in Stoke-on-Trent. 
	Her daughter Laura, 28, said the family repeatedly warned doctors Mrs Lamberty had a history of blood clots when she was admitted to the hospital with chronic stomach pains three days earlier. 
	Laura said doctors overlooked their warnings and failed to conduct the correct tests. 
	""My mum was failed by the doctors and the nurses. She was abandoned in a side room while she died in agonising pain,"" Laura said. 
	""It was horrific for her and the worst thing I have ever had to see. We told the doctors over and over again she suffered from blood clots but they simply ignored us. 
	""We are determined to get justice for mum and find out the truth about what happened. No one should go through what she did."" 
	Her family claim that in the days before her death she was left in blood-stained sheets for 24 hours and forced to wait half an hour for a nurse after buzzing for help. 
	Laura, from Chell Heath, Stoke-on-Trent, said she took the pictures of her mother lying on the hospital floor to show doctors how much pain she was in. 
	She said: ""Before she was admitted to hospital, mum was fit and healthy. 
	""But then she was cradling her stomach in a ball on the floor, she was in so much pain. She has been taken from us and we want to know why. 
	""I just wish the doctors would have taken her seriously and then maybe she would still be here."" 
	The mother-of-four's death is the latest in a series of scandals to hit the £400m hospital. 
	Last November 81-year-old Lillian Baddeley's family alleged she died after catching four superbugs at the hospital. 
	Several months earlier an inquest heard how two premature babies died due to a ""breakdown in hand hygiene"" at the hospital. 
	According to NHS whistleblower Julie Bailey, Mrs Lamberty's case is not unique in the UK medical system.  
	Mrs Bailey, who has set up campaign group Cure The NHS, said: ""Time and time again patients are not being listened to. 
	""Very often patients, and their families, know what is wrong with them but medics do not listen to them. 
	""Too many times we see medics dismissing patients concerns and failing to listen to what they are saying. 
	""It is appalling that this family felt so desperate they were forced to take a picture of their mother in such terrible pain."" 
	Mrs Lamberty's family have now submitted a letter of complaint to the hospital 
	A spokesman for the University Hospital of North Staffordshire NHS Trust told Sky News: ""The Trust attempted to contact the family of Mrs Lamberty earlier this month. We recently received correspondence from Mrs Lamberty’s family and we will again be attempting to contact them to discuss their concerns. 
	""The Trust would like to offer its sincere condolences to Mrs Lamberty’s family."""
2014-05-29,Will And Kate's 'Dram' Scotches Baby Rumours,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140529200554/http://news.sky.com/story/1271510/will-and-kates-dram-scotches-baby-rumours,"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been drinking whisky while on a visit to Scotland – possibly scotching rumours the Duchess might be pregnant. 
	Kate and William sampled a 'dram' of Scotland's national drink while on a tour of the Glenturret distillery, just outside Crieff, Perthshire. 
	The tour was part of their visit to the Strathearn area of central Scotland. 
	The couple were appointed the Earl and Countess Strathearn by the Queen after they were married. 
	At the distillery, they were greeted by a bagpiper and crowds waving flags before being shown round. 
	When they reached the whisky bar, master blender Gordon Motion talked them through the different brands. 
	William chose the Alpha Black first, and commented: ""That's pretty good."" 
	Kate sipped from a glass of Snow Goose – said to have a lighter flavour and be popular with women - which she said was ""very nice"" and suggested that William try ""the girly one"". 
	The couple were also offered a glass of cask strength Glenturret single malt which prompted the Prince to say ""Blimey, it's got a bit of a kick to it,"" while Kate said it was delicious. 
	It came after the couple's recent trip to Australia and New Zealand when Kate appeared to quash speculation that she may be expecting a second child by telling wine-makers how she was enjoying being able to drink again after the birth of Prince George. 
	The Duchess wore a coral and red striped coat by Scottish designer Jonathan Saunders and a dress by Goat. 
	The outfit was topped off with beige heels, a matching clutch bag and a celtic brooch given to her as a wedding present. 
	General manager Stuart Cassells presented the couple with a bottle of whisky, personalised with the label ""The Famous Streathearns"". 
	He also gave them a cuddly grouse toy for their son, saying: ""We didn't want to leave George out."" 
	Established as a single malt distillery in 1775, Glenturret is also blended with other grains and malt whiskies to create The Famous Grouse, one of the world's top five whiskies. 
	During their tour, the couple officially opened the newly-revamped Famous Grouse Experience visitor attraction. 
	Mr Cassells said: ""They said they liked whisky, both Prince William and Kate. 
	""We were quite surprised at how many different whiskies they tried. The last whisky they tried was at 57% cask strength."" 
	After bottling their own whisky, the couple attended a civic reception with people from Perthshire, invited for their work in the community. 
	They had begun the day with a visit to Strathearn Community Campus where they were greeted by crowds of excited locals waving Saltires and Union flags. 
	While there, the Duke chatted to the crew of Scotland's Charity Air Ambulance (SCAA). 
	The encounter came days after reports suggested the Duke is considering taking a pilot's role with the East Anglian Air Ambulance service. 
	John Pritchard, 46, lead paramedic with the SCAA, said: ""He never said a thing about it, but I would certainly welcome him on to the team."" 
	Meanwhile, Prince Harry visited the Suffolk Show and a young people's centre in Ipswich."
2014-05-29,Elephant Uses Dropped Phone To Take 'Selfie',https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140529200554/http://news.sky.com/story/1271572/elephant-uses-dropped-phone-to-take-selfie,"A man who dropped his phone while touring a wildlife park was surprised when he recovered it to find an elephant had used it to take a ""selfie"" picture. 
	Scott Brierley was using the smart phone to take pictures in West Midlands Safari Park in Bewdley when it slipped from his grip. 
	He decided it was too dangerous to get out of the car and retrieve it but staff later went into the elephant enclosure to get it for him. 
	When he looked at the photos stored on the device, he was amazed to find one showing an elephant looking straight at the lens, apparently touching the display with its trunk. 
	Mr Brierley, 23, said: ""I hit my phone on the side of the car door and it fell down on to the grass. 
	""The elephant was all over it. I think he thought it was food. I didn't dare get out the car to get it. I just drove to one of the workers I could see and he went to get it. 
	""I really couldn't believe it when the iPhone came back. 
	""I pressed the centre button to check it was still working and, wow, there it was - me and my friend were in shock! 
	""The elephant had taken two pictures, but the second isn't very good. I have shown everybody the elephant selfie, and they all love it."" 
	When head keeper Andy Plumb was shown the picture he was as surprised as Mr Brierley and recognised it was 22-year-old African elephant Latabe who had taken what the phone's owner thinks is the world's first ""elfie"". 
	Mr Plumb said: ""I saw the young man drop the phone and I waved him on. He started to drive towards us so I went to retrieve it. 
	""Lots of people have dropped their phones at our park but I've never seen anything like this. What a picture! We're very proud of Latabe."""
2014-05-29,'Canoe Man' Ordered To Pay Back Pension Cash,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140529200554/http://news.sky.com/story/1271339/canoe-man-ordered-to-pay-back-pension-cash,"A man convicted of conning insurance companies out of hundreds of thousands of pounds by faking his own death has been ordered to hand over £40,000 from two pensions that have now matured. 
	John Darwin, who was reported missing in a canoe in the North Sea in March 2002, was given the order during a Proceeds of Crime Act hearing at Teesside Crown Court, the same court where the 63-year-old was jailed for fraud in 2008. 
	The pensions were earned from his time as a teacher and a prison officer. 
	A judge previously ordered a repayment of £679,073 but Darwin, who is now unemployed, living in Seaton Carew, near Hartlepool, and claiming benefits, has so far only repaid £122. 
	After the hearing, prosecutor Jolyon Perks said Darwin might face further applications should he come into more money in the future. 
	""We believe it sends a strong signal to those who seek to benefit from their criminal conduct that these orders have teeth,"" he said. 
	""They will be pursued and they will be rigorously enforced. 
	""The Proceeds of Crime Act is intended to be draconian."" 
	Darwin's wife, Anne, from whom he is now divorced, has repaid more than £500,000 under a separate Proceeds of Crime order. 
	She had collected a similar amount in life insurance cash paid out over her husband's alleged death while he hid in their home. 
	The couple's two sons were left believing their father had died. 
	He was reunited with them after walking into a police station in London in December 2007 and claiming he had no recollection of what had happened. 
	His wife, who had run away with him to Panama, pretended she, too, was amazed at his reappearance until a photograph turned up of them posing together after his supposed death. 
	She was later jailed for more than six years for fraud and money laundering."
2014-05-29,Rolf Harris' Daughter 'Smashed Up Paintings',https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140529200554/http://news.sky.com/story/1271425/rolf-harris-daughter-smashed-up-paintings,"By Nick Pisa, Sky News Reporter, at Southwark Crown Court Entertainer Rolf Harris' daughter smashed up his paintings and banged her head against a wall after she found out he had been accused of assaulting a friend of hers, his trial has heard. 
	The 84-year-old, who denies 12 counts of indecent assault, made the revelations in cross-examination as the case approached its third week. 
	He told the trial he only began a physical relationship with the main complainant in the case when she was 18 years old but she claims he abused her when she was just 13. 
	Harris told the jury of six men and six women at Southwark Crown Court about the furious reaction of his daughter, Bindi, when she heard about the abuse allegations. 
	Prosecutor Sasha Wass QC asked him: ""Bindi was beside herself?"" 
	He replied:""I suppose so, yes."" 
	Ms Wass said: ""She (Bindi) was in such a state she was banging her head against a wall."" 
	During a second day of cross-examination, Harris repeatedly denied the allegations against him, describing them as ''lies''. 
	He denied his claim the woman had asked him for £25,000 was an ""attempt to discredit"" her and her family. 
	He also denied trying to ""vilify"" alleged victim Tonya Lee. 
	Ms Lee, who has waived the usual right to anonymity given to alleged sex offence victims, claims Harris touched her when she travelled to Britain from Australia for a tour in 1986. 
	Harris told the court he accused her of making up the allegation because her story ""didn't hold water"". 
	He denied ever meeting Ms Lee and when asked why she would have lied, he said: ""It would only be to support her story. I can't imagine why she would say that but it's all lies."" 
	Harris also dismissed another allegation, made by a woman who claims he groped her as she got an autograph from the star at a community centre in Portsmouth, telling the court he was ""never there"". 
	He said he would not have needed to tour the country to promote his track Two Little Boys because it was an ""instant hit and hardly needed any promotion"". 
	He also said he would not have performed the song unaccompanied. 
	The star told the court: ""She's lying. I wasn't there. She must be making it up."" 
	Harris was asked about another claim, made by a woman who has appeared as a witness, but whose allegations do not relate to a charge, in which he is said to have told her he wanted to be the first person to give her a ""tongue kiss"". 
	He said: ""I would never say that. I hate that expression."" 
	The star also dismissed another allegation by a separate witness who says he groped her and said he had ""no recollection"" of meeting another witness who has told the court he assaulted her in Malta. 
	Harris, of Bray, Berkshire, denies indecently assaulting four women aged between seven or eight years old and 19 years old between 1968 and 1986. 
	The trial continues."
2014-05-29,World Cup: Seven Ways To Predict The Winners,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140529200554/http://news.sky.com/story/1271324/world-cup-seven-ways-to-predict-the-winners,"What do Stephen Hawking, Homer Simpson and weather forecasters have in common? They have all tried to use their specialist skills to predict the outcome of a World Cup. 
	Sky News looks at seven ways you might second guess the outcome of Brazil 2014. (Anyone with Three Lions in their heart should probably look away now.) 
:: The Simpsons 
	In 2005 the hit cartoon correctly predicted the outcome of the Super Bowl - and now they have tried their luck at the World Cup. A one-off special produced by Fox earlier this year featured Homer refereeing a final between Brazil and Germany, with the Germans apparently beating the host nation 2-0. 
:: The mathematical formula 
	Professor Stephen Hawking studied England's performances to come up with an equation that shows the Three Lions are more likely to flourish after short-haul flights when the temperatures are low and the games kick off at a familiar 3pm. 
	The good news is that… No, there is no good news. England face a 5,000-mile flight to a country expecting 30C weather, to play games at 6pm, 4pm and 1pm. There is one straw for Roy Hodgson to clutch: in 2010 German physics lecturer Metin Tolan devised a formula that predicted glory for his countrymen. Happily he was proved 'falsch'. 
:: The animal oracle 
	Perhaps Mr Tolan should have visited the Sea Life Centre in Oberhausen. It was here Paul the Octopus was presented with two boxes, each emblazoned with a nation's flag, during the 2010 World Cup. 
Paul chose the winner in all seven of Germany's matches and also called a Spain win over Holland in the final. A parakeet and a fish named Koi Hodgson are among those who have tried to mimic Paul, but neither have come close to matching his psychic success. 
:: The financial institution 
	Goldman Sachs has been issuing World Cup predictions since 1998 and say the winners can be pinpointed by examining how countries are performing in the global markets. 
	This year they reckon Brazil, Germany, Argentina and Spain will make the semi-finals - and have given England a 1.4% chance of lifting the trophy. Thankfully for Rooney and co, their past predictions have been way off target - guessing none of the semi-finalists in 2002 and just 50% in the last two tournaments. 
:: The weather forecasters 
	Meteorologists predicted World Cup 'El' for England long before Hawking and Goldman Sachs piped up. Climate scientists at the University of Reading have said there is a 60% chance of El Nino conditions in Brazil this summer. This would ""increase the risk of uncomfortably hot and dry conditions"" during the tournament - a blow to European teams used to playing in cooler conditions. 
:: The form book 
	Spain are the reigning champions but, remarkably, no European team has ever won football's greatest prize on South American soil. In fact, on the seven occasions the World Cup has been played in the Americas, either Brazil, Argentina or Uruguay have triumphed. England have never passed the quarter-final stage in those years. 
:: The bookies 
	Brazil has its own version of the 'Boris Bike' - and our guess is you won't see a bookie on one. So your best bet might be checking the latest odds. Unsurprisingly, Brazil are the favourites at 3/1, followed by Argentina at 9/2 and Spain at 11/2. England sit alongside Portugal, Holland, Colombia and Italy on 25/1."
2014-05-29,Look To The Past For Help To Buy's Future,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140529200554/http://news.sky.com/story/1271441/look-to-the-past-for-help-to-buys-future,"It's not often the Government goes out of its way to tell people one of its policies hasn't been a runaway success, but that's precisely what seems to be happening today with Help to Buy. 
	The Treasury has published the first figures on the take-up of the controversial mortgage guarantee bit of the Help to Buy scheme and is at pains to point out how small those numbers are. 
	A ""mere"" 7,313 properties have been bought using the mortgage guarantee scheme since it started up in October, only 1.2% of total transactions. 
	The average property bought under the scheme was worth only £151, 597. And the vast majority of these purchases have been outside London and the South East. 
	To put this in perspective, more guarantees were issued in Orkney than in Camden and Westminster put together, while the biggest ""hotspot"" for the scheme was Leeds, where it was used 116 times in its first six months. 
	When the Treasury unveiled the Help to Buy scheme last spring, the Chancellor was adamant that, unlike previous attempts to kickstart housing activity, this one would have far better take-up - hence the high £600,000 threshold for eligible properties. 
	So why the reticence about its use now? 
	In large part it comes down to public opinion about the housing market. There are widespread concerns about the existence of a bubble in British property - most specifically in London. 
	Whereas this time last year the Chancellor's main concern was the threat of a triple-dip recession, today he is more worried about being seen as responsible for another property crash. 
	Which is why the Treasury is at pains to point out the scheme is hardly being used at all in London and that only a fraction of the total - 31 of 7,313 - applications were for properties worth between £500,000 and £600,000. 
	But, to get back to the original point, is the impact of the scheme as small as comes across from the Treasury's press release? Not necessarily. 
	For one thing, if you look at the numbers on a six-monthly basis, as the Treasury does, this underplays the acceleration in recent months. 
	In its first quarter, the mortgage guarantee scheme accounted for a mere 0.3% of property transactions, but in its second quarter, from January to March this year, it accounted for 2%. And the usage is rising quite quickly. 
	As it happens, it's already far more popular than the Thatcher government's famous Right to Buy scheme, which enabled council tenants to purchase their homes, was in its first six months. 
	There were 2,328 homes sold in England under Right to Buy in the scheme's first six months, from October 1980 to the spring of 1981. 
	The Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme, by contrast, has been responsible for 5,890 sales in England in its first six months. 
	Add on the new-build element of the scheme and the total comes to around 20,000 (or 16,000 if you just take the first six months of that new-build scheme, which began earlier than the mortgage guarantee element). 
	Now, that 20,000 rate is considerably lower than the 52,000 properties per six months rate the Right to Buy scheme achieved in its second year of operation. 
	And it should be noted that while the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme's numbers are still rising, the new-build scheme's popularity seems to have plateaued in recent months. 
	All the same, the point remains that Help to Buy is already proving itself to be an extraordinarily powerful, popular, widespread policy, whatever the Government would have you believe."
2014-05-29,Chilcot Report Edges Closer Amid Icy Exchanges,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140529200554/http://news.sky.com/story/1271525/chilcot-report-edges-closer-amid-icy-exchanges,"At last, 11 years after British and American forces invaded Iraq and five years after Sir John Chilcot began his official inquiry into Britain’s role in the war, it seems that the report could soon be published – perhaps even before the 2015 General Election, as David Cameron has demanded. 
	The report has been delayed by a stand-off between the inquiry team and two successive Cabinet Secretaries, Sir Gus (now Lord) O’Donnell and Sir Jeremy Heywood, who blocked publication of conversations and private notes between Tony Blair and then US President George W Bush on confidentiality grounds. 
	They also opposed publication of Cabinet minutes and other official records. 
	Tony Blair has repeatedly denied that he was the cause of the hold-up. Both O’Donnell and Heywood worked closely with his government. 
	Now an icily choreographed public exchange between Chilcot and the Cabinet Office confirms that the logjam has been broken. 
	Chilcot had been embarrassing the government deliberately by refusing to go ahead with one of the final legal steps required before publication of an official report - so-called ""Maxwellisation"". 
	Named after a 1969 court victory by the late disgraced business tycoon Robert Maxwell, this process requires that those criticised in the report are sent drafts of the relevant sections for comment prior to publication. 
	The inquiry is not required to take on board what they say. 
	The inquiry argued that their report would be incomplete unless they could refer to cabinet minutes and details of the Blair Bush relationship. 
	They argued that Blair and other members of his team had already negated the high expectation of confidentiality traditionally granted to a Prime Minister in their own published memoirs. 
	In essence, publication of the details of these exchanges should allow the public to decide whether Tony Blair committed Britain to war at an early stage come what may. 
	Documents will still not be published in full. But the Cabinet Secretary agreed earlier this year that the inquiry can give details from over 200 Cabinet level meetings, including quoting extracts of the minutes. 
	Yesterday the two sides also agreed that they will now negotiate on what ""gists and quotes"" they can include from 25 notes from Blair to Bush and more than 130 records of conversations between the two leaders. 
	Direct quotation will be ""the minimum necessary"" but the public announcement of a deal suggests that the government side has given ground decisively. 
	Unless there is exceptional foot dragging during the negotiations, they should be concluded in a matter of weeks. The inquiry team has already completed its draft and specified what it would like to quote. 
	Maxwellisation is a private matter between the inquiry and its subjects but on past form it should take no longer than three months. 
	After that Sir John says he will submit the finished report to the Prime Minister, ""as soon as possible"". 
	It will then be up to David Cameron to decide when we get to see the Iraq Inquiry report."

	Who, now, will not watch it and wonder if they can believe in everything they see? 
	That a soft tackle, an open goal missed or a fluffed attempt at a save isn't the result of a brown envelope delivery to a team hotel? 
	The spectre of match-fixing will haunt any sporting contest, given the slightest encouragement. 
	It's not clear what form that encouragement has taken with regard to the Scotland v Nigeria game, but it has damaged the fixture in a way Fifa will not want repeated in the World Cup. 
	It would kill the tournament and the game itself would struggle to recover. 
	Brazil will host hundreds of players. All top professionals, but many with no chance of victory and no prospect of earning the millions pocketed by the likes of Suarez, Gerrard and Messi. 
	What would be a result for them in Brazil? For some, maybe it would be ten thousand dollars in their back pocket from a gambling syndicate in the Far East. The player who might ask himself: why not? 
	Hopefully, a voice in his head would tell him to consider the victims. I count myself among them. 
	I'm currently reading the excellent book by Richard Gordon - ""Scotland '74: A World Cup Story."" 
	It reveals suspicions among Scotland players surrounding the score line that sealed their first round exit - the 9-0 defeat of Zaire by Yugoslavia. 
	There is no evidence that the match was fixed but, 40 years on, the doubts of the dressing room raise questions. 
	At a criminal level, there are serious matters that should, perhaps, have been addressed. 
	But beyond that are the hopes and dreams of the Tartan Army of the day. 
	Could that dream team with Billy Bremner, Denis Law et al have got closer to the trophy, as close as we all thought they might? Were they as good as we thought they were? 
	I suppose we'll never know. We'll never know if they simply weren't good enough because now we think they might have been thwarted by cheats. 
	Maybe we could have been World Cup winners... let the torture of '74 begin. Again. 
	A victimless crime? No way. Match-fixing kills the dream. And if you kill the dream, you kill football."

	Michael Wheatley was already serving 13 life sentences at Standford Hill prison on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, when he was granted day release and failed to return on May 3. 
	The 55-year-old - nicknamed the ""Skullcracker"" for pistol-whipping victims - raided the Chelsea Building Society in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey, four days later. 
	He pointed a handgun at staff and made off with £18,350, Guildford Crown Court heard. 
	Wheatley was arrested hours later in Tower Hamlets, East London, and most of the money was recovered. 
	The gun, real or imitation, was never found. 
	Appearing via a video link from Belmarsh Prison, Wheatley pleaded guilty to robbery, possession of a firearm, or imitation firearm while committing an offence, and being unlawfully at large. 
	His solicitor urged Judge Christopher Critchlow to pass sentence once CCTV footage of the robbery had been viewed. 
	The court heard Wheatley robbed the same building society branch 13 years ago and staff had been told to be on their guard while he was on the run. 
	He showed no emotion as Judge Critchlow passed sentence and told him: ""It is clear the public must be protected from you for a long time."" 
	Wheatley has spent a total of 46 years in institutions, starting at the age of six, the court heard."
2014-05-29,Help To Buy: Most Loans Go To First Time Buyers,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140529200554/http://news.sky.com/story/1271184/help-to-buy-most-loans-go-to-first-time-buyers,"Some 80% of the Help To Buy loans granted in the mortgage scheme's first six months were given to first time buyers, the Treasury has said. 
	A total of 7,313 loans were issued between October last year and March this year, with a total value of £1bn. 
	The average value of each loan taken out under the controversial scheme was £136,742. 
	Only about 1% of all mortgages taken out in the period were helped by the scheme, undermining critics of the programme who have said it is prompting a house price bubble. 
	Most mortgage completions through the scheme were on properties outside London and in regions where prices are lower. 
	A high proportion of homes supported by the scheme were in the North West and the East of England. 
	Blackstock property expert Andrew Teacher said: ""Today's figures reinforce the fact that Help to Buy has not helped to blow up the London market as numerous commentators have suggested. 
	""The figures show the scheme has been most effective in areas of reduced growth where prices have remained relatively flat."" 
	The mean value of a property purchased or remortgaged through the scheme is £151,597, compared to a national average house price of £252,000. 
	A total of 38% of loans were for terraced houses. 
	The scheme's rollout in October saw only four completions, followed by 164 in November and 818 in December. 
	However, the monthly figure jumped significantly in the first three months of this year. 
	In January, completions reached 1,580, while the number rose further in February and March, to 2,090 and 2,657 respectively. 
	Only 5% - a total of 385 completions - were made on properties in the capital. 
	The Help To Buy mortgage guarantee scheme was boosted by a second phase equity loan scheme in the spring. 
	Data for both phases shows a total of 27,861 homes were bought under the scheme, with 85% of sales to first-time buyers. 
	Prime Minister David Cameron said: ""Help to Buy has helped thousands of hardworking people to buy a new home and crucially it is helping to increase the number of new homes being built around the country. 
	""It is an important part of our long term plan to back those who want to get on and to secure a better future for Britain."" 
	Meanwhile, net lending to small and medium sized businesses as part of the Bank of England's Funding for Lending Scheme dropped  by £723m in Q1, amid a focus on business loans. 
	The Bank said that between February and March lenders drew just £2bn from the scheme. It was launched in mid-2012 to encourage banks to improve borrowing facilities."
2014-05-29,Islam 'Satanic' Comments Defended By Robinson,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140529200554/http://news.sky.com/story/1271228/islam-satanic-comments-defended-by-robinson,"Northern Ireland First Minister Peter Robinson has stoked controversy by saying he would not trust Muslims for spiritual guidance but would to ""go down the shops for me"". 
	The Democratic Unionist leader is facing criticism over his remarks which defended a contentious sermon made by Pastor James McConnell, in which the pastor branded Islam ""satanic"" and a ""doctrine spawned in hell"". 
	Police are now investigating to see if its contents constitute a hate crime. Mr Robinson has said his comments have been ""misinterpreted"". 
	The First Minister, who has attended the fundamentalist Protestant preacher's church in Belfast, said he supported the pastor's right to criticise the Islamic faith. 
	In a fiery address earlier this month, Mr McConnell said: ""People say there are good Muslims in Britain - that may be so - but I don't trust them. 
	""Islam is heathen, Islam is satanic, Islam is a doctrine spawned in hell."" 
	In an interview with the Irish News, Mr Robinson insisted the pastor did not have ""an ounce of hatred"" in his body. 
	He said a Christian minister had a right to ""denounce false doctrines"". 
	Mr Robinson said he would not trust Muslims for spiritual guidance, or those engaged in terrorist acts. 
	But he added: ""Would I trust them to go down the shops for me? Of course I would. Would I trust them to do a number of other lifetime, normal day-to-day issues? There's no reason why you wouldn't."" 
	The controversy has erupted at a time when race hate attacks in Northern Ireland are on the increase. 
	In a statement on Thursday, Mr Robinson said he had not intended his comments ""to insult or cause distress to local Muslims"" and said his words had been ""misinterpreted"". 
	He said: ""I very much value their contribution at every level to our society and I will take the opportunity to meet with local Muslim leaders to demonstrate my ongoing support for them as integral law abiding citizens in Northern Ireland."" 
	Mr Robinson said he still believed in Pastor McConnell's right to freedom of speech. 
	Northern Ireland's Equality Commission, which monitors compliance with equality legislation, criticised the pastor's sermon and raised concern over Mr Robinson's comments. 
	Chief Commissioner Dr Michael Wardlow said: ""It is incumbent on all leaders in public life to demonstrate in what they say, and what they do not say, a real and true respect for all human beings. 
	""Those in a position to influence others should not use language which may increase the vulnerability and legitimate fears of people who already feel isolated and under attack because of their race and religion."" 
	Sinn Fein Deputy First Minister and former IRA commander Martin McGuinness, who has already accused the pastor of hate-mongering, has told his partner in government to show some leadership. 
	""All of us in positions of leadership have a responsibility to represent and stand up for all the people of our society,"" he said. 
	But this provoked an angry response from Mr Robinson on Twitter, who said: ""I won't take lectures from a self-confessed leader of a bloody terrorist organisation on equality, tolerance and mutual respect for all."""

	Stephen Carroll was shot dead as he sat in an unmarked police car in Craigavon, County Armagh, in March 2009, having been lured to his death by a bogus 999 call. 
	The 48-year-old, from Banbridge, County Down, was the first member of Northern Ireland's new police service to be murdered. 
	His death came two days after Sappers Mark Quinsey and Patrick Azimkar were shot dead outside Massareene Barracks in Antrim. 
	Brendan McConville, a former Sinn Fein councillor who quit the party after the Good Friday Agreement, and John Paul Wootton were found guilty of the killing in March 2012. 
	McConville, 43, of Craigavon, and Wootton, 23, of nearby Lurgan, who was just 17 years old at the time of the murder, were jailed for a minimum of 25 years and 14 years respectively. 
	Defence lawyers had claimed the convictions were unsafe and argued there should not be a retrial in the case. 
	The prosecution said the evidence of one defence witness in the appeal was ""inherently unreliable"". 
	Constable Carroll's wife Kate, who sat through every day of the trial and subsequent appeal, said she knew her worst fears had been realised when two of her husband's colleagues knocked on the door. 
	She said: ""He always told me two of them would come if something happened, a senior officer and a policewoman. 
	""It was disbelief. How could it be Steve? I just felt, 'Oh my God, they've made a mistake, it can't be Steve'. 
	""He was always so vigilant in everything ... I thought Steve was invincible but who or how can you stop a bullet?"" 
	Recalling the last time she saw her husband, she said: ""We kissed each other goodbye and then he came back and said, 'Give me another one'. Then he said, 'If I die now, I'll die a happy man'. 
	""I'll never forget those last words. I have goose-bumps just thinking about them now."" 
	She added: ""I would like Steve to be remembered as the catalyst for the change in Northern Ireland. 
	""He was a good man and that's how I would like other people to be - be kind to one another, show one another tolerance."" 
	Speaking after the decision, Detective Chief Inspector Ricky Harkness said: ""Our thoughts today are with Kate Carroll and the Carroll family. 
	""This case proceeded through the criminal justice system, passing every test in terms of grounds for arrest, evidence to charge, going to trial and securing convictions. 
	""We welcome this decision. It is an acknowledgement of all the hard work by Serious Crime Branch detectives and partner agencies to get justice for a valued and much missed colleague. 
	""More than two people were involved in the murder of Constable Carroll. 
	""Anyone with any information about others involved in the attack is asked to contact police on the non-emergency number 101. Information can also be provided anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."""
2014-05-29,Manchester United Owner Malcolm Glazer Dies,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140529200554/http://news.sky.com/story/1270908/manchester-united-owner-malcolm-glazer-dies,"Malcolm Glazer, the head of the family that owns Manchester United football club, has died aged 85. 
	The news was announced by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the American football club he owned for nearly 30 years. 
	The club said he passed away on Wednesday morning and described him as a ""pioneering thinker"" and ""dynamic business leader"". 
	Mr Glazer, who lived in Palm Beach, Florida, bought Manchester United in 2005 - sparking a number of protests in the city. 
	After that, the football club won five Premier League titles (2007, 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2013), as well as the 2008 Champions League title. 
	But the club had a disastrous season this year, culminating in the departure of manager David Moyes. 
	Sky's Sports Correspondent Paul Kelso said Mr Glazer's passing is a ""significant moment"" for Old Trafford. 
	Mr Glazer was a ""hugely, hugely divisive"" and ""very unpopular"" figure in Manchester, he said. 
	He said there were some violent protests after his leveraged buy-out, in which he borrowed a huge sum of money to buy the club and paid off the interest with its profits. 
	The club had no debts before the takeover and now owes nearly £400m. 
	Kelso said he does not think Mr Glazer's death will have much of an impact on Manchester United because he had been ill for some years and the club is being run by his family. 
	Mr Glazer once owned 100% of Old Trafford, but then passed his holding to his sons and daughter. 
	They own 90%, with the other 10% floated on the New York stock exchange. 
	Manchester United said in a statement: ""The thoughts of everyone at Manchester United are with the Glazer family tonight ... Staff at Manchester United extend deep and sincere condolences to them all at this difficult time."" 
	After his death was announced, fans' tributes - both positive and negative - started to pour in on forums and social media. 
	Mosley909, a poster on one Manchester United fan site, wrote: ""Sad for those who love him and always sad when someone dies, but can't say I'll be shedding any tears."" 
	Another poster, Andy McDonald, tweeted: ""Don't understand these 'fans' disregarding Malcolm Glazer, our success was just as much his too. Forever a part of the MUFC family, R.I.P."" 
	Mr Glazer leaves behind his wife Linda, six children and 14 grandchildren."

	The British Council's (BC) archive first went online in 2012, and the final 25 clips show scenes including England's pub culture, Sheffield's steel industry and Scotland Yard Flying Squad's search for stolen cases of tea. 
	All of the films were produced to show off the UK around the world during global conflict. 
	BC film director Briony Hanson said: ""These films give us one last glimpse into a Britain that's different and familiar in equal measure. 
	""Some things like air raid shelters in London's parks and a Sheffield dominated by the steel industry are things of the past - but there are also trips to the pub, police dramas and, of course, a lot of tea."" 
	The BC has also launched an international competition called View From Here to encourage people to look into national identity by re-editing the existing films or producing new ones on similar themes."
2014-05-29,Online Abuse: Police Deal With Thousands Of Kids,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140529200554/http://news.sky.com/story/1271004/online-abuse-police-deal-with-thousands-of-kids,"By Tom Cheshire, Technology Correspondent Almost 2,000 children have been investigated by police in the last three years for breaking laws used to crack down on social media abuse, offensive Twitter messages and online bullying, Sky News has learned. 
	New figures show children as young as nine are among more than 1,200 who have then been charged with a criminal offence or given a caution, warning or fine. 
	The Sky News investigation also found almost 20,000 adults were the subject of police probes for these offences, the equivalent of around 20 cases a day. 
	And the number of cases is on the rise - up more than 5% since 2011. 
	The figures, obtained through Freedom of Information requests, lay bare for the first time how policing the internet has become a daily task for Britain's forces. 
	And as 18 of the UK's police forces failed to provide figures, the true number of investigations is likely to be much greater. 
	They include a series of high-profile prosecutions in recent years of people accused of posting abuse on Twitter. 
	Ellie, a teenage victim of online harassment who reported her case to police, told Sky News she thought the figures were ""shocking"". 
	She said she suffered death threats and comments about her family on social media. 
	""They stalked me and knew a lot about me,"" she said. 
	""I drove at the time and where I used to live there's a little bridge. And within hours of driving over it, there was a comment saying you should have crashed your car over the bridge you drove over. 
	""With bullying that happens at school, people can get away from it at home. For me, this literally followed me everywhere I went."" 
	Sky News asked police forces how many investigations they had launched in the last three years under Section 127 of the 2003 Communications Act, which covers abuse on Twitter or other social media sites, in text messages or through nuisance phone calls. 
	New guidance issued last year raised the threshold for prosecution, but experts say the rise in the number of cases despite the stricter definition is the result of easy internet access via smartphones. 
	According to responses from 34 police forces, 6,919 people were investigated in 2011/12 under Section 127, including 744 children. 
	In 2012/13, 6,974 cases were probed including 578 under-18s. After the first nine months of 2013/14, those figures had already hit 7,318 and 610 respectively. 
	Over the three years, 1,932 children were investigated and 1,203 were either charged with a criminal offence, fined, cautioned or warned verbally. Of the 19,279 adults investigated over that period, 11,292 were subject to police action. 
Hertfordshire Police investigated and charged the most people in 2013 - 1,042, up from 291 in 2011. The Metropolitan Police had the highest three-year figure, 2,099. 
	Four 10-year-olds and one nine-year-old in Tayside were given warnings by police. 
	Luke Roberts, a social network expert at Beat Bullying, told Sky News: ""There are more devices than ever. So whether it's smartphones, internet-connected TVs, more apps - they allow more young people to be harassed than ever before. 
	""In terms of social networking, we'd like to see more transparency, in terms of giving clear reporting mechanisms to children."" 
	Parenting expert Erika Brodnock told Sky News: ""This will continue to be an issue until we equip children with the skills to navigate the digital world and to be resilient to bullying. 
	""Online activity should be treated exactly the same as offline – parents shouldn’t allow their children to play unsupervised on the internet."" 
	Anti-bullying campaigner Alex Holmes said: ""I’m quite concerned about criminalising young people. 
	""I’m a little worried because it’s quite serious for a young person to carry that label with them for the rest of their life."" 
	While the number of children being investigated for online abuse is rising, the proportion of children using social networks is falling. 
	According to Ofcom research, 35% of 5-15 year olds have an active social networking profile – down from 42% in 2011 and 43% in 2012. 
	Meanwhile two thirds of adults have a social networking profile – a figure unchanged since 2012, according to Ofcom.

	The 77-year-old has previously hinted he may call it a day after finishing his latest film Jimmy's Hall. 
	However, he said it is always tempting to keep going. 
	Speaking at the UK premiere of the film, which is about an Irish political activist in the 1930s, Loach said he would watch the World Cup and then ""think again"". 
	""There are so many stories to tell and documentaries are a good way of working as well,"" he said. 
	""There's never any shortage of characters to put on screen or things you want to reflect on. 
	""There's always an abundance of material, so that's never the problem really."" 
	When promoting the film in Cannes last week, Loach said: ""I think if you have it right at the beginning of your career, you tend to see everything as downhill after that ... it's good to come near the end but when there are still a few goals left in the forward line."" 
	Barry Ward, who plays the lead character James Gralton in Loach's forthcoming movie, also finds it hard to believe Jimmy's Hall could be the director's last feature film. 
	""He had come out with that quote before we began shooting which, if anything, gave it an extra sense of specialness,"" he said. 
	""But we were all there to do a job, so that was at the back of our minds. I also think most of us had an inkling he wasn't going to retire so easily."" 
	He added: ""Give him a good enough story and ... he'll make the movie. He's not retiring."" 
	Loach has had a critically acclaimed career, with a series of award-winning films. 
	In 2006, he was awarded the coveted Palme D'Or at the Cannes Film Festival for The Wind That Shakes The Barley, a war drama set during the Irish War of Independence and Irish Civil War. 
	Three years later, he collaborated with former Manchester United soccer star Eric Cantona on Looking for Eric, which showed at the Cannes Film Festival. 
	In 2013, he was awarded the Golden Bear, a lifetime achievement award, at the Berlin Film Festival."

	The Liberal Democrat leader said he had spoken to Dr Cable, who is in China on a trip as Business Secretary, and did not believe ""for a second"" he was behind the leak of a damaging poll. 
	He said there was no question of him sacking Dr Cable, in the wake of the botched coup by the Liberal Democrat peer Lord Oakeshott to trigger a leadership contest. 
	Speaking on his LBC radio show Call Clegg, he said: ""He was absolutely not aware of polls elsewhere. He has made it very, very clear that he, for instance, didn't want any questions about leadership in the poll which he did have some control over in his own constituency. 
	""So, look I fully expect that people will try and suggest that there are endless plots and conspiracies. I don't believe that for a second. Vince is an outstanding Secretary of State for Business. He and I have worked together for years and years and years and we are going to continue to work together in harness as part of a really strong Lib Dem team in government. Full stop."" 
	Mr Clegg also insisted that he had not been crying before he appeared with red-rimmed eyes in an interview on Monday but that he had been tired from campaigning. 
	He said he remained ""absolutely gutted"" by the party's performance in the local and European elections. 
	Meanwhile Dr Cable has reiterated his support for Mr Clegg and again condemned the anti-Clegg poll commissioned by his close friend Lord Oakeshott. 
	He knew nothing of the poll in Mr Clegg's Sheffield Hallam constituency until he read about it in the newspapers, he told the BBC, and said ""there was no disloyalty"". 
	Dr Cable said: ""People are putting round the story that there is some division on that. There is not. I made it absolutely clear from the beginning of this week that there is absolutely no leadership issue."" 
	He has, however, admitted knowing about the other polls authorised by Lord Oakeshott, which showed key Lib Dems could lose seats in the 2015 vote. 
	David Cameron has backed Dr Cable saying he judged him solely on his performance as Business Secretary, a role he was performing well. 
	Lord Oakeshott resigned on Wednesday after the beleaguered Lib Dem leader threatened him with the sack for commissioning and leaking an ICM poll, which showed Mr Clegg could lose his seat at the next election. 
	In his resignation statement, Lord Oakeshott, who had leaked the research anonymously, said he had informed Dr Cable of the results of the poll several weeks ago. 
	The disclosure sparked significant questions for Dr Cable, who came out to condemn Lord Oakeshott's actions on Tuesday after speculation he was behind the attempted coup. 
	The Lib Dem peer also said the party was heading for ""disaster"" under Mr Clegg's leadership. He refused to comment any further on the matter or what Dr Cable knew when questioned on Thursday morning. 
	Pressure on Mr Clegg to step down continues to intensify, with increasing calls for him to put his leadership to the vote in a contest after dismal local and European election results. 
	The Social Liberal Forum, which represents left-leaning Lib Dems, has written a letter to The Times, calling for a leadership ""that people can listen to""."

	She sometimes wears glasses and often wears her shoulder-length black hair in a ponytail."
