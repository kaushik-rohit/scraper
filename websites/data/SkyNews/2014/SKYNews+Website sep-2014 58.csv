2014-09-20,Alice Gross Police Search Is Largest Since 7/7,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140920185125/http://news.sky.com/story/1339183/alice-gross-police-search-is-largest-since-7-7,"By Tom Parmenter, Sky Correspondent The search for missing teenager Alice Gross is now the biggest deployment of Metropolitan Police search assets since the 7/7 terror attacks in London. 
	The 14-year-old from Hanwell, west London, has been missing for 24 days and police continue to make new appeals for information. 
	Detectives revealed this week they are also searching for Latvian national Arnis Zalkans, 41, who disappeared from his home in nearby Ealing on September 3 - a week after Alice disappeared. 
The 41-year-old was jailed in his native country in the late 1990s for murdering his wife and burying her in a forest following a dispute about her sexuality. 
	It has also emerged Zalkalns was arrested in London on suspicion of indecent assault on a 14-year-old girl in 2009, but was never charged. 
	Search teams, including dogs and divers, have been deployed across west London looking for Alice, and police say the search area is being widened. 
	Detective Superintendent Carl Mehta, said: ""I would like to thank the local community who have shown great support to the search effort and police investigation so far. 
	""Our officers are working through the weekend - carrying on those searches. We will not stop our hunt for Alice. Whilst we have already seized many hundreds of hours of CCTV we still need the public's help. 
	""If you are a shop owner, have CCTV at your home, or were out filming in the areas of Ealing and Hanwell and have footage from the afternoon of Thursday 28 August when Alice was last seen, and right up to the 3 September when Arnis Zalkalns was last seen, then please get in touch with us. 
	""Save the footage, call into our incident room on 020 8358 0100, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."" 
	Some 630 officers from eight police forces have been involved in the hunt. They have searched 25sq km of open land and 5.5km of canals and rivers. 
	Former Met Police search adviser Keith Farquharson was involved in the operation after the 7/7 attacks. 
	He told Sky News: ""There will be a whole team of officers following up leads, interviewing people, interviewing witnesses to glean that information that will lead to the actual whereabouts of Alice. 
	""That will be fed down to the search teams to give them a good idea and point them in the right direction."" 
	Mr Farquharson explained that the police teams will continue to pursue new leads and will not be deterred by the length of time since Alice disappeared. 
	""Never say never - it will always depend on that one snippet of information that could lead to the breakthrough in the case."" 
	On Friday night, police searched a former home of Zalkalns in Hanwell. 
	The owner of the house, Radoslav Andric, said he last saw Zalkalns at the rental property two days before Alice went missing on August 28. 
	Mr Andric said the Latvian builder moved out more than a year ago, but had returned to see friends. 
	Police have recovered the suspect's red Trek bicycle from the property. 
	Forensic officers have also searched Zalkalns' semi-detached house in Ealing, where armed officers have been seen standing guard. 
	Zalkalns has not accessed his bank account or used his mobile phone since September 3, nor has he returned home to his partner and young child. 
	He was seen on CCTV footage cycling along a path by the Grand Union Canal 15 minutes after the last sighting of Alice. 
	Detectives believe he is likely to have seen Alice as they were both going north along the canal towpath."
2014-09-20,Woman's Road-Rage Attack Caught On CCTV,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140920185125/http://news.sky.com/story/1339337/womans-road-rage-attack-caught-on-cctv,"CCTV footage of a woman's vicious road-rage attack has been released by police, who are appealing for witnesses. 
	The victim of the assault is seen walking along Wellington Road in Birmingham's Perry Barr when her attacker grabs her around the neck and hurls her into a table outside a grocery store. 
	She is then pulled to her feet before being thrown to the ground once again, as bystanders look on. 
	Police say the victim had earlier asked the other woman to move the VW Tournan she was in as it was blocking her vehicle, only for her attacker to verbally abuse her in response. 
	Following the assault, officers say the woman spotted the victim making a note of her vehicle registration and attacked her again. 
	The woman being sought by police is described as white, in her early 20s, with long brown hair tied back in a ponytail, and wearing a black vest top and grey tracksuit bottoms. 
	The 44-year-old victim suffered a head injury and bruising following the assault, which took place at around 1pm on July 30. 
	PC Geraldine Sprigg, from West Midlands Police, said: ""This was an unprovoked and violent attack on a woman who had asked the driver to move her car, which was blocking the road. 
	""The assault took place in the middle of the day and we are asking for anyone who saw the incident or who recognises the woman driver to contact us. The woman assaulted suffered pain and discomfort following the attack and may have lost consciousness for a short time."" 
	Anyone with information is asked to call police at Birmingham West and Central on 101 or Crimestoppers, confidentially, on 0800 555111."
2014-09-20,Miliband: More Important Things Than Devo Max,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140920185125/http://news.sky.com/story/1339172/miliband-more-important-things-than-devo-max,"Ed Miliband has side-stepped the issue of constitutional change, saying the issue matters - but is not the priority for most voters. 
	Prime Minister David Cameron says all parts of the UK should have more powers after the independence referendum in Scotland, but Mr Miliband says the process is being rushed. 
	His comments come after former prime minister Gordon Brown said he was ""utterly convinced"" powers for Scotland would be delivered following the No vote. 
	But speaking ahead of the Labour Party conference in Manchester, Mr Miliband said: ""The last few months have been about keeping our country together. The next eight months will be about how we can change our country together. 
	""Right across Britain, people are yearning for change. Constitutional change matters. 
	""But we all know something else matters even more. Our country doesn't work for everyday working people and only works for a privileged few at the top. And we've got to change it."" 
	It followed the earlier speech by Mr Brown, whose intervention in the campaign has been credited with helping to secure a No vote, and who insisted the timetable for devolution he set out two weeks ago was on track. 
	A resolution on more powers will be signed by him and the three main party leaders in the House of Commons on Monday, he told a news conference in Dunfermline, Scotland. 
	The civil service is already working on the plans, which will be published ""by the end of October,"" he added. 
	He said the timetable was a ""way of bringing people together"" and ""this is time for Scotland to unite"". 
	""These are men who have been promise makers and they will not be promise breakers. I will ensure that as a promise keeper that these promises that have been made will be upheld. 
	""We will lock in today the promises that have been made and why the timetable we set out will be delivered."" 
	He said the laws that will form the Scotland Bill, and eventually the Scotland Act, will be ready by Burns Day (January 25). 
	Mr Brown also praised Scotland First Minister Alex Salmond, who dramatically quit on Friday night after the country turned out in record numbers to reject a break from the UK by 55% to 45%. 
	Mr Salmond was a ""fierce and formidable opponent"" but people owed him a ""debt of gratitude"" for what he had done for Scotland, he said. 
	The outcome of the referendum vote saw 2,001,926 opting for the No camp, with 1,617,989 voting Yes to independence. 
	The Yes campaign won majorities in four areas, including Dundee and Glasgow. 
	Six people were arrested in Glasgow city centre on Friday night as police separated rival union and independence supporters. 
	Hundreds of people crowded into George Square, with a chorus of Rule Britannia countered by the Scottish anthem, Flower of Scotland."
2014-09-20,Devolution Wranglings Could End In Stalemate,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140920185125/http://news.sky.com/story/1339126/devolution-wranglings-could-end-in-stalemate,"By Darren McCaffrey, Sky Political Reporter Acclaimed as the man who helped save the Union, Gordon Brown has issued a warning following the No vote. 
Amid disagreements on wider devolution plans among Westminster leaders, the former prime minister pleaded for unity and a proper timetable for further Scottish devolution. 
	He called on David Cameron, Nick Clegg and his own leader Ed Miliband to stick to the timetable he laid out in the final few weeks of the referendum campaign or face letting down the Scottish people. 
	His Scotland Act, announced a few weeks ago, would establish a new rate of income tax, devolve stamp duty and create borrowing powers for the Scottish parliamentÂ  and would be implemented next year. 
	But with Mr Cameron promising he would honour his pledge for devolution in full with draft legislation by Burns night on January 25, why the warning? 
	Further devolution for Scotland, which in principle and in practice the parties mostly agree on, has become linked to wider constitutional change across the UK, upon which there is little to no agreement. 
	Boris Johnson summed up the thoughts of many Tory MPs when he said: ""Let's not give any more sauce to the goose until we've given some sauce to the gander."" 
	That includes English only MP votes for English only laws, or as it's known at Westminster, the West Lothian question. 
	The Conservatives have long campaigned against the current system seeing it as unfair, and unpopular with English voters. 
	Labour are less keen, simply because they have more Scottish MPs, 41 this Parliament, compared to one Conservative and have had to reply on that Scottish support in the past to get through or indeed block legislation. 
	So recognising the need to honour the Scottish devolution question, Labour want it to go ahead as soon as possible but decouple it from any wider constitutional reform. 
	And with the Liberal Democrats wanting consensus we could see political stalemate. Hence Gordon Brown's warning. So what will happen? 
	Labour seem unlikely to back down, claiming it is simply too big a change to rush through, so will the Conservatives blink and break the link between the two devolution issues? 
	Given the damage that delaying Scottish devolution may cause, the Tories may well allow it to proceed against the wish of many Conservative backbenchers. 
	If they do, the Tories will make some political hay - with it becoming an election issue. 
	In English constituencies they will claim it is Labour supporting an unfair and unpopular constitutional anomaly. 
	Constitutional reform in the UK has always been ad hoc, slow, incrementalÂ  and uncoordinated. This time it looks like it will be no different."
2014-09-20,Govt Pledges Â£12m To Tackle Calais Migrants,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140920185125/http://news.sky.com/story/1339331/govt-pledges-12m-to-tackle-calais-migrants,"The Government will provide Â£12m over three years to help tackle the problem of illegal immigrants in Calais trying to gain entry to Britain. 
	Home Secretary Theresa May and her French counterpart Bernard Cazeneuve have reached an agreement which will see more co-operation between the British and French law enforcement agencies. 
	The deal will also involve strengthened security at the port, which has seen an increasing number of migrants using it as a staging post for efforts to cross the English Channel. 
	In a joint statement Mrs May and Mr Cazeneuve promised to ""respond to health emergencies and protect vulnerable people"", in particular victims of human trafficking. 
	But they insisted the measures would not encourage immigrants to gather in Calais. 
	The UK will contribute Â£4m (â¬5m) a year for three years to a joint intervention fund. 
	Some of the money will be used to build fences and increase security in the parking area. 
	Officials from Britain and France will work to improve border controls and new technology could be installed to address the dangers of migrants hiding in tankers and refrigerated lorries. 
	The statement added: ""At the same time, efforts will be made to strengthen operational co-operation by establishing permanent joint mechanisms to deliver promptly the comprehensive action plan and enhance co-operation between British and French law enforcement agencies at the border. 
	""This will include helping to identify measures to ensure migrants do not breach the laws of either country or threaten the safety of Calais residents or those using the port. 
	""It will also support improved joint returns initiatives and further comprehensive action against those trying to evade immigration control."" 
	Information campaigns will begin next month, and these will explain ""the reality of illegal migration and its consequences in the United Kingdom"" and also provide information on asylum in France or assisted voluntary return. 
	Police and border agencies in both nations will work together to tackle the organised criminal networks responsible for people smuggling. 
	The National Crime Agency will second a full-time office to Ocriest, the French agency in charge of tackling illegal immigration. 
	French border police will send two officers each month to work with the joint border intelligence unit in Folkestone, Kent. 
	The two ministers also agreed to push for EU action on an ""evident migration crisis"" in the Mediterranean Sea."
2014-09-20,Two Britons Missing After Hurricane In Mexico,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140920185125/http://news.sky.com/story/1339053/two-britons-missing-after-hurricane-in-mexico,"Two Britons have disappeared off the coast of Mexico following a hurricane. 
	The pair, believed to be Paul Whitehouse and Simone Wood, were reported missing on Friday after their yacht overturned in the Gulf of California, also known as the Sea of Cortez. 
	They are reportedly a couple from Wolverhampton and London. 
	Mexican marines and sailors are taking part in a search operation. 
	Mr Whitehouse is believed to be a scuba instructor living in the city of La Paz. 
	The pair were believed to be living on their yacht in La Paz for around a year. 
	A spokeswoman for the UK Foreign Office said: ""We are in touch with the local authorities and are providing consular assistance to the families at this difficult time."" 
	The British Embassy in Mexico has advised UK nationals in Baja California and Baja California Sur, the areas affected by the hurricane, to leave through Los Cabos International Airport. 
	Hurricane Odile left a trail of destruction when it hit last Sunday, causing the evacuation of around 18,000 tourists. 
	The hurricane affected power and water supplies, as well as phone services, triggering widespread looting. 
	Power has been restored to around one-fifth of people in the resort cities of Los Cabos, with 200 electricity workers dispatched to the area."
2014-09-20,Thai Murders: Hannah DNA Matches Asian Men,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140920185125/http://news.sky.com/story/1339247/thai-murders-hannah-dna-matches-asian-men,"DNA taken from the body of murdered British tourist Hannah Witheridge matches that of two Asian men, Thai police say. 
	Officers also said they do not know if the killer is still on the island of KohÂ Tao, where she and David Miller, 24, were found murdered. 
	Sky News has obtained video of Ms Witheridge filmed in the hours before she was killed. 
	In the exclusive footage, she is seen on CCTV walking between bars with a group of friends. 
	Ms Witheridge, 23, from Great Yarmouth, suffered severe head wounds and Mr Miller died from blows to the head and drowning,Â post-mortem examinations showed. 
	Their bodies were found in a rocky area of Sairee beach on Monday. 
	A garden hoe with MsÂ Witheridge's blood on it was discovered nearby, and investigators are searching for a blunt metal object used on Mr Miller. 
	Sky's Jonathan Samuels, on Koh Tao (Turtle Island), said: ""Today the head of Thailand's police flew to the island by helicopter - really a sense of how seriously now the Thai authorities are taking this investigation. 
	""He confirmed that two men's DNA that was found on Hannah's body have been analysed and he has confirmed those two samples are from two Asian men. 
	""Of course they have no idea at the moment, as far as we understand, who these two men may be. 
	""They have questioned many people on the island, but so far they tell us they have no firm suspects."" 
	DNA on a cigarette butt has been matched to semen found on Ms Witheridge, and officers say the cigarette was smoked by more than one person. 
	Police Colonel Kissana said officers have still not come up with the exact number of suspects, and confirmed they are looking for both male and female suspects. 
	He said reports that the FBI are involved in the investigation were incorrect, but confirmed they have British assistance. 
	A cash reward worth about Â£4,000 is being offered for information that leads to the arrest of the killers, he added. 
	Meanwhile, two British brothers who were questioned by police have been told they are free to return home to Jersey. 
	Christopher and James Ware, childhood friends of Mr Miller, were spoken to by officers but were never detained or named as suspects. 
	A group of Burmese migrants who were interviewed by police after bloodstains were found on their clothes have also been eliminated from police inquiries."
2014-09-20,UK Hostage Murder Threat 'Against Sharia',https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140920185125/http://news.sky.com/story/1339048/uk-hostage-murder-threat-against-sharia,"A group of Muslim scholars has made a direct appeal to Islamic State (IS) militants to release British hostage Alan Henning. 
	In a video message posted online, the men told the 47-year-old's captors that killing him would be against Islamic law. 
	Mr Henning, a taxi driver from Salford, was delivering aid in Syria when he was captured in December near the town of al Dana. 
	Shaykh Haitham al Haddad, a qadi or judge in the Sharia council in London, said: ""This is to confirm that executing this man is totally haram (sinful), is impermissible, prohibited according to Sharia for a number of reasons."" 
	Ustadh Abu Eesa, director at Prophetic Guidance in Manchester, said Mr Henning had joined a Muslim charity convoy because he ""passionately believes in helping the most needy"". 
	He said: ""No matter what our differences, no matter how differently we see the world, what there is no doubt about is that the killing of an innocent man is not permitted in the religion of Allah. 
	""It is not permissible whatsoever to harm a person who believes that he is safe among the people he is working with. This safety must be honoured."" 
	A third scholar, Imam Shakeel Begg from the Lewisham Islamic Centre, said Mr Henning was innocent. 
	He added: ""Whatever your grievance, whatever your cause, this man is innocent."" 
	It comes after more than 100 Muslim leaders signed a statement pleading for IS to release Mr Henning and branding them ""monsters"" for the murder of fellow hostage David Haines. 
	In a letter in the Independent newspaper, they said: ""We, the undersigned British Muslim Imams, organisations and individuals, wish to express our horror and revulsion at the senseless murder of David Haines and the threat to the life of our fellow British citizen, Alan Henning."" 
	Mr Henning appeared at the end of a video released by IS militants last Saturday in which Mr Haines was beheaded. The video contained a threat that he would be killed next. 
	Separate video footage - filmed before his capture - showed him saying it was ""all worthwhile"" to ensure aid got to where it was most needed in Syria."
2014-09-20,NHS Staff Asked To Help Africa's Ebola Fight,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140920185125/http://news.sky.com/story/1339030/nhs-staff-asked-to-help-africas-ebola-fight,"NHS staff are being encouraged to volunteer to help with the deadly ebola virus outbreak which is continuing to spread across West Africa. 
	The Department of Health's chief medical officer Professor Dame Sally Davies said doctors, nurses and paramedics are among the medical staff who are needed to help contribute towards efforts to tackle the crisis. 
	In a letter to health service staff, Dame Sally says those who wish to help should contact the UK International Emergency Medical Register, set up to respond to large-scale international emergencies.Â  
	British officials recently announced they were setting up a treatment centre in Kerrytown, Sierra Leone,Â following a direct request for help from the World Health Organisation and Sierra Leone. 
	The 62-bed facility will treat victims of the disease, including local and international health workers and volunteers. 
	The Government is working with the charity Save The Children to determine how the centre will be run once it has been fully set up, Dame Sally said. 
	""The UK has been at the forefront of responding to the epidemic,"" Dame Sally wrote. 
	""It is acknowledged that the key to combating this epidemic is supporting in-country front line health workers and underpinning a fractured health system in Sierra Leone. 
	""The UK's aim is to provide the very best life-saving health service under the most challenging conditions."" 
	The letterÂ also urges staff to check their organisation's leave policy and states that initial help is required from those with past experience but as the situation develops those with more generic skills will be welcomed. 
	The West AfricaÂ outbreak has so far killed more than 2,600 people and infected around twice as many since March."
2014-09-20,Unwanted Horses In Fly Grazing 'Crisis',https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140920185125/http://news.sky.com/story/1339023/unwanted-horses-in-fly-grazing-crisis,"By Adele Robinson, Sky News Reporter The number of horses suffering because of illegal fly grazing is rising in England, animal welfare charities say. 
	The practice involves leaving horses on someone else's land unlawfully, without their permission. 
	A report, released in conjunction with a number of charities including Blue Cross, reveals at least 3,000 horses are being fly grazed. 
	RSPCAÂ superintendent John Grant says it's becoming worse, partly in response to the declining horse meat market. 
	""The equine market has dropped. When there used to be a bit of a meat trade, people could move them on, but at the moment people are giving colts to each other. It means there's nowhere for them to go so they just dump them on whatever grazing's available."" 
	It has been described as a ""crisis"" with not enough re-homing centres to cope with the influx of abandoned horses. 
	Vicky Alford, from the Blue Cross centre in Burford in Oxfordshire, says many fly grazing horses are severely neglected, and some have to be put down. 
	""We see them in pretty poor conditions, in some cases, really quite emaciated. We see worm burdens on these horses, lice, and if horses are quite skinny then the rain can pool and puddle on their backs which can lead to some really nasty sores."" 
	The problem has become expensive for landowners, local authorities, and enforcement agencies. 
	Charities are calling for new powers, like those used in Wales, giving more control to local authorities for earlier intervention. 
	Lee Hackett, director of policy at the British Horse Society, says there have been positive ongoing talks with the Government: 
	""If we don't get this legislation through things will continue to get worse. One thing I think is really important is last year we had a mild winter, if this winter is harsh we could be in real trouble, so to be honest this legislation not going through is not an option."" 
	Parliament will debate possible changes in October. 
	The Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) says it is working to bring in additional enforcement measures."
2014-09-20,Was This The Rehabilitation Of Gordon Brown?,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140920185125/http://news.sky.com/story/1338658/was-this-the-rehabilitation-of-gordon-brown,"By Faisal Islam, Political Editor An important subplot of this week's constitutional convulsions was the role of former prime minister Gordon Brown. 
	Although it appears he was parachuted in to help the No campaign after the late-August Salmond surge, the rapprochement between Mr Brown and his former colleague and antagonist Alistair Darling occurred months ago. He always was going to play a significant role. 
	In those months Mr Brown had regularly pleaded with Conservatives to firm up an offer for maximal devolution to bring home the No vote. 
	The Conservatives resisted. 
	While the polls showed a 20 point lead under Mr Darling, why would they offer such gifts? 
	But when the polls tightened after the second debate, with Labour voters tempted by a promise of a Scotland free of Tory rule forever, Mr Brown took control. 
	It was essentially an insurance policy. A premium paid in the form of a promise and then a vow, against even a small risk of the unthinkable break up of the union. 
	And Mr Brown knew that Downing Street would pay it. A set, tight timetable for more devolution of tax and spending powers, achieved by aligning the core of three unionist parties' devolution plans. Draft legislation by Burns Night in January. 
	Mr Brown has long form for championing extra powers for Scotland stretching back to his student days. 
	It gave credibility to a vague promise. 
	And most importantly the SNP found it difficult to attack him too much. 
	As one senior SNP member puts it: ""We can't attack Gordon Brown - all we can say is 'he's a good man, but he's got this one wrong."" Mr Brown announced the timetable and the powers, and within hours Downing Street and the other parties signed up to the deal. 
	This was no ploy from Mr Brown. He was achieving, through deployment of his Scottish political capital in an electoral crisis, some of the constitutional reforms he had hoped to achieve as prime minister. 
	When I spoke to him on Wednesday, I asked him why the rest of Britain should accept this. 
	""The change I propose to the leaders of the parties is not at the expense of the rest of the UK,"" he said. 
	""The regions and the nations in the rest of the UK I think will be quite happy with these changes. 
	""And I think the offer must be open to them, if they wish to pursue the path of further devolution then that is a good thing to do. What we are admitting is that the old UK constitution which was uniform, unitary, centralised, Westminster sovereignty undiluted, that's all going."" 
	And what about even the maintenance of the Barnett formula for public spending? 
	""This is not at the expense of equity for the regions and nations of the UK. Scotland is not asking for anything at the expense of these regions and nations. But the centralising tendencies in London will have to change,"" he told me. 
	Above all Mr Brown regained his political class, the return of a heavyweight prize fighter out of semi-retirement. 
	His speeches displayed the passion of his peak powers as Chancellor in the early 2000s. His final conference speech at Maryhill Community centre could be remembered as one of the greats. The only thing we missed: the opportunity to see him slug it out in debate with Mr Salmond. 
	His motivation was singular, he told me. 
	I asked him if he was enjoying his return to the centre of the debate. ""I'd left frontline politics, I have entered this campaign for one reason only, because I was thinking about my children's future,"" he said. 
	""My children are brought up in Scotland, at school in Scotland. Given this choice could affect their future and their children's future, so someone like me as a father and a parent could not afford to be out of this debate. But I have no desire to be back in frontline politics."" 
	His ideas will now condition a British devolution revolution for at least six months. Much mocked for his accidental claim to have ""saved the world"" in the aftermath of the financial crisis, Mr Brown can now certainly lay claim to having helped save the Union."
2014-09-20,Leaders Face Pressure Over Power Pledges,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140920185125/http://news.sky.com/story/1338174/leaders-face-pressure-over-power-pledges,"By Jon Craig, Chief Political Correspondent David Cameron is facing an angry backlash from Conservative MPs over last-minute ""bribes"" that helped secure a No vote in Scotland's referendum. 
	Even normally loyal Tory backbenchers are alarmed at the promises of further devolution and more cash for Scotland made by the Prime Minister, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg. 
	There is enormous relief in the high command of the three main Westminster parties this morning. A Yes vote would have been a disaster for all three party leaders. 
	Mr Cameron was facing calls to resign from some Tory MPs who were poised to denounce him as ""the Prime Minister who lost the Union"" and blamed him for a lacklustre No campaign. 
	Labour will be mightily relieved to have avoided a Yes vote that would have robbed the party of around 40 Scottish MPs at Westminster, which would have made it difficult to form a government in future without the support of smaller parties. 
	The three party leaders at Westminster now face the tough task of implementing the promises of more devolution, more taxpayers' money and more control over NHS spending which they made in the final days of the referendum campaign. 
	Mr Cameron is also facing demands from some of his MPs to match the Scottish devolution pledge by creating an English Parliament, a move he has so far rejected. 
	There is anger among some Tories, too, at the way Mr Cameron appeared to be dragged into his pledge of more devolution by his Labour predecessor as prime minister, Gordon Brown. 
	Mr Brown's dramatic return to frontline politics, late in the referendum campaign, has split Labour MPs. Some are delighted by his comeback, but some close to to Ed Miliband are wary about his return, fearing he has overshadowed the Labour leader. 
	Now the referendum is over, senior politicians on both sides of the battle will be hoping the wounds can swiftly be healed after reports of intimidation and bullying in recent weeks. 
	At the same time, even though the result was a No vote, Labour and the Conservatives will now embark on a potentially brutal inquest into why the Better Together campaign came so close to being defeated. 
	Mr Cameron will face criticism for rejecting calls early on to allow a second question on the ballot paper, the so-called DevoÂ Max, offering further devolution. 
	The Prime Minister's critics claim the last-minute offer, contained in ""The Vow"" from the three party leaders in Scotland's Daily Record earlier this week, goes further than Mr Cameron was being urged to offer a year or so ago. 
	The legislation will probably go through Parliament, since all three main party leaders are backing it, even though there's little time before the General Election. But the Tory backlash will be damaging for Mr Cameron in the run-up to the General Election, distracting from his efforts to focus on the economy. 
	And then there's the impact of this referendum on the next one promised by Mr Cameron: an in-out vote in 2017 on Britain's membership of the EU. The fright he has had in Scotland will make him extremely nervous about that poll."

What is DevoÂ Max? 
	Scottish Parliament basically gets power over everything - apart from defence and foreign affairs. Maximum devolution. 
Is that on offer? 
	No it's not, although some say David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband have come close to that. 
What powers does Scotland already have? 
	It makes its own laws on health, education, law and order, environment, social services, housing, local government, tourism, agriculture, forestry, fisheries and some areas of transport. It can also raise or lower its income tax by 3p, but has not used this power. 
What does Westminster have control of? 
	Defence, social security, immigration, benefits, foreign policy, employment, broadcasting, trade and industry, nuclear energy, oil, gas and electricity, consumer affairs and the constitution. 
What powers will be given away in this quasi Devo Max deal? 
	It is not entirely clear. More power over setting income tax is definitely on the agenda, and control of housing benefits too. Holyrood is unlikely to get control over the oil take or corporation tax. 
Under Gordon Brown's 12-point plan, giveaways include power over borrowing, job creation, social care and employment rights. The Scottish Parliament will also be confirmed as permanent, binding future governments to ensure its continued existence. 
But what about England, Wales and Northern Ireland? 
	Well, Mr Cameron has also promised more powers for Wales and Northern Ireland and to listen to the ""millions of voices of England"". He has promised to address the problem of ""English votes for English laws"" or the West Lothian question as it is also called.Â  
	At the moment Scotland's 59Â MPs can vote on matters that affect all of the UK but English MPs cannot vote on Scottish matters where powers have been devolved to Holyrood.Â  
	With the promise of new powers for Scotland's Parliament, it has led to calls of ""unfair"" and for England to get more powers and the Prime Minister has said he will deliver. A sort of devolution revolution, if you will.Â  
	Leader of the House of Commons William Hague is in charge of drawing up these plans but do expect that the Lib Dems and Labour will have rival versions. No cross-party consensus has been reached as with devolved powers for Scotland. 
	Make no mistake, it's a major shake-up - and yes, it will be an election issue. 
So when is all this going to happen? 
	Gordon Brown has tabled a House of Commons debate over his planned 12-point power giveaway and the timetable for its delivery in mid-October. 
	There intention is that a new draft law to be drawn up by January 25 (Burns Night). Alex Salmond has agreed to talks to thrash out the details of these new powers but he will clearly be trying to get as close to delivering Devo Max as he can - having lost the battle for independence. It will not be passed until after the General Election in May but as there is a cross-party agreement theoretically, this should not provide a problem. 
	But the plans for England, Wales and Scotland do not have to work to the same timetable. They could be far more contentious as the parties are unlikely to agree on plans. Any English votes for English laws will put Labour at a distinct disadvantage as it effectively loses 40 MPs if its Scottish politicians are not included. 
	In addition, EnglishÂ MPs may be reluctant to allow new powers for Scotland to go through when they don't know ""what's in it for them"".Â  
	In short, this could get messy and take a very long time."
2014-09-20,Yes Wins Referendum's Social Media Battle,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140920185125/http://news.sky.com/story/1337925/yes-wins-referendums-social-media-battle,"The Scottish referendum has done more to re-engage a generation in politics than any hand-wringing MP or crusading campaigner. 
	Voter turnout was a record-breaking 84.5%, with 16 and 17-year-olds able to take part for the first time. 
	Minus some inevitable negativity and aggression, the level of debate has been incredibly high. 
	When I visited Scotland, I was struck by how informed people were about the different arguments - including young people who were usually switched off from Westminster. 
	One of the reasons for this engagement is social media. 
	The 2008 US election showed how politicians could use it as a campaigning tool, but it wasn't until the Scottish referendum that Britain really caught up. 
	According to Facebook, more than 10 million interactions were made about the fight in a month. 
	So who won the social media wars - and what can we learn from it? 
	The simple answer is: the Yes campaign was victorious.Â  
	The official Twitter account of the Yes campaign has an impressive 103,000 followers compared to 42,000 for Better Together. 
Alex Salmond boasts 95,000 Twitter followers and Nicola Sturgeon has 66,000 - while Alistair Darling has just 21,000. 
	On Facebook, the Yes campaign page attracted more than 320,000 likes compared to 218,000 for the No. 
	However, the fact that the Yes campaign won the social media battle should come with a health warning about reading too much into social media statistics. 
	If you want a prediction - a better bet is the bookies. 
	While supporters of independence tended to want to shout their views from the rooftops, backers of the Union were far more reticent about putting their opinions forward. 
	So it's no surprise that Yes voters were more comfortable broadcasting their views on Twitter and Facebook. 
	Campaigners from both sides managed to tap successfully into Twitter, with the Yes campaign in particular posting a whopping 1,657 photos and videos (Better Together notched up 912). 
	Many of these were clever images or videos that were deployed at key moments such as during the debates, and quickly went viral. 
	But while increased engagement on social media is a largely positive thing, there was also a dark side. 
	Like many other journalists, I have experienced aggressive tweets while covering the referendum. 
	One BBC journalist was forced to delete 400 abusive tweets from his timeline. 
	The National Union of Journalists said they have logged many incidents of offensive comments towards reporters on social media, and are considering reporting them to the police. 
	Even though the No result is known, the consequences of the outcome will take time to sink in. 
	One thing is for sure - thanks to social media, election campaigns will never be the same again."

	Lithuanian Aurimas Medvedevas, 23, had previously denied killing nine-week-old Aukse on September 5 last year. 
	The child's mother, Dzesika Urbikaite, had just had her first day back at work after maternity leave when she returned to theirÂ  home on Clifton Avenue, Peterborough, to find her baby dead in a cot. 
	Medvedevas initially claimed she had accidentally fallen out of bed. 
	Supt Jon Hutchinson, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said: ""This was a shocking, brutal crime in which a baby girl who was only nine weeks old was murdered by a person who should have been looking after her.Â  
	""He used such violence that the post-mortem examination concluded her injuries were consistent with having been in a car crash or dropped from a one-storey building. 
	""He then cruelly failed to seek the medical assistance that may well have saved her life."" 
	As well as cuts and bruises, the post mortem revealed that Aukse had two bite marks on her head. 
	She had suffered significant internal injuries including a deep cut to the liver, five rib fractures, and bleeding on the brain and eyes indicating that she had been shaken. 
	An examination of one of the bite marks showed it matched the defendant's teeth imprint, the court heard. 
	Medvedevas changed his plea to guilty two days into the trial. 
	Judge Timothy Pontius told the jury that they had heard his ""clear and voluntary confession of guilt"". 
	He told them: ""This is a distressing case and a tragic one. You are relieved of the burden of listening to that evidence."" 
	Medvedevas is due to be sentenced at the Old Bailey in Central London on Friday September 26."

	The detective sergeant and detective constable, both of Sussex Police, visited the woman in March 2008 over an alleged indecent assault in 1970. 
	A detective chief inspector and detective inspector with supervisory roles have also received misconduct notices, according to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. 
	IPCCÂ deputy chair, Sarah Green, said: ""The investigation is examining interactions between Sussex Police officers and the victim, and whether all lines of enquiry were properly pursued."" 
	The IPCC has taken a statement from the woman who reported the assault. 
	Investigators expect to interview the four officers involved shortly. 
	Meanwhile, a serving detective sergeant for North Yorkshire Police has also been served with a misconduct notice by the IPCC. 
	The force is being investigated over how it handled allegations made by a 15-year-old girl in 2002 about Savile. 
	The IPCC is also investigating how disclosures from a serving prisoner about one of Savile's associates, Peter Jaconelli, were handled in 2008 and 2009. 
	Ms Green added that the probe would examine whether the force's response ""was in accordance with national and force policies on crime recording, intelligence handling and dealing with victims of sexual abuse""."

	However, administrator PwC said it had failed to prevent 628 redundancies among head office and telesales staff at Phones 4u's Staffordshire offices. 
	PwC is continuing talks with other parties regarding the purchase of assets and said it planned to retain a further 400 head office staff to assist with its work. 
	It will release details of the 140 stores in the Vodafone deal on Monday. 
Phones 4u went into administration last Monday following EE's decision not to renew its contract. 
	The firm employed 5,600 workers at 560 Phones 4u stores and a further 160 concession outlets. 
	Dixons CarphoneÂ said on Wednesday it will take on the 800 staff who worked at 160 Phones 4u sites within Currys/PC World stores. 
	Now Vodafone UK has made an offer to buy 140 stores following an approach from PwC. 
	It said: ""Our offer was accepted by the administrator and we are pleased to report that approximately 900 (887) former Phones 4u employees will keep their jobs and join our dynamic retail business. 
	""Subject to court approval, we will start engaging with these employees and begin the rebranding of the stores to Vodafone as soon as possible."" 
	Store staff have been asked to remain at home while talks take place with parties interested in buying parts of the estate. 
	PwC partner Rob Hunt said: ""It is with great sadness and regret that we have today made the difficult decision to make 628 head office and telesales staff redundant. 
	""Our thoughts are with those employees at this difficult time. We will make every effort to help the affected staff, working with the Phones 4u HR team over the coming days to support employees."" 
	Various deals to rescue Phones 4u have been considered but all have stalled. 
	They included a debt-for-equity swap in which bondholders would have wiped out an estimated Â£760m of debt to reopen contract talks with EE and Vodafone. 
	EE and other network operators have been accused of a ""co-ordinated attempt to kill off"" Phones 4u - a claim they have all denied."
2014-09-20,Satellite Tech Allows For Driverless Tractors,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140920185125/http://news.sky.com/story/1338981/satellite-tech-allows-for-driverless-tractors,"By Philippa Hall, Sky News Reporter For many farmers in the UK it was this year's weather that helped give them their best harvest in living memory. 
	But in the future it will be technology that helps them get the most from every acre. 
	With the global population predicted to be nine billion by 2050, experts believe we will need to produce 70% more food. 
	Edd Banks is one of the growing number of farmers in the UK now practising precision farming. 
	Planting next year's wheat crop he knows exactly how much seed is going on each bit of land. 
	Everything is controlled via GPS and satellite and he uses a paperless system where his employees are sent work plans on their smartphones, which in turn report back the start and finish times. 
	Using the latest technology on his combine he creates yield maps for each field and his software in the office also records the different soil types and nutrients across his whole farm. 
	From this he creates a seed map per field - so his driller automatically varies the rate it plants, aiming for a uniform crop. 
	He said: ""If you were driving that tractor by eye, you would probably overlap by anywhere up to 20cm. 
	""We're now overlapping by 2.5cm, and that's reliably all day long."" 
	He uses Real Time Kinematics which triangulates the tractor signal with a satellite and a permanent base station on the ground. 
	There is no drift when the earth rotates which means whether he's planting, harvesting or spraying his tractors wheels will be on the same track for years to come. 
	It means farmers can save money on fuel, chemicals and seeds and they are less tired. 
	He said: ""We're no longer concentrating on driving straight, looking at the machine, driving straight. 
	""You can operate that machine better, for longer periods of time, and more accurately."" 
	Advocates of the system all claim there's also a benefit to the environment. 
	Professor Simon Blackmore, head of engineering at agricultural university Harper Adams, told Sky News: ""The ultimate goal of what we're trying to do is 'what is the minimum amount of energy that we can put into the natural environment to turn it into productive agriculture?' 
	""We can work with nature a lot better than we are doing at the moment."" 
	Manufacturers are already working on one man controlling two tractors, even tractors with no cab at all which are monitored from a central station. 
	And there are smaller autonomous robots being developed that can selectively pick ripe fruit. 
	Despite the technology and spending more time in the office than his dad -Â  Edd Banks says he still feels like a farmer."
2014-09-20,England Wins Right To Host Euro 2020 Final,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140920185125/http://news.sky.com/story/1338622/england-wins-right-to-host-euro-2020-final,"By Paul Kelso, Sports Correspondent Wembley will host the final and semi-finals of the 2020 European Championships, Uefa has announced. 
	Hampden Park in Glasgow and the Aviva Stadium in Dublin will host three group matches and a last-16 tie in the tournament, which for the first time is being played in cities across the continent rather than being hosted by one or two countries. 
	The result of the vote by members of Uefa's executive committee brought disappointment to Cardiff, with the Millennium Stadium overlooked in favour of Hampden. 
	Uefa's desire to spread the tournament around Europe meant only two of Ireland, Scotland and Wales would get games, with the Welsh missing out. 
	Emphasising the geographic split of the tournament, Baku in Azerbaijan and St Petersburg will both host quarter-finals. 
	The Wembley games will be the first time England has hosted the finals of a major tournament since Euro 1996, when England reached the semi-final. 
	Wembley has been rebuilt since then and has become a favoured venue for Uefa, staging the Champions League final twice in three seasons. 
	Uefa president Michel Platini said: ""I know the party side of London, the way the English welcome people. Wembley will doubtless live up to the responsibility."" 
	FA chairman Greg Dyke said:Â  ""We are delighted - it's nice to win one! Wembley is a great stadium and we are delighted to be holding the finals of this tournament."" 
	He added England have a ""good young side at the moment"" and said the prospect of a final on home soil is a ""great ambition"" and an ""incentive"". 
	England had failed with bids for the 2006 World Cup and 2018 World Cup. 
	Wembley was awarded the games after its only rival, Munich, withdrew before the vote by Uefa's executive committee, following a deal between the English and German football associations. 
	The FA agreed to back Germany's expected bid for Euro 2024 in exchange for support in the Euro 2020 vote. 
	Wembley's chances of success were also boosted when the FA dropped its bid for the next Women's under-17 World Cup, leaving France, home of Mr Platini, the favourite among European nations. 
	Munich will host three group games and a quarter-final, as will Rome. 
	The remaining group matches and last-16 games will be staged in Copenhagen, Bucharest, Budapest, Amsterdam, Bilbao and Brussels."
2014-09-20,Scotland Votes No: PM Promises New Powers,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140920185125/http://news.sky.com/story/1338424/scotland-votes-no-pm-promises-new-powers,"David Cameron has promised new powers for Scotland as 55% of the country voted to reject independence. 
	However, he warned that it was time the ""millions of voices of England"" were heard as he unveiled a substantial shake-up for the whole of the UK with new powers for Wales and Northern Ireland and greater influence for England's MPs over English law. 
	The Prime Minister was speaking outside No 10 after Alex SalmondÂ accepted defeat in the historic referendum, with 44% voting in favour of independence. 
Scotland's First Minister later announced he was stepping down from the position, despite claiming the country was the real winner following the referendum. 
	Mr Cameron said the new powers he, Nick CleggÂ and Ed Miliband had promised Scotland in the dying days of campaigning would be ""honoured in full"". 
	And he said work would start on a ""full and fair settlement for all of the UK"" in what appeared to be a shift towards a more federalist UK and that plans would be drawn up by the Leader of the House of Commons, William Hague. 
	Labour dismissed Mr Cameron's plans as ""knee-jerk"" and Mr MilibandÂ set out his own proposal for a Constitutional Convention and political reform of Westminster as he arrived for the Labour Party conference in Manchester. 
	He said: ""This referendum has changed Scotland. But it will also change Britain. We know there is deep anger across the UK with Westminster politics from so many people who feel left out and left behind - that our country doesn't work for them. 
	""Labour's plan for Britain means big economic change but it also means change in the way we are governed."" 
	His proposals would see all of the UK regions producing a report on how they should be run, these recommendations would be pulled together and debated by Parliament. He said further details would be released in the coming weeks. 
	Mr Miliband is heavily reliant on his 40 Scottish MPs in influencing Commons votes and any attempt to stop them voting on English matters would be seriously damaging to Labour. 
	UKIP leader NigelÂ Farage said: ""I think what most English people want is a fair settlement."" 
	He accused Mr Cameron of cobbling together a last-minute solution: ""I don't think William Hague and a committee can work this out. I think we need a proper, open debate."" 
	Speaking after his dream of breaking up the 307-year-old Union was shattered, Mr Salmond said that ""Scotland will expect these (new powers) to be honoured in rapid course."" 
	Some politicians called for the immediate recall of Parliament to discuss the Prime Minister's proposals. 
	However, Mr Hague said recalling Parliament would be disruptive to imminent party conferences, but he said the Government would be open to the views of MPs. 
	Northern Ireland First Minister Peter Robinson was due to discuss the impact of the Scottish vote on powers for his country and for Wales. He said England, Wales and Northern Ireland should get the same deal as Scotland to the same timetable.Â  
	Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones said the ""old Union we know is dead"". In a speech in which he was highly critical of Mr Cameron's handling of the Scottish referendum, he said it was time to sit together and work it out. 
	He said: ""The UK has suffered a serious injury and a sticking plaster will not do."" 
	The Queen was expected to give a statement on the outcome of the referendum, which saw the pound and markets rally, later today. 
	The result of the vote, which saw a record 84% turnout, has left a country divided, with Yes victories in Dundee and the nation's largest city Glasgow. 
	Politicians and religious leaders urged Scotland, where communities and even households had been split over the vote, to come together and work for the future. Mr Salmond said: ""I accept the verdict and I expect all people to follow suit.""

	The first ministers have called for talks to work out the future of the United Kingdom in the wake of a Scottish referendum which saw voters reject independence but win a raft of new powers. 
	David Cameron has promised a wide-ranging shake-up of the way the UK is run with more powers for Wales and Northern Ireland and greater influence over English laws for English MPs. 
	However, while he has pledged new powers promised at the tail end of the referendum campaign will be delivered for the Scottish by January 25 no timescale has been set for England, Wales and Northern Ireland. 
	Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones, who was highly critical of Mr Cameronâs handling of the referendum, said: ""The old Union we know is dead. 
	""We need to forge a new one, but no more committees, no more messing about, no more panicky deals - it's time to sit together, all of us as four nations, and work this through. 
	""The UK has suffered a serious injury and a sticking plaster will not do."" 
	London mayor Boris Johnson, who is hoping to return to Westminster in the General Election, said he did not agree the UK was dead saying: ""I think the Union is well."" 
	He has said English MPs do need more of a say but added that it needed to be sorted out in ""a way that is fair"". 
	Northern Irelandâs Peter Robinson said: ""I think there is a recognition amongst the main political parties in the UK that the present arrangements that we have in the UK, I was almost going to say theyâre not fit for purpose. 
	""But it's fairly clear that they do need to be changes in the way that takes into account the present day realities, the desire for greater self governance in various parts of the Kingdom and indeed a recognition that throws up anomalies particularly in how England itself is treated."" 
	Both have said that Scotland should not be given greater powers than the rest of the UK. However, full details of the powers to be devolved have not yet been given. 
	They are expected to include control of housing benefits and a greater say in the setting of income tax. 
	Unless adequate proposals for England, Northern Ireland and Wales are put forward by the Government then it has been suggested the draft law on devolved powers for Scotland could hit some snags. 
	Leader of the House of Commons William Hague has been put in charge of drawing up the plans for England - including the question of English votes for English laws. 
	However, Ed Miliband has dismissed Mr Cameron's proposals and moved to suggest a new Constitutional Convention by the end of 2015. 
	Under Labour's plans each region would produce a series of recommendations which would be brought together in a constitution to be debated by Parliament. 
	Mr Miliband will be keen to avoid an ""English votes for English laws"" policy because it would mean he would effectively lose 40 Scottish MPs, who can currently vote on UK matters. 
	It would significantly weaken Labour in the House of Commons."

	In three days of deliberations at Southwark Crown Court, the jury have not reached a unanimous decision.

	However, he urged: ""Try and reach a verdict on which you all agree."" 
	The 69-year-old DJ, appearing in court under his real name, David Griffin, is being retried on two of the counts after a jury was unable to reach a verdict during an earlier trial in February. 
	The third count of indecent assault relates to a new accusation from another complainant, which allegedly took place on 17 January, 1995. 
	As the judge summed up the evidence, he urged the panel to disregard accusations made about other celebrities in light of the Jimmy Savile affair. 
	Mr Leonard also warned the group to ""not allow themselves to become overawed or deflated by the interest this case has attracted"". 
	He stressed: ""The fact that the defendant is a well-known media personality does not change the rules of this case.""

	Britain's biggest supermarket chain said it has commissioned an independent review to uncover the cause of the profit miscalculation. 
	Tesco said in a statement: ""On the basis of preliminary investigations in to the UK food business, the board believes that the guidance issued on 29 August 2014 for the group profits for the six months to 23 August 2014 was overstated by an estimated Â£250m. 
	""Some of this impact includes in-year timing differences. Work is ongoing to establish the extent of these issues and what impact they will have on the full year. 
	""The board has asked Deloitte to undertake an independent and comprehensive review of these issues, working closely with Freshfields, the group's external legal advisers. 
	""We will provide a further update at our interim results, which will now be announced on the 23 October 2014."" 
	Tesco has issued a series of income warnings in the last year, with the latest at the end of August when it said trading profit was forecast to be around Â£1.1bn. 
	That profit figure is now likely to be reduced to Â£850m. 
	Sky News City Editor Mark Kleinman described the accounting error as a ""humiliation"" for the embattled group. 
	Regulators are now expected to launch their own inquiries into the profit over-estimation. 
	Last November, an analyst at stockbroker Cantor Fitzgerald accused Tesco of squeezing suppliers ahead of release of lacklustre trading figures. 
	The company denied the claim and said the assertions of demanding money from suppliers' trading accounts were ""based on speculation"". 
	Tesco has come under increasing pressure in the ongoing supermarket price war, with the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl, and margin-squeezing of the big four chains. 
	Chief executive Dave Lewis, who started in the role on September 1, said: ""We have uncovered a serious issue and have responded accordingly."" 
	Mr Lewis took control of Tesco after former boss Philip Clarke failed to halt a slide in profit and sales. 
	Mr Clarke was ousted by the Tesco board in late July as he was preparing to celebrate 40 years with the retailer."
2014-09-22,Tesco Profit Error: Could Something Be Amiss?,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140922194724/http://news.sky.com/story/1340272/tesco-profit-error-could-something-be-amiss,"By Ian King, Business Presenter Even from a lesser company, three profits warnings inside a year would be startling. 
	Coming from a blue-chip stalwart like Tesco, it is nothing short of astonishing. 
	In issuing a profits warning on top of a profits warning, Britainâs biggest food retailer almost seems to be taking to an extreme the strategy so commonly seen in its stores, with three for the price of two. 
	So what exactly has Dave Lewis, the new chief executive, uncovered? 
	Well, in its own words, Tesco has identified an overstatement of its expected profit for the half year, principally due to the accelerated recognition of commercial income and delayed accrual of costs. 
	In other words, the reporting of costs incurred in the first half of the year appears to have been delayed so they are pushed into the second half, while profits enjoyed during the second half of the year appear to have been brought forward into the first half. 
	It is unclear what kind of activities generated these profits but commercial income, with regard to supermarkets, could mean rebates from third-party suppliers or payments from those suppliers to incentivise Tesco to give their goods better positions when they are displayed in its stores. 
	This latter practice is common place in the supermarket sector and, having worked previously at Unilever, Mr Lewis will be familiar with it. 
	The overall effect of these two actions will have been to pretty up Tescoâs first-half numbers. 
	Cynics will suggest Mr Lewis has every reason to restate the numbers lower - after all, the period, the six months to August 23, was when his predecessor, Philip Clarke, was at the helm. 
	Some would say it is in Mr Lewisâs interests to ensure that period is painted in as bad a light as possible in order to make any subsequent turnaround under him look better. 
	Itâs known as ""kitchen sinking"" in the City - where every possible bad bit of news, including the proverbial kitchen sink, is thrown into the accounts to make them look bad. 
	But the sheer size of this overstatement, Â£250m, would suggest this is a bit more serious. 
	So is Mr Lewis' response: the suspension of four of Tesco's UK executives, his recruitment of the top City lawyers Freshfields to investigate and his hiring of outside auditors from Deloitte - Tescoâs regular auditor is PwC - to examine what has happened. 
	At this time, there is no suggestion that anything illegal has been happening. After all, all businesses occasionally recognise revenues early or take their time to recognise costs in the accounts. 
	Yet the sheer aggression of the accounting policy in this instance and Mr Lewis' response to discovering it rather suggests he thinks something may be amiss. 
	And, with plenty of American investors - who tend to be more litigious than their European counterparts - on Tesco's shareholder base,Â  he is doing the prudent thing in checking this out as thoroughly as possible."

	The remains were discovered on land behind Healey Conservative Club in Whitworth, near Rochdale, shortly before 2.45pm on Sunday. 
	Officers said that although a formal identification had not yet taken place, police believe there is a ""strong possibility"" that the body is that of Heath Nield. 
	Mr Nield went missing from his home in Rochdale Road, Bacup, in July. 
	Lancashire Police say it appears to have been there for some time and is badly decomposed. 
	There is no indication of the sex or age of the body.

	A further 720 staff have been retained to assist with the closure programme, administrators PwC said following talks with employees. 
	It comes after Phones 4U went into administration last week following a decision by both EE and VodafoneÂ not to renew contracts. 
	Rob Hunt, joint administrator and PwC partner, said: ""It is with much regret that we have today made the difficult decision to close a large number of stores. 
	""It is a very sad day for the staff working at those locations and our thoughts are with them. 
	""We will make every effort to help the affected staff, working with the Phones 4U HR team over the coming days to support employees."" 
	Breakdowns of stores closing will be available on Tuesday, administrators said. 
	Sky News has learnt that the owner of Carphone Warehouse is to press ahead on Tuesday with an attempt to salvage hundreds of jobs at Phones 4U despite administrators' move to axe the stores. 
	Dixons Carphone plans to make a statement on Tuesday that it remains interested in acquiring between 50 and 100 shops from the ailing mobile phone retailer's estate. 
	On Monday, EE said it would buy 58 Phones 4U stores - saving more than 350 jobs. 
	VodafoneÂ have purchased another 140 stores, safeguarding 887 jobs. 
	Entrepreneur John Caudwell, who set up the operation in the 1980s before selling it for Â£1.5 billion in 2006, called the behaviour of the networks ""extremely callous, extremely ruthless"". 
	VodafoneÂ has rejected anyÂ suggestion that it acted inappropriately during negotiations withÂ Phones 4U. 
	It indicated that the private equity-owned firm's debt repayment schedule hampered the discussions. 
	EE said its decision not to renew its contract was in part driven by uncertainty over the long-term viability of Phones 4U. 
	Its withdrawal left the retailer without a single network partner."
2014-09-22,Alice Gross: Canal Searched In Hunt For Teen,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140922194724/http://news.sky.com/story/1340000/alice-gross-canal-searched-in-hunt-for-teen,"Police have asked officials in Latvia for the case file of Arnis Zalkalns, the prime suspect in the disappearance of teenager Alice Gross, as they search a canal close to where she was last seen. 
	The hunt for the 14-year-old, who went missing in west London on August 28, is the biggest search operation since the 7/7 bombings in 2005. 
	Search teams are wading through HanwellÂ canal, using a dinghy and a search dog, and carefully combing surrounding land. 
	Zalkalns, a Latvian national, has been named as the main suspect by police after he, too, went missing from his home, in Ealing on September 3. 
	Sky's Crime Correspondent Martin Brunt says police have denied they linked the builder with the case only after a reporter made the connection. 
	He said: ""The Yard are also saying that it has known about this suspect, had an interest in him, Mr Zalkalns, for perhaps a couple of weeks and they have had some formal discussions with the Latvian authorities."" 
	A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ""We are maintaining a close and productive relationship with the Latvian authorities in relation to this investigation. We are not going to elaborate on the nature of information sharing with Latvian authorities."" 
	It has emerged that the 41-year-old was jailed in his native country in the late 1990s for murdering his wife and burying her in a forest after a dispute about her sexuality. 
	He was also arrested in London five years ago on suspicion of indecent assault on a 14-year-old girl, but was never charged. 
	Zalkalns' ex-girlfriend has told The Daily Telegraph he was accused of drugging and molesting the girl. 
	Search teams, including dogs and divers, have been deployed across west London looking for Alice, who is from Hanwell. 
	Some 630 officers from eight police forces have been involved. 
	They have searched 25 square kilometres (9.6 square miles) of open land and 5.5km of canals and rivers. 
	Scotland Yard insist they have no evidence to suggest that Alice, who suffers from anorexia, has come to harm. 
	On Friday, police recovered a bicycle belonging to ZalkalnsÂ after searching one of his former homes in Hanwell. 
	Zalkalns has not accessed his bank account or used his mobile phone since September 3, nor has he returned home to his partner and young child. 
	His passport was left at his house and police in Latvia have confirmed he has not entered the country by plane. 
	They have however acknowledged it is possible he could have got in undetected if he travelled by car or coach. 
	Zalkalns was seen on CCTV footage cycling along a path by the Grand Union Canal 15 minutes after the last sighting of Alice. 
	Detectives believe he is likely to have seen Alice as they were both going north along the canal towpath."
2014-09-22,Balls: 'We Have Learnt From Our Mistakes',https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140922194724/http://news.sky.com/story/1339787/balls-we-have-learnt-from-our-mistakes,"Ed Balls insisted Labour had learned from its mistakes as he set out plans that would see politicians' pay cut, a bank levy to pay for free childcare and a child-benefit freeze. 
	In an attempt to show the party could be trusted with the economy, the shadow chancellor said he would not ""duck"" the tough decisions and hinted at fresh welfare cuts. 
	He said he believed in tax cuts for the ""millions not the millionaires"", pushing forward a 50p income tax rate for those earning more thanÂ Â£150,000. 
	And he said any extra money would be pumped into the NHS, which Labour would have to save from the Tories again when it returned to power after the 2015 election. 
	In a speech to the Labour Party Conference in Manchester, Mr Balls hit out at the ""unfair, out-of-touch and failing Tory Government"", pledging to raise the minimum wage and scrap the so-called bedroom tax. 
	However, he earned groans from delegates when he said the benefits cap would remain as he laid out precisely how a Labour government would ""balance the books"". 
	New free schools would be blocked in areas where there was an excess of pupil places, police and crime commissioners would be scrapped and the controversial ""shares for rights"" scheme, which allows workers to give up some rights such as unfair dismissal in return for shares, ditched. 
	He also took the opportunity to thank Alistair Darling, Jim Murphy and a host of other Labour names for their efforts on the Scottish Referendum campaign trail - but, crucially, failed to namecheck Gordon Brown. 
	Mr Brown gave what commentators called the ""speech of his political life"" in the dying days of the campaign, which has been credited with providing a significant boost to the Better Together campaign. 
	The shadow chancellor presented a 1% cap on rises for the first two years of a Labour government, which would raise Â£400m, as one of the ""tough decisions"" needed to deal with the deficit if the party takes power next year. 
	But he attempted to show that politicians were expected to shoulder their share of the Â£75bn deficit burden by announcing a 5% cut in ministerial salaries - taking Â£7,125 off the Prime Minister's annual wage and Â£6,728 from Cabinet ministers. 
	Mr Balls insisted: ""We are tough enough to make the difficult decisions. We won't spend money we can't afford."" 
	He apologised for the party's past mistakes, including over immigration. He indicated they would put it right with tougher rules on immigrants claiming benefits and on bank regulation. 
	However, he said: ""Itâs the oldest truth in the book - you can never, ever trust the Tories with the NHS. 
	""We donât just need to learn from our mistakes, we also need to put right mistakes this Government is making."" 
	He pledged Labour would not ""walk away from Europe"" and said the party had learned from its past and mistakes. 
	Sky's Deputy Political Editor Joey Jones said Mr Balls was ""wheeling out a whole sheaf of policies that have been announced over past months/years."" 
	The speech earned Mr Balls a pat on the back from Ed Miliband. During the speech, Mr Balls praised him as a fine leader and ""the next prime minister of the UK"". 
	The leader of the Unite union, Len McCluskey, said freezing child benefit was not the ""cleverest tactic"" as he disclosed the union had yet to decide what it would contribute to the party's election war chest. 
	He told BBC Radio 4: ""We want our party to go into the election not with one arm tied behind its back because the Tories' coffers are spilling over with money from the super rich and the corporate elite. 
	""We want it to be an even fight but we haven't spoken about the specific numbers."" 
The party also has plans to raise the minimum wage to Â£8 an hour, and introduce a jobs guarantee for young people and the long-term unemployed funded by a tax on bank bonuses and limiting pensions tax relief for the highest earners. 
	Treasury Exchequer Secretary Priti Patel poured scorn on Mr Balls' plan for the economy, claiming Labour would put the deficit up, not down. 
	The Children's Society said Labour's plans to freeze child benefit would leave the average family more than Â£400 a year worse off by 2017 and urged the shadow chancellor to reconsider."

	""You lost the argument, you lost the referendum, you have lost office and now you have lost the plot,"" declared Mr Darling during a celebration of the No vote in the referendum. 
	The angry outburst from the normally mild-mannered former Labour chancellor came 24 hours after Mr Salmond said on Sky'sÂ Murnaghan programme that Scotland could declare independence without holding another referendum. 
	Mr Darling was speaking as leading Labour figures from Scotland gathered on the conference platform for a victory celebration and were congratulated by Ed Miliband. 
	The one major figure missing was Gordon Brown, hailed by many as the saviour of the union, and the Labour leader did not mention him in his brief speech, although the former Prime Minister's closest ally, Ed Balls, paid tribute to Mr Brown in his conference speech later. 
	In his controversial threat to go it alone, Mr Salmond told Sky News: ""There are a whole range of ways Scotland can improve its position in pursuit of Scottish independence. 
	""I think that's going to happen. I mean when you have a situation where the majority of a country up to the age of 55 is already voting for independence, then I think the writing is on the wall for Westminster. 
	Mr Salmond said while he was in favour of a referendum for many years there had been a ""gradualist"" attitude to independence. 
	""That is to say you establish a parliament, you establish successively more powers until you have a situation where you're independent in all but name and he presumably you declare yourself to be independent,"" he added. 
	""Many countries have proceeded through that route."""

	The shape of the trail - which turns one way, then quickly back again - suggests the plane it came from made a sudden detour as it flew over Hampshire. 
	Teacher Florence Lehmann spotted it as she left her home in Southsea at about 7.20am. 
	Miss Lehmann said: ""It's really weird. It looks like the pilot sneezed or fell asleep. Somebody said a UFO had been spotted recently in the area and the pilot had tried to avoid it, which I quite like the sound of. 
	""There was no wind this morning and the plane actually moved trajectory."" 
	A spokeswoman for Nats, the air traffic control company, said she could not explain why the plane changed direction. 
	She said: ""Unfortunately Nats has no knowledge of the purpose of any given flight and we do not identify individual aircraft to members of the public.""

	The bus and the car ended up on their sides in a field. 
	Northern Ireland Ambulance Service spokesman John McPoland said: ""Fifty-two people were treated at the scene but none of their injuries were serious. The vast majority were checked as a precaution because of their age. 
	""Six people have slightly more than minor injuries. This would include children who banged their heads off the bus windows but no one went through any windows."" 
	A total of 48 people have been taken to the South West Acute Hospital and Altnagelvin Hospital. 
	Omagh Road has been closed between Segully Road and Drumrawan Road. 
	The bus was travelling from Castlederg to a secondary school in Omagh.

2014-09-22,Was This The Rehabilitation Of Gordon Brown?,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140922194724/http://news.sky.com/story/1338658/was-this-the-rehabilitation-of-gordon-brown,"By Faisal Islam, Political Editor An important subplot of this week's constitutional convulsions was the role of former prime minister Gordon Brown. 
	Although it appears he was parachuted in to help the No campaign after the late-August Salmond surge, the rapprochement between Mr Brown and his former colleague and antagonist Alistair Darling occurred months ago. He always was going to play a significant role. 
	In those months Mr Brown had regularly pleaded with Conservatives to firm up an offer for maximal devolution to bring home the No vote. 
	The Conservatives resisted. 
	While the polls showed a 20 point lead under Mr Darling, why would they offer such gifts? 
	But when the polls tightened after the second debate, with Labour voters tempted by a promise of a Scotland free of Tory rule forever, Mr Brown took control. 
	It was essentially an insurance policy. A premium paid in the form of a promise and then a vow, against even a small risk of the unthinkable break up of the union. 
	And Mr Brown knew that Downing Street would pay it. A set, tight timetable for more devolution of tax and spending powers, achieved by aligning the core of three unionist parties' devolution plans. Draft legislation by Burns Night in January. 
	Mr Brown has long form for championing extra powers for Scotland stretching back to his student days. 
	It gave credibility to a vague promise. 
	And most importantly the SNP found it difficult to attack him too much. 
	As one senior SNP member puts it: ""We can't attack Gordon Brown - all we can say is 'he's a good man, but he's got this one wrong."" Mr Brown announced the timetable and the powers, and within hours Downing Street and the other parties signed up to the deal. 
	This was no ploy from Mr Brown. He was achieving, through deployment of his Scottish political capital in an electoral crisis, some of the constitutional reforms he had hoped to achieve as prime minister. 
	When I spoke to him on Wednesday, I asked him why the rest of Britain should accept this. 
	""The change I propose to the leaders of the parties is not at the expense of the rest of the UK,"" he said. 
	""The regions and the nations in the rest of the UK I think will be quite happy with these changes. 
	""And I think the offer must be open to them, if they wish to pursue the path of further devolution then that is a good thing to do. What we are admitting is that the old UK constitution which was uniform, unitary, centralised, Westminster sovereignty undiluted, that's all going."" 
	And what about even the maintenance of the Barnett formula for public spending? 
	""This is not at the expense of equity for the regions and nations of the UK. Scotland is not asking for anything at the expense of these regions and nations. But the centralising tendencies in London will have to change,"" he told me. 
	Above all Mr Brown regained his political class, the return of a heavyweight prize fighter out of semi-retirement. 
	His speeches displayed the passion of his peak powers as Chancellor in the early 2000s. His final conference speech at Maryhill Community centre could be remembered as one of the greats. The only thing we missed: the opportunity to see him slug it out in debate with Mr Salmond. 
	His motivation was singular, he told me. 
	I asked him if he was enjoying his return to the centre of the debate. ""I'd left frontline politics, I have entered this campaign for one reason only, because I was thinking about my children's future,"" he said. 
	""My children are brought up in Scotland, at school in Scotland. Given this choice could affect their future and their children's future, so someone like me as a father and a parent could not afford to be out of this debate. But I have no desire to be back in frontline politics."" 
	His ideas will now condition a British devolution revolution for at least six months. Much mocked for his accidental claim to have ""saved the world"" in the aftermath of the financial crisis, Mr Brown can now certainly lay claim to having helped save the Union."
2014-09-22,Leaders Face Pressure Over Power Pledges,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140922194724/http://news.sky.com/story/1338174/leaders-face-pressure-over-power-pledges,"By Jon Craig, Chief Political Correspondent David Cameron is facing an angry backlash from Conservative MPs over last-minute ""bribes"" that helped secure a No vote in Scotland's referendum. 
	Even normally loyal Tory backbenchers are alarmed at the promises of further devolution and more cash for Scotland made by the Prime Minister, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg. 
	There is enormous relief in the high command of the three main Westminster parties this morning. A Yes vote would have been a disaster for all three party leaders. 
	Mr Cameron was facing calls to resign from some Tory MPs who were poised to denounce him as ""the Prime Minister who lost the Union"" and blamed him for a lacklustre No campaign. 
	Labour will be mightily relieved to have avoided a Yes vote that would have robbed the party of around 40 Scottish MPs at Westminster, which would have made it difficult to form a government in future without the support of smaller parties. 
	The three party leaders at Westminster now face the tough task of implementing the promises of more devolution, more taxpayers' money and more control over NHS spending which they made in the final days of the referendum campaign. 
	Mr Cameron is also facing demands from some of his MPs to match the Scottish devolution pledge by creating an English Parliament, a move he has so far rejected. 
	There is anger among some Tories, too, at the way Mr Cameron appeared to be dragged into his pledge of more devolution by his Labour predecessor as prime minister, Gordon Brown. 
	Mr Brown's dramatic return to frontline politics, late in the referendum campaign, has split Labour MPs. Some are delighted by his comeback, but some close to to Ed Miliband are wary about his return, fearing he has overshadowed the Labour leader. 
	Now the referendum is over, senior politicians on both sides of the battle will be hoping the wounds can swiftly be healed after reports of intimidation and bullying in recent weeks. 
	At the same time, even though the result was a No vote, Labour and the Conservatives will now embark on a potentially brutal inquest into why the Better Together campaign came so close to being defeated. 
	Mr Cameron will face criticism for rejecting calls early on to allow a second question on the ballot paper, the so-called DevoÂ Max, offering further devolution. 
	The Prime Minister's critics claim the last-minute offer, contained in ""The Vow"" from the three party leaders in Scotland's Daily Record earlier this week, goes further than Mr Cameron was being urged to offer a year or so ago. 
	The legislation will probably go through Parliament, since all three main party leaders are backing it, even though there's little time before the General Election. But the Tory backlash will be damaging for Mr Cameron in the run-up to the General Election, distracting from his efforts to focus on the economy. 
	And then there's the impact of this referendum on the next one promised by Mr Cameron: an in-out vote in 2017 on Britain's membership of the EU. The fright he has had in Scotland will make him extremely nervous about that poll."
2014-09-22,Devo Max: What New Powers Can Scotland Have?,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140922194724/http://news.sky.com/story/1338014/devo-max-what-new-powers-can-scotland-have,"David Cameron has pledged new powers for Scotland that some have said amount to Devo Max. However, it's not quite as clear cut as that. 
What is DevoÂ Max? 
	Scottish Parliament basically gets power over everything - apart from defence and foreign affairs. Maximum devolution. 
Is that on offer? 
	No it's not, although some say David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband have come close to that. 
What powers does Scotland already have? 
	It makes its own laws on health, education, law and order, environment, social services, housing, local government, tourism, agriculture, forestry, fisheries and some areas of transport. It can also raise or lower its income tax by 3p, but has not used this power. 
What does Westminster have control of? 
	Defence, social security, immigration, benefits, foreign policy, employment, broadcasting, trade and industry, nuclear energy, oil, gas and electricity, consumer affairs and the constitution. 
What powers will be given away in this quasi Devo Max deal? 
	It is not entirely clear. More power over setting income tax is definitely on the agenda, and control of housing benefits too. Holyrood is unlikely to get control over the oil take or corporation tax. 
Under Gordon Brown's 12-point plan, giveaways include power over borrowing, job creation, social care and employment rights. The Scottish Parliament will also be confirmed as permanent, binding future governments to ensure its continued existence. 
But what about England, Wales and Northern Ireland? 
	Well, Mr Cameron has also promised more powers for Wales and Northern Ireland and to listen to the ""millions of voices of England"". He has promised to address the problem of ""English votes for English laws"" or the West Lothian question as it is also called.Â  
	At the moment Scotland's 59Â MPs can vote on matters that affect all of the UK but English MPs cannot vote on Scottish matters where powers have been devolved to Holyrood.Â  
	With the promise of new powers for Scotland's Parliament, it has led to calls of ""unfair"" and for England to get more powers and the Prime Minister has said he will deliver. A sort of devolution revolution, if you will.Â  
	Leader of the House of Commons William Hague is in charge of drawing up these plans but do expect that the Lib Dems and Labour will have rival versions. No cross-party consensus has been reached as with devolved powers for Scotland. 
	Make no mistake, it's a major shake-up - and yes, it will be an election issue. 
So when is all this going to happen? 
	Gordon Brown has tabled a House of Commons debate over his planned 12-point power giveaway and the timetable for its delivery in mid-October. 
	There intention is that a new draft law to be drawn up by January 25 (Burns Night). Alex Salmond has agreed to talks to thrash out the details of these new powers but he will clearly be trying to get as close to delivering Devo Max as he can - having lost the battle for independence. It will not be passed until after the General Election in May but as there is a cross-party agreement theoretically, this should not provide a problem. 
	But the plans for England, Wales and Scotland do not have to work to the same timetable. They could be far more contentious as the parties are unlikely to agree on plans. Any English votes for English laws will put Labour at a distinct disadvantage as it effectively loses 40 MPs if its Scottish politicians are not included. 
	In addition, EnglishÂ MPs may be reluctant to allow new powers for Scotland to go through when they don't know ""what's in it for them"".Â  
	In short, this could get messy and take a very long time."
2014-09-22,Yes Wins Referendum's Social Media Battle,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140922194724/http://news.sky.com/story/1337925/yes-wins-referendums-social-media-battle,"The Scottish referendum has done more to re-engage a generation in politics than any hand-wringing MP or crusading campaigner. 
	Voter turnout was a record-breaking 84.5%, with 16 and 17-year-olds able to take part for the first time. 
	Minus some inevitable negativity and aggression, the level of debate has been incredibly high. 
	When I visited Scotland, I was struck by how informed people were about the different arguments - including young people who were usually switched off from Westminster. 
	One of the reasons for this engagement is social media. 
	The 2008 US election showed how politicians could use it as a campaigning tool, but it wasn't until the Scottish referendum that Britain really caught up. 
	According to Facebook, more than 10 million interactions were made about the fight in a month. 
	So who won the social media wars - and what can we learn from it? 
	The simple answer is: the Yes campaign was victorious.Â  
	The official Twitter account of the Yes campaign has an impressive 103,000 followers compared to 42,000 for Better Together. 
Alex Salmond boasts 95,000 Twitter followers and Nicola Sturgeon has 66,000 - while Alistair Darling has just 21,000. 
	On Facebook, the Yes campaign page attracted more than 320,000 likes compared to 218,000 for the No. 
	However, the fact that the Yes campaign won the social media battle should come with a health warning about reading too much into social media statistics. 
	If you want a prediction - a better bet is the bookies. 
	While supporters of independence tended to want to shout their views from the rooftops, backers of the Union were far more reticent about putting their opinions forward. 
	So it's no surprise that Yes voters were more comfortable broadcasting their views on Twitter and Facebook. 
	Campaigners from both sides managed to tap successfully into Twitter, with the Yes campaign in particular posting a whopping 1,657 photos and videos (Better Together notched up 912). 
	Many of these were clever images or videos that were deployed at key moments such as during the debates, and quickly went viral. 
	But while increased engagement on social media is a largely positive thing, there was also a dark side. 
	Like many other journalists, I have experienced aggressive tweets while covering the referendum. 
	One BBC journalist was forced to delete 400 abusive tweets from his timeline. 
	The National Union of Journalists said they have logged many incidents of offensive comments towards reporters on social media, and are considering reporting them to the police. 
	Even though the No result is known, the consequences of the outcome will take time to sink in. 
	One thing is for sure - thanks to social media, election campaigns will never be the same again."
2014-09-22,Barclays Hit By Â£38m Fine Over Client Assets,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140922194724/http://news.sky.com/story/1340322/barclays-hit-by-38m-fine-over-client-assets,"By Mark Kleinman, City Editor Barclays will be hit by the latest in a string of financial penalties this week when the City regulator hands out a Â£38m fine for failing to ensure adequate protection for clients' funds. 
	Sky News has learnt that the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is to announce as soon as Tuesday that Barclays is to pay the fine - a record for this type of misconduct. 
	The punishment relates to the bank's failure to segregate clients' asset properly and maintain adequate records, the second occasion on which Barclays has been fined for such an offence after a Â£1.1m penalty three years ago. 
	The FCA is understood to have concluded that a much more severe penalty is necessary in order to serve as a deterrent to other firms which continue to demonstrate inadequate controls over clients' assets. 
	Insiders said on Monday that the regulator's announcement would make clear that losses for Barclays' clients were theoretical rather than actual. 
	The penalty imposed on Barclays is higher than a Â£33m fine with which JP Morgan was hit in 2010 for similar misconduct. 
	Regulators are determined to ensure that major banks separate clientsâ funds from their own because of the complexity of unwinding major lenders in the event of insolvency, a problem highlighted with graphic consequences when Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008. 
	The latest offences relate to multiple failings in Barclays' investment banking division over a five-year period between 2007 and 2012, prior to the appointment of Antony Jenkins as the bankâs group chief executive. 
	Mr Jenkins has made cleaning up Barclays and reaching settlements over past misconduct a priority for his leadership. 
	Since he took over from Bob Diamond in the aftermath of the bankâs Â£291m fine for rigging the interbank borrowing rate Libor, Mr Jenkins has reached deals for a range of misconduct. 
	Like other banks, it has set aside billions of pounds to compensate customers who were mis-sold payment protection insurance and interest rate hedging products. 
	Earlier this year, it agreed to pay nearly Â£30m for misconduct by one employee who attempted to rig the daily gold price-fix in London. 
	The process for setting the benchmark price of that commodity and others is now in the process of being overhauled as part of a global clean-up of financial markets. 
	Mr Jenkinsâ strategy to simplify Barclays, which includes shrinking its investment bank by cutting thousands of jobs, is beginning to show signs of paying off. 
	Earlier this month, it announced the appointment of John McFarlane, a heavyweight City figure who chairs Aviva, the insurance group, as its next chairman, which was welcomed by the City. 
	It was unclear on Monday whether Barclays would be able to claw back any payments made to former investment bank executives following the FCAâs latest fine. 
	One source said that the Â£38m figure included a 30% discount to reflect Barclaysâ co-operation with the regulator. 
	Barclays and the FCA declined to comment."

	The 13 men and women, believed to be from Ethiopia, got out of the HGV when it stopped on a hard shoulder in Chertsey, Surrey, during the morning rush hour. 
	Traffic had to be slowed between junctions 12 and 13 of the M25 as officers dealt with the incident. 
	The lorry left the scene before the police arrived, and it remains unclear whether the driver is wanted by the UK Border Agency for questioning. 
	Surrey Police said: ""Thirteen people are in custody on suspicion of immigration offences following an incident on the M25 this morning. 
	""Surrey Police received a number of calls around 8.50am from members of the public reporting that they had seen a large group of people getting out of the back of a lorry, which had stopped on the hard shoulder between junctions 11 (Chertsey) and 12 (the M3). 
	""The lorry drove off prior to officers attending the scene. 
	""However, the 13 people, including men and women, were located walking along the M25 and were arrested on suspicion of immigration offences.

2014-09-22,Dog Owner's Arm Nearly Ripped Off In Attack,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140922194724/http://news.sky.com/story/1340136/dog-owners-arm-nearly-ripped-off-in-attack,"A dog owner has almost had his arm ripped off after being mauled by two of his American Bulldogs, according to locals. 
	The 47-year-old man screamed for help as bystanders sought to stop the ferocious attack by hitting the dogs with golf clubs and garden tools. 
	Two drivers even tried ramming the dogs in their cars as the animals gripped the victim's head in their mouths, dragging him along the ground. 
	One witness told news agency PA his arm was severed, while another said it was ""almost ripped off"". 
	When the pets eventually ran off, people in HighÂ Pittington, County Durham, were left in fear until one dog was shot dead by police and the other was captured. 
	The search operation involved the force helicopter and armed officers. 
	An ambulance crew took the owner to the Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle, where he was receiving treatment for his serious but non-life threatening injuries. 
	The victim, believed to be a local bulldog breeder, was out walking the dogs when the attack took place at around 9.10pm on Sunday night. He has regularly been seen in the area walking up to seven bulldogs. 
	Witness Alison MetcalfÂ said she heard shouting outside her home at around 9pm. 
	""I thought I heard somebody shout 'help me' but I couldn't be certain, then I heard my husband come flying in, he threw our own dog through the front door, and said 'there's a man on the ground',"" she said. 
	""The dogs were just ripping him to bits and dragging him around. 
	""Luckily he's a big guy but if it had been child or someone of a smaller build, it's likely they would not have survived the attack."" 
	She said she had heard fireworks before the attack and thought the dogs could have been ""spooked"". 
	Another witness said: ""I've never seen something so vicious and brutal in my life. 
	""People were behind the dogs in a car beeping the horn constantly to try and scare the dogs away, while some other people were also hitting the dogs with garden tools and golf clubs, but no matter what the dogs would not stop. 
	""Eventually the dogs stopped and ran away, and while they were running one of them was hit by a car, several times I think, but it still continued to run away. 
	""Both dogs ended up missing and then that is when an ambulance and a police car arrived at the scene. 
	""Not too long after more police cars arrived and also a helicopter."" 
	Durham Police said one bulldog was ""humanely destroyed"" in the Coronation Terrace area ""a short time after"". 
	The dog that was caught will be kept in kennels while a decision is made about its future. 
	Durham City Neighbourhood Inspector Dave Coxon said: ""I can confirm that both dogs were quickly captured by police and it was necessary for reasons of public safety to humanely destroy one of the dogs. 
	""I understand this must have been a shocking incident for those witnessing it and I would like to thank those members of the public for their efforts in trying to assist the man."" 
	Police are offering counselling to witnesses of the attack. 
	Anyone with information can contact police on 101."

	The bodies of Hannah Witheridge, 23, and David Miller, 24, were found on a beach on September 15. 
	Police have been criticised over the investigation and are now expanding testing, with some 150 officers drafted in to the popular holiday island, which has 1,300 residents. 
	""We will submit one set of DNA samples and wait for their results before collecting another set of samples,"" said Colonel Uakrissadathikarn in The Phuket Gazette. 
	""We will do this until we find the culprits."" 
	Police are also trying to trace fishing boat workers who may been on the island on the day of the killings. 
	Officers previously said ""sexual jealousy"" may have been the motive and revealed DNA taken from Ms Witheridge's body was from two Asian men. 
	Claims the pair may have argued with a Thai man in a local bar are also being investigated. 
	Police Colonel Kissana Phathanacharoen said: ""We have discovered fresh evidence which could lead to a new suspect who may have had a relationship or one-night stand with Hannah or one of her friends or David the night before they were killed. 
	""We have asked the Metropolitan Police to go back and make enquiries of Hannah's friends on this matter."" 
	Ms Witheridge, from Great Yarmouth, suffered severe head wounds and Mr Miller, from Jersey, died from blows to the head and drowning, post-mortem examinations showed. 
	A garden hoe with Ms Witheridge's blood on it was discovered nearby, and investigators are searching for a blunt metal object used on Mr Miller. 
	Ms Witheridge's family said they had now brought their ""beautiful Hannah"" back to the UK. 
	A Â£4,000 police reward is on offer for information, and shocked island residents have also raised several thousand pounds on top of that."
2014-09-22,PM Holds Talks On English Votes For English Law,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140922194724/http://news.sky.com/story/1339905/pm-holds-talks-on-english-votes-for-english-law,"David Cameron has discussed plans to restrict the voting rights of Scottish MPs in the House of Commons. 
	The Prime Minister intends to address the issue of MPs in Scotland being able to vote on policies that affect only England alongside the granting of fresh powers to HolyroodÂ following the Scottish referendum. 
	Mr Cameron discussed the matter with senior Tory MPsÂ at Chequers. 
	One of those MPs, Leader of the House of Commons William Hague, has been asked to head up a Cabinet committee on the issue. 
	He told Sky News: ""This meeting is the beginning of a process of discussion and consultation - it's not to finalise anything. But there was a great deal of common ground and unity among the Conservative MPs. 
	""Everyone was very clear that the commitments made to Scotland must be honoured, and there's also a good understanding that there are natural consequences for the rest of the UK - it's a matter of fairness to all the people of the United Kingdom. 
	""That's why we're saying in the Conservative Party that decisions that only affect England, or England and Wales, should only be made by MPs who represent those parts of the UK."" 
	Mr Hague's committee will include coalition colleagues from the Liberal Democrats - and he opened the possibility of talks with Labour. 
	The row over Mr Cameron's decision to link the issues threatens to overshadow the Labour Party conference, with Ed Miliband under pressure to support the changes. 
	The Labour leader said he backed greater ""scrutiny"" of the issue, but he stopped short of a pledge on votes, arguing such a major constitutional change should not be rushed. 
	Labour, which has 40 of Scotland's 59 MPs, has most to lose from any measures which would restrict the voting rights of MPs representing constituencies north of the border. 
	Speaking to Sky News at the Labour Party conference in Manchester, shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: ""We need, after Scotland, to make sure we have constitutional change which is fair ... but you don't do that on some rushed timetable decided by politicians."" 
	He added: ""We can have fairness and keep our Union. David Cameron giving the impression somehow this is dead easy, he is just trying to fool people and he won't get away with it."" 
	Labour's proposal would see a UK-wide consultation before a constitution was drawn up for MPs to vote on in autumn 2015. 
	Before the referendum, together with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, the Tory and Labour leaders signed a vow to Scottish voters promising further powers if they rejected independence. 
	But within hours of Scotland voting No to devolution, Mr Cameron had announced that the process for looking at the question about voting rights of MPs would proceed in tandem with the deal for Scotland. 
	A No 10 source stressed the two processes would run in parallel, but the package for Holyrood was not conditional on reaching agreement at Westminster about English votes. 
	The Prime Minister's ""English votes for English laws"" summit at Chequers has been seen as an attempt to head off a potential backbench rebellion on constitutional reform amid concern about the promises made to Scotland. 
	First Minister Alex Salmond claimed the Westminster party leaders tricked people into voting No to independence with their last-minute promise of more powers for Holyrood. 
	He toldÂ Sky News: ""It's the people who voted No because they believed these commitments from the Westminster leadership, these are the people who are feeling most angry, most hurt, most disappointed in Scotland today."""
2014-09-22,Why Ed Miliband Must Give Speech Of His Life,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140922194724/http://news.sky.com/story/1340081/why-ed-miliband-must-give-speech-of-his-life,"By Faisal Islam, Political Editor It is entirely understandable that the fallout from the Scottish referendum casts a shadow over this Labour conference. 
	Alex Salmond may be exiting stage left from Bute House and allegedly from frontline politics, but he leaves the entire United Kingdom in an uncertain and febrile state - what I call ""devolution revolution"". 
	For Ed Miliband and his aides: fury at what they call the Prime Minister's ""dawn raid"" on the constitution as the ink was barely dry on the referendum ballot papers. 
	It was a ""political scam"" they say, having agreed earlier in the week that the famous ""vow"" was an unconditional and solemn promise to the Scottish people. 
	Of course it is perfectly reasonable that the PM would consider it impossible to offer further powers to Scotland without considering a broader settlement for the whole of the UK, including England. 
	But Mr Miliband has his own issues. Some of his backbenchers are unhappy with the lack of ""English votes for English laws"" too. And they warn him, that he stands no chance of becoming prime minister without the Labour Party being seen as a party of England. 
The PM will host a fascinating meeting at Chequers of what you might call the Devosceptics. John Redwood, Bernard Jenkins, alongside Dominic Grieve and Rory Stewart are on the guest list. The aim: to hose down some of the anger at the PM's signature on ""the vow"" to Scotland. 
	But here is the issue for the PM. Of course he has his own party political problem at the Conservative/UKIP border of his party. There could be further Carswells on this issue. But is it really a vote winner? Is there a groundswell of concern across the country that Scotland is getting too much? 
	Perhaps on public spending and the maintenance of the Barnett formula. But I suspect that the vow on Barnett has considerable wriggle room as regards the burden of funding higher Scottish spending levels falling on Scottish taxes. 
	In Manchester, EdÂ Miliband says he has learnt a different lesson from ""the 45"" (% vote for Scottish independence). It reflects a generalised lack of faith in what I call ""the Circle Line bubble"" - Westminster, the media and the City - from across the whole of the United Kingdom. 
	Labour has already announced plans, based on Lord Adonis' ideas for Â£30bn of devolution of spending to city regions, starting with here, in greater Manchester. 
	If the Conservatives obsess with constitutional reform and the rights of one type of MP over another in the coming weeks and months, then Labour is perfectly happy to focus on living standards and the NHS. 
	If the Conservatives continue to bang the drum about how great the economy is, Labour's private polling is that it continues to entrench the Conservatives as ""out of touch"" with the reality of modern Britain for ordinary voters. 
	There was very little comeback from the Conservatives about Ed Miliband's pay rise - a minimum wage of Â£8 by 2020. Labour has noticed that George Osborne has been claiming the recovery for a year now. The macroeconomic numbers have gone his way. But Labour retains a poll lead. 
	Now Mr Miliband must make a step up, and give the speech of his life. He has to persuade half the country that he can be a Prime Minister. 
	Yet the Labour city of Glasgow just voted for independence. The distraction of Scotland makes that harder. But we are in for another epic few days in British politics."

	Dr Shaleema Islam-Zulfiqar travelled to Syria with Mr Henning in December last year as part of a convoy delivering aid to Syrian citizens. 
	Speaking to Sky News, she made a direct plead for the 47-year-old's release: ""Please let him go and release him back to us - to his family and his friends."" 
	Mr Henning had volunteered to drive an ambulance full of medical supplies as part of the charity trip, which was organised by the Bolton and the UK Arab Society. 
	The group planned to transport life-saving medical equipment to a hospital in Idlib, in northwestern Syria. 
	It is believed Mr Henning was abducted in al Dana, a town 24 miles from Aleppo, by IS shortly after arriving in the country. 
	Dr Shaleema Islam-Zulfiqar she feels UK authorities ""haven't been there to support"" members of the charity group affected by the kidnapping. 
	""It's noted that the Government really haven't been there to support us,"" she said. 
	""There was nothing from the UK authorities to support the fact that we had a team member that had been taken (and) detained. 
	""We didn't know where he was and we didn't know what had happened to him. 
	""Now, I appreciate that there are sensitivities around the issue and the government has to be seen to be doing something behind the scenes. 
	""But we had nothing, no idea what had happened to Alan until that video aired last Saturday evening."" 
	Her comments followed a renewed plea from Mr Henning's wife Barbara. 
	In a statement released through the Foreign Office she described her husband as a ""peaceful, selfless"" man. 
	""Alan is a peaceful, selfless man who left his family and his job as a taxi driver in the UK to drive in a convoy all the way to Syria with his Muslim colleagues and friends to help those most in need,"" she said. 
	""When he was taken he was driving an ambulance full of food and water to be handed out to anyone in need. 
	""His purpose for being there was no more and no less. This was an act of sheer compassion. 
	""I cannot see how it could assist any state's cause to allow the world to see a man like Alan dying. 
	""I have been trying to communicate with the Islamic State and the people holding Alan. I have sent some really important messages but they have not been responded to. 
	""I pray that the people holding Alan respond to my messages and contact me before it is too late. 
	""When they hear this message I implore the people of Islamic State to see it in their hearts to release my husband Alan Henning."""
2014-09-22,Eight Headaches For Supermarket Giant Tesco,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140922194724/http://news.sky.com/story/1340172/eight-headaches-for-supermarket-giant-tesco,"A decade ago Tesco was an investor's delight, with a share price shooting up more than 70% between 2004 and 2007, and healthy dividend payments. So what went wrong? 
PROFIT WARNINGS 
	With 14 years as CEO to his credit, Sir Terry Leahy stepped down in 2011 after overseeing a leap in pre-tax profit from Â£750m in 1997 to Â£3.4bn in 2010. Yet less than a year into the job as new CEO, Philip Clarke issued the first profit warning in two decades as a result of a poor 2011 Christmas trading period. 
CHANGING TASTES 
	Tesco was being squeezed by changing consumer tastes, a dislike of its cavernous and cold stores, and complaints about frosty customer service. It unveiled a Â£1bn revamp plan in April 2012. 
AMERICAN ADVENTURE 
	In April 2013 it reported its first fall in annual profit for 19 years, with a post-tax profit plunging 95% to Â£120m, after suffering a Â£1.2bn charge to exit its struggling Fresh & Easy American venture. 
PROPERTY BUST 
	It also suffered a write-down of Â£804m for land bought at the height of the property boom, earmarked for development but subsequently put on hold. 
MEAT SCANDAL 
	Last year, Tesco was caught up in the biggest food fraud of the century - with some of its beef burgers found to contain up to 29% horsemeat. 
CLEVER COMPETITION 
	German discounters continue to nibble away at Tesco's customer base at one end, while M&S and Waitrose take share from consumers willing to pay more for premium products. 
BIG NOT NIMBLE 
	Despite the woes Tesco remains the country's biggest retailer and still dwarfs its competition. Tesco is around the same size as Sainsbury's and Morrisons combined, and globally employs more than half a million people in 12 countries. But big rarely means nimble. A large number of senior staff have quit the company in recent years and 40-year Tesco veteran Mr Clarke was ousted by the board last July, after dismissing critics of his turnaround plans. 
SIDELINES 
	Tesco wholly-owns a retail research company named dunnhumby, with offshoots including BzzAgent, KSS Retail, and Sociomantic - which sells display adverts on Facebook and mobiles. 
	This analysis arm crunches data from over 350 million consumers in 28 countries and sells it to corporate giants such as Coca-Cola, Shell and Procter & Gamble. The Tesco empire is huge, with numerous and competing divisions, and as a result does not always see the wood for the trees. 
	Dunnhumby does not trumpet the Tesco parentage on its website - but maybe it is time Tesco starts looking in-house for an answer to its woes."

	Callum Howkins, 17, from Hinckley in Leicestershire, failed to surface during a dive at Tamarin Bay, Mauritius. 
	His body was found an hour later by the coastguard. 
	The tragedy happened on August 29 following his father's marriage at the La Pirogue Hotel, a luxury four-star resort on the Indian Ocean island. 
	Callum had tweeted earlier: ""Sitting on the beach, drinking from coconuts, watching the womenâs water aerobics. Could life get any better?"" 
	Police say the skipper of the dive boat had been arrested, but insist Callum had not been dragged down by the dolphins. 
	His death brings to 13 the number of people to have lost their lives in the area's waters so far this year. 
	Police spokesman Darmarajen Mooroogan told the Mirror: ""Callum was on an excursion off the coast of Tamarin Bay when he drowned while swimming. 
	""A skipper of the boat that conveyed him has been arrested. A preliminary charge of involuntary homicide by imprudence was lodged against him before a court of law. He did appear in court and was released on bail. 
	""The investigation is at a very early stage and we are not yet prepared to discuss details of the accident."" 
	His mum, Louise, told the Leicester Mercury: ""I can't put into words how amazing he was. 
	""He was beautiful inside and out. 
	""He used to say to me, 'Mum, I'm 99.9% perfect', and I always said, 'No, youâre 100% perfect'."" 
	The teenager, who worked part time in a pub, had been about to start an engineering apprenticeship with Caterpillar after completing his first year of A-Levels at John Cleveland College in Hinckley, where staff and students have created a book of remembrance for him. 
	Callum's dad, Gavin, said: ""Nobody ever had a bad word to say about Callum. 
	""He was a real gentleman and treated everyone with so much respect. 
	""He touched everybodyâs lives. 
	""He loved everybody and everybody loved him. 
	""He will always be my boy."" 
	A spokesman for John Cleveland College said: ""Callum was a considerate, thoughtful young man with an infectious smile and an ability to bring people together. 
	""His humour and openness meant he was widely known, respected and liked by students and by staff."" 
	An inquest is to be be held into the circumstances of his death."

	The striker received a string of racist messages after he reacted to Manchester United's shock 5-3 defeat at Leicester City by posting: ""Man Utd...LOL."" 
	Merseyside Police have used the site to confirm they are looking into the messages. 
	""We can confirm officers are looking into offensive comments made on Twitter about Mario Balotelli earlier today,"" read a tweet from the force's official account. 
	A spokesman for Merseyside Police said: ""As far as I am aware there have been no complaints, but we have been made aware of it by a number of press inquiries."" 
	A Liverpool FC spokesman told Sky News: ""We are not making any comment at this time while a police investigation is under way. We will allow the police to do their work before saying anything on the matter."" 
	Former Arsenal and England striker Ian Wright expressed his shock at the abuse by tweeting: ""Cannot believe the abuse @FinallyMario took ! In this day and age. Over a comment about a game of football. Disgraceful."" 
	Anti-discrimination body Kick It Out contacted police after being alerted to the abuse by other users of social media. 
	A spokesperson said: ""We extend our support to Mario Balotelli after the appalling racist abuse directed at him on Twitter earlier today. 
	""A large number of social media users alerted us to the messages by tweeting our official account and we have since reported this via True Vision - the Police's online reporting facility. 
	""During the 2013/14 season, 50% of all complaints submitted to us from across the game related to social media abuse."" 
	Kick It Out reported a 269% increase in incidents on the previous season during the 2013-14 season, half of them (142) involving social media. 
	The former Inter Milan, Manchester City and AC Milan player has been singled out for racist abuse in the past. 
	He was heckled by Italian supporters at a pre-World Cup training camp earlier this year and was on the receiving end of numerous instances of racist abuse during his time in Italy. 
	Balotelli spoke about the abuse in an interview with GQ earlier this summer.

2014-09-23,Dave Lee Travis Guilty Of Indecent Assault,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140923231646/http://news.sky.com/story/1340776/dave-lee-travis-guilty-of-indecent-assault,"Former Radio 1 presenter Dave Lee Travis has been found guilty of one count of indecent assault. 
	The ex-Top Of The Pops presenter was cleared of another count of indecent assault, and the jury was undecided on a count of sexual assault. 
	The 69-year-old DJÂ stared straight ahead with a stony expression as the verdicts were read out atÂ London's Southwark Crown Court. 
	Judge Anthony Leonard QC warned him he was looking at ""all options"" for sentencing. 
	Travis, from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, was convicted of groping a woman working on the Mrs Merton Show on January 17, 1995. 
	Prosecutors claimed he approached her as she stood smoking in the corridor and put his hands on her chest for at least 10-15 seconds until she ran away. 
	She spoke to police about the allegation following Travis' first indecent assault trial earlier this year. 
	Prosecutor Teresa Hay said the Crown would not be seeking a retrial on the count of sexual assault which the jury was hung on, and a formal verdict of not guilty was entered. 
	The jury forewomanÂ said they had found Travis guilty of indecent assault by a majority of 10-2. 
	They returned their verdicts after 19 hours and 15 minutes of deliberations. 
	During the trial, prosecutors claimed Travis was an ""opportunist"" who acted as if he had the ""perfect right"" to grope young women. 
	Travis, who appeared in court under his real name David Griffin, faced a retrial after jurors failed to reach verdicts on two of the charges in February. 
	He was first arrested in 2012 under Operation Yewtree, Scotland Yard's investigation into historical sexual abuse in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. 
	The allegations against him dated back to the 1990s when he was starring in panto, while the most recent was said to have happened during an interview with a journalist at his home in 2008. 
	Jenny Hopkins, Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor for the CPS, said: ""David Griffin, also known as Dave Lee Travis, indecently assaulted a young woman by touching her in a way that was not only deeply invasive but also against the law. 
	""We thank the jury for their careful consideration in this case and we respect all the verdicts of the court today. 
	""The prosecution of sexual offences is often difficult and complex, perhaps even more so when the allegations are from some years ago. 
	""We will continue to consider cases and, wherever there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest, we will work with police to build strong cases which can be put before the court."""
2014-09-23,Dave Lee Travis: The Fall Of A Familiar Face,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140923231646/http://news.sky.com/story/1340843/dave-lee-travis-the-fall-of-a-familiar-face,"By Ian Woods, Senior Correspondent Dave Lee Travis fought accusations that he was a sex pest for two years, and was acquitted of most of the charges against him at an earlier trial. 
	But a second jury has now decided that he is guilty of indecent assault. 
	At the height of his career, Travis was one of the most familiar faces in Britain. He presented Top of the Pops and the Radio 1 Breakfast Show. 
	His real name is David Griffin, but his nickname was the ""Hairy Cornflake"". During his original trial he described himself as ""a big hairy cuddly bear"" who liked to hug friends and colleagues. 
	Travis admitted being tactile, but the women who testified against him claimed he went way beyond that, accusing him of groping them or worse. 
	When the DJ was arrested and questioned about allegations of indecent assault, the publicity prompted other women to come forward with stories of their encounters with him. 
	By the time he went on trial in February, he was facing 13 charges of indecent assault and one of sexual assault. 
	After a month-long trial, he was acquitted of all but two offences, which the jury could not reach a verdict on. 
	Much to Travis's anger, the Crown Prosecution Service decided on a retrial and added a new accusation from another complainant.Â  This time, he was convicted of a single count of indecent assault. 
	As the legal process dragged on, the DJ became more frustrated - and in July, he made a statement outside court, which at the time could not be broadcast for legal reasons. 
	He said: ""In my estimation, the CPS has overcompensated for its failings with Savile and in doing so has taken away the human rights and the dignity of individuals by having the police arrest people first, then go out looking for the evidence."" 
	Five months before he was first arrested, the Sunday Times published a story by Camilla Long which highlighted his behaviour. 
	She had visited his home to interview him because he was about to meet the Burmese opposition leaderÂ Aung San Suu Kyi. 
	The article's headline read: ""Dave Lee Travis: Look out, Suu Kyi - he's a bit touchy"". 
	Ms Long wrote: ""I spent 90 minutes with the former Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis and I don't think there is a part of my body that he didn't grope. 
	""He fondled my foot, inched his hands up my thighs, tried to make me sit on his lap and kissed me. He copped a feel of my hips when I foolishly asked for a tour of his studio, stroked my chin and my back and gave me a full body hug as I left."" 
	Ms Long was asked by the police whether she wanted to press charges and give evidence at his trial, but declined. 
	She told Sky News: ""He didn't worry about getting consent too much, he just did it."""
2014-09-23,Alan Henning Pleads For Life In Recording,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140923231646/http://news.sky.com/story/1341011/alan-henning-pleads-for-life-in-recording,"The wife of British hostage Alan Henning has issued a plea to Islamic State militants after receiving an audio recording of her husband pleading for his life. 
	""I am Barbara Henning, the wife of Alan Henning. I have a further message for Islamic State,"" she saidÂ in a statement released through the Foreign Office. 
	""An audio file of Alan pleading for his life has just been received by me. I and people representing me continue to reach out to those holding Alan. 
	""Islamic State continue to ignore our pleas to open dialogue."" 
	Mr Henning travelled to Syria in December last year as part of a convoy delivering humanitarian aid to Syrian citizens. 
	He had volunteered to drive an ambulance full of medical supplies as part of the charity trip, which was organised by the Bolton and the UK Arab Society. 
	The group planned to transport life-saving medical equipment to a hospital in Idlib, northwestern Syria. 
	It is believed Mr Henning was abducted by IS in al Dana, a town 24 miles from Aleppo, shortly after arriving in the country. 
	Mrs Henning said her husband went to Syria to help the country's ""most vulnerable"" people by delivering ""much-needed aid"". 
	""We are at a loss (as to) why those leading Islamic State cannot open their hearts and minds to the facts surrounding Alan's imprisonment and why they continue to threaten his life,"" she said. 
	""I have been told that he has been to a Sharia Court and found innocent of being a spy and declared to be no threat. 
	""I implore Islamic State to abide by the decisions of their own justice system. Please release Alan."" 
	Prime Minister David Cameron is in talks over Britain's role in the battle against Islamic State fighters. 
	Mr Cameron was consulted before the US and Arab Allies launched strikes against the terrorist group in Syria overnight. 
	Downing Street said Mr Cameron would spend the next 48 hours at the United Nations discussing ""what more the UK and others can do to contribute to international efforts to tackle the threat we face from ISIL"". 
	The PM is expected to recall MPs, who are on recess for the party conference season, as soon as Friday to consult on the issue of Britain joining the US airstrikes. 
	Speaking after the US and five Arab nations launched their strikes in Syria, President Barack Obama repeated his vow to build an international coalition to defeat IS. 
	He said defeating IS would take time and effort, but added: ""We're going to do what's necessary to take the fight to this terrorist group."""

	Microphones picked up the Prime Minister telling former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg how the monarch reacted during their phone conversation on Friday morning. 
	He said: ""The definition of relief is being the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and ringing the Queen and saying 'It's alright, it's okay'. That was something. 
	""She purred down the line."" 
	After a few seconds during which the recording is not clear, Mr Cameron added: ""But it should never have been that close. 
	""It wasn't in the end, but there was a time in the middle of the campaign when it feltâ¦"" 
	The next part of the conversation is inaudible before the Prime Minister, who is in New York for the United Nations General Assembly, is heard saying: ""I've said I want to find these polling companies and I want to sue them for my stomach ulcers because of what they put me through. 
	""It was very nervous moments."" 
	The conversation took place as Mr Cameron was being accompanied around MrÂ Bloomberg's offices in front of TV cameras. 
	The Queen remained publicly impartial during the referendum campaign, but the Prime Minister's comments suggest she was relieved that Scots voted 55% to 45% in favour of retaining the Union. 
	Sky News Royal Correspondent Paul Harrison said Buckingham Palace would neither confirm nor deny whether the Queen purrs when she is happy. 
	He added: ""Some will say this is incredibly indiscreet, and that conversations he has with the Queen shouldn't be passed on no matter who you are. 
	""The fact is, David Cameron has told Michael Bloomberg that when he delivered the news, she was very happy - she purred down the line."" 
	A Downing Street spokesman said they do not comment on private conversations."
2014-09-23,Miliband Sets Six Goals For Britain's Future,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140923231646/http://news.sky.com/story/1340783/miliband-sets-six-goals-for-britains-future,"Ed Miliband has set out six national goals for the coming decade as he attempted to show voters he has what it takes to be Prime Minister. 
	In his last party conference speech before the general election, the Labour leader said the country must look to build a new future ""together"" because it could not afford ""another five years of David Cameron"". 
	The Labour leader put saving the NHS at the heart of his 10-year plan, saying a mansion tax on properties over Â£2mÂ and taxes on the tobacco firms would be used to pay for it. 
	He said the country needed to change because it ""does not work"" and talked about breaking up the big banks, halving the number of Britons on low pay and tackling the cost of living. 
	In a speech - which was overshadowed halfway through by Barack Obama's press conference on airstrikes in Syria and Iraq - he said: ""You know this country does not work. 
	""My answer is we can build a better future for you and your family and this speech is about Labour's plan to do it - Labour's plan for Britain's future."" 
	A pre-prepared version of MrÂ Milibandâs speech briefed to journalists and posted on Labour.org.uk this afternoon contained a section on reducing Britain's deficit. 
	However this was left out of his delivery and he was criticised by Conservative MP Harry Smith who said: ""Ed Miliband has let the cat out of the bag â he has no plan to deal with the deficit and no plan for the economy."" 
A Labour source explained this was a slip and told Sky News:Â ""This was a long speech and some things changed in delivery. He made clear no plans for additional borrowing."" 
Speaking without notes, Mr Miliband outlined his six national goals:Â  
:: To reward people for hard work - raising the national wage to half the number of people on low pay 
:: To tackle the cost of living crisis and make sure wages increased with economic growth, breaking up banks and taking power from Whitehall 
:: Britain to create a million jobs in green industries - helping to tackle global climate change 
:: Making sure as many school leavers go on to apprenticeships as go to university - companies who employ foreign workers will be expected to offer apprenticeships too, and those who want Government contracts will need to provide apprenticeships 
:: Making the dream of home-ownership a reality by building more homes and making sure 400,000 first-time buyers a year get on property ladder 
:: Save the NHS - provide a ""truly 21st century health service"" using the proceeds of a mansion tax on homes above Â£2m and a tax on tobacco firms 
Sky News Political Editor Faisal Islam said Labour appeared to have decided on an election campaign agenda that said: ""The Government can help solve your problems."" 
	Mr Miliband opened his speech by urging Mr Cameron to seek a United Nations Security Council resolution to ""counter the threat"" of Islamic State fighters in Iraq and Syria. 
	He said the threats they had made against the British hostage Alan Henning, who is from Manchester where the conference was being held, meant action had to be taken. 
	The Labour leader said Britain should not turn its back on the world, outlining a foreign policy which would see a Labour Government committed to finding a two-state solution for the Israelis and Palestinians. 
	Mr Miliband also stressed the country should not walk away from the European Union, and thanked former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling for helping to deliver a no vote in the Scottish referendum. 
	Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said Mr Miliband ""failed to offer any serious plan to grow the economy"". 
	""Labour simply don't have a long-term economic plan to secure a better future for Britain. Our country, our children and our grandchildren would be worse off under Ed Miliband's weak leadership."""
2014-09-23,Fact Check: Do Ed Miliband's Claims Stack Up?,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140923231646/http://news.sky.com/story/1340974/fact-check-do-ed-milibands-claims-stack-up,"Ed Miliband has set out his six goals for Britain's future in his speech to the Labour conference. So how do some of his claims fare under closer scrutiny? 
:: Claim One: The number of apprenticeships has fallen under the current government 
	This is true for young people under 19. The number starting apprenticeships fell from 129,900 in the 2011/12 academic year to 114,500 in the 2012/13 academic year. The apparent small fall from the previous year is possibly due to a minor change in the way they were counted. 
	Apprenticeship starts for those aged 19-24 and 25 upwards increased between 2010/11 and 2011/12 before remaining at a similar level in 2012/13, with the biggest increase among those aged over 25. 
	The Institute for Public Policy Research has suggested the increase could be due in part to companies shifting their employees onto apprenticeships in order to access government funding. 
Claim Two: Labour will ensure people's wages grow in line with the economy 
	There are all sorts of ways to measure the ""cost of living"" but one of the most common is to compare the rises in prices and wages. 
	Real wages - wages adjusted for prices - have been falling since 2008 as price rises have outstripped wage increases. 
	This measure alone is limited: it doesn't say anything about how household incomes have changed - this includes, for instance, the effects of tax and benefit changes. 
	The Institute for Fiscal Studies calculates the median income fell by 5.8% between 2009-10 and 2012-13. 
Claim Three: Housebuilding is at its lowest since the 1920s 
	This is correct, apart from housebuilding during Second World War, according to figures for England and Wales. 
	Ed Miliband said a Labour government would aim to double the number of first-time buyers who get on the housing ladder each year by 2025. 
	Historical data to 2010 suggests the number of first-time buyers is at a fairly low level, with about 200,000 loans given to first-time buyers in 2010. 
	This excludes those buying a house outright for the first time, without a mortgage. 
	More recent data from the Council of Mortgage Lenders suggests the figure has been increasing, with first-time buyer loans in June 2014 up 18% on the same time in 2013, but there is no annual data available to compare back. 
Claim Four: Britain is behind Germany, Japan, the US, India and China for low-carbon green technologies and services. 
	According to government figures, in 2011/12 the UK was ranked sixth globally overall for its low carbon and environmental goods and services sector, with the US, China, Japan, India and Germany making up the top five. 
	So although this claim seems to be correct, these are the only countries that the UK is behind. 
	The UK's green goods and services market was valued at just over Â£128bn in 2011/12, Â£17bn less than Germany but around Â£24bn more than France (which was 7th). 
Claim Five: One in five workers finds themselves on low pay 
	The average UK worker earns about Â£11.62 an hour, and just over 20% earn less than two-thirds of that (Â£7.75), often defined as ""low pay"". 
	This is very close to the Living Wage currently set at Â£7.65 nationally (apart from a higher rate for London). 
	Just over five million people in the UK earn the Living Wage or less; again close to one in five of all UK workers. 
	The Minimum Wage represents lower pay still. Ed Miliband has pledged this will rise to Â£8 by 2020 under a Labour government. 
	This is likely to be a real-terms increase if inflation continues at current levels. For the last few years, the Minimum Wage has increased by less than inflation. 
Claim Six: One in four people have to wait a week or more for a GP appointment. 
	The latest survey for NHS England shows 14% of those who tried to see or speak to someone at their GP surgery got an appointment a week or more after they phoned up, while 11% didn't get one at all. 
	But not everybody wanted an appointment straight away - 14% of patients didn't have a particular day in mind for an appointment, and 6% wanted an appointment a week or more later."
2014-09-23,Miliband Introduces A Friend Called Ed,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140923231646/http://news.sky.com/story/1340933/miliband-introduces-a-friend-called-ed,"By Faisal Islam, Political Editor It was a speech noticeable for its omissions as well as its content. 
	Ed Miliband and team are calculating that they can win this election on territory not previously considered fertile for prospective PMs. That Britain after the financial crisis has changed. That the hard-pressed British people need a friend with a helping hand. A friend called Ed. 
	He called it the start of his job interview with the British people for the post of Prime Minister, and accordingly he started with his support for the overnight airstrikes by the US and allies on IS inside Syria, but called for some UN help. He also paid tribute to the hostage Alan Henning. 
	After this sombre start, in keeping with a conference overshadowed by the aftermath of the Scottish referendum, Mr Miliband's speech took a while to get going. But then it caught fire. 
	It was a surprise, really. Labour won a ground-war victory in the Scottish referendum. Here in Manchester, they basically own the whole council: a one party state, with neither Tories nor Lib Dems. 
	Perhaps he thinks the whole country is turning into Manchester, because I'd sum the speech up in three words: core, vote, strategy.Â  
	It was an uncompromising speech seeking to draw dividing lines with the Conservatives, despite the fact he doesn't have a lot of money to play with in terms of public spending. 
	He talked about the Conservatives running a 'You're on your own' government that doesn't care about the people. 
	He is trying to reignite people's faith in the state solving problems for people, whether it's jobs, low pay, house building, getting people back on the housing ladder. 
	He's asking you to trust that he can solve these problems. 
	Ed Miliband and the Labour party feel they can win an election on that agenda - an agenda where government to some degree can solve your problems. 
	It requires a lot of trust in him, trust that is not reflected in his personal ratings. But his personal ratings so far have not afflicted the Labour party, which is between four and six points ahead. 
	Will he have reached out to the rest of the country beyond that conference hall? Was he trying to? Or does he think there's no chance of winning Conservative voters but he can rely on winning an election on Lib Dem switches, a few UKIP votes that fall away, core Labour votes and young people? 
	The speech was littered with reference to Gareth, Rosie, Colin, but above all Gareth. A collection of park-dwellers who have problems that Ed can help with. Is Ed's parklife representative of Britain's traditional individualism? 
	My sense from Manchester is that they think they're on to a new politics around young voters, registration campaigns, Westminster weariness, and taking the blows from the ""middle-of-the-road"" mainstream media. 
	They aren't pitching for Conservative vote switchers. The covering letter on this job application is rather atypical."
2014-09-23,Alice Gross Search: Forensic Tests On Knife,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140923231646/http://news.sky.com/story/1340487/alice-gross-search-forensic-tests-on-knife,"Forensic tests are being carried out on a knife found during the search for missing teenager Alice Gross. 
	The investigation into her disappearance is focusing on the River Brent and its banks near Ealing Hospital in west London, where the knife was found. 
	The search for 14-year-old Alice, who went missing after leaving her home in nearby Hanwell on August 28, is the biggest operation of its kind since the 7/7 bombings in 2005. 
	Scotland Yard said: ""The knife will be taken away for analysis but it is too early to say if it's connected."" 
	Police have also released a new picture of prime suspect Arnis Zalkalns, taken with Latvian police after his wife was murdered in his home country. 
	The force has come under fire for taking four days to ask Latvian authorities for help in finding Zalkalns, who served seven years in prison for the killing of his wife, Rudite Zalkalns. 
	He went missing six days after Alice was last seen walking alongside the Grand Union Canal, not far from her home. 
	Zalkalns has not accessed his bank account or used his mobile phone since September 3, nor has he returned home to his partner and young child. 
	His passport was left at his house and police in Latvia have confirmed he has not entered the country by plane. 
	They said it is possible he could have got in undetected if he travelled by car or coach. 
	Zalkalns was seen on CCTV footage cycling along a path by the Grand Union Canal 15 minutes after the last sighting of Alice. 
	Detectives believe he is likely to have seen Alice as they were both going north along the canal towpath. 
	A reward of up to Â£20,000 is being offered for anyone who has information that leads detectives to find Alice. 
	Zalkalns is white, 5ft 10ins and stocky, with dark brown hair that he normally wears tied in a pony tail. 
	Police have said that he ""potentially poses a risk to the public"" and have asked anyone who sees him not to approach him and to dial 999."

	David Cameron was consulted before the US and Arab allies launched their first strikes against the terrorist group in Syria overnightÂ and has given his backing to the targeting of the terror group. 
	Downing Street said Mr Cameron would spend the next 48 hours at the United Nations discussing ""what more the UK and others can do to contribute to international efforts to tackle the threat we face from ISIL"". 
	There have been suggestions the PM could recall MPs, who are on recess for the party conference season, as soon as Friday to consult on the issue of Britain joining the US airstrikes. 
	Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen told Sky News: ""I hope that the PM will go to Parliament for a vote. He has indicated that he will and I think that would be the right thing to do. I think the rumour is we might be going back on Friday."" 
	However, America has not asked the UK to take part in direct combat action against IS, also known as ISIS or ISIL. 
	Mr Cameron is to meet Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in an attempt to win backing for the West's fight against the IS fighters. 
	It will be the first time a British prime minister has met an Iranian president since 1979. 
	Senior Labour figures have indicated the party would listen ""sympathetically"" to the case for military intervention and said the situation was significantly different to last year's vote on action in Syria. 
	Then, the party voted down Mr Cameron's plan to intervene after the Syrian regime used chemical weapons against its own people. 
	Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander told Sky News Labour ""understands and supports"" the action taken by the US and urged Mr Cameron and Barack Obama to work for a UN resolution on action. 
	Mr Cameron is due to return to the UK on Thursday and has previously said he would consult Parliament before any military intervention. 
	The UK continues to provide military and humanitarian aid. So far Britain has supplied Iraqi and Kurdish fighters with equipment to assist in the battle against IS. 
	Mr Cameron has ruled out boots on the ground but it is understood other military options are on the table. 
	Speaking in Germany in recent weeks, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond ruled out airstrikes in Syria. 
	There has been concern among a number of politicians that joining the strikes against IS targets would be seen as an endorsement of BasharÂ alÂ Assad's regime. 
	Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna told Sky News IS was ""evil"" and had to be eliminated. 
	He said it was ""inconceivable"" Mr Cameron could proceed with airstrikes without consulting Parliament. 
	Mr Umunna added the ""boots on the ground"" option, which has been suggested by former prime minister Tony Blair, was ""not on the agenda at this point""."

2014-09-23,Tesco Profit Error: Could Something Be Amiss?,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140923231646/http://news.sky.com/story/1340272/tesco-profit-error-could-something-be-amiss,"By Ian King, Business Presenter Even from a lesser company, three profits warnings inside a year would be startling. 
	Coming from a blue-chip stalwart like Tesco, it is nothing short of astonishing. 
	In issuing a profits warning on top of a profits warning, Britainâs biggest food retailer almost seems to be taking to an extreme the strategy so commonly seen in its stores, with three for the price of two. 
	So what exactly has Dave Lewis, the new chief executive, uncovered? 
	Well, in its own words, Tesco has identified an overstatement of its expected profit for the half year, principally due to the accelerated recognition of commercial income and delayed accrual of costs. 
	In other words, the reporting of costs incurred in the first half of the year appears to have been delayed so they are pushed into the second half, while profits enjoyed during the second half of the year appear to have been brought forward into the first half. 
	It is unclear what kind of activities generated these profits but commercial income, with regard to supermarkets, could mean rebates from third-party suppliers or payments from those suppliers to incentivise Tesco to give their goods better positions when they are displayed in its stores. 
	This latter practice is common place in the supermarket sector and, having worked previously at Unilever, Mr Lewis will be familiar with it. 
	The overall effect of these two actions will have been to pretty up Tescoâs first-half numbers. 
	Cynics will suggest Mr Lewis has every reason to restate the numbers lower - after all, the period, the six months to August 23, was when his predecessor, Philip Clarke, was at the helm. 
	Some would say it is in Mr Lewisâs interests to ensure that period is painted in as bad a light as possible in order to make any subsequent turnaround under him look better. 
	Itâs known as ""kitchen sinking"" in the City - where every possible bad bit of news, including the proverbial kitchen sink, is thrown into the accounts to make them look bad. 
	But the sheer size of this overstatement, Â£250m, would suggest this is a bit more serious. 
	So is Mr Lewis' response: the suspension of four of Tesco's UK executives, his recruitment of the top City lawyers Freshfields to investigate and his hiring of outside auditors from Deloitte - Tescoâs regular auditor is PwC - to examine what has happened. 
	At this time, there is no suggestion that anything illegal has been happening. After all, all businesses occasionally recognise revenues early or take their time to recognise costs in the accounts. 
	Yet the sheer aggression of the accounting policy in this instance and Mr Lewis' response to discovering it rather suggests he thinks something may be amiss. 
	And, with plenty of American investors - who tend to be more litigious than their European counterparts - on Tesco's shareholder base,Â  he is doing the prudent thing in checking this out as thoroughly as possible."
2014-09-23,Labour's Struggle With Big Figures Of The Past,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140923231646/http://news.sky.com/story/1340240/labours-struggle-with-big-figures-of-the-past,"Ed Balls made considerable play in his conference speech of the need for Labour to confront past failings as well as trumpet successes. 
	But it feels as though some parts of Labour history are still no-go areas. 
	In particular, one would almost think there is a conspiracy of silence when it comes to the two most dominant figures of recent Labour history - Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. 
	Nobody in Manchester wants to talk about Tony Blair. Since this conference hall played host to his farewell speech as Labour leader, he has been an ever-absent at party gatherings. 
	Perhaps more surprising given his recent success in Scotland is the reluctance to give Gordon Brown his due. 
	Ed Miliband, in an impromptu speech to the hall, thanked all and sundry involved in the Labour campaign, from Alistair Darling to Johann Lamont and Anas Sarwar, and yet neglected to mention the man that some are crediting with saving the Union. 
	It leaves one with the sense that in Labour's hurry to move on and look to the future, it can at times seem as though the party is afraid of grappling with the big figures of its past."
2014-09-23,Was This The Rehabilitation Of Gordon Brown?,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140923231646/http://news.sky.com/story/1338658/was-this-the-rehabilitation-of-gordon-brown,"By Faisal Islam, Political Editor An important subplot of this week's constitutional convulsions was the role of former prime minister Gordon Brown. 
	Although it appears he was parachuted in to help the No campaign after the late-August Salmond surge, the rapprochement between Mr Brown and his former colleague and antagonist Alistair Darling occurred months ago. He always was going to play a significant role. 
	In those months Mr Brown had regularly pleaded with Conservatives to firm up an offer for maximal devolution to bring home the No vote. 
	The Conservatives resisted. 
	While the polls showed a 20 point lead under Mr Darling, why would they offer such gifts? 
	But when the polls tightened after the second debate, with Labour voters tempted by a promise of a Scotland free of Tory rule forever, Mr Brown took control. 
	It was essentially an insurance policy. A premium paid in the form of a promise and then a vow, against even a small risk of the unthinkable break up of the union. 
	And Mr Brown knew that Downing Street would pay it. A set, tight timetable for more devolution of tax and spending powers, achieved by aligning the core of three unionist parties' devolution plans. Draft legislation by Burns Night in January. 
	Mr Brown has long form for championing extra powers for Scotland stretching back to his student days. 
	It gave credibility to a vague promise. 
	And most importantly the SNP found it difficult to attack him too much. 
	As one senior SNP member puts it: ""We can't attack Gordon Brown - all we can say is 'he's a good man, but he's got this one wrong."" Mr Brown announced the timetable and the powers, and within hours Downing Street and the other parties signed up to the deal. 
	This was no ploy from Mr Brown. He was achieving, through deployment of his Scottish political capital in an electoral crisis, some of the constitutional reforms he had hoped to achieve as prime minister. 
	When I spoke to him on Wednesday, I asked him why the rest of Britain should accept this. 
	""The change I propose to the leaders of the parties is not at the expense of the rest of the UK,"" he said. 
	""The regions and the nations in the rest of the UK I think will be quite happy with these changes. 
	""And I think the offer must be open to them, if they wish to pursue the path of further devolution then that is a good thing to do. What we are admitting is that the old UK constitution which was uniform, unitary, centralised, Westminster sovereignty undiluted, that's all going."" 
	And what about even the maintenance of the Barnett formula for public spending? 
	""This is not at the expense of equity for the regions and nations of the UK. Scotland is not asking for anything at the expense of these regions and nations. But the centralising tendencies in London will have to change,"" he told me. 
	Above all Mr Brown regained his political class, the return of a heavyweight prize fighter out of semi-retirement. 
	His speeches displayed the passion of his peak powers as Chancellor in the early 2000s. His final conference speech at Maryhill Community centre could be remembered as one of the greats. The only thing we missed: the opportunity to see him slug it out in debate with Mr Salmond. 
	His motivation was singular, he told me. 
	I asked him if he was enjoying his return to the centre of the debate. ""I'd left frontline politics, I have entered this campaign for one reason only, because I was thinking about my children's future,"" he said. 
	""My children are brought up in Scotland, at school in Scotland. Given this choice could affect their future and their children's future, so someone like me as a father and a parent could not afford to be out of this debate. But I have no desire to be back in frontline politics."" 
	His ideas will now condition a British devolution revolution for at least six months. Much mocked for his accidental claim to have ""saved the world"" in the aftermath of the financial crisis, Mr Brown can now certainly lay claim to having helped save the Union."

	Chief Inspector Jenny Gilmer has ruled out any involvement by a third party in the deaths, which occurred around 9.45am. 
	She said the deaths are still being treated as suspicious, adding that murder-suicide is ""one of the lines of inquiry that our officers will be pursuing, but we must not speculate"". 
	The station was cordoned off for nearly six hours as police gathered evidence from the scene, leading to major disruption for First Great Western passengers. 
	At least 15 services, many of them beginning at London Paddington station, were cancelled and other journeys were delayed. 
	Officers searched the railway tracks and studied CCTV footage at the station. They have also spoken to several witnesses, both on the train and on the platform. 
	Ms Gilmer described the incident as ""very upsetting and distressing for the driver and anyone who witnessed it"". 
	""Officers were called to Slough railway station shortly before 9.45am following reports that two people had been struck by a train,"" she said. 
	""Thames Valley Police and South Central Ambulance also attended the incident and a woman and child were pronounced dead at the scene. 
	""The incident is currently being treated as suspicious and our detectives have launched a full investigation. 
	""But they do not believe there was any third-party involvement at the station. 
	""This is obviously a very tragic incident and our thoughts are very much with those affected."""

	David Cruice told the Hillsborough inquests that his friend became trapped against a crush barrier as the tragedy unfolded in Pen 3 at the stadium's Leppings Lane end during the 1989 FA Cup semi-final. 
	Speaking via a videolink from Miami, Mr Cruice said his friend - named only as Andrew - became bent forward ""at 90 degrees"" over a crush barrier. 
	He said: ""He looked round at me and his face was very, very red. His eyes were sort of very wide and there was significant distress and panic on his face."" 
	The witness described how he tried in vain to pull his friend away from the barrier. He said he feared that, if he could not free him, his friend would die. 
	He said: ""I was screaming or shouting for the people behind Andrew to help me get him off the barrier. I will always remember the sight.Â  
	""Given how much pressure there was and what Andrew was going through, all the people around him were experiencing the same thing - just an unbelievable pressure - it seemed all these hands came over him from behind him and started pulling him back from the barrier as best they could. 
	""Even given the distress that people were in themselves, they were still doing everything they could to help others."" 
	MrÂ Cruice said that, in the panic, he was unable to hold on to his friend's hand and suffered crushing injuries himself. He told the inquests jury the police seemed to be under the impression that people could simply move backwards to ease the pressure on fans at the front of the pen. 
	He said: ""People were screaming at them to open the gates. They were shouting: 'People are dying in here!'"" 
	The Liverpool fan said he returned to the point where he had last seen Andrew once the pressure started to ease and found him supporting himself against the crush barrier. 
	MrÂ Cruice told the Warrington hearing that the policing of the match in was disorganised compared with the previous year's FA cup semi-final at Hillsborough. 
	The hearing has heard that 96 Liverpool fans died at the match against Nottingham Forest following crushing in the central pens at Sheffield Wednesday's ground."
2014-09-23,For Sale: Prehistoric Woolly Mammoth Skeleton,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140923231646/http://news.sky.com/story/1340440/for-sale-prehistoric-woolly-mammoth-skeleton,"By Ashish Joshi, Sky Correspondent A rare woolly mammoth skeleton is being offered for sale in what could be the first auction of its kind in Britain. 
	The specimen is expected to attract interest from museums and private collectors around the world because it is almost fully intact. 
	Mammoth tusks and other parts of the ice-age animals do come up for sale sometimes, but having a whole body together is uncommon. 
	Rupert van Der Werff, director of Summers Place Auctions, which is selling the mammoth, said: ""The buyer could be a private individual or a museum. Nearly complete skeletons are pretty rare. This is a fabulous skeleton in pretty good condition. 
	""All sorts of people are collectors. The most famous ones are John Travolta and Leonardo DiCaprio. It's something to really show off about."" 
	The specimen stands at three-and-half metres high and is more than five-and-a-half metres long. It is thought to be an old male who would have weighed over six tonnes when it was alive. 
	It formed part of an old Eastern European collection and was sold to a private British collector. But its size prevented it being mounted. 
	""Mammoths died out quite a few thousand years ago and this has survived in such a remarkable condition,"" said Mr Werff. 
	""The size of the tusks indicate this was a pretty old and mature animal. 
	""Its bones are pretty robust. It was clearly a big, powerful, healthy animal that had a good long life."" Â  
	Last year a diplodocus skeleton sold at auction for more than Â£400,000. The mystery buyer has now been identified as Copenhagen's Natural History Museum. It is expected to be unveiled next week. 
	London's Natural History Museum did not bid for the dinosaur and has told Sky News it will not try to buy this mammoth. 
	Mr Werff said it was not easy trying to put a price on the prehistoric beast: ""We donât think one has been sold at a British auction before. 
	""We've sold a number of pairs of mammoth tusks, so we've based our evaluation on that and come to an estimate of around Â£150,000 to Â£200,000. But we hope to be proved wrong and it sells for a lot more."" 
	The auction will take place on November 26."
2014-09-23,Tesco Profit Error: New Finance Boss Rushed In,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140923231646/http://news.sky.com/story/1340517/tesco-profit-error-new-finance-boss-rushed-in,"Tesco has managed to secure the services of its new chief financial officer more than two months early - a day after revealing a Â£250m profits error. 
	Alan Stewart had in July quit the same role at Marks & Spencer to join Tesco but was forced to take aÂ period of so-called 'gardening leave'. 
	The supermarket chain said today that he would start work on Tuesday, rather than the previouslyÂ announced date of December 1. 
	Tesco wanted to get Stewart early after revealing on MondayÂ an accounting issue that had led it to overstate its first halfÂ profit forecast by Â£250m. 
	It was later revealed that four executives in its UK business had been suspended as an inquiry examines the way rebates paid by suppliers were treated and whether they were reported in the right time period. 
Its shares lost 12% of their value on the FTSEÂ 100 in the hours after the announcements and the decline continued on Tuesday. 
	Tesco has been without a finance chief since Laurie McIlwee officially left theÂ business earlier this month though Sky News learned today he had not been at its HQ since April - raising further the pressure on chairman Sir Richard Broadbent. 
	The supermarket's new chief executive, Dave Lewis, only started in the job at the beginning of September following the sacking of Philip Clarke on the eve of his 40th anniversary at the retailer. 
	A spokesman for M&S said the firm released Stewart after aÂ personal appeal from Lewis to M&S chief executive Marc Bolland. 
	""It was a request from Dave to Marc ... We felt it was theÂ right thing to do,"" he said, adding that Tesco did not pay any compensation for Stewart's early release. 
	The development emerged as new industry figures showed the extent of the challenge facing Tesco on the shop floor. 
	Kantar Worldpanel reported that while the chain's market share remained unchanged at 28.8% in the 12 weeks to September 14, its sales were down 4.5%. 
	Of the so-called 'Big Four', only AsdaÂ appeared to be holding off the challenge from the hard discounters at the bottom of the market and Waitrose at the top. 
	Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: ""Consumers are currently benefiting from intense price competition between the grocers. 
	""For the first time ever weâve seen the average basket of everyday goods bought today costing exactly the same as it did a year ago.Â  
	""Some staple groceries such as vegetables, milk and bread prices are actually falling as the big retailers all compete for a bigger slice of shoppersâ wallets. 
	""Aldi has continued its run of double-digit growth, which now stretches back to February 2011, by recording a sales increase of 29.1% compared with last year. 
	""Similarly, Lidl has increased sales by 17.7%, showing that shoppers still have a strong appetite for the discount stores. 
	""At the other end of the market Waitrose has grown its sales faster than in previous months, up 4.5%, which has brought its market share back up to 5.1%""."
2014-09-23,Cameron Accused Of 'Bottling It' On TV Debates,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140923231646/http://news.sky.com/story/1340712/cameron-accused-of-bottling-it-on-tv-debates,"David Cameron has been accused of ""bottling it"" over the televised leaders' debates because he refuses to set a date for negotiations. 
	Labour's election campaign chief, Michael Dugher, said the Prime Minister was on the ""slide and run"" and that he would be writing to the Tory Party Chairman Grant Shapps to say ""enough is enough"". 
	He told the Labour Party Conference: ""He says he's up for debating Ed Miliband in the prime ministerial TV debates, but he has been ducking and diving for months."" 
	Mr Dugher, who is in charge of negotiating the terms of the leaders' debates for Mr Miliband, said 20 million people watched the debates in 2010 and that they should not be the ""gift of the Prime Minister"" because they ""belong to the public"". 
	He said he would ask Mr Shapps to ""name their negotiators, fix a time and place for the negotiations to begin and let's get the TV debates sorted"". 
	Mr Cameron is understood to be happy to sign up to three debates - one even including the UKIP leader, Nigel Farage. Speaking to Sky News earlier this year, Mr Shapps said all options were on the table. 
	One suggestion has been a 2-3-5 approach, which would see Mr Cameron debate Mr Miliband, then a debate including Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg followed by a debate including Mr Farage and the Green Party's Natalie Bennett. 
	Britain's first leaders' debates, between Mr Cameron, Gordon Brown and Mr Clegg were shown on Sky News, the BBC and ITV in 2010. 
	This followed negotiations between the parties and TV companies which resulted in strict rules on the style of questioning and the division of time for leaders' answers. 
	Mr Cameron has since complained that the debates ""took all the life out"" of the campaign."
2014-09-23,Tesco Finance Chief 'Absent For Five Months',https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140923231646/http://news.sky.com/story/1340601/tesco-finance-chief-absent-for-five-months,"By Mark Kleinman, City Editor The credibility of Tesco's chairman was thrown into serious doubt on Tuesday when it emerged that the company's outgoing finance director had not been to its head office since soon after resigning more than five months ago. 
	Sky News can exclusively reveal that Philip Clarke, the supermarket chainâs former chief executive, informed Laurie McIlwee in writing in April that he would not be required to attend any of Tesco's corporate premises during his six-month notice period unless specifically asked to do so. 
	The revelation comes the day after Tesco announced that Dave Lewis, its new chief executive, had ordered an urgent inquiry into the apparent overstatement of its half-year profit by an estimated Â£250m. 
	Sir Richard Broadbent, who is coming under mounting pressure to step down as chairman of the UK's biggest retailer, said this week that he was ""not prepared to guess"" when Mr McIlwee had last been involved in any form of corporate decision-making. 
	The chairman declined to say whether it had been ""days or weeks"" that the finance chief had been absent. 
	However, insiders confirmed that no request had been made for Mr McIlwee to undertake any formal duties for Tesco since April. 
	One source said that he had not been to the company's Cheshunt headquarters since the week after his resignation was announced on April 4. 
	Mr McIlwee had also not attended any meetings with either Barclays or Deutsche Bank, Tesco's corporate brokers, or with PricewaterhouseCoopers, its auditor, since then. 
	The disclosure is significant because it raises questions about whether Sir Richard intended to imply that Mr McIlwee had directed the accounting practices which led to the early recognition of supplier payments in an attempt to inflate profits. 
	News of the earnings overstatement for the six months to August 23 sent Tesco's shares plunging and wiped more than Â£1.5bn from its stock market value, triggering one of the gravest crises in its history. 
	Mr McIlwee's resignation was announced on April 4 in a statement which said that he had ""agreed to remain in his role to ensure a smooth handover to his successor"". 
	The statement was designed to reassure shareholders that Tesco would not be left without a key executive role being occupied even as concerns were mounting about its trading performance. 
	However, insiders said that Mr McIlwee resigned as a director of all Tesco group companies in April. 
	Since then, Tesco has been forced to issue three profit warnings and oust Mr Clarke as chief executive. 
	One investor said it was ""deeply concerning"" that Sir Richard had not been fully transparent about Mr McIlwee's lack of involvement with the business since his resignation. 
	The deepening row came as Tesco secured the early arrival of Alan Stewart as Mr McIlwee's replacement. 
	Mr Stewart, who had been due to take up his role in December, joined the supermarket groupâs board on Tuesday following overnight negotiations with Marks & Spencer, his former employer. 
	In a brief statement issued to Sky News on Tuesday, a Tesco spokesman said: ""We set out in April that until he left the company in October Laurie McIlwee would carry out transition activities and support handover with colleagues"". 
	Mr McIlwee could not be reached for comment."

	Hundreds of tanks and vehicles are also involved in the prairie war, with state-of-the-art sensors registering hits and 'kills' - similar to indoor war game Laser Quest. 
	Soldiers have been split into two groups, with one team fighting as Britain and the other as the enemy. 
	Experts have described the exercise, Operation Prairie Storm, as ""Laser Quest plus"" because the simulation lasts eight days and spans 1,160 square miles of Canadian countryside. 
	Simulated suicide vests and laser grenades are also being used. 
	Although the challenge would be a dream come true for many enthusiastic gamers, the training does have a serious side. 
	Every soldier is equipped with sensors which detect whether they have sustained a fatal injury, or if one of their limbs has been damaged during fighting. 
	The teams must rescue one another and deliver first aid under pressure, while a ""God gun"" immediately kills off crucial individuals â such as a commander â to see how his platoon would respond during an emergency. 
	Lt Ian Hodgson is among the soldiers who have flown to Alberta, Canada, for the advanced training. 
	He said: ""If a man is injured or killed in the simulation, the system will tell them that quickly. 
	""It forces us to think quickly and act under pressure, and hopefully brings home the reality of dealing with casualties in the field."" 
	About 1,000 men and women from 1 Yorks, the King's Royal Hussars, the Royal Engineers, the Royal Artillery and other units are fighting as Britain. 
	Roughly 1,000 more will represent the enemy, led by the Royal Household Cavalry, as well as acting as local insurgents and safety co-ordinators."

	A total of 34% of those questioned said the disruption had been handled either very or fairly well, with another 36% saying neither well nor badly and 29% either fairly or very poorly. 
	Passengers complained Twitter provided better information than station staff and only 17% were aware of disruptions before arriving at their station. 
	The survey by Passenger Focus revealed passengers wanted honest, reliable and up-to-the-minute information that painted a realistic picture of problems as they unfolded. 
	Passenger Focus chief executive Anthony Smith said: ""Despite improvements, it is clear that many passengers are still dissatisfied with the way the rail industry deals with delays. 
	""Passengers need information as quickly as possible - ideally before leaving home. Only 17% knew about the disruption before arriving at the station. 
	""For instance, a fallen tree across a railway is just that, not an 'obstruction'. Passengers told the full reasons for the delay are likely to be less frustrated than those who are not. 
	""Passengers now receive information from a range of sources, so train companies must ensure that staff at stations and on trains are ahead of the information game."" 
	The survey findings were based on responses from 1,020 passengers who had experienced a delay in the previous seven days. 
	One customer said: ""I'd have liked an announcement from a human, rather than numbers on a board."" 
	Another said: ""Just the facts - the live departure information is often just a joke. Why cannot Southeastern be honest and just say 'no trains' rather than raising hopes?"" 
	Passenger Focus accepted the tone of announcements needed to signal the train company was ""on the passengers' side"" and could be as important as the content of the messages. 
	Michael Roberts, director general of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents Network Rail and rail operators, said rail companies had worked hard to make improvements. 
	""Passengers are at the heart of what we do and we know they want the industry to provide them with clear, accurate and timely information so they can make informed journey choices,"" he said. 
	""That is why we have worked hard to make improvements and are already committed to implementing many of the report's key recommendations. 
	""The industry will shortly produce a revised plan that includes more prominent service information on websites, earlier notification of any changes to the following day's timetable and measures to boost awareness of how to claim compensation for delayed journeys."""

	Talking to Sky News about modern day pop stars, such as Miley Cyrus, she said: ""Poor little thing, there's nowhere to go. Just take more clothes off."" 
	When asked if she had any tips for the younger generation,Â Faithfull said: ""I really try not to think about them at all if possible. I don't give advice ever. Nobody ever wants it or listens to it."" 
	The 67-year-old singer is releasing a new album, Give My Love To London, to mark her fifth decade in the business, a milestone she is proud of. 
	But don't make the mistake of naming her an icon, as Q magazine did at their annual awards a few years ago. 
	""I thought that rather an insult actually,"" she said. 
	""I think an icon is meaningless, I'm a working artist. To call someone Icon of the Year is ridiculous. So I'm not grateful.""Â  
	Faithfull was well known in the 1960s for dating Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger and guitarist Keith Richards. They lived a drug-fuelled existence together and were part of the 'it' crowd at that time. 
	""I didn't like being famous for that. The pressure is still very bad but I'm well known for being me now, not for anybody I go out with,"" Faithfull revealed. 
	""I didn't like being part of an entourage or a couple or any of that. I hated that. Never again."" 
	To coincide with the release of her album, Faithfull is heading on a European tour next month, something, she says, has its pros and cons. 
	""I hate it. I hate travelling. I love performing but I really hate travelling,"" she said.Â Â  
	With her wild days and cocaine and heroin addictions behind her, FaithfullÂ is philosophical about her 50 years in the music business. 
	""I'm sure there are things I would do differently but I wouldn't call them regrets,"" she said. ""I think it's terribly important not to have regrets. What on earth would I do if I had regrets? I'd be a broken being."""

	If the Latvian has returned to his home country he would also be able to stay there as a free man, the force admitted. 
	A reconstruction of the last-known movements of the teenager will take place on Thursday - four weeks after the 14-year-old went missing. 
	Detectives are hoping it could throw up vital clues from anyone who saw her walking alongside the Grand Union Canal in west London. 
	Convicted killer Zalkalns disappeared at the start of the month and UK police are in Latvia trying to track him down. 
	Police and divers are also continuing to search through the River Brent near Ealing Hospital after a knife - currently undergoing forensic testing - was found in the area earlier this week. 
	The search is the biggest since the 7/7 bombings in London, with 600 officers pursuing more than 700 lines of enquiry, and more than 1,000 people having been spoken to. 
	Thursday's reconstruction will see a police cadet walk the canal-side route that Alice took on August 28 in the hope witnesses could remember a small, but potentially important detail. 
	CCTV recorded the teenager as she made her way back to her home in the Hanwell area of west London, and also filmed Zalkalns cycling past the same spot 15 minutes later. 
	Detectives believe he is likely to have seen Alice as they were both going north along the towpath. 
	The Latvian has not entered his homeland by plane but could have made his way there by road. 
	Zalkalns, who served seven years in prison for killing his wife and burying her in a forest after a dispute about her sexuality, has not been seen since September 3 and has not used his phone or bank account. 
	The labourer was also arrested on suspicion of indecently assaulting a 14-year-old girl in the UK in 2009, but no further action was taken. 
	Scotland Yard, meanwhile, has said it is reviewing the early stages of the investigation after coming under fire for being too slow to ask Latvian authorities for help.

2014-09-24,MPs To Vote On Airstrikes Against Islamic State,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140924200410/http://news.sky.com/story/1341620/mps-to-vote-on-airstrikes-against-islamic-state,"David Cameron is to recall Parliament on Friday to ask MPs to support UK airstrikes against Islamic State (IS) militants in Iraq. 
	MPs will vote on whether RAF planes should join the US, France and five Arab states in bombarding IS positions. 
	The airstrikes could take place as early as the weekend. 
	A Downing Street spokesman said: ""The Speaker has agreed to the Prime Minister's request to recall Parliament this Friday to debate the UK's response to the request from the Iraqi Government for airstrikes to support operations against ISIL in Iraq."" 
	The PM will be hoping to avoid the defeat he suffered last year over plans to target the Assad regime in Syria, but looks to have the support of the two other main party leaders. 
	Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the Liberal Democrats would support airstrikes, pointing out they are ""legal"" because they had been requested by the Iraqi government. 
	""There are many people across the country who see what this medieval murderous organisation does, slaughtering people regardless of their ethnicity or their religion; an organisation which is actively plotting to do us harm in this country,"" he said. 
	""I think most people across the country want the British Government to play our part in ridding the world of this vile threat."" 
Labour leader Ed MilibandÂ said Britain could not turn away from tackling IS and said he would consider a proposition from the PM. 
	Sky's Defence Correspondent Alistair Bunkall said Brimstone, Paveway and Storm Shadow missiles have been flown to RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus in readiness for airstrikes. 
	He added: ""I think it would be safe to assume that a Royal Naval submarine is being pre-positioned in the region, ready to launch Tomahawk cruise missiles when the order comes. 
	""The TLAMs, as they're known, have a range of 1,000 miles and can hit targets with pinpoint accuracy. They can also beam back live images of the battlefield to the submarine."" 
	Tom Newton Dunn, Political Editor of The Sun, told Sky News it was ""quite likely"" Britain would carry out airstrikesÂ in Iraq by the end of the weekend. 
	""But it will be a couple of bombs - it will be symbolic,"" he added. 
	UKIP leader Nigel Farage accused Mr Cameron of recalling Parliament on Friday to disrupt his party's conference. 
	""It's widely believed Prime Minister David Cameron held back on recalling Parliament on an issue of massive national importance, so it didn't affect the Labour Party conference, which finished today,"" he said. 
	""However, he still thought it best to delay parliamentary recall until Friday, and not do it tomorrow. Instead he will make his statement in the middle of the UKIP party conference."" 
	Mr Cameron is at the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York, where he was formally asked by Iraqi counterpart Haider AbadiÂ to join US-led airstrikes. 
	Earlier, the PM met Iran's PresidentÂ Hassan Rouhani - the first such encounter in decades. 
	It comes as the US military launched five more airstrikes targeting IS, including one in eastern Syria near the Iraqi border, two west of Baghdad and two southeast of Irbil. 
Meanwhile, a 19-year-old British jihadiÂ was reportedly killed in a US airstrike in Aleppo, Syria."

	The man, from Brighton, East Sussex, is thought to have been fighting for al Nusra, an affiliate group of al Qaeda, in Aleppo, The Guardian said. 
	The newspaper named him as Ibrahim Kamara, and said his nom de guerre was Khalid al Britani. 
	Al Nusra has been fighting against both the Syrian government and Islamic State militants in the country's civil war. 
	The Foreign Office said they are ""aware of the reports"", and are trying to verify them. 
	A picture posted on Facebook appears to show MrÂ Kamara's face in an unzipped body bag covered in fine sand, The Guardian said. 
	He reportedly studied at Brighton's Vardean College for one year to resit his GCSE exams. 
	His mother, Khadijah Kamara, 35, said she felt numb and confused when she was told her eldest son was dead. 
	""It's confusing. I don't know what I felt or how I am feeling,"" she told The Guardian. 
	She said she knew he was going to die when she found out he was in Syria, and came close to disowning him. 
	""He called me in February. He said: 'Mum, I'm in Syria', and I hung up. He rang again and I said: 'Don't ever call me.'"""

	Three British crew members from West Yorkshire are being held over the seizure, and a fourth man has been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to import cocaine. 
	The drugs have an estimated street value of â¬70mÂ to â¬80m (Â£54.8m to Â£62.6m). 
	A spokesman for Defence Forces Ireland told Sky News it was one of Ireland's biggest drug hauls of the last 10 years. 
	It is understood the men on board the MakayabellaÂ put up no resistance and were arrested when they arrived on shore. 
	The ship was identified by the National Crime Agency, which asked the Irish Navy for it to be intercepted. 
	A joint sea operation byÂ the Revenue Customs Service, the Naval Service and An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na soon followed. 
	In a statement, the Joint Task Force (JTF) said the operation, which began in the early hours of Tuesday morning, took place in ""challenging conditions"" 200 to 300 miles south-west of Mizen Head, Ireland's most southerly point. 
	It involved two naval vessels and a number of interagency personnel. 
	""The LEÂ NIAMH supported by LE ROISIN positively identified a suspect vessel in a covert surveillance operation,"" it said. 
	""The decision was made by the JTF situated in the Naval Operations Command Centre in Haulbowline to deploy an armed Naval boarding party, which resulted in the successful detention by Revenueâs Customs Service of the yacht, suspected contraband and the crew of three."" 
	Ireland's Defence Minister Simon CoveneyÂ has congratulated all the agencies involved for their ""pivotal role in the success of the operation"". 
	It is believed the ship was destined for north Wales."
2014-09-24,Ed Miliband Forgets To Mention The Deficit,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140924200410/http://news.sky.com/story/1341142/ed-miliband-forgets-to-mention-the-deficit,"Ed Miliband is facing criticism after he forgot to mention the deficit during his 66-minute speech to the Labour Party conference. 
	In his last party conference speech before the General Election, the Labour leader set out his intention to put the NHS at the heart of the party's plan for the next 10 years. 
	However, speaking without notes, he left out entirely a passage on reducing the country's Â£75bn deficit. 
	The Labour leader told Sky News: ""I cannot simply memorise a whole speech ..."" 
	He said: ""There was a bit I didn't deliver that was pre-prepared."" 
	But he insisted that the whole speech was effectively about the economy. 
	He added: ""I could have done it with autocue but I think what people want is somebody who will come and talk to them directly."" 
	But he said he did not consider the speech had been a failure because he had delivered a message full of substance. 
	George Osborne tweeted immediately after the speech, which was overshadowed halfway through by Barack Obama's press conference on airstrikes in Syria and Iraq, to point out the omission. 
	A pre-prepared version of Mr Milibandâs speech briefed to journalists and posted on Labour.org.uk on Tuesday afternoon contained a section on reducing Britain's deficit, however it was left out of his delivery. 
	He was also criticised by Conservative MP Harry Smith, who said: ""Ed Miliband has let the cat out of the bag â he has no plan to deal with the deficit and no plan for the economy."" 
	A Labour source explained it had been a slip and told Sky News: ""This was a long speech and some things changed in delivery. He made clear no plans for additional borrowing."" 
	Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said Mr Miliband ""failed to offer any serious plan to grow the economy"". 
	He added: ""Labour simply don't have a long-term economic plan to secure a better future for Britain. Our country, our children and our grandchildren would be worse off under Ed Miliband's weak leadership."" 
	Shadow chancellor Ed Balls had made reducing the deficit the centrepiece of his speech on Monday. 
	Speaking without notes, Mr Miliband outlined his six national goals: 
:: To reward people for hard work - raising the national minimum wage to half the number of people on low pay 
:: To tackle the cost of living crisis and make sure wages increased with economic growth, breaking up banks and taking power from Whitehall 
::Â Britain to create a million jobs in green industries - helping to tackle global climate change 
:: Making sure as many school leavers go on to apprenticeships as go to university. Companies who employ foreign workers will be expected to offer apprenticeships too, and those who want Government contracts will need to provide apprenticeships 
:: Making the dream of home-ownership a reality by building more homes and making sure 400,000 first-time buyers a year get on property ladder 
:: Save the NHS - provide a ""truly 21st century health service"" using the proceeds of a mansion tax on homes above Â£2m and a tax on tobacco firms"

	Harry Smith moved audience members to tears as he made a passionate case for the NHSÂ and warned David Cameron: ""Keep your mitts off my NHS."" 
	Mr Smith received a number of standing ovations as he detailed his life in a ""barbarous, bleak and uncivilised"" Barnsley slum where he listened to the screams of a woman dying of cancer because she could not afford the medicine to dull the pain. 
	His eight-minute speech came after a poorly received 66-minute keynote by the Labour leader on Tuesday, which was roundly condemned after it emerged he forgot to mention the deficit. 
	Political pundits were hailing Mr Smith's speech as a lesson to Mr Miliband in delivery, saying he had managed to make a powerful case for the NHS in a way the leader had failed to. 
	Steve Hawkes, deputy political editor, of the Sun, tweeted: ""91 year-old Harry Smith shows Ed Miliband how to do it - rousing speech (from autocue) that gets delegates on their feet."" 
	Another Twitter user, Robert Bennett, wrote: ""Harry Smith 91 years didn't forget any of his speech."" 
	While another, Mark Robinson, tweeted: ""Such a contrast between Harry Smith's speech and Ed Miliband's."" 
	Labour politicians, including the shadow health secretary Andy Burnham, wept openly as he described how his sister had to be buried in a paupers' pit after dying of tuberculosis at the age of 10. 
	He said the family watched as she faded away, unable to help because they ""just didn't have the dosh to keep her comfortable"". 
	Mr Smith said that eventually she was sent to die in a workhouse infirmary because her mother could no longer care for her. 
	Mr Smith told the conference: ""In my heart, I can still feel my mum and dad's desperation as they were trying to keep our family safe and healthy in the slum we called home. 
	""Common disease controlled our neighbourhood and snuffed out life like a cold breath on a warm candlelit flame."" 
	He said he was born in 1923 to a life that was nothing like an episode of Downton Abbey, where hospitals and doctors were for the privileged few. 
	But he said while his heart was with the children of his generation who did not make it, it was also with the people of the present who were struggling because of welfare cuts and austerity measures. 
	He finished: ""Today we must be vigilant. We must never ever let the NHS free from our grasp because if we do, your future will be my past. 
	""My life is your history and we should keep it that way. 
	""So say it loud and say in clear in this hall and across this country, Mr Cameron, keep your mitts off my NHS."""
2014-09-24,'Racist' Exhibition Closes Amid Boycott Calls,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140924200410/http://news.sky.com/story/1341656/racist-exhibition-closes-amid-boycott-calls,"By Afua Hirsch, Social Affairs Editor An international exhibition depicting a ""human zoo"" has been forced to close after heated protests. 
	""Exhibit B"", a live installation by white South African artist Brett Bailey, features black actors shackled and chained in cages and claims to explore the legacy of slavery and racial oppression. 
	But after a petition against the show attracted almost 23,000 signatures online, it was finally forced to close on its opening night in London, amid claims it is racist. 
	""We are protesting against this exhibition because it's fundamentally racist and it's disrespectful to the memory of our ancestors, and the great pain and suffering they went through to this day,"" said Sara Myers, who organised the protest and the petition. 
	""You don't challenge racism by creating racism. I think it's deeply disturbing that to look at the atrocities of colonialism, you need to go back and look at black people in chains, with tape measures around their heads. There are better ways of doing that."" 
	Mr Bailey did not want to speak to Sky News, but his exhibition has been defended by the Barbican, which was hosting the show in London. 
	In a statement, it wrote: ""Last night, as Exhibit B was opening at the Vaults, it became impossible for us to continue with the show because of the extreme nature of the protest and the serious threat to the safety of performers, audiences and staff. 
	""We find it profoundly troubling that such methods have been used to silence artists and performers, and that audiences have been denied the opportunity to see this important work. 
	""Exhibit B raises, in a serious and responsible manner, issues about racism. It has previously been shown in 12 cities, involved 150 performers and been seen by around 25,000 people with responses from participants, audiences and critics alike being overwhelmingly positive."" 
	But one dancer, who appeared in the exhibition in Paris, said she could understand the anger of anti-racism campaigners. 
	""White people can put on an exhibition like this, but when we â whose ancestors experienced the suffering of slavery, colonialism and racism â want to tell our story, curators do not want to run it,"" said Chantal Loial, a choreographer and dancer who performs an ode to 18th century slave and ""freak show"" exhibition Saartjie Baartman, who is also known as Hottentot Venus. 
	""They say we are not distant enough to do something like this. And black people, they are really fed up with this."""
2014-09-24,Freed Abu Qatada 'Will Not Be Returning To UK',https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140924200410/http://news.sky.com/story/1341176/freed-abu-qatada-will-not-be-returning-to-uk,"Home Secretary Theresa May has insisted Abu Qatada will not be returning to the UK, as the preacher was pictured falling to the floor in an emotional reunion with supporters. 
	The radical preacher was facing charges over the so-called ""millennium plot"" to bomb Western tourists during New Year celebrations in Jordan. 
	But the 53-year-old is now starting a new life as a free man after the judge decided there was not enough evidence to convict him. 
	Abu Qatada was deported from the UK last year following a long-running battle by the Home Office which cost millions of pounds. 
	The Palestinian-Jordanian preacher was once referred to as ""Osama Bin Laden's right-hand man in Europe"" by a Spanish judge. 
	Home Secretary Theresa May said it was still the right decision to deport him. 
	She said: ""The UK courts here were very clear that Abu Qatada posed a threat to our national security. That's why we we were pleased, as a Government, to be able to remove him. 
	""He is subject to a deportation order. He is also subject to a UN-travel ban - that means he will not be returning to the UK."" 
	Sky's Tom Rayner, at the trial in Amman, said AbuÂ Qatada seemed to be expecting the verdict and gave a ""wink and a kind of smile"" to his family when he stepped into the caged dock. 
	The preacher's supporters were in raptures, with family members in tears when the judge handed down his verdict in the Jordanian capital. 
	Abu Qatada had already been acquitted in June over a series of 1998 bomb plots. 
	The cleric had previously been convicted and sentenced on both charges by a trial in absentia, but had avoided Jordanian justice after getting asylum in the UK. 
	He lost his refugee status in 2002 when he was detained on suspicion of terrorism offences, and was held in indefinite detention at high-security prisons, such as Belmarsh, but never stood trial. 
	Abu Qatada was eventually thrown out of the country in July 2013 after a high-profile campaign by the Government, which argued he was a threat to national security. 
	It came after a ""memorandum of understanding"" between the UK and Jordan assured he would receive a fair trial. 
	The agreement stipulated that although he would be tried in a military-security court, the case would be heard by a civilian judge. 
	Crucially, it also said that evidence which may have been acquired through torture would not be eligible in the case. 
	With that guarantee in place, Tom Rayner added ""the judge said there simply wasn't enough evidence to convict him"". 
	He said: ""The real question is what he will do here in Jordan. He is a renowned jihadist figure, he is a known al Qaeda sympathiser."" 
	Rayner added that AbuÂ Qatada's criticism of Islamic State could ironically make him a ""stabilising force"" within the country in case extremists were thinking of a backlash over the country's support for US airstrikes."
2014-09-24,What Now For Abu Qatada After Aquittal?,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140924200410/http://news.sky.com/story/1341570/what-now-for-abu-qatada-after-aquittal,"By Tom Rayner, Middle East Reporter, in Amman, Jordan Only a man sure he was on the verge of freedom would smile walking into a cage, flanked by armed police in a high-security court. 
	Abu Qatada exuded confidence from behind the bars of the dock. 
	It took only a few minutes for the judge to read out the verdict. 
	He said there was simply not enough evidence for a conviction on involvement in a plan to attack Israeli and western tourists during millennium celebrations. 
	Having been cleared in June of another charge related to alleged bomb plot in 1998, the man once dubbed ""Bin Laden's right-hand man in Europe"" was cleared of all the accusations he had been convicted of in absentia 14 years ago. 
	The Home Office was quick to say that Abu Qatada would not be able to return to Britain, regardless of the verdict, but it's not entirely clear that he would want to, even if he was able to. 
	Qatada's battle against extradition was always grounded on the claim that he would not receive a fair trial in Jordan. 
	His lawyers insisted the testimonies that formed the evidence against him were obtained under torture. 
	The agreement that no such testimonies would be used in his retrial was key to his deportation last year. 
	Now the trial has taken place and his acquittal secured, there are many reasons why Abu Qatada may be content to stay in Jordan. 
	Key among them is the rise of Islamic State - a crisis that Abu Qatada may feel he can influence most effectively from the region. 
	As he left court, journalists mobbed him. 
	Desperate to get his response not just to his acquittal, but to get his view on the airstrikes against IS â the group whose behaviour he has already denounced as counter to Islam. 
	It's clear, perhaps because of his notoriety, Abu Qatada remains one of the world's most influential jihadist thinkers. 
	""I don't think Abu Qatada is involved in terrorist organisations, otherwise he'd have been found guilty,"" said his friend, Jordanian analyst of jihadi movements, Marwan Shehadeh. 
	""But he's one of the main mentors for jihadist groups â and he's a Sheikh, a scholar of sharia law, and so he gives fatwas in relation to jihad."" 
	Shehadeh believes the rise of Islamic State has divided global jihadist thinking, and added: ""There are two wings â one is represented by (Jordanian jihadist Abu Musab al)Â Zarqawi, which is now Islamic State, the other is the views of Bin Laden, which is al Qaeda. 
	""I think Abu Qatada is more supportive of al Qaeda than IS. He judges the actions by looking to sharia law, and makes fatwas based on that."" 
	But Shehadeh also warned regional governments not to count on Qatada's condemnation of Islamic State, neutering the potential for a backlash in their own countries. 
	He said: ""Of course he is against the alliance â the campaign to target IS, al Nusra and other factions ... I think soon he will release statement against the alliance and the airstrikes."" 
	Many are already watching how Abu Qatada uses his new freedom."
2014-09-24,iPods Save 750 Lives During Hospital Trials,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140924200410/http://news.sky.com/story/1340999/ipods-save-750-lives-during-hospital-trials,"By Lisa Dowd, Sky Correspondent The lives of more than 750 patients have been saved at two hospitals after nurses started using iPods instead of paper charts to record patients' vital signs. 
	Research published in the British Medical Journal found that in one year the number of deaths at Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth fell by 397 following the introduction of the new system. 
	At University Hospital Coventry 372 fewer patients died. The system has been trialled at the West Midlands hospital since 2007. 
	The special software automatically calculates if a patient is deteriorating and sends out alerts. 
	Staff have found the system is cutting down mistakes and saving time. 
	Nurse Amy-Dawn Lees uses an iPod to record a patient's blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen levels and temperature, as well as tapping in how a patient is feeling. 
	""The old paper charts were very, very difficult to decipher; the crosses, the arrows, written on the chart by the previous nurse. You can't actually distinguish exactly where the cross is,"" said Ms Lees. 
	""On the new electronic charts everything is colour-coded, you are able to see the previous observations in more detail, more accurately and obviously able to see whether your patient is the same, better or worse."" 
	Data from each iPod goes into a central computer system, which doctors, nurses and managers can access. 
	Patients across all wards are given a score of between 0 and 21. 
	""We have patients in today with high scores varying from 6, where we're starting to be concerned, to 11, which is the sickest patient we have,"" said Dr Duncan Watson, Clinical Director of Critical Care at University Hospital. 
	Doctors and nurses are also alerted to patients' needs by colour codes. Red signifies patients who need the most attention. 
	""It's radically changed things for us,"" added Dr Watson. 
	""It has decreased the mortality rates for the hospital, we are able to identify 10 patients a week and prevent them coming into the intensive care units, we can decrease their length of stay and the patients actually do better as they don't get as sick and we identify them quicker."" 
	The system is expensive, according to Dr Watson - but it has the potential to save money long-term. 
	More importantly, across the two hospitals death rates have fallen by 15%. 
	Most hospital trusts still use a paper system, but University Hospital is now almost paper-free."
2014-09-24,Fact Check: Do Ed Miliband's Claims Stack Up?,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140924200410/http://news.sky.com/story/1340974/fact-check-do-ed-milibands-claims-stack-up,"Ed Miliband has set out his six goals for Britain's future in his speech to the Labour conference. So how do some of his claims fare under closer scrutiny? 
:: Claim One: The number of apprenticeships for young people has fallen under the current government 
	This is true for young people under 19. The number starting apprenticeships fell from 129,900 in the 2011/12 academic year to 114,500 in the 2012/13 academic year. The apparent small fall from the previous year is possibly due to a minor change in the way they were counted. 
	Apprenticeship starts for those aged 19-24 and 25 upwards increased between 2010/11 and 2011/12 before remaining at a similar level in 2012/13, with the biggest increase among those aged over 25. 
	The Institute for Public Policy Research has suggested the increase could be due in part to companies shifting their employees onto apprenticeships in order to access government funding. 
Claim Two: Wages rising slower than prices for 50 out of 51 months 
	There are all sorts of ways to measure the ""cost of living"" but one of the most common is to compare the rises in prices and wages. 
	Real wages - wages adjusted for prices - have been falling since 2008 as price rises have outstripped wage increases. 
	This measure alone is limited: it doesn't say anything about how household incomes have changed - this includes, for instance, the effects of tax and benefit changes. 
	The Institute for Fiscal Studies calculates the median income fell by 5.8% between 2009-10 and 2012-13. 
Claim Three: Housebuilding is at its lowest since the 1920s 
	This is correct, apart from housebuilding during Second World War, according to figures for England and Wales. 
	Ed Miliband said a Labour government would aim to double the number of first-time buyers who get on the housing ladder each year by 2025. 
	Historical data to 2010 suggests the number of first-time buyers is at a fairly low level, with about 200,000 loans given to first-time buyers in 2010. 
	This excludes those buying a house outright for the first time, without a mortgage. 
	More recent data from the Council of Mortgage Lenders suggests the figure has been increasing, with first-time buyer loans in June 2014 up 18% on the same time in 2013, but there is no annual data available to compare back. 
Claim Four: Britain is behind Germany, Japan, the US, India and China for low-carbon green technologies and services. 
	According to government figures, in 2011/12 the UK was ranked sixth globally overall for its low carbon and environmental goods and services sector, with the US, China, Japan, India and Germany making up the top five. 
	So although this claim seems to be correct, these are the only countries that the UK is behind. 
	The UK's green goods and services market was valued at just over Â£128bn in 2011/12, Â£17bn less than Germany but around Â£24bn more than France (which was 7th). 
Claim Five: One in five workers finds themselves on low pay 
	The average UK worker earns about Â£11.62 an hour, and just over 20% earn less than two-thirds of that (Â£7.75), often defined as ""low pay"". 
	This is very close to the Living Wage currently set at Â£7.65 nationally (apart from a higher rate for London). 
	Just over five million people in the UK earn the Living Wage or less; again close to one in five of all UK workers. 
	The Minimum Wage represents lower pay still. Ed Miliband has pledged this will rise to Â£8 by 2020 under a Labour government. 
	This is likely to be a real-terms increase if inflation continues at current levels. For the last few years, the Minimum Wage has increased by less than inflation. 
Claim Six: One in four people have to wait a week or more for a GP appointment. 
	The latest survey for NHS England shows 14% of those who tried to see or speak to someone at their GP surgery got an appointment a week or more after they phoned up, while 11% didn't get one at all. 
	But not everybody wanted an appointment straight away - 14% of patients didn't have a particular day in mind for an appointment, and 6% wanted an appointment a week or more later."
2014-09-24,Tesco Profit Error: Could Something Be Amiss?,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140924200410/http://news.sky.com/story/1340272/tesco-profit-error-could-something-be-amiss,"By Ian King, Business Presenter Even from a lesser company, three profits warnings inside a year would be startling. 
	Coming from a blue-chip stalwart like Tesco, it is nothing short of astonishing. 
	In issuing a profits warning on top of a profits warning, Britain's biggest food retailer almost seems to be taking to an extreme the strategy so commonly seen in its stores, with three for the price of two. 
	So what exactly has Dave Lewis, the new chief executive, uncovered? 
	Well, in its own words, Tesco has identified an overstatement of its expected profit for the half-year, principally due to the accelerated recognition of commercial income and delayed accrual of costs. 
	In other words, the reporting of costs incurred in the first half of the year appears to have been delayed so they are pushed into the second half, while profits enjoyed during the second half of the year appear to have been brought forward into the first half. 
	It is unclear what kind of activities generated these profits, but commercial income, with regard to supermarkets, could mean rebates from third-party suppliers or payments from those suppliers to incentivise Tesco to give their goods better positions when they are displayed in its stores. 
	This latter practice is common place in the supermarket sector and, having worked previously at Unilever, Mr Lewis will be familiar with it. 
	The overall effect of these two actions will have been to pretty-up Tesco's first-half numbers. 
	Cynics will suggest Mr Lewis has every reason to restate the numbers lower - after all, the period, the six months to August 23, was when his predecessor, Philip Clarke, was at the helm. 
	Some would say it is in Mr Lewis' interests to ensure that period is painted in as bad a light as possible in order to make any subsequent turnaround under him look better. 
	It's known as ""kitchen sinking"" in the City - where every possible bad bit of news, including the proverbial kitchen sink, is thrown into the accounts to make them look bad. 
	But the sheer size of this overstatement, Â£250m, would suggest this is a bit more serious. 
	So is Mr Lewis' response: the suspension of four of Tesco's UK executives, his recruitment of the top City lawyers Freshfields to investigate and his hiring of outside auditors from Deloitte - Tesco's regular auditor is PwC - to examine what has happened. 
	At this time, there is no suggestion that anything illegal has been happening. After all, all businesses occasionally recognise revenues early or take their time to recognise costs in the accounts. 
	Yet the sheer aggression of the accounting policy in this instance and Mr Lewis' response to discovering it rather suggests he thinks something may be amiss. 
	And, with plenty of American investors - who tend to be more litigious than their European counterparts - on Tesco's shareholder base,Â  he is doing the prudent thing in checking this out as thoroughly as possible."

	But it feels as though some parts of Labour history are still no-go areas. 
	In particular, one would almost think there is a conspiracy of silence when it comes to the two most dominant figures of recent Labour history - Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. 
	Nobody in Manchester wants to talk about Tony Blair. Since this conference hall played host to his farewell speech as Labour leader, he has been an ever-absent at party gatherings. 
	Perhaps more surprising given his recent success in Scotland is the reluctance to give Gordon Brown his due. 
	Ed Miliband, in an impromptu speech to the hall, thanked all and sundry involved in the Labour campaign, from Alistair Darling to Johann Lamont and Anas Sarwar, and yet neglected to mention the man that some are crediting with saving the Union. 
	It leaves one with the sense that in Labour's hurry to move on and look to the future, it can at times seem as though the party is afraid of grappling with the big figures of its past."
2014-09-24,24-Hour Tube Launch Date Is Revealed,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140924200410/http://news.sky.com/story/1341101/24-hour-tube-launch-date-is-revealed,"London's Tube trains are set to operate a 24-hour service at weekends from September 12 next year, it has been announced. 
	Night-time journeys in the capital are expected to be cut by 20 minutes on average, with some journeys expected to be reduced by up to one hour. 
	Transport For London said the new service, first promised by Mayor Boris Johnson and London Underground last November, had been made possible due to modernisation of the network and improved levels of reliability. 
	The launch of the ""Night Tube"" service will coincide with the Rugby World Cup, which is being hosted in England in September and October. 
	Fans attending at any of the three venues in London - Twickenham Stadium, Olympic Stadium and Wembley Stadium - will able to make use of the new service. 
	Mr Johnson said: ""London is a bustling, 24-hour global city and by this time next year we'll have a 24-hour Tube service to match. 
	""Running trains all through the night was once thought impossible, but with the huge investment we've put in and upgrades that have been delivered we stand ready to take the Tube to the next level."" 
	To meet the expected demand of the new service, there will be six trains per hour through central London on all Night Tube lines, including the Jubilee, Victoria and most of the Piccadilly, Central and Northern lines. 
	There will be eight trains per hour on the Northern line to meet demand at busy stations between Leicester Square and Camden Town. 
	Mike Brown, managing director of London Underground, said: ""We are now less than a year away from the first ever 24-hour services operating on London Underground. 
	""Already over half a million Londoners use the Tube after 10pm on Fridays and Saturdays, and the introduction of the Night Tube, which will cut journey times and open up new possibilities across the night time economy, is a historic step in our modernisation of the Underground."" 
	While rail unions welcome the move, they have asked for talks with Transport for London managers to ensure it will not be a low cost, low management service. 
	Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, said: ""With Boris still wanting to axe 900 jobs and close all ticket offices, we want to ensure that the new service is properly staffed to ensure safe and secure travel for all passengers and that weekend maintenance work is not postponed to disrupt weekday services."""

	David Miller, 24, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, were found dead on Sairee beach on September 15. Both had suffered severe head injuries. 
	Police are searching for the son of a former village headman who left the island a day after the pair's bodies were found, according to reports. 
	The man landed on the Surat Thani coast and then disappeared. He is believed to be in Bangkok, the Phuket Gazette reported. 
	Officers believe at least three men were involved in the attack on Mr Miller, from Jersey, and Miss Witheridge, from Great Yarmouth in Norfolk. 
	A bloodstained garden hoe found near their bodies is believed to have been the murder weapon. 
	Post-mortem examinations revealed Ms Witheridge died from head wounds while Mr Miller suffered severe blows to the head and subsequently drowned. 
	A spokesman for the Royal Thai Police on Monday said police were investigating reports that the pair had earlier argued with a Thai man in a bar. 
	Police chief Kissana Phathanacharoen said on Sunday his officers were looking into reports suggesting the murders might have been connected with ""sexual jealousy"". 
	He said: ""We have discovered fresh evidence which could lead to a new suspect who may have had a relationship or one-night stand with Hannah or one of her friends or David the night before they were killed."" 
	Ian Miller, David's father, earlier this week said he thought his son might have intervened to help Hannah Witheridge during an argument. 
	""It has become clearer and clearer that it is quite likely David was stepping in to help a girl who was in trouble,"" he told the Daily Mail. 
	Around 150 police have been sent to the island to try to find the killers. 
	Last week, unconfirmed reports claimed the DNA of two Asian men was found on Ms Witheridge's body. 
	A group of Burmese migrants interviewed by police officers after bloodstains were found on their clothing were eliminated from inquiries last week."
2014-09-24,Car Insurance: New Rules To Reduce Costs,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140924200410/http://news.sky.com/story/1341135/car-insurance-new-rules-to-reduce-costs,"A regulator has published new rules it hopes will boost competition to help bring down the cost of premiums in the UK's Â£11bn private motor insurance market. 
	The clampdown may knock up to Â£20 off a typical bill under the Competition and Markets Authority's (CMA) plan. 
	Among its headline measures is a ban on exclusivity agreements between price comparison websitesÂ and insurers that prevent companies making their products available more cheaply online. 
	The CMAÂ also demanded better information for consumers on the costs and benefits of no-claims bonus protection. 
	But it ""reluctantly"" decided not to recommend any changes to the current system of providing replacement hire cars for drivers following an accident, despite the fact they increase the average insurance premium by Â£3 a year. 
	The CMA said there was ""no appropriate remedy"", but the Association of British Insurers (ABI) said it was ""bad news for consumers"" and said the watchdog had ""ducked"" the issue. 
	The measures follow wider efforts to bring down the cost to drivers of personal injury claims andÂ fraud, with premiums falling 19% in the last year aloneÂ to a four-year low. 
	Alasdair Smith, chairman of the private motor insurance investigation group at the CMA, said: ""There are over 25 million privately registered cars in the UK and we think these changes will benefit motorists who are currently paying higher premiums as a result of the problems weâve found. 
	""There need to be improvements to the way price comparison websites operate. 
	""They certainly help motorists look for the best deal, and this in turn has led insurers to compete more intensely, but we want to see an end to clauses which restrict an insurerâs ability to price its products differently on different online channels. 
	""We expect this to lead to greater competition between price comparison websites."" 
	He also moved to explain the lack of action on the cost ofÂ post-accident services to drivers who are not at fault in an accident, in particular temporary replacement cars. 
	He said: ""Reluctantly we have had to conclude that we cannot see an effective way of addressing this problem fully short of a fundamental change in the law and, whilst this problem does increase premiums for motorists, the extent of the problem is not as high as was at first envisaged and does not warrant such a radical measure. 
	""However, we do wish to challenge the benchmarks typically used in awards for non-fault replacement cars, which do not reflect the cost of the services provided and which we think should be lower."" 
	James Dalton, theÂ ABIâsÂ head of motor insurance, said: ""Todayâs CMA report is the culmination of three years of work and has cost taxpayers millions of pounds. 
	""The fact that it fails to do anything to address the excessive costs of replacement vehicles - a problem that the CMA itself identified - will be a bitter pill to swallow for honest motorists. 
	""Far from reducing the cost of car insurance, the CMAâs inaction simply entrenches the business models of some replacement vehicle providers who profit from inflating car hire charges at the consumerâs expense. 
	""The reality is that the CMA has ducked this challenge and when regulators fail, politicians need to step in to act."""

	Ms Sturgeon said if a second referendum was in the Scottish National Party (SNP) manifesto then it would be a mandate for her to push for another vote on independence for Scotland. 
	And she added she was not bound to wait for another ""generation"" before putting the matter to the Scottish electorate again. 
	The 44-year-old she said she was not preparing for a referendum, but warned Westminster it needed to deliver on the promises it had made to the Scottish people. 
	She said: ""If I am elected to lead, I pledge today that the SNP and the Scottish Government will be full, active, genuine and constructive participants in that process of change, wherever it happens - in Holyrood, in meeting rooms and, most importantly of all, in discussions across Scotland. 
	""There will be no sitting on the sidelines."" 
	She said the deal on further powers for Holyrood must be one ""that maximises devolution in substance not just in rhetoric"". 
	Ms Sturgeon is the clear favourite to succeed Alex Salmond after he announced last week he would be stepping down following the No vote. 
	Launching her leadership bid, Ms Sturgeon said: ""I am putting myself forward for two simple reasons: I want to serve my party and my country. And I believe I am the best person for the job. 
	""I also hope that my candidacy, should it succeed, will send a strong message to every girl and young woman in Scotland: no matter your background or what you want to achieve in life, in Scotland in 2014 there is no glass ceiling on ambition."" 
	Should Ms Sturgeon be successful in her bid then all three of the leaders of the main parties in the Scottish Parliament will be women. 
	Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont and Conservative leader Ruth Davidson both played significant parts in the Better Together referendum campaign. 
	The only male party leader is the Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie."

	One of his own former ministers in the devolved government had claimed Mr Robinson would resign before the next election to the Assembly at Stormont. 
	Edwin Poots, who was axed as health minister in Tuesday's reshuffle, told BBC Radio Ulster the party leader's plans to go were ""public knowledge"". 
	But Mr Robinson, who has been First Minister for six years, immediately issued a statement dismissing any talk of his imminent departure from office. 
	Mr Robinson said: ""Neither now, nor before the Assembly election, have I any plans to stand down and the public and media can be confident that when I decide such a moment has arrived, I will be the one to make the announcement. 
	""I repeat the comments I have previously made that I will continue to lead as long as the part and the electorate in East Belfast wish me to do so."" 
	In a reshuffle announced on Twitter, Mr Robinson replaced Mr Poots with Jim Wells and Social Development Minister Nelson McCausland with Mervyn Storey. 
	The claim and counterclaim appear to confirm growing speculation of a split in the party once led by the Rev Ian Paisley. 
	In an interview last year, Rev Paisley, who died two weeks ago, claimed he had been forced out by Mr Robinson and his allies. 
	Mr Robinson voluntarily stood down for six weeks in 2010 following allegations his wife Iris, then an MP, had obtained Â£50,000 for her 19-year-old lover. 
	He lost his seat in the General Election but returned to Stormont, where he shares power with Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness of Sinn Fein."

	""An audio file of Alan pleading for his life has just been received by me. I and people representing me continue to reach out to those holding Alan. 
	""Islamic State continue to ignore our pleas to open dialogue."" 
	Mr Henning travelled to Syria in December last year as part of a convoy delivering humanitarian aid to Syrian citizens. 
	He had volunteered to drive an ambulance full of medical supplies as part of the charity trip, which was organised by the Bolton and the UK Arab Society. 
	The group planned to transport life-saving medical equipment to a hospital in Idlib, northwestern Syria. 
	It is believed Mr Henning was abducted by IS in al Dana, a town 24 miles from Aleppo, shortly after arriving in the country. 
	Mrs Henning said her husband went to Syria to help the country's ""most vulnerable"" people by delivering ""much-needed aid"". 
	""We are at a loss (as to) why those leading Islamic State cannot open their hearts and minds to the facts surrounding Alan's imprisonment and why they continue to threaten his life,"" she said. 
	""I have been told that he has been to a Sharia Court and found innocent of being a spy and declared to be no threat. 
	""I implore Islamic State to abide by the decisions of their own justice system. Please release Alan."" 
	Prime Minister David Cameron is in talks over Britain's role in the battle against Islamic State fighters. 
	Mr Cameron was consulted before the US and Arab Allies launched strikes against the terrorist group in Syria overnight. 
	Downing Street said Mr Cameron would spend the next 48 hours at the United Nations discussing ""what more the UK and others can do to contribute to international efforts to tackle the threat we face from ISIL"". 
	The PM is expected to recall MPs, who are on recess for the party conference season, as soon as Friday to consult on the issue of Britain joining the US airstrikes. 
	Speaking after the US and five Arab nations launched their strikes in Syria, President Barack Obama repeated his vow to build an international coalition to defeat IS. 
	He said defeating IS would take time and effort, but added: ""We're going to do what's necessary to take the fight to this terrorist group."""

	Jacques Borel, the man behind the campaign, has managed to get VAT cuts in a number of European countries, including France, Germany, Belgium and Finland. 
	""Our message is clear - a reduction in the level of VAT on a long-term basis will generate growth and create jobs in the important leisure and hospitality sector,"" he said. 
	""At present all food and drink in pubs is subject to 20% VAT, compared to supermarkets which benefit from a zero VAT rate.""

	The move marks a step up in the hunt for ""person of interest"" Jesse Matthew, who officers say was the last person to see UK-born Hannah Graham. 
	The 18-year-old, whose parents are British, went missing in Charlottesville, Virginia, in the early hours of September 13 after a night out with friends. 
	The warrant seeks the arrest of Matthew, 32, on suspicion of abduction with the intent to defile, Charlottesville Police Chief Tim Longo told a news conference on Tuesday evening. 
	He said officers were ""absolutely"" still searching for Miss Graham, who was seen entering a bar with Matthew at about 1am on September 13. 
	They had drinks before leaving after about 15 minutes, driving away in his orange Chrysler coupe, according to police. 
	Matthew, 32, spoke to a lawyer for about an hour when he turned up at Charlottesville police station at the weekend, but did not speak to investigators - and then drove off. 
	Officers pursuing him said they had to stop the chase for the safety of the public, and an arrest warrant for reckless driving was issued. 
	Charlottesville officers executed a search warrant on his apartment on Monday, but have not released the results. It was the second time police had searched the property. 
	Ms Graham's disappearance has shaken the college town, about 100 miles southwest of Washington DC. 
	More than 1,200 people have been looking for the teenager and fellow students have been holding vigils for their missing classmate.

	Mr Longo encouraged the public to circulate the wanted poster for Matthew across the East Coast and throughout the United States. 
	He said it was felt there was ""sufficient probable cause"" to seek an arrest warrant. 
	""We absolutely are continuing our search for Hannah even as we speak and we will continue our search for Hannah, and thank you so much for reminding me to stress that point, because it is a very important one,"" he said. 
	Ms Graham is one of at least five females to go missing along the Route 29 corridor since 1996. 
	In 2009, Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington was abducted and murdered - a case that remains unsolved."

	The publisher of titles including the Daily Mirror and Sunday People admitted liability to four people but did not identify them. 
	The individuals are Eastenders star Shane Richie, who plays Alfie Moon, and Lucy Benjamin who left the soap in 2010 as well as fellow actor Shobna GulatiÂ and the BBC's creative director Alan Yentob. 
	Those who have already received undisclosed payments are former England football managerÂ Sven-Goran Eriksson, actor Christopher Eccleston and David and VictoriaÂ Beckham's former nanny,Â Abbie Gibson.

	The ex-Top Of The Pops presenter was cleared of another count of indecent assault, and the jury was undecided on a count of sexual assault. 
	The 69-year-old DJÂ stared straight ahead with a stony expression as the verdicts were read out atÂ London's Southwark Crown Court. 
	Judge Anthony Leonard QC warned him he was looking at ""all options"" for sentencing. 
	Travis, from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, was convicted of groping a woman working on the Mrs Merton Show on January 17, 1995. 
	Prosecutors claimed he approached her as she stood smoking in the corridor and put his hands on her chest for at least 10-15 seconds until she ran away. 
	She spoke to police about the allegation following Travis' first indecent assault trial earlier this year. 
	Prosecutor Teresa Hay said the Crown would not be seeking a retrial on the count of sexual assault which the jury was hung on, and a formal verdict of not guilty was entered. 
	The jury forewomanÂ said they had found Travis guilty of indecent assault by a majority of 10-2. 
	They returned their verdicts after 19 hours and 15 minutes of deliberations. 
	During the trial, prosecutors claimed Travis was an ""opportunist"" who acted as if he had the ""perfect right"" to grope young women. 
	Travis, who appeared in court under his real name David Griffin, faced a retrial after jurors failed to reach verdicts on two of the charges in February. 
	He was first arrested in 2012 under Operation Yewtree, Scotland Yard's investigation into historical sexual abuse in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. 
	The allegations against him dated back to the 1990s when he was starring in panto, while the most recent was said to have happened during an interview with a journalist at his home in 2008. 
	Jenny Hopkins, Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor for the CPS, said: ""David Griffin, also known as Dave Lee Travis, indecently assaulted a young woman by touching her in a way that was not only deeply invasive but also against the law. 
	""We thank the jury for their careful consideration in this case and we respect all the verdicts of the court today. 
	""The prosecution of sexual offences is often difficult and complex, perhaps even more so when the allegations are from some years ago. 
	""We will continue to consider cases and, wherever there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest, we will work with police to build strong cases which can be put before the court."""

	The five-year-old's parents prompted a police hunt across Europe in August when they took him from hospital in Southampton without doctors' consent. 
	His parents, Brett and Naghemeh King, were detained as Portsmouth City Council launched legal action against them. 
	But the High Court later ruled he could be taken to the Czech Republic and he has since been undergoing treatment at Prague's Proton Therapy Centre (PTC) as part of his recovery from surgery on a brain tumour. 
	And a statement issued by NHS England said: ""Our thoughts are with Ashya and his family as he begins follow-on radiotherapy. 
	""Now that Ashya is in Prague, it is clearly best that Ashya continues to be treated uninterrupted so the NHS has agreed to fund this care, as requested by his parents, in accordance with relevant European cross-border arrangements. 
	""We all join in wishing him well, and greatly hope he makes a full and successful recovery."" 
	Sources told Sky News they would continue to judge treatment on a case-by-case basis and that Ashya'sÂ case did not set a precedent for other patients. 
	The PTC, in a statement on its website, outlined the difference between proton beam therapy and conventional radiotherapy. 
	It said: ""Proton therapy can be much better modulated and precisely focused into the tumour volume. In case of irradiation ofÂ medulloblastoma in Ashya, it is necessary to apply the highest possible dose into the former location but protect the tissue around as much as possible. 
	""In Ashya's case, those are vital structures of the heart, lung, liver and intestines."" 
	Proton therapy would decrease the dose to other parts of the body, including the heart, liver and intestines and trachea by up to 80%, the PTC said. 
	""This means decreasing the risk of developing cardiovascular disorders, breathing disorders or metabolic disorders on the first place and better protection of the swallowing functions and normal food intake,"" the statement added."

	He was one of 11 men held as part of a police investigation into alleged support of extremist group Al Muhajiroun. 
	The 47-year-old, who is to answer bail in January, tweeted: ""I've been released from police custody. 
	""Just in time for Cameron to declare war on Islam & Muslims in Iraq & Syria."" 
	He was among nine men, aged between 22 and 51, held in London on suspicion of being members of a terror organisation and encouraging terrorism. 
	Two more were stopped and detained near junction 1 of the M6, just outside Rugby, Warwickshire. 
	One of the arrested men - 39-year-old Trevor Brookes - has been charged with two counts of breaching his notification requirement, while seven others have been bailed. 
	The pair held on M6 remained in custody. 
	A number of properties - 11 in east London, one in west London, one in northwest London, five in south London and one in Stoke-on-Trent - were searched as part of the investigation. 
	One of them was Yummy Yummy, a sweet shop in Whitechapel, East London, owned by Mr Choudary's brother Yadzani. 
	Mr ChoudaryÂ said after his release: ""My arrest certainly was politically motivated. 
	""The last time the government proscribed any organisation linked to me or previous groups I have been linked to was in June 2014. 
	""They have done nothing since then. They waited until the day before a major vote on a war against Muslims for a high-profile series of arrests."" 
	Mr Choudary said he was questioned at Southwark police station about being a member of up to 10 banned groups including Islam4UK and Need4Khalifah. 
	He was reported to have said this week he had no sympathy for aid worker Alan Henning, who has been captured by the Islamic State in Syria. 
	He reportedly said: ""In the Koran it is not allowed for you to feel sorry for non Muslims. I don't feel sorry for him.""

2014-09-26,DLT Sentenced For Groping TV Personality,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140926190931/http://news.sky.com/story/1342579/dlt-sentenced-for-groping-tv-personality,"Disgraced DJ Dave Lee Travis has left court after being given a three-month suspended sentence for indecently assaulting a TV personality. 
	Speaking to reporters outside, the former Radio 1 star said he was ""mortified"" and ""really disappointed"" over his conviction this week and criticised his prosecution. 
	He said the judge accepted that prosecutors had failed to prove their case that he was a ""sexual predator"". 
	Travis said: ""I was worried if the prosecution threw enough mud at me, some of it might stick"", adding it was ""of little comfort that I was acquitted of so many others (alleged offences)"". 
	He said of those people closest to him: ""We all know the truth and I'm grateful for that."" 
	Travis, who became a household name in the 1970s, was found guilty on Tuesday of indecently assaulting a woman in 1995. 
	He was sentenced to three months in prison, suspended for two years. 
	The incident took place behind the scenes at The Mrs Merton Show, a programme which the victim had been working on as a researcher. 
	The DJ had squeezed her breasts for 10-15 seconds after cornering her in a corridor of a BBC studio. 
	The victim had been smoking in the corridor when he commented on her ""poor little lungs"" before groping her. 
	Sentencing the 69-year-old man at London's Southwark Crown Court, Judge Leonard said: ""It was an intentional and unpleasant sexual assault. 
	""You took advantage of a young woman in a vulnerable position whose job it was to look after you that day."" 
	In the dock, Travis briefly looked down and then said: ""Thank you, your honour"". 
	Marianne, his wife of more than 40 years, hugged a friend in the public gallery after the judge delivered his sentence. 
	In a statement read out ahead of his sentencing, the victim said: ""I was subjected to an unprovoked and terrifying physical assault at my place of work. 
	""I was too paralysed with fear to confront my assailant."" 
	Before sentencing, journalist Camilla Long said Travis had ""bashed"" on the dock glass and ""screamed"" at her to move from the seats behind him in the public gallery to the press seats, as she was making him ""uncomfortable"". 
	Ms Long, who in 2012 wrote an article in which she claimed Travis had groped her during an interview, told Sky News the incident in court on Friday was ""incredibly intimidating"". 
	This week, Travis was found not guilty on a second indecent assault charge and the jury was discharged after it was unable to agree a verdict on a count of sexual assault. 
	He faced a retrial after jurors failed to reach verdicts on those two charges earlier this year. 
	He was cleared of 12 counts of indecent assault at his original trial in February. 
	The broadcaster, of Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, was first arrested in October 2012 under Operation Yewtree, Scotland Yard's investigation into historic sexual abuse in the wake of allegations against the late DJ Jimmy Savile. 
	Judge Leonard said Travis' offence was of a ""different order of magnitude"" to other more serious convictions under Operation Yewtree."
2014-09-26,UK Airstrikes Could Begin In Hours After Yes Vote,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140926190931/http://news.sky.com/story/1342811/mps-vote-yes-to-airstrikes-against-islamic-state,"MPs have overwhelmingly backed airstrikes against Islamic State fighters in Iraq - meaning RAF bombing raids could take place in hours. 
	Parliament gave approval by 524 votes to 43 (a massive majority of 481) for Britain to join the US-led coalition in the Middle East after the Prime Minister said IS forces are ""psychopathic terrorists trying to kill us"". 
Labour MP Rushanara Ali immediately resigned from the party's front bench after the result was announced. 
	Labour leader Ed Miliband told her afterwards: ""I know that you have thought long and hard about this. I respect and accept your resignation."" 
	Ian McKenzie, the Labour MP for Inverclyde, was sacked as a parliamentary aide to Shadow Defence Secretary Vernon Coaker for voting against military action. 
	Britain has six Tornado GR4 fighter bombers in Cyprus ready to strike northern Iraq, a figure which Cabinet minister Kenneth Clarke said would make the UK's military contribution ""almost symbolic"". 
	The planes, which have been in RAF Akrotiri for the past six weeks carrying out surveillance missions in the Middle East, could begin airstrikes in the early hours of Saturday morning. 
	Defence Minister Michael Fallon told Sky News: ""You're not going to see immediate military action - a wave of shock and awe or anything like that ... not tonight no, absolutely not. 
	""We have to select our targets in accordance with the American and international effort that's going on in Iraq. 
	""There's fighting around these towns - we have to fit in to the day-to-day fighting and see where we can help best."" 
	It came as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said US-led airstrikesÂ had already worsened a dire humanitarian crisis in Iraq and Syria. 
	David Cameron told the Commons debate that Islamist militants ""have already murdered one British hostage"" and are ""threatening the lives of two more"". 
	He described IS, which has invaded large areas of Syria and Iraq, as ""a terrorist organisation unlike those we have dealt with before"". 
	He said: ""The brutality is staggering - beheadings, crucifixions, the gouging out of eyes, the use of rape as a weapon, the slaughter of children. All of these things belong to the dark ages."" 
	During the six-and-a-half-hourÂ debate, MrÂ Miliband said he understood the deep unease about taking military action, but said the UK could not stand by in the face of the threat from IS, also known as ISIL. 
	""ISIL is not simply a murderous organisation; it has ambitions for a state of its own - a caliphate across the Middle East, run according to their horrific norms and values,"" he said. 
	But in a typically firebrand intervention, outspoken Respect MP George Galloway said bombing would not work, and stressed the need to strengthen ground forces in the region. 
	He said: ""ISIL is a death cult, it's a gang of terrorist murderers. It's not an army and it's certainly not an army that's going to be destroyed by aerial bombardment."" 
	The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, backed UK airstrikes, telling the House of Lords: ""The action proposed today is right."" 
	But he warned ""we must not rely on a short-term solution"" and a wider effort was needed to turn extremists away from the ""evil of ISIL"". 
	On Thursday, the Cabinet unanimously backed military action against IS, which could last up to three years. 
	The PM was desperate to avoid the embarrassment of the Commons defeat on Syria airstrikes last year, and tabled a cautiously-worded motion intended to win support from all parties for action in Iraq."
2014-09-26,How Much Will Airstrikes On IS Cost Taxpayer?,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140926190931/http://news.sky.com/story/1342768/how-much-will-airstrikes-on-is-cost-taxpayer,"Calculating the anticipated cost of Britain's contribution to the anti-IS coalition is imprecise at best. 
	According to a Ministry of Defence report to Parliament in 2010, each Tornado flight costs Â£35,000 per hour. 
	Typically, two Tornados fly each mission, lasting anywhere between four and eight hours. 
	So let's land somewhere in the middle: a six-hour mission costs a basic Â£210,000. 
	Then we have to consider the cost of the missiles. 
	The expected payload would be four Paveway bombs, Â£22,000 each, and two Brimstone missiles, Â£105,000 per unit. 
	So let's say that's Â£508,000 per aircraft in total, just a smidgen over Â£1m per mission. 
	If they carry Storm Shadows at Â£800,000 a pop, then the cost rises considerably. 
	But then of course we should bear in mind that each aircraft might not drop its full load, so the figures distort further still. 
	And the Tornados need to refuel en route. Although operating costs for the Voyager aircraft aren't available, it is considerably more efficient than its VC-10 Tristar predecessor. 
	The TLAMs, Tomahawk Cruise Missiles, carried on the Astute class submarines, are the most expensive item - Â£950,000 a pop. It's unlikely many, if any, of these will be fired. 
	As I said, although the individual figures are accurate, the calculations are almost impossible to make, so dependent are they on mission-specific variants. 
	Please treat my sums with the dose of cynicism they deserve, they are merely a crude, early examination of what Britain's involvement in Iraq might cost the taxpayer. 
	The true cost will be made available at a much later date by the MoD and National Audit Office. 
	One other thing I'd like to mention: it is very possible that the very RAF GR4 Tornado fast jets that take off on the first bombing missions over Iraq won't be in service by the time the mission is complete, whenever that might be. 
	Only three Tornado squadrons remain, next year another will disband leaving just two. They are the British military's only true ground attack aircraft, to be replaced, sometime in the next decade, by the new F35 Joint Strike Fighter. 
	The F-35 is a fantastic aircraft, but it is overdue, over budget and faith in it being delivered by 2020 is diminishing. 
	Perhaps this mission will reward the Tornado squadrons with a small extension to the life in service - and what a busy, prestigious life it has been for that aircraft."
2014-09-26,Missing Alice: 150 Calls After Reconstruction,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140926190931/http://news.sky.com/story/1342618/missing-alice-150-calls-after-reconstruction,"A reconstruction of Alice Gross' last-known steps before her disappearance has led to 150 calls with information, police say. 
	The fresh leads come after an ""area of interest"" in a west London park brought no clues to the whereabouts of the missing 14-year-old. 
	Parts of Elthorne Park near her home in Hanwell had been cordoned off overnight by investigators who were scouring through disturbed earth which runs beside the canal towpath where Alice was last seen. 
	""A full assessment has now been carried out, which has determined this area is not of relevance to the investigation into Alice's disappearance,"" a Scotland Yard spokesman said. 
	A white tent had been erected at the scene, and officers in diving gear had been searching a boggy area next to the river. 
	On Thursday, police staged a reconstruction which showed the high school student ""power walking"" on a towpath alongside the Grand Union Canal. 
	CCTV cameras overlooking the path captured her movements at 4.26pm on 28 August. She has not been seen since. 
	Arnis Zalkalns, a convicted murder who is being treated as the prime suspect, cycled along the same towpath 15 minutes later. 
	Alice's mother, Rosalind Hodgkiss, has said: ""Every morning, as Alice's disappearance grows longer and longer, brings new agony, new anguish."""
2014-09-26,"UKIP Tanks On Labour's Lawn, Says Farage",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140926190931/http://news.sky.com/story/1342706/ukip-tanks-on-labours-lawn-says-farage,"Nigel Farage has told supporters UKIP is parking its ""tanks on the Labour Party's lawn"" as he launched an assault on its heartlands. 
	Speaking at the party's conference in Doncaster - the town Labour leader Ed Miliband represents - Mr Farage said UKIP was ""tearing vast chunks"" out of the Labour vote. 
	In a move to court the 'blue collar' vote, UKIP outlined plans to ease the burden on low-paid workers. 
	Mr Farage said the party was eating into Labour support in the Midlands, the North and across Wales. 
	""This party is not about left and right. This party is about right and wrong,"" he told a cheering audience of 2,000 delegates. 
	""We want to signal to everyone we are now parking our tanks on the Labour Party's lawn."" 
	Many target seats for UKIP are Labour-held, said Mr Farage, and claimed polling showed his party was a threat ""not just to the Conservative Party, as the papers would have you believe, we pose a threat to the entire British political class and I'll drink to that"". 
	People at the ballot box had ignored the establishment and voted for change, he argued. 
	And Mr Farage joked about nearly forgetting the deficit - in reference to Mr Miliband's recent conference faux pas - as he said leaving the EU would save Â£10bn a year. 
	On the traditional ground of immigration, Mr Farage said: ""You cannot control your own borders and be a member of the European Union. It is not possible. 
	""We must take back control of our borders and manage our own immigration policy."" 
	Mr Farage said the biggest boost given to UKIP had been given by the TV debates with Nick Clegg ahead of the European elections, which Mr Farage is widely acknowledged to have won. 
	In recognition of this, he mocked the Lib Dem leader by leading a round of applause for him in the conference hall. 
	And he took a sideswipe at Labour over the NHS. 
	""So let's fight the Labour Party back on the National Health Service, they've done more than anybody to actually bring private money into the health service and it's not UKIP that will do it,"" he said. 
	Calling on the UKIP ""people's army"" to go out and fight for support, he said he was ""bored and sick to death"" with hearing supporting UKIP split the vote. 
	""The message that needs to come out from this conference is that actually, in our target seats next year, in the by-elections and in the general election, if you vote UKIP you will get UKIP. 
	""If we get this right, and if we win enough seats in that parliament in what is going to be a tight general election we could even say to people 'vote UKIP to hold the balance of power'. 
	""And if we hold the balance of power there won't just be a referendum on our EU membership there will be a culture change in British politics. It will be a kind of politics that represents ordinary men and women in this country. 
	""It will be politics of change, it will be a politics that is better than the one we have today. 
	""So I'm going to say to people from this conference let's go out there, let's fight in our people's army hard on the ground. A tremendous potential prize awaits us."""

	Grandfather Mohammad Asghar, 70, was one of two people shot - the other man died - by a guard at Adiala jail in Rawalpindi on Thursday morning. 
	The 70-year-old, from Edinburgh, was sentenced to death in January on blasphemy charges after writing letters to a number of people claiming to be the Prophet Mohammed. 
	His family say he has been diagnosed as mentally ill with severe paranoid schizophrenia but that the illness was not taken into account at the trial. 
	Daughter Jasmine Rana, 40, said: ""This is our worst nightmare come true. Ever since news of his sentence reached us in January of this year, we have spent every day fearing for his safety. 
	""The UK and Scottish Governments assured our family that steps were being taken to keep our dad safe in prison. Obviously that hasn't happened. Our father turned out to be at risk from the very people responsible for his safety. 
	""We are begging David Cameron and the whole of the British Government to do everything they can to ensure that as soon as he is well enough to travel our father is brought back to the UK where he will be safe. 
	""Until then we want him to be kept in a hospital where he will be properly protected and treated."" 
	She talked of her father as ""the sweetest and nicest person you will ever meet"", saying how he arrived in the UK at 16 and went on to be a successful businessman. 
	He opened a school in Lahore, Pakistan, and an orphanage in Rawalpindi and it was in Rawalpindi in 2010 that he was arrested after a blasphemy complaint was brought against him by a tenant with whom he was having a dispute. 
	Mr Asghar's son, Tony Asghar, 41, said he has not seen his father for five years as he has been warned it would not be safe for him to travel to Pakistan. 
	He said: ""It's killing me that I've not seen my father for five years. It is a nightmare, an absolute nightmare. 
	""We just want him back."" 
	A Foreign Office spokesman said yesterday: ""We have raised our concerns with the local authorities at a senior level."""

	The Boeing 787 was flying from Chicago to WarsawÂ with 248 people on board when the captain requested the emergency landing. 
	LOT spokeswoman Barbara Pijanowsk-Kuras said the emergency landing was required according to safety procedures after the crew received a warning from the firefighting system. 
	News reports said the pilot had reported a smell of smoke in the cabin. 
	The plane, which landed safely at 11.35am, was met by airport emergency services and checked by firefighters. It was deemed safe before it taxied to a stand. 
	The passengers have since disembarked, while the aircraft is ""under technical review"", a statement by the airline said.Â  
	The airport remains open, and LOT said it was considering using another aircraft to bring the passengers to Warsaw. 
	The 787 has been plagued by problems. 
	Last year, the model was grounded around the world for three months while the battery systems were checked after a few of the aircraft developed problems that led to the appearance of smoke. 
	The battery appeared to overheat,Â reaching temperatures capable of melting rock. 
	Boeing redesigned the battery, charger and containment system to ensure battery fires would not put the aircraft at risk. Since then, the aircraft have experienced a series of minor glitches, including a fault with an air pressure sensor and the brake system. 
	Boeing insists the Dreamliner is operating safely."
2014-09-26,10 Things UKIP Must Do To Boost Credibility,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140926190931/http://news.sky.com/story/1342372/10-things-ukip-must-do-to-boost-credibility,"With just eight months to go until the election, UKIP needs to prove it can be a credible election force. 
	Thanks to a parliamentary vote on air strikes in Iraq, international events threaten to overshadow their conference. 
	Nevertheless, it's a big opportunity for Nigel Farage's party to reach out to voters and cause a big head ache for his political opponents. 
	Here's a 10-point plan for what they need to do. 
	1. Show the party is more than just a one man band. UKIP needs to be more than just the Nigel Farage Show. 
	2. Come up with a credible, easy to digest policy on the economy and the deficit. 
	3. Tap into people's fears about immigration - without appearing racist. 
	4. Reach out to voters in the north. UKIP have claimed for a while that they are about more than disgruntled Tories and can pinch Labour's votes too. Now is their chance to prove it. 
	5. Get more defections. Douglas Carswell was a major coup for UKIP. More would be welcome. 
	6. Especially if they are Labour defections. 
	7. Lay the ground work in Clacton. The main parties have managed to try and write off UKIP because they don't have any MPs. If they win the Clacton by-election, that would change. 
	8. Deliver a stonking leader's speech. Ed Miliband is widely considered to have underperformed. If Nigel Farage impresses it will really concern David Cameron. 
	9. Avoid being overshadowed by international events such as air strikes in Iraq.* 
	10. The most important thing UKIP needs to do? Avoid slip-ups. If that sounds easy - remember it's UKIP we're talking about. 
	* Admittedly, this is impossible. But they can at least try."
2014-09-26,Iraq Airstrikes Could Happen Within Hours,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140926190931/http://news.sky.com/story/1341979/airstrikes-could-happen-minutes-after-vote,"In theory, British airstrikes on Iraq could have started within minutes of parliamentary approval. 
	Realistically, RAF Tornados will be in the skies in the very early hours of Saturday morning, at the earliest. 
	They will deploy in pairs, taking off over Akrotiri Bay and climbing northeast over the Mediterranean and towards the Turkish coast. 
	The butterflies of anticipation will be churning away inside, they will be aware of the television cameras at the end of the runway, they will know that within a few hours, as dawn breaks, they will be headline news. 
	Hugging the Turkish border with Syria at 25,000 feet, the jets will meet an RAF Voyager refuelling aircraft en route, before dropping down into northern Iraq. 
	Flying at 400mph (643kph), they will reach the theatre of operations within a short time. 
	What happens next is a decision for US Centcom, which is co-ordinating the overall operation. 
	The jets might fit into a holding pattern to perform an ""x-cas"" role, the military acronym for ""emergency close air support"". 
	Because this isn't a traditional conflict against a rogue state, there will be fewer major installations to destroy. 
	The coalition wants to destroy Islamic State, they don't want to destroy Iraq. 
	The Tornados, one of the best ground-attack aircraft in the world, will be fully loaded with the equipment specific to the task they've been given. 
	A Litening III pod will be attached underneath. This gives the crew the ability to examine the immediate area and then laser-designate the target. 
	The final decision to fire will be down to the pilot himself. 
	The payload will probably be four Paveway bombs and two Brimstone missiles. 
	Paveways can be programmed by the crew to explode just before it hits the target, or on impact or with a small delay so it can bury into a building. 
	The Brimstone locks on to its target the moment it is fired. It is a ""fire-and-forget"" weapon, meaning that it can be used in all weathers and at distance from the target. 
	Designed especially for armoured vehicles or similar, a small warhead explodes first to soften up the armour before a larger warhead detonates creating more destruction. 
	For the British, this will be a twin-pronged operation: from sea and air. A Royal Naval submarine is also moving into position. 
	Her exact identity and location is top secret but she's most likely in the eastern Mediterranean. 
	She carries Tomahawk cruise missiles - TLAMs - which have a range of about 1,000 miles (1,600km). 
	Guided by GPS, these are effective against static objects: buildings, military installations, weapons dumps and oil refineries. 
	The submarine can also watch live images from a camera on the TLAM as it flies over the battlefield and strikes its target. 
	Job done, the crew will turn for home. Landing back in Cyprus, the news will just be breaking. 
	Within hours, footage recorded on board the aircraft will be released to the media to be broadcast and analysed on 24-hour news channels around the world. 
	As the crews eat some food and get some sleep, another team will be getting ready for their mission, ready to fly at a moment's notice."
2014-09-26,UK To Strike Iraq - But Is Syria The Real Target?,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140926190931/http://news.sky.com/story/1341770/uk-to-strike-iraq-but-is-syria-the-real-target,"This week in New York has given David Cameron what he's needed. A platform and a justification to bring British airpower to the fight against the Islamic State. 
	There was palpable relief in the delegation travelling with the Prime Minister when I interviewed him earlier. Britain can now play a more aggressive role in the coalition its special relationship partner is building. 
	And the Prime Minister seems confident he will not suffer another embarrassing debacle in parliament. Ed Miliband has much to lose if he opposes him. But there is an inconsistency in Britain's role and clear limits on its intervention. 
	In his speech to the UN General Assembly David Cameron spoke of specific atrocities IS has carried out in Syria, the slaughter of 700 tribesmen for instance in the east of the country, and he talked of the dangers of inaction. 
	But Britain will not be striking IS in Syria. It will only target the organisation in Iraq. What remains to be hit there and remains exposed for further airstrikes is not clear.Â  
	IS strongholds are in Syria and any effort to destroy it, the clear endgame for both the US and UK, will require attacking it there. 
	The Prime Minister is not confident about either the legality of airstrikes in Syria or the chances of persuading MPs to support the idea. 
	So if the Prime Minister is able to win support for intervention on Friday, which seems likely, Britain joins the air campaign late and in a limited role. 
	Any expansion of that across the border into Syria will need another debate in parliament. The Prime Minister's adamant about that."
2014-09-26,What Now For Abu Qatada After Aquittal?,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140926190931/http://news.sky.com/story/1341570/what-now-for-abu-qatada-after-aquittal,"By Tom Rayner, Middle East Reporter, in Amman, Jordan Only a man sure he was on the verge of freedom would smile walking into a cage, flanked by armed police in a high-security court. 
	Abu Qatada exuded confidence from behind the bars of the dock. 
	It took only a few minutes for the judge to read out the verdict. 
	He said there was simply not enough evidence for a conviction on involvement in a plan to attack Israeli and western tourists during millennium celebrations. 
	Having been cleared in June of another charge related to alleged bomb plot in 1998, the man once dubbed ""Bin Laden's right-hand man in Europe"" was cleared of all the accusations he had been convicted of in absentia 14 years ago. 
	The Home Office was quick to say that Abu Qatada would not be able to return to Britain, regardless of the verdict, but it's not entirely clear that he would want to, even if he was able to. 
	Qatada's battle against extradition was always grounded on the claim that he would not receive a fair trial in Jordan. 
	His lawyers insisted the testimonies that formed the evidence against him were obtained under torture. 
	The agreement that no such testimonies would be used in his retrial was key to his deportation last year. 
	Now the trial has taken place and his acquittal secured, there are many reasons why Abu Qatada may be content to stay in Jordan. 
	Key among them is the rise of Islamic State - a crisis that Abu Qatada may feel he can influence most effectively from the region. 
	As he left court, journalists mobbed him. 
	Desperate to get his response not just to his acquittal, but to get his view on the airstrikes against IS â the group whose behaviour he has already denounced as counter to Islam. 
	It's clear, perhaps because of his notoriety, Abu Qatada remains one of the world's most influential jihadist thinkers. 
	""I don't think Abu Qatada is involved in terrorist organisations, otherwise he'd have been found guilty,"" said his friend, Jordanian analyst of jihadi movements, Marwan Shehadeh. 
	""But he's one of the main mentors for jihadist groups â and he's a Sheikh, a scholar of sharia law, and so he gives fatwas in relation to jihad."" 
	Shehadeh believes the rise of Islamic State has divided global jihadist thinking, and added: ""There are two wings â one is represented by (Jordanian jihadist Abu Musab al)Â Zarqawi, which is now Islamic State, the other is the views of Bin Laden, which is al Qaeda. 
	""I think Abu Qatada is more supportive of al Qaeda than IS. He judges the actions by looking to sharia law, and makes fatwas based on that."" 
	But Shehadeh also warned regional governments not to count on Qatada's condemnation of Islamic State, neutering the potential for a backlash in their own countries. 
	He said: ""Of course he is against the alliance â the campaign to target IS, al Nusra and other factions ... I think soon he will release statement against the alliance and the airstrikes."" 
	Many are already watching how Abu Qatada uses his new freedom."

	Michael Stockman, 31, of Coleraine, Co Londonderry, was convicted of 12 counts of theft and ordered to pay Â£1,200 in compensation. 
	District Judge Liam McNally said: ""You have lied in relation to the reasons that the contracts were cancelled and you have not paid back one penny. 
	""Had you acknowledged your guilt and shown some remorse I would have suspended the sentence."" 
	Coleraine Magistrates Court heard how, during 2012 and 2013, Stockman made 11th-hour cancellations for weddings, birthday and leaving parties booked through his company North West Discos. 
	His charges had ranged from Â£40 for a birthday party to Â£300 received in two instalments for a wedding. 
	District Judge McNally said: ""You allowed people to enter into contracts for a DJ service for important events in their lives such as weddings. 
	""Either the night before or that night they were cancelled with an entirely untruthful excuse causing a great deal of trauma to those people who had paid you for the service."" 
	Stockman used the death of his father as an excuse on three occasions and, on six further occasions, said the DJ he had subcontracted the party to had been injured in a car crash. 
	He claimed to have signed his business over to someone else in 2012 but the judge dismissed the excuse as a ""ruse"". 
	Speaking in his defence, a tattooed Stockman told the court his life had taken a disastrous turn after he was attacked in May of that year. 
	Stockman said: ""I had my nose bitten off my face in an unprovoked attack. I had 13 stitches. Ever since that day my life has been upside down."" 
	He later added: ""At that time my head was all over the place not only with mental issues. That first years was like a blank canvass I could not believe half the things that have even happened here."" 
	After the sentencing, Moira Todd, from the Trading Standards Service, said: ""His actions were cruel and had the potential to ruin what should be the best day of people's lives. 
	""He made no apology to anyone and totally ignored requests for refunds."" 
	Stockman plans to appeal."
2014-09-26,Child In Newcastle Pond Tragedy Named,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140926190931/http://news.sky.com/story/1342547/child-in-newcastle-pond-tragedy-named,"A three-year-old boy who died after falling into a pond in Newcastle has been named as Callum Greenwood. 
	The little boy was found 10 minutes after he was reported missing on Thursday evening but was later pronounced dead at the Royal Victoria Infirmary. 
	A neighbour who saw emergency services' frantic efforts to save Callum said he realised at once something terrible had happened. 
	Plasterer Paul Taylor, 37, who lives next door, said: ""I'd been out to get an Indian and when I came back there was a massive police search on. 
	""They had closed off the road and the ambulance was there. 
	""I saw somebody in a blanket being carried into the ambulance. 
	""I thought obviously something terrible had happened but I didn't know what."" 
	He added: ""It's hard to believe this has happened to someone of that age."" 
	His partner, Emma Taylor, 38, said: ""We could see people crying and screaming. A woman was hysterical. 
	""When we saw someone being bundled into the ambulance, we still didn't know. 
	""The people next door are very private. We have since heard the boy was their daughter's child, who had come for a visit."" 
	Two Police Community Support Officers were seen standing outside the large detached property in Elswick Road where the little boy was last seen. 
	Northumbria Police's Superintendent Mick Paterson said on Thursday night: ""This is an incredibly tragic incident and our thoughts are with the family at this difficult time. 
	""They are understandably absolutely devastated and officers with specialist training are providing them with support."" 
	A report is being prepared for the coroner."
2014-09-26,Fathers Of Iraq War Dead Split Over Raids,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140926190931/http://news.sky.com/story/1342303/fathers-of-iraq-war-dead-split-over-raids,"By David Bowden, Senior Correspondent Few are better equipped to have an opinion on the wisdom or otherwise of sending British troops into action again in Iraq, than John Miller and John Hyde. 
	Both lost a son during the last Iraq war. 
	Both live with the consequences every day, trying to find answers, trying to stay strong for their families and particularly their wives, Marilyn and Sandra, who struggle, even now with losing their boys. 
	Corporal Simon Miller, 21, and Lance Corporal Ben Hyde, 23, were two of the six Red Caps, Royal Military Police, brutally killed by an angry mob in Majar al Kabir in southern Iraq on 24 June 2003. 
	Despite sharing such devastating losses in the fight to topple Saddam HusseinÂ more than a decade ago, the two Johns have opposing views today on whether UK forces should intervene once again in the fate of Iraq. 
	Sitting in his spotless kitchen in Washington, Tyne and Wear, watched over by a poster-sized photograph of his fallen son, John Miller told me RAFÂ airstrikesÂ would only ""fuel the fire"" of extremists planning terrorist atrocities. 
	He says the UK and America should leave Arab states to take the lead on military intervention. 
	""We look at how the Arab world sees the Western world, particularly Britain and America, over what happened in Iraq and it's only fuelling the fire. It's a recruiting programme. 
	""The securest thing for our countries would be not to be involved and it will not give them any reason to want to commit a terrorist attack in our country."" 
	Mr Miller believes we have already opened what he calls ""Pandora's box"" in the Middle East and we will never be able to close it again. 
	He fears his son Simon and all those other British soldiers who have given their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan may have died in vain. 
	Islamic State and their brothers in arms, he says, are the consequence of the West's folly and further involvement will bring further UK casualties. 
	""I for one do not want to see another coffin draped in the Union Jack coming back to BrizeÂ Norton (RAFÂ Airforce base), somebody else's family ruined for the rest of their lives for something we can't and never will be able to solve."" 
	An hour down the road in Northallerton, North Yorkshire, John Hyde is more measured in his assessment of the prospect of UK airstrikes. 
	He speaks quietly because his wife Sandra has already gone to bed. It's only 8.30pm , but she finds any media discussion of Ben too harrowing to face. 
	He is in favour of any assistance the UK can offer in Iraq with the exception of ""boots on the ground"". 
	""Anything short of that we should give,"" he says. 
	""Training troops, advice, air support, anything we can give, because in the end the outcome must be positive. 
	""It's an international problem and I think it is something the international community should solve."" 
	MrÂ Hyde channels much of his energy into running a memorial trust in honour of Ben, which has so far raised more than Â£100,000. 
	He often doesn't go to bed until 4am because he's working on his computer. 
	The screensaver - a picture of his dead son in his dress uniform. 
	There is no shortage of other memorabilia too; a sequence of pictures of Ben as a young boy, a commemorative certificate signed by the Queen and even a small wooden box with a brass plaque containing Ben's DNA, which had been held by the Ministry of Defence. 
	The Millers' home also proudly displays mementos of their son, Simon, who died for Queen and Country and who fills their thoughts every single day. 
	The Millers and the Hydes are just two of the hundreds of families of fallen soldiers who have given their lives fighting Britain's wars in the past decade. 
	Doubtless every single one of them will have their own views on whether more UK forces should put themselves in harm's way this time around."
2014-09-26,Ofgem Warns Energy Firms Over Complaints,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140926190931/http://news.sky.com/story/1342598/ofgem-warns-energy-firms-over-complaints,"The energy regulator has written to providers demanding action on how they handle customer complaints over bills and service. 
	Ofgem said more than half of consumers told a survey they were not satisfied with the so-called big six energy providers' complaints processes. 
	According to Ofgem, despite claims that the firms were improving service, complaints were continuing to rise. 
	It said a survey showed 57% of domestic and 52% of small business consumers were not satisfied with the way their complaint had been handled by their energy supplier. 
	Furthermore, in nearly half of cases where the supplier considered the case resolved, the customer did not. 
	It said satisfaction with npower and Scottish Power had fallen markedly, with only SSE managing to maintain levels of satisfaction found two years ago. 
	Ofgem chief executive Dermot Nolan said: ""These satisfaction scores are frankly awful. Almost all energy suppliers need to improve their complaints handling as a matter of urgency. 
	""There are real business benefits to good complaints handling schemes, and it shouldn't need a regulator to tell companies about the importance of this. 
	""Suppliers must now tell their customers what steps they will be taking to put things right."" 
	Mr Nolan said OfgemÂ was investigating npower over its spiralling complaints and warned it would ""take action"" against others if need be. 
	The big providers have been under fire for almost a year following a succession of above-inflation price hike announcements. 
	Earlier this month the six firms launched a campaign to reunite former customers with Â£153m of unclaimed credit on accounts, following a demand from Ofgem. 
	Although the big six firms - British Gas, npower, EDF, Scottish Power, SSE and E.On - are still the dominant providers in Britain, their market share is leaching to smaller independents. 
	A study by Cornwall Energy found that while they still control 92.4% of the market, it is down from 99.8% five years ago. 
	The Competition and Markets Authority has since launched an investigation into the structural nature of the energy sector, where companies can generate power and then sell it on at a profit to their residential arms."

	Posh Spice is following in the footsteps of Nicole Kidman, Angelina Jolie, Emma Watson, former bandmate Geri Halliwell and husband David in becoming an ambassador. 
	She will work with UNAIDS, the UN's HIV and Aids charity. 
	""It's taken me getting to 40 to realise I have a responsibility as a woman and a mother,"" said the singer-turned-designer. 
	""I recently visited South Africa and was so touched by the women I met. I felt inspired and I came home and knew I had to do something. 
	""I'm going to speak on behalf of the incredible women and the incredible charities who are working so desperately hard in these countries. I'm going to lend my voice to them because for some reason people listen to me. 
	""I need to use what I have to make a difference."" 
	The former Spice Girl missed the opening of her new London store to speak at the UN in New York - sending her husband David in her place. 
	She told reporters she still had lots to learn about whatÂ UNAIDS does. 
	""I'm not going to sit here and pretend to know everything right now, I don't. I'm learning, I have people mentoring me. I'm going back to South Africa in a few weeks and further afield next year,"" she said. 
	""It was life changing when I went to South Africa. 
	""Babies should not be born with HIV and we can stop that - we're very close to stopping that. We can't give up, we have to keep going. 
	""I feel so honoured to be here. I feel very humbled."" 
	The Beckhams have been patrons of the Elton John Aids Foundation for more than 20 years."
2014-09-26,FBI: Islamic State's Jihadi John Identified,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140926190931/http://news.sky.com/story/1342227/fbi-islamic-states-jihadi-john-identified,"By Sky News US Team FBI Director James Comey says the bureau has identified the Islamic State (IS) militant known as Jihadi John. 
	But Mr Comey told reporters at the agency's headquarters in Washington DC he would not reveal the man's name or nationality. 
	He reportedly said: ""I believe that we have identified him, I'm not going to tell you who I believe it is."" 
	Asked if he would prioritise capturing the killer, he said: ""We will do, and expend the effort that I think the American people would want us to and expect us to."" 
	The UK Home Office said it did not comment on security operations. 
	The jihadist group shocked the worldÂ when it released videos of a man with a southern English accent apparently killing two American journalists, James Foley and Steven Sotloff, and a British aid worker, David Haines. 
	In the three clips, the suspect holds a long knife and appears to begin hacking at the captives' necks. He shows only his eyes in all three videos. 
	Mr Haines widow has backed targeted British airstrikes. 
	The British Ambassador to the US, Sir Peter Westmacott, said last month the UK was close to identifying the suspect. 
	Sophisticated technology, including voice-recognition software, was being used to track him down, he added. 
	From the footage, the militantÂ appears to be left-handed and of average height and build. 
	He was said to lead a small group of British jihadis who became known by hostages as The Beatles. 
	The FBI director also said around a dozen Americans are believed to be currently fighting with extremist groups in Syria. 
	He said more than 100 Americans in total had either managed to reach Syria, had been arrested while trying to travel there, or had gone and returned. 
	In his briefing, Mr ComeyÂ said a shadowy al Qaeda cell in Syria known as the Khorasan Group may still be plotting attacks on the West. 
	He said there was no sign yet that USÂ airstrikesÂ this week, which American officials believe killed Khorasan's leader, had disrupted the group's plans. 
	It comes as the US continued to carry out airstrikes on targets in Syria - and after officials dismissed reports that IS was planning to attack US and French subway systems."

2014-09-26,Father Who Bit Baby Jailed For Her Murder,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140926190931/http://news.sky.com/story/1342032/father-who-bit-baby-jailed-for-her-murder,"A father who bit, beat, punched and shook his small baby daughter has been jailed for at least 22 years. 
	Aurimas Medvedevas, a 23-year-old from Lithuania, was sentenced at the Old Bailey for killing two-month-old Aukse. 
	It happened on September 5 last year, the day Aukse's mother - agency worker Dzesika Urbikaite - went back to work for the first time since giving birth. 
	Ms Urbikaite, 22, returned to their Peterborough home that night to find her daughter dead in her cot. She wept in court as Medvedevas was sentenced. 
	Medvedevas, of Clifton Avenue, Peterborough, had denied murder. 
	But on the third day of his trial he changed his plea to guilty in light of the overwhelming evidence against him. 
	Judge Timothy Pontius said the brutality of the attack on a defenceless baby almost defied belief. 
	He described the bite marks on her head as ""particularly shocking"". 
	The judge said the baby's hours of suffering before her eventual death ""demonstrated a callousness that is as incredible as it is inhuman"". 
	""The murder of any human being is always a tragedy, the murder of a defenceless child of any age, the more so,"" he said. 
	""The murder of a helpless infant only a few weeks old in circumstances of brutality which almost defy belief is an appalling crime beyond comprehension. 
	""The responsibility - his alone - for so horrific a crime will, I imagine, weigh heavily upon his conscience for the rest of his life. So it should."" 
	Defence lawyer Sallie Bennett-Jenkins QC said Medvedevas had shown ""heartfelt"" remorse for what he had done to his baby. 
	""The horror of having realised that his child was badly hurt will never leave this young man. What he does recall is holding her,"" she said. 
	""He recalls she died in his arms and afterwards he was terrified as to the hurt he had inflicted on her and his girlfriend who he loved very much. He was in a state of utter terror and hurt."" 
	She said that at the time of the murder Medvedevas was struggling to find work and financial ""matters were really at quite a desperate state""."
2014-09-26,Briton In Jail For Blasphemy Is Shot By Cop,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140926190931/http://news.sky.com/story/1341996/briton-in-jail-for-blasphemy-is-shot-by-cop,"A British man condemned to death for blasphemy and being held in a Pakistan prison has been shot and wounded. 
	Another man accused of the same crime was killed in the incident, which involved a Pakistani policeman, according to reports. 
	Briton Mohammad Asghar, 70, from Edinburgh, was sentenced in January and jailed in Rawalpindi for allegedly sending letters to officials claiming to be the Prophet Mohammed. 
	However, Asghar has a history of mental illness and lawyers say the issue was about a property dispute. 
	The complaint was brought against Asghar by a tenant and his family had appealed to the Government to try to keep him safe. 
	A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""We are urgently looking into reports that a British national has been injured in prison in Pakistan."" 
	Maya Foa, from human rights group Reprieve said: ""This appalling attack shows that the only way to ensure Mr Asghar's safety is to have him returned home to Britain. 
	""The UK Government must redouble their efforts on this front - and, as a first step, must urgently ensure that he is moved today to a safe location in Pakistan until he is well enough to travel. 
	""Mr Asghar is a vulnerable 70-year old man suffering from severe mental illness - a fact which has been consistently ignored by the Pakistani courts during his four-year ordeal. 
	""David Cameron said he was 'deeply concerned' about his case earlier this year - but now we must see concrete action to ensure Mr Asghar's safety."" 
	The man who died was Christian pastor Zafar Bhatti, who was involved in trying to protect fellow Christians who are in a minority in the country. 
	He was put on trial after an Islamic leader accused him in 2012 of sending derogatory text messages - even though his family said police inquiries had shown the phone was registered to another person. 
	""This is a barbaric act,"" said a spokesman for Pakistani human rights group Life for all. ""There had been threats. The court should have instructed police to ensure Bhatti's safety. 
	""Killing of a person who was falsely accused is a mockery of the judicial system. The protectors of the innocent have become the predators."" 
	At least 48 people accused of blasphemy have been extrajudicially killed, including seven in prison or outside court, the group says. 
	Blasphemy charges are hard to fight because the law does not define what is blasphemous"

	Alison Schofield was policing the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end of the stadium during the game in 1989. 
	She told the jury that a late surge of fans trying to get into the ground pinned her to a wall for almost 10 minutes before a fellow officer came to her aid. 
	""I could feel pressure on my chest making it very difficult to breathe,"" she told the inquest. 
	""It was a very frightening experience."" 
	She described how fans were passing children over the turnstiles to get in, and how some fans were becoming angry and hysterical at the crush that was developing. 
	Later, when she was called inside the ground as the disaster began to worsen, she described seeing the faces of the Liverpool fans being pressed up against the pitch-side fencing. 
	She confirmed that many of the fans were in distress and, through her medical training as a registered nurse and midwife, she could tell that one fan trapped in the crush was already dead. 
	Mrs Schofield then explained how she gave one young boy cardiac massage as a colleague administered mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. 
	She stayed with the boy until he was taken out of the ground and put in an ambulance. 
	Later, she was asked to stand guard on the terraces because of suspicions that property was being taken. 
	Her evidence was cut short as the inquest was adjourned for the rest of the week because of juror illness. 
	The hearing has previously heard that 96 Liverpool fans died at the FA Cup match against Nottingham Forest, in 1989, following crushing in the central pens at Sheffield Wednesday's ground."
2014-09-28,'Nothing Token' About Britain's Iraq Mission,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140928163658/http://news.sky.com/story/1343515/nothing-token-about-britains-iraq-mission,"Defence Secretary Michael Fallon has rejected claims Britain's role in the fight against Islamic State (IS) is a ""token"" gesture, as he confirmed RAF Tornados are now flying daily over northern Iraq. 
	He told Sky's Murnaghan programme the United States welcomes the contribution of six aircraft to the mission. 
	Mr Fallon said: ""There's nothing token about this. On the contrary, I spoke to the American Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel immediately after the vote and he welcomed the contribution that we're now able to make. 
	""They need our help, not simply with the Tornados, which are now flying daily from Cyprus, but also from the surveyance aircraft that we have overhead and very sophisticated surveyance and intelligence to add to the operations of Iraqi and Kurdish forces."" 
	His comments come after Richard Williams, a former commanding officer of the SAS who served in Bosnia, Iraq and Afghanistan, wrote in the Independent on Sunday the deployment of RAF bombers was a ""military sugar rush"" that ""risks looking fearful and half-cocked"". 
	Lieutenant Colonel Williams said the sending in of RAF bombers had ""taken on a military and political significance out of all proportion to their real military value"". 
	Lord Richards of Herstmonceux, a former head of the UK military who stepped down as chief of the defence staff last year, also told The Sunday Times that a campaign involving ground troops would be needed to crush IS. 
	The RAF carried out two sorties over Iraq on Saturday after Parliament cleared the way for airstrikes on IS militants in a vote on Friday. 
	In both missions the Tornado GR4 fighter bombers did not use their weapons, although the Ministry of Defence said ""invaluable intelligence"" had been gathered using the planes' surveillance equipment. 
	The jets, which fly in pairs, returned to their base at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus at the end of their hours-long missions with their weapons payload intact. 
	Sky's Tom Parmenter, who is at the base, says that two Tornados took off on another mission just after midday on Sunday. 
	Prime Minister David Cameron has said he also wants to make the case for targeting Syria. 
	In an interview with the Sunday Times, the Prime Minister revealed he would argue that targeting Syria is both legal and appropriate. 
	""There are complications but there aren't legal difficulties,"" he said. 
	Mr Cameron said he would respond to the challenge thrown down by Ed Miliband to seek a UN resolution supporting attacks in Syria, if only to show that his request is impossible. 
	""We have to demonstrate to people that we'd like a UN security council resolution but it's very difficult to get one and to demonstrate that what we propose is legal. Attempts have been made but there's the existence of a Russian veto."" 
	Ministers had cautioned not to expect a campaign of ""shock and awe"" and that after weeks of US airstrikes in the area it could take time to identify new targets. 
	Mr Cameron insisted the involvement of RAF combat aircraft showed Britain was there to ""play our part"" in the international coalition being assembled against IS."

	The 66-year-old star, who has colon cancer that has spread to her lungs and liver, says she wants to spend one more Christmas with her family before she passes away. 
	She is set to stop having chemo around November and believes she may lose her life by the end of January. 
	In her new autobiography, Bellingham, who was diagnosed in July last year, said how she revealed her plans to doctors. 
	In excerpts printed in a newspaper, she said: ""August 13, 2014. Yesterday was the glorious 12th - a day for us to remember because it is also the day I decided when I will die. I am very dramatic aren't I? 
	""I know it is not ultimately my decision, but it is my last vestige of control to sit in front of the oncologist and say when I would like to stop having chemo and let the natural way do its thing. 
	""I sat down with (husband) Michael and Professor Stebbing and announced: 'The time has come to cease and desist. 
	""'I would love to make one more Christmas, if possible, but I want to stop taking chemo around November in order to pass away by the end of January'."" 
	Earlier this year, the regular Loose Women panellist, whose sister Barbara died from lung cancer, picked up an OBE from Buckingham Palace, recognition for a career has spanned 40 years. 
	Highlights included TV series All Creatures Great And Small, competing in Strictly Come Dancing and starring in the touring stage production of Calendar Girls. 
	Her starring role as the mother in a squabbling family in the long-running Oxo TV adverts was first screened in the 1980s."
2014-09-28,Sex Scandal And Defection Hit Tory Conference,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140928163658/http://news.sky.com/story/1343504/sex-scandal-and-defection-hit-tory-conference,"The Conservatives have been dealt a devastating double blow after a minister quit over a sex scandal and another party MP announced he was defecting to UKIP. 
	Cabinet Office minister Brooks Newmark resigned after reportedly sending explicit pictures of himself online to an undercover tabloid newspaper reporter. 
	His announcement came just hours after Rochester and Strood MP Mark Reckless declared he was joining UKIP leader Nigel Farage's ""people's army"". 
	He is the second Conservative to defect to UKIP within a month, joining ClactonÂ MP Douglas Carswell. 
	Speaking on the BBC's The Andrew Marr show on Sunday, Prime Minister David Cameron said it was ""counterproductive and senseless"". 
	Mr Reckless was forced to cut short a visit to his constituency by his new party leader on Sunday after local Conservatives angry at his defection turned up and he received hostile questions from members of the public. 
	For the Tories arriving in Birmingham for their final party conference before the general election in May, there could hardly have been a worse start to the gathering. 
	Meanwhile, an opinion poll in the Sunday Mirror and Independent on Sunday suggests Mr Farage is more popular than the PM. 
	The setbacks overshadowed the announcementÂ of plans for a new squeeze on benefits to fund millions of new apprenticeships. 
	According to the Sunday Mirror, Mr Newmark allegedly exchanged explicit pictures over the internet with a female reporter posing as a Tory PR worker. 
	The 56-year-old married father of five tendered his resignation after learning that the newspaper was about to publish details of their exchanges. 
	He said on Sunday: ""I have been a complete fool. I have no one to blame but myself. I have hurt those I care about most. I am so, so sorry. But I just need time with my family."" 
	Fellow Conservative Nadine Dorries told Sky's Murnaghan programme she didn't think the claims are ""that big a deal"". 
	Downing Street said that Reading East MP Rob Wilson had been appointed the new Civil Society Minister. 
	Mr Reckless received an ecstatic reception from UKIP activists at their party conference in Doncaster after he declared he was leaving the Tories. 
	He accused the leadership of failing to keep its promises on Europe, the economy and immigration. 
	""People feel ignored, taken for granted, over-taxed, over-regulated, ripped off and lied to,"" he declared to rapturous applause. 
	He dismissed the PM's promise of an in/out EU referendumÂ as a ""device"" designed to deliver the ""pre-ordained"" result in favour of Britain's continued membership. 
	There was deep anger in the Conservative ranks at Mr Reckless's move, with a party spokesman denouncing the defection as ""completely illogical"". 
	Mr Reckless's constituency party chairman, Andrew Mackness, said that he was ""astonished and disgusted"" at the decision, and said he had been given assurances by Mr Reckless that he would not defect. 
	Like Mr Carswell, Mr Reckless said that he would be standing down as an MP in order to fight the seat as a UKIP candidate in a by-election. 
	Although he took the Kent constituency with a majority of almost 10,000 at the last general election, he may face a tough battle to return to Westminster. 
	In his last act as a Tory MP, Mr Reckless rebelled against the Government in the Commons vote on airstrikes against Islamic State."
2014-09-28,UKIP Defection Is Triple Nightmare For Cameron,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140928163658/http://news.sky.com/story/1343689/ukip-defection-is-triple-nightmare-for-cameron,"By Faisal Islam, Political Editor The Prime Minister rises at 5.15am on a working day. 
	At that moment on Saturday the banners were being hung in Birmingham, the lifts festooned, and individual staircase steps swathed with constituent economic achievements leading to an overall tagline: ""Securing A Better Future"". 
	The basic sell: a recovery is here, but the country needs the Conservatives to finish the job. 
	And then, David Cameron would have been forgiven for seeing a clear route to glory in May starting with his trip to Birmingham for the Conservative Party conference. 
	A thumping majority in a successful Parliamentary vote was the fruition of weeks of slow deliberative work on Islamic State (IS), to show a diplomatic, humanitarian, multilateral effort. 
	Even then, the vote seemed most difficult for Labour leader Ed Miliband, losing one rising frontbench star, and having to fire an aide to the shadow defence secretary. 
	The papers were beginning to question Mr Miliband's position of backing airstrikes against IS in Syria by the US and Arab allies, but requiring an effort to get a UN resolution for the RAF to join them. 
	And then there was his opponents' speech in Manchester. 
	He didn't watch it, but read it and felt confident enough to tell the Sunday Times it was 'guff'. 
	The weekend papers had carried the first of the Conservative grid announcements: a Mail story extending discounts to 100,000 first-time buyers, the Sunday Times on welfare caps to fund extra apprenticeships. 
	A strong performance in front of a united Conservative party learning a disciplined message on the economic recovery is exactly the sort of base from which to turn around the Labour Party's extraordinarily impervious poll lead, and confirm the traditional swing to an incumbent government. 
	And then came Reckless and Newmark. Two very different Conservative MPs. 
	A self-inflicted wound from a minister, obliged to resign by a salacious newspaper sting hours before the start of a vital pre-election conference. 
	But Mark Reckless' defection to UKIP is a triple nightmare. 
	The loss of an MP, to UKIP, and the attendant distraction of a by-election that will be far closer than Clacton. 
	The fact of it is compounded by the method. It was designed for maximum timing embarrassment. Again it was kept a secret. 
	The sheer pleasure the assembled crowd was extraordinary to behold. UKIP are showing clear competence in these theatrical defections. 
	But Mr Reckless joined Douglas Carswell in laying out not just policy differences, but personal problems with David Cameron's style. 
	In particular an 'away day' attempt to get precisely the same type of message discipline from MPs as exudes from the Birmingham ICC. 
	Both defectors mentioned the treatment of the independent-minded and far from Ukippy MP Sarah Wollaston. This establishes method and motive for yet more defections. 
	We already have half of an ex-Tory ""Gang of Four"". Remember the pundits saying that May was UKIP's high watermark? 
	Conservatives might try to take comfort from the fact that UKIP will also do well in certain Labour seats, beginning with the Heywood and Middleton by-election. 
	But the threat is clearly asymmetrical. 
	At the Labour fringe, they were developing policies and messages to defeat UKIP as 'more Tory than the Tories'. 
	At the Conservative fringe, they'll be discussing how to adopt UKIP policy, or how to join them. Or one might argue that the Conservative fringe is UKIP. 
	So Mr Cameron started Saturday with a clear path. 
	A push into the centre ground, and a grab for the 6% of Labour voters who think George Osborne has run the economy well could mean, whisper it, a majority. 
	But the PM finds himself fighting on two fronts, and one of them a very old war. I expect some sort of extraction from the European Convention on Human Rights. 
	""The status quo cannot continue"" was all one insider would say. Is that enough to sate the frustration of UKIP-tempted Tory activists, voters and MPs? Almost certainly not. An offer for England might help. 
	After a tough week, incredibly, Ed Miliband could be forgiven for having a half-smile. 
	David Cameron will be relieved that his opposite number did not claim that ""PM-in-waiting"" mantle last week. But that relief was rather short-lived."
2014-09-28,"Tory Plan To Lower Benefits Cap To Â£23,000",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140928163658/http://news.sky.com/story/1343488/tory-plan-to-lower-benefits-cap-to-23000,"By Anushka Asthana, political correspondent David Cameron will today pledge to lower the benefit cap from Â£26,000-a-year per family to Â£23,000 if his party wins the election. 
	The party will also lay out plans to strip 18 to 21-year-olds of jobseeker's allowance and instead given them a six-month limited allowance. 
	After it runs out they will have to take up an apprenticeship, job or do daily community work for their benefits. 
	The hope is that an even tougher stance on welfare will appeal to the electorate, as polls suggest the cap has been one of the coalition's most popular policies. 
	It has been sold as being about fairness, by ensuring no one on benefits earns more than the average working family. 
	But it has been hugely controversial among charities. 
	They point out that the families worst affected are those with large numbers of children who would receive a benefit top-up if they were working. 
	The money saved will be ploughed into three millionÂ apprenticeships over the next Parliament. 
	The policy was meant to be the centrepiece of the first day of the final annual conference before the general election. 
	But it was overshadowed by news of another defection to UKIP and resignation of a minister over allegations he sent sexually explicit pictures over the internet.Â  
	Mr Cameron said todayâs policy would give young people a ""better, more secure future"". 
	George Osborne, the Chancellor, added that the aim was to say ""it's not acceptable for young people to go from school straight to benefits"". 
	It came as the PM admitted that he had thought about resigning over Scotland if he had lost the vote. 
	In an interview with the Sunday Times, he said: ""I thought about it a lot. Emotionally I would have been very winded and wounded. 
	""I thought in many ways that is what I would want to do. 
	""I would have felt it as a huge blow. I'm very glad I didn't have to say it."" 
	Mr Cameron added that he did not sleep on the night of the referendum despite trying, and ended up in the press office at 3am as the results came in. 
	His children also got up, sensing his nerves, and sat on his knee. But he told the newspaper that in the end it would have been his ""duty"" to carry on. 
	He also insisted that he would serve a full term if he won the next election. 
	And he told the newspaper that he wanted to make the case for extending military action against IS to Syria, insisting: ""We think we could do more. 
	""We have to demonstrate to people that we'd like a UN security council resolution but it's very difficult to get one and to demonstrate that what we propose is legal. 
	""Attempts have been made but there's the existence of a Russian veto."""
2014-09-28,Video Vigilantes Chasing Down Dangerous Drivers,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140928163658/http://news.sky.com/story/1343501/video-vigilantes-chasing-down-dangerous-drivers,"By Emma Birchley, East of England Correspondent Dangerous drivers should be keeping their eyes peeled not just for police after it emerged that tens of thousands of motorists and cyclists are recording every journey they make. 
	That footage is then being used to help settle insurance claims but also to help stretched police forces pursue cases of bad driving. 
	Cyclist Dave Sherry has recorded 400 incidents in the past two years that have resulted in dozens of convictions and cautions. 
	""A couple of years ago I had an incident involving a bad driver. I called the police and they said it's your word against his and I decided on video evidence,"" he said. 
	""It's indisputable and it basically fits on the bike to show the bad drivers for who they are."" 
	The consequences can be extremely serious. 
	One bus driver lost his job last year after being videoed by Mr Sherry looking down at a handset while driving along the road with passengers on board. 
	It means his actions are not popular with everyone. 
	A van driver in Leyton, east London, described such behaviour as ""nosy"". 
	""I don't like it. I don't even like the CCTV cameras about if I'm honest,"" he said. ""It's people spying on each other."" 
	Some police forces are more than happy to use footage from the public but others say they simply do not have the resources to deal with it except in the most serious cases.Â  
	Now the Home office is leading a project to come up with ""common standards"" on how such video should be used by the police and criminal justice service. 
	The Association of Chief Police Officers encourages the public to provide evidence to police. 
	Chief Constable Giles York, of the National Policing Lead for Digital Evidence, said: ""With motoring offences, videos filmed from dashboard mounted cameras are admissible as evidence, and assuming that the quality is good and the evidence can be corroborated the police will record, report and consider the circumstances of each case on its merits."" 
	One company, Policewitness.com, is making it easier for the drivers and cyclists to get their footage to the right force. 
	Chairman Matt Stockdale, a former senior police officer, said they receive hundreds of clips some weeks. 
	""Now that we have a stretched force, no matter where you are in the country the result is very few people are proactively pulled over and given advice for their driving, so it falls back to us the public. 
	""The public have demonstrated time and time again, now with tens of thousands of motorists and cyclists recording their journeys every day, it's shown me they are not going to stand by and be a victim."""
2014-09-28,Abu Qatada Says He's Forgotten About Britain,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140928163658/http://news.sky.com/story/1343445/abu-qatada-says-hes-forgotten-about-britain,"By Tom Rayner, Middle East Reporter Radical preacher Abu Qatada has told Sky News he has ""forgotten all about Britain"", three days after being cleared of terror charges by a Jordanian court. 
	Instead, it seems his focus is now on the Islamic State and the US-led airstrikes against it. 
	Although refused a full interview, the Sky News team were allowed to sit in on a discussion, taking place in the garden of his home in Amman. 
	In the balmy evening air on the northern outskirts of the Jordanian capital, Qatada - the man who UK authorities fought for eight years to deport - was holding court. 
	Tens of well-wishers came through, congratulating him on his acquittal and release, as the group discussed the attacks on IS in Syria and Iraq. 
	But this was no ordinary gathering. 
	Among those present was another al Qaeda-affiliated jihadist recently released from Jordanian prison, Sheik Abu Mohammed al Maqdisi. 
	Al Maqdisi is often described as the ""mentor"" to Abu MoussabÂ al Zarqawi - the man who founded the group al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) from which IS grew. 
	From this extraordinary discussion came one very clear message: the US-led airstrikes were a ""crusade against Islam"". 
	That sentiment echoes statements made by the al Qaeda-affiliated rebel group fighting in Syria, JahbatÂ al Nusra. 
	That shouldnât come as much of a surprise, given both Qatada and alÂ Maqdisi remain two of the most influential al Qaeda-supportive jihadist thinkers in the world. 
	The recent release of Qatada and alÂ Maqdisi from Jordanian prisons has been seen as potentially connected to their clear condemnations of IS. 
	Fatwas issued by the men carry considerable weight amongst jihadist thinking globally. 
	And their criticisms of the actions of IS have the potential to do serious damage to any credibility it may have in the eyes of those sympathetic to its cause. 
	However, addressing the group, alÂ Maqdisi slammed theÂ airstrikes describing them as a ""crusade against all of Islam"". 
	He pointed out they are not only targeting IS fighters, but those of al Nusra too. 
	Al MaqdisiÂ said efforts of himself and Qatada to persuade IS militants they had been ""deceived"" - under way before the airstrikes - have now been dashed. 
	Asked how he feels now about his deportation battle with the UK, Qatada told Sky: ""I've left Britain and I've forgotten all about Britain."" 
	Pushed for further comments, Qatada said he was not prepared to give an interview as he didnât want to ""say things in instalments"". 
	But Qatada - once labelled ""Bin Laden's right-hand man in Europe"" - said he would issue a comprehensive statement on the situation soon."
2014-09-28,Stand Up Be Counted: Questions PM Must Answer,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140928163658/http://news.sky.com/story/1343477/stand-up-be-counted-questions-pm-must-answer,"By Michael Adams Having attended my first party conference last week in Manchester, I'm now looking forward to the Conservative gathering in Birmingham - it will be interesting to see the differences and similarities between the two events and the parties. 
	With Parliament being recalled, I expect that foreign policy and defence will be talked about by all those who attend. 
	But as a young person I will be wanting to see if the Tories have plans to support lowering the voting age to 16, which has been a popular issue on the Stand UpÂ Be Counted website. 
	Another important issue for me is how the Tories plan to create more careers, not just jobs, for young people. 
	The unemployment rate for young people is a concern for all parties. 
	Labour have outlined that they would approach the problem by creating more apprenticeship and put an end to zero-hour contracts. 
	I would like to see the Conservatives support the end of zero-hour contracts and explain their plan to lower the jobless rate. 
	If the UK economy is to get back to being the strongest in the world, there needs to be careers for young people to progress in. 
	Shadow chancellor Ed Balls has told us of his plans to restore the 50p top rate of income taxÂ and bring back the 10p tax band for the lowest paid. 
	I expect the Tories will say nothing of these policies but talk of plans to promote business. 
	I also imagine they will try to pick holes in Labour's plans and tell us that more spending cuts are needed over the next five years. 
	As for David Cameron, I think that after Ed Miliband's speech he will look to deliver a smooth, crisp speech to show voters that he is the leader they need and want. 
	Having gone to the party conferences with a open mind, I'm not sure how I will feel by the end - but I'll wait and see if I was right or wrong on the issues discussed."
2014-09-28,"UKIP Defections: PM Did Too Little, Too Late",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140928163658/http://news.sky.com/story/1343419/ukip-defections-pm-did-too-little-too-late,"During the 2010 election, I travelled to Rochester and Strood in Kent, where I met the Tory candidate Mark Reckless. 
	One thing that struck me as I watched him take to the doorsteps, was the number of constituents raising the issue of immigration. 
	One awkward incident involved an elderly man ranting about why he supported the far-right National Front. Mr Reckless backed off, embarrassed. 
	He certainly didnât share those extreme views. But it was clear then that he was a politician who was worried about immigration and angry about Europe. 
	I remember another conversation with Mr Reckless last year in the Commons. 
	Tory backbenchers were nervous about immigration, he told me. They felt David Cameron hadnât done enough, and the looming prospect of transitional controls lifted on Bulgarians and Romanians was of particular concern.Â  
	Things could get tetchy in January 2015, he said. 
	Mr Cameron knew about these misgivings among his MPs and tried to act on them. 
	Late last year he unveiled a toughening up in the rhetoric on immigration â bringing in new rules to crack down on the access that new EU migrants would get to benefits. Then came the pledge of an EU referendum. 
	The hope was to appease the concerns of people like Mr Reckless, and you might have thought it was working. 
	After all, following the defection to UKIP of Douglas Carswell many asked the MP if he would be next. He insisted not. 
	When I texted Tracey Crouch, a neighbouring MP in Kent, about his decision to leave the Tories, she replied: ""Nothing I can say right now would be becoming of a lady. Iâm so angry. He looked me in the eye and promised he wasnât going to defect."" 
	Others pointed out that he was openly supportive of the Conservatives as recently as yesterday. 
	Then he tweeted: ""Good to lead coach for Team2015 campaigning in Birmingham Northfield on Sunday + will be followed by our Clacton action next Thursday."" 
	That is why Tory sources say they are ""surprised"". Other MPs told me they felt ""let down"", ""frustrated"" and ""fed up"". 
	""Another battle when we should be fighting Labour,"" said one. 
	Others argued that although he had behaved irresponsibly, giving a leg-up to Ed Miliband, that a number of backbenchers were angry with the partyâs position on Europe. 
	They believe that Mr Cameron hasnât done enough to prove he can loosen Britainâs ties to the EU. They want to see the issue addressed at his conference speech this week. 
	The problem for men like Mr Reckless is they donât share the Prime Ministerâs views on Europe. 
	Mr Cameron wants to reform the UKâs relationship with the continent and then â ideally â campaign for us to stay IN. 
	And that is the sticking point with Mr Reckless. 
	The former Tory MP was clear today that he believes in an independent Britain, and wants to follow the Scotland Yes campaign with what he said was a positive, patriotic message for voters. 
	He wants OUT â and UKIP is the only party that is fully with him."
2014-09-28,UKIP Defection Timed For Maximum Damage,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140928163658/http://news.sky.com/story/1343305/ukip-defection-timed-for-maximum-damage,"By Joey Jones, Deputy Political Editor MP Mark Reckless, who has defected from the Conservatives to UKIP, has a good poker face. 
	Ever since Douglas Carswell switched to Nigel Farage's party last month, Mr Reckless has been the name most often mentioned as the next Tory likely to jump ship. 
	He has not shown any outward sign of being tempted. 
	However, it was notable that when he tweeted on Friday explaining his decision not to support military action in Iraq, his tone was notably similar to UKIP leader Mr Farage. 
	""I voted against bombing ISIL in Iraq,"" he tweeted. ""A year ago we were asked to bomb other side in Syria + what good did 557 MPs voting to attack Libya do?"" 
	Even so, his appearance hours later at the UKIP conference in Doncaster is an undeniable coup for the party. 
	And it will dominate the opening of the Tories' own gathering in Birmingham which is just getting under way. 
	While both Mr Carswell and Mr Reckless have been among the more rebellious Tory MPs, party strategists know that neither can be dismissed as mere loose cannons. 
	In effect, UKIP is waging a guerrilla war against its Westminster rivals, and thus far it has been frighteningly effective. 
	The party's ability to time its defections to cause maximum damage, in the full glare of publicity, will be giving Tory strategists nightmares. 
	Labour, too perhaps, given that Mr Farage has vowed to turn his fire on them too. 
	UKIP strategists boast they had Mr Reckless in the bag two months ago. 
	Who would now bet against there being others, similarly ready to be unveiled at the moment of greatest advantage."

	The planning and preparation for British airstrikes is now at full pace at RAF Akrotiri and everyone on the base on Cyprus knows their mission has now escalated. 
	On Saturday morning the Tornado crews strode out across the tarmac, two teams of two, helmets on. 
	They knew the cameras were there to capture the moment that debate and politics gave way to military action. The deployment of British bombs in Iraq is now in their hands. 
	Now that this is a combat mission their identities are protected, all we know is that they are some of the RAF's most skilled and experienced individuals. 
	Their families will know that their loved ones are now going to war rather than simply flying reconnaissance missions over Iraq. 
	The intelligence gathering will continue apace on these sorties and there may be flights in the coming days and weeks where they don't need to deploy missiles. 
	Military planners call the mission ""dynamic"" - it means that the plans will change according to what's happening on the ground. 
	The professionalism of everyone who works to support these missions means they want to respond to the orders efficiently and carry out their job as precisely as possible. 
	Every time they leave this base the ground crews will wave them off, every time they return they'll be relieved to welcome them back.

	MPs have voted overwhelmingly in favour of their deployment; 524 Yes and and 43 Noes in favour of the motion. 
	To begin with, just six Tornados - already being used for surveillance - will be armed and ready for action. 
	The result came after a creditable, statesmanlike day-long debate. 
	But there were some political casualties - Shadow Education Minister Rushanara Ali resigned from the front bench, and Iain McKenzie, an aide to Shadow Defence Secretary Vernon Coaker, was sacked, after abstaining and voting against the motion respectively. 
	In reality there were two debates. A tightly worded formal debate motion on Iraq, and a shadow debate on Syria. 
	The PM's personal view, expressed in this debate, was: It would be justified and legal to extend action into Syria. And, in a ""humanitarian disaster"", it might not require an advance parliamentary mandate. 
	This muddied the waters a little. Number 10 later clarified that this would have to be a ""Benghazi"" style imminent massacre. 
	Given that the US and allies are already bombing IS in Syria, it would hardly come as a surprise. But it did not affect the result in Parliament. 
	The main vote's thumping majority was by design. 
	The PM had sought the backing of Ed Miliband in a phone call from the UN in New York on Wednesday. 
	The motion was accordingly tightly drafted on tactics (no combat troops) and territory (Iraq only). 
	But it was not just a consequence of Labour caution, the Liberal Democrats too have been a break on this process. 
	For Labour's part, Mr Miliband suggested that it would be better to get a UN Mandate for any extension of action to Syria. 
	Back in the chamber the critiques ranged in from different directions: ""The mission creep hasn't even waited until the end of the debate,"" said George Galloway. 
	Ken Clarke pointed out that the action was basically symbolic, and involved six planes. 
	Senior Tory backbenchers including Liam Fox and Andrew Mitchell called for a mandate for airstrikes in Syria. 
	All this debate, the publication of legal advice, and front bench Labour resignations for late entry to just a part of ongoing military action, that would occur regardless. 
	So the airstrikes start soon, but perhaps the real significance is the cementing of Britain's changed world role."

	The bodies of David Miller and Hannah Witheridge were found on a beach on the island of Koh Tao on September 15. 
	A blood-stained garden hoe, which is thought to be the murder weapon, was discovered nearby. 
	It is believed at least three men were involved in the attack. 
	A group of Thai footballers are the latest people to be questioned by detectives, amid fears the hunt for those responsible for the murders has stalled. 
	A spokesman for the Royal Thai Police confirmed DNA samples have been taken from ""more than eight"" footballers who reportedly threw a late-night party at the nightclub where the victims were on the night they died. 
	Officers are awaiting the results. 
	Police colonel Kissana Phathanacharoen said a reward of 700,000 baht - which is roughly Â£13,300 - was now being offered for information. 
	""We're trying to narrow our inquiries and collect more evidence,"" he said. ""We're encouraging the public who many have information to come forward. 
	""We're checking DNA but this is not the only thing we are looking at to prosecute the suspects."" 
	Post-mortem examinations revealed that Ms Witheridge, 23, from Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, died from head wounds, while Mr Miller, 24, from Jersey, suffered severe blows to the head and subsequently drowned. 
	Ian Miller, David's father, earlier this week said he thought his son might have intervened to help Hannah during an argument. 
	""It has become clearer and clearer that it is quite likely David was stepping in to help a girl who was in trouble,"" he told the Daily Mail. 
	Around 150 police have been sent to the island to try to find the killers. 
	In light of the killings, Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan has instructed police forces to fit more security cameras in tourist destinations, and wants more streetlights in these areas to deter criminals, the Phuket Gazette reported. 
	A group of Burmese migrants interviewed by officers after bloodstains were found on their clothing were eliminated from inquiries last week. 
	No matches were found between them and DNA found on Ms Witheridge and a cigarette butt at the scene. 
	Police have previously said they were looking for three Westerners who were seen playing a guitar near Sairee beach."

	Santosh Benjamin Muthiah managed to save his two young daughters - aged three months and three years old - by passing them to neighbours through a window at his North London home. 
	However the 36-year-old was overcome by smoke and died two days after the fire. 
	A wide-ranging number of recommendations put forward by London Fire Brigade and Hertfordshire Trading Standards â including forcing manufacturers to reveal emergency safety concerns in a public database - were backed by coroner Andrew Walker. 
	Under the proposals, failure to report faulty products could lead to unlimited fines and even prison sentences. 
	Lawyers acting for Mr Muthiah's family said the changes ""would stop manufacturers keeping safety issues secret"". 
	Mr Walker blamed a defrost timer on the familyâs Beko fridge-freezer as he recorded a narrative verdict at North London Coroner's Court for the death in November 2010. 
	Manufacturer Beko was aware of a possible safety issue as far back as 2003, the inquest heard, but failed to rectify it. 
	However, Mr Walker said a produce recall may not have prevented the blaze. 
	Clayton Witter, former managing director at Beko, said the concern had been judged as not adequate enough to warrant a safety recall despite a ""serious risk"" to safety. 
	The victimâs wife, Dr Jennifer Benjamin, said the family had been unaware of any safety concerns. 
	The inquest heard that manufacturers can currently be fined Â£5,000 for faults, compared with an average cost of Â£11m to recall a white goods appliance. 
	A statement issued by Dr Benjamin after the inquest read: ""We sincerely hope that this legal exercise results in changes to prevent incidents of this nature in the future."" 
	A spokesman for the Business, Innovation and Skills Department said: ""We are yet to receive the coroner's report in this particular case but when we do we will, of course, carefully consider the recommendations and respond in due course."""
2014-09-28,First-Time Buyers To Get 20% Off Under Tories,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140928163658/http://news.sky.com/story/1343014/first-time-buyers-to-get-20-percent-off-under-tories,"Young first-time buyers will get a 20% discount on their new homes, under plans announced by the Conservatives. 
	David Cameron has set out plans to build tens of thousands of new homes on commercial ""brownfield"" land, reserved for first-time buyers, under 40. 
	As Tories begin gathering in Birmingham for their annual conference, the PM said a Conservative government would implement the plan if they were re-elected in 2015. 
	Homes built under the proposed Help to Buy: Starter Homes scheme would be exempt from a range of taxes, lowering their price by 20%, say Tories. 
	In an interview with The Sun, Mr Cameron said the programme would deliver 100,000 starter homes over the lifetime of the next parliament. 
	""We want to help more young people achieve the dream of home ownership so today as part of our long-term economic plan I can pledge we will build 100,000 homes for young, first-time buyers,"" he said. 
	""We will make these starter homes 20% cheaper by exempting them from a raft of taxes and by using brownfield land. 
	""I don't want to see young people locked out of home ownership. 
	""We've already started to tackle the problem with Help to Buy mortgages - and these new plans will help tens of thousands more people to buy their first home."" 
	The Conservatives said the homes would be built on brownfield land already zoned for development but no longer needed for industrial or commercial use. 
	Such land is not normally made available for housebuilding and can be bought more cheaply than other land, and the savings will be passed on to the buyer. 
	Public sector land which is surplus to requirements will also be brought into the scheme. 
	At the same time, the Conservatives said that the properties would be exempt from most of the taxes imposed on new homes. 
	These taxes include the social housing requirement and the community infrastructure levy. 
	Some future regulations such as the zero carbon homes standard will also not apply to properties built under the scheme. 
	The announcement is intended to set the tone for the party's final annual conference before the country goes to the polls next May."
2014-09-28,NHS To Pay For Ashya King's Cancer Treatment,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140928163658/http://news.sky.com/story/1342841/nhs-to-pay-for-ashya-kings-cancer-treatment,"The NHS is to pay for Ashya King's cancer treatment in Czech capital Prague, it has been announced. 
	The five-year-old's parents prompted a police hunt across Europe in August when they took him from hospital in Southampton without doctors' consent. 
	His parents, Brett and Naghemeh King, were detained as Portsmouth City Council launched legal action against them. 
	But the High Court later ruled he could be taken to the Czech Republic and he has since been undergoing treatment at Prague's Proton Therapy Centre (PTC) as part of his recovery from surgery on a brain tumour. 
	And a statement issued by NHS England said: ""Our thoughts are with Ashya and his family as he begins follow-on radiotherapy. 
	""Now that Ashya is in Prague, it is clearly best that Ashya continues to be treated uninterrupted so the NHS has agreed to fund this care, as requested by his parents, in accordance with relevant European cross-border arrangements. 
	""We all join in wishing him well, and greatly hope he makes a full and successful recovery."" 
	Sources told Sky News they would continue to judge treatment on a case-by-case basis and that Ashya'sÂ case did not set a precedent for other patients. 
	The PTC, in a statement on its website, outlined the difference between proton beam therapy and conventional radiotherapy. 
	It said: ""Proton therapy can be much better modulated and precisely focused into the tumour volume. In case of irradiation ofÂ medulloblastoma in Ashya, it is necessary to apply the highest possible dose into the former location but protect the tissue around as much as possible. 
	""In Ashya's case, those are vital structures of the heart, lung, liver and intestines."" 
	Proton therapy would decrease the dose to other parts of the body, including the heart, liver and intestines and trachea by up to 80%, the PTC said. 
	""This means decreasing the risk of developing cardiovascular disorders, breathing disorders or metabolic disorders on the first place and better protection of the swallowing functions and normal food intake,"" the statement added."
2014-09-28,Radical Preacher: Arrest 'Politically Motivated',https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140928163658/http://news.sky.com/story/1342869/radical-preacher-arrest-politically-motivated,"Radical preacher Anjem Choudary says his arrest was ""politically motivated"" after being released on bail on suspicion of being a member of a banned terrorist group. 
	He was one of 11 men held as part of a police investigation into alleged support of extremist group Al Muhajiroun. 
	The 47-year-old, who is to answer bail in January, tweeted: ""I've been released from police custody. 
	""Just in time for Cameron to declare war on Islam & Muslims in Iraq & Syria."" 
	He was among nine men, aged between 22 and 51, held in London on suspicion of being members of a terror organisation and encouraging terrorism. 
	Two more were stopped and detained near junction 1 of the M6, just outside Rugby, Warwickshire. 
	One of the arrested men - 39-year-old Trevor Brookes - has been charged with two counts of breaching his notification requirement, while seven others have been bailed. 
	The pair held on M6 remained in custody. 
	A number of properties - 11 in east London, one in west London, one in northwest London, five in south London and one in Stoke-on-Trent - were searched as part of the investigation. 
	One of them was Yummy Yummy, a sweet shop in Whitechapel, East London, owned by Mr Choudary's brother Yadzani. 
	Mr ChoudaryÂ said after his release: ""My arrest certainly was politically motivated. 
	""The last time the government proscribed any organisation linked to me or previous groups I have been linked to was in June 2014. 
	""They have done nothing since then. They waited until the day before a major vote on a war against Muslims for a high-profile series of arrests."" 
	Mr Choudary said he was questioned at Southwark police station about being a member of up to 10 banned groups including Islam4UK and Need4Khalifah. 
	He was reported to have said this week he had no sympathy for aid worker Alan Henning, who has been captured by the Islamic State in Syria. 
	He reportedly said: ""In the Koran it is not allowed for you to feel sorry for non Muslims. I don't feel sorry for him."" 
	Al Muhajiroun was set up by Mr Choudary and Sheikh Omar Bakri Mohammad, who was told he could not return to the UK after the 7/7 bombings. 
	The organisation was banned in the UK in 2010."

	The 21-year-old gets more hits to his Pointless Blog than many primetime television shows with 5m views a month and he has a staggering 1.5m Twitter followers. 
	When he celebrated his 21st birthday last week it trended worldwide on the social networking site and he wasÂ mobbed by thousands of girls during a series of book signings. 
	He told Sky News' Entertainment Week: ""I think what people love about vlogging is that we aren't celebrities, we're just normal people and I film these videos in my bedroom, I'm just like those people watching except I'm on the other side of the screen. I think it's the normality that people love."" 
	The vlogger has now turned to old-fashioned print for his latest project - the Pointless Book - which is part activity, part journal and designed specifically for his fans. 
	""It is quite traditional. I thought it would be a cool idea because, I give them so much content online but nothing that represents me physically."" 
	""I feel that if I can portray a positive message then obviously that is going benefit a lot of people then I can help someone one who's having a hard time or family issues and they can have five minutes and enjoy my video - that's the aim."" 
	After five years producing content for his channel, the 21 year old is keeping his eye out for the next big thing. 
	""It's hard to know what the future holds because YouTube has grown so fast. Something could pop tomorrow that could change everything, something could pop up next year, nothing could pop up, you never really know what's going to happen.

2014-09-28,DLT Sentenced For Groping TV Personality,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140928163658/http://news.sky.com/story/1342579/dlt-sentenced-for-groping-tv-personality,"Disgraced DJ Dave Lee Travis has left court after being given a three-month suspended sentence for indecently assaulting a TV personality. 
	Speaking to reporters outside, the former Radio 1 star said he was ""mortified"" and ""really disappointed"" over his conviction this week and criticised his prosecution. 
	He said the judge accepted that prosecutors had failed to prove their case that he was a ""sexual predator"". 
	Travis said: ""I was worried if the prosecution threw enough mud at me, some of it might stick"", adding it was ""of little comfort that I was acquitted of so many others (alleged offences)"". 
	He said of those people closest to him: ""We all know the truth and I'm grateful for that."" 
	Travis, who became a household name in the 1970s, was found guilty on Tuesday of indecently assaulting a woman in 1995. 
	He was sentenced to three months in prison, suspended for two years. 
	The incident took place behind the scenes at The Mrs Merton Show, a programme which the victim had been working on as a researcher. 
	The DJ had squeezed her breasts for 10-15 seconds after cornering her in a corridor of a BBC studio. 
	The victim had been smoking in the corridor when he commented on her ""poor little lungs"" before groping her. 
	Sentencing the 69-year-old man at London's Southwark Crown Court, Judge Leonard said: ""It was an intentional and unpleasant sexual assault. 
	""You took advantage of a young woman in a vulnerable position whose job it was to look after you that day."" 
	In the dock, Travis briefly looked down and then said: ""Thank you, your honour"". 
	Marianne, his wife of more than 40 years, hugged a friend in the public gallery after the judge delivered his sentence. 
	In a statement read out ahead of his sentencing, the victim said: ""I was subjected to an unprovoked and terrifying physical assault at my place of work. 
	""I was too paralysed with fear to confront my assailant."" 
	Before sentencing, journalist Camilla Long said Travis had ""bashed"" on the dock glass and ""screamed"" at her to move from the seats behind him in the public gallery to the press seats, as she was making him ""uncomfortable"". 
	Ms Long, who in 2012 wrote an article in which she claimed Travis had groped her during an interview, told Sky News the incident in court on Friday was ""incredibly intimidating"". 
	This week, Travis was found not guilty on a second indecent assault charge and the jury was discharged after it was unable to agree a verdict on a count of sexual assault. 
	He faced a retrial after jurors failed to reach verdicts on those two charges earlier this year. 
	He was cleared of 12 counts of indecent assault at his original trial in February. 
	The broadcaster, of Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, was first arrested in October 2012 under Operation Yewtree, Scotland Yard's investigation into historic sexual abuse in the wake of allegations against the late DJ Jimmy Savile. 
	Judge Leonard said Travis' offence was of a ""different order of magnitude"" to other more serious convictions under Operation Yewtree."

	Along with more than a dozen police forces across the country, the air force has provided support with ""aerial analysis"" - which allows officers on the ground to focus their efforts to find the 14-year-old, who disappeared five weeks ago. 
	Runners taking part in a half-marathon in Ealing, west London, have worn yellow ribbons to raise awareness of Alice's disappearance. 
	Ribbons have also been tied to trees and fences along the route, which runs close to where Alice was last seen. 
	Kelvin Walker, race director for the event, told Sky News: ""We thought it would be a really good idea to give some runners bows to run around the course. 
	""The course is now covered in ribbons and it's quite an emotional sight to see, so we're just really happy to be involved in helping them."" 
	The schoolgirl, from Hanwell, west London, disappeared on 28 August. She was filmed on CCTV walking along the towpath of the Grand Union Canal towards Hanwell at 4.26pm, but has not been seen since. 
	On Saturday, police revealed that footage from 300 CCTV cameras is now being analysed, taken from a six-square-mile radius. 
	Officers will continue to search scrubland along the towpath near the canal. 
	A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ""This continues to be a massive investigation. 
	""A range of officers and staff from across the Met are taking part in the ever-expanding search for Alice."" 
	Police received 150 phone calls after staging a reconstruction of the teenager's last known movements. 
	Convicted murderer Arnis Zalkalns, the prime suspect in her disappearance, who has also vanished, was filmed cycling the same route behind the teenager. 
	But police stress the Latvian, who was also accused of molesting a 14-year-old girl in 2009, was just ""one line of inquiry"". 
	A reward of up to Â£20,000 is being offered for anyone who has information that leads police to find Alice."

	The 15-year-old, who is yet to be named, is currently in Turkey, and police are urgently trying to find her before she crosses the border. 
	Although she left for school as normal on the morning of her disappearance last week, the teenager was nowhere to be seen when her father went to pick her up at the end of the day. 
	She is believed to be with a 17-year-old woman, also of Somali descent, from Lambeth. 
	""There are indications she may have been radicalised, but at the moment, our priority is to find her before she crosses the border to Syria,"" said Assistant Chief ConstableÂ Louisa Rolfe, of Avon and Somerset Police. 
	The student, from Bristol, has been described as ""incredibly bright, articulate and popular"" by her family in a statement. 
	Ms Rolfe added: ""We must all be vigilant and ready to stop the signs of radicalisation. Often, young people who go to Syria can be naÃ¯ve and don't recognise that they are being sucked into joining extremist groups. 
	""This is not about criminalising these young people, it's about preventing tragedies."" 
	Cllr Hibaq JamaÂ has issued a message on the family's behalf. It read: ""Please come back. We miss you very much. You are not in any trouble. We just want you to be safe and to come home as soon as possible."""
2014-09-30,GP Practices Face Closure Over Dangerous Care,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140930145022/http://news.sky.com/story/1344522/gp-practices-face-closure-over-dangerous-care,"By Thomas Moore, Health Correspondent Up to 200 GP practices across England face the threat of closure for providing potentially dangerous care to thousands of patients, the chief inspector of family doctors has warned. 
	In his first major broadcast interview, Professor Steve Field told Sky News that a handful of surgeries would be shut down straight away after being found guilty of ""serious failings"". 
	And he said scores more would be given a year to improve - or face being closed down as well. 
	The warning comes as the Conservatives promise to invest an extra Â£100m a year to provide seven-day GP cover. 
	Prof Field, the Chief Inspector of GPs for the Care Quality Commission (CQC), said preliminary inspections suggested that up to 200 of the 8,000 practices in England are failing. 
	Problems included: 
	:: Late referrals for patients suspected of suffering from cancer, with potentially fatal consequences 
	:: Wrong medicines being prescribed to patients 
	:: Over-prescription of antibiotics 
	:: Child vaccinations not being stored in fridges, putting hundreds at risk 
	:: Out of date and unhygienic premises 
	:: Staff shortages and ""chaotic management"" 
	Prof Field said that the most severe problems were found in isolated, single doctor practices. ""The writing is on the walls"" for these type of practices, he said. 
	In many of these cases he said the problems had been known about for years, but authorities had not acted. 
	Prof Field's team have been carrying out pilot checks on surgeries for the past year. 
	Last December it was revealed that one such check had found maggots at a surgery in Nottinghamshire. 
	Prof Field said that preliminary results following this process suggested that 2% were failing with large variations in standards of care. 
	He added that when the inspections were first launched almost one third of practices were struggling to achieve all of the basic standards. 
	That number had now dropped to below 20%, he said. 
	Prof Field vowed to act against unsafe surgeries even if politicians protested at the closure of their local practices. 
	""While there is a small number of practices which are very worrying - probably looking at only about 2% - they can affect hundreds or thousands of patients potentially. So this is very serious. 
	""For the small number of practices [providing unsafe care] they will either improve or they will cease to practice. We will remove their registration."" 
	Prof Field said that the 160 to 200 surgeries found to be failing would be given extra support from NHS England to help them improve. 
	""Unfortunately there are some ... which have gone on for years failing and people haven't drawn a line and said enough is enough. For those we will take urgent action. 
	""General Practice is the jewel in our crown and we're undermined by a small percentage of GPs who are not providing the care our patients deserve."" 
	All 8,000 practices in England face inspections from next month and the CQC's findings will be published under a new Ofsted-style regime. 
	Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of BMA GP committee, said: ""We know thatÂ  a lot of GPs are working in an environment that is extremely difficult and challenging, in premises that are not fit for purpose. 
	""And yet they cannot find another place to work in because there are no funds to relocate them. It would not be right to criticise or blame them for factors outside their control."""
2014-09-30,UKIP Defection Timed For Maximum Damage,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20140930145022/http://news.sky.com/story/1343305/ukip-defection-timed-for-maximum-damage,"By Joey Jones, Deputy Political Editor MP Mark Reckless, who has defected from the Conservatives to UKIP, has a good poker face. 
	Ever since Douglas Carswell switched to Nigel Farage's party last month, Mr Reckless has been the name most often mentioned as the next Tory likely to jump ship. 
	He has not shown any outward sign of being tempted. 
	However, it was notable that when he tweeted on Friday explaining his decision not to support military action in Iraq, his tone was notably similar to UKIP leader Mr Farage. 
	""I voted against bombing ISIL in Iraq,"" he tweeted. ""A year ago we were asked to bomb other side in Syria + what good did 557 MPs voting to attack Libya do?"" 
	Even so, his appearance hours later at the UKIP conference in Doncaster is an undeniable coup for the party. 
	And it will dominate the opening of the Tories' own gathering in Birmingham which is just getting under way. 
	While both Mr Carswell and Mr Reckless have been among the more rebellious Tory MPs, party strategists know that neither can be dismissed as mere loose cannons. 
	In effect, UKIP is waging a guerrilla war against its Westminster rivals, and thus far it has been frighteningly effective. 
	The party's ability to time its defections to cause maximum damage, in the full glare of publicity, will be giving Tory strategists nightmares. 
	Labour, too perhaps, given that Mr Farage has vowed to turn his fire on them too. 
	UKIP strategists boast they had Mr Reckless in the bag two months ago. 
	Who would now bet against there being others, similarly ready to be unveiled at the moment of greatest advantage."

	The online trend which involves explicit images of the victim being posted online is on the increase, with schoolgirls among those targeted. 
	Hazel Higgleton was 24 when she discovered a video of her and her ex-boyfriend had been posted on the internet after their relationship broke down. 
	She told Sky News: ""I was with a guy I thought I was in love with and he told me he loved me, and before everything started getting really bad he convinced me to film stuff. 
	""I was a bit hesitant as you would be because it was a new thing and I wasn't sure about it, but I went ahead anyway because I loved him. 
	""I never thought it would get out or anything like that. In fact, I just forgot about the whole video. But then he told me he had put it out there ... It was awful."" 
	Hazel is among those who would like to see a change in the law to ensure people who post pictures without the victim's consent can be brought to justice. 
	Of 149 cases reported since 2012 to the eight police forces in England and Wales who keep data on revenge porn allegations, only six resulted in a police caution or charge. 
	Police are largely powerless to prosecute those responsible, but new laws are currently being debated to make revenge porn a crime. 
	Clare Laxton from Women's Aid told Sky News: ""What is needed is clarification of the law and making sure that frontline services such as police and also women and other people who may be affected are aware that there is a law out there they can use. 
	""I think inevitably with the rise of social media usage and internet usage this is a growing problem."" 
	In response to a Freedom of Information request by the Press Association, Greater Manchester Police revealed the youngest victim it had dealt with was a girl aged 11. 
	In another case in Cambridge a taxi driver blackmailed a passenger into having sex after discovering naked images of her. 
	Although most cases involved young females, a man is also said to have been forced into having gay sex through fear a woman would post naked photos of him online. 
	Concerns around revenge porn and ""sexting"", where compromising pictures are send via text messages, have led some schools to make time for lessons warning pupils of the dangers. 
	At Wright Robinson College in Manchester all Year 11 pupils are taught about issues they might face online. 
	Deputy headteacher Martin Haworth told Sky News: ""The message is always the same - be very clear before you make any type of action in relation to sending messages or posting pictures, things that you do now will affect you in later life."""

	The finding comes after Public Health England carried out the first national survey of the oral health of three-year-olds. 
	The survey found that in some parts of the country as many as a third of kids have bad teeth. 
	Experts examined the teeth of more than 50,000 children at their nursery, children's centre or playgroup during 2012/13. 
	The four regions with the highest levels of tooth decay were the East Midlands, the North West, London and Yorkshire and the Humber. 
	Poor oral hygiene among children was most prevalent in Leicester where the figure was 34% - compared to just 2% in south Gloucestershire. 
:: Take Sky News' quick quiz to test your knowledge of sugary foods. 
	PHE says parents should reduce the amount of sugary foods and drinks they give to their children. 
	They should also make sure they brush their teeth twice a day, including just before bed, with fluoride toothpaste, and only use sugar-free medicines. 
	Sandra White, director of dental public health for PHE, said there have been ""significant improvements"" in the nation's oral health in recent years, although some areas are still experiencing problems. 
	""Thankfully, tooth decay in children can be prevented by following a healthy lifestyle,"" she said. 
	""It is also important to take your child to the dentist ... as the dentist will be able to advise you about how to keep your child's teeth and gums healthy."" 
	Dr Nigel Carter, chief executive of the British Dental Health Foundation, said: ""The stark regional inequalities are a cause for concern.
