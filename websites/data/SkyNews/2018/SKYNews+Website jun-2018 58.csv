2018-06-04,The Labour MP spearheading a cross-party coalition effort to repeal Victorian-era laws criminalising abortion across the UK has told DUP leader Arlene Foster her views shouldn't prevent their bid.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180604010249/https://news.sky.com/story/dup-leader-arlene-foster-warned-over-undemocratic-abortion-stance-11393563,"Stella Creasy, who wants MPs to repeal the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act, which makes abortion a criminal act, suggested Mrs Foster is ""the only woman with any choice over abortion in Northern Ireland"". She also claimed the DUP leader's stance against altering abortion law was preventing the implementation of ""modern, 21st century"" abortion legislation across the whole of the UK. The UK government has come under pressure to review abortion law since an historic referendum in the Republic of Ireland backed overturning a constitutional ban. In 1967, the Abortion Act amended the Victorian-era law to make provision for abortion in the UK, apart from Northern Ireland, where abortion is still illegal in all but the most extreme cases. However, Ms Creasy suggested the 50-year-old legislation applying to England, Scotland and Wales is also now out-of-date and needs replacing This is because it still requires a ""very long process involving two doctors"" for a woman to be permitted an abortion, while women also face having to purchase abortion pills - developed since the 1967 act was written - by themselves online and with a theoretical risk of being prosecuted, Ms Creasy said. The Walthamstow MP told Sky News: ""I don't see why Arlene Foster's views should prevent repeal of legislation that also affects my constituents."" Ms Creasy spoke out after Mrs Foster claimed it was ""quite distasteful"" to see people celebrating the Republic of Ireland referendum result in the street. Mrs Foster also claimed some Sinn Fein supporters have told her they will vote for the DUP because of her party's position on abortion. But, Ms Creasy suggested the DUP leader's views are in contrast to majority opinion in Northern Ireland and that criticising celebrations of the Republic's referendum result ""isn't the best way forward if she wants to be somebody who's seen to be listening to her community"". She said: ""This is about removing a piece of legislation rather than imposing a particular law on Northern Ireland. ""But, they do need to have this debate. The vast majority of the Northern Irish public want a medical rather than a criminal approach to abortion. ""And I think for Arlene Foster to be the only person making a choice on that isn't very democratic at all."" Ms Creasy described how current legislation ""puts abortion in the same category of criminal acts as rape, as child stealing and with blowing somebody up with gunpowder"" in Northern Ireland. She added: ""It is absolutely right that the UK parliament asks, 'do we have modern, 21st century abortion rules?'. ""That it would make an impact for every UK citizen, including those in Northern Ireland, simply makes the case for each nation then being able to describe what a modern abortion law looks like."" Ms Creasy is hoping to use amendments tabled to a forthcoming domestic violence bill to force a vote on the issue at Westminster. Sinn Fein also pushed back against Mrs Foster's claims their supporters could turn to the DUP over the issue of abortion. A spokesman told Sky News: ""The issue of abortion is not a Unionist versus Nationalist issue. ""It affects women from all communities. It is about coming at the issue with compassion and respect, trusting woman and their doctors. ""While there are some with strongly held views, it is not credible to suggest that it will make Republicans become Unionist. ""Just as it would not be credible to suggest that Unionists who support and trust women on this issue will become Republicans. It is simply a wrong that needs put right."""

2018-06-04,"Sajid Javid will take a ""fresh look"" at a cap on the number of foreign doctors as he departed from large parts of Theresa May's legacy in the Home Office.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180604010249/https://news.sky.com/story/javid-pledges-fresh-look-at-foreign-doctors-cap-as-he-discards-pms-policies-11393719,"The home secretary, who was appointed to the post at the end of April, also pledged to review the ""hostile environment"" policy towards illegal immigration and push to remove foreign students from immigration statistics. In addition, Mr Javid notably refused to explicitly back the Conservatives' long-held pledge to reduce yearly net migration to the tens of thousands. The government has recently come under pressure from both Tory MPs and Labour to remove all health workers, amid NHS staff shortages, from the annual cap on the number of skilled workers allowed into the UK, which are limited through so-called Tier Two visas. :: Government facing High Court challenge over 'hostile environment' immigration policy Mr Javid stressed it is ""only in recent months"" that the limit has been reached, but promised action, telling the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""I see the problem with that and it is something that I'm taking a fresh look at. ""I know a number of my colleagues certainly want me to take a look at this, that's exactly what I'm doing."" Mr Javid also used the TV interview to repeat his opposition to the term ""hostile environment"", championed by the prime minister when she was home secretary, with regards to the government's approach towards illegal immigration. The home secretary promised to review aspects of the policy, while branding the term ""hostile"" as ""quite un-British"". He said: ""I've used the word 'compliant' environment and what that means is it's absolutely right that we have an environment in terms of our immigration policy that distinguishes between people that are here legally, and those that are here illegally."" But, Mr Javid admitted, there were ""lessons to be learned"" from the Windrush scandal about how the policy is implemented, as he revealed he has already suspended action that bans illegal immigrants from being able to open bank accounts in the UK. In a further departure from Mrs May's stance towards immigration, the home secretary said there is a ""perception problem"" with including overseas students in immigration statistics and that he understood the argument of those who want them removed from figures. Confessing he empathises with the view it is unwelcoming to those wanting to study in the UK, Mr Javid said: ""It is something I've long considered and it is not my most urgent priority when it comes to immigration right now... but it is something that I would like to look at again."" Despite referring to the Tories' pledge to reduce annual migration to below 100,000 as a ""commitment"" in the party's manifesto, Mr Javid refused to directly support the promise. Responding to the home secretary's comments on foreign health workers, Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ""We don't need a 'fresh look' we need it sorting. ""We have a workforce crisis across the NHS with around 100,000 vacancies. ""Let trusts get on and recruit internationally and stopping blocking medics from coming here to care for our sick."" The Liberal Democrats' home affairs spokesman Sir Ed Davey said: ""The home secretary will have the support of almost everyone in parliament to exclude students and medical staff from the immigration cap, but it's far from clear that the prime minister is willing to admit her long-cherished policy is wrong. ""I hope parliament can get to vote on this as soon as possible."""
2018-06-04,"A woman who opened fire near the finish line of a busy marathon in San Diego has been arrested, police have said.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180604010249/https://news.sky.com/story/shots-fired-near-san-diego-marathon-suspect-in-custody-police-11394077,"US media reported that a woman in her 50s was taken into custody following the incident, which took place in a car park close to the end of the California city's 2018 Rock 'n' Roll San Diego Marathon. She held a gun to her head and fired off rounds before she was taken into custody. There was a heavy law enforcement response near the route, but officials said after the arrest that there was no threat to the community and the race - which attracts thousands annually - was able to get back under way. San Diego Police Department said on Twitter: ""There's no longer a threat to the community. The scene is secure. The Rock and Roll Marathon has resumed."" The Active Shooter at 100 West C St. is in custody. There’s no longer a threat to the community. The scene is secure. The Rock and Roll Marathon has resumed. Several streets had been closed while police responded to the incident, and officials confirmed one officer was injured after accidentally shooting themselves in the leg while pursing the suspect, who had taken aim at police. Marathon organisers said: ""The situation involving an active shooter who was engaged with law enforcement was not related to today's race. ""By 11.45am, the course was shut down and approximately 4,900 athletes were rerouted into a designated safe zone. ""While the race was officially stopped, law enforcement gave the clearance at 11.56am for runners to resume their progress toward the finish line and the post-race finish area, where they were able to meet up with family and friends."" The city's baseball team, the San Diego Padres, said it had also been in ""close contact"" with police following the incident, with a match due to get underway at their Petco Park stadium at 3.10pm local time."
2018-06-04,Sadiq Khan and Theresa May were among the hundreds who gathered for a first anniversary memorial service to honour those killed in the London Bridge attack.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180604010249/https://news.sky.com/story/minutes-silence-for-london-bridge-terror-attack-victims-11393835,"Politicians, emergency service workers and bereaved relatives filled out Southwark Cathedral on Sunday afternoon, with several emotional speeches heard before families of the victims were invited to light candles behind the altar. An olive tree - to be known as the Tree of Healing - was planted in the cathedral grounds using compost from flowers left on the bridge in the aftermath of the murders last year. New tributes were laid on the bridge on Sunday as mourners revisited the scene of the attack, which killed eight people and injured dozens more. Christine Archibald, 30, James McMullan, 32, Alexandre Pigeard, 26, Sebastien Belanger, 36, Ignacio Echeverria, 39, Xavier Thomas, 45, Sara Zelenak, 21, and Kirsty Boden, 28, were those who died. Inside the cathedral, their families were told that they would always be remembered. ""These were people who should have had an amazing life ahead of them,"" said local resident and actor Theo Ancient. ""They had begun to contribute to this world, and to those who loved them they had already brought infinite joy and beauty. They came here to enjoy what this place offers, just as we do, and they will always be mourned here with a fierce kind of tenderness."" Mr Khan also spoke at the service, reading an extract from Psalm 77, after the Dean Andrew Nunn had opened the event by telling those in attendance that he ""hopes it helps our healing"". ""Love is stronger than hate, light is stronger than darkness, life is stronger than death - it was true a year ago, it's as true today,"" he said. The Bishop of Southwark, Rt Revd Christopher Chessun, added: ""The powerful rallying round of the local community has been truly awesome, acknowledging the scars and the trauma, but working for healing and peace, no matter how long that might take and no matter how hard it might be."" At the conclusion of the cathedral service, a procession made its way to the Southwark Needle sculpture on the south side of the bridge, where the prime minister and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn were among those to lay flowers in memory of those who died. Before the service, Mrs May insisted that Britain's resolve against terror has ""never been stronger"". She said the nationalities of the victims - from the UK, Canada, France, Australia and Spain - was ""a reflection of our great cosmopolitan capital"" and ""a tragic reminder that the threat from terrorism transcends borders"". She also praised ""the bravery of our emergency services and those who intervened or came to the aid of others"". Speaking ahead of a minute's silence at the needle, Southwark council leader Cllr Peter John said the attack marked ""one of the darkest days in our borough's history"". ""Time can help us all to heal, but so can the strength and friendship we find in our community at times of adversity,"" he said. ""Today as a borough, a city, a nation, we come together as one community to remember the damage done and demonstrate that we are strong and united in the face of evil."" After the service, Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick told Sky News that she would ""always be proud"" of the response to the attack. ""It's so important to remember not just the awful evil, but also the amazing acts of courage and heroism, of kindness, tenderness and compassion,"" she said. ""I think everybody here was united in wanting to stand with those who have been most affected by what happened."" In a further showing of unity, the hashtag #LondonUnited was projected onto London Bridge on Sunday evening. The event came after senior counter-terror officer Dean Haydon told Sky News there was still a ""very significant security threat"" to the UK."
2018-06-04,"The government is under pressure to release papers outlining a ""Doomsday Brexit"" scenario in which the UK would run short of medicines, food and fuel within two weeks of leaving the EU.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180604010249/https://news.sky.com/story/government-under-pressure-to-publish-warnings-of-doomsday-brexit-11393448,"Whitehall officials are reported to have drawn up three different scenarios for a cross-government group preparing for Britain's departure from the EU. According to the Sunday Times, these include mild and severe scenarios of the UK leaving the bloc without a deal, while a further scenario is known as ""Armageddon"". A source told the newspaper: ""In the second scenario, not even the worst, the port of Dover will collapse on day one. ""The supermarkets in Cornwall and Scotland will run out of food within a couple of days, and hospitals will run out of medicines within two weeks."" They added: ""You would have to medevac medicine into Britain, and at the end of week two we would be running out of petrol as well."" The documents are said to have been written for the Inter-Ministerial Group on Preparedness by civil servants at the Department for Exiting the EU (DExEU), Department of Health and Social Care and Department for Transport. They were leaked by officials concerned by Brexiteers' confidence about the UK's prospects if it left the EU without a deal, the newspaper said. A Whitehall source told Sky News that ""inevitably the government has been discussing a range of scenarios"", adding: ""It's something that's been discussed extensively."" They pointed to how the government have already invested almost £700m in Brexit preparations, with another £3bn made available by the Treasury. The government recently revealed plans to section off a 13-mile stretch of the M20 in Kent, which leads to the port of Dover, to hold around 2,000 lorries in the event of severe cross-Channel congestion. The plan is to be delivered in time for Britain's departure from the EU, although the government denies any direct connection with Brexit. Responding to the reported civil service warnings about a no-deal Brexit, Home Secretary Sajid Javid told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""I'm very confident we'll get a deal, but it's right we look at no deal and all these different scenarios. ""But I don't recognise any of that. From the work that I have seen and the analysis that has been done, those outcomes... I don't think any of them would come to pass."" A DExEU spokesperson rejected the claims as ""completely false"", adding: ""A significant amount of work and decision making has gone into our no deal plans, especially where it relates to ports, and we know that none of this would come to pass."" Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, a prominent Brexiteer, accused civil servants of being ""frozen in the headlights"" about the UK's exit from the EU. ""They should be planning for what happens if there is no deal, not scaring the pants off each other,"" he told the Sunday Times. ""We need people with imagination and courage, not frightened rabbits."" Pro-Remain MPs have demanded the government release details of its considerations of the impact of a no-deal Brexit. Tory backbencher Sarah Wollaston highlighted how the House of Commons health committee, which she chairs, has previously warned of ""serious consequences"" of a no-deal Brexit. She said: ""Why risk everyday essential medical supplies not being on the shelves? We still need to see the evidence of actual vs fantasy contingency planning."" Dr Wollaston described remaining in the EU's single market and ""an effective customs union"" with the bloc as the ""least harmful"" Brexit option. Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, a supporter of the Best for Britain group, who are expected to campaign for a second EU referendum, said: ""The government should publish this document and stop pretending it doesn't exist. ""This drives a stake through any remaining pretence of government competence. This is no joke. Our public services face the prospect of collapse if a 'no deal' Brexit happens. ""We can now see that the government are driving us all towards disaster. What is worse is that they know it too."""

2018-06-04,Gruelling chemotherapy may no longer be required to treat breast cancer following a landmark study. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180604010249/https://news.sky.com/story/chemotherapy-unnecessary-for-thousands-of-women-with-breast-cancer-11393392,"More than 10,000 women with the most common form of early breast cancer took part in a trial that found the treatment was not necessary for many after they had surgery. A leading oncologist said the findings will lead to a ""fundamental change"" in how the disease is treated. It is estimated that 3,000 to 5,000 women in the UK are likely to avoid chemotherapy every year following the trial. Each year more than 20,000 women in the UK are diagnosed with hormone-receptor positive, HER2-negative, node-negative breast cancer. Historically around half of these patients undergo chemotherapy after surgery to remove their tumour to stop the cancer returning The TAILORx trial shows that only 30% of women with this particular form of early-stage breast cancer derive any benefit from the treatment. The study is thought to be the largest breast cancer treatment trial ever carried out. Dr Alistair Ring, consultant medical oncologist at the Royal Marsden NHS Hospital, in London, said: ""I think this is a fundamental change in the way we treat women with early-stage breast cancer and will lead to a considerable number of women no longer needing to have chemotherapy."" The charity Breast Cancer Now said the findings were ""practice-changing"". The TAILORx trial used the Oncotype DX test, currently available on the NHS, which allows doctors to predict the likelihood of the breast cancer coming back. To find out if the cancer could grow or spread, a sample of the tumour is tested after surgery for 21 genetic markers. Patients with a recurrence score of up to 10 out of 100 have been shown not to benefit from chemotherapy and only hormone treatment is required. Patients scoring 26 or higher on the scale do benefit and receive chemotherapy. For those who fall in between - which includes most women - there was no clear evidence on whether they need chemotherapy. The study, led by the Montefiore Medical Centre in New York, found women older than 50 with this form of breast cancer and a score of up to 25 did not need chemotherapy. Patients under 50 with a score of up to 15 also do not need to undergo the treatment, the research concluded. :: Immunotherapy prostate cancer drug gives 'amazing results' Dr Ring said: ""It is a significant step because it is about avoiding a treatment that, for most people diagnosed with cancer, is what they all fear being suggested to have. ""I, as an oncologist on Monday in clinic, will offer less chemotherapy that will not be of benefit to patients and that is very reassuring to know that when I am offering patients chemotherapy they are likely to benefit from it."" Baroness Delyth Morgan, chief executive of Breast Cancer Now, said: ""It's fantastic news that this landmark study could now enable thousands more breast cancer patients over 50 to be safely spared gruelling chemotherapy. ""This is another significant step towards personalised breast cancer treatment and we hope these practice-changing findings will now help refine our use of chemotherapy on the NHS."""
2018-06-04,"Donald Trump's lawyer has claimed the US president ""probably"" has the power to pardon himself from special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180604010249/https://news.sky.com/story/donald-trump-could-pardon-himself-from-robert-muellers-russia-investigation-11394050,"According to Rudy Giuliani, there is nothing in the US Constitution - which gives the sitting president the power to issue pardons - to suggest that Mr Trump could not excuse himself if he wanted to. During an appearance on ABC's This Week programme, Mr Giuliani said the president had ""no intention of pardoning himself"" but ""probably does"" have the power to do so. ""It would be an open question,"" he added. ""I think it would probably get answered by, gosh, that's what the Constitution says. But the reason it won't is because then it becomes a political problem. ""If the president were to pardon himself, he'll get impeached."" The question of whether Mr Trump would pardon himself stemmed from a letter sent by his lawyers to Mr Mueller on 29 January, reported by The New York Times, which contended that the US Constitution gave him the power to ""terminate the inquiry, or even exercise his power to pardon"". But were he to do it, the likely impeachment process would be led by the House of Representatives - and he would then be removed from office by the Senate. Mr Giuliani - a former New York City mayor - also said that the president had not yet decided whether to sit for an interview with Mr Mueller, but that his lawyers were leaning towards advising him not to. Both Mr Trump and Russia have continued to deny any collusion in the run-up to his shock election triumph, with the US leader previously labelling the investigation a ""witch hunt"". He has also denied attempting to disrupt it, but has not been shy of issuing sharp criticisms of the process via Twitter. The investigation led by Mr Mueller - previously appointed FBI director by former president George W Bush - has already led to criminal charges against Trump campaign aides, including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort."

German media said police were called to the Berliner Dom, a major tourist attraction on the historic Museum Island, after a dispute between two people there. The Tagesspiegel newspaper said two people had been injured - the suspect and a man he had attacked. Police said in a tweet: ""Shortly after 4pm (2pm GMT) police shot at a rampaging man at Berlin cathedral. He was wounded in the leg."" A spokesman wrote in a tweet: ""There are no indications that the motive was terrorism- or Islamist-related."" He later said the man, whose threatening behaviour led police to shoot him in the leg, was a 53-year-old Austrian who had been wielding a knife and was ""verbally aggressive"". One policeman was injured, police said, but details of how the injuries were sustained are not confirmed. It is not known whether anyone else was hurt in the incident at Berlin's main Protestant cathedral. Some 100 people were at the Dom at the time of the incident. The iron-domed house of worship is east of Berlin's main Unter den Linden boulevard and close to the Alexanderplatz shopping district. The DPA news agency reported that some witnesses had been traumatised and were taken away for psychological counselling. The incident came amid a state of high alert in the country over the risk of terror attacks. In the worst jihadist attack in the country to date, Tunisian asylum seeker Anis Amri rammed a truck into crowds at a Berlin Christmas market in December 2016, killing 12 people."

One of the tins was found in a collection belonging to Leicestershire Regiment soldier Richard Bullimore. Only one of the 10 bars was eaten and the tin is now to be sold at an antiques auction organised by Scunthorpe-based auctioneers Eddisons CJM. The company's Paul Cooper said: ""The tin was made by Barringer Wallis & Manners of Mansfield, one of the world's leading manufacturers of decorative tinwear. ""The colonies chocolate was sent to troops in that first winter of the war. Trinidad, Grenada and St Lucia provided the cocoa. Cadburys made the chocolate bars. ""Even the container is rare but to find the chocolate still inside is just unreal."" He said the chocolate looked in good shape, ""although I have to admit that I wouldn't be tempted to give it a go, even if the experts say that chocolate seldom becomes really dangerous over time but it does lose its flavour and texture."" Richard Bullimore was also given a Princess may tobacco box containing cigarettes, tobacco and matches. Mr Cooper said: ""Almost all the contents of that are still there. Just three cigarettes are missing."" The main reason the chocolate and cigarettes were never consumed was because Cpl Bullimore was a didn't like chocolate and was a non-smoker. He received a number of medals for his service, including the Distinguished Conduct Medal for conspicuous gallantry during a clash in no-man's land between the trenches in Ypres in July 1915. By then he was a corporal and led a reconnaissance patrol of five men that surprised a larger enemy force. Even though they were outnumbered by more than three to one, the patrol attacked with grenades, inflicting a number of casualties. He then covered his patrol as it withdrew and carried one of his men who had been wounded back to the trenches. Cpl Bullimore left military service and in 1919 he went back to the Leicestershire Constabulary which he had joined just weeks before war broke out and rose to the rank of superintendent. He died in January 1967 at the Barrow Haven Inn, North Lincolnshire where his son was the licensee. The entire Bullimore collection, which as well as chocolate and cigarettes, includes medals, citations, letters and other items, will go under the hammer on Tuesday."

Assistant Chief Constable Stephen Martin said: ""The PSNI has a responsibility to keep people safe and we constantly review our resources to ensure that we are best equipped to do this. ""In light of the UK Referendum vote to leave the EU, we are reviewing decisions we previously made about our stations identified for disposal. ""Accordingly, it is our intention to pause the disposal of three stations in border areas, namely Warrenpoint, Castlederg and Aughnacloy. :: Northern Ireland must have same status as UK after Brexit, says DUP leader Arlene Foster ""As the PSNI has not yet received details regarding potential border arrangements, this is a precautionary step to ensure that, whatever Brexit look like in the future, we will be able to continue to keep our communities safe,"" he added. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK to share a land boundary with another EU member state - the Republic of Ireland. Theresa May's commitment to avoiding physical infrastructure at the border is difficult to square with her government's determination to leave the Customs Union and Single Market. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has said there needs to be a deal on the issue at the EU Summit this month if there is to be progress on a withdrawal agreement. SDLP Brexit spokesperson Claire Hanna MLA said the postponement suggested ""a willingness by some to accept a hard border"". ""The British government continually say that there will be no hard border in Ireland but they have failed time and time again to put a comprehensive plan on the table and this is the outcome of that indecisiveness. ""Any hardening of the border would be a deliberate violation of our political process by the British government. ""Brexit is a real threat to our way of life. Any suggestion of any border here must be resisted. The socio-economic and the political consequences of a border across Ireland are catastrophic. ""Time is up for the British government. We can no longer wait on their pandering to hard Brexiteers. They must bring a solution urgently to ensure our way of life and the peace process is protected,"" she added."
2018-06-04,Home Secretary Sajid Javid sparked a row with the Muslim Council of Britain after he rejected their call for an independent inquiry into allegations of Islamophobia within the Conservative Party.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180604010249/https://news.sky.com/story/sajid-javid-in-muslim-council-of-britain-spat-over-islamophobia-claims-11393750,"Demanding action from Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis last week, the council said the last month it had seen weekly incidents of Islamophobia from Conservative representatives and candidates. Former Tory chair Baroness Warsi backed up the claims and suggested there is a ""simmering anti-Muslim underbelly of Islamophobia within the party"". However, Mr Javid, appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, dismissed the Conservative peer's comments, as he pointed to his Muslim background. He said: ""For a start, let's just look at who the home secretary is in this country. My name is Sajid Javid, I'm the home secretary."" Mr Javid also dismissed the demand for an investigation, adding: ""The Muslim Council of Britain does not represent Muslims in this country. You find me a group of Muslims that thinks they're represented by the MCB. ""I would be very suspicious of anything that they've got to say not least because, under the last Labour government - and a policy continued by us - we don't deal with the MCB. ""We don't deal with it because too many of their members have had favourable comments on extremists and that's not acceptable."" In response, Harun Khan, the MCB's secretary general, claimed Mr Javid had ""chosen to shoot the messenger"" rather than address their ""serious concerns"". Suggesting Mr Javid had attempted to ""smear"" his group, Mr Khan said: ""We have identified real weekly cases of Islamophobia in the Conservative Party, which the party has even acknowledged by suspending members. ""These real concerns of Islamophobia are shared by two Conservative Muslim peers, as well as voices across the spectrum, many of them Conservatives. ""If the response is to instead attack the Muslim Council of Britain, it sadly indicates that the party has no interest in dealing with this matter with the seriousness it deserves. ""We have long spoken out and proactively challenged terrorism and extremism, as have British Muslims across the country. ""The reality of Islamophobia is that Muslims and the Muslim Council of Britain have to deal with the smear of extremism even though they have clearly and consistently condemned violence perpetrated by people who claim to do this in the name of our religion."""
2018-06-10,"Sir Christopher Chope may not be on Twitter, but the 71-year-old Conservative MP's name was trending on Friday night after he decided to single-handedly block a bill to make upskirting a criminal offence.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180617004932/https://news.sky.com/story/tory-dinosaur-damages-party-image-as-mp-blocks-upskirting-bill-11406719,"But it was not just social media that went into meltdown over his actions - the Conservative Party was in a tailspin, too. Sir Christopher's colleagues knew all too well the damage this would do. ""Don't underestimate just how furious many Tory MPs are about this,"" tweeted Paul Masterton, a new MP who is 39 years Sir Christopher's junior. ""This kind of thing does far more damage to the public's view of our party than endless debates about customs arrangements."" Beyond SW1, people do not care - or even understand - much about the ins and outs of Brexit policy, but they do understand - and care about - social issues that perhaps touch their lives or speak to the kind of society they live in. That is why Tories' missteps on dementia, fox hunting and ivory trade hurt them in the 2017 election and why this furore over upskirting is so worrying for them now. The bill called for taking photos up somebody's skirt without permission to be made illegal. MPs have publicly and privately sidelined Sir Chris as a politician of yesteryear. He's a ""dinosaur"" from a ""different century"" who has ""stayed too long"" on the Tory benches. They are telling him to apologise, some are even muttering that the prime minister should withdraw the whip. In his defence, his objection to the Private Member's Bill on upskirting was not a defence of the practice itself - there are reports that Sir Chris does not even know what it is - but rather an objection in principle to the use of Private Members' Bills to pass laws. Sir Chris has made it his life's work to block these bills on the basis that opposition parties should not be able to write government laws. Of course this is the sort of arcane debate over parliamentary procedure that means little to women - and men - furious that upskirting has not been made a criminal offence. They do not see an MP arguing a point of procedural principle; what they see a 71-year-old man allowing this awful crime to go on unchecked and a Tory Party that is out-of-touch with modern Britain. The prime minister, her ministers and MPs have scrambled to contain the fallout and will certainly push through legislation to ban upskirting in the coming weeks. But in a social media age, she will know that the damage has almost certainly now been done. Perhaps it is time to retire the dinosaurs."
2018-06-10,"It will not feel like it to the 4,600 employees with whom Rolls-Royce is about to part company, but the company's major restructuring could mark a turning point in the fortunes of one of the UK's premier engineering firms.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180617004932/https://news.sky.com/story/rolls-royce-job-cuts-could-mark-turning-point-in-engineering-firms-fortunes-11404880,"There is no point in having some of the best technology in the world if you do not have a world class business to support it. There is no point in employing some of the world's best engineers if your balance sheet is so stretched that you are unable to back them with investment. That is the backdrop to Thursday's announcement. One grouse commonly heard in every workplace in the land is that there are too many bosses and not enough workers. Warren East, who became chief executive of Rolls three years ago after 12 years at the helm of acclaimed chip designer ARM Holdings, has reached that conclusion. He believes that, even after four years of extensive restructurings, the company has too many managers and that there is too much duplication of roles across the business. The history of British business, especially manufacturing, is littered with examples of companies that ultimately went under because generations of previous executives had shied away from making tough decisions. Mr East is determined Rolls-Royce will not be one of those companies in the future. Rolls insiders say the cuts he has announced could and should have been made by his predecessors. That does not mean to say Mr East is some emotionless cost-cutter. Far from it. Discussing Thursday's announcement, it was abundantly clear that this has been a painful decision and that Mr East is deeply unhappy about losing so many employees, particularly in Derby. The aircraft engine maker has been in the city for more than a century and, as Mr East noted, some of those losing their jobs as a result of this restructuring will be the second or third generation of their family to have worked for the company. He keenly feels the sense of social responsibility the company has to the city. Critics of the company might also note the sensitivity with which the announcement has been handled. Many employees of listed companies only learn of impending job cuts via a 7am announcement on the London Stock Exchange. Mr East, who will update the City on future investment plans and expected financial returns on Friday, could just as easily have waited until then to announce these job losses. Instead, he insisted the matters were dealt with separately: ""Today, we talk with our people. Tomorrow, we talk to the City."" Not that this has satisfied Chris Williamson, the Corbynite Labour MP for Derby North, who grumbled that the announcement represented a ""failure of shareholder capitalism"" while reminiscing fondly about the numbers employed by Rolls when he left school in Derby in 1972. That year, of course, Rolls was in public ownership and its millions of pounds of losses were back-stopped by taxpayers. Is that seriously the business model Mr Williamson would see restored to Rolls? That Rolls should be nationalised as it was in the 1970s and be forced to fund investment by putting out a begging bowl to Whitehall mandarins? That it should compete with the likes of the NHS for scarce government funding? It is hard to think of an outcome more likely to jeopardise the company's very future. What Mr East has announced is no different from similar restructurings at some of Rolls's leading competitors, GE and Pratt & Whitney, both of which have laid off thousands of workers at various points during the last decade. Mr Williamson also made the extraordinary claim on Thursday that jobs were being sacrificed ""on the altar of higher shareholder dividends"". Clearly he is not a shareholder in the company himself or he would have noticed that one of the first things Mr East did on becoming chief executive was to announce Rolls's first dividend cut in 23 years. He may not also have noticed that Rolls has invested some £11bn since 2010 on research and development and new facilities. That hardly smacks of a company that puts short-term profits and dividends ahead of creating a long-term, sustainable business, one whose aircraft engines now powers more than half of the world's wide-body passenger jets, compared with less than one in four only a decade ago. For the employees who stay at Rolls, the engineers on the shop floor, this could be a liberating movement. The restructuring is, in Mr East's words, all about empowering them to make decisions more quickly in a leaner organisation. Most employees complain, at some point in their working lives, about the slow speed at which decisions are made in their place of work. When the obstacles that prevent speedier decision-making are removed, it can be liberating. That is what Mr East is aiming to achieve at Rolls-Royce."

The 30-year-old Irish actress, who plays Clare in TV series Derry Girls, also pointed out that this is the second time Mr Fisher has commented on her weight in a review for the British Theatre Guide. Can't wait to take the stage tonight for #MissJeanBrodie with the leggy Angus @anguswright, the shapely Ed MacLiam, and the curvy @kittheyounger ;) In a review last August of Jess And Joe Forever, in which she played Jess, Coughlan claimed that he started the review with ""Jess is a fat girl"". She tweeted: ""My weight has no relevance to either the performance I gave in that or in The Prime Of Miss Jean Brodie."" I’m shocked you got this. Excellent work on calling it out. Don’t think I’ve *ever* seen a Theatre review mentioning a man’s body in this way. xxx Coughlan questioned how the publication could continue to support his fat-shaming, and said Mr Fisher is ""not welcome to review any show I am in from now till forever. And I plan to be in a lot of damn shows"". She also asked Mr Fisher if she could ""cruelly review"" his body and post it online. The British Theatre Guide has apologised to Coughlan, saying the ""offending words have been removed"". ""While the reviewer may not have intended to offend, he accepts that it is not acceptable to use such descriptions in a review and not BTG policy,"" it said. You’re incredible in this production. Ace response to that reviewer! Coughlan called it ""a bit of a tepid apology"" but said she will accept it if they ""never review another woman's body again"". She said Mr Fisher has offered to apologise to her directly but she declined. Thousands of people have supported Coughlan in publicly calling out Mr Fisher. Oh Quentin, just you try me pal #TimesUp https://t.co/NzLgHSULoG However, parliamentary sketch writer and theatre reviewer Quentin Letts agreed with him, saying Mr Fisher made ""perfectly reasonable comments about the weight of a character in Miss Jean Brodie"".

The bill, which was proposed by Liberal Democrat MP Wera Hobhouse and supported by ministers, was expected to get the nod through the Commons on Friday. After it was blocked, Theresa May said: ""Upskirting is an invasion of privacy which leaves victims feeling degraded and distressed. ""I am disappointed the bill didn't make progress in the Commons today, and I want to see these measures pass through Parliament - with government support - soon."" :: Who is the MP who blocked the upskirting law? One minister told Sky News that No 10 was going to ""get upskirting sorted"" and said they hoped the government would get the legislation passed before the house rises for Summer recess in mid-July. ""We're not having this unpicked by one maverick who stayed too long."" A government source said ministers had a number of options to get the upskirting laws on the statue book. No 10 could push it through in a number of ways from tabling its own bill to pushing it through as a backbench bill with government support. ""The message from government is clear: we will do what it takes to get this measure to debate and through its Commons stages as quickly as possible."" Blocking its progress only requires one MP to shout ""object"" when the title of a private member's bill is read out. Sir Christopher is on the libertarian right of Conservative Party and is understood to regard many private members' bills as politically correct expressions of the nanny state. Minister for women Victoria Atkins and Tory MP Will Quince were among those who cried ""shame"" after his intervention. Why MP objected to making upskirting a criminal offence The bill will be debated next on 6 July, but will only take one dissenting voice to put another stop to its progress. Ms Hobhouse told Sky News it was a ""petty thing to do"". ""I think it's very frustrating and annoying that one MP can block a consensus that had been built over several months,"" she said. ""It's really annoying we couldn't make progress."" She added that ""every month matters"", pointing out festival season was approaching. Dawn Butler, Labour's shadow minister for women and equalities, said: ""It's absolutely disgusting that a male Tory MP has blocked upskirting from becoming a criminal offence.

Upskirting victim Gina Martin, 26, launched the campaign after two men took a picture up her skirt while at a festival in 2017. In a statement, Ms Martin admitted she knew Sir Christopher's scepticism was a ""risk"" but that ""I'm positive and hopeful that he will become a supporter"". Reacting to Sir Christoper scuppering the bill, justice minister Lucy Frazer said the government ""has every expectation"" upskirting will eventually become a criminal offence. Do not underestimate just how furious many Tory MPs are about this. This kind of thing does far more damage to the public's view of our party than endless debates about customs arrangements https://t.co/1SCVsAo7ua A government spokesman echoed this, saying: ""Whilst we are disappointed this Bill did not pass second reading today, we look forward to supporting these measures through the House at the earliest possible opportunity."" Victims of upskirting have been found to be as young as 10 years old. Currently, victims in England and Wales are forced to seek prosecution through other legal avenues, such as outraging public decency or harassment. A specific law against upskirting already exists in Scotland."

It is the first step towards a fully autonomous machine that could whisk passengers through city traffic far more safely. Engineer Torquil Ross-Martin has set up a company, AutoRd Limited, to develop the bike. He said the on-board computer reacts far more quickly than a brain to dangerous situations, such as a gust of wind or an obstruction. ""A computer can do a better job than a human can because it is always concentrating. ""When commuting you are not necessarily completely focussed on what you are doing. ""You are thinking about what you are going to do when you get to the office or whether you are running late. ""That's where the bike will improve the safety for commuters."" Sensors on the bike can detect the direction and speed of movement so the computer can tell if it is falling to one side. Small corrections in the automatic steering instantly re-balance the bike. I was the first journalist to be allowed to ride as a passenger. The bike swayed from side to side - a little unnervingly - until it picked up speed. But the rest of the route was smooth. By the time we tilted to one side to turn around I was confident that I wouldn't need the 'kill switch' that I had my finger on. It was a remarkable - if slightly eerie - insight to a future in which autonomous bikes are the ultimate urban taxi. But for now the prototype is being used in conjunction with AB Dynamics to test how autonomous cars react to motorbikes. Currently checks are done with soft targets, such as foam cut-outs, because the risk to a human rider would be too great. Richard Simpson, a control systems engineer for the company, said the technology needs far more vigorous testing to keep other road-users safe. ""Motorbikes are really agile and often faster than cars,"" he said. ""They can weave in and out of traffic and accelerate really hard. ""Soft targets have a different radar signature, so that's why you need to use a motorcycle for realistic testing."" The bike needs to be fitted with LIDAR laser equipment - already used on autonomous cars to detect objects - before it is road-ready. It will need extensive development work and AutoRd is looking for a commercial partner."
2018-06-10,A landmark ruling banning five drill musicians from encouraging violence in their rap videos has been criticised by freedom of speech campaigners. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180617004932/https://news.sky.com/story/drill-musicians-ban-criticised-by-free-speech-campaigners-11406187,"The members of the 1011 group received criminal behaviour orders (CBOs) on Friday that will also force them to warn police before they record or perform songs for three years. The Metropolitan Police is cracking down on drill videos because they glamourise violent crime. The term drill is slang for automatic weapons, and drill videos typically feature masked gangs talking about guns, drugs and violence. Scotland Yard blamed the sub-genre of rap or an increase in violence in the capital. But the drill musicians themselves, along with their fans, argue they are just portraying the realities of their lives. Judge Ann Mulligan, sitting at Kingston Crown Court, made the CBOs against Yonas Girma, 21, Micah Bedeau, 19, Isaac Marshall, 18, Jordan Bedeau, 17, and Rhys Herbert, 17, after they were locked up for conspiracy to commit violent disorder. But a legal director at Open Rights Group, an organisation that defends digital rights and freedoms, has slammed the ruling, saying it is ""extraordinarily concerning"". Myles Jackman said: ""There has been restrictions put in place on language on the basis that it may incite further criminality - we are getting into the territory of thought crime."" The head of Index on Censorship, a publishing organisation for freedom of expression, said violence needs to be tackled, ""not ideas and opinions"". Chief executive Jodie Ginsberg said: ""This isn't going to address the issues that lead to the creation of this kind of music, nor should we be creating a precedent in which certain forms of art which include violent images or ideas are banned,"" she added. The Metropolitan Police warned the orders would be increasingly sought and the head of anti-gang unit Trident defended them as necessary for music that inflames violence. Detective chief superintendent Kevin Southworth said: ""We're not in the business of killing anyone's fun, we're not in the business of killing anyone's artistic expression - we are in the business of stopping people being killed. ""This isn't about us straying into the area of regulation or censorship."" Last month, YouTube removed more than half of the music videos the Met asked to be deleted because they promote violence. Girma, of Hanworth; Marshall, of Ladbroke Grove; Herbert, and brothers Jordan and Micah Bedeau, of Notting Hill, are serving jail or detention sentences for between 10 months and three-and-a-half years. There has been a sharp rise in violent deaths in London, including several stabbings, in 2018."

It was made aware of allegations that some of its aid workers used sex workers while they were working in the relief effort there. Oxfam has told staff it needs to urgently find £16m of savings and reduce the number of its aid projects as it copes with the fallout from the scandal, according to an internal document obtained by The Guardian. An Oxfam spokeswoman did not comment on the document, which was circulated among the charity's staff last week by its outgoing head, Mark Goldring, according to the newspaper. She said the charity was cutting head office and support functions to ensure it could maintain most of its on-the-ground aid programmes, such as helping Rohingya refugees in camps in Bangladesh and people struggling to survive conflict in Yemen. :: Oxfam UK chief quits over Haiti sex scandal ""We are devastated that the appalling behaviour of some former staff in Haiti and shortcomings in how we dealt with that eight years ago means we now have less money to provide clean water, food and other support to people who need it,"" she said.

Dich will spend a further five years on licence. A third member, Safaa Boular, 18, is to be sentenced at a later date. A fourth person, Khawla Barghouthi, who was a friend of Rizlaine, faces jail for not alerting authorities to the plot. Boular planned to stab random members of the public around the Palace of Westminster to cause widespread panic, injury and death, the Old Bailey heard. She had taken the idea from her younger sister Safaa, who was in custody over an attempt to become a jihadi bride in Syria. The sisters spoke of an Alice in Wonderland themed tea party in coded phone calls, with the elder sister cast as the Mad Hatter. Boular, 22, pleaded guilty to preparing acts of terrorism. Her mother, Dich, 44, admitted helping her, and was jailed for nearly seven years. Judge Mark Dennis said Dich ""failed in her parental role"" to step in and stop the attack, and said she played a ""significant role"" in the radicalisation of both of her daughters. He told the elder Boular she planned a ""wicked act"". He added: ""There are individuals walking the streets today whose lives could have been irreparably damaged or lost had it not been for the intervention of the police and security services."" The pair did not react as they were sentenced. The court heard that Rizlaine and Safaa discussed the plot with Dich, before Rizlaine and Dich went shopping for knives and a rucksack. Rizlaine practised the attack in a bugged conversation at friend Barghouthi's home, as the pair laughed about whether she might ""flop so badly"" and cut her arm by accident. When Rizlaine was arrested, she shouted ""f*** you* at police. She was shot in the stomach three times by an officer who thought she had something in her hand. In mitigation, her lawyer Imran Khan said: ""In short, Rizlaine Boular embarked on this course of conduct because she wanted to die. ""She knew as soon as she produced a knife in the vicinity of the Palace of Westminster police officers would swoop and kill her and that's what she wanted at that time."" Mr Khan added that she had been radicalised online after being sacked from a job in marketing because she wore Muslim clothes, and she had suffered an abusive marriage to a local imam. But he said she had put her past views behind her. Being shot on arrest was a ""constant reminder"" he said, of what had happened, and ""the fact she realised when she was shot she did not want to die"". In mitigation for her mother, Dich, Keiran Vaughan said she played a ""lesser role"" in the plan. Barghouthi's lawyer said the 21-year-old did not realise how serious the defendant had been to carry out the attack, and said she had been shocked to listen again to the recordings of their conversations. She will be sentenced next Friday, and Safaa Boular will be sentenced at a later date."

The inferno, which rapidly took hold, comes four years after the property, hailed as an architectural masterpiece, was badly damaged in another fire. The building had been undergoing a multimillion-pound restoration programme, which had been due to be completed next year. Fire crews say the damage caused in the 2014 blaze was considerably less than that suffered in the latest disaster. Visiting the site, Scotland's first minister told reporters: ""It is heartbreaking."" She said her government was ""ready to do anything we reasonably can"" in the wake of the blaze. Ms Sturgeon said it was too early to draw conclusions on what may have caused the fire as she hailed the efforts of emergency workers at the scene. Scottish Fire and Rescue Service deputy assistant chief officer Peter Heath said the building had been ""extensively damaged by fire"" that had ""spread very rapidly"". Crews called to the building in the city centre at about 11.20pm on Friday and were met with ""extremely difficult conditions"", he said. At its height, more than 120 firefighters were battling the flames. ""This fire has consumed this building,"" said Mr Heath. The blaze was a ""devastating loss for Glasgow"", with firefighters dealing with a ""sense of loss"" along with the city's people, he said. Architectural historian Neil Baxter told Sky News the building was of global importance, having influenced architecture around the world since its creation in the 19th century by Charles Rennie Mackintosh. ""It's just tragic,"" he said. Former students at the art school spoke of their shock and sadness. Graduate Margaret Archbold, 48, said she had come to the cordon surounding the building to ""say goodbye"". She said: ""It just keeps getting kicked in the teeth. It shouldn't have happened again. ""It was graduation day yesterday for this year's students. I just feel really sorry for the fire brigade because they worked so hard to save it the last time."" Sam Patterson, 30, vice president of the Glasgow Institute of Architects, who studied at the art school, said there was a sense of ""disbelief"". Mr Patterson said: ""It's a shocker, especially in Mackintosh's 150th anniversary and so close to being completed."" Stuart Robertson, director of the Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society, said the fire was ""terrible"" and a ""massive body blow"" and would be ""sending shockwaves around the world"". He said: ""This is a world class building. With all the restoration work going on it's just horrendous, I can't really believe it. ""I've only seen glimpses, and what the firemen are saying, reading between the lines it looks bad. The last time they stopped it going into the east wing this time it looks as though it's gone from the east wing all the way through. ""To see some of the work and the beautiful craftsmanship that's gone on and I'd seen a glimpse of the new library taking shape and the studio work and all the painstaking work that's gone into the restoration is just... people must feel sick."" Alan Dunlop, professor of architecture at the art school, said he was ""devastated"". He said: ""It's horrible. The building does look as though from the inside it's been totally gutted. All that seems to remain is the stone walls on the outside. ""The deeply sad thing is that yesterday was graduation day. So the students will have felt elated and very happy, and then to wake up the next morning they will be very sad indeed."" Hollywod star Brad Pitt and Dr Who actor Peter Capaldi were among those lending their support to the restoration project, which was set to cost up to £35m."

Ms Ryan told Sky News: ""He came through the door, he was bouncy and really happy it was his last day at school. ""I looked at the back of his shirt and underneath the neck area it had the N-word written on it. ""It had coon written on it twice and then it had 'go back to the jungle' written on it. ""He was distraught, he's traumatised. ""I was quite upset because it's racial hatred, it's racial discrimination, it's against the law."" Ms Ryan, who is chief executive of equalities charity Working Action Group, said she was so upset she was crying, but she pulled herself together for a meeting with the headteacher. He was ""sincerely apologetic and said he was going to take it very seriously"". She added that her son had suffered from racism before at the school but she felt those incidents were not taken ""as seriously as I thought they should have been"". ""I don't think they were dealing with the undercurrent and overt racism my son suffered from for almost three years,"" she said. ""We feel like it's going back in time, I faced severe racism when I was at school, also in Essex, and its affected me in more ways than one."" With tears falling down her face, she said: ""Racism needs to be eradicated and it's not fair on my son. It hurts so much."" Ms Ryan says she has reported the incident to the police, who have recorded it as a hate crime. Sky News has contacted the school for a comment."

The bloated snake was found close to the victim's belongings, including her sandals and a flashlight. The villagers cut open the 23ft-long creature and found Ms Tiba's body was intact after she had been swallowed head first. The village's chief, known as Faris, said: ""When they cut open the snake's belly they found Tiba's body still intact with all her clothes."" A man suffered seizures after the severed head of a rattlesnake bit him. A police spokesman added: ""Residents were suspicious the snake swallowed the victim, so they killed it, then carried it out of the garden. ""The snake's belly was cut open and the body of the victim was found inside."" The garden was at the base of a rocky cliff and known to be home to snakes, the spokesman said. Giant pythons, which regularly top 5.7m (19ft) , are commonly found in Indonesia and the Philippines. While the snakes have been known to attack small animals, attempts to eat people are rare. In March last year, a farmer was killed by a python in the village of Salubiro on Sulawesi island."
2018-06-10,A teenager managed to escape any major injuries after falling 24m (80ft) down a blowhole in Cornwall.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180617004932/https://news.sky.com/story/teen-rescued-after-falling-80ft-down-blowhole-in-cornwall-11406989,"A number of rescuers were lowered into the hole in between Trevone Bay and Harlyn Bay near Padstow just before 1am on Saturday to save the 16-year-old. Newquay Coastguard called it a ""complex cliff rescue"" as teams battled for about three-and-a-half hours through the night to rescue the boy. They believe he had been celebrating the end of exams when he fell down the blowhole. The holes, of which there are several along Cornwall's coast, are formed when a vertical fault in a cliff is widened by waves, allowing water pressure to escapes up through the hole. Padstow Coastguard was initially sent to the wrong blowhole and called for assistance as the crew travelled to the other side of the bay to the correct one. They lowered their ""cliff man"" down the hole with an Air Ambulance paramedic who stabilised the boy and placed him on a stretcher. A second cliff technician from Newquay Coastguard was then sent down and between them they decided it was safer to haul the boy up the hole instead of through the bottom to where a Padstow lifeboat crew was waiting in a boat. The coastguard helicopter, Rescue 924, then airlifted the boy to Royal Cornwall Hospital Treliske before the paramedic and first cliff technician were pulled up the cliff. Writing on Facebook, Padstow Coastguard, said: ""Excellent multi agency team work as always with a great result."" Newquay Coastguard added: ""The male was extremely lucky and believed not life threatening injuries [sic]. Fantastic teamwork."" Padstow and the surrounding coastline is popular with holidaymakers, with many British teenagers heading to the area to celebrate the end of exams. In April a 56-year-old walker suffered serious injuries to his head and back after falling 6m (20ft) down Round Hole at Trevone, the famous collapsed sea cave near Padstow. The man was rescued after his friends raised the alarm, with one staying with him before rescuers winched him out with a helicopter."
2018-06-10,Two teenage moped thieves have been jailed for more than 20 years each after stabbing a charity worker to death.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180617004932/https://news.sky.com/story/teen-moped-riders-jailed-over-youth-workers-murder-11405596,"Nathan Gilmaney, 19, and Troy Thomas, 18, killed youth worker Abdul Samad for his iPhone as they swept across London in a spree of ""aggression and blood lust"", the Old Bailey heard. The teenagers robbed a total of nine people, stabbing four of them, in a matter of hours. They were dubbed ""highwaymen of the 21st century"" by prosecutors. The pair continued to search for victims as Mr Samad collapsed on his doorstep in front of his horrified parents. CCTV footage shows the teenagers, on a moped with the plates removed, pursuing a clearly terrified pedestrian through an empty west London street later in the evening. It is understood that Gilmaney stabbed his victim in the chest in an attempt to take the PIN code for his phone. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum of 27 years, while Thomas was sentenced to a minimum of 22 years. Judge Richard Marks QC described 28-year-old Mr Samad as an ""outstanding"" young man, engaged to be married and ""with his whole life ahead of him"". ""Your wicked stabbing of him has left his family understandably utterly devastated,"" he said. Mr Samad's girlfriend, Sultana Ahmed, described him as the ""change we needed to see in the world"" and said the last thing he said to her was: ""This year will be our year and we will be a family"". His mother Layla Begum said the family had been ""broken"" by the murder, on 16 October last year. ""Since his death there has not been a single moment that goes by for me without shedding tears,"" she said. Detective Inspector Shaun Fitzgerald said the teenagers could hear Mr Samad's cries and the paramedics giving him surgery in the street, but sped off on Gilmaney's scooter to continue their spree. They were caught by police officers on the same night. ""The teenagers believed they had the right to threaten and rob wherever they wanted, often stabbing their victims for no reason at all but to prove they could,"" DI Fitzgerald said."
2018-06-10,"Sir Christopher Chope and Philip Davies, who between them have used disruptive tactics on two new private members' bills, loathe many backbench bids to reform the law and see it their moral crusade to challenge them.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180617004932/https://news.sky.com/story/why-mp-sir-christopher-chope-objected-to-making-upskirting-a-criminal-offence-11406015,"Two of the most prominent figures on the libertarian Right of the Conservative Party, the pair regard many private members' bills as politically correct, nanny state nonsense seeking to meddle in people's lives and curb their personal freedom. In their latest challenge, first Mr Davies made a 148-minute speech on a Labour MP's bill to tackle the use of force against mental health patients. Then, Sir Christopher blocked a Lib Dem MP's bill to make ""upskirting"" a criminal offence by objecting to it. It only needs one MP to shout ""object"" to halt the progress of a fairly uncontentious private members' bill which had been expected to go through ""on the nod"". The result is that it goes to the back of the queue for private members' bills. And so that is now the fate of Lib Dem MP Wera Hobhouse's Voyeurism (Offences) Bill, which has government backing and proposes making it illegal for offenders to take a picture under someone's clothing without their consent. Sir Christopher, 71, is described by The Times Guide to the House of Commons as an ""abrasive carrier of the Thatcherite flame"". He's a climate change sceptic, once referred to Commons staff as ""servants"" and voted against same-sex marriage. MP for Christchurch, where a third of the residents are over 65, he is a former chairman of the Thatcherite campaign group, Conservative Way Forward, at whose dinner last week Boris Johnson made his notorious ""let Donald Trump negotiate Brexit"" speech. Sir Christopher was still on his feet in the Commons when the debate on Labour MP Steve Reed's Mental Health Units (Use of Force) Bill ran out of time at 2.30pm, which meant it had been ""talked out"" out and prevented from progressing. Seconds later, when Deputy Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle named Ms Hobhouse's bill, which most MPs expected to be approved without a vote, Sir Christopher shouted ""Object!"", prompting shouts of ""Shame!"" from MPs on both sides of the Commons. Mr Reed's bill toughens the law on restraining mental patients and also requires police to wear body cameras while carrying out restraint, unless there are legitimate operational reasons for not doing so. In recent years, Sir Christopher has objected to numerous private members' bills, including: :: Safeguarding wild animals in circuses:: Protecting police dogs from being stabbed:: National standards for taxi licences:: Banning fraudulent wearing of medals:: Giving 6th formers better career advice Before Mr Chope spoke, Shipley MP Mr Davies, 46, spoke for nearly two-and-a-half hours, in what some MPs saw as a deliberate filibuster, even though Commons rules dictate that this is un-parliamentary. As Mr Davies's speech hit the two-hour mark, the Liberal Democrat former health minister Normand Lamb said: ""I have a very real concern - and I don't think it's his intention, but I hope it isn't - that we could end up this being talked out today, and the risk then that this bill is lost."" When I spoke after the debate to Mr Davies, whose long speech meant there was only nine minutes for the Bill's third reading, he insisted he was not attempting to block the mental health bill but trying to improve it. But he is a self-appointed crusader against political correctness and the nanny state and is a scourge of well-meaning ministers and backbenchers whom he regards as ""do-gooders"" and ""busybodies"". During his speech, he said: ""We are in danger of passing a piece of legislation that everybody in this House knows is not as good as it should be and not as good as it could be, largely because of the paralysis of decision making within the Government. ""I suspect that the civil service appear to have taken the Government hostage in the running of public policy."" Calls for PM to act as Tory MP blocks upskirting law He later added: ""I think the Department of Health is one of the worst offenders for being taken hostage by its civil servants and I'm being charitable by saying that. ""I presume that's the reason why we get so many socialist, nanny-state proposals coming from the Department of Health. ""I can't believe the ministers can actually believe in all that rubbish, so it must be the civil servants who are running the department."" Mr Davies has considerable form, however for long speeches during Friday sittings when private members' bills are debated and time is limited. He has argued that his motive is to ensure bills which sound well-meaning but are badly drafted do not get waved through without proper scrutiny, He once spoke for 77 minutes against proposals designed to help end violence against women and on another occasion used a speech of more than 50 minutes to help kill off a move to make first aid education compulsory at secondary schools. There have been many calls for a change in the Commons rules to prevent just one MP sabotaging a Bill by shouting ""Object!"" But that would face fierce backbench opposition, led - inevitably - by Sir Christopher and Mr Davies."

But video footage posted on social media showed the yellow Hyundai taxi swerve violently out of a line of stationary traffic, mount a pavement and collide with pedestrians. The vehicle then drove for around 10m (30ft), knocking people over, before hitting a traffic sign. The driver then ran away from the car, but was tackled by bystanders. The latest as Croatia take on Nigeria in group D. Police in the Russian capital said a criminal investigation had been opened into a suspected violation of the traffic code following the accident near Red Square. In a post on Twitter, Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin said: ""There was an unpleasant incident with a taxi. The driver lost control of the vehicle."" In a statement, Moscow's city healthcare department said seven people were in a satisfactory condition and one woman was seriously injured. The Mexican embassy in the city said two Mexican women had suffered slight injuries. Among the others hurt were a Ukrainian and two Russian citizens, according to TASS news agency. One witness, Viktoria Geraimovich, said: ""There were shouts, moans. He was only stopped because he hit a traffic sign. ""Someone gave him a punch in the face. He stayed in the car, people came up to him, said what are you doing, punched him in the face, he opened the door and tried to run away.""

William Thurston, 29, and Shelby Thurston, 26, were both found guilty of manslaughter by negligence, and of a health and safety offence. Sentencing, Mr Justice Graham said the married couple had taken the most ""monumental risk with children's lives by continuing to allow children on the bouncy castle"". ""That risk-taking cost Summer her life,"" he said. He called on health and safety experts to make it compulsory for fairground operators to have proper wind speed measuring equipment, calling it ""extraordinary"" that it should be commonplace not to. A yellow weather warning had been in place on the day of the incident, which took place two days before storm Katie hit Britain in March 2016. Prosecutors had argued the bouncy castle had not been adequately anchored to the ground and the defendants had failed to monitor weather conditions to ensure it was safe. The instruction manual for the inflatable was destroyed a year before the incident in a fire, the court heard. Onlookers said they saw the bouncy castle ""rolling"" down the hill after being lifted 30 to 50ft in the air, over a caravan and into a field. Summer's mother Cara Blackie said she had screamed when she heard that her daughter had died, and now suffers from debilitating anxiety and depression. She was unable to read her full statement at the hearing. ""I never thought that my Summer playing and having fun on the bouncy castle would end her young life,"" she said. The girl's father, Lee Grant, said he heard a scream and turned to see the bouncy castle in the air. He attempted to give chase but could do nothing. Summer was rescued from the bouncy castle but she died from her injuries in hospital. ""When Summer died, I felt as if I died too,"" he said. ""I felt as if I had nothing left to live for because she was my beautiful angel."""

The Afghan government called for an extension to the ceasefire as it released Taliban prisoners on Saturday. But a suicide bomber attacked a gathering of the two sides as they celebrated the halt in hostilities. Afghan forces manning checkpoints offered Eid greetings to the Taliban, posing for photos with the insurgents. Only a few days before, this bonhomie would have been unthinkable as the two sides have not held a ceasefire since the 2001 US invasion. Dozens of unarmed Taliban militants entered Kabul and other cities on Saturday to celebrate the end of Ramadan. Wearing traditional headgear, traffic jams formed in the capital as people stopped to take pictures of the fighters waving both their flag and the Afghan flag. They left their weapons at the city's gates, which will be returned when they leave, Kabul police spokesman Hashmat Stanekzai said. But in other provinces the insurgents were carrying rocket launchers, grenades and ammunition. Villagers still flocked around the militants, hugging them and taking selfies. ""I am here to offer greetings to our brothers in the police and army,"" Taliban commander Baba said. ""We have held the ceasefire well so far. Everyone is tired of war and if our leaders order us to continue the ceasefire, we will hold it forever."" A Taliban fighter on a motorbike carrying Afghan and Taliban flags warned long-lasting peace would only be achieved if US forces left the country. ""We want an Islamic country and government. This cannot happen unless America leaves,"" he said. In a rare televised address, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani announced on Saturday the government was extending the week-long ceasefire which was due to end on Tuesday. He asked the Taliban to extend their three-day ceasefire which is due to end on Sunday. The president also announced that 46 Taliban prisoners had been released in the spirit of the Eid ceasefire. His office said a ban had been lifted on Taliban fighters receiving normal state assistance and benefits. But as Mr Ghani was making his address, a suicide car bomber blew himself up in a crowd of Taliban, security forces and civilians celebrating the ceasefire. At least 20 people were killed and 16 others wounded in Rodat outside the Nangarhar provincial capital of Jalalabad, provincial governor spokesman Attaullah Khogyani said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, but the Taliban said it was not responsible. The Afghan government's original eight-day ceasefire, which started on Tuesday, does not include other militant groups operating in the country, including the Islamic State."

Many attendees at the Labour Live event also sported ""B******* to Brexit"" stickers, while others looked to put further pressure on the leadership to change their stance on the UK's departure from the EU. Mixing politics with music at the White Hart Lane Recreation Ground on Saturday, Labour Live aimed to build on the success of the party's rallies during last year's snap general election campaign. Despite the event being dogged by reports of poor sales, Labour sources said more than 13,000 tickets had been sold before the festival opened, with tickets still available on the day at the 20,000-capacity venue. Two days before the event, Labour slashed the price of tickets by 70%. Moments after Mr Corbyn took to the main stage to the familiar chorus of ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" - sung to the tune of the White Stripes' Seven Nation Army - activists, understood to be from the People's Vote campaign, made their protest against the Labour leader's Brexit stance. The group wants a referendum on the final Brexit deal. Labour Live followed a week in which Mr Corbyn suffered the biggest rebellion of his leadership. Last Wednesday, 90 Labour MPs ignored Mr Corbyn's order not to take part in a House of Commons vote on staying in the EU's single market through membership of the European Economic Area (EEA). One of the party's prominent MEPs, Seb Dance, also made a plea for Mr Corbyn to consider backing a second referendum on EU membership. Speaking to Sky News, Mr Dance revealed he had attended Labour Live to help provide ""recommendations on what members of the Labour Party can do to get motions passed, to get discussion on stopping Brexit at a local party level"". He said: ""The majority of Labour voters voted Remain, even in areas that overall voted Leave. ""That's what we've got to remember, so I think the party needs to look again at what its policy is on this and I think we can move into a much better place. ""The best thing Corbyn can say is he's not ruling out any options, keeping options including supporting the People's Vote on the table, including single market and customs union membership. Let's keep those options open."" Among the musical acts at Labour Live, The Magic Numbers dedicated a song to Mr Corbyn as someone who ""believes in things, believes in the NHS"". Shadow chancellor John McDonnell later praised the band, telling the crowd: ""I'm glad the Magic Numbers were playing here today because when we put the numbers together, it will be magical what we can do with society."" Mr Corbyn hailed fellow performers Reverend and The Makers as having unwittingly ""turned the election campaign in a very interesting way"" in 2017, when the Labour leader was invited to join the band on stage at a gig in May last year. MPs present at Labour Live were those most loyal to Mr Corbyn, including Mr McDonnell, shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, shadow women and equalities secretary Dawn Butler, shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner, and local Tottenham MP David Lammy. Appearing on stage earlier in the afternoon, Mr Lammy told the crowd: ""There's only one reason for Labour Live and that's to get rid of Theresa May."" Among food stalls, a coconut shy, face-painting and a tent organised by the Corbyn-supporting Momentum group, the Unite union were handing out free ice cream to attendees. The union's general secretary Len McCluskey - an ally to Mr Corbyn - used his appearance at the event's ""Solidarity Tent"" to continue his attack on Labour MPs who have been critical of the party leader's leadership. The Unite boss claimed they had been ""slapped in the face"" by last year's election result, as he insisted Mr Corbyn was the only reason there had yet to be another national poll, despite the current hung parliament. A Labour Party spokesperson hailed the event as ""a fantastic day"", adding: ""The tents have been packed all day and there has been a great atmosphere. ""This is the first event of its kind organised by a political party and we have demonstrated how politics can be opened up to a wider audience and to people who have been shut out for far too long."""

Nearby homes had to be evacuated, and officials warned other residents to stay inside and keep their windows closed. More than 70 firefighters using 10 fire engines and 11 supporting appliances, including a crane, have been at the scene to attempt to bring the blaze under control. Images showed major damage to the roof of the church as flames engulfed the inside of the building. Around 8.10pm there was a large ""explosion"" in the church, according to witnesses. WalesOnline reported members of the congregation watched on in horror, crying as they saw the fire's impact. One member reported arriving at the building to set up the youth club shortly before the fire took hold. The church was 140 years old, and the congregation had been raising £183,500 to repair the roof and create a new floor in the upper area. Paster Andrew Cleverley told WalesOnline: ""We were in the process of redeveloping it all and now it's gone. ""The inside of the roof was quite unique. It was all wood.""

His representative announced on Friday that the actor had died after a long battle with cancer. Best known for his role in the BBC soap, he played Albert Square's notorious villain 'Dirty' Den from 1985 to 1989. Dobson told BBC News: ""He was a good-looking guy, he was a charmer, he was funny, he was a good actor. And he was fun to be around, we were good mates. ""But I think there's always that kind of look about him that you just didn't know what he was going to do next, and that was his ace in the hole, there was always that bit about him that was slightly unpredictable, which I liked and what gave him the edge on TV."" She said they were both ""really lucky"" they were cast opposite each other because they had chemistry. ""We didn't have to do anything, it just happened. We learnt our lines, we met on set and bang, we were off."" Dobson added: ""I came from nothing, from the east end with no money, and Leslie, as you know, had a chequered life before EastEnders, but we sort of understood each other, we understood that life can be tough. ""And we were fortunate, we were catapulted to an exotic place, but we were playing real people, people that we knew and we loved it."" The 1986 Christmas Day episode - in which Grantham handed over divorce papers to his on-screen wife, Angie - broke all soap episode ratings pulling in more than 30 million viewers. Grantham leaves behind three children - Spike, Jake and Danny - from his 31 year marriage to former actress Jane Laurie. A private funeral will be held for friends and family in due course."

She will announce that money that no longer needs to be sent to the EU after Britain leaves the bloc will help fund the increase. Taxpayers will also be asked to contribute more for the NHS and the government will be forced to borrow money. The announcement means the NHS will receive an extra £384m a week - a further £34m than promised in the controversial pledge advertised on the side of the Leave campaign bus in the run up to the referendum. A long-term plan will be drawn up with help from doctors to set out how the resources should be allocated. Writing in the Mail on Sunday, Mrs May said: ""Now, as we leave the European Union and stop paying significant annual subscriptions to Brussels, we will have more money to spend on priorities such as the NHS. ""But to give the NHS the funding it needs for the future, this Brexit dividend will not be enough. ""As a country, we need to contribute a bit more in a fair and balanced way. We will listen to views about how we do this and the Chancellor will set out the detail in due course. To deliver, this plan must be about more than money. "" The move comes as Mrs May faces another difficult week in Parliament with Tory rebels again threatening to defy her over how much influence MPs will have over any EU withdrawal deal. ""As the prime minister announces a historic long-term funding boost and 10-year plan for the health service, we are backing the NHS to show the world what a cutting-edge 21st century healthcare system can look like too,"" said Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt.

Mr Hunt added that the money will create an opportunity for the NHS ""to write an entirely new chapter in its history"". Writing in The Sunday Telegraph, Mr Hunt said: ""The debate over Brexit can be divisive, but that famous campaign promise can now unite us all: the British public voted for £350m a week for the NHS, and that - and more - is exactly what this Government will deliver."" Sustainable long-term funding for the NHS could cost £2,000 for every household in Britain, or the equivalent of 9p on income tax, two respected think tanks previously told Sky News. Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, said: ""As the NHS turns 70, we can now face the next five years with renewed certainty. ""This multi-year settlement provides the funding we need to shape a long-term plan for key improvements in cancer, mental health and other critical services."" British Medical Association (BMA) chairman Dr Chaand Nagpaul welcomed the funding boost, saying: ""Patients, doctors and healthcare staff have been united in calling for an urgent and substantial increase in funding as the NHS struggles under unprecedented pressures that have driven waiting times and delays to historic highs. ""It is refreshing that the government has finally conceded that our health service needs extra resources, with BMA analysis showing a significant funding gap compared to other leading European countries. ""However, we will be scrutinising the detail of this new package of funding to assess the degree to which it will make a real difference in both the short and long term to frontline patient care."""

He was taken to Chelsea and Westminster Hospital on Friday after the frequency of his seizures increased. Ms Caldwell said on Saturday that Billy had two seizures overnight but he was now stable and asleep. She said: ""Billy had two more seizures overnight which is putting him further into a crisis situation."" A family spokesman said the Home Office has released the medicinal cannabis oil, which is now on its way to the hospital. In a statement, Home Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""This morning, I've used an exceptional power as home secretary to urgently issue a licence to allow Billy Caldwell to be treated with cannabis oil. ""This is a very complex situation, but our immediate priority is making sure Billy receives the most effective treatment possible in a safe way. ""We have been in close contact with Billy's medical team overnight and my decision is based on the advice of senior clinicians who have made clear this is a medical emergency. ""The policing minister met with the family on Monday and since then has been working to reach an urgent solution."" Ms Caldwell said she was ""over the moon"" at the release of the medicine but she criticised the ""dreadful, horrific, cruel experience"" that has deeply affected Billy. She said: ""His little body has been completely broken and his little mind. ""I truly believe that somewhere in the Home Office there's someone with a heart and I truly believe that Billy was pulling on their heart strings."" She vowed to keep up her fight to allow others in the UK to have access to the medication they need. Ms Caldwell added: ""My experience leaves me in no doubt that the Home Office can no longer play a role in the administration of medication for sick children in our country. ""Children are dying in our country and it needs to stop now."" Sinn Féin MP Órfhlaith Begley welcomed confirmation that Billy would now get his treatment. She said: ""Billy should never have been put in that position. The treatment was clearly working for him and he deteriorated badly once it ended, yet it still took intense lobbying to get the Home Office to reverse this cruel decision."" Ms Caldwell praised medical teams at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. She said: ""The staff here have been amazing. He is getting the best medical care in the world. I cannot thank the staff at the hospital enough."" Billy, who is also autistic, with pronounced communication difficulties, suffered back-to-back seizures on Friday after being seizure-free for more than 300 days when he was previously given the cannabis oil, according to his family. Billy, from County Tyrone in Northern Ireland, was given a prescription for medicinal cannabis oil last year to help treat his epilepsy - the first time the drug had been prescribed by the NHS. But the boy's doctor was told by Home Office drug enforcement teams to stop prescribing the medication, which Ms Caldwell credits with keeping her son's seizures at bay. The family had planned to return to Canada if they could not get the medicine in the UK but say Billy is now too ill to travel. More follows..."

Mr Trump accused the ""Fake News Media"" of only showing ""the bad photos (implying anger)"" of the summit. At the G7 summit, which Prime Minister Theresa May described as ""difficult"" and ""candid"", Mr Trump caused a stir when he refused to endorse the conclusions of the meeting.  Since then, eyebrow-raising comments made by the US president have been reported by the Wall Street Journal. In one meeting, Mr Trump raised the issue of migration as a problem in Europe and reportedly told Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe: ""Shinzo, you don't have this problem, but I can send you 25 million Mexicans and you'll be out of office very soon."" In another, during a conversation about terrorism, he is said to have told French President Emmanuel Macron that ""You must know about this, Emmanuel, because all the terrorists are in Paris"". The President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Junker, was asked by reporters to respond to Mr Trump repeatedly calling him a ""brutal killer"". Mr Junker said ""I think he meant it as a compliment but I’m not so sure"", over the comments which allegedly referred to Brussels' tax fines against US tech companies and blocks on America dealing directly with Germany and France for trade deals. A photo of Mr Trump surrounded by disgruntled looking leaders at the summit went viral after the conference. I have a great relationship with Angela Merkel of Germany, but the Fake News Media only shows the bad photos (implying anger) of negotiating an agreement - where I am asking for things that no other American President would ask for! pic.twitter.com/Ib97nN5HZt Now, a week later, the president followed up his claims that the situation was a ""very friendly"" one by publishing a series of photos on his Twitter account, some showing German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau smiling.

The men have been named locally as Martin Andrews and his teenage son Jack, according to the Huddersfield Daily Examiner. Officers were called at 11.20am after a passer-by saw personal belongings, including clothes, a mobile phone, a camera and a set of car keys by the waterside which had been there for about 50 minutes. West Yorkshire Police said officers located a car parked near the Pudsey area of Leeds, where a woman confirmed her 43-year-old husband and his 19-year-old son had gone magnet fishing at 6.15am. Magnet fishing is understood to be a hobby that involves trawling waterways for metal using strong magnets on a rope. A police spokesman said divers were called in following an extensive search of the area and there being no trace of the two men. He said the divers located the bodies at 7.22pm. ""The family are aware and inquiries are ongoing into how they ended up in the water,"" he added. A dog walker who reportedly found the pair's belongings told the Huddersfield Daily Examiner she ""thought there was something not right"". ""I had a quick look to see if there was anyone about but I couldn't see anyone,"" she said. ""I left it for half an hour or so and called the police. Stayed at the site until they arrived.

Charlotte Caldwell, of Castlederg in Co Tyrone, Northern Ireland, said the youngster was showing signs of improvement after receiving three doses of the drug at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. She now wants the law changed so other children with similar conditions can get the drugs. An emergency treatment licence, invoked by Mr Javis on Saturday, grants Billy about 20 days' treatment, but Ms Caldwell says she is confident he will get the rest of the drugs. A senior clinician can apply for a longer licence when he has recovered sufficiently to be seen by neurologists. Ms Caldwell said it had been ""absolutely horrific"" and ""cruel"" that Billy had been refused the cannabis oil. She urged the Home Secretary to authorise the release of the rest of his six-month supply and told Sky News she would not leave London until Mr Javid had met her. Ms Caldwell said: ""This experience that myself and my little boy have endured in this last week has been horrendous, I do not want, and I will not stand by and let, any other family in our country endure it. It's absolutely horrific, it's cruel. ""I want nobody in Government, and nobody who has been impacted by massively outdated laws, to be under any impression that this is job done. This is just the start. ""The energy we've brought to Billy's campaign is as nothing compared to what we are prepared to unleash to drive complete reform. ""I want to meet the Home Secretary and Health Secretary, urgently, this week, to get assurance that not only will Billy's meds never again be removed, but to call for an urgent review of the overall policy on medical cannabis as it affects everyone who could benefit."" Mr Javid said he had used ""an exceptional power"" to ""urgently issue"" a licence to treat Billy with cannabis oil. Ms Caldwell says the oil is keeping the boy's seizures at bay and he had been free of seizures for more than 300 days while using it previously. She said: ""We have experts at Chelsea and Westminster who have seen the improvement in Billy. ""This is a medical, clinical decision to use it. It is not a decision to be taken by bureaucrats and politicians. They are not qualified to take that decision."" Former drugs minister Norman Baker has described the confiscation of the oil as ""cruel and inhumane"", and repeated his calls for the law to be changed.Mr Baker said: ""It became very clear to me in my time as drugs minister that cannabis has useful medical properties and, indeed, that it is the only substance that works for some people, a situation widely recognised in other countries."""
2018-06-17,"At the beginning of this year a rather irritated chancellor Philip Hammond publicly knocked back demands from Boris Johnson for a ""Brexit dividend"" for the NHS.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180617210717/https://news.sky.com/story/chancellor-philip-hammond-faces-perfect-storm-over-brexit-dividend-for-nhs-11407764,"Instead of making good on the Vote Leave promise that leaving the EU would result in another £350m a week for the NHS's coffers, the chancellor warned that Britain's economy was suffering due to uncertainty over Brexit. Increases in public spending would have to wait. So imagine his quiet fury this morning as the prime minister announced that the NHS would be getting a post-Brexit boost in the form of an additional £20bn-a-year in real terms by 2023/4. That amounts to an annual 3.4% increase from 2019 onwards - and it's been left to Mr Hammond to work out were the money will come from. Politically, Mrs May has little option but to deliver some form of Brexit dividend for the NHS. Whether she supported the claim or not, it is now down to her to deliver the Brexit the public voted for and NHS funding was the centrepiece of the Vote Leave deal. But in reality, the ""Brexit dividend"" is just political spin. Any money coming to the NHS in the next five years will have to come from increased borrowing or taxation. This is because the net £9bn-a-year we pay into the EU every year has already been earmarked up to the year 2022 at the very least. It's going to be used to pay Britain's £39bn Brexit divorce bill and maintain farm subsidies for British farmers amongst other things. There isn't spare money lying around to be put into the NHS. And, aside from all of that, there is unlikely to even be a ""Brexit dividend"". As Paul Johnson of the Institute of Fiscal Studies pointed out, the government has already accepted analysis from the fiscal watchdog that Brexit will weaken public finances by £15bn a year. ""There is no Brexit dividend,"" says Mr Johnson. ""Payments to the EU will fall, but tax revenues will fall more as a result of Brexit. It will come from higher taxes and borrowing."" What's more, the prime minister's claim that the NHS will receive another £600m a week in cash terms - and linking it to the £350m a week on the side of the Vote Leave bus - is also misleading. The £600m is based on a nominal spending rather than real spending, so it takes in money to cover inflation too. ""Don't even begin to swallow any rubbish that this will be some Brexit bonanza,"" tweeted Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, the chair of the health select committee. ""In reality the tax rises and borrowing will need to be higher as a result."" Whatever the spin, what is clear from Mrs May's announcement is that the spending review this autumn will be bitter. Mr Hammond will have to decide how to fund NHS increases. Will the chancellor increase taxes (and break a manifesto pledge) or decide instead to borrow more to pay for public services? He could try to pay for NHS increases by finding cuts elsewhere, but the public is fed up with austerity, and her cabinet are too. Watch for a slew of demands for more spending for defence, schools and housing, all coming as the chancellor warns of weakening public finances in the face of Brexit. Another perfect storm for the autumn."
2018-06-17,"Rebuilding the Glasgow School of Art following a the devastating fire could cost at least £100m, according to experts.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180617210717/https://news.sky.com/story/repairing-glasgow-school-of-art-building-would-cost-at-least-100m-say-experts-11407927,"Academics specialising in fire risk and construction management at Glasgow Caledonian University came up with the estimated cost of rebuilding the Mackintosh building. Professor Billy Hare said: ""The damage to the School of Art appeared to be overwhelming, much worse than the last fire from which recovered materials were painstakingly analysed and used in the refurbishment of the building. ""It is sadly questionable what, if anything, will be left that could be salvaged, restored or recreated after this fire. ""It remains to be seen if it will be possible to retain a facade from the current building. If not, damaged buildings have been taken down almost stone by stone in the past and rebuilt with a new, internal frame. ""This sort of project will cost a great deal more than the estimated £35m after the last fire in May 2014"". The academics believe it is likely the fire started in the upper levels of the building - designed by architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh - due to the roof appearing well alight early on. The building had been undergoing a multimillion-pound restoration programme, which had been due to be completed next year. A blaze that ""consumed"" Glasgow's world-renowned School of Art has been described as ""heartbreaking"". Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon said the blaze was ""heartbreaking"" and that her government was ""ready to do anything we reasonably can"" in the wake of the fire. Ms Sturgeon said it was too early to draw conclusions on what may have caused the fire as she hailed the efforts of emergency workers at the scene. At its height, more than 120 firefighters were battling the flames."

Many attendees at the Labour Live event also sported ""B******* to Brexit"" stickers, while others looked to put further pressure on the leadership to change their stance on the UK's departure from the EU. Mixing politics with music at the White Hart Lane Recreation Ground on Saturday, Labour Live aimed to build on the success of the party's rallies during last year's snap general election campaign. Despite the event being dogged by reports of poor sales, Labour sources said more than 13,000 tickets had been sold before the festival opened, with tickets still available on the day at the 20,000-capacity venue. Two days before the event, Labour slashed the price of tickets by 70%. Moments after Mr Corbyn took to the main stage to the familiar chorus of ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" - sung to the tune of the White Stripes' Seven Nation Army - activists, understood to be from the People's Vote campaign, made their protest against the Labour leader's Brexit stance. The group wants a referendum on the final Brexit deal. Labour Live followed a week in which Mr Corbyn suffered the biggest rebellion of his leadership. Last Wednesday, 90 Labour MPs ignored Mr Corbyn's order not to take part in a House of Commons vote on staying in the EU's single market through membership of the European Economic Area (EEA). One of the party's prominent MEPs, Seb Dance, also made a plea for Mr Corbyn to consider backing a second referendum on EU membership. Speaking to Sky News, Mr Dance revealed he had attended Labour Live to help provide ""recommendations on what members of the Labour Party can do to get motions passed, to get discussion on stopping Brexit at a local party level"". He said: ""The majority of Labour voters voted Remain, even in areas that overall voted Leave. ""That's what we've got to remember, so I think the party needs to look again at what its policy is on this and I think we can move into a much better place. ""The best thing Corbyn can say is he's not ruling out any options, keeping options including supporting the People's Vote on the table, including single market and customs union membership. Let's keep those options open."" Among the musical acts at Labour Live, The Magic Numbers dedicated a song to Mr Corbyn as someone who ""believes in things, believes in the NHS"". Shadow chancellor John McDonnell later praised the band, telling the crowd: ""I'm glad the Magic Numbers were playing here today because when we put the numbers together, it will be magical what we can do with society."" Mr Corbyn hailed fellow performers Reverend and The Makers as having unwittingly ""turned the election campaign in a very interesting way"" in 2017, when the Labour leader was invited to join the band on stage at a gig in May last year. MPs present at Labour Live were those most loyal to Mr Corbyn, including Mr McDonnell, shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, shadow women and equalities secretary Dawn Butler, shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner, and local Tottenham MP David Lammy. Appearing on stage earlier in the afternoon, Mr Lammy told the crowd: ""There's only one reason for Labour Live and that's to get rid of Theresa May."" Among food stalls, a coconut shy, face-painting and a tent organised by the Corbyn-supporting Momentum group, the Unite union were handing out free ice cream to attendees. The union's general secretary Len McCluskey - an ally to Mr Corbyn - used his appearance at the event's ""Solidarity Tent"" to continue his attack on Labour MPs who have been critical of the party leader's leadership. The Unite boss claimed they had been ""slapped in the face"" by last year's election result, as he insisted Mr Corbyn was the only reason there had yet to be another national poll, despite the current hung parliament. A Labour Party spokesperson hailed the event as ""a fantastic day"", adding: ""The tents have been packed all day and there has been a great atmosphere. ""This is the first event of its kind organised by a political party and we have demonstrated how politics can be opened up to a wider audience and to people who have been shut out for far too long."""

It is the first step towards a fully autonomous machine that could whisk passengers through city traffic far more safely. Engineer Torquil Ross-Martin has set up a company, AutoRd Limited, to develop the bike. He said the on-board computer reacts far more quickly than a brain to dangerous situations, such as a gust of wind or an obstruction. ""A computer can do a better job than a human can because it is always concentrating. ""When commuting you are not necessarily completely focussed on what you are doing. ""You are thinking about what you are going to do when you get to the office or whether you are running late. ""That's where the bike will improve the safety for commuters."" Sensors on the bike can detect the direction and speed of movement so the computer can tell if it is falling to one side. Small corrections in the automatic steering instantly re-balance the bike. I was the first journalist to be allowed to ride as a passenger. The bike swayed from side to side - a little unnervingly - until it picked up speed. But the rest of the route was smooth. By the time we tilted to one side to turn around I was confident that I wouldn't need the 'kill switch' that I had my finger on. It was a remarkable - if slightly eerie - insight to a future in which autonomous bikes are the ultimate urban taxi. But for now the prototype is being used in conjunction with AB Dynamics to test how autonomous cars react to motorbikes. Currently checks are done with soft targets, such as foam cut-outs, because the risk to a human rider would be too great. Richard Simpson, a control systems engineer for the company, said the technology needs far more vigorous testing to keep other road-users safe. ""Motorbikes are really agile and often faster than cars,"" he said. ""They can weave in and out of traffic and accelerate really hard. ""Soft targets have a different radar signature, so that's why you need to use a motorcycle for realistic testing."" The bike needs to be fitted with LIDAR laser equipment - already used on autonomous cars to detect objects - before it is road-ready. It will need extensive development work and AutoRd is looking for a commercial partner."

But the government's decision to link part of the extra money to the infamous Vote Leave pledge to spend the money Britain sends to European Union on the NHS instead has provoked much comment. The totemic claim - widely questioned by experts during the 2016 referendum - that we send £350m a week to the EU formed an integral part of the Brexit campaign's clarion call to ""take back control"" from Brussels. Mrs May told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""Some people may remember seeing a figure on the side of a bus a while back of £350m a week in cash. ""Well, I can tell you what I am announcing will mean that in 2023-24, there will be about £600m a week in cash, more in cash, going into the NHS."" While many have welcomed news of the extra money, critics - including some within the PM's own party - poured scorn on the ""Brexit dividend"" characterisation, saying there was no such thing. They argue the economic damage of leaving the EU will far outweigh any money we save in payments to Brussels. One Tory MP was particularly scathing in her assessment, labelling the claim ""tosh"".

Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, also dismissed the term in a series of tweets: Extra NHS funding at 3.4% p.a. means rises over next 5 years higher than over last 8, but still below long run average.

""Claiming some bogus Brexit dividend is clearly something that doesn't exist - and she's only saying that because she's got her arm twisted up her back by her Cabinet Brexit hardliners."" There have also been calls for more details on how the pledge will be paid for. When Mrs May was asked where the non-""Brexit dividend"" element of the funding would come from, she said: ""As a country we will be contributing more, a bit more, but also we will have that sum of money that is available from the European Union."" The PM has promised that Chancellor Philip Hammond will set out more details ""in due course"", but it is expected taxpayers will be asked to contribute more and/or there will be extra government borrowing."

Mr Javid said he was targeted by criminals outside Euston station in north London a few months before he was promoted to the Home Office. ""It happened in a flash. I was walking out of Euston station and reached for my phone to call a taxi,"" he told The Sun. :: Why moped crime is rising - and how you can avoid being a victim ""It was brand new. Before I knew what was happening, it had gone. They just rode up, grabbed it and zoomed off. ""I was angry and upset but thought myself lucky not to have been stabbed or beaten up like many other victims who fall prey to these vicious criminals."" He does not comment on whether he reported the crime to the police. Mr Javid, who was communities secretary when the incident occurred, has recently committed to giving police chiefs more support. In June, it was reported that more than 60 crimes using mopeds or motorbikes were carried out every day in London on average over the past year - a 50% increase on the previous 12 months. Earlier this month, comedian Michael McIntrye was targeted by armed moped robbers and a 24-year-old woman was left in a critical condition after two men on a moped punched her and stole her phone the same day. The problem is not isolated to the capital, with spates of violent crime being reported across the country. Father-of-four Mr Javid said he worries about his children if they are out late. ""Our streets should be safe at all times, you shouldn't have to worry about things like knife or other crime,"" he said. Earlier this month, the prime minister was challenged about the government's response to criminals using mopeds to carry crimes. She said talks with police had taken place to make sure they had the powers they needed to be able to chase moped-riding criminals. ""This issue of moped crime is one that is of concern for people,"" Mrs May admitted. Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Police said it is ""doing all it can"" to bring thieves to justice after figures suggested less than 5% of burglaries and robberies across the country are being solved. The Met said it is putting a ""huge amount of effort"" into tackling a rise in moped-related crime, which it said has reduced."

The immigration policy announced in May has resulted in several hundred children being split up from their parents at the US-Mexico border. Mr Trump has defended the policy, saying the Democrats were ""forcing the breakup of families at the Border with their horrible and cruel legislative agenda"". On Saturday he tweeted: ""Democrats can fix their forced family breakup at the Border by working with republicans on new legislation, for a change!"" Legend and his wife, model Chrissy Teigen, have been fierce critics of Mr Trump and she recently used Twitter to criticise the immigration policy, saying she and members of her family were donating cash to the American civil liberties union and urged others to contribute. She wrote: ""John and I are outraged to see and hear the horror stories of immigrant families seeking asylum and refuge in America being ripped apart due to the inhumane policies of the Trump administration. ""These actions are cruel, anti-family and go against everything we believe this country should represent."""
2018-06-17,Angela Merkel's leadership is under threat after her alliance partner gave her two weeks to agree to turn away refugees at Germany's borders.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180617210717/https://news.sky.com/story/german-chancellor-angela-merkels-leadership-under-threat-over-migrant-policy-11407939,"In an unprecedented challenge to her 13 years as Germany's chancellor, a resolution by her interior minister, Horst Seehofer, is set to be passed on Monday, party aides told German newspaper Bild Zeitung. He wants Germany to send back migrants who have already registered in other EU countries. The policy would undermine Mrs Merkel's authority after she operated an open-door approach in 2015 which led to thousands of migrants entering Germany after first coming to the EU through another country. Mr Seehofer will give Mrs Merkel two weeks to gain support from her EU partners to halt the policy, or he will carry out the order himself. The rebel minister is leader of the Christian Social Union in Bavaria, whose parent party is Mrs Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU). The two parties are part of the same overall coalition running Germany. Mrs Merkel is trying to get France to create a joint proposal with her to tighten asylum rules before the EU leaders summit in late June. The government denied wanting to discuss possible bilateral solutions with Greece, Italy and Austria on how to deal with the large numbers of people fleeing conflict. However, a spokesman said Mrs Merkel is in close contact with those states. Mr Merkel is adamant that there needs to be a Europe-wide migrant policy, but Mr Seehofer disagrees and last week reportedly told CSU leaders in private he ""can no longer work"" with the chancellor. She asked the CSU to give her two weeks to come up with deals similar to one agreed between Turkey and the EU in 2016, which means migrants arriving in Greece are sent back to Turkey if they do not apply for asylum. In return, Turkey, which is not in the EU, receives aid and its citizens are allowed visa-free travel to the Schengen passport-free zone. The German chancellor wants the EU to give states more power to turn away refugees to stop Germany being the only one with the policy. Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, secretary general of Mrs Merkel's CDU Party, said: ""It could weaken our negotiating position and potentially impact other areas such as the euro."" The migrant issue has come to a head this week after a new Italian government refused to let a ship carrying 629 migrants dock at its ports. Italy's foreign affairs minister Enzo Moavero Milanesi said on Sunday the political strategy is meant to shake consciences. He said his country will present proposals to revamp the EU's asylum laws at the EU summit on 28 June. ""The issue of migrants is epic and Europe has remained detached for years about it,"" Mr Milanesi. On Sunday the migrants arrived in Valencia after the Spanish government said it would take them. They have 45 days to rest in Spain after weeks at sea before they have to start organising their legal statuses."
2018-06-17,Some transplant patients are not getting the best treatment because of a national shortage of heart valve donations.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180617210717/https://news.sky.com/story/more-heart-valve-donations-particularly-for-children-needed-by-nhs-11407322,"Although the NHS can generally meet demand on most transplant tissue such as eyes, skin and tendons, they are currently struggling to provide enough human heart valves. It means that surgeons are having to use tissue from pigs or mechanical valves which are not generally as reliable. Kyle Bennett, a manager at the NHS Blood and Transplant centre in Liverpool, urged people to have a conversation with loved ones about donating tissue and organs. He said: ""It's just trying to think what would you want for your child should they need a valve. It's an incredibly tough decision at probably the most difficult time of their lives. But donor families get a lot of comfort in knowing that they've donated tissue that has then gone on the help save the lives of somebody else."" NHS Blood and Transplant needs around 60 heart valve donations a month to meet clinical demand but currently receives around 40. Parents Pete and Amanda Ridgwell from York joined a campaign to boost donations after their six-week-old daughter Emily died in a hospice. Emily had suffered a series of low oxygen crashes but her heart valves were used to help save the lives of two other girls - one aged seven months and the other just one month old. Amanda told Sky News: ""Emily had such a short life and such difficult times that you wanted something positive to have come out of it and there to have been a reason. ""We just thought that maybe if she could help other people in similar situations... that there could have been a bit of a purpose to what happened. ""We were so proud of her anyway but we thought it would be a lovely, extra legacy."" More donations from all age groups are needed by the NHS. There is a particular need for paediatric donors as they provide small-sized valves which are needed for certain types of operations on children."

A woman was hit on the head by a rock and a man was treated for breathing problems during the clashes. The trouble broke out when about 500 demonstrators waving Greek flags tried to approach the signature ceremony on the banks of Lake Prespa. But they were surrounded by police near the small village of Pisoderi, about 16 miles from the ceremony. Riot police blocked the rural road leading to the lake, while others on mountain slopes threw stun grenades and tear gas at the crowd. The authorities said about 5,000 people took part in the protest against the agreement. One protester said: ""We are fighting for the land of our fathers. We are not backing down."" :: Can you name these eight countries that changed names Since 1991, Athens has objected to its neighbour being called Macedonia because it has its own northern province of the same name, which in ancient times was the cradle of Alexander the Great's empire At the fishing village of Psarades, where the deal was signed, priests tolled the local church bell in a sign of mourning. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said the agreement would heal wounds between the two countries. He said: ""This is a brave, historic and necessary step for our peoples. ""We are here to heal the wounds of time, to open a path for peace, fraternisation and growth for our countries, the Balkans and Europe."" Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev said: ""Our two countries should step out of the past and look to the future. ""Our peoples want peace... we will be partners and allies."""

The bloated snake was found close to the victim's belongings, including her sandals and a flashlight. The villagers cut open the 23ft-long creature and found Ms Tiba's body was intact after she had been swallowed head first. The village's chief, known as Faris, said: ""When they cut open the snake's belly they found Tiba's body still intact with all her clothes."" A man suffered seizures after the severed head of a rattlesnake bit him. A police spokesman added: ""Residents were suspicious the snake swallowed the victim, so they killed it, then carried it out of the garden. ""The snake's belly was cut open and the body of the victim was found inside."" The garden was at the base of a rocky cliff and known to be home to snakes, the spokesman said. Giant pythons, which regularly top 5.7m (19ft) , are commonly found in Indonesia and the Philippines. While the snakes have been known to attack small animals, attempts to eat people are rare.

The 30-year-old Irish actress, who plays Clare in TV series Derry Girls, also pointed out that this is the second time Mr Fisher has commented on her weight in a review for the British Theatre Guide. Can't wait to take the stage tonight for #MissJeanBrodie with the leggy Angus @anguswright, the shapely Ed MacLiam, and the curvy @kittheyounger ;) In a review last August of Jess And Joe Forever, in which she played Jess, Coughlan claimed that he started the review with ""Jess is a fat girl"". She tweeted: ""My weight has no relevance to either the performance I gave in that or in The Prime Of Miss Jean Brodie."" I’m shocked you got this. Excellent work on calling it out. Don’t think I’ve *ever* seen a Theatre review mentioning a man’s body in this way. xxx Coughlan questioned how the publication could continue to support his fat-shaming, and said Mr Fisher is ""not welcome to review any show I am in from now till forever. And I plan to be in a lot of damn shows"". She also asked Mr Fisher if she could ""cruelly review"" his body and post it online. The British Theatre Guide has apologised to Coughlan, saying the ""offending words have been removed"". ""While the reviewer may not have intended to offend, he accepts that it is not acceptable to use such descriptions in a review and not BTG policy,"" it said. You’re incredible in this production. Ace response to that reviewer! Coughlan called it ""a bit of a tepid apology"" but said she will accept it if they ""never review another woman's body again"".

2018-06-17,"Sir Christopher Chope and Philip Davies, who between them have used disruptive tactics on two new private members' bills, loathe many backbench bids to reform the law and see it their moral crusade to challenge them.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180617210717/https://news.sky.com/story/why-mp-sir-christopher-chope-objected-to-making-upskirting-a-criminal-offence-11406015,"Two of the most prominent figures on the libertarian Right of the Conservative Party, the pair regard many private members' bills as politically correct, nanny state nonsense seeking to meddle in people's lives and curb their personal freedom. In their latest challenge, first Mr Davies made a 148-minute speech on a Labour MP's bill to tackle the use of force against mental health patients. Then, Sir Christopher blocked a Lib Dem MP's bill to make ""upskirting"" a criminal offence by objecting to it. It only needs one MP to shout ""object"" to halt the progress of a fairly uncontentious private members' bill which had been expected to go through ""on the nod"". The result is that it goes to the back of the queue for private members' bills. And so that is now the fate of Lib Dem MP Wera Hobhouse's Voyeurism (Offences) Bill, which has government backing and proposes making it illegal for offenders to take a picture under someone's clothing without their consent. Sir Christopher, 71, is described by The Times Guide to the House of Commons as an ""abrasive carrier of the Thatcherite flame"". He's a climate change sceptic, once referred to Commons staff as ""servants"" and voted against same-sex marriage. MP for Christchurch, where a third of the residents are over 65, he is a former chairman of the Thatcherite campaign group, Conservative Way Forward, at whose dinner last week Boris Johnson made his notorious ""let Donald Trump negotiate Brexit"" speech. Sir Christopher was still on his feet in the Commons when the debate on Labour MP Steve Reed's Mental Health Units (Use of Force) Bill ran out of time at 2.30pm, which meant it had been ""talked out"" and prevented from progressing. Seconds later, when Deputy Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle named Ms Hobhouse's bill, which most MPs expected to be approved without a vote, Sir Christopher shouted ""Object!"", prompting shouts of ""Shame!"" from MPs on both sides of the Commons. Mr Reed's bill toughens the law on restraining mental patients and also requires police to wear body cameras while carrying out restraint, unless there are legitimate operational reasons for not doing so. In recent years, Sir Christopher has objected to numerous private members' bills, including: :: Safeguarding wild animals in circuses:: Protecting police dogs from being stabbed:: National standards for taxi licences:: Banning fraudulent wearing of medals:: Giving 6th formers better career advice Before Mr Chope spoke, Shipley MP Mr Davies, 46, spoke for nearly two-and-a-half hours, in what some MPs saw as a deliberate filibuster, even though Commons rules dictate that this is unparliamentary. As Mr Davies's speech hit the two-hour mark, the Liberal Democrat former health minister Norman Lamb said: ""I have a very real concern - and I don't think it's his intention, but I hope it isn't - that we could end up this being talked out today, and the risk then that this bill is lost."" When I spoke after the debate to Mr Davies, whose long speech meant there was only nine minutes for the Bill's third reading, he insisted he was not attempting to block the mental health bill but trying to improve it. But he is a self-appointed crusader against political correctness and the nanny state and is a scourge of well-meaning ministers and backbenchers whom he regards as ""do-gooders"" and ""busybodies"". During his speech, he said: ""We are in danger of passing a piece of legislation that everybody in this House knows is not as good as it should be and not as good as it could be, largely because of the paralysis of decision making within the government. ""I suspect that the civil service appear to have taken the government hostage in the running of public policy."" Calls for PM to act as Tory MP blocks upskirting law He later added: ""I think the Department of Health is one of the worst offenders for being taken hostage by its civil servants and I'm being charitable by saying that. ""I presume that's the reason why we get so many socialist, nanny-state proposals coming from the Department of Health. ""I can't believe the ministers can actually believe in all that rubbish, so it must be the civil servants who are running the department."" Mr Davies has considerable form, however for long speeches during Friday sittings when private members' bills are debated and time is limited. He has argued that his motive is to ensure bills which sound well meaning but are badly drafted do not get waved through without proper scrutiny. He once spoke for 77 minutes against proposals designed to help end violence against women and on another occasion used a speech of more than 50 minutes to help kill off a move to make first aid education compulsory at secondary schools. There have been many calls for a change in the Commons rules to prevent just one MP sabotaging a Bill by shouting ""Object!"". But that would face fierce backbench opposition, led - inevitably - by Sir Christopher and Mr Davies."

One of the supporters, Chris Clarke, 48, from Staffordshire, said he was ""a bit worried"" about going to Russia but soon realised it was an ""amazing place"". ""It's so clean, so friendly and everyone is really polite,"" he said. ""Everyone's coming up to me asking me where I'm from. I've seen about 10 England fans, there's more Russians in England shirts. ""Yesterday I wasn't wearing my England shirt and no one came to me - today everyone is coming to me and welcoming me to Russia."" The football fan, who was in Marseille during at the European Championships, was worried there could be a repeat of the violence which marred the 2016 tournament. When asked if he was nervous about wearing his England shirt, Mr Clarke said: ""Yesterday yes, today not at all - straight on this morning. ""I was in Marseille - it wasn't good at all. But I've spoken to Russians in the last two years and they've said that's not what Russia is like. And I believe them."" Another fan, David Inniss, 52, from Cornwall, said Volgograd was ""absolutely brilliant"" and that the people there were ""really nice"". Martin Barnes, also from Cornwall, said he was a ""little bit"" concerned about reports of potential violence. He added: ""We travelled over not wearing our colours, but everyone else is so we thought why not. ""We just want to represent our country. The excitement is a lot greater than the anticipation.""

There were cries of ""shame"" in the Commons on Friday as Sir Christopher blocked the legislation, which was proposed by Liberal Democrat MP Wera Hobhouse and supported by ministers. Sir Christopher said: ""The government has been hijacking time that is rightfully that of backbenchers. ""This is about who controls the House of Commons on Fridays and that's where I am coming from. I actually support the bills that were before the house. Four of the 26 bills that fell at the same time were my own.

But the MP said the reaction had been unfair. ""I feel a bit sore about being scapegoated over this,"" Sir Christopher said.

After the legislation was blocked, Prime Minister Theresa May said she was ""disappointed"" it did not progress, adding: ""I want to see these measures pass through parliament - with government support - soon."" She reiterated this on Sunday, telling the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that she would give time for anti-upskirting legislation to go through parliament on government time. Gina Martin, 26, launched a campaign to criminalise upskirting after two men took a picture up her skirt while she was at a festival in 2017. She is due to meet Sir Christopher this week. Victims of upskirting have been found to be as young as 10 years old. Currently, victims in England and Wales are forced to seek prosecution through other legal avenues, such as outraging public decency or harassment. A specific law against upskirting already exists in Scotland."

Newquay Coastguard called it a ""complex cliff rescue"" as teams battled for about three-and-a-half hours through the night to rescue the boy. They believe he had been celebrating the end of exams when he fell down the blowhole. The holes, of which there are several along Cornwall's coast, are formed when a vertical fault in a cliff is widened by waves, allowing water pressure to escapes up through the hole. Padstow Coastguard was initially sent to the wrong blowhole and called for assistance as the crew travelled to the other side of the bay to the correct one. They lowered their ""cliff man"" down the hole with an Air Ambulance paramedic who stabilised the boy and placed him on a stretcher. A second cliff technician from Newquay Coastguard was then sent down and between them they decided it was safer to haul the boy up the hole instead of through the bottom to where a Padstow lifeboat crew was waiting in a boat. The coastguard helicopter, Rescue 924, then airlifted the boy to Royal Cornwall Hospital Treliske before the paramedic and first cliff technician were pulled up the cliff. Writing on Facebook, Padstow Coastguard, said: ""Excellent multi agency team work as always with a great result."" Newquay Coastguard added: ""The male was extremely lucky and believed not life threatening injuries [sic]. Fantastic teamwork."" Padstow and the surrounding coastline is popular with holidaymakers, with many British teenagers heading to the area to celebrate the end of exams. In April a 56-year-old walker suffered serious injuries to his head and back after falling 6m (20ft) down Round Hole at Trevone, the famous collapsed sea cave near Padstow. The man was rescued after his friends raised the alarm, with one staying with him before rescuers winched him out with a helicopter."

Joshua Kimmich tried his luck with an overhead kick, Julian Draxler saw a shot deflect over and substitute Marco Reus flashed a volley wide from a tight angle. Toni Kroos tried his luck with a curling shot from outside the box as Germany grew increasingly desperate before another substitute, Julian Brandt, cracked a fierce 20-yard shot that hit the outside of the left post. Mexico had a penalty appeal waved away when striker Javier Hernandez went down under a challenge from defender Mats Hummels, with the referee opting not to consult VAR. Germany's defeat has raised questions about the decision to leave Manchester City winger Leroy Sane out of the squad following his tremendous season with the Premier League champions. Spain in 2010 are the only team to lose their opening game and go on to win the World Cup. Attention now turns to England as they prepare for their opening World Cup fixture against Tunisia on Monday. On Sunday, the Three Lions squad arrived in Volgograd where they will play their first group game, with manager Gareth Southgate confirming he was told the players who will be in the starting 11. It comes as police officers across the UK are preparing for an increase in domestic violence during England's World Cup games. Several forces have joined the Give Domestic Abuse the Red Card campaign after research found domestic violence increased when England both lost and won matches during previous tournaments."
2018-06-17,Ant McPartlin's estranged wife has hinted at her heartbreak hours after it emerged he is dating his personal assistant - who his wife says was her friend.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180617210717/https://news.sky.com/story/ant-mcpartlins-estranged-wifes-heartbreak-as-he-reportedly-finds-new-love-11407504,"Make-up artist Lisa Armstrong, 41, tweeted an image of two broken hearts and a whole heart just after 5am on Sunday. Just hours before, it was revealed McPartlin - one half of presenting duo Ant and Dec - is believed to be seeing Anne-Marie Corbett, his 42-year-old personal assistant. On Sunday afternoon, in reply to English glamour model Nicola McLean's concern for her, Armstrong said ""she was MY friend!!"". Yeah My Friend and OUR Pa who I let into OUR home. 💔 https://t.co/1eMqN4mjyu In reply to a fan, she also said ""my friend and OUR PA who I let into OUR home"". His wife, who is still going through divorce proceedings with him, also revealed she only found out they were dating through the media, and not from McPartlin. The TV presenter, 42, has reportedly been supported by Corbett over the past few months since he crashed his car while drink driving in Mortlake, southwest London in March. He was fined £86,000 and given a 20-month driving ban, prompting him to get help in rehab. Corbett, who has two young children, has been described as ""his rock"", showing up at the police station when he was arrested and in court when he received his ban in April. ""He's had a tough time of it, but Anne-Marie has put a smile back on his face again. She has been his rock,"" a source told The Sun on Sunday. ""They have been living in each other's pockets, day in, day out. ""Knowing someone is there for him has brought him back from the brink - she's put him back together again. ""It's very early days, but everyone is hoping he can put the worst year of his life behind him and find happiness again. Both of them deserve it."" McPartlin and his wife, who do not have any children, were together for 24 years and married for 11 years before filing for divorce in January. Their relationship is said to have suffered after he became addicted to painkillers following knee surgery. They both work on Britain's Got Talent and it is assumed they will continue to, although Armstrong is no longer working on Saturday Night Takeaway, presented by her estranged husband and co-presenter Declan Donnelly. Corbett separated from her husband Scott in October last year, with sources stressing McPartlin was nothing to do with her marriage break-up."

But when he got home and his mother read the messages she noticed some racist slurs had been written in between the names. Ms Ryan told Sky News: ""He came through the door, he was bouncy and really happy it was his last day at school. ""I looked at the back of his shirt and underneath the neck area it had the N-word written on it. ""It had coon written on it twice and then it had 'go back to the jungle' written on it. ""He was distraught, he's traumatised. ""I was quite upset because it's racial hatred, it's racial discrimination, it's against the law."" Ms Ryan, who is chief executive of equalities charity Working Action Group, said she was so upset she was crying, but she pulled herself together for a meeting with the headteacher. He was ""sincerely apologetic and said he was going to take it very seriously"". She added that her son had suffered from racism before at the school but she felt those incidents were not taken ""as seriously as I thought they should have been"". ""I don't think they were dealing with the undercurrent and overt racism my son suffered from for almost three years,"" she said. ""We feel like it's going back in time, I faced severe racism when I was at school, also in Essex, and its affected me in more ways than one."" With tears falling down her face, she said: ""Racism needs to be eradicated and it's not fair on my son. It hurts so much."" Ms Ryan says she has reported the incident to the police, who have recorded it as a hate crime. Sky News has contacted the school for a comment."
2018-06-17,'Knicker bunting' has been strung across the constituency office of an MP who blocked the progress of a proposed law against upskirting.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180617210717/https://news.sky.com/story/upskirting-row-knicker-bunting-demo-against-mp-sir-christopher-chope-11407418,"Three pairs of pants were hung in front of Sir Christopher Chope's office front door in Christchurch, Dorset. Their owner, Lorna Rees, is one of the veteran Tory MP's constituents. Upskirting is the practice of taking a picture up someone's skirt without them knowing. ""No one should be able to photo my pants unless I want them to,"" Ms Rees wrote on Twitter, along with a picture of her underwear. Her ""small protest"" had been ""flung together in anger and haste"", Ms Rees said, adding that ""Friday was desperately frustrating"". ""I hope my anti-Chope constituency pant protest shows solidarity,"" she wrote, referencing Gina Martin, who launched a campaign to make upskirting illegal. The Voyeurism (Offences) Bill was stopped in its tracks when Sir Christopher objected to it being given a second reading in parliament. The bill, which was proposed by Liberal Democrat MP Wera Hobhouse and supported by ministers, had been expected to get the nod through the Commons. Theresa May said she was ""disappointed the bill didn't make progress"", adding that she wanted to ""see these measures pass through Parliament - with government support - soon"". ""Upskirting is an invasion of privacy which leaves victims feeling degraded and distressed,"" the Prime Minister said. I’ve made a small protest of knicker bunting outside my MP Christopher Chope’s constituency office #upskirting #Chope #shame #christchurch #knickerstochope #upskirtingbill ‘no one should be able to photo my pants unless I want them to’ pic.twitter.com/y5vjnpncpK Former minister Sir Christopher was heckled with cries of ""shame!"" as he shouted an objection moments after the bill was called. Fellow Tory MP Alec Shelbrooke described him as ""a dinosaur, pure and simple"". But after the parliamentary session, Gina Martin and her lawyer Ryan Whelan spoke to Sir Christopher, who agreed to meet them to discuss the bill. ""I'm positive and hopeful that he will become a supporter,"" Ms Martin said. Sir Christopher has a record of blocking private members' bills and has moved to block a number of bills that have significant public backing."
2018-06-17,"Sir Christopher Chope may not be on Twitter, but the 71-year-old Conservative MP's name was trending on Friday night after he decided to single-handedly block a bill to make upskirting a criminal offence.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180617210717/https://news.sky.com/story/tory-dinosaur-damages-party-image-as-mp-blocks-upskirting-bill-11406719,"But it was not just social media that went into meltdown over his actions - the Conservative Party was in a tailspin, too. Sir Christopher's colleagues knew all too well the damage this would do. ""Don't underestimate just how furious many Tory MPs are about this,"" tweeted Paul Masterton, a new MP who is 39 years Sir Christopher's junior. ""This kind of thing does far more damage to the public's view of our party than endless debates about customs arrangements."" Beyond SW1, people do not care - or even understand - much about the ins and outs of Brexit policy, but they do understand - and care about - social issues that perhaps touch their lives or speak to the kind of society they live in. That is why Tories' missteps on dementia, fox hunting and ivory trade hurt them in the 2017 election and why this furore over upskirting is so worrying for them now. The bill called for taking photos up somebody's skirt without permission to be made illegal. MPs have publicly and privately sidelined Sir Chris as a politician of yesteryear. He's a ""dinosaur"" from a ""different century"" who has ""stayed too long"" on the Tory benches. They are telling him to apologise, some are even muttering that the prime minister should withdraw the whip. In his defence, his objection to the Private Member's Bill on upskirting was not a defence of the practice itself - there are reports that Sir Chris does not even know what it is - but rather an objection in principle to the use of Private Members' Bills to pass laws. Sir Chris has made it his life's work to block these bills on the basis that opposition parties should not be able to write government laws. Of course this is the sort of arcane debate over parliamentary procedure that means little to women - and men - furious that upskirting has not been made a criminal offence. They do not see an MP arguing a point of procedural principle; what they see a 71-year-old man allowing this awful crime to go on unchecked and a Tory Party that is out-of-touch with modern Britain. The prime minister, her ministers and MPs have scrambled to contain the fallout and will certainly push through legislation to ban upskirting in the coming weeks. But in a social media age, she will know that the damage has almost certainly now been done. Perhaps it is time to retire the dinosaurs."

2018-06-22,"Straight people care more about animal rights than equality between people of different races, genders or sexualities, a new survey has claimed. ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180622154128/https://news.sky.com/story/straight-people-care-more-about-animal-rights-than-gay-equality-11412661,"A poll issued by the organisers of London Pride revealed a huge gap between the priorities of LGBT+ people and those of their heterosexual counterparts. Of those straight people who are not trans who were surveyed, only 3% said they were concerned about tolerance for individuals with different gender identities or sexualities, 2% were worried about gender inequality, and 6% were worried about racism. Less than half - 49% - completely agreed that people in the LGBT+ community had the right to live their life as who they are without fear of judgement or prejudice. Half of LGBT+ Londoners have been victim of a hate crime. We’ve come a long way, but there’s a way to go. #PrideMatters as much as it ever has done. pic.twitter.com/MYc3YfCBKh Conversely, 44% of LGBT+ people said they were worried about tolerance for people of different sexualities and gender identities, and 22% said they were worried about gender equality. London Pride questioned straight people who are defined as cisgender - meaning they identify with the gender they were assigned at birth - and LGBT+ people. Chairwoman of Pride in London, Alison Camps, said: ""Our research shows that, although many in this country may think LGBT+ people have achieved equality, the reality is that we are by no means 'equal'. ""Together with our straight allies, we see it as our collective responsibility to challenge harmful attitudes across society and highlight the reality that LGBT+ people face in all aspects of their lives."" While straight cisgender people were unconcerned about gay rights, the survey showed that LGBTQ+ people are still vulnerable to abuse and discrimination. The report found that one in three LGBT+ people surveyed had been verbally abused because of their identity within the last year, and 44% felt threatened by others. Among LGBT+ people, 5% said animal rights were a concern while 7% of straight cisgender people said they were worried about it. The survey asked respondents to pick the three issues they were most concerned about, from a selection of 15 topics including crime, education, animal rights and terrorism. Around 2,000 people from each group were quizzed about their priorities. LGBT+ people and straight cisgender people did converge on some issues, however. Similar numbers from both groups said they cared about the NHS, the environment and Britain leaving the EU. A significantly higher percentage of straight cisgender people also said they were worried about crime and terrorism compared to those in the gay community."
2018-06-22,Janie Hamilton's son James died aged just 36 when he refused to have chemotherapy for testicular cancer after years battling mental illness.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180622154128/https://news.sky.com/story/cannabis-is-to-blame-for-my-sons-death-the-drug-should-not-be-legalised-11410986,"His death was recorded as being partly caused by schizophrenia, which his family believe was triggered by his addiction to cannabis from the age of 14. Here, Mrs Hamilton from North Dorset, warns that the dangers of the drug are being forgotten following Lord Hague's call for the UK to legalise marijuana for recreational use. As a child, James was a fun-loving, mischievous boy with a great sense of humour. He was a brilliant writer and dreamed of being a journalist. It was only after he began smoking cannabis when he was 14 that his behaviour became erratic. We had no idea he using cannabis until he was about 15. James went to stay with his aunt with a couple of his friends, who we think introduced him to the drug. She caught James smoking and told my husband who later confronted him. James was always extremely truthful and never lied so he would admit using cannabis. But it didn't stop him. He used it whenever he could get hold of it. He went to university, where he was using cannabis all the time, but dropped out after one term because he couldn't cope. For the next six months he was living with us and his behaviour became increasingly bizarre. He became obsessed with his appearance. He bleached his hair, then shaved his hair off. He shaved his eye brows and cut his eye lashes. He stripped his bedroom of everything apart from a futon. He believed he was going to be the head of the SAS and the president of the United States. One day, when James was 20, he spent all night turning in circles saying: ""I'm free, I'm free"", while waving his arms. It was then that I had to call a doctor and James was sectioned - but on his first day on the ward he got hold of cannabis again. James would go on medication and get better, then come off medication and do something bizarre which meant he was sectioned again. It was a cycle for 16 years. We're not sure when he was diagnosed with testicular cancer because he didn't tell us at first. He was in a mental hospital at the time. We finally found out when James visited Richmond Park, one of his favourite places, with my husband and said: ""I've got the big C."" My husband was stunned but James didn't seem fearful. He didn't think he was going to die. The consultant made it as clear as possible for him but it made no difference. James was out of touch with reality because of the effects of his cannabis use. It's absolutely devastating because he didn't need to die. A Sky Data poll has revealed a rise in the number of Britons who think cannabis for medicinal use should be legalised. It was a very treatable form of cancer and he could still be here today. My husband and I went out for a walk with James to try to persuade him to have treatment but he still refused. It had no impact on him. Near the end of his life I was allowed to move into the hospice caring for James. I told him he was the best son I could have ever had and he said I was the best mother he could have ever had. He passed away in the hospice's courtyard on 31 July 2015. As a family, we're still dealing with the ongoing devastation. I still cry. There's disbelief that he's gone because his cancer was so treatable. After our experience, I was angry seeing William Hague call for cannabis to be legalised. A politician - or anyone else, for that matter - who has not lived, first hand, through someone addicted to the drug, has no perception of the devastation it causes. We're all made differently. There will be young people who have used cannabis like James did and got away with it. But the make-up of some people makes them more susceptible to mental illness. While I accept cannabis oil should be allowed for medicinal purposes, I'm concerned that the dangers of drugs are being forgotten. William Hague may perhaps think it would glamorise the Conservative Party but it's not glamorous on the streets or in mental hospitals. If people had witnessed what I had for 16 years in mental health wards, with patients young and old shuffling about, their lives derailed, they would not be so casual about the potential impact of cannabis on individuals."
2018-06-22,Grammy-nominated artist Akon is planning to build a futuristic city in Senegal and base its entire economy around a new cryptocurrency named after himself.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180622154128/https://news.sky.com/story/akon-to-build-real-life-wakanda-with-its-own-cryptocurrency-in-senegal-11411642,"The multi-platinum-selling music producer unveiled the ambitious project at a creative festival in Cannes, where he spoke at a panel titled Branding Africa: Blockchain, Entrepreneurship and Empowering the Future. According to page six, he told an audience at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity that his proposed cryptocurrency - dubbed AKoin - could be ""the saviour of Africa in many ways"" because of how secure it would be. It would all be based on a mobile app, which he said would allow citizens of Akon Crypto City ""to utilise it in ways where they can advance themselves and not allow government to do those things that are keeping them down"". According to the official AKoin website, the 45-year-old - who has founded two successful record labels - has already been gifted 2,000 square acres of land for his planned city by Senegalese President Macky Sall. The website describes it as a ""real life Wakanda"" - the hi-tech fictional African nation which served as the backdrop for Marvel's award-winning Black Panther, which took more than $1.3bn at the box office after its release in February. In the film, Wakanda combines lush river valleys and mountain ranges with space-age technology, featuring towering skyscrapers and state-of-the-art science labs. Akon - who was born in Missouri but is of Senegalese descent and spent much of his childhood there - envisions his city and its bespoke currency allowing ""brands, businesses and high-profile individuals to do amazing things"". It would be just a short drive from the capital of Dakar and apparently will boast homes, shops, parks, universities, schools and even its own stadium. But Akon admitted he is only involved in the envisioning of the project, with him happy to ""let the geeks figure it out"" when it comes to making it a reality. And his ambitions do not stop there, as during the same panel he also put his name forward as a potential US presidential candidate in 2020. The Don't Matter singer said he was hoping to ""go after"" both Donald Trump and rapper Kanye West, who has also expressed an interest in running for office in future. ""It's perfect, a masterplan,"" he reportedly said."
2018-06-22,"The senior auditor who signed off BHS's accounts days before its sale by Sir Philip Green backdated his audit opinion and spent just two hours working on the file, according to an explosive memo from his former employer.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180622154128/https://news.sky.com/story/banned-bhs-auditor-spent-two-hours-signing-off-retailers-accounts-11411768,"Sky News has obtained an email written by Kevin Ellis, the UK‎ chairman of PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), which catalogues failings by Steve Denison, who had been responsible for auditing BHS and Taveta Investments, the holding company for Sir Philip's Burton-to-Top Shop high street empire. The bombshell note sent to nearly‎ 1,000 partners at PwC is heavily critical of Mr Denison's conduct. Last week, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), which regulates audit firms and accountants, effectively banned Mr Denison - a 30‎-year PwC veteran - from the profession for 15 years, and fined him £500,000. As Sky News revealed six days ago, Sir Philip is challenging details of the FRC's full report on the auditing of BHS and Taveta, with a hearing due t‎o take place at the High Court later on Thursday. In his email to ‎partners, Mr Ellis described Mr Denison's supervision of the audit work as ""inadequate"". ""He was responsible for the overall quality of the audit, supervising the audit and issuing the auditor's report. ""He failed to carry out these responsibilities appropriately, delegating too much work to a junior team member and only recording two hours of work during the completion stage."" Mr Ellis said that Mr Denison backdated his audit opinion‎ that BHS was a going concern by three days, compounding this misconduct by making ""a false statement on the audit file relating to the circumstances of the backdating"". The PwC chief added that while this did not have an impact on the audit opinion itself, ""neither of these actions is acceptable"". In addition to Mr Denison's fine and ban, PwC itself was hit with a £10m penalty - reduced to £6.5m because it agreed to an early settlement - for its failings. Among the other flaws in the BHS and Taveta audit oversight highlighted by Mr Ellis were: :: A failure by Mr Denison and PwC to ""consider or identify the risk of threats to their objectivity and independence, such as a non-audit fee: audit fee ratio of up to 8:1"". :: ‎An insufficient gathering of evidence ""as to whether BHS was a going concern in circumstances where we knew BHS was about to be sold"", and a failure by the firm to request documentation produced by Taveta about the department store chain's going concern status. :: Not properly dealing with the carrying value of an investment in BHS and a loan to BHS which had been waived. Mr Ellis said his email would make ""uncomfortable reading"" for colleagues. ""This situation should not have happened and we need to face up to the failings and learn the lessons,"" he wrote. Mr Ellis added that the legal tussle sparked by Sir Philip meant there were restrictions on the details he could share about the case. Taveta's application for a judicial review marks a rare, although not unprecedented, challenge to the FRC. It is the latest in a series of legal fights arising from the demise in 2016 of BHS, which crashed into administration with the loss of about 11,000 jobs. Sir Philip agreed last year to pay up to £363m into BHS's pension scheme to end the threat of action against him by the pensions watchdog, and has faced no further action from the Insolvency Service. Dominic Chappell and other directors of his vehicle, Retail Acquisitions, are still mired in regulatory probes and legal proceedings brought by various bodies, including the Insolvency Service and Pensions Regulator, in connection of his purchase of BHS. The imposition of what effectively constitutes a lifetime ban for Mr Denison - who also chairs Yorkshire County Cricket Club (CCC) - has sent shockwaves through the UK's accounting profession.‎ Mr Denison was among the witnesses called to give evidence to an inquiry by MPs into BHS's collapse in 2016. He told a hearing in May that year that there had been valid reasons for signing off BHS's accounts with a ""going concern"" opinion shortly before Mr Chappell bought the retailer. ""The existing management team was trying to turn the business around, and had some success in driving costs down and reducing cash requirements; the cash requirements were lower than the losses shown; and there was a deal which would bring extra cash from the vendor and new cash from the purchaser. ""Compared with the plans, there was no material uncertainty."" ‎ The record fines imposed on Mr Denison and his former employer came almost two years to the day after the FRC launched its probe into the audit of BHS. Sir Philip had sold the chain for £1 to Mr Chappell, a three-times bankrupt, barely a year earlier. The scale of the punishments for PwC and Mr Denison has raised questions about the FRC's motives at a time when its future is being scrutinised as part of a government-commissioned review. Greg Clark, the business secretary, asked Sir John Kingman, the former Treasury mandarin, to examine whether the FRC is fit for purpose following growing disquiet about apparent conflicts of interest and the pace of its enforcement inquiries. Frank Field, the Labour MP who co-chaired a joint select committee inquiry into BHS's collapse, wrote to PwC this week seeking further information about the firm's audit of BHS and Taveta. PwC and the FRC declined to comment on Thursday, while Sir Philip could not be reached.‎"
2018-06-22,A court in California has heard the 911 call made by a 17-year-old to tell police about the years of abuse she and her 12 siblings allegedly suffered at the hands of their parents.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180622154128/https://news.sky.com/story/teens-911-call-details-abuse-of-torture-parents-at-turpin-family-home-in-california-11411843,"In the call the girl tells the dispatcher to ""help my sisters"" as she gives details of their squalid house with a suffocating stench, where they were shackled to beds and choked by their parents. The children's parents David and Louise Turpin have pleaded not guilty to torture, child abuse and other charges. Louise Turpin dabbed her eyes with a tissue as the recording was played during a preliminary hearing to decide if the couple should face trial. The girl is heard saying two younger sisters and a brother were chained to their beds and that she could not take it any longer. ""They will wake up at night and they will start crying and they wanted me to call somebody,"" she said in a high-pitched voice. ""I wanted to call y'all so y'all can help my sisters."" The 911 call in January marked a new start for the 13 Turpin offspring - aged two to 29 - who lived in such isolation that some did not even understand the role of the police when officers arrived at the house in Perris, 70 miles (113km) southeast of Los Angeles. Two girls, 11 and 14, had been hastily released from their chains when police showed up, the court heard, but a 22-year-old son remained shackled. The man said he had been tied up with ropes at first and then, after learning to wriggle free, restrained with increasingly larger chains on and off over six years. Children were deprived food and had no toys or games but were allowed to express themselves in journals which were seized by investigators. Some suffered from severe malnutrition and muscle wasting, said investigator Patrick Morris. An 11-year-old girl who was shackled to a bed had arms the size of an infant and a 12-year-old girl could not recite the alphabet, the court heard. The oldest of the siblings weighed just 5st 8lb (37kg). Most of the Turpin children were home schooled, but one of the older boys was allowed to attend classes at a local college. His mother would drive him there, stay outside in the hallway during the class and then take him back home as soon as the class ended, prosecutors said. The girl planned her escape for two years and was terrified as she climbed out a window to freedom, Riverside County Sheriff's Deputy Manuel Campos testified. ""She couldn't even dial 911 because she was so scared that she was shaking,"" he said. The teenager did not know the neighbourhood and had to read her address to the dispatcher off a piece of paper. The children were rarely allowed outside, though they went out on Halloween and travelled as a family to Disneyland and Las Vegas, they said. ""Sometimes I wake up and I can't breathe because of how dirty the house is,"" the girl told the dispatcher. She said she had not bathed in a year and Deputy Campos said he observed dirt caked on her skin and a smell from being unwashed. The Turpins are being held on $12m (£9m) bail each. The current whereabouts of the children is unknown. Jack Osborn, a lawyer appointed to represent the couple's seven adult children, said earlier this year that they were ""doing well""."

""I've never been in since I lived there,"" Sir Paul says. It is now a National Trust property. As they look around, Sir Paul says one of the downstairs rooms is where ""me and John would often come to rehearse or to write"". Sir Paul sits down at the piano and plays When I'm 64.

Corden, who reckons it is ""quite possibly the best Carpool Karaoke we've done so far"", says it is something he will ""never ever forget""."
2018-06-22,"The Windrush generation has ""gifted Britain"", a service to commemorate the 70th anniversary of their arrival has heard.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180622154128/https://news.sky.com/story/windrush-generation-has-gifted-britain-70th-anniversary-service-told-11413399,"The service at Westminster Abbey was led by the Rev Canon Joel Edwards, who said those who arrived at Tilbury Docks on 22 June 1948 showed resilience as they helped rebuild post-war Britain, often in the face of adversity. Mr Edwards, addressing a congregation including members of the Windrush generation and their children, hailed the positive impact they have had in politics, business, music and food. He said the Windrush generation had ""gifted Britain"", providing trade union leaders, politicians and senior civil servants. However, he addressed their hardships, saying those who left the Caribbean for a new life in Britain faced racism. He said: ""Settling down hasn't been plain sailing. The children of Windrush have experienced over-representation in Britain's prisons and mental health institutions, knife crimes, underachievement in education and the job market. ""Settlement has meant racism, sometimes too much policing and not enough protection. And Stephen Lawrence."" The murdered black teenager's mother Doreen, now Baroness Lawrence, attended the service. Prime Minister Theresa May also attended the service. Her government has been criticised over a scandal that has seen people who were invited here decades ago now facing deportation. Mrs May enjoyed the gospel choir, clapping and swaying as they sang wearing the red, green and yellow of the Caribbean. Sajid Javid was also at the service, after he took over as home secretary from Amber Rudd who resigned over the scandal. John Richards, 92, who came to Britain on the Windrush aged 21, described the service as ""great"". Asked if he found it emotional, he said: ""It brings back memories yes, but I'm too old for the emotion."" The fallout from the deportation scandal continues. This week the Home Office announced that former chief crown prosecutor Wendy Williams will oversee the Windrush lessons learned review. Dubbed the Windrush generation after the cruise ship that brought one of the first large groups of West Indians to Britain, anyone who entered the UK before 1973 is legally entitled to live in the country. But recent changes to UK immigration law saw some of those who came to Britain run into problems over new requirements for documentation when working, renting property or accessing benefits."
2018-06-22,"Emily Thornberry, who controversially mocked the England flag just after the last World Cup, has tried to make amends by proposing a bank holiday if England reach the final this time.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180622154128/https://news.sky.com/story/labours-thornberry-calls-for-bank-holiday-if-england-reach-world-cup-final-11412554,"Labour's shadow foreign secretary was sacked from a frontbench role by Ed Miliband for a 2014 tweet which appeared to sneer at St George's flags draped on the home of a white van man. Now she says the day after the World Cup final should be a Bank Holiday if England play in it, although she admits she is not a football fan and mistakenly thinks the tournament is held every five years. Mr Thornberry's attempts to win over football fans - and white van men - came in a speech to political journalists at Westminster at which her hosts had placed England flags in front of her and behind her. In a further move to woo support from football fans during the World Cup, she also attacked the Royal Mail for banning postmen from flying England flags on their vans, urging bosses to reconsider. And, during her speech and Q&A, Ms Thornberry also accused Theresa May of making dishonest statements in a TV interview - and then was honest enough to admit that she had smoked cannabis ""a long time ago"". It was during a by-election in Rochester and Strood in 2014, after Tory MP Mark Reckless defected to UKIP, that Ms Thornberry tweeted a photo of a house with three England flags and a white van parked outside. Fearing a backlash from working class voters, an embarrassed Mr Miliband immediately fired the barrister MP from her post as shadow attorney general and insisted Labour had respect for ""white van man"". Now, apparently full of remorse, Ms Thornberry told her Westminster audience: ""This is one of the things about the World Cup, that we do get lots of flags out and I think there is nothing wrong with that. ""Actually in Islington we have the additional thing of not only lots of England flags but lots of other flags as well, because we have a community that has flags of all different sorts."" Then she said: ""I can't pretend that I have the greatest interest in football, and I suspect that there's quite a lot of people like that. ""But I tell you how you could get more interest in football. ""What about if the government were to suggest, for example, that if one of the nations of the United Kingdom were to get into the finals … the next day will be a bank holiday? ""Why don't we do that every five years (sic) and that would help to get everybody behind whichever team it was?"" Labour is already proposing four new UK bank holidays, on St David's Day (1 March), St Patrick's Day (17 March), St George's Day (23 April) and St Andrew's Day (30 November). So Ms Thornberry is proposing a fifth new public holiday. Attacking dishonesty in politics, she criticised those Labour MPs, such as pro-Remain campaigner Chuka Umunna, who have rebelled against Jeremy Corbyn on Brexit, accusing them of wanting to overturn the EU referendum result. ""I'm not saying that everyone who was arguing in favour of the EEA [European Economic Area] were people who actually just want to stay in the European Union, because I think some people genuinely feel that the government are doing such a bad job in the negotiations that they need to have a safe port,"" she said. ""But I think there were other people who were voting for it because it was a cover because actually what they want is to remain and there was a little bit of wrecking. ""I want to remain in the European Union, but I'm going to do as I'm told and I'm going to do everything that I can to make sure we get as good a deal as possible. ""But there are others who want to remain in the European Union and who are sometimes allowing themselves to indulge in things that are not realistic and who know that they're not and that's what's dishonest."" And accusing Mrs May of dishonesty, Ms Thornberry said: ""Just look at the prime minister who, in the space of one interview last Sunday, claimed that she would fund a £20bn boost on NHS spending primarily through the 'Brexit dividend'. ""She claimed that the Brexit transitional period would definitely finish at the end of 2020. She claimed that she had not misled Dominic Grieve and Anna Soubry on the 'meaningful vote' amendment. ""And after all that she had the sheer chutzpah to say - and I quote - that she is a woman of her word."" And so, when she was asked if she had smoked cannabis, she said: ""Yes I have but it was a long time ago and I think the nature of cannabis has changed quite a lot. ""It was something that I thought should be legalised but, as an MP, it's a good example of how you can be educated by your constituents."""
2018-06-22,"A lot has been said and written during the last decade about how the macho, testosterone-charged working environment in the City and on Wall Street contributed to the financial crisis by encouraging reckless risk-taking.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180622154128/https://news.sky.com/story/goldman-sachs-to-invest-500m-in-firms-owned-by-women-11410985,"Undoubtedly there is an element of truth to that, while the recent revelations in the Financial Times about the President's Club dinner also led to many 'Sexism in the City' headlines, even if the event was attended largely by people working in the commercial property sector rather than in financial services. Scratch beneath the surface, though, and there is growing evidence that leading financial institutions are trying hard to address issues such as the gender pay gap and to push for gender equality in the workplace. Yet not only is there a gender pay gap, there is also a gender investing gap, which some leading institutions are now seeking to tackle. The latest example is Goldman Sachs, which has just set aside $500m that it intends to invest in companies that are led, founded or owned by women. The initiative, called Launch With GS, will also provide seed capital for female investment managers who are setting up their own funds. Stephanie Cohen, chief strategy officer at Goldman, said women-led businesses did not seem to be getting the investment they deserved. She said only 2% of US venture capital in 2017 went to companies with all-women founding teams and just 12% to teams with at least one woman, while fewer than 2% of US private equity firms were female-owned. She added: ""Whether these dismal numbers are due to poor sourcing, lack of supply or outright bias, or some combination thereof, the end result is clear: picture a founder or CEO in your mind, and it's probably a man. ""Investing in women entrepreneurs with great ideas will help, but it's going to take a lot more than just smartly directed dollars."" Launch With GS is the second initiative Goldman has carried out in this field but the previous one, 10,000 Women - which provided capital and business education to female entrepreneurs in emerging markets - was a philanthropic venture, while this time the bank hopes to make money from its investment. Ms Cohen added: ""Our goal with Launch With GS is to generate strong investment returns. The bottom line is this makes sense for our business - because investing and helping companies grow is our business. ""We also hope it makes a difference for women who have big ideas but find themselves cut out of the funding ecosystem."" Goldman Sachs is not the only organisation trying to cut the gender investment gap. The fund manager Legal & General Investment Management recently launched the L&G Future World Gender in Leadership UK Index Fund, known as the 'GIRL Fund' for short, which aims to improve gender diversity standards across business by allocating a higher weighting in its fund to companies with more women on its board, its executive team, in its management and in its workforce There have for a number of years been venture capital firms looking to back female-led start-ups, such as Monarq, a New York-based incubator fund that also puts female entrepreneurs in touch with potential mentors. This, though, has been a niche area until now. The arrival of players like LGIM and Goldman Sachs, backing their ideas with serious sums of money, suggests backing women-led businesses is about to enter the financial mainstream."

A former deputy director of the prime minister's residence is also charged in the case. Mrs Netanyahu has long faced allegations of abusive behaviour and living extravagantly in a manner out of touch with the general public. The PM also faces several police investigations into alleged corruption. In one case, he and family members are suspected of receiving $285,000 (£215,000) worth of luxury cigars, champagne and jewellery from wealthy personalities in exchange for financial or personal favours. In the other case, investigators suspect the premier of trying to reach an agreement with the owner of Yediot Aharonot, a top Israeli newspaper, for more favourable coverage. Mr Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing, dismissing the accusations against him and his wife as a media witch-hunt. He also faces suspicions of government favours that allegedly saw regulatory breaks go to Israel's largest telecom firm Bezeq, in return for favourable coverage of him and his wife by a news website. Despite his troubles, opinion polls suggest Mr Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party would remain the largest in parliament if elections scheduled for November 2019 were held now."

It began its progress to becoming law in the Commons on Thursday afternoon. Sky News understands a second reading for the bill will take place at some point before the summer recess next month. Prime minister Theresa May said: ""Upskirting is a hideous invasion of privacy which leaves victims feeling degraded and distressed. ""I am proud that the Government has today introduced a Bill in the Commons which will make this a criminal offence."" Campaigners celebrated the news, telling Sky News: ""We've done it"". Gina Martin, a 25-year-old freelance writer, began the push to make upskirting a specific criminal offence after having photographs taken of her underwear without her permission at a festival. Ms Martin said she was ""hurt and angry"" after backbencher Sir Christopher Chope blocked a backbench bill to ban the practice. But now that the government has adopted the bill, she said Sir Christopher's intervention was simply a ""bump in the road"". Ms Martin told Sky News: ""It feels weird to know I've changed the law. It's all I've thought about for a year. ""I've dreamt about it, I've dreamt about that moment with Chris Chope for the past five days. It was my life. In a world we’re we only share our strengths and highlights, I thought I’d post the video I shared with my boyfriend the moment I found out the Gov. were tabling a Government Bill to outlaw #upskirting.That bill is being tabled today. It’s been a long, hard road getting here. pic.twitter.com/IfqiHXsEGY ""So the idea that it's over, that we've done it, doesn't compute yet. ""When it's on the statute books and we can use it, then I'll probably cry for about a week."" Ms Martin's campaign has had cross-party support in the Commons and was supported by the government. But it was momentarily stopped in its tracks when Sir Christopher shouted ""object"" at a debate last Friday. Only one MP needed to do so to delay the legislation. A massive backlash ensued, including strings of underwear being hung up outside the Christchurch MP's constituency and Westminster offices. He later defended his actions, saying he did support the legislation but that the way it was being introduced - not in government time - was worthy of the ""Putin era""."

Here are some of the others... :: BMW The German car manufacturer weighed in last year, when its head of purchasing called Brexit a ""very uncomfortable scenario"". It was among a group of major European firms last month to warn that ""time is running out"" in negotiations. BMW, along with BP, Nestle and Vodafone, told Prime Minister Theresa May a trade deal with the EU must be ""frictionless as with a customs union"". :: Deutsche Bank Up to 4,000 workers could be moved from London to Frankfurt, a senior executive from Deutsche Bank warned last year. Its chief regulatory officer said ""we really need clarity"" and that staff had ""real questions"", such as: ""Where do I register my children for in the next two years at school?"" Another executive, the head of Deutsche's capital market division in Germany, later said they thought ""not thousands but rather hundreds"" would be relocated from Britain to Germany. :: Chubb US insurance giant Chubb announced it would relocate its European headquarters from London if the UK left the customs union. It has not directly criticised the government, but said it had been ""encouraged by the assistance and cooperation provided by the French government as we have considered our post-Brexit options"". :: Rolls-Royce The car manufacturer's chief executive called last year for ""as little change as possible"" as he warned against a ""hard"" Brexit. It came days after Chancellor Philip Hammond confirmed the UK would pull out of the single market and customs union. :: Nissan Japan's second-biggest carmaker may have expanded operations in Sunderland following secret assurances given by ministers, but it teamed up with Toyota and the Japanese ambassador to head to Downing Street for more talks in February. The diplomat warned afterwards that: ""If there is no profitability of continuing operations in the UK - not Japanese only - then no private company can continue operation. ""It is as simple as that.

The shops earmarked for closure, including its flagship Oxford Street store in London, will remain open until early 2019. House of Fraser secured the backing of more than 75% of creditors, including landlords. It was approved despite anger among landlords, who have complained that they are being forced to take a financial hit while House of Fraser enjoys new investment. Alongside the CVA, Hamleys owner C.banner is being lined up to buy a 51% stake and invest £70m into the remainder of the business. Landlords berated the chain's management and their advisers at KPMG over how the CVA was conducted, complaining that their share of the vote had been structured unfairly in an attempt to push through the restructuring proposal. A representative for two of House of Fraser's landlords said there had been ""no give"" from the top team. The company's boss, Alex Williamson, had warned that the move represented the ""last viable"" option to save the retailer, with the group at risk of collapse had the CVA been rejected. There are also plans to relocate its Baker Street head office and the Granite House office in Glasgow to help cut costs and secure its future. The closures can be attributed to rising costs and business rates, competition from online rivals and a slowdown in consumer spending."
2018-06-22,Campaigner Christie Elan-Cane has lost a High Court action against the government's policy on gender-neutral passports.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180622154128/https://news.sky.com/story/campaigner-loses-bid-for-gender-neutral-passports-11413060,"Elan-Cane has been fighting for ""X"" passports for people who define as neither ""M"" nor ""F"". The campaigner argues the ""denial of existence is the worst act of discrimination by the gendered majority against the non-gendered"". Elan-Cane believes the current passport forms are discriminatory, but a judge who heard arguments in the case in London in April dismissed the judicial review action today. During the April proceedings, Elan-Cane's lawyers challenged the lawfulness of the policy administered by Her Majesty's Passport Office, which is part of the Home Office, arguing that it breaches human rights laws. Mr Justice Jeremy Baker said although he was not at present satisfied that the current policy is unlawful, part of the reasoning for that decision was that a comprehensive review has not been completed. Elan-Cane's lawyer, Kate Gallafent, argued the policy breaches Article 8 - the right to respect for private life - and the right to not be discriminated against on the basis of gender or sex, under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). 'X' PASSPORTS JUDICIAL REVIEW: I'm extremely sorry to say that today's judgment ruled HM Government's refusal to issue 'X' PASSPORTS was not unlawful. The good news is that ECHR Article 8 was triggered and sets a new precedent. I will update LiveJournal later today. ""For the claimant, obtaining and using a passport currently involves making a false declaration as to the nature of the claimant's gender identity, which causes the claimant considerable distress,"" she said. ""The lack of a non-gender specific passport option impacts on the claimant's ability to obtain and use a passport on equal terms with persons who identify, and are identified, solely in terms of male or female."" She told the judge the impact of the passport office's refusal to provide for ""X"" passports ""affects not only non-gendered persons such as the claimant, but a broad section of the public"" - including intersex and transgendered people and other individuals with gender dysphoria. After the ruling, Elan-Cane tweeted: ""I'm extremely sorry to say that today's judgment ruled HM Government's refusal to issue 'X' PASSPORTS was not unlawful. ""The good news is that ECHR Article 8 was triggered and sets a new precedent."" James Eadie QC, on behalf of the government, argued that if the policy constituted an interference with Article 8 it was justified by the need to maintain an administratively coherent system for the recognition of gender, to maintain security and to combat identity theft and fraud, and to ensure security at national borders."

2018-06-22,"Philip Hammond has angrily denied that he and the Treasury are ""the enemy of Brexit"", while pouring scorn on claims that a £20bn boost for the NHS will be funded by a ""Brexit dividend"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180622154128/https://news.sky.com/story/chancellor-philip-hammond-treasury-and-i-are-not-enemy-of-brexit-11412696,"In his Mansion House speech in the City of London, the chancellor said the proposed NHS cash injection would only be ""partly funded"" by reduced contributions to Brussels and that taxes would have to go up. And in remarks that will further anger pro-Brexit Cabinet rivals, Mr Hammond vowed that the Treasury would be a ""champion of prosperity"" after Britain leaves Europe by protecting trade, maintaining open markets and co-operating on regulation. Mr Hammond's defence of his Brexit strategy will be seen as a direct counter-attack against Boris Johnson, who claimed in a leaked speech two weeks ago that the Treasury was ""basically the heart of Remain"". But the chancellor told his City of London audience: ""Of course, the immediate key to maintaining Britain's leadership in innovation and strengthening London's position as the world's leading international financial services centre is ensuring we get a good Brexit deal and that we protect markets from uncertainty during the transition. ""Our clear long-term goal is to secure an enduring partnership that reflects the four and a half decades that the UK has been a member of the EU. ""That recognises that our European neighbours are our most important trading partners and that Dover to Calais is the busiest trading corridor in Europe, that our peoples are connected by centuries of shared history and culture. ""And that the security of our entire continent depends on our shared commitment to defending it - through our collaboration every day on intelligence, counter-terrorism, and defence. ""So as we leave the EU we need to forge a new relationship with our European neighbours that protects those patterns of trade, those business relationships that have been painstakingly built over decades, that maintains low friction borders and open markets. ""That does not make the Treasury, on my watch, ""the enemy of Brexit"", rather, it makes it the champion of prosperity for the British people outside the EU, but working and trading closely with it. ""And part of that successful future partnership must be a mechanism that enables UK EU financial services trade to continue, delivering the benefits of open markets and deep regulatory co-operation."" Mr Hammond added: ""The UK will continue after Brexit to lead and influence international thinking on the regulation of financial services - and we will do so as the hosts of a global financial centre. ""But we will all be stronger and have more influence in shaping the global debate, if we and our EU neighbours remain closely connected. It is Mr Hammond's reference to ""open markets and deep regulatory co-operation"" that will most antagonise Brexiteers like Mr Johnson, Michael Gove and Jacob Rees-Mogg, who will claim he is attempting to keep the UK in a customs union with access to the EU's single market. In his leaked speech on 6 June , Mr Johnson warned of keeping the UK ""locked in orbit around the EU, in the customs union and to a large extent still in the single market, so not really having full freedom on our trade policy, our tariff schedules, and not having freedom with our regulatory framework either"". And the foreign secretary claimed that outcome was being pushed particularly by the Treasury and would mean the UK had left the European Union without taking back control over its own affairs. On the extra cash for the NHS, Mr Hammond conspicuously failed to use the phrase ""Brexit dividend"" used by Theresa May and confirmed the extra NHS cash would not be funded by more government borrowing but by tax rises likely to hit the better off. ""This week, the PM announced a five-year NHS funding package that will boost spending on health by over £20bn a year in real terms in England alone, partly funded by lower contributions due to Brussels,"" said the chancellor. ""Making the NHS our number one priority in the forthcoming spending review. But, she also confirmed we will stick to our fiscal rules and will continue to reduce debt. ""So, as the prime minister said, taxpayers will have to contribute a bit more, in a fair and balanced way, to support the NHS we all use, while delivering on our fiscal commitments."" Yet in a TV interview on Sunday, Mrs May said, referring to Vote Leave's controversial red bus: ""Some people may remember seeing a figure on the side of a bus a while back of £350m a week in cash. ""Well, I can tell you what I am announcing will mean that in 2023-24, there will be about £600m a week in cash, more in cash, going into the NHS."" She added: ""Now, of course we've got to fund that, that money. That will be through the Brexit dividend, the fact that we're no longer sending vast amounts of money every year to the EU once we leave the EU. And we as a country will be contributing a bit more."""
2018-06-22,"The quality of our clothing and temperature we use for washing could be contributing to a rise in moth infestations, according to a pest killer firm.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180622154128/https://news.sky.com/story/why-more-of-your-clothes-are-being-ruined-by-moths-11412824,"Call-outs to moth infestations have increased by more than 110% from April to May and by 60% over the last four years, Rentokil said. Some 59% of people prefer to buy high-quality clothes in the hope they will last longer and 54% are more likely to wash their clothes at 30C now than they were five years ago, according to the company's survey. But higher-quality clothes are often made with natural materials, such as wool and silk. These materials contain the protein keratin, the preferred food for moth larvae. The larvae can only be killed when clothes are washed at 55C. David Cross, from Rentokil, said: ""May's unseasonably warm temperatures and the early start to summer has helped to create the perfect conditions for moths to breed and potentially thrive in British households. ""With a prolonged breeding season, clothes and soft furnishings in British homes could be at increased risk to damage caused by moth larvae feeding on the natural fibres they contain. ""Washing clothes at high temperatures or having them dry cleaned are practical methods to help remove moth larvae from clothing."" Some 13% of people have had a moth problem in their home, according to the Rentokil survey. Last year, English Heritage launched operation clothes moth after its experts witnessed the numbers of common or webbing clothes moths double. Members of the public were asked by English Heritage to monitor moths in their homes to help the charity look after its collection of historic wool carpets, tapestries and period clothing. Thousands of traps were handed out at English Heritage sites for the survey which collected data from 42 counties. It discovered the reported catch of the common clothes moth was significantly higher in London and the South East, where an average of 23 moths were found per trap - more than anywhere else in England. Higher and older pre-1950s properties were found to have more moths because they have more voids, fireplaces and attics than newer homes. Flats or apartments are also more susceptible as they have shared walls. Tips for preventing clothes moth infestations include checking for moths in the creases, folds and behind labels of clothing, keeping items in vacuum bags, and taking out items from the wardrobe and giving them a good shake at least once a month to disturb the moths."

Mr Hands, MP for Chelsea and Fulham, confirmed he would honour a pledge to oppose Heathrow expansion after it was confirmed Tory MPs would not be allowed a free vote. He wrote on Twitter: ""As the government will be whipping the vote on Monday, this means I am resigning from the government. ""It has been an honour to serve the prime minister (and her predecessor) for the last seven years and I wish the PM & the government every continuing success."" Downing Street said Mr Hands had ""served the government with great ability and distinction over several years, and we thank him for all of his work"". A spokesman added: ""This government is committed to expanding airport capacity at Heathrow - this is an important decision which will play a crucial role in securing the future of global Britain."" The government's determination to proceed with a third runway presents a number of Conservatives with a difficult decision. Not least Boris Johnson, who once pledged to ""lie down in front of the bulldozers"" if a third runway was given the green light. However, there is confusion over whether the foreign secretary will even be in the country for the vote. There are suggestions the former London mayor might attend a meeting of European Union foreign ministers instead - a convenient scheduling clash that would avoid a torturous decision for Mr Johnson. But a written ministerial statement tabled on Thursday says Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan will be going. The waters were further muddied when Sky News contacted the Foreign Office press office to ask the department if it could confirm who will be attending - and they said they did not know. Labour's shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said: ""Greg Hands's resignation piles the pressure on Boris Johnson who promised his constituents he would 'lie down in front of the bulldozers' to stop a third runway. ""Instead he is jetting off to Luxembourg on Monday to avoid the vote because he is too weak to stand by his promises. ""Labour opposes a third runway at Heathrow because it doesn't meet our four tests and we are calling for a free vote for all parties on Monday."" Officials say a third runway will lead to 114,000 extra jobs around the airport by 2030. Aviation minister Baroness Sugg said: ""A third runway at Heathrow would bring benefits of up to £74bn to passengers and the wider economy, creating tens of thousands of local jobs in the process. ""It is easy to take these benefits for granted but our latest illustration, showing expansion would create enough jobs to fill well over 600 passenger jets, spells out just what MPs will be voting for. ""This massive project will bring fantastic opportunities for UK businesses, workers and apprentices and we cannot afford to wait any longer to push ahead with it."""
2018-06-22,A 12-year-old girl was on the phone to emergency services for nearly an hour as she was trapped inside Grenfell Tower with the fire taking hold.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180622154128/https://news.sky.com/story/grenfell-inquiry-hears-desperate-999-calls-11412344,"Emergency 999 calls were played out on the latest day of the inquiry into the tragedy - including that of Jessica Urbano Ramirez, who left her family's flat on the 20th floor to seek shelter at the top of the tower three storeys above. She is one of 72 people who died in or as a result of the fire. Jessica made the 30th call to the emergency services that evening, and was on the phone with call handlers for 55 minutes, the inquiry was told. It came after the testimony of Behailu Kebede, who lived in flat 16, where the fire started. The 45-year-old was woken just before 1am on 14 June by the sound of his smoke alarm, and found white smoke billowing from behind his fridge-freezer. He alerted his housemates before knocking on his neighbours' doors and rushing outside barefooted. :: Grenfell fridge fire resident 'was terrified for his life' after being 'hounded' Within two minutes of the occupants leaving, the first firefighter entered the building. The inquiry was played CCTV from the hallways, including footage of Mr Kebede's neighbour Almaz Kinfu grabbing a suitcase on her way out of the building. Mr Kebede's statement explained how he and his neighbours had been worried about the quality of the window refit in their flats, and had written to their MP and the council. He said air would enter his flat through the kitchen window. Builders were sent to fill the gaps with sealant, which the inquiry heard was flammable. Experts believe the fire escaped through the gaps in Mr Kebede's window. He said he had ""no idea"" about highly flammable cladding being installed on the side of the tower block. The Uber driver, who had lived in the block since 1991, said he had been happy to move into the flat, and described the tower as a ""melting pot"" of cultures. He had bought the fridge-freezer that caught fire several years ago for about £275. He said he heard no explosions and saw no flames in his flat on the night of the fire. ""While I was standing outside I saw the fire get bigger and bigger,"" he said. Mr Kebede left the area, but returned later that evening. ""We walked back to the tower on foot,"" he said. ""When I got there the whole tower was engulfed by an inferno on all four sides. ""It was terrifying. It was much worse than before."" :: Grenfell inquiry sees footage of source of the fire Mr Kebede said police had wanted to put him in witness protection after it was incorrectly reported that he had tampered with his broken fridge-freezer and somehow caused the fire. He turned down the offer but has had to live in different hotels for his own safety. He said he lives in fear that people may want to hurt him, and that he wished he had died in the tower with the victims. CCTV images were shown of the outside of the flats as the flames spread. The inquiry also heard from a firefighter who spotted the flames spreading from the fourth floor, but was told by a superior not to spray them with water. A report from the London Fire Brigade, marked with a time of 1.06am, states that a firefighter named as Watch Manager Dowden noted that ""the fire has breached the window of flat 16"". It adds: ""[Crew Manager] Secrett advises him not to at this point due to the risk to BA Team One who are about to enter the flat."" Within minutes, the fire spread through the cladding, the inquiry heard."

2018-06-22,"People with iPhones are unable to fully use the app designed to help EU citizens register to stay in Britain after Brexit, the home secretary has admitted.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180622154128/https://news.sky.com/story/javid-admits-issue-with-eu-citizens-iphone-app-as-details-of-settlement-system-revealed-11412267,"Sajid Javid said officials were working with Apple to rectify the problem, which he said has been caused by the company's technology. iPhone users are unable to use the app to read the chip on their passport and submit a selfie to help prove their identity, unlike those on other devices. Applicants will be able to complete the process in other ways, but the glitch is an unwelcome headache for the Home Office. The problem was outlined as Mr Javid described how EU citizens already in the UK can apply to stay. ""With a non-Apple phone, in most cases, you will be able to download an app which if you put your passport next to your phone it will be able to download that information, send it to us straight away through the app,"" Mr Javid told a House of Lords committee. ""And then you take a picture of yourself, a selfie ... you download that too and it will match that with the information that's downloaded from the chip, put it together and it will confirm your ID electronically."" Mr Javid added that by giving a National Insurance number which can be cross-referenced with HMRC records, applicants will be able to prove their residence in the UK without the need to submit any paperwork. ""We would like that to work for everyone, whatever smartphone device they have got, but we don't control their own software, their hardware,"" he said. The home secretary said hundreds of extra officials are being employed to help deal with the new settlement system. ""I don't under-estimate the scale of the challenge, I do recognise that. Nothing like this has been done by the Home Office before,"" Mr Javid said. ""That said, ever since the vote to leave, and certainly the triggering of Article 50, the Home Office has been preparing for this."" MPs question how Windrush generation could be placed in deportation centres after providing years of payslips and contributions The settlement scheme applies to any EU citizen who wants to remain living in Britain after the end of the Brexit transition period in December 2020. There are an estimated 3.8 million EU nationals currently in the UK. Citizens' rights is one of a number of issues that needs to be sorted out as part of Britain's exit from the bloc. The first people are expected to apply within weeks. Under Home Office plans, the online platform will be attempt to process a small number of real cases at the end of the summer, with a phased roll-out of the scheme beginning later this year. Applicants will be required to pay £65 - the same as the current cost of a permanent residence document and £10.50 less than the minimum cost of a standard British passport. It will cost £32.50 for children under 16 and there will be no charge for those who already have permanent residence documents. It is envisaged the scheme will be fully operational by 30 March 2019, the day after Britain officially leaves the EU, with the final deadline for applications coming at the end of June 2021. EU citizens and family members who have been in the UK for five years by the end of 2020 can apply for ""settled status"", which means they have indefinitely leave to live and work here. Those who arrived by 31 December 2020 but have not been in the UK for five years can seek to stay until they have, at which point they can apply for settled status. The Government expects applications to be processed within two weeks, but officials are hopeful they can be dealt with with in a matter of days. On Wednesday, Mr Javid accused the EU of neglecting the post-Brexit rights of UK ex-pats living in Europe, claiming the EU's preparations were ""not good enough""."

They were left fighting for their lives after being found unconscious on a park bench, but have since been discharged from hospital. Charles and Camilla met workers at pop-up market stalls next to where the bench, which has been removed, used to be. They also spoke to people from The Maltings shopping centre. Before entering Guildhall Square, where they were greeted by hundreds of people waving union flags, the couple walked past the Zizzi restaurant where the Skripals ate. ""I think their visit is very important - it boosts morale and (will) hopefully bring people back to the city. We need tourists to survive,"" said Jessica Fulton, who lives and works in Salisbury. Superintendent Dave Minty, who co-ordinated the initial response to the Skripal incident, said the ""brilliant"" visit emphasised that ""we are doing the right thing and Salisbury is recovering"". The acting dean of Salisbury Cathedral, Canon Edward Probert, said he was ""grateful and glad"" the couple had visited a city which has ""shown considerable resilience and resolve"". Some 250 detectives have gone through more than 5,000 hours of CCTV and interviewed more than 500 witnesses. The government has accused Russia of being behind the attack - but Moscow has repeatedly denied any responsibility."

Rounding up six of his comrades in November 1951, he gathered a pile of grenades and led a series of charges against North Korean and Chinese soldiers. Despite suffering injuries to his leg and shoulder, he battled on to repel the enemy. Having run out of grenades he resorted to throwing beer bottles in a heroic bid to protect his comrades and allow them to withdraw safely. ""You just do what you're trained to do as a soldier,"" he said. ""We did what we had to."" The Victoria Cross is awarded for gallantry ""in the presence of the enemy"". King George Vl awarded him the honour but died before an investiture could take place. ""When I got it the king was alive but he was very ill,"" Mr Speakman said. ""So the Queen - I was her first VC. It was a wonderful moment. I think she was nervous and I was very nervous,"" he told the Royal British Legion. Prior to his death, Mr Speakman was one of only 10 living people who had been awarded the VC, which was first presented by Queen Victoria in 1857. On Remembrance Sunday last year, he was accompanied by another holder of the award, Johnson Beharry, who won his VC for bravery in Iraq in 2004. Mr Speakman, a father of seven born in Altrincham, Cheshire, also served in Italy, Greece, Malaya and Borneo. Between 1945 and 1970 he was in the Black Watch, the Argyll and Southern Highlanders and The King's Own Scottish Borderers. He later became a Chelsea pensioner. The Victoria Cross Trust said it was ""extremely sad"" to hear of Mr Speakman's death. ""Our thoughts and prayers go to his family and friends at this sad time,"" it added."

Among the things being looked at are the carbon, resource use and water footprint of clothing during its life cycle. Ideas for how to recycle clothes and reduce waste and pollution will also be considered. Mary Creagh, chair of the environmental audit committee, said: ""Fashion shouldn't cost the earth. ""But the way we design, make and discard clothes has a huge environmental impact. ""Producing clothes requires toxic chemicals and produces climate-changing emissions. ""Every time we put on a wash, thousands of plastic fibres wash down the drain and into the oceans. ""We don't know where or how to recycle end-of-life clothing. ""Our inquiry will look at how the fashion industry can remodel itself to be both thriving and sustainable."" According to a 2015 report from the British Fashion Council, the UK fashion industry contributed £28.1bn to national GDP, up from £21bn in 2009. But the globalised market has encouraged a ""fast fashion"" phenomenon where clothing is cheap and, therefore, easily disposed of and repurchased. Making clothes requires land and water as well as fossil fuels, chemical dyes, finishes and coatings, some of them toxic. Some of the fibres used in clothes can pollute our oceans and rivers, entering the food chain. There are also environmental issues when clothing is disposed of, with some ending up in landfill or dumped in overseas markets.

Among its findings, the inquiry concluded Mr Carby had been given the powerful drugs ""without appropriate clinical indication"". Here, Mr Carby's daughter Cindy Grant explains why she is hoping a police investigation will be launched to bring ""justice"" over her father's 1999 death. My dad was a jolly, happy, loving man. He was always up for a laugh, singing to his grand-kids with a smile on his face. He was the life and soul of the party. Trying to get justice for him over so many years has been a rollercoaster of emotions. It's heartbreaking. The day before he died, he was sat up in bed and seemed in good spirits, asking my aunt and uncle to place a bet on the horses for him. The next morning, we had a phone call saying he had taken a turn overnight. When my sister and I arrived at the hospital, he had been moved to a private room. He was unconscious. Dr Barton told us she suspected he had suffered another stroke and that we should ""let nature take its course"". She said she would make him comfortable with a syringe driver of morphine and midazolam, a powerful sedative. We didn't ask any questions. She was the medical professional so we accepted what she said. My family were distraught. We were in shock seeing my father like that. The hospital staff wanted to give me an injection to calm me down but I refused. We asked why we weren't contacted in the night. Why hadn't he been transferred to another hospital? After my father passed away, Dr Barton signed the cause of death as a cerebrovascular accident - a stroke. But other doctors, nurses and pharmacists have told us the last thing you give to a stroke patient is morphine with midazolam. We know what Jane Barton did was wrong. She was very abrupt, cold and uncaring. There was no emotion on her face whatsoever. It is a farce that she was never struck off and I'm hoping the outcome of the report leads to her prosecution. My mum was very poorly before she passed away in 2007 and my sister promised her we would keep fighting. After the pain and anguish that we, and other families, have been through, we are going to get justice. :: Hampshire Police concluded in 2006 that no-one would face prosecution over the deaths of patients at the hospital after a four-year inquiry. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said at the time that negligence could not be proven to a criminal standard and that there was no realistic prospect of conviction of healthcare staff. :: In 2010, the CPS announced that no criminal charges were to be brought against Dr Barton after finding there was insufficient evidence to mount a prosecution for gross negligence manslaughter in 10 key cases."

The clip also reportedly shows England fans singing an anti-Semitic song in a bar in Volgograd. The Football Association has condemned the actions in the video and now detectives are looking to identify two of those involved. The event took place in a southern Russian city which was the venue of England's 2-1 win over Tunisia on Monday. Volgograd was formerly known as Stalingrad, where one of the bloodiest battles in history occurred when Soviet soldiers pushed back Hitler's army during the Second World War. Detective Superintendent Caroline Marsh, UK police investigations lead for the World Cup, said: ""The abhorrent behaviour seen in this video is completely unacceptable and it will not be tolerated. It follows a Russian MP urging Russian women to get together with visiting football fans and have children during the tournament. ""Our investigation team in the UK is already making swift inquiries to identify those involved and will seek to take all appropriate action against them."" Sky News understands that although the UK police have no powers in Russia, they are thought to be working with the Russian police and could pass on any relevant information to them. The UK police will also be checking to see if any action will need to be taken upon the men's return to Britain. This could be, for example, if any of the men are in breach of a banning order which prevents them from flying overseas for games. On Wednesday, a spokesman for the FA said: ""We strongly condemn the actions of the people in this video. ""We are working with the relevant authorities, including the UK police investigations team, who are making inquiries to identify the individuals involved and take appropriate action. ""The disgraceful conduct of the individuals in this video does not represent the values of the majority of English football fans supporting the team in Russia."""

It follows an admission by immigration minister Caroline Nokes that the government has not reached a decision on a compensation scheme more than two months after it was raised by MPs. The Home Office call for evidence on the Windrush compensation scheme closed two weeks ago, but a full consultation on details of the scheme has not yet been announced and Mr Javid has not confirmed when it will be introduced. ""Today, as we mark the 70th anniversary of the arrival of HMT Empire Windrush, many of our fellow citizens have been left destitute by the Home Office and the government's hostile environment policy,"" said Ms Abbott. ""They cannot wait months for a consultation to be concluded on the government's promised compensation scheme. ""The Home Office's hostile environment policy has left British citizens in debt, jobless, denied access to the benefits to which they are entitled and even homeless. ""The home secretary must act to urgently establish a hardship fund to support these people ahead of the promised compensation scheme, which will clearly not be up and running for months. ""The home secretary is dragging his feet and has failed to even confirm when the compensation scheme will finally be set up. ""This is totally unacceptable. ""If the home secretary is to keep his promise to put this crisis right then he needs to act now."" In May, Mr Javid launched a month-long call for evidence as ""the first step to establishing"" a compensation scheme for ""those who have suffered financial loss because of difficulties proving their immigration status"". But last week Ms Nokes told MPs: ""We have not decided any details of the scheme."" Ms Abbott has now highlighted several stories of hardship involving people from the Windrush generation: :: Balvin Marshall, 64, came to the UK in 1972. After years of working and paying his taxes he was told he was here illegally and could not work. He had to leave his job as a council road sweeper and lost his home. He is homeless and has been sleeping on park benches. He told The Guardian: ""At this moment I have no address. Where I sleep tonight, I am yet to work out."" :: Anthony Bryan, a painter and decorator, lost his job when he was told he was in the country illegally. Mr Bryan has lived in the UK since 1965. He estimates that he has spent £3,000 on legal and application fees and owes £5,000 in overdue council tax and loans. He has been placed in immigration detention twice, and has had his car removed by bailiffs. :: Sarah O'Connor moved to Britain 51 years ago when she was six and has lived here ever since. She was challenged to prove she was here legally when she was applying for benefits after losing her job. Although she has successfully interviewed for several new jobs, the offers were withdrawn when employers discovered she has no passport. Unable to get work and told she is not eligible for benefits, she built up debts and earlier this year was facing bankruptcy. :: Hubert Howard, 61, arrived in the UK 58 years ago with his mother and has not lived anywhere else since. He was told he was an illegal immigrant and consequently he lost his job and was unable to get a British passport to travel to Jamaica to visit his mother before she died. Unable to work, he was told he was not entitled to benefits and as a result has accumulated substantial debts. :: Judy Griffith arrived in the UK in 1963. After 52 years, a Jobcentre Plus employee told her that she was an illegal immigrant and, because her passport with evidence of leave to remain had been stolen, she was unable to work.

She fell into significant arrears on her flat and narrowly escaped eviction, but still owes thousands of pounds to Islington Council. Also calling on Mr Javid to launch a hardship fund is the home affairs select committee of MPs, which says citizens have suffered financially because of difficulties proving their immigration status.

2018-06-23,A sexual assault charge against former television presenter John Leslie has been found not proven by a court in Edinburgh.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180623112057/https://news.sky.com/story/sexual-assault-charge-against-former-tv-presenter-john-leslie-not-proven-11413561,"The 53-year-old walked free from the court after the verdict - which means there was insufficient evidence to establish guilt or innocence. He was accused of putting his hand down a woman's trousers and touching her bottom as they danced at an Edinburgh nightclub last June during what was the alleged victim's hen night. Leslie, appearing under his real name John Stott, had denied the charge, which was found not proven by Sheriff Adrian Cottam on Friday after a two-day trial. The Sheriff said it had been a ""difficult decision"" as the evidence from the bride-to-be ""on its own appears to be a credible and reliable account"". He said taking the case as a whole the evidence from the defence ""adds up to a combination of factors"" that caused reasonable doubt. Outside the court Leslie said: ""CCTV and DNA prove no assault took place. It is time to move on from this year of hell."" His father Les Stott, who was with Leslie, reacted with fury when reporters asked about the ""not proven"" verdict. He shouted: ""It doesn't leave any doubt, he is innocent, absolutely, positively innocent."" While giving evidence during the case, Leslie said: ""There was no sexual assault. ""I did not put my hands down her trousers. It's something I would never do and have never done. I'm upset at the allegation."" He told the court she asked him to dance and he did so in a ""proper and very respectful manner"". He said once the dance ended she continued to dance with her friends ""as if nothing had happened"". Leslie said when police told him of the allegation he replied ""that's just not happened"" and told them to check the CCTV. He said he asked the owner of the club, Atik, to keep the footage and paid to have it enhanced, telling the court: ""I knew that I had done nothing wrong, I knew the allegations were false and I wanted every angle possible to show it."" His alleged victim, who cannot be named, earlier gave evidence and said Leslie put his hand down the back of her trousers and touched her bottom. She cried as she said she had nothing to gain by making up the allegation and it had affected her relationships with her friends and husband. Her friend also gave evidence and said she felt where Leslie had his hands was ""inappropriate"" and the bride-to-be looked ""scared"". The DJ that night gave evidence, saying Leslie had been a ""perfect gentleman"" while dancing with the bride-to-be. DNA experts said Leslie's DNA was found on the back waistband of the trousers but could have been transferred by indirect contact."
2018-06-23,Organisers of the Miss America beauty pageant revealed this month they are scrapping its swimwear segment and will no longer judge competitors on physical appearance.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180623112057/https://news.sky.com/story/swimsuit-model-contests-empower-women-they-must-not-be-scrapped-11413050,"Here, Poppy Haskell, who was crowned the winner of Miss Swimsuit UK, tells Sky News why she believes the event is empowering for women and that Miss America organisers are wrong. I strongly disagree with anyone who would call swimsuit modelling contests sexist. No one is forced into the competition and for the women taking part, it's empowering. It's sad that Miss America organisers have given into peer pressure by removing the swimsuit portion of their event. It was the same situation when Formula One stopped using grid girls - I should know because I was one of them! That job helped me pay the rent and allowed me to travel the world. It was an amazing opportunity. I met a lot of the F1 drivers and none of them had a problem with the grid girls. It was never a distraction and it added some ""razzle dazzle"" to race days. When I was growing up it was never my intention to be a model. I studied journalism at university but I soon realised an office job was not my calling. My move into the modelling industry came out of the blue. I was 18 years old and performing in a ballet show when someone from an agency spotted me. It led to some part-time modelling work but I have to admit I wasn't making a lot of money. I first heard about Miss Swimsuit UK through a close friend who had entered in 2015. It opened up a lot of opportunities for her so, in 2017, I decided to take the plunge and give the competition a go. My fellow contestants were from all sorts of backgrounds and there were plenty of different personalities. One woman worked in the navy, another worked in the pharmaceutical industry. Some women were shy, others were more confident. I took part in catwalks, wearing different swimsuits and answered questions from a presenter to give an impression of my personality. For me, the competition was a way of showcasing my gym work and healthy eating. The whole event was a celebration of the female form and for all the contestants, the event was about empowering each other. I didn't feel I was being judged in a negative way. I found it very liberating being in a swimsuit and people had worked hard to be able to enter the competition. To be named the winner was incredible. It was a massive boost to my confidence and it turned out to be the catalyst for my modelling career, which went into overdrive. I'm now modelling all over the world and hoping to move into TV presenting and producing. My parents - who both have corporate jobs - are immensely proud of me and my boyfriend has always been extremely supportive. The Miss America beauty pageant has announced it will no longer judge candidates ""on their outward physical appearance"". You have to set boundaries and I said to him from the start: ""This is my passion - take it or leave it."" I feel like I've finally found my niche in the industry. Having curves is great for swimsuit modelling. I'm not skinny and tall like a fashion model and I would never work as a glamour model because I wouldn't ever pose naked. Unfortunately though I've had a few bad experiences in the industry. There have been instances where male photographers have tried push me further than I wanted to go. It's definitely an issue in the industry. Thankfully I'm a strong-minded person who will always stand my ground. I think it's great that, with the #MeToo movement, more women are being vocal about standing up to this kind of behaviour. Women get demonised for all kind of things. But if all things are equal, where are the calls for men to stop performing topless in Magic Mike Live?"
2018-06-23,"Airbus has said it is running out patience with the government and a ""no-deal"" Brexit would mean ""chaos at the borders"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180623112057/https://news.sky.com/story/airbus-no-deal-brexit-would-be-chaos-at-the-borders-11413180,"The company employs 14,000 people at several sites including Bristol, Stevenage, Portsmouth and north Wales, but another 110,000 jobs are also vulnerable at firms supplying the aircraft maker. In one of the most significant interventions by a major manufacturer since the referendum two years ago, it published a ""risk assessment"" on its website saying it would ""reconsider its investments in the UK, and its long-term footprint in the country"" if Britain left the single market and customs union without a transition agreement. Speaking to Sky News, the company's senior vice president Katherine Bennett said: ""We would see it as chaos at the borders. ""Our parts move across the borders sometimes up to two or three times, perhaps going into a satellite that we build here in the UK or the wings that we make here in the UK. ""We don't want them to be affected by friction at the borders."" Ms Bennett said Airbus was ""running out of patience"". She said EU member states, as well as the UK, need to understand the importance of the way Airbus works. ""It's putting pressure on all sides, it's not just the UK,"" Ms Bennett said. ""We are an international business and the EU 27 need to understand the importance of integration and the way we work."" Airbus says the current planned transition period to December 2020 was too short for businesses to reorganise supply chains. Tom Williams, chief operating officer of Airbus Commercial Aircraft, said: ""In any scenario, Brexit has severe negative consequences for the UK aerospace industry and Airbus in particular. ""Therefore, immediate mitigation measures would need to be accelerated. ""While Airbus understands that the political process must go on, as a responsible business we require immediate details on the pragmatic steps that should be taken to operate competitively. ""Without these, Airbus believes that the impacts on our UK operations could be significant. ""We have sought to highlight our concerns over the past 12 months, without success. ""Far from 'project fear', this is a dawning reality for Airbus. Put simply, a no-deal scenario directly threatens Airbus's future in the UK."" The risk assessment says: ""A no-deal Brexit must be avoided, as it would force Airbus to reconsider its footprint in the country, its investments in the UK and at large its dependency on the UK. ""Given the 'no-deal/hard Brexit' uncertainties, the company's dependence on and investment in the flagship Wing Of Tomorrow programme would also have to be revisited, and corresponding key competencies grown outside the UK. ""This extremely negative outcome for Airbus would be catastrophic. ""It would impair our ability to benefit from highly qualified British resources, it would also severely undermine UK efforts to keep a competitive and innovative aerospace industry, while developing high-value jobs and competencies."" The warning has sparked claims that ""Project Fear"" - a term Brexit supporters use to refer to what they view as instances of scaremongering - has reared its head once more. John Longworth, co-chair of the campaign group Leave Means Leave, said: ""Airbus are claiming that they might relocate out of the UK because of uncertainty, but if we leave the customs union nothing will change as tariffs on aeronautical products are zero. ""They are also claiming that they may move production to countries outside the EU, which clearly can have nothing to do with Brexit. ""The best way to ensure certainty is to declare for WTO terms now and prepare to leave the EU in March 2019, an outcome companies like Airbus are fervently seeking to frustrate. ""No doubt we will see more of these scare stories over the coming months as multi-nationals seek to undermine the democratic decision of the British people in order to protect their own narrow, vested interests."" Downing Street insisted it had a ""good dialogue"" with Airbus and ""continues to speak to them"". A spokesperson said the business department was ""speaking with"" officials from the aerospace giant on Friday. Earlier on Friday, Number 10 defended the ""significant progress"" made in negotiations with the EU ""to ensure trade remains as free and frictionless as possible, including in the aerospace sector""."
2018-06-23,A hospital in the UK is to be the first to set up an NHS-funded internet addiction centre.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180623112057/https://news.sky.com/story/first-nhs-funded-internet-addiction-centre-11413889,"The west London centre will start in the next couple of weeks and be aimed at people with gaming disorders. Other internet-based addictions could be treated in future, however. Psychiatrist and clinic founder Henrietta Bowden-Jones said the centre will seek to provide treatment, do research and give advice to families. She told The Guardian: ""Gaming disorder is finally getting the attention it deserves. ""The distress and harm it can cause is extreme and I feel a moral duty on behalf of the NHS to provide the evidence-based treatment these young people and their families need. ""We are unlikely to witness an epidemic of young players with an addiction to gaming but for the ones who do struggle, the centre for internet disorders will be a life-changer."" My addiction is based on an insatiable need for information, writes Sky's Siobhan Robbins A spokesman for the Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust could not confirm the numbers of patients who are being signed up for treatment. The news comes after the World Health Organisation classified gaming disorder as an addiction, describing it as a pattern of persistent gaming behaviour so severe it ""takes precedence over other life interests"". Symptoms include impaired control over gaming and increased priority given to gaming. WHO said: ""Studies suggest that gaming disorder affects only a small proportion of people who engage in digital or video-gaming activities. ""However, people who partake in gaming should be alert to the amount of time they spend on gaming activities, particularly when it is to the exclusion of other daily activities, as well as to any changes in their physical or psychological health and social functioning that could be attributed to their pattern of gaming behaviour."" But experts criticised the move for making a hobby seem abnormal."
2018-06-23,"Home Secretary Sajid Javid is being accused of ""dragging his feet"" on compensation for Windrush citizens.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180623112057/https://news.sky.com/story/javid-dragging-feet-on-windrush-compensation-11412773,"The call is being led by the shadow home secretary Diane Abbott on the 70th anniversary of the arrival in the UK of the Empire Windrush ship. It follows an admission by immigration minister Caroline Nokes that the government has not reached a decision on a compensation scheme more than two months after it was raised by MPs. The Home Office call for evidence on the Windrush compensation scheme closed two weeks ago, but a full consultation on details of the scheme has not yet been announced and Mr Javid has not confirmed when it will be introduced. ""Today, as we mark the 70th anniversary of the arrival of HMT Empire Windrush, many of our fellow citizens have been left destitute by the Home Office and the government's hostile environment policy,"" said Ms Abbott. ""They cannot wait months for a consultation to be concluded on the government's promised compensation scheme. ""The Home Office's hostile environment policy has left British citizens in debt, jobless, denied access to the benefits to which they are entitled and even homeless. ""The home secretary must act to urgently establish a hardship fund to support these people ahead of the promised compensation scheme, which will clearly not be up and running for months. ""The home secretary is dragging his feet and has failed to even confirm when the compensation scheme will finally be set up. ""This is totally unacceptable. ""If the home secretary is to keep his promise to put this crisis right then he needs to act now."" In May, Mr Javid launched a month-long call for evidence as ""the first step to establishing"" a compensation scheme for ""those who have suffered financial loss because of difficulties proving their immigration status"". But last week Ms Nokes told MPs: ""We have not decided any details of the scheme."" Ms Abbott has now highlighted several stories of hardship involving people from the Windrush generation: :: Balvin Marshall, 64, came to the UK in 1972. After years of working and paying his taxes he was told he was here illegally and could not work. He had to leave his job as a council road sweeper and lost his home. He is homeless and has been sleeping on park benches. He told The Guardian: ""At this moment I have no address. Where I sleep tonight, I am yet to work out."" :: Anthony Bryan, a painter and decorator, lost his job when he was told he was in the country illegally. Mr Bryan has lived in the UK since 1965. He estimates that he has spent £3,000 on legal and application fees and owes £5,000 in overdue council tax and loans. He has been placed in immigration detention twice, and has had his car removed by bailiffs. :: Sarah O'Connor moved to Britain 51 years ago when she was six and has lived here ever since. She was challenged to prove she was here legally when she was applying for benefits after losing her job. Although she has successfully interviewed for several new jobs, the offers were withdrawn when employers discovered she has no passport. Unable to get work and told she is not eligible for benefits, she built up debts and earlier this year was facing bankruptcy. :: Hubert Howard, 61, arrived in the UK 58 years ago with his mother and has not lived anywhere else since. He was told he was an illegal immigrant and consequently he lost his job and was unable to get a British passport to travel to Jamaica to visit his mother before she died. Unable to work, he was told he was not entitled to benefits and as a result has accumulated substantial debts. :: Judy Griffith arrived in the UK in 1963. After 52 years, a Jobcentre Plus employee told her that she was an illegal immigrant and, because her passport with evidence of leave to remain had been stolen, she was unable to work. She could not visit her sick mother in Barbados in 2016, and was unable to attend the funeral. She fell into significant arrears on her flat and narrowly escaped eviction, but still owes thousands of pounds to Islington Council. Also calling on Mr Javid to launch a hardship fund is the home affairs select committee of MPs, which says citizens have suffered financially because of difficulties proving their immigration status.

2018-06-23,"A lot has been said and written during the last decade about how the macho, testosterone-charged working environment in the City and on Wall Street contributed to the financial crisis by encouraging reckless risk-taking.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180623112057/https://news.sky.com/story/goldman-sachs-to-invest-500m-in-firms-owned-by-women-11410985,"Undoubtedly there is an element of truth to that, while the recent revelations in the Financial Times about the President's Club dinner also led to many 'Sexism in the City' headlines, even if the event was attended largely by people working in the commercial property sector rather than in financial services. Scratch beneath the surface, though, and there is growing evidence that leading financial institutions are trying hard to address issues such as the gender pay gap and to push for gender equality in the workplace. Yet not only is there a gender pay gap, there is also a gender investing gap, which some leading institutions are now seeking to tackle. The latest example is Goldman Sachs, which has just set aside $500m that it intends to invest in companies that are led, founded or owned by women. The initiative, called Launch With GS, will also provide seed capital for female investment managers who are setting up their own funds. Stephanie Cohen, chief strategy officer at Goldman, said women-led businesses did not seem to be getting the investment they deserved. She said only 2% of US venture capital in 2017 went to companies with all-women founding teams and just 12% to teams with at least one woman, while fewer than 2% of US private equity firms were female-owned. She added: ""Whether these dismal numbers are due to poor sourcing, lack of supply or outright bias, or some combination thereof, the end result is clear: picture a founder or CEO in your mind, and it's probably a man. ""Investing in women entrepreneurs with great ideas will help, but it's going to take a lot more than just smartly directed dollars."" Launch With GS is the second initiative Goldman has carried out in this field but the previous one, 10,000 Women - which provided capital and business education to female entrepreneurs in emerging markets - was a philanthropic venture, while this time the bank hopes to make money from its investment. Ms Cohen added: ""Our goal with Launch With GS is to generate strong investment returns. The bottom line is this makes sense for our business - because investing and helping companies grow is our business. ""We also hope it makes a difference for women who have big ideas but find themselves cut out of the funding ecosystem."" Goldman Sachs is not the only organisation trying to cut the gender investment gap. The fund manager Legal & General Investment Management recently launched the L&G Future World Gender in Leadership UK Index Fund, known as the 'GIRL Fund' for short, which aims to improve gender diversity standards across business by allocating a higher weighting in its fund to companies with more women on its board, its executive team, in its management and in its workforce There have for a number of years been venture capital firms looking to back female-led start-ups, such as Monarq, a New York-based incubator fund that also puts female entrepreneurs in touch with potential mentors. This, though, has been a niche area until now. The arrival of players like LGIM and Goldman Sachs, backing their ideas with serious sums of money, suggests backing women-led businesses is about to enter the financial mainstream."
2018-06-23,Ex-serviceman Stanley Carby was 65 years old when he died at Gosport War Memorial Hospital under the care of Dr Jane Barton.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180623112057/https://news.sky.com/story/i-want-justice-over-my-fathers-death-at-gosport-hospital-11410165,"A long-awaited inquiry into deaths at the Hampshire hospital found 456 patients died through opioids prescribed ""without medical justification"". Among its findings, the inquiry concluded Mr Carby had been given the powerful drugs ""without appropriate clinical indication"". Here, Mr Carby's daughter Cindy Grant explains why she is hoping a police investigation will be launched to bring ""justice"" over her father's 1999 death. My dad was a jolly, happy, loving man. He was always up for a laugh, singing to his grand-kids with a smile on his face. He was the life and soul of the party. Trying to get justice for him over so many years has been a rollercoaster of emotions. It's heartbreaking. The day before he died, he was sat up in bed and seemed in good spirits, asking my aunt and uncle to place a bet on the horses for him. The next morning, we had a phone call saying he had taken a turn overnight. When my sister and I arrived at the hospital, he had been moved to a private room. He was unconscious. Dr Barton told us she suspected he had suffered another stroke and that we should ""let nature take its course"". She said she would make him comfortable with a syringe driver of morphine and midazolam, a powerful sedative. We didn't ask any questions. She was the medical professional so we accepted what she said. My family were distraught. We were in shock seeing my father like that. The hospital staff wanted to give me an injection to calm me down but I refused. We asked why we weren't contacted in the night. Why hadn't he been transferred to another hospital? After my father passed away, Dr Barton signed the cause of death as a cerebrovascular accident - a stroke. But other doctors, nurses and pharmacists have told us the last thing you give to a stroke patient is morphine with midazolam. We know what Jane Barton did was wrong. She was very abrupt, cold and uncaring. There was no emotion on her face whatsoever. It is a farce that she was never struck off and I'm hoping the outcome of the report leads to her prosecution. My mum was very poorly before she passed away in 2007 and my sister promised her we would keep fighting. After the pain and anguish that we, and other families, have been through, we are going to get justice. :: Hampshire Police concluded in 2006 that no-one would face prosecution over the deaths of patients at the hospital after a four-year inquiry. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said at the time that negligence could not be proven to a criminal standard and that there was no realistic prospect of conviction of healthcare staff. :: In 2010, the CPS announced that no criminal charges were to be brought against Dr Barton after finding there was insufficient evidence to mount a prosecution for gross negligence manslaughter in 10 key cases."

The shops earmarked for closure, including its flagship Oxford Street store in London, will remain open until early 2019. House of Fraser secured the backing of more than 75% of creditors, including landlords. It was approved despite anger among landlords, who have complained that they are being forced to take a financial hit while House of Fraser enjoys new investment. Alongside the CVA, Hamleys owner C.banner is being lined up to buy a 51% stake and invest £70m into the remainder of the business. Landlords berated the chain's management and their advisers at KPMG over how the CVA was conducted, complaining that their share of the vote had been structured unfairly in an attempt to push through the restructuring proposal. A representative for two of House of Fraser's landlords said there had been ""no give"" from the top team. The company's boss, Alex Williamson, had warned that the move represented the ""last viable"" option to save the retailer, with the group at risk of collapse had the CVA been rejected. There are also plans to relocate its Baker Street head office and the Granite House office in Glasgow to help cut costs and secure its future. The closures can be attributed to rising costs and business rates, competition from online rivals and a slowdown in consumer spending."

The blaze ripped through the building from around 11.20pm last Friday, spreading to nearby properties, including the O2 ABC. Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken has asked people to stay away from the area, which remains sealed off. She said: ""Our building control officers are saying part of the building has moved quite significantly, about six inches. ""The elevation has shifted. There's a danger that part of the building may collapse. ""If that were to happen, it could happen with no warning. ""Therefore it's very, very important that no one enters the cordon - unless they are an accredited expert."" It comes as police revealed they had received a report of a break-in at the nearby Campus on Sauchiehall Street around 3.20am on Thursday. The bar is inside the cordon, which was put up to seal off the area after the fire at the Mackintosh Building, and police are investigating. A spokesman said: ""Inquiries are continuing following a break-in at premises on Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow at around 3.20am on Thursday June 21."" The council said there had been other reports of people breaching the cordon, raising safety concerns, and urged people to stay away. Glasgow City Council's head of building control Raymond Barlow said: ""I fully understand people's desire to get back into their property and if we could safely do anything to facilitate that then we would. ""However surveys in recent days have shown us that the West and East elevations remain of significant concern. ""This means that there is a risk that parts of the building might fall into Scott Street or Dalhousie Street. This could happen without warning."" More than 120 firefighters were involved in fighting the blaze. There were no reports of any casualties, although some properties were evacuated. The building, designed by artist and architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh and built between 1897 and 1909, was undergoing restoration after being damaged by a fire in May 2014. It was due to reopen in 2019."

2018-06-23,"A leading UK beauty pageant has vowed to keep its swimwear round, despite a US-equivalent deciding to scrap the event from its competition.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180623112057/https://news.sky.com/story/miss-great-britain-to-keep-swimsuit-category-11413905,"Earlier this month, the Miss America beauty pageant said contestants would no longer have to take part in a mandatory bikini round. The pageant's managers said the shift would put more emphasis on a contestant's talents and skills, rather than her looks. But the organisers of Miss Great Britain told Sky News that they had no plans to follow suit. ""We fully appreciate the potentially divisive nature of our decision but it is based on what our contestants want and have asked for,"" a spokesperson said. ""Many of those stated that the swimwear round made them feel most empowered and focused. ""The contestants choose their own swimwear and we make it clear that sarongs, kaftans and swimwear of any description is allowed and the ladies embrace this personal choice."" Model Poppy Haskell explains why she believes Miss America organisers are wrong to end the swimsuit segment of the contest. The 2017 #MeToo campaign against sexual harassment which started in Hollywood has led to a greater scrutiny of the objectification of women across the globe. Earlier this year, F1 racing decided it would no longer use promotion women, known as grid girls. Similarly, the British Professional Darts Corporation stopped using ""walk-on-girls"" as player escorts. But the decision by Miss Great Britain to keep its round has been welcomed by some in the pageant industry. Poppy Haskell is Miss Swimwear UK. She says winning the contest, which involved her wearing a bikini in front of judges, has kick-started her career in modelling and promotions work. ""Women know exactly what they are going into,"" Miss Haskell told Sky News. ""They are normally using pageants as a catalyst for a further end career goal. And I think taking that away is taking away their choice, which is a negative thing."" Images of bikini-clad women are difficult to avoid on TV or social media, especially during the summer. Body image expert Natashe Devon told Sky News that where it can become a problem if these image promote one body-type as the ideal. ""If you are bombarded by unrealistic imagery of people who look unattainable, then it's going start to negatively affect your self-esteem,"" Ms Devon said. ""But if your body diverges from what we consider to be beautiful, if for example we have scars, or blemishes or stretch marks, you are representing something that is a little bit different, then it's been shown to have a positive impact on how people feel about themselves."" That is what led one woman to create the a plus-size beauty pageant. Samantha Coote founded Miss British Beauty Curve, a pageant for women size 14 or over, after she felt unable to enter a traditional pageant because she was plus-size. Ms Coote says her contest does have a swimwear round, and for plus-size ladies it's liberating. ""It's a great round, it's fun!"" Ms Coote told Sky News. ""Society makes us feel so self-conscious as women about our bodies. ""And I think it should be celebrated, and why shouldn't we wear swimwear, whatever size we are?"""

But aerospace giant Airbus has joined the small number of firms warning about the state of negotiations. Here are some of the others... :: BMW The German car manufacturer weighed in last year, when its head of purchasing called Brexit a ""very uncomfortable scenario"". It was among a group of major European firms last month to warn that ""time is running out"" in negotiations. BMW, along with BP, Nestle and Vodafone, told Prime Minister Theresa May a trade deal with the EU must be ""frictionless as with a customs union"". :: Deutsche Bank Up to 4,000 workers could be moved from London to Frankfurt, a senior executive from Deutsche Bank warned last year. Its chief regulatory officer said ""we really need clarity"" and that staff had ""real questions"", such as: ""Where do I register my children for in the next two years at school?"" Another executive, the head of Deutsche's capital market division in Germany, later said they thought ""not thousands but rather hundreds"" would be relocated from Britain to Germany. :: Chubb US insurance giant Chubb announced it would relocate its European headquarters from London if the UK left the customs union. It has not directly criticised the government, but said it had been ""encouraged by the assistance and cooperation provided by the French government as we have considered our post-Brexit options"". :: Rolls-Royce The car manufacturer's chief executive called last year for ""as little change as possible"" as he warned against a ""hard"" Brexit. It came days after Chancellor Philip Hammond confirmed the UK would pull out of the single market and customs union. :: Nissan Japan's second-biggest carmaker may have expanded operations in Sunderland following secret assurances given by ministers, but it teamed up with Toyota and the Japanese ambassador to head to Downing Street for more talks in February. The diplomat warned afterwards that: ""If there is no profitability of continuing operations in the UK - not Japanese only - then no private company can continue operation. ""It is as simple as that. This is all high stakes that all of us, I think, need to keep in mind."""
2018-06-23,"It is a puzzle that has taken more than 100 years of research to solve and its source has kept thousands of people awake at night… what causes the ""plink plink plink"" noise of a dripping tap?",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180623112057/https://news.sky.com/story/scientists-discover-what-causes-the-plink-plink-plink-of-a-dripping-tap-11413756,"Now, curious scientists have identified what causes the noise and how to solve it. Using cutting-edge video and audio recording technology, the noisy offender was discovered to be an air bubble that forms and vibrates when the droplet hits the water. The latest hunt to find what was voted one of the twenty most annoying noises in Britain in 2016 began when Anurag Agarwal was being kept awake by the sound of a leak while staying at a friend's house. ""I was being kept awake by the sound of water falling in a bucket,"" the professor at the University of Cambridge recalled. ""The next day I discussed it with my friend and another visiting academic and we were all surprised that no one had actually answered the question of what causes the sound."" Using ultra-slow-motion video, a microphone and a hydrophone, the researchers were able to perceive details that had previously gone unnoticed. An image published in 1908 in Arthur Mason Worthington's ""A Study of Splashes"" captured for the first time the moment a drop punctures a body of water's surface. The image shows the formation of a cavity - like a thimble turned upside down - on the surface upon impact, followed by a column of water rising as the cavity recoils. Around 1920, a team of researchers in England decided that resonance inside this cavity was the cause of the sound. In 1955, another breakthrough was made. Scientists noticed the formation of a tiny bubble of air briefly trapped beneath the cavity as it took shape. They wondered if the sound was made when this bubble burst. Since then, dozens of published experiments with increasingly precise instruments backed up this idea. ""Until now, everyone thought these sound waves just passed through the water surface and that's how we heard the sound, much like if you hear someone speaking through a wall,"" said Samuel Phillips, an undergraduate student at the University of Cambridge and lead author of a study in Scientific Reports. What Mr Phillips and his team found, was that the trapped air bubble vibrates as the cavity deepens. ""Sound waves emitted by the vibrating air bubble don't simply pass through the water surface into the air, as previously thought,"" Mr Phillips explained. ""Rather, the oscillating bubble causes the water surface itself to vibrate at the bottom of the cavity, acting like a piston to drive sound waves into the air."" And how to combat the noise until the leak can be fixed? Add a little dish-soap, the scientists advise. ""It changes the surface tension of the water, and so prevents the bubble from being trapped under the water,"" Mr Phillips said. ""No bubble means no sound, hence no 'plink'!"""

Mr Johnson urged Mrs May to deliver a ""full British Brexit"", not something that was ""half-hearted"". Writing in The Sun, he said: ""Across the country I find people who - whatever they voted two years ago - just want us to get on and do it. ""They don't want a half-hearted Brexit. ""They don't want some sort of hopeless compromise, some perpetual pushme-pullyou arrangement in which we stay half-in and half-out in a political no man's land - with no more ministers round the table in Brussels and yet forced to obey EU laws. ""They don't want some bog roll Brexit, soft, yielding and seemingly infinitely long. ""They want this Government to fulfil the mandate of the people and deliver a full British Brexit."" Organisers of the People's Vote march expect thousands of anti-Brexit supporters to descend on Parliament Square later, where speakers will include Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, Tory former minister Anna Soubry, Labour's David Lammy and Green co-leader Caroline Lucas. Sir Vince is expected to say: ""Brexit is not a done deal. Brexit is not inevitable. Brexit can be stopped. ""Parliament is fiddling at the margins while the country slowly burns."" He will add: ""Theresa May admits there will be damage. Her policy is damage limitation. ""Better to stop the damage. To return the issue to the people, to vote on the deal (or no deal). ""With the option of staying in the EU and working to improve it rather than walk away."" Research by the Centre for European Reform has shown Brexit has already made the UK economy 2.1% weaker than it would have been if voters had decided to stay in the EU. Data from similar economies, including Canada, Japan, Hungary and the US was used to estimate how the UK would have performed. :: Firms that have issued warnings over Brexit CER deputy director John Springford said: ""Two years on from the referendum, we now know that the Brexit vote has seriously damaged the economy. ""And we know that the government's 'Brexit dividend' is a myth, the vote is costing the Treasury £440m a week, far more than the UK ever contributed to the EU budget."" Meanwhile, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said the UK was not ""bluffing"" about being prepared to walk away from talks with Brussels. He said the economic impact of a ""no deal"" Brexit on EU members would be ""severe""."

Chante Spencer said the group had been waiting 25 minutes for the bill and one woman - not a member of the sorority - had threatened to leave.

She said: ""Police were standing there to make sure everyone paid, which we felt was racial profiling."" @Starbucks The police were called because these men hadn’t ordered anything.

Delta Sigma Theta sorority is a group if ""college educated women committed to the constructive development of its members and to public service with a primary focus on the Black community"", according to its website. The restaurant has apologised to the group, which included a doctor, a judge, teachers and professionals, saying it ""fell short of delivering great service"". Rich Jeffers, senior director of communications at Darden which owns Bahama Breeze, said in a statement on Thursday that the manager is longer employed at the restaurant. He said: ""The manager involved no longer works for us because they mistreated a guest, which is inconsistent with our values.

The campaigner argues the ""denial of existence is the worst act of discrimination by the gendered majority against the non-gendered"". Elan-Cane believes the current passport forms are discriminatory, but a judge who heard arguments in the case in London in April dismissed the judicial review action today. During the April proceedings, Elan-Cane's lawyers challenged the lawfulness of the policy administered by Her Majesty's Passport Office, which is part of the Home Office, arguing that it breaches human rights laws. Mr Justice Jeremy Baker said although he was not at present satisfied that the current policy is unlawful, part of the reasoning for that decision was that a comprehensive review has not been completed. Elan-Cane's lawyer, Kate Gallafent, argued the policy breaches Article 8 - the right to respect for private life - and the right to not be discriminated against on the basis of gender or sex, under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). 'X' PASSPORTS JUDICIAL REVIEW: I'm extremely sorry to say that today's judgment ruled HM Government's refusal to issue 'X' PASSPORTS was not unlawful. The good news is that ECHR Article 8 was triggered and sets a new precedent. I will update LiveJournal later today. ""For the claimant, obtaining and using a passport currently involves making a false declaration as to the nature of the claimant's gender identity, which causes the claimant considerable distress,"" she said. ""The lack of a non-gender specific passport option impacts on the claimant's ability to obtain and use a passport on equal terms with persons who identify, and are identified, solely in terms of male or female."" She told the judge the impact of the passport office's refusal to provide for ""X"" passports ""affects not only non-gendered persons such as the claimant, but a broad section of the public"" - including intersex and transgendered people and other individuals with gender dysphoria. After the ruling, Elan-Cane tweeted: ""I'm extremely sorry to say that today's judgment ruled HM Government's refusal to issue 'X' PASSPORTS was not unlawful. ""The good news is that ECHR Article 8 was triggered and sets a new precedent."" James Eadie QC, on behalf of the government, argued that if the policy constituted an interference with Article 8 it was justified by the need to maintain an administratively coherent system for the recognition of gender, to maintain security and to combat identity theft and fraud, and to ensure security at national borders."

Police said that local authorities, police and rescue workers were working with divers to look for 12 boys aged 11 to 15, as well as their 25-year-old coach. They are believed to have entered the Tham Luang Nang Non cave in Chiang Rai province late on Saturday afternoon. The group became trapped when a heavy rainstorm flooded a stream at the cave's entrance. Police chief Komsan Saardluan said parts of the cave, which is an estimated to be four to five miles long, get flooded to a height of up to 5m (16.5ft) during the rainy season, which runs from June to October. Thai television showed footage of bikes and backpacks left at the cave entrance. ThaiPBS television reported that the team members came from various schools in the province and are thought to have been practising before going to the park where the cave is located. The search began at about midnight on Saturday after police received a report of a missing child from a mother. She said her son had not returned from football practice that evening, ThaiPBS reported. It said that the mother last spoke to her son when he told her in the afternoon that he was with the group visiting a cave."

They include proposals to reduce ""pester power"" by stopping supermarkets from displaying unhealthy foods at checkouts, aisle ends and store entrances, as well as stopping products high in fat, sugar and salt from being included in buy-one-get-one-free deals. An end to sales of energy drinks to children, calorie labelling on menus in restaurants, cafes and takeaways, and the introduction of a 9pm watershed for advertising unhealthy products and similar measures online will also be put to consultation. Sainsbury's and the British Retail Consortium were among those who criticised the 2016 policy launch for not being tough enough, along with the Kings Fund health think-tank which described it at the time as ""unbearably weak"". The government is not admitting its previous policy, which promised a re-appraisal in 2020, was a failure and has instead re-cast it as ""a first chapter"", describing the new policy as a ""second wave"". The policy is part of a new effort by the government to engage voters on issues that deeply affect their lives. Ewan McDonald-Russell of the British Retail Consortium told Sky News that businesses accept the need for the government to take firmer action. ""If it brings forward measures and it has clear evidence, we're going to engage constructively, with the caveat that it has to apply to all retailers, to the whole food and drink industry."""
2018-06-24,Prince William has arrived in the Middle East for his most diplomatically sensitive royal tour to date.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180624211856/https://news.sky.com/story/prince-william-on-diplomatically-sensitive-royal-tour-of-middle-east-11415490,"The Duke of Cambridge has flown to Amman in Jordan for the start of his five-day visit and was met by Crown Prince Al Hussein bin Abdullah II. They will visit Fablab in Amman, an initiative set up under the Crown Prince Foundation that gives young people the training and technology they need to pursue business projects. Prince William will also deliver a speech at a Queen's birthday party at the British ambassador's residence. On Monday he will visit the Roman archaeological site at Jerash, and he will also meet Syrian refugees who have been helped by a charity supported by UNICEF. His time in Jordan is likely to be the least sensitive part of what will be a challenging week for William as he moves on to Israel and the occupied Palestinian Territories. It will be the first official visit to those areas by a member of the British Royal Family, and follows recent violent clashes between Israelis and Palestinians around the Gaza Strip. Talking about the aspirations for the trip, the duke's communications secretary acknowledged the ""complex challenges"" in the region. The aide added ""the non-political nature of His Royal Highness's role - in common with all royal visits overseas - allows the spotlight to be brought to bear on the people of the region: their cultures, their young people, their aspirations, and their experiences"". The prince will meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Reuven Rivlin, as well as Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Asked why the government has requested that he make this visit at this specific moment, the Foreign Office told Sky News that it was something that had been discussed for a number of years and that the leaders who will be meeting the prince understand his role is not political. Britain continues to support the international consensus for a two-state solution to end the Israeli Palestinian conflict. Violence broke out in May after America moved its embassy to Jerusalem, despite the ongoing dispute over the city. The UK has confirmed it has no plans to move its embassy. Tom Tugendhat, head of the foreign affairs select committee, told Sky News that ""having the Duke of Cambridge going around there isn't about reasserting a position or claiming a place"". ""It's about remembering who we are, it's about remembering that we have links around the world and that the prince is almost uniquely positioned to have a much softer engagement around the world and bring people together."" The visit will have been carefully choreographed to allow the prince to spend equal time with both Israelis and Palestinians, but it won't stop every part of his five-day trip from being heavily scrutinised."
2018-06-24,England are through to the knockout stage of the World Cup after a record-breaking result against Panama.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180624211856/https://news.sky.com/story/england-beat-panama-6-1-team-through-to-knockout-stage-of-world-cup-11415405,"The team won 6-1 - with the most goals they have ever scored in a World Cup finals match. Two penalties and a deflection from Harry Kane, two headers from John Stones and a stunning strike from Jesse Lingard left Panama in tatters. The hat-trick from the captain made him the first England player to score five goals in the group stage. Kane told the BBC afterwards: ""Fantastic. So proud of the boys. We are doing something tough but we've been working on our set pieces. It's just fantastic."" About the crowd, he said: ""It's been brilliant. It's what the World Cup is about - everyone coming together."" Asked if fan should believe England can go on and win the tournament, he said: ""We are not getting too far ahead of ourselves. I've said before you have to believe."" He later Instagrammed: ""Professional. Clinical. Bring on Belgium and the knockout rounds!"" John Stones added: ""To get through this time round, it's a special moment. We want to do the country proud, We will see how far we can go.""  UNRULY X JLINGZ A post shared by  Raheem Sterling x 😇 (@sterling7) on Jun 24, 2018 at 7:55am PDT Raheem Sterling said afterwards on Instagram: ""What a team performance, let's continue to build on this #ComeOn."" England got off to a swift start after shaky first five minutes when Stones came from the back of the box to head in from a set piece that saw aggressive behaviour from Panama's players. The second came from a penalty after Lingard was brought down by Panamanian Fidel Escobar. Lingard stole his own piece of the glory when he went through defenders on the edge of the box to drive a strike into the top right corner. Another penalty came after the referee lost patience with Panama's shoving during an England corner, with Kane slamming in his shot in exactly the same place as the first spot kick. With the mostly Russian crowd still reeling from the goalfest, England won another free-kick and put together an elaborate set piece which ended with Stones putting in his second after a first header from Raheem Sterling was blocked. Eighteen minutes into the second half, just as it looked like Panama were beginning to bring things under control, Ruben Loftus-Cheek shot hit the heel of the captain to give him the first hat trick in a World Cup finals by an England player since Gary Lineker in Mexico 1986 against Poland. Panama got a consolation goal when Felipe Baloy met a free-kick with a strike to beat England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford. The margin of victory means England are currently level with Belgium on goal difference as they go into their last group stage match on Thursday. The result means that England join Belgium, Russia, Uruguay, France, Croatia and Mexico in the last 16. The size of Panama's defeat has left some hopeful that it could mean England could go on to win the tournament for the first time since 1966, with others remaining cautious. Liam Gallagher said on Twitter: ""It's coming home."" Comedian Jack Whitehall tweeted: ""Reminder: Hope comes with very dangerous side effects. #ENG #KeepCalm"" The game was marred by poor on-pitch behaviour by Panama who currently hold the record for the number of bookings in Russia 2018."

2018-06-24,"A lot has been said and written during the last decade about how the macho, testosterone-charged working environment in the City and on Wall Street contributed to the financial crisis by encouraging reckless risk-taking.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180624211856/https://news.sky.com/story/goldman-sachs-to-invest-500m-in-firms-owned-by-women-11410985,"Undoubtedly there is an element of truth to that, while the recent revelations in the Financial Times about the President's Club dinner also led to many 'Sexism in the City' headlines, even if the event was attended largely by people working in the commercial property sector rather than in financial services. Scratch beneath the surface, though, and there is growing evidence that leading financial institutions are trying hard to address issues such as the gender pay gap and to push for gender equality in the workplace. Yet not only is there a gender pay gap, there is also a gender investing gap, which some leading institutions are now seeking to tackle. The latest example is Goldman Sachs, which has just set aside $500m that it intends to invest in companies that are led, founded or owned by women. The initiative, called Launch With GS, will also provide seed capital for female investment managers who are setting up their own funds. Stephanie Cohen, chief strategy officer at Goldman, said women-led businesses did not seem to be getting the investment they deserved. She said only 2% of US venture capital in 2017 went to companies with all-women founding teams and just 12% to teams with at least one woman, while fewer than 2% of US private equity firms were female-owned. She added: ""Whether these dismal numbers are due to poor sourcing, lack of supply or outright bias, or some combination thereof, the end result is clear: picture a founder or CEO in your mind, and it's probably a man. ""Investing in women entrepreneurs with great ideas will help, but it's going to take a lot more than just smartly directed dollars."" Launch With GS is the second initiative Goldman has carried out in this field but the previous one, 10,000 Women - which provided capital and business education to female entrepreneurs in emerging markets - was a philanthropic venture, while this time the bank hopes to make money from its investment. Ms Cohen added: ""Our goal with Launch With GS is to generate strong investment returns. The bottom line is this makes sense for our business - because investing and helping companies grow is our business. ""We also hope it makes a difference for women who have big ideas but find themselves cut out of the funding ecosystem."" Goldman Sachs is not the only organisation trying to cut the gender investment gap. The fund manager Legal & General Investment Management recently launched the L&G Future World Gender in Leadership UK Index Fund, known as the 'GIRL Fund' for short, which aims to improve gender diversity standards across business by allocating a higher weighting in its fund to companies with more women on its board, its executive team, in its management and in its workforce There have for a number of years been venture capital firms looking to back female-led start-ups, such as Monarq, a New York-based incubator fund that also puts female entrepreneurs in touch with potential mentors. This, though, has been a niche area until now. The arrival of players like LGIM and Goldman Sachs, backing their ideas with serious sums of money, suggests backing women-led businesses is about to enter the financial mainstream."

She wore a full-length white wedding dress and he was dressed in a traditional morning suit. The actors met in 2012 while filming the long-running saga in Iceland, where they were playing Jon Snow and Ygritte. Their engagement was announced in The Times last year, and a wedding date of 23 June was posted at the Huntly registration office in Scotland. The actress - whose full name is Rose Eleanor Arbuthnot-Leslie - is a descendant of Charles II and her family owns the 12th-century Wardhill Castle in Aberdeenshire, where the ceremony took place. Her father said he was ""thrilled"" for his daughter as she prepared to marry her former co-star. Guests lined the path as the couple left the church after the ceremony and showered them with flower petal confetti. They got into an old land Rover Destroyer decorated with ""Just Married"" paper hearts and tin cans tied to the back. Speaking outside the castle before the ceremony, Sebastian Leslie said: ""We are absolutely thrilled for Kit and Rose to be marrying today."" Co-stars Emilia Clarke, who played Daenerys Targaryen, and Peter Dinklage, who played Tyrion Lannister, were seen arriving in nearby Aberdeen on Friday. Fans of the Sky Atlantic series had been gathering outside the castle hoping to catch a glimpse of the stars. Two Chinese students, who are currently studying in Glasgow, brought flowers. Yunyao Li, 23, and Qiong dan Xu, 23, said they were fans of Jon Snow. ""We would like to see him if possible,"" one said. The impressive castle where the wedding was held, complete with turrets and surrounded by countryside and woodland, can sleep 16 people in the main house but there are more properties in the grounds. The castle's website says: ""This venue is ideal for those wanting to plan their own day without having to use a set format."" And it adds: ""The castle offers a superb backdrop for a marquee wedding on the lawn for your big day complete with floodlights to illuminate the castle whilst watching fireworks from the terrace!"" In an interview with Italian Men's Vogue, Harington, who was born in west London to a playwright and a baronet, said it was easy to fall in love with Leslie. Speaking of their time together on the show, he said: ""If you're already attracted to someone, and then they play your love interest in the show, it becomes very easy to fall in love."" Harington's ancestors are said to include James I and Gunpowder Plot leader Robert Catesby. Describing his time in Iceland, he told Vogue: ""The country is beautiful... the Northern Lights are magical... it was there that I fell in love."""
2018-06-24,An MP suspended by Labour over a sexual harassment allegation has said he will no longer cooperate with an internal investigation into his behaviour because he believes it is politically motivated.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180624211856/https://news.sky.com/story/labour-mp-john-woodcock-slams-tainted-sexual-harassment-investigation-11415664,"John Woodcock accused the party of ""allowing its disciplinary process to be tainted and open to charges of rigging"". He strongly denies the accusation of sexual harassment but says he understands the probe has to be ""thorough and fair"". In a letter to Jennie Formby, Labour's general secretary, Mr Woodcock accused her of having a ""disregard for the law"" by not providing an update on the investigation's progress. He said he had been forced to take her to court to ""comply with the basic legal responsibility"". Mr Woodcock has demanded that an independent official be appointed to lead the inquiry instead. Ending his letter, the Barrow and Furness MP said he was making the document public as a ""pre-emptive step"" given the ""recent experience of Labour officials leaking private information to damage me"". Mr Woodcock, who is an arch critic of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, was suspended by the party in May. The Sunday Mirror reported he was alleged to have sent inappropriate texts and emails to a former female staff member between 2014 and 2016. He was first elected to parliament in 2010 and was a shadow transport minister between 2010 and 2013. A Labour Party spokesperson said: ""The Labour Party takes all complaints of sexual harassment extremely seriously, which are fully investigated and any appropriate disciplinary action taken in line with party rules and procedures. The process is the same for everyone. ""We are determined to challenging and overturning sexual harassment and misogyny within politics and the corridors of power, and across society as a whole."""

A counter-protest was held in Westminster by hundreds of those in favour of leaving the European Union. Liberal Democrats leader Sir Vince Cable addressed those who attended the march, saying: ""My message today is a very simple one: keep fighting, keep hoping, we will win."" Businesswoman and campaigner Gina Miller also told people: ""Let us hear you shout for a people's vote."" Some attendees chanted ""where's Jeremy Corbyn?"" during the march. The Labour leader is opposed to another referendum on EU membership. Mr Corbyn was visiting a refugee camp in Jordan on Saturday. A Sky News journalist accompanying him on the trip asked him to comment on camera about the march, but he declined. The march's behind-the-scenes organisation involves some of the most senior figures in British politics, including Labour peer Peter Mandelson, Lib Dem Peer Paddy Ashdown and Tory grandee Ken Clarke. The People's Vote campaign says on its website it is ""run by Open Britain"". Open Britain is a limited company formerly known as the In Campaign, which was designated by the Electoral Commission as an official lead campaign group in the referendum along with Vote Leave. Lord Mandelson, Tony Blair's former director of communications, is listed a current director. The march saw politicians, citizens and campaigners from across the UK walk from Pall Mall to Parliament Square, calling on the government to listen to their voices and give them a say. Among those taking part were farmers, doctors, teachers, delivery drivers, students, fishermen and veterans from the Armed Forces - as well as former supporters of Brexit. One marcher told Sky News: ""It's two years on now. Things have changed. Europe has changed. We should have another say."" Another accused the government of being incompetent. They said: ""When the vote took place, we could not have anticipated how incompetent this government would be on negotiating. ""It's not good enough to say 'the people said this at one point'…"" Matthew Mann, originally from south Gloucestershire, who moved to the Netherlands in 2016 for work, said: ""I'm here to show what a European looks like. ""I'm married to a French wife, I have two children who are dual national, and we live in Holland and are caught up in this administrative mess. ""I have lived and worked across Europe, it's home."" There was a cross-party presence at the march, with members of the Conservatives, Labour, Greens and Lib Dems all calling on the government to allow a vote on the final deal that is reached with the EU. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson has urged the prime minister to deliver a ""full British Brexit"", with International Trade Secretary Liam Fox warning that the UK was not ""bluffing"" about being prepared to walk away from talks with Brussels. In an article for The Sun, the foreign secretary said voters would not tolerate a ""bog roll Brexit"" that was ""soft, yielding and seemingly infinitely long""."

In Ireland, hundreds of people flocked to the beach at Brittas Bay to cool down - some heading for a dip in the Irish Sea. On the south coast, Margate's beach was a popular spot, with people cooling off in the sea pools. High pressure has brought settled and clear weather, with temperatures reaching the mid 20s in the South on Saturday. The warm weather will continue over the weekend, though the Shetland Islands may get some rain on Sunday morning. By Wednesday, forecasters are predicting that temperatures could hit 30C (86F). The change in the position of the #jetstream will help to give summer a real boost across the UK over the next few days. Here are the details pic.twitter.com/BHTkn2LqAI Chief meteorologist Frank Saunders said: ""As warmer air from the continent moves towards the UK from Wednesday, temperatures will climb into the mid to high 20s quite widely, even in parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland. ""By this stage, some places in England and Wales will very likely top 30C - it's not unlikely somewhere could reach 32C (90F). ""With almost wall-to-wall sunshine we'll certainly be looking at conditions which many of us would call a heatwave."" The Met Office estimates the weather will last until the end of June and could even continue into the first few days of July. UV and pollen levels will also be very high. Owen Landeg, from Public Health England, said: ""For some people, such as older people, those with underlying health conditions and those with young children, the summer heat can bring real health risks. ""That's why we're urging everyone to keep an eye on those you know who may be at risk this summer. If you're able, ask if your friends, family or neighbours need any support. ""And if you're going outside for a prolonged period, remember UV is high at this time of year so think how the sun affects you and what you'd do to make sure you don't get burned."" Temperatures across the rest of Europe are also steadily increasing, with Barcelona enjoying 27C (81F), Rome 28C (82F) and Lisbon basking in 26C (79F). World Cup fans will be enjoying temperatures of 29C (84F) in Moscow today. The highest temperature on record in the UK this year is 29.1C, which was recorded in St James's Park on 19 April. The highest June temperature ever recorded in the UK is 35.6C (96F) at Camden Square on 29 June 1957 and Southampton on 28 June 1976. Heatwave alerts will be sent out by Public Health England once daytime temperatures reach 30C (86F) and nighttime temperatures reach 15C (59F). Part of the advice will be preventing children taking part in ""vigorous outdoor play"". PHE also recommends eating food with high water content, keeping hydrated, and staying out of the sun between 11am and 3pm. If hot temperatures continue for three days, London Underground stations will supply bottled water."
2018-06-24,The heart-breaking legal fight over the treatment of Charlie Gard brought global attention to mitochondrial disease.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180624211856/https://news.sky.com/story/ex-hollyoaks-star-colin-wells-finding-a-cure-for-my-children-is-a-matter-of-life-or-death-11413582,"Here, former Hollyoaks and Casualty actor Colin Wells tells Sky News why he is hopeful a cure will be found after his two children were diagnosed with a rare form of the condition. One of the reasons I left Hollyoaks was to be able to help care for my daughter Rachael and son Joseph, or Jo-Jo as we call him. It's extremely rare to have both children diagnosed with mitochondrial disease - the odds are astronomical. Rachael was fine until she was about seven years old when she went deaf in one ear and later lost hearing in both ears. But it was in her early teens that we noticed things about her that were slightly different. We could tell something was wrong because she became a bit clumsy and she'd started to lose weight. After a check-up we were sent to see a geneticist. Rachael was diagnosed with a form of mitochondrial depletion syndrome known as RRM2B. It was a huge shock for the family. We know a lot of doctors, some of whom are close friends, and none of them could explain what the condition was. So we did some research ourselves. My wife Joanna was in a terrible state about the diagnosis and rang a support group for advice but it turned out to be hugely unhelpful. The woman on the end of the phone said this was going to be the end of the story and we should start preparing for the funeral. I wish we had found The Lily Foundation then as they do amazing work fighting mitochondrial disease. The truth is that many people with the condition can improve their strength by looking after themselves. Rachael is 20 now and uses a wheelchair. She can walk a little and she's fed intravenously. She has a ventilator at night because she could stop breathing without it when she falls asleep. We have to help her get dressed and she's unable to work because the condition leaves her with no energy. But Rachael is always positive. She loves drama and reading and she's able to ride horses with support. Her brother Jo-Jo, who is 15, was diagnosed the same condition two years ago. He was seen by a doctor who came round to the house, closed the kitchen door and broke the news to us. I just didn't want it to be true. In some ways it's worse for Jo-Jo because he looks at his sister and can see what is coming. Jo-Jo has a great sense of humour but he's scared of what is going to happen. He has a few good friends but withdraws himself at school. Very often he can't finish the day because he's tired and upset and texts me so I can pick him up. We're hoping that in a couple of years there is a cure, or at least some form of treatment, to help our children improve their quality of life. There have been massive improvements in some children around the world with TK2-related mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome so there is reason to be hopeful. More people seem to be aware of mitochondrial disease after the tragic case of Charlie Gard. I've met Charlie's mum Connie and she firmly believes it can be treated. Without an improvement in treatment for my children's condition, life expectancy is usually mid-20s to early 30s because it attacks the major organs in the body. Finding a cure really is a matter of life or death."

The 15-year-old was found with knife wounds and died at the scene. His family has been told but his identity has not been released. Police were called just after 9pm after reports of fighting and damage to the community centre in Clockhouse Lane. Three teenage boys have been arrested on suspicion of murder and are being questioned at separate police stations in east London. A bus driver in his 50s was treated at the scene for a head injury but there were no other injuries reported. A witness said friends screamed ""he's dead"" and ""they've killed my best friend"" as groups of teenagers ""scattered"" following the attack. The witness, who would only give her name as Carol, described hearing friends of the victim screaming and sobbing - adding: ""It was chaos out here last night. About 9.20pm I heard a lot of noise going on. For some reason it didn't sound right. It was mostly black boys out there. ""Then I heard a lad crying down the phone 'he's dead, he's dead'. ""He was lying down in the road, there was a lot of blood. The police were working on him, they tried their absolute damnedest with that boy last night."" All of the people who are known to have died so far in 2018. Detective Sergeant Gurj Singh said: ""I would like to directly appeal to those present to contact police about what they saw and heard to help my team build a clearer picture of what took place. ""Equally, if you have video footage or images of the violent aftermath to the party, we need to hear from you. ""Response officers who attended initial calls were confronted with up to 100 youths leaving a birthday party gathering at a community centre. ""There appeared to be fighting and tragically a teenager has been found with fatal injuries."" Witness Ellie Richardson told Sky News she ""was in the garden and we heard shouting from boys. I looked over the fence and there were kids screaming and crying, saying 'he's dead'. ""We saw a big crowd around the corner and there were kids trying to see if he was alive and turning him over. Police and ambulance came, it was all locked off."" Response Team Inspector Michael O'Donoghue, from the Met's East Area, added: ""We will continue to provide a high-visibility presence and officers will be on hand to hear from those from the local community."" He said officers had been out in force on Sunday evening providing reassurance. After visiting the area, local MP Andrew Rosindell said news of the boy's death was ""devastating"" for residents. He added: ""We must now wait for all the facts about this incident to be released. ""Until then, our condolences must go to the family of the young boy whose life has so tragically been cut short on our streets.""

2018-06-24,Ex-serviceman Stanley Carby was 65 years old when he died at Gosport War Memorial Hospital under the care of Dr Jane Barton.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180624211856/https://news.sky.com/story/i-want-justice-over-my-fathers-death-at-gosport-hospital-11410165,"A long-awaited inquiry into deaths at the Hampshire hospital found 456 patients died through opioids prescribed ""without medical justification"". Among its findings, the inquiry concluded Mr Carby had been given the powerful drugs ""without appropriate clinical indication"". Here, Mr Carby's daughter Cindy Grant explains why she is hoping a police investigation will be launched to bring ""justice"" over her father's 1999 death. My dad was a jolly, happy, loving man. He was always up for a laugh, singing to his grand-kids with a smile on his face. He was the life and soul of the party. Trying to get justice for him over so many years has been a rollercoaster of emotions. It's heartbreaking. The day before he died, he was sat up in bed and seemed in good spirits, asking my aunt and uncle to place a bet on the horses for him. The next morning, we had a phone call saying he had taken a turn overnight. When my sister and I arrived at the hospital, he had been moved to a private room. He was unconscious. Dr Barton told us she suspected he had suffered another stroke and that we should ""let nature take its course"". She said she would make him comfortable with a syringe driver of morphine and midazolam, a powerful sedative. We didn't ask any questions. She was the medical professional so we accepted what she said. My family were distraught. We were in shock seeing my father like that. The hospital staff wanted to give me an injection to calm me down but I refused. We asked why we weren't contacted in the night. Why hadn't he been transferred to another hospital? After my father passed away, Dr Barton signed the cause of death as a cerebrovascular accident - a stroke. But other doctors, nurses and pharmacists have told us the last thing you give to a stroke patient is morphine with midazolam. We know what Jane Barton did was wrong. She was very abrupt, cold and uncaring. There was no emotion on her face whatsoever. It is a farce that she was never struck off and I'm hoping the outcome of the report leads to her prosecution. My mum was very poorly before she passed away in 2007 and my sister promised her we would keep fighting. After the pain and anguish that we, and other families, have been through, we are going to get justice. :: Hampshire Police concluded in 2006 that no-one would face prosecution over the deaths of patients at the hospital after a four-year inquiry. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said at the time that negligence could not be proven to a criminal standard and that there was no realistic prospect of conviction of healthcare staff. :: In 2010, the CPS announced that no criminal charges were to be brought against Dr Barton after finding there was insufficient evidence to mount a prosecution for gross negligence manslaughter in 10 key cases."

This was a rout - England scoring with all the regularity of a pendulum in the first half. It was 5-0 at half time. All the boys needed to do then was sit back and relax, confident of a place in the knockout stages, though not before the last goal of a hat-trick from the golden-footed Harry Kane. :: England through to knockout stage of World Cup Panama scored once in the 78th minute - their first-ever World Cup goal - and they're partying like they've walked away with the trophy. ""How d'you like the way we're celebrating?"" I was asked by one fan waving a camera in my face. Terrific. This is carnival, a Panamian fiesta, the greatest show on earth. They're not going to let the matter of almost total annihilation on the pitch get to them. England fans are outnumbered by the Panamians but there are more here than there were in Volgograd. And what a game to watch - Gareth Southgate's young and approachable team now firmly anchored in the hearts of the nation. They looked in control, they looked like they were enjoying themselves, it looked like they had a plan. Long may it last. And, once again, almost in chorus, every fan will tell you what a warm, enthusiastic, astonishing welcome they've had from the Russians. ""We cannot thank the Russians enough,"" said Paul Conroy from Liverpool. ""Boris Johnson doesn't know what he's talking about."" In contrast to other nations here, England fans have tried for the main to keep a low profile. Lots say they now regret not bringing their families or encouraging more of their friends to travel. They say the government did little more than scaremonger ahead of the games. I ask Mr Conroy if he has a message for Russia's president, given his enthusiasm for the country's people. ""Politics is a different thing,"" he says. ""This is a festival of football, for ordinary people."" This World Cup is going terrifically well for England, for the Russian national team and therefore by default for the Russian president too. He knows how to throw a good party when he wants to. And this is one."
2018-06-24,The first service operated by the new state-run franchise that runs trains on the East Coast Main Line has arrived on time.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180624211856/https://news.sky.com/story/first-state-run-east-coast-line-train-arrives-on-time-11415231,"The 7.54 London North Eastern Railway (LNER) service from Newcastle to London Kings Cross arrived at 10.52 as expected. The government took back control of the East Coast rail franchise after its private operators Virgin Trains East Coast lost money. The joint venture between Stagecoach (90%) and Virgin (10%) won the eight-year franchise to run services in between London and Edinburgh in 2014, but in February, Stagecoach's chief executive estimated total losses at £260m. Transport secretary Chris Grayling told MPs the East Coast was ""not a failing railway"" but Stagecoach and Virgin Trains had ""got their bid wrong"". The creation of the London North Eastern Railway (LNER) resurrected the name of the firm which had operated the line and a number of others in the post-First World War period. It was absorbed into British Railways when the lines were nationalised after the Second World War. For the first day of operation, the trains were still sporting the livery of the franchise's predecessor Virgin Trains. But Sky News understands trains with the new livery are expected to start running in the next few days. Despite the first train arriving on time, the service did suffer some disruption with several trains cancelled and a few others delayed. A spokesman said LNER was pleased the first train had arrived at Kings Cross on time but said it was difficult to ensure there would be no disruption. He said: ""It's been important to make sure there is no difference for customers. ""As with any operating railway, we do occasionally suffer some disruption, but LNER performance is a priority."" The East Coast service is operated by the Department for Transport through a so-called ""operator of last resort"" arrangement, while a new public/private partnership is established. Mr Grayling told Sky News in May he would consider plans ""to enable employees to share directly in the success of LNER both as a pure train operator and subsequently as the new partnership"". The transport secretary said there would be no sanctions against Virgin or Stagecoach for their failures, though Labour and unions criticised the decision to end the £3.3bn contract - saying it amounted to a bailout for the franchise."

But the policy launch to stop youngsters putting on so much weight - the second in less than two years - is part of a new effort by the government to engage voters on domestic issues that deeply affect their lives. Last week it was NHS funding, this week it's family health; both are issues that most of us care about and which touch us on an emotional level. And if that sounds like something out of a textbook on connecting with voters, that's because it is: specifically 'The New Working Class: how to win hearts, minds and votes' by Claire Ainsley from progressive think-tank the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. Her book amplifies research by right-of-centre think-tank Policy Exchange which identifies family, fairness, hard work and decency as the four key themes that voters in marginal seats say best describe their own values. Ainsley extrapolates this to the majority of voters - the low and middle income voters she calls the new working class - and argues that pushing those four buttons on issues that people care about can create a new politics that will engage and motivate people to vote. If this all seems a bit esoteric, here are some word searches: ""fair/fairness/fairer"" appeared in Theresa May's speech launching her NHS funding pledge a week ago five times; ""family"" appears seven times in Jeremy Hunt's press release launching the (second) obesity policy, and there are 12 mentions of ""parent"". And who can say how many times they've heard the phrase ""hard working families""? Family, fairness, hard work and decency are the magic words that can trigger an emotional response and engage us to support a well-argued policy. You might not have heard it here first, but you can be sure you will hear those words again. And again."

People have been voting in both presidential and parliamentary elections. The ballots will transform the country from a parliamentary democracy into an executive presidency - something approved by a narrow majority in a referendum last year. Under the new system, the president will be able to form the government, appoint ministers, vice presidents and top bureaucrats, issue decrees, prepare the budget and impose states of emergency. Opposition politicians had vowed to return Turkey to parliamentary democracy with strong checks and balances. ""The nation has entrusted to me the responsibility of the presidency and the executive duty,"" 64-year-old Mr Erdogan said. ""I hope nobody will try to cast a shadow on the results and harm democracy in order to hide their own failure."" Mr Erdogan, who has been in power since 2003, also declared victory for the People's Alliance, which comprises his AK party and the smaller Nationalist Movement Party. He said the alliance had a ""parliamentary majority"" in a new 600-member assembly, containing 50 more members than before. Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek said the apparent victory ""sets the stage for speeding up reforms"". Earlier, Mr Erdogan's main rival for the presidency, 54-year-old former physics teacher Muharrem Ince, accused the country's state-run Anadolu news agency of ""manipulation"". After the agency said 85% of ballot boxes had been counted, Mr Ince claimed it was only 37%. Election observers and party members should not ""abandon the ballot boxes"", he said. But government spokesman Bekir Bozdag alleged Ince was ""threatening and targeting"" the agency. Mr Erdogan said there had been no serious voting violations. Mr Ince, backed by the centre-left Republican People's Party, drew huge numbers at rallies in Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir. Five candidates ran against Mr Erdogan in the presidential race."

""I always do my best to treat people, including those I disagree with, respectfully and will continue to do so."" Last night I was told by the owner of Red Hen in Lexington, VA to leave because I work for @POTUS and I politely left. Her actions say far more about her than about me. I always do my best to treat people, including those I disagree with, respectfully and will continue to do so Stephanie Wilkinson, co-owner of the 26-seat restaurant in rural Virginia, told The Washington Post that she had been at home when she was contacted by the chef who had recognised the diner and wanted to know what to do. The table of eight had been booked under Ms Sanders' husband's name and when Ms Wilkinson walked into the restaurant, she saw they had cheese boards in front of them, as the kitchen worked on their main courses. Ms Wilkinson told the newspaper: ""I'm not a huge fan of confrontation. ""I have a business, and I want the business to thrive. ""This feels like the moment in our democracy when people have to make uncomfortable actions and decisions to uphold their morals."" She said several of her staff are gay and had seen Ms Sanders defend Mr Trump's efforts to exclude transgender people from the military. More recently, the staff had watched the press secretary defend Mr Trump's controversial immigration policy. Ms Wilkinson said she had consulted her employees and they had agreed that Ms Sanders should be asked to leave. She had then asked Ms Sanders to come away from the group so they could speak. ""I explained that the restaurant has certain standards that I feel it has to uphold, such as honesty, and compassion, and co-operation."" When Ms Wilkinson asked Ms Sanders to leave, the response had been: ""That's fine, I'll go"". ""They offered to pay,"" Ms Wilkinson said. ""I said, 'No. It's on the house'."" Earlier this week, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was at a Mexican restaurant in Washington DC when she was met by protesters yelling ""Shame! Shame!"". She later decided to leave. The protesters were responding to the Trump administration's ""zero tolerance"" immigration policy at the US-Mexico border."

The Ministry of Defence has declined to comment.

2018-06-24,A whistle-blower has claimed the Gosport inquiry ignored concerns that some syringes could be misused to administer dangerously high doses of medicine.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180624211856/https://news.sky.com/story/gosport-inquiry-ignored-evidence-about-dangerous-syringes-11415289,"The claims asserted that the concerns were ignored in order to avoid a national scandal and that the NHS was slow to take certain syringes out of use. The result may have been thousands more deaths. Explaining the issue, Dr Iain Lawrie, vice president of the Association for Palliative Medicine, told Sky News that some hospitals used two types of syringes in one unit - one to deliver drugs once an hour and the other to deliver drugs once every 24 hours. ""In trained hands, syringe drivers always have been safe, with good prescribing. But it's in untrained hands and people who have been prescribing doses that possibly they shouldn't... that's where the issues lie."" According to The Sunday Times, the whistle-blower was on the inquiry which concluded 456 people had their lives shortened after they were prescribed powerful opioids without medical justification. The panel was warned a national helpline would have to be set up, as well as a compensation fund, if the full scale of the scandal emerged. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has rejected the allegations - and insisted the independent inquiry ""would have said"" if there had been an issue. ""We have to respect the fact that this was an independent panel led by Bishop James Jones... this is someone who has spent his life taking on the British establishment,"" he said. However, Mr Hunt added the government would look into all the evidence relating to the use of the syringes, which were banned in countries such as New Zealand and Australia. He said: ""We need to look at all the evidence that we have... Urgent advice was sent as far back as 2010 and the information I have is that they were taken out of use in 2015... We will look at if that was as quick as it should have been."" The whistle-blower had told the newspaper: ""Anyone who has lost their granny over the past 30 years when opiates were administered by this equipment will be asking themselves, 'Is that what killed Granny?'"" The Graseby MS26 and Graseby MS16A syringe drivers were open to misuse, the claims say. About 40,000 of the devices - a quarter of the worldwide total - were in the UK, the majority in primary care. A 2008 paper by the NHS's now-defunct Purchasing and Supply Agency (PSA) said the devices were an ""essential component of palliative care"". The PSA said the devices, which appeared ""very similar aside from colour"", delivered drugs at different rates. ""Confusing MS16A (which delivers in mm per hour) with MS26 (which delivers in mm per 24 hours) can result in an infusion rate 24 times higher than required, and numerous adverse incidents of their type have been reported,"" the PSA said. It added there were safer alternatives. The Gosport report said: ""The panel has considered issues concerned with the particular syringe drivers, known by their trade name of Graseby, and is aware of the hazard notices which applied. ""The panel's analysis does not rest upon any issue relating to these notices."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""While there is a range of statutory requirements to monitor and improve safe management and use of controlled drugs, we would not hesitate to take further action to improve safety."" The panel said: ""These allegations are completely unfounded and without merit or support."""

The condition was brought into sharp focus by the case of Charlie Gard, who died a week before his first birthday as his parents fought to allow him to be treated in the US with a new form of treatment called nucleoside therapy. Liz Curtis, founder of the foundation named after the daughter she lost at just eight months, says the research could provide the help families like hers so desperately need. ""Currently there are no treatments, and there is no cure for mitochondrial disease,"" she said. ""So we need to keep looking to find something that will improve the quality of life for the families and the children who are suffering."" The research, jointly funded by the Australian Mitochondrial Disease Foundation, will be undertaken at the Wellcome Centre for Mitochondrial Research in Newcastle. Professor Robert McFarland from the centre hopes that it could expand the effectiveness of the therapy. He said: ""What's available at the moment is very limited for a very specific form of mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome. ""What we hope is the molecules that we are developing and testing in these cell will be much more effective at doing this job of repleting mitochondrial DNA and that we will be able to look at outcome measures in patients that will tell us if it's been effective."" Former Hollyoaks star Colin Wells and his actress wife Joanna have two children with the syndrome. Rachael and Jo-Jo weren't diagnosed until their teens, and said often the doctors they first visited were not aware of the condition. They have both provided tissue samples to help scientists find a way to make the treatments more readily accepted by the body. ""It's crucial research,"" says Rachael, now 20. ""And not only could it help people like me and my brother, it could mean advances in treatments for ageing, and even cancers."" Mum Joanna sums it up succinctly when she says the therapy could be ""the difference between life and death"". The Wells family, and dozens of others facing similar challenges, attended a weekend of seminars and workshops provided by The Lily Foundation at a Midlands hotel this weekend. For them, and thousands of others like them, the new research provides the potential hope of an effective treatment - or even a cure."

Football's world governing body has begun disciplinary proceedings against the players over their apparent Albanian nationalist gestures. It has also opened disciplinary proceedings against the Serbian Football Association for crowd disturbance and the display of political and offensive messages by Serbian fans. And it is reviewing statements that Serbia coach Mladen Krstajic made after the match. FIFA outlaws all political messages or symbols in stadiums and the two players could be banned for up to two games if they are found to have breached their rules. Many people in the former Serbian province of Kosovo, which has an ethnic Albanian majority, identify with the red and black flag. A Serbian crackdown on Kosovo Albanian rebels in 1998-1999 only ended when NATO intervened. Kosovo declared independence in 2008 but Serbia does not recognise the status, and relations between the two countries remain tense. The Serbian media called Shaqiri's goal gesture ""shameful provocation"". Shaqiri said his celebration in the Kaliningrad stadium was ""just emotion"" but added he was not allowed to talk about politics. The Serbian football association reportedly complained to FIFA before the game about the Kosovo flag on one of Shaqiri's boots. The Swiss flag is on his other shoe. ""We sought that he change the boots. It was a provocation, we were playing against Switzerland, not Kosovo,"" team official Jovan Surbatovic told Serbian state-run broadcaster RTS Shaqiri was born in Kosovo, while Xhaka's parents are originally from Kosovo. His brother plays for Albania's national team."
2018-06-24,Liam Fox has said he would be prepared to accept an extension to the Brexit transition period - putting him at odds with other Brexiteers.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180624211856/https://news.sky.com/story/liam-fox-prepared-to-accept-a-longer-brexit-transition-period-11414952,"The international trade secretary told Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday: ""Having waited 40-odd years to leave the European Union, a few extra months doesn't bother me if we're getting it right."" His fellow Brexit campaigner Boris Johnson has urged Theresa May to deliver ""full British Brexit"" and said the public want politicians to get on with the process. On Saturday - the second anniversary of the referendum to leave the EU - tens of thousands of people marched through central London to demand a vote on the final Brexit deal. Mrs May's former chief of staff is among those who have suggested the transition period after Brexit should be extended beyond 2020 in order to solve Cabinet indecision on customs arrangements. Nick Timothy urged Leave-supporting ministers to accept staying within EU frameworks for longer because arguments are continuing to rage about which of two customs options to choose. Government sources told The Times that Mrs May is set to ask the EU for another two years of transition - extending the period before full Brexit to seven years after the public voted for it. Mr Fox told Sky News: ""What I wanted was that we were outside of the single market and the customs union and outside the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. ""That's where I think we're going to end up. If we do it slightly more slowly in order to minimise any disruption that's fine by me."" He said an extension to the Article 50 period - which is set at two years by EU statute - would not be ""politically acceptable"" to him, but he refused to be drawn on whether he would resign if it did happen. But he said he would not have an issue with an extension to the transition period, which the government has said will end on 31 December, 2020, as there may be reasons why it is inevitable. Mr Fox added: ""To keep Britain in the European Union would not be politically acceptable. It would not be acceptable to me. ""If the transition period had to be extended for technical reasons... if, for example, one other country was unable to ratify the agreement or we didn't have technical means in place and we already had the withdrawal agreement and the future economic partnership already agreed, I wouldn't have a major problem with that, as long as it was very time limited and there was a unilateral mechanism for Britain to pull out of it if we thought that we were being kept in the European Union against our will."" Extending the transition period has the potential to reduce the possibility the UK would crash out of the EU without a deal - something some major companies have said would be unacceptable. Airbus, which employs 14,000 in the UK directly and is linked to 110,000 other jobs at suppliers, says a no-deal scenario would cause ""chaos at the borders"". The two customs arrangements the Cabinet are said to be arguing over - both of which may be unacceptable to the EU - are: a customs partnership with the EU, which would see the collection of Brussels-decided tariffs at the UK border; and a ""max fac"" (maximum facilitation) option, which relies on technology and a ""trusted trader"" plan to reduce post-Brexit customs checks."

He added that he had been inspired by fellow 1960s rockers The Rolling Stones, who continue to tour the globe. ""I've got all these songs that I wrote for the band when we, not broke up, parted company, and I think it's kind of an appropriate time to do it,"" he said. Peter Quaife, who was in the band's original line-up, died in 2010. The Kinks formed in Muswell Hill, north London, in 1964 and became an influential rock band in the 1960s.

2018-06-26,Ex-serviceman Stanley Carby was 65 years old when he died at Gosport War Memorial Hospital under the care of Dr Jane Barton.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180626220342/https://news.sky.com/story/i-want-justice-over-my-fathers-death-at-gosport-hospital-11410165,"A long-awaited inquiry into deaths at the Hampshire hospital found 456 patients died through opioids prescribed ""without medical justification"". Among its findings, the inquiry concluded Mr Carby had been given the powerful drugs ""without appropriate clinical indication"". Here, Mr Carby's daughter Cindy Grant explains why she is hoping a police investigation will be launched to bring ""justice"" over her father's 1999 death. My dad was a jolly, happy, loving man. He was always up for a laugh, singing to his grand-kids with a smile on his face. He was the life and soul of the party. Trying to get justice for him over so many years has been a rollercoaster of emotions. It's heartbreaking. The day before he died, he was sat up in bed and seemed in good spirits, asking my aunt and uncle to place a bet on the horses for him. The next morning, we had a phone call saying he had taken a turn overnight. When my sister and I arrived at the hospital, he had been moved to a private room. He was unconscious. Dr Barton told us she suspected he had suffered another stroke and that we should ""let nature take its course"". She said she would make him comfortable with a syringe driver of morphine and midazolam, a powerful sedative. We didn't ask any questions. She was the medical professional so we accepted what she said. My family were distraught. We were in shock seeing my father like that. The hospital staff wanted to give me an injection to calm me down but I refused. We asked why we weren't contacted in the night. Why hadn't he been transferred to another hospital? After my father passed away, Dr Barton signed the cause of death as a cerebrovascular accident - a stroke. But other doctors, nurses and pharmacists have told us the last thing you give to a stroke patient is morphine with midazolam. We know what Jane Barton did was wrong. She was very abrupt, cold and uncaring. There was no emotion on her face whatsoever. It is a farce that she was never struck off and I'm hoping the outcome of the report leads to her prosecution. My mum was very poorly before she passed away in 2007 and my sister promised her we would keep fighting. After the pain and anguish that we, and other families, have been through, we are going to get justice. :: Hampshire Police concluded in 2006 that no-one would face prosecution over the deaths of patients at the hospital after a four-year inquiry. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said at the time that negligence could not be proven to a criminal standard and that there was no realistic prospect of conviction of healthcare staff. :: In 2010, the CPS announced that no criminal charges were to be brought against Dr Barton after finding there was insufficient evidence to mount a prosecution for gross negligence manslaughter in 10 key cases."

""When you talk about an expected bill of £14bn sterling, it's a perverse amount of money. It's ridiculous. It's outrageous."" ""It's always been incentivised to spend money. The airport has a bizarre, perverse incentive to spend more money than it needs to because it gets remunerated based on the money they spend,"" Mr Walsh said, referring to the formula set by the Civil Aviation Authority. :: MPs back third runway at Heathrow The airport can expect to recoup about £20 from the ticket price when passengers arrive and depart the airport. Mr Walsh, whose company holds the most coveted landing slots at the west London hub airport, said: ""We do support the expansion of Heathrow but it has to be at the right price and it cannot be the consumers using Heathrow that are expected to pick up the bill because of inefficiency of the airport."" The airport hopes to deliver the third runway and expanded airport by 2026. However, Mr Walsh believes there is ""zero"" probability of that but there is a 60% chance of delivery by 2028-2030.

Rose is in the England squad for the World Cup in Russia and came off the bench during the 6-1 win over Panama on Sunday, as Gareth Southgate's team secured a place in the last 16. But speaking ahead of England's final group game against Belgium on Thursday, Rose revealed there are some aspects of a footballer's lifestyle which can be unappealing. ""It is the best job in the world, don't get me wrong,"" he told Sky Sports News. ""But people seem to think there are no other issues within football, you just get your money at the end of the month and play every weekend. ""There is so much more to football than what people may see on Saturday and I don't believe in hiding that from people. ""Even though I feel very privileged to play football, with the things I have experienced within the game, it is not something I would be shouting from the rooftops, to recommend to people's children to be footballers. ""Because there are a lot of things that happen on a day-to-day basis at club football that I wouldn't wish on anybody.""   Rose would not reveal the specifics but, when asked if he meant the pressure of being a footballer, the 27-year-old added: ""There's pressure, there's politics, there's loads of things. ""There's not just playing on a Saturday and you receiving your money at the end of the month. ""There's so, so much more to football than what people see. ""My agent told me when I was 15, 16, 'you can have all the ability in the world but if you're not mentally strong enough football will swallow you up'. ""For 10, 11 years, I didn't have a clue about what he was talking about. It wasn't until this past year where I've realised exactly what he's meant. ""He's 100% right with what he told me all those years ago."" Earlier this month, Rose was praised by Prince William for speaking about his mental health battles. During a visit to England's World Cup training camp, the Duke of Cambridge broke off while chatting to a group of players to address Rose directly. ""If you don't mind me mentioning I think it's really very good what you did,"" said the prince, who is president of the FA. ""Well done. You should be really pleased. Loads of support from me on that,"" he told Rose."
2018-06-26,A couple have been sentenced to life for killing their au pair in London over a bizarre obsession with an ex-Boyzone pop star.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180626220342/https://news.sky.com/story/couple-jailed-for-life-over-murder-of-french-nanny-sophie-lionnet-11417364,"Sabrina Kouider, 35, and Ouissem Medouni, 40, were convicted last month of murdering Sophie Lionnet after her burned remains were found in their garden. The pair appeared in the dock at the Old Bailey on Tuesday and were told they face a minimum term of 30 years in prison. The shy 21-year-old French nanny was starved and tortured by the couple in the weeks leading up to her death in September last year. She was beaten and tortured by her employers after being accused of being ""in league"" with Kouider's ex-partner Mark Walton, a founding member of the Irish boy band Boyzone. Fashion designer Kouider, who is currently undergoing psychiatric treatment, and former banker Medouni interrogated their nanny for hours to extract some sort of ""confession"" to confirm their ""perverted suspicions"", dunking her head in a bath. Within hours, she was dead. Her body was then thrown on a bonfire in the garden as the pair barbecued chicken at their home near Wimbledon in southwest London. Miss Lionnet suffered a fractured jawbone hours before her death and is also known to have suffered bruising and fractures to her sternum and ribs between 36 hours and three days before dying. Judge Nicholas Hilliard QC told the pair: ""It is plain from all the evidence that Sophie was a kind, gentle and good natured girl."" He said the allegations she was plotting with Mr Walton to abuse the family were a ""complete fiction"" and no reason for the ""horrible cruelty"" and ""humiliation"" the defendants exacted on Miss Lionnet during taped interrogations before her death. ""The suffering and the torture you put her through before her death was prolonged and without pity,"" he said. In a previous statement, Miss Lionnet's mother Catherine Devallonne branded the couple ""monsters"" and told them: ""No one, no god will ever forgive you both for what you have done to my daughter... You are equally as evil as one another."" The couple, who are both French nationals, later admitted disposing of Miss Lionnet's body but denied her murder, blaming each other for her death. In mitigation, Icah Peart QC said the fashion designer's delusional disorder coupled with an emotionally unstable personality disorder had caused her ""irrational and completely overwhelming fear"" that Miss Lionnet had been recruited by Mr Walton. He said her behaviour towards the victim was ""entirely driven by Ms Kouider's mental illness in her desperation to obtain evidence of Mr Walton's abuse"". Kouider reported her former partner Mr Walton to police more than 30 times and received a caution for calling him a paedophile on a fake Facebook profile. She also accused him of sexually abusing a cat, using black magic and hiring a helicopter to spy on her."

The conviction carries a five-year jail term. The 19-year-old woman was sentenced to death by hanging in May after she was found guilty of killing her husband Abudulrhmam Mohammed Hammad. She said she had acted in self-defence as he tried to rape her for the second time. Nahid Jabralla from the human rights group SEEMA Centre helped organise Ms Hussein's defence and she has called the appeal court verdict ""a step for justice in Sudan"". She told Sky News that prison chains have been removed from Noura's legs in the Dar al-Ta'bat Aka prison. Her lawyers expect to receive an official copy of the verdict on Wednesday and hope to visit her in prison. Ms Hussein's family will be required to pay 337,500 Sudanese pounds (£14,200) in compensation to the family of the deceased. Her father had arranged the marriage when she 15 - but she rejected the match and ran away. Under local customs, the groom's family were owed money. The teenager was lured back to the family home and compelled to wed several weeks later. Noura refused to consummate the relationship and five days after the wedding, her husband raped her while his uncles and cousins held her down. The next night, he tried to rape her again. She stabbed him to death. In her defence, she said she had taken the knife to bed and hid it under her pillow because she planned to kill herself."

The warning comes ahead of next month's NATO summit in Brussels where US President Donald Trump is expected to reiterate demands for European allies to take on a greater share of the burden of collective defence. The committee repeated its call for the government to raise defence spending from the NATO minimum of 2% of GDP to 3% - around £60bn a year - saying without additional funding the UK would be unable to maintain its military capacity and capability. ""Diminished capacity reduces the UK's usefulness to the US and our influence within NATO. The government must not allow this to happen,"" it said. It said that US Defence Secretary James Mattis had estimated that the UK benefited to the tune of £3bn peryear from its defence relationship with the US. ""This implies that both the UK armed forces and HM Treasury benefit from our close relationship with the US,"" it said. ""However, that will continue to be true only while the UK military retains both the capacity and capability to maintain interoperability with the US military and to relieve US burdens. ""For this to be the case the UK armed forces must be funded appropriately.""

2018-06-26,A Cheltenham Gold Cup-winning jockey is about to toast a payday from the sale of his chain of dental practices that will catapult him into the ranks of Britain's super-rich.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180626220342/https://news.sky.com/story/gold-cup-winner-waley-cohen-rides-to-300m-portman-dental-sale-11417811,"Sky News has learnt that Sam Waley-Cohen, the founder of Portman Dental, has struck a deal to sell a big stake in the company to Core Equity Holdings, a private equity firm. The deal, which is likely to be announced later this week, is expected to value Portman at more than £300m. It will involve Core Equity acquiring the stake in Portman that is owned by Livingbridge, another investment firm, as well as a chunk of Mr Waley-Cohen's shares. Sources said that the amateur jockey would remain closely involved with the business, both operationally and as a shareholder. The acquisition of a big stake in Portman will be Core Equity's first deal in the UK, with the firm having raised one of Europe's biggest debut private equity funds last year. Core Equity is understood to have seen off competition to buy Portman from rival bidders including Jacobs Holding, a Swiss family office which already owns Southern Dental, a group of NHS and private dental practices. Portman was set up in 2009 by Sam Waley-Cohen, the amateur jockey who stunned the horseracing world by winning the Cheltenham Gold Cup seven years ago. The company now trades from around 75 practices in the UK and is expected to use Core Equity's investment as a platform to accelerate its expansion. Portman is understood to have grown its profits substantially since its last accounts were filed at Companies House for the year to September 2016. Mr Waley-Cohen was due to ride Walk In The Mill in this year's Grand National but the horse was declared a non-runner after it was found to be lame. The proposed sale of Portman follows Bupa's takeover of the much-larger chain Oasis in an £835m deal in February last year. A string of takeovers led by private equity firms such as Nordic Capital in the European dental market have led to the creation of a cluster of large-scale operators in the sector. Another big player in the UK market is MyDentist, which is backed by the private equity group Carlyle and has about 450 practices. The price paid by Bupa for Oasis surprised analysts, who had pencilled in a much lower valuation for the business. Sources said that it had fuelled hopes at Portman that it could also attract a premium price in excess of £300m. The auction of Portman, which did not respond to requests for comment, is being run by Moelis, the investment bank. Livingbridge said in a statement issued when Sky News revealed plans for the sale process earlier this year: ""We do not comment on market rumour and speculation. ""Portman Dental Care is the fastest-growing privately led dental group in the UK and is well placed to build on the strong momentum it has generated in recent years."" ‎A spokesman for Core Equity declined to comment."

The ISC is a group of nine MPs and peers who scrutinise the work of Britain's security services. Mr Grieve was responding after a story in The Times said US officials were demanding changes into the report - due to be published on Thursday. The newspaper claimed it would call for ""sweeping changes"" to protocols governing how British spies operate in the field and increasing ministerial oversight over their activity. Mr Grieve said he was speaking out ""exceptionally"" to dispel fears of censorship and stop the claims ""distracting"" from his report's key messages. Only one word had been redacted from 300 pages ""to meet a US security concern"", the MP for Beaconsfield revealed. He said: ""On Thursday I will happily point you to where those asterisks are in the report and you can see for yourself that it is not a central issue, nor a controversial issue. ""The committee does not agree to redact material in its reports on grounds of embarrassment to anyone. ""So I can assure you that the US has not made wholesale redactions to the reports, as suggested."" Mr Grieve also attacked the government, accusing it of acting ""unacceptably"" by leaking the report to the media. ""It appears that that procedure has been abused in order to leak details of the reports, so as to draw the sting on Thursday,"" he said. The Cabinet Office declined to comment."

Following the second day of evidence at the inquiry, the London Fire Brigade has started a hashtag on Twitter to rally support for the watch manager. A tweet read: ""We salute our member Michael Dowden who was the first incident commander at Grenfell and was confronted by an unprecedented fire. He conducted himself with courage and professionalism in an impossible situation. We stand with him. Let's get this hashtag going. #IAmMichaelDowden"" Scores of people have used the hashtag to praise the firefighter's bravery both on the night and at the inquiry. Speaking on Tuesday at Holborn Bars, he said he arrived at the tower to find an ""orange glow"" coming from the window of Flat 16. Mr Dowden was asked to watch mobile phone footage from 1.19am, when he noticed the cladding was alight. With tears in his eyes, he asked for a 10-minute break, which was given to him by the chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick. Mr Dowden later said he had experienced ""sensory overload"" during the night and at the time he made his statement he believed the fire was still contained, though video footage shows embers coming out of the window. High-rise blocks are usually designed to contain fires in the flat of origin, known as compartmentation, allowing for a stay-put policy to be implemented. But the cladding outside Grenfell undermined this process. Mr Dowden told the inquiry he had no knowledge of the type of cladding used on the high-rise. He was asked if the fire spreading through the window might have been seen as a failure of compartmentation. He said: ""Not specifically, because, for me, the compartmentation is the internal part of the building. ""For me, as an incident commander on the outside, I wouldn't be too concerned if the fire breached the window because my assumption is we could tactically control that from the ground, particularly with a covering jet."" Mr Dowden said window breaches were not uncommon in high-rise fires. At about 1.16am, Mr Dowden became ""uncomfortable"" about the way the fire was burning, and said he couldn't understand why it wasn't being suppressed as a breathing apparatus team was inside. He told the inquiry: ""I had no previous knowledge on how that building was reacting, I had nothing to fall back on, no default in terms of my own previous knowledge about how that building was reacting at that moment in time. ""I did feel out of my comfort zone because I didn't have any previous experience to fall back on in terms of how that building was behaving and reacting."" He added: ""I didn't know at that point what I know now, in terms of flammable cladding, the ACM cladding. ""If we were aware of that risk and that hazard at that point as we are now as an organisation we would have put things in place, but I wasn't aware of this cladding material put on to the external envelope of the building."" Mr Dowden also said he didn't remember a colleague telling him to ""slow down"" because the fire was out. He admitted he felt as though they could contain the exterior fire spread, as it started to catch on the external facade. Mr Dowden was asked about the stay-put policy and explained he did not have the resources to evacuate the building. He said: ""It is important to clarify that around that sort of time [1.24am] I only had six fire appliances in attendance, most of them were consumed in terms of BA resources at the bridgehead. ""We're looking at 20 floors above the fire floor with just six fire engines in attendance, one central staircase."" Mr Dowden, who has been a firefighter for 14 years, will return for a third day of evidence on Wednesday."
2018-06-26,"Donald Trump's travel ban on mostly Muslim countries does not discriminate or exceed the president's authority, the US supreme court has ruled.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180626220342/https://news.sky.com/story/wow-court-victory-for-trump-over-travel-ban-11417715,"The country's highest court rejected a challenge which claimed the ban on travel from five mostly Muslim countries discriminates against Muslims. It ruled 5-4 that the most recent version of the ban, which the Trump administration claims is justified by national security concerns, was valid. Mr Trump reacted to his major victory by tweeting: ""SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS TRUMP TRAVEL BAN. Wow!"" He then called the ruling ""a tremendous victory for the American people and the constitution"". Explaining the reason for throwing out the challenge, chief justice John Roberts wrote that presidents have substantial power to regulate immigration. ""In short, the language... is clear, and the proclamation does not exceed any textual limit on the president's authority,"" he wrote. ""The government has set forth a sufficient national security justification to survive rational basis review."" However, he was careful not to endorse either Mr Trump's provocative statements about immigration in general, or Muslims in particular. ""We express no view on the soundness of the policy,"" he added. Justices Sonio Sotomayor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan were the four who did not reject the challenge. Justice Sotomayor said: ""History will not look kindly on the court's misguided decision today, nor should it."" She said based on evidence ""a reasonable observer would conclude that the proclamation was motivated by anti-Muslim animus"". And she said her colleagues who voted against the challenge were ""ignoring the facts, misconstruing our legal precedent and turning a blind eye to the pain and suffering the proclamation inflicts upon countless families and individuals, many of whom are United States citizens"". SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS TRUMP TRAVEL BAN. Wow! The decision was made following a court hearing in April and is the culmination of a battle that began just days after Mr Trump took office in January 2017. Travel bans came fully into force in December when supreme court justices overruled lower courts. Travellers from five countries with overwhelmingly Muslim populations - Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen - were banned from travelling to the US. Two non-Muslim countries are also affected, with North Korean travellers blocked and some Venezuelan government officials and their families. Chad, a Muslim majority country, was removed from the list in April after improving ""its identity-management and information sharing practices,"" Mr Trump said. His administration used the Chad decision to show the restrictions are only for national security reasons. However, the challengers argued the court could not ignore everything that has happened, starting with Mr Trump's campaign tweets to prevent any Muslims entering the US."

Grilled about his remarks in the House of Commons on Tuesday, Mr Johnson told MPs his comments referred to Mr Trump's ""willingness, in defiance of the experts, to reach out to the leadership of North Korea and attempt to do a deal"". When Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry challenged Mr Johnson to list three things about his ""new hero"" that he ""increasingly admires"", the foreign secretary again highlighted Mr Trump's efforts in trying to reach a denuclearisation agreement on the Korean peninsula. Mr Johnson also cited the US president's military response against the Syrian regime over a chemical weapons attack, as well as Mr Trump's demand for European countries to spend more on defence. On the latter point, the foreign secretary revealed the government ""shall certainly be assisting in that effort"" ahead of a NATO summit next month. Ms Thornberry declared the record of Mr Trump, who ""bans Muslims and supports Nazis"", should not be admired but ""abhorred"" as she suggested the US president should not ""have the honour"" of meeting the Queen on his visit to the UK next month. Mr Johnson replied: ""It is right that the UK should welcome to this country the head of state of our most important and most trusted ally."" Ms Thornberry also used the pair's exchanges at Foreign Office Questions to mock Mr Johnson's absence from the House of Commons on Monday night, when MPs voted to back expansion of Heathrow Airport. The foreign secretary skipped the parliamentary showdown with a trip to Afghanistan on Monday, allowing him to avoid having to resign from the government in order to vote against a third runway he previously vowed to lie down in front of bulldozers to block. Mr Johnson had earlier outlined how the ""exceptionally close"" friendship between the US and UK did not prevent ministers from speaking out against American policies. He suggested Theresa May's recent condemnation of the separation of undocumented children from their parents in US migrant detention facilities had prompted Mr Trump to backtrack. Mr Johnson told MPs: ""I think that when the prime minister spoke, she spoke indeed for me and for everyone else in this House and indeed for the nation. ""No sooner had she spoken… the president signed an executive order repealing the policy."" Among those MPs to speak against Mr Trump, the SNP's Peter Grant branded the US president a ""serial child abuser"", telling the House of Commons: ""Putting children into concentration camps is not acceptable. ""He has not yet taken them out of these camps, he's holding them hostage to force their parents to give up their claims to asylum."" Last week, Mrs May told the House of Commons that ""pictures of children being held in what appear to be cages are deeply disturbing"", adding: ""This is wrong; this is not something that we agree with."" Mr Trump has bowed to pressure and promised to ""keep families together"" who are detained on suspicion of crossing the US border illegally."

The 56-year-old is alleged to have first kicked one of the deputies, and then a paramedic who came to assess her condition. She was described as ""appearing to be extremely intoxicated"" by one of the first officers on the scene. Locklear was taken in shortly before midnight and booked on two counts of battery. She was released on Monday after posting a $20,000 (£15,000) bail, and is understood to have checked in to a treatment facility. This is the second time she has been arrested this year. In February she was charged with four counts of battery on an officer after police were called to her home because of a dispute with her boyfriend. Locklear pleaded not guilty in that case, which remains pending. One of the biggest TV stars of the 1980s and 1990s, Locklear became a household name after winning the role of Sammy Jo Carrington in ABC daytime soap Dynasty. In recent years, Locklear has struggled with substance abuse and in 2008, was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of prescription drugs. And in 2012, she and ex-fiance Jack Wagner appeared in court after a violent fight. While still working regularly, her last show - political drama Too Close To Home - was cancelled at the end of last year after failing to secure a third season. Previously married to Motley Crue drummer Tommy Lee, Locklear has a 21-year-old daughter, Ava, with second husband, Bon Jovi guitarist Richie Sambora."

The force posted images of officers breaking into a red car, partially covered by a blanket, and two dogs panting in apparent relief after being freed from the sweltering vehicle. #PC1810 and PCSO 3680 have just rescued two dogs from a vehicle where the owners had left them for over half an hour in a car in the blazing hot sun. The window was smashed and the owners will be prosecuted by @RSPCAYORK. There is no excuse for this, I am utterly appalled…1/2 pic.twitter.com/xUMWUbzBVK York City police said the window had been smashed and added that the owners of the car would be prosecuted by the RSPCA. ""There is no excuse for this, I am utterly appalled,"" they added. ""Officers were in that car for thirty seconds and were struggling to breathe so goodness knows what these poor animals were going through."" Here are some pointers on how to get a good night's sleep, stay cool and enjoy the heatwave. The dogs were transferred to the care of RSPCA York - which tweeted its thanks to the officers for ""acting quickly to release the poor dogs"". The two animals were pictured with vets enjoying a cool shower after their rescue, although one still looked dazed by the experience. Many Twitter users thanked the police for their work and the report of the incident was shared thousands of times. The RSPCA has issued numerous warnings about leaving dogs in hot vehicles in recent days. On Tuesday, its York and Harrogate branch tweeted an infographic detailing the signs of heatstroke and warning that an increase of 2C can cause serious problems for dogs. Glassy eyes, a fearful expression, panting and drooling can be tell-tale indicators of dogs suffering in the heat, and especially bad cases can result in seizures and collapse. Animal charities advise that anyone seeing a dog in distress in a vehicle should call the police."
2018-06-26,The country's largest wholesaler is rationing supplies of some beers and soft drinks as the shortage of carbon dioxide (CO2) gas starts to bite consumers.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180626220342/https://news.sky.com/story/co2-shortage-shuts-down-slaughter-at-major-abattoir-in-angus-11417363,"Booker - which was bought by Tesco earlier this year - said customers including pubs, restaurants and stores were already being given limited stocks. A spokesperson said: ""Due to the international shortage of CO2, we are experiencing some supply issues on soft drinks and beer. ""We are currently working hard with our suppliers to minimise the impact for our customers and to optimise availability with the stock that is available. ""Therefore, we cannot comment further at this stage."" It confirmed the rationing - which is not believed to be affecting Tesco - as a growing number of firms and sectors complain of disruption. Heineken and Coca-Cola Great Britain are among drinks companies hit - the latter temporarily pausing some production lines but insisting there has been no disruption to supply. Just hours before Booker's warning, the owner of a major pig processing plant raised fears for animal welfare and meat supplies. Quality Pork, a partnership between UK meat processor Tulip and the Scottish Pig Producers (SPP) co-operative, said it was to suspend output at its Brechin slaughterhouse in Angus - Scotland's largest - at 4pm on Tuesday. It blamed a lack of CO2 gas, used as part of the stunning process, for the decision to stop work. The problem has been largely caused by shutdowns for maintenance at plants which produce food grade CO2, which is also used for things such as carbonated drinks, beer-making and vacuum packing. The drinks industry has said that while it expects there to be plenty of beer, lager and cider to go around during the World Cup, there could be availability problems surrounding popular brands at a local level if the gas shortage lasts much longer. Quality Pork chief executive Andy McGowan said his company's gas supplier had been unable to guarantee delivery to the Brechin pig plant. He said: ""That's the frustrating thing - they're not telling us anything...the top priority is animal welfare - we will not have ourselves in a situation where the welfare is suffering."" The company, which can process more than 6,000 animals in a typical week, is making arrangements for other abattoirs to take some of its work though they too have been affected by the gas issue. British Meat Processors Association chief executive, Nick Allen, said: ""The frustration is the lack of information. ""We understand that several producers are reopening plants and restarting production, but getting information is very difficult, which makes it very difficult to plan. ""Things are getting pretty tight and this hot weather won't be helping. ""If things don't alter this week, we're going to see people having to make some serious decisions, mainly in the pig production area."" Chicken processors have also complained of dwindling supplies."
2018-06-26,Uber has been granted a 15-month licence to operate in London in a decision which reverses a block placed on its service last year.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180626220342/https://news.sky.com/story/uber-granted-15-month-london-operating-licence-by-court-11417511,"Transport for London (TfL) refused to give the Uber a five-year operating licence last September, blaming failings in its approach to reporting serious criminal offences and to background checks on drivers. But Westminster Magistrates' Court has now accepted the firm's assertions that its corporate culture had improved since its license was revoked. Uber told the court there had been a ""wholesale change"" and it had appointed three non-executive board members. Chief magistrate Emma Arbuthnot granted the reduced licence but criticised the firm for attempting to ""grow the business, come what may"". Ms Arbuthnot previously indicated the 18-month provisional licence Uber was requesting would be ""too long"" for her to grant. It comes just days after Uber's UK boss admitted the decision not to renew its London licence last year was correct. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said: ""After years of operating poorly in London, Uber has now accepted that TfL's action in refusing to renew their licence was totally justified. Today our stance has been vindicated by the court. ""Uber has been put on probation - their 15 month licence has a clear set of conditions that TfL will thoroughly monitor and enforce."" He added: ""No matter how powerful and how big you are, you must play by the rules."" The costs for the case - £425,000 - are to be paid by Uber. Tom Elvidge, general manager of Uber UK, said the firm will ""continue to work with TfL to address their concerns and earn their trust, while providing the best possible service for our customers."" A TfL spokesperson said: ""As a result of our action, Uber has made a number of commitments to reform, including implementing a new governance structure and changing how it deals with allegations of criminal activity. ""The short-term licence with conditions allows us to closely monitor Uber's adherence to the regulations and to swiftly take action if they fail to meet the required standards."" Uber has been able to operate normally in London during the appeal process, and the firm could theoretically turn to higher courts if it is not satisfied with the outcome of this week's hearing. The taxi app is available in more than 40 towns and cities across the UK and has around 50,000 drivers in Britain, with some 40,000 in London. The firm has also been stripped of its licences in Brighton and York, but has gained new licences in Sheffield, Cambridge, Nottingham and Leicester."
2018-06-26,There are two ways to look at the warning from the European Banking Authority that some financial institutions are unprepared for a hard Brexit and need to be.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180626220342/https://news.sky.com/story/european-banking-authoritys-brexit-warning-is-nothing-of-the-sort-11416615,"One is that this is a straightforward, common-sense piece of advice. The possibility of a hard Brexit is certainly increasing as the Irish border issue, in particular, looms ever larger as a stumbling block. Supporters will argue that the EBA, which seeks to promote financial stability across the EU, is merely pointing that out and reminding the sector that even a transition deal is by no means guaranteed. The other is that this is a cynical intervention calculated at undermining the City and Canary Wharf and at persuading banks and other financial services institutions to move more of their staff away from the UK to Paris, Frankfurt, Dublin and other locations. :: Banks not prepared for no-deal Brexit The EBA will say that, in reminding banks that they must have sufficient numbers of staff at their new operations to ensure continuity of operations after Britain leaves the EU in March next year, it is merely repeating the warnings of others. For instance, this warning comes just days after Joachim Wuermeling, a member of the board of the Bundesbank, Germany's influential central bank, urged German banks to better prepare for a hard Brexit. Yet the EBA's advice does rather read and feel like an effort to chivvy banks into moving more staff out of Britain and particularly because it contradicts what the Bank of England has been saying recently. The Bank, which was not commenting on the EBA statement on Monday, made clear at the end of March that ""it would be difficult"", ahead of Brexit, ""for all financial institutions to have completed all of the necessary steps required to mitigate the risks to the provision of financial services in the EU and the UK"". To that end Sam Woods, the Bank's deputy governor for prudential regulation and chief executive of the Bank's Prudential Regulation Authority, wrote to banks and other financial institutions, making this observation: ""The Government has committed to bring forward legislation, if necessary, to create a temporary permissions regime to allow relevant firms to continue their activities in the UK for a limited period after withdrawal. In the unlikely event that the Withdrawal Agreement is not ratified, this provides confidence that a back-stop will be available."" That was a pretty clear signal to the financial services sector that, while it was important for them to prepare for Brexit, they need not panic about the prospect of Britain leaving the EU without a transition deal. The EBA's statement on Monday looks like an attempt to undermine the Bank's previous advice and one has to wonder why. Perhaps it is because it is some City institutions increasingly suspect the EU's own financial regulators are stalling on negotiations. As Miles Celic, chief executive of The CityUK, the main industry body, said: ""Financial services firms in the UK have had contingency plans in place for months. ""Our industry has had a constructive, ongoing dialogue with regulators and government. We have worked together to minimise the risk of disruption to clients and the wider economy. ""The single most helpful thing European authorities can now do right now is to engage urgently and seriously with the issue of contract continuity. The lack of progress by EU regulators on this vital issue is the most pressing item on the agenda."" If this has not been a deliberate attempt by the EBA to undermine the City, it is perhaps just a remarkable coincidence that Monday also saw a separate warning from the European Central Bank to banks looking to set up hubs in the eurozone that, if they did not have their licence applications in by the end of the month, it could not guarantee they would have their authorisations in place by the time of Brexit. The other clue suggesting this to be an attempt by the EBA to weaken the UK's financial services sector is in this line on page seven: ""Financial institutions… should assess the extent to which their MREL-eligible liabilities are issued under UK law (for EU27 institutions) or under EU27 law (for UK institutions), having regard to the fact that such issuances may cease to be eligible for MREL following the UK's departure."" Strip away the acronyms and this is essentially a warning from the EBA that banks may need to set aside more capital to cover lending in the UK. The only way in which the EBA could have been less subtle would have been for its chairperson, Andrea Enria, to have marched through the City with one of those old placards that advertised 'Giant golf sale, 250 yards next right' but instead reading 'Move to Paris/Frankfurt - ask me how'."

His trial at the Old Bailey heard how Ali, also a qualified gas-fitter, had been under surveillance by MI5 after returning from Afghanistan in late 2016 He had spent more than five years helping construct hundreds of bombs for the Taliban. Following his return to the UK, an intelligence database cross matched his fingerprints with 42 separate prints found on dozens of improvised explosive device components. As police and the security services began preparing a criminal case against Ali, he was being monitored by authorities, when it became clear he was about to launch an attack Deputy assistant commissioner Dean Haydon, head of counter terror policing in the UK, said Ali was a ""highly dangerous individual"". ""We were trying to understand what he was up to here and trying to get the evidence from international partners we could use in court, when we became pretty convinced that he'd rearmed himself with knives,"" he said. His arrest in April last year came just a month after terrorist Khalid Masood killed pedestrians on Westminster bridge, before fatally stabbing PC Keith Palmer outside the Houses of Parliament. Prosecutors believe Ali had been planning to target police, members of the military, or parliamentarians around Westminster The night before the planned attack, Ali's mother had called the police to her home after she discovered a set of kitchen knives on his bedroom floor But Ali was not arrested and counter-terror officers were not informed about the incident at the time. Ali was asked to leave the house after his mother told officers she feared for her safety. The next morning, he bought a new set of knives in Ealing, west London, before heading towards the heart of the capital. Mr Haydon said: ""We were pretty convinced he was about to launch a deadly terrorist attack here in central London and so we intervened."" The jury was shown a video of Ali's arrest, captured on a bodycam carried by one of the armed officers. It showed armed police running up to the suspect at the junction of Parliament Square and Whitehall and pinning him to the ground. One of the officers said: ""You are under suspicion of being a terrorist,"" and then asked Ali, ""What's your first name? Ali would not answer, so the officer continued: ""Do you have anything on you that may hurt anyone? Ali replied: ""You'll find out."" As they searched him on the ground, they found a total of three knives. Two 3.5-inch-long knives were recovered from his jacket pockets. Police then pulled an eight-inch Sabatier chef's knife from the waistband of Ali's tracksuit bottoms. They also found a bundle of cash in another pocket. He claimed later that he was carrying the knives for his own protection and that he simply wanted to deliver a message to leading politicians. In a police interview he said the message was not for them but for ""those who are running the country, that's why I was in the Westminster area"", adding it was ""for the leaders, those who are the decision-makers"". The message, he claimed was ""the same, it always will be, leave their lands, leave the Muslims to do whatever they are doing"". The court heard how Ali had joined a convoy delivering aid to Gaza in 2010, painting himself as caring and compassionate. But just months later, he left his family in London and headed out to Pakistan and Afghanistan. In his defence, he told the court he had been kidnapped by the Taliban, suspected of being a British spy and forced into making bombs. Brian Altman QC, prosecuting, said Ali's version was ""a preposterous story from beginning to end"" which was ""quite literally incredible - a story of riddles and nonsense"". The jury believed that prosecution assertion, finding Ali guilty on all three counts. He will be sentenced at a later date and faces the prospect of life in prison."

One of the men makes a grab towards the woman, who instantly pulls her child to safety, swinging the infant into her arms and running across the busy road to escape the men. The two men then retreat, running away, as a black car and red lorry both stop in the road. As the distressed woman waits on the pavement, four builders quickly jump out, with one grabbing scaffolding from the back of his lorry, and they all chase after the men on foot. Confirming that the attempted robbery was being investigated, a police spokesman said: ""Police were called at 12:35hrs on Thursday, 21 June to Sandpits Road in Petersham after a woman was approached by four men on a black moped and motorbike who demanded her jewellery.

The presenter retweeted Holden's post, saying the attempted robbery was ""disgusting"" and calling the perpetrators ""snivelling cowards"" and asked people to call the police if they knew the men's identities. Earlier this month, police confirmed that more than 60 crimes using mopeds or motorbikes were carried out every day in London on average over the past year. The comedian was with his son when hammer-wielding thieves smashed through his car window and reportedly snatched his watch.

Police have asked anyone with information to call them on 101 or to contact them anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
2018-06-26,Temperatures soared way past 30C in some areas as the UK enjoyed another day of a heatwave that shows no sign of cooling down. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180626220342/https://news.sky.com/story/britain-roasts-on-hottest-day-of-the-year-as-mercury-hits-306c-11418053,"Porthmadog in North Wales recorded a temperature of 30.6C, passing yesterday's top of 30.1C on the latest day in a heatwave week. The Met Office placed its heat health warning at level two - meaning social and healthcare services should be at the ready to alleviate some of the harmful impacts of a heatwave. In London, temperatures caused serious transport delays, and at Waterloo station commuters were faced with scenes of chaos with seriously delayed and sweltering trains crowded with passengers. The disruption was caused by overheating tracks, forcing trains to run between 20mph and 40mph slower than normal - leading to later trains and congestion. Beaches and parks were far more crowded than usual as people took advantage of the warm weather to top up their tans, relax in the sunshine or go for a dip. Many enjoyed temperatures hotter than Athens and on a par with Kuala Lumpur and Brazil's Rio. Temperatures are set to get even hotter and could reach 33C on Thursday - far more than the UK average of 17.3C for this time of year - and meteorologists say it is likely to continue into next month. ""At the moment it looks like that will be the general theme through much of July,"" Met Office spokesperson Alex Burkill said. ""Generally it looks like it will stay drier and warmer than average."" :: Dogs saved from 'blazing hot' car in York as police smash window Animal rights organisations have reminded pet owners that dogs can die in hot cars, and urged them to provide pets with plenty of water and to look out for the signs of heatstroke such as panting, glazed eyes and shaky legs. Authorities have also urged people to take care when keeping cool after a boy went missing at a lake in Stoke-on-Trent. Police are now searching for Ryan Evans, 13, and have warned people that swimming in open water can be dangerous. A fire on Saddleworth Moor also highlighted some of the costs of hot weather, with 50 firefighters and three wildfire units deployed to tackle a blaze that left a portion of hillside ""devastated"". Britons have also been reminded to drink plenty of liquids in the heat, apply suncream when outside, and keep an eye on elderly relatives who are likely more vulnerable to heatstroke. ""It's vitally important that we keep an eye on friends, family and neighbours who may be at risk, and chances are we'll all know someone if we're all going to stay well this summer,"" Dr Thomas Waite of Public Health England said."

More than 850,000 jobs directly and indirectly employed in the sector are at risk because of Brexit, the trade body warned, and called on the government to stick with the benefits of the single market. Chief executive Mike Hawes said: ""There is growing frustration in global boardrooms at the slow pace of negotiations. ""The current position, with conflicting messages and red lines, goes directly against the interests of the UK automotive sector which has thrived on single market and customs union membership."" BMW says it cannot manufacture its products in the UK if Brexit means its supply chain is disrupted. ""There is no credible plan B for frictionless customs arrangements, nor is it realistic to expect that new trade deals can be agreed with the rest of the world that will replicate the immense value of trade with the EU. ""Government must rethink its position on the customs union."" ""There is no Brexit dividend for our industry, particularly in what is an increasingly hostile and protectionist global trading environment. Our message to government is that until it can demonstrate exactly how a new model for customs and trade with the EU can replicate the benefits we currently enjoy, don't change it."" It's the latest call for clarity over Britain's future trading position with the European Union after German carmaker BMW warned it cannot manufacture its products in the UK if Brexit means its supply chain is disrupted. BMW employs almost 8,000 people and has four plants in the UK. Passenger jet maker Airbus has also warned it could also pull out of the UK with the loss of thousands of jobs if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal. Rebecca Long Bailey MP, Labour's shadow business secretary, said: ''The Government has refused to listen to the cries from businesses and unions for clarity in their Brexit negotiations and for a customs union to support jobs and industry. ""The Government must listen to businesses and unions, negotiate with the EU rather than amongst themselves, and secure a jobs first deal which keeps skilled jobs and successful industries in the UK.''"
2018-06-28,The amount of money given by the taxpayer to the Queen for official duties and other costs rose by 13% to £45.7m in the financial year to spring 2018.   ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180628124426/https://news.sky.com/story/the-queen-gets-a-bumper-pay-rise-from-the-public-to-help-repair-buckingham-palace-11419338,"Part of the increase in the Sovereign Grant was to meet the cost of renovations at Buckingham Palace, which are expected to take up to ten years. Her majesty's total expenditure rose from £41.9m to £47.4m for the year 2017/18 of which £22.6 million went on property maintenance. Travel was another major cost for the royal household, rising to £4.7m, the most expensive single trip being £362,149 for the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall to visit India, Malaysia, Brunei and Singapore between October 29 and November 11 last year. Sir Michael Stevens, the new keeper of the Privy Purse, who oversees the monarch's finances, said: ""There are three generations of the royal family at work together in support of the Queen. ""Each generation brings its own style and personality. What everyone shares is a desire for the monarchy to reflect and serve all parts of our country and the wider Commonwealth."" A budget of £369m has been set for the refurbishment of Buckingham Palace, including the replacement of the decades-old wiring system. Part of that cost is being met by an increase in the percentage of the Crown Estate profits paid to the Sovereign Grant. The Crown Estate is a collection of land and property nominally owned by the Queen, but in fact independently managed with the cash going to the Treasury rather than the monarch. In the 2017/18 tax year it benefited the public purse to the tune of £329.4m, an increase of four percent on the previous year."

Using the pseudonym 'XNDA' the 33-year-old duets with Aguilera on Pipe. He is also credited as a writer on the track, which includes the raunchy lyrics: ""You know I've got a wild imagination/ I like to play the Doctor Operation/ Spread it on the bed like a patient/ I'm about to show you domination."" Aguilera has said in interviews that she was sworn to secrecy about the real identity of XNDA, but had been ""dying for ev­eryone to find out as they're definitely multi-talented"". Hamilton is thought to have previously worked with Jay Z and Kanye West but this is the first time audiences have heard his voice. Aguilera, 37, said she became friends with Hamilton after performing at an F1 concert. They were also pictured together at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix in April this year. Pipe has been described by the New York Times as a ""single-entendre"" track, due to its raciness and explicit lyrics, in which XNDA sing-songs ""up and down a few notes"". The Genie In A Bottle singer gave her thoughts about the track in a tweet earlier this month, saying: ""Love vibing out to this one- Had so much fun exploring different textures & tones in my voice stylistically. ""Tapping into a certain kind of flow and flirtation. This song is both wordplay and foreplay."" Hamilton was previously in a long-term relationship with the singer Nicole Scherzinger but the two never spent time in a studio together."
2018-06-28,Food and drink companies are having to put plans in place to minimise disruption to customers who want to drink beer and have barbecues this summer.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180628124426/https://news.sky.com/story/the-co2-shortage-will-we-run-out-of-beer-and-food-11419450,"Dwindling stocks of CO2 couldn't come at a worse time, as the UK basks in hot, sunny weather and the nation tunes in to the World Cup, wanting to celebrate England's success with a beer or two. What has caused the shortage? The low supplies are due to a longer than usual break in production of ammonia, one of the key sources of Europe's food grade CO2 - which is used to carbonate drinks and preserve some packed fresh foods. Trade journal Gasworld says the shortage has been described as the ""worst supply situation to hit the European carbon dioxide business in decades"". There are five major sources of CO2 within the UK in which the main gas companies have liquid CO2 production facilities. Over the past month it has only been the two plants near Manchester that have been operational, but Gasworld says two in Teesside are due to reopen this week. What is affected? 1. Beer and soft drinks Food and drink companies are trying to minimise disruption to customers, especially at a time of record hot temperatures and World Cup mania. Some Wetherspoon pubs are temporarily without draught John Smith's and Strongbow cider, while Punch Taverns, which has about 1,300 pubs, says it has also experienced a shortage of John Smith's, along with Amstel and Birra Moretti. Some pub landlords say they have not encountered shortages like this in decades of trading. However, not all pub suppliers are affected so the severity of the problem varies even down to a very local level. The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) says that while stocks of the gas remain low, brewers are ""working their socks"" off to ensure the beer continues to flow. BBPA chief executive Brigid Simmonds said: ""The UK can produce as much as 10 million pints of beer per day, and with signs of things improving, pubs will certainly not be running dry. ""Our message to beer drinkers and England fans is clear: keep calm and carry on going to the pub. If your usual beer of choice isn't available, then why not use it as an opportunity to try something new?"" Coca Cola has paused some production lines but says its supply has not been disrupted and it can continue to fulfil customer orders. 2. Farming Poultry slaughterhouses have already called for priority supplies of dwindling CO2 stocks, saying the current shortage could have a ""potentially huge effect"" on British food production. Scotland's largest pig processing plant, Quality Pork Limited, in Angus, suspended its slaughtering process due to a lack of the gas, which is used to stun animals before they are killed. British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) chief executive Nick Allen has said the situation is getting ""pretty tight"", exacerbated by the hot temperatures. 3. Packaging Carbon dioxide is widely used in ""modified atmosphere packaging"". It is part of a gas mixture which is used to remove oxygen from food packaging to prolong the shelf life and keep food looking fresh. Morrisons and Ocado have told customers that the shortage had led to disruption to some frozen product lines. A spokeswoman for the British Retail Consortium (BRC) has said CO2 supply issues remain and that retailers and suppliers are working hard to ensure food availability is maintained. ""We are aware of specific pressures in some areas such as carbonated soft drinks, beer, British chicken and British pork but the majority of food products are unaffected and retailers do not anticipate food shortages,"" the BRC said. ""However, it is likely that the mix of products available may be affected."" 4. Dry ice The Glasgow Science Centre (GSC) visitor attraction has said it was unable to get the dry ice it needed for its new show, due to the CO2 supply issues. Dry ice is also used to keep food chilled when it is in transit and some supermarkets, including Ocado, have rationed frozen food sales. Frozen food specialist Iceland said it was not affected by the shortage because it uses refrigerated vehicles instead of dry ice. Dry ice is also popular among singers who want to make an entrance when coming on stage during concerts. It is not known if the music industry will be affected. Will we run out of food and drink? It is unlikely. Most shortages so far have been short-term. Gasworld chief executive John Raquet believes there is ""light very much at the end of the tunnel"" and that abattoirs, bottling plants and breweries should see an improvement in supply early next week. ""Clearly, there will be a backlog of processing to catch up with and that will take some time - especially within the all important abattoirs - but they should see product deliveries next week,"" he said."
2018-06-28,"British intelligence officers knew about - and on occasions witnessed - the mistreatment of suspected terrorists after 9/11, but did too little to stop or prevent it, a report has found.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180628124426/https://news.sky.com/story/uk-tolerated-inexcusable-treatment-of-terror-detainees-after-911-11419530,"A long overdue report on detainee mistreatment and rendition, from parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC), concludes those at the top of MI6, MI5 and Defence Intelligence knew about ""the pattern of mistreatment by the US"" and ""tolerated"" it. According to the report, between the 2001 terror attacks in the US and 2010, there were: The committee said: ""The 27 conclusions contained in the body of this Report outline some serious concerns: in our view the UK tolerated actions, and took others, that we regard as inexcusable."" However, the report concluded there was not any evidence to indicate ""UK agency officers or defence intelligence personnel directly carried out physical mistreatment of detainees"". From 2002, UK intelligence officers from MI6, MI5 and the Ministry of Defence (MOD), participated in an estimated 2-3,000 interviews of detainees, held by the US at locations in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay. On rendition, the practice of secretly flying a detainee to another country without trial, the report said there was no ""smoking gun"" to indicate that the agencies ""deliberately overlooked reports of mistreatment and rendition by the US as a matter of institutional policy"". But, ""there was no understanding in HMG [Her Majesty's Government] of rendition and no clear policy - or even recognition of the need for one"", it added. The report stated: ""We have found three individual cases where SIS [Secret Intelligence Service or MI6] or MI5 made, or offered to make, a financial contribution to others to conduct a rendition operation. ""Given the countries concerned, these can be described as 'extraordinary renditions' due to the real risk of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatments. ""There is no evidence that any US rendition flight transited the UK with a detainee onboard. ""Two detainees are now known to have transferred through Diego Garcia: we have seen nothing to indicate that detainees have ever been held on Diego Garcia [a military facility in the Indian Ocean], although the records are woefully inadequate."" The committee took 50 hours of oral evidence over the past three years, reviewed 4,000 documents and devoted 30,000 staff hours to the inquiry. It took evidence from former detainees and three former intelligence officers, but criticised the government for denying them access to some witnesses. The chairman of the ISC, former attorney general and Tory MP Dominic Grieve, said it was easy to criticise with hindsight. ""We wish to be absolutely clear that we do not seek to blame individual officers acting under immense pressure,"" he said. ""Our findings must be viewed in the context in which events took place. ""The pace of work after 9/11, both in Afghanistan and London, was frenetic: we do not underestimate the pressure that the agencies experienced whilst dealing with the imperative to protect the UK and prevent another attack on the scale of 9/11."" In a second report that examines the current situation, also released on Thursday, the ISC concludes that the agencies have implemented changes to prevent it happening again. ""Whilst there is room for improvement, very few countries have attempted to set out their approach to these matters, and let themselves be held accountable in this manner,"" it said. ""It is to the agencies' and the MOD's credit that they have embedded these procedures."" Responding to the ISC reports, Corey Stoughton, advocacy director at civil liberties campaign group Liberty, said: ""As the committee itself bemoans, the government crippled this inquiry from the start, constraining its scope, withholding critical information, and creating obstacles to a full and complete reckoning on the UK's complicity in torture. ""But even with such limited access to the people and materials they needed to get to the truth, the committee has delivered two stinging reports into what it terms 'inexcusable' conduct. ""Their pages make for distressing reading, but we still haven't got to the bottom of the UK's involvement in the unforgivable mistreatment of people around the world. ""Ministers must finally instigate the promised independent judge-led inquiry to delve deeper into our country's involvement in torture and rendition."" Prior to the publication of the ISC reports, Mr Grieve dismissed claims there were any significant last-minute changes at the request of US officials."

He is currently in hospital for treatment but will be taken to a north London police station for questioning, ""At this early stage officers retain an open mind as to motive,"" a Scotland Yard spokesman said. The victim's next of kin have been informed and a post mortem is due to take place. Extra officers will be on patrol in the local area and police have appealed for witnesses to come forward.

2018-06-28,"Inevitably, with today's profits warning from the John Lewis Partnership, there will be speculation that the owner of the eponymous department stores and the Waitrose grocery chain is being blasted by the hurricanes that have afflicted so many of its competitors.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180628124426/https://news.sky.com/story/why-the-john-lewis-partnership-is-not-in-crisis-11418772,"During recent years, BHS and Allders have vanished from the high street, House of Fraser is shutting more than half its stores and Debenhams now has a stock market valuation equal to less than five weeks of its sales. Surely the John Lewis department store chain, arguably Britain's best-loved retailer, must also be struggling? Not necessarily, argues Sir Charlie Mayfield, chairman of the Partnership. What today's announcement is all about is adapting to changing times and future-proofing the business. That means investing heavily in IT - a significant factor behind the escalation in costs that will contribute to half-year profits being wiped out - and also in changes to the store estate. This latter factor does not mean a wave of store closures, as some have suggested in the wake of today's news that four Waitrose convenience stores and one small supermarket are to close, but means doing other things with the stores. Sir Charlie points out that, with the Partnership owning a lot of its sites, it is well-placed to build some sites higher, potentially enabling it to let out space for other uses, or even develop flats and apartments that can be sold. Future-proofing the Partnership also means sacrificing profits in the short term in order to invest in the long-term. Sir Charlie wants the Partnership to invest between £400m-£500m a year which, he says, will means the Partnership's level of capital investment, as a proportion of sales, will be more than 10% ahead of its competitors. This, he argues, is a strength of the partnership model. John Lewis Partnership is owned by its 85,500 employees and, as such, is under less pressure than stock market-listed competitors to generate short-term returns. Take any high-profile retailer that has experienced difficulties in recent years and, somewhere along the way, a lack of investment will have contributed - whether that is the failure of the likes of BHS, Allders and House of Fraser to stay relevant to customers or a refusal on the part of Asda to sacrifice profit margins in the short term to defend its market share in the face of competition from the hard discounters Aldi and Lidl. The other real significance in today's announcement is that the Partnership clearly plans very little addition to floor space. The 50 John Lewis department stores it has is clearly deemed sufficient for its needs and, while Sir Charlie was at pains to stress that the gleaming new John Lewis store at the Westfield shopping centre in west London will not be the last store opening, it is likely to be one of the last. Similarly, Waitrose will not be adding dramatically to its core estate of 353 shops, a dramatic change from the ambitions expressed by its former managing director, Mark Price, who only four years ago was talking in terms of doubling the size of its store estate from 300 to 600. Instead, Sir Charlie argues that both Waitrose and the John Lewis department stores will have to focus on ""differentiation not scale"", fighting for customers not by being the biggest players in their field but by offering a real point of difference. The department stores will, in time, raise the proportion of its sales coming from own-brand or exclusive products from 30% to 50% while Waitrose will also be looking to raise the proportion of products that are own-brand from the current 50% or so. A stroll around John Lewis in Westfield gives a good indication of what the Partnership hopes to achieve. While everything that one would expect to see in a John Lewis store is there, there is also a lot of space devoted to services, providing advice and making shopping a more personal experience. In the jargon, John Lewis wants to deepen the relationship it has with its customers. Some of these changes are going to be painful for partners. One of the ways in which the Partnership aims to strengthen its balance sheet will be a review of its legendarily generous pension scheme. Profits may also be eroded at the department stores, famous for their 'Never Knowingly Undersold' prices pledge, as the likes of House of Fraser close underperforming stores and announce stock liquidation sales. But there are already signs that the extra investment is paying off. While profits are going to be down this year as a whole at the department stores, Sir Charlie expects them to be up at Waitrose, marking a turnaround from the tough trading the up-market grocer suffered in 2017. He says this reflects an end to some of the more aggressive discounting and customer offers Waitrose had resorted to and a strong improvement, as a result of investment, in product availability. Despite the headline drop in profits that is expected this year, the John Lewis Partnership is not in crisis. Sir Charlie hopes the measures announced today will ensure that continues to be the case."
2018-06-28,The former Government minister who was drafted in as the City's top EU envoy is to step down this summer amid continued uncertainty about a post-Brexit deal for the financial services industry.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180628124426/https://news.sky.com/story/citys-brexit-envoy-to-step-down-months-before-eu-departure-11419627,"Sky News has learnt that Jeremy Browne, who served at the Foreign Office during the 2010-2015 coalition administration, will leave the City of London Corporation at the end of August. Mr Browne is quitting at the conclusion of his original three-year‎ contract despite recent speculation among financial services executives that his term would be extended until after the UK's departure. His exit will come at a perilous time for the Brexit negotiations, with Theresa May in Brussels for an EU Council meeting on Thursday that is not expected to yield any meaningful progress. ‎The City, like other crucial sectors of the British economy, has become increasingly fearful about the possibility of a 'no deal' Brexit because of its implications for companies' ability to trade and move executives freely across borders. This week, UK financial regulators became embroiled in a public row with European counterparts about the preparedness of British firms for the post-Brexit period. ‎Mr Browne was hired by the Corporation on a six-figure salary to act as a senior London-based liaison between the City and Brussels. As its special representative to the EU, he has written regular memos detailing accounts of his discussions with key officials in EU capitals, many of which have struck a pessimistic ‎tone about the progress of negotiations on both sides of the table. His departure will come as the City of London Corporation progresses the appointment of a new senior figure to be based in Brussels, a role that was originally intended to work alongside Mr Browne. Sources said Mr Browne was now unlikely to be directly replaced, with the new Brussels-based executive expected to be drawn from the ranks of government affairs officials at a major City firm. The Corporation has had an office in Brussels since 2004, but the proposed recruitment of a senior figure illustrates the determination of City officials to ensure that London's financial services sector is adequately represented during a crucial period. Major investment banks and asset managers have already begun to move small numbers of people to new EU-based trading hubs and representative offices as they prepare for a range of potential outcomes in the Brexit discussions. Influential figures in the European Commission and member states including France and Germany want to take big chunks of lucrative markets such as euroclearing away from London. Meanwhile, many bosses in the British banking, insurance and asset management sectors believe that the progress of the Brexit negotiations to date risks propelling the UK towards a no-deal departure from the EU. The PM and other Cabinet ministers have held periodic talks with senior City executives in an attempt to reassure them, but many believe that time is running out if they are to avoid triggering irreversible contingency plans. A document prepared for the Corporation and seen by Sky News last year revealed its plans to ""put the City in the best possible position to have an ongoing constructive relationship with the EU27"". ""As the UK‎ leaves the EU, the representational model for the City and UK financial and professional services in Brussels will need to change,"" the Corporation document said. ""It is critical that the City delivers a single, coherent message in Brussels as far as possible."" Mr Browne and a Corporation spokeswoman declined to comment on Thursday."

More than 2,600 tickets have been sold through the Football Association alone after the turnout for the opening game was believed to be England's lowest at a World Cup for 30 years. England fan Will Tomlinson, 34, who has travelled to Russia, said he hoped for an English influx as the team progressed through the tournament. ""We've got loads of friends who were umming and ahhing whether to come,"" he said. ""We want to see every England fan coming over, especially now we are playing well."" Homes, pubs and big screen areas across England are expected to be packed on Thursday evening, while Downing Street has confirmed it will fly a St George's flag during the match. Sky's Enda Brady says he has seen no sign of the ultras and hooligans that certain sections of the UK press have been obsessing over. Prime Minister Theresa May will be in Brussels for a European Union summit at the same time as the game, but a senior UK official said she would be made aware of the score ""if needs be"". Belgium, managed by Roberto Martinez, and England are expected to rest players as they are both already through to the last 16. Some fans have argued it would be better to finish second in the group to avoid the same side of the draw as Brazil, France, Argentina, Portugal and Uruguay. But Sir Clive Woodward, who coached England's rugby union team to World Cup victory, urged Gareth Southgate's side to play for the win. ""World Cups are all about momentum,"" he said. ""England must prepare and approach this game versus Belgium as if it was a knock out match - top the group and then and only then think about your next opponent. ""This is such an important game to keep momentum going."" Speaking before the game, manager Southgate said he wanted to ""breed a mentality that everybody in our squad wants to constantly win"". ""We've not won a knockout game since 2006,"" he said. ""Why we are starting to plot which would be a better venue for our semi-final is beyond me, really."" If England and Belgium draw the match, the group winners will be decided by their fair play record - with the Three Lions currently on one fewer yellow card. ""If I go and headbutt Roberto in the last five minutes, then you'll know that maybe we're taking a different approach to getting through,"" Southgate joked. ""We want to win the game. That would mean we top the group and we would go into whatever game we go into moving forward."" England play Belgium at Kaliningrad Stadium at 7pm UK time."

He also said: ""We are aware of allegations of insider trading in Carillion's shares prior to its trading update on July 10 2017 and are looking into them."" Insider dealing - also known as insider trading - is an illegal practice whereby a person could potentially use confidential information for their own financial benefit through share trades. A joint inquiry by the work and pensions and business committees concluded last month that the company's demise on 15 January, with debts of up to £7bn including £2.6bn in pension liabilities, was primarily down to the actions of the board and a series of oversight failures. Just days ago The Pensions Regulator (TPR) - among the bodies accused by MPs of being too timid in its approach to Carillion - said it was considering issuing a demand for former Carillion directors to contribute to the company's pension black hole."

Richard William Stanton, Robert Charles Harper and John Volanthen entered the cave in full kit before emerging about an hour later. ""We've got a job to do,"" Mr Volanthen said as he went into the tunnel, declining to speak further. Heavy rain has hampered the search and some of the rescue divers have been forced to turn back after floodwater seeped into a second chamber of the caves. The children, aged between 11 and 16, and their 25-year-old football coach went into the cave on Saturday and were trapped when heavy rains saw the main entrance flooded. The British Cave Rescue Council (BCRC)is co-ordinating the UK response. Tony Haigh, the BCRC's communications officer, told Sky News UK divers are used to diving in the challenging conditions found in many UK caves and can conduct dives in low visibility conditions and in small passages. A team of US military personnel from US Pacific Command, including para-rescue and survival specialists, are also helping the operation. ""Operators are trained in personnel recovery tactics and techniques and procedures,"" Jillian Bonnardeaux from the US embassy told AFP. ""Essentially what they're looking at is assessing with the Thai authorities the potential courses of action and complementing the efforts underway,"" she added. ""The divers are now ready to go in as soon as the water drops to a suitable level,"" Thai Navy SEAL said on its Facebook page on Thursday. Exhausted relatives have been camped out near the cave's entrance for days desperately awaiting news about the missing team and their coach. ""I'm sad. I want (my son) to be safe, we've heard nothing from officials yet,"" Thinnakorn, the father of a 12-year-old in the cave, told AFP. Border guards with police dogs scoured the site for new openings into the cave, which is several miles long. Families brought clothing belonging to the kids to help the sniffer dogs find the team. Search teams found three new holes this week, but only one of the chimneys was accessible. The Tham Luang cave is a popular draw for local visitors during the dry season, though a sign at the entrance warns tourists not to enter during the wet season from July to November."

On the front of the Süddeutsche Zeitung, ""Historische Pleite"", roughly meaning ""historically bankrupt"", alongside a picture of Timo Werner clutching his head in frustration. There was a more straight and to the point headline on the Frankfurter Allgemeine, which writes ""Germany eliminated in the group stage"". On the top of the homepage for Die Zeit, the headline translates as ""the end of self-glorification"". It adds: ""Helpless, bloodless, mediocre. German football is less good than many think. Maybe it needed this World Cup finish to see that. And to win again.""

2018-06-28,"Standing downwind from a small section of the Saddleworth Moor fire, my eyes are streaming.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180628124426/https://news.sky.com/story/physically-exhausting-fighting-saddleworth-moor-fire-11419305,"From our vantage point - through the thick acrid smoke - you can see the homes where people were evacuated from on Tuesday night. On the moor here, the ground is blackened. Firefighters have spent an entire day dampening down the blaze. There are no flames now but the ground still hasn't stopped smoking. At the foot of this part of the moor, throughout the day we've spent time with the crews as they came down the hill to rest. To get a drink. To take a breather. They've worked solidly - a back breaking effort of dragging rolls of hoses across the shrubland to get to those off-road areas that their trucks simply can't reach. Walking up and down the hill again and again and again. It is exhausting, yet they're joking - they're not overwhelmed by the enormous task that faces them. Firefighter David Sutton told me: ""It is physically exhausting, it's so hot up there, it's tough terrain. ""We do a rotation shift so luckily this is my first day but I'm expecting to be here tomorrow and for the next two nights. ""It's too dangerous for us to be on the moors after darkness. It's frustrating. You don't want to leave the fire but it's necessary for everyone's safety."" His colleague Dave Price told me that slowly it has felt like they're making in-roads. ""We've been fairly lucky today, the wind direction has been good to us. We've had a line of hose and the fire beaters but the beaters aren't all that good."" He admitted that the peat fire was challenging. ""It burns down so you can think it's gone out but then it pops up in other areas. You don't want to walk on it either because there can be holes."" At the end of his shift, firefighter Damian Bruntso summed up the hardworking mentality of the crews that are on the ground here. ""We've managed it today. There will be crews here to make sure residents feel protected now overnight. We've wet down the area so if it flares up the residents will be protected. ""I can't say I'm filled with joy about coming back tomorrow but that's what we do. It'll be another day of hard work but we'll be here."""

Two of the boys died in hospital. The Xuhui district public security office said the other boy and the woman survived and did not have life-threatening injuries. Flowers were left at the scene, with one message reading: ""Child, there is no suffering in heaven. Hope that everything will be well for you in heaven."" The attacker was caught with the help of a passer-by. Police said the man, whose surname was given as Huang, carried out the attack to ""take revenge on society"".

Hero bus driver Oliver Salbris, who managed to swerve his double decker to avoid the woman, told Sky News he was ""certain"" the push was deliberate. The Metropolitan Police said it had now closed its investigation after admitting it had ""exhausted"" all lines of inquiry. A force spokesman told Sky News: ""Officers looked at over 50 people of interest during the course of the investigation; all of them were researched, reviewed and eventually eliminated. ""The matter was investigated fully with all reasonable lines of enquiry completed. ""As a suspect has not been identified and as all lines of enquiry have now been exhausted, the investigation has been closed. ""Should any new information come to light, this will be explored."" The 33-year-old victim was left with minor injuries following the incident, which happened at 7.40am on 5 May 2017. Around 15 minutes after the incident, the jogger ran back over the bridge, but ignored the woman when she tried to speak to him and carried on jogging towards the north side of the river. In December, Mr Salbris urged the mystery attacker to give himself up to police. ""He should come forward and talk to the police,"" the bus driver said. ""He has done something bad and the consequences could have been terrible for the victim and me. ""It would be good if the police could catch him, but if only he could reproach himself, search his conscience, at least be responsible for his actions."" The victim fell backwards with her head in the road, in the path of Mr Salbris's number 430 bus, and only inches away from his front wheel. ""I don't know why the jogger pushed her, perhaps he was having a bad day and decided to push the first lady he saw. It could have been personal, too,"" said Mr Salbris. ""I really don't know how someone could do something like that to somebody else."" The suspect was described as a white man with brown eyes and short brown hair, who was in his early to mid-30s. He was wearing a light grey T-shirt and dark blue shorts with grey trainers. Three men were arrested in connection with the incident but were later released without charge."

The genetic disorder - which affects just one in 10,000 babies in the UK - means he is unable to break down an amino acid in protein that can reach dangerous concentrations in his blood. Now Stanley's family have called for the NHS to offer a drug called Kuvan which has successfully treated PKU sufferers across Europe. It comes after a High Court ruling last year forced the NHS to review its decision to refuse to fund the treatment for an autistic seven-year-old boy with PKU. Mrs Brown, from Halesowen in the West Midlands, told Sky News: ""This treatment would be life-changing for Stanley. ""To pay for it ourselves, it would cost £15,000 a year while Stanley is little. That would go up to £30,000 a year when he's an adult. ""But even if we could afford it, the systems are not in place to allow for it to be administered. ""Why are we failing to offer treatment that is available in so many other countries? My little boy needs it."" Mrs Brown said Stanley has to avoid eating meats, nuts, fish and dairy products because of his condition and even some vegetables are restricted. ""Everywhere we go we have to take our own food,"" she added. ""It's huge pressure for myself and my husband, as well as Stanley's grandparents and his nursery because if he has too much protein it is extremely dangerous."" Kuvan was licensed in 2008 and is used as a standard treatment for PKU in a host of European countries, according to the National Society for Phenylketonuria (NSPKU). They include Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and Ukraine, the charity says. The NHS is due to re-evaluate the funding of Kuvan later this year, according to NSPKU. A spokeswoman for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which approves drugs made available on the NHS, said: ""At the request of NHS England, NICE has been asked to look at Kuvan as part of its topic selection process. ""The topic is scheduled to be discussed by the group in September. If there is consensus reached with all the decision makers, work will begin on the appraisal in September."" NHS England declined to comment when approached by Sky News. :: A group of MPs on Thursday are taking part in a diet challenge to limit their protein intake to 10g a day to raise awareness of the difficulties of living with PKU."
2018-06-28,The competition watchdog is launching enforcement action against a number of hotel booking sites which it believes may be breaking the law. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180628124426/https://news.sky.com/story/online-hotel-booking-sites-investigated-over-misleading-claims-11419333,"As part of an ongoing investigation, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has identified widespread concerns about the practice of reserving a room online. This includes: :: How hotels are ranked in search results :: The pressure put on consumers to buy when they see claims about how many rooms are left or how many people are viewing the same room :: Whether discount claims offer a fair comparison and the extent to which sites include all costs in the price they first show The chief executive of the CMA, Andrea Coscelli, said: ""Booking sites can make it so much easier to choose your holiday, but only if people are able to trust them. ""Holidaymakers must feel sure they're getting the deal they expected, whether that's securing the discount promised or receiving reliable information about availability of rooms. ""It's also important that no one feels pressured by misleading statements into making a booking. ""That's why we're now demanding that sites think again about how they're presenting information to their customers and make sure they're complying with the law. ""Our next step is to take any necessary action - including through the courts if needed - to ensure people get a fair deal."" The CMA hasn't identified the hotel booking sites it is investigating but says it is demanding that they take action to address its concerns. Guy Anker from Money Saving Expert believes tough action is needed to protect the consumer. He said: ""We are pleased to see action is being taken. The key thing is people have to be able to trust hotel booking sites. ""I would stress that they are still one of the best ways of booking a hotel, you very quickly find out the cheapest price but you might have to do an additional click to make sure you are really getting that price. ""We have found consumers are getting the wrong price, which means it is so difficult to compare. The CMA needs to root out the problem so the first price you see is genuinely what you get."""

All customers the company believes were affected - less than 5% of its customer base - have been contacted and advised to change their password. In a statement on their website, Ticketmaster added customers in North America were not affected. The company offered 12 months free identity monitoring service to anyone whose details may have been stolen. The statement said: ""On Saturday, June 23, 2018, Ticketmaster UK identified malicious software on a customer support product hosted by Inbenta Technologies, an external third-party supplier to Ticketmaster. ""As soon as we discovered the malicious software, we disabled the Inbenta product across all Ticketmaster websites."" :: Hackers access 5.9m bank cards at Dixons Carphone It went on to say: ""As a result of Inbenta's product running on Ticketmaster International websites, some of our customers' personal or payment information may have been accessed by an unknown third-party."" A spokesperson for the National Cyber Security Centre said they were aware of the incident and working with partners to understand what happened. Ticketmaster added that it is working with relevant authorities, as well as credit card companies and banks, and had its own forensics teams and experts analysing the breach. While the breach mainly affected UK customers, the company said those overseas were also being advised to change their passwords. It said anyone who attempted to buy tickets between February and 23 June of this year, and international customers who bought or tried to buy tickets between September 2017 and 23 June 2018 could have been affected. The software was running on Ticketmaster International, Ticketmaster UK, GETMEIN! and TicketWeb. Affected data includes name, address, email address, telephone number, payment details and Ticketmaster login details. Responding to the breach Leigh-Anne Galloway, a cyber security resilience expert at Positive Technologies, said: ""Ecommerce merchants like Ticketmaster are a classic target, because of the valuable payment information they hold. ""If you've used Ticketmaster, you should quickly change your passwords and closely monitor your bank account for suspicious activity. ""Personal data is sold on the internet in bulk, so if you use that password for any other sites you should also change those sites as well."""
2018-06-28,Stagecoach has revealed an £85.6m hit on the back of the government's decision to take back control of the East Coast mainline.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180628124426/https://news.sky.com/story/stagecoach-takes-856m-hit-on-virgin-east-coast-11419382,"The company - which held 90% of the Virgin Trains East Coast venture - used its annual results to reveal the sum, admitting it was disappointed but arguing it was ""significantly influenced by factors outside of our control"". It was announced by the transport secretary Chris Grayling last month that the contract would be ripped up - with a public Operator of Last Resort to run the service instead under the historic LNER brand. The renationalisation took effect last Sunday. The decision was blamed on the private operators losing money by failing to meet their revenue targets - with Mr Grayling saying they had ""got their bid wrong"". Headwinds included lower-than-expected demand in a slowing economy. Stagecoach told Sky News the £85.6m charge it had taken to cover the cost of the East Coast franchise took its total expected loss on the contract to around £200m. The company did not expect that figure to rise. Stagecoach said on Thursday: ""We regret the losses the group has experienced on the East Coast franchise, notwithstanding that these were significantly influenced by factors outside of our control. ""We have examined our bid for and operation of the franchise closely and have also looked more broadly at our rail bid governance. ""We involved external advisors in that and we have made changes to our processes to strengthen our approach to bidding and contract management in UK rail. ""The lessons learnt have been reflected in our subsequent bids."" The company's results for the year to 28 April showed statutory profit before tax rising significantly to £95.3m because of a drop in one-off costs. However they dropped 4% on an underlying basis. Stagecoach shares - down by more than a fifth in the year to date - fell by as much as 6.5% in early trading on Thursday. The company slashed its final dividend and warned that operating profits in its rail division - which fell almost 13% in its last financial year - were on track to fall further in 2018/19 because of the costs of bidding for new franchises. Chief executive Martin Griffiths said: ""I am disappointed to be reporting significant exceptional costs in respect of Virgin Trains East Coast but I am pleased that there is now clarity for both customers and shareholders. ""We have made significant progress elsewhere in our rail portfolio and continue to see value and opportunities. ""We welcome the positive changes by the Department for Transport to ensure a more balanced share of revenue risk between the Department and UK train operators. ""We are continuing work on bids for new South Eastern, West Coast Partnership and East Midlands rail franchises and we will maintain a disciplined approach to all rail bids."""

A rapid response car and ambulance were damaged during the violence and more crews had to be sent to the scene as back-up. The first responders were left ""extremely shaken"", according to the South Central Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust. Police were called by the service and got into the property, where it was confirmed the original cardiac arrest call had been a hoax. The crew has hit out at those responsible for the violence and wasting valuable resources. The vehicle's wing mirror was broken and mud was thrown across its side in Telford. It released an image of the scene, with some of the items that were thrown during the incident scattered on the ground. It said on Facebook on Wednesday: ""It beggars belief what happened to our staff in Eastleigh earlier this evening.

Chargemaster currently operates 6,500 charging points nationwide. BP's investment - which follows similar moves by rivals including Shell - is the culmination of growing pressure globally for manufacturers to ditch petrol and diesel-powered vehicles. The issue was brought to a head after Volkswagen's dieselgate scandal which saddled the industry with additional scrutiny over emissions. VW, along with most other major brands, have since announced a research and development focus on electric technology despite worries that the cars have limited distance capability - typically no more than 200 miles - before batteries need to be recharged. BP said the charging points it was to install were capable of delivering 100 miles of range in just 10 minutes and its investment was based on forecasts that electric vehicle use was to accelerate markedly over the next 22 years. Its research suggested there would be 12 million on the UK's roads alone by 2040 - the date when the government has signalled it intends to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel models to help the environment. Tufan Erginbilgic, chief executive of BP's downstream business, said: ""Bringing together the UK's leading fuel retailer and its largest charging company, BP Chargemaster will deliver a truly differentiated offer for the country's growing number of electric vehicle owners. ""At BP we believe that fast and convenient charging is critical to support the successful adoption of electric vehicles. ""Combining BP's and Chargemaster's complementary expertise, experience and assets is an important step towards offering fast and ultra-fast charging at BP sites across the UK and to BP becoming the leading provider of energy to low carbon vehicles, on the road or at home."" David Martell, Chargemaster's chief executive, added: ""The acquisition of Chargemaster by BP marks a true milestone in the move towards low carbon motoring in the UK. ""I am truly excited to lead the Chargemaster team into a new era backed by the strength and scale of BP, which will help us maintain our market-leading position and grow the national POLAR charging network to support the large range of exciting new electric vehicles that are coming to market in the next couple of years."""

It says that 31,000 children are classed as ""problem gamblers"" and 45,000 are at risk of becoming one, and calls on the government to give gambling the same attention as it has given cyber bullying, pornography and extremism. :: Coral gambling ads banned for appealing to children The research also revealed that 91% of 11-15 year olds had seen betting adverts on TV or social media, and that 2% of those said the adverts had either prompted them to gamble for the first time, or had increased their gambling. ""Ideally, children and young people should not be exposed to marketing and advertising for gambling at all, let alone in the quantities now prevalent,"" the report states. ""The potential longer-term effects of what has been a relatively recent phenomenon are unknown. There is good reason to think they might be harmful."" The board, which advises the Gambling Commission, said that by not taking action there was a danger of ""inadvertently conducting an uncontrolled social experiment on today's youth, the outcome of which is uncertain but could be significant"". :: Why the gambling industry should accept the need for change Under 18s in the UK can legally buy lottery tickets and scratchcards and can also play on fruit machines, making the UK ""unusual by international standards"". The study authors called this a ""historical accident"" which they would not recommend ""if starting from scratch"". Half the young people who gambled last week did so illegally, with 13% gambling online, the report found. Of the children who used their parent's accounts, 43% did so without permission. ""There is a strong case for further action to reduce both the visibility of gambling marketing and advertising to children and young people and its impact,"" the report says. ""The increased volume of exposure online, including through social media, should be a priority."" The board has called on operators and the Gambling Commission to be more proactive in helping to protect children and to look at sports sponsorship because of its visibility to children. The report comes as it was announced that fines against gambling operators in the UK have risen from £1.6 million to £18 million in a year as the regulator cracks down on money laundering and unfair practices."
