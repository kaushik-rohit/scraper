2018-02-01,A prisoner who was stabbed to death at Wormwood Scrubs has been named as Saleh Khader.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180202063703/https://news.sky.com/story/murder-probe-launched-after-stabbing-at-wormwood-scrubs-prison-11231916,"Officers and ambulance crews were called to the west London prison at 3.19pm on Wednesday, but the 25-year-old was pronounced dead at the scene. An investigation has now been launched, and four inmates at the category B jail have been arrested on suspicion of murder. The men - two 21-year-olds, a 20-year-old and a 23-year-old - remain in police custody. Scotland Yard said Khader's next of kin have been informed, and a post-mortem examination will be arranged in due course. News of Khader's death came after a report by the prison's Independent Monitoring Board described it as ""a dangerous environment for staff and prisoners alike, with multiple violent incidents on most days"". The report, published last November, said the prison remained a ""dangerous place"" with 40 to 50 violent incidents in a typical month. At the time, the prison - which has about 1,200 male inmates - was said to be ""consistently"" short of staff. The report added: ""Managers and officers are expected to work - and prisoners are expected to live - in unacceptable conditions, which are not only indecent but also represent a threat to the security of the prison."" It also said that Carillion, the organisation contracted for maintenance services to Wormwood Scrubs, which collapsed earlier this month, was ""not able to adequately maintain the fabric of the prison""."
2018-02-01,"The good news is that inequality in Britain isn't getting worse. The bad news it that it isn't getting better, either. It's just getting different.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180202063703/https://news.sky.com/story/inequality-in-the-uk-is-not-getting-worse-but-it-is-changing-11232312,"That's the main theme to come out of the latest batch of wealth analysis by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). It's a very comprehensive 69-page appraisal of how the nation's wealth is distributed within British society, and how the picture is changing. And in some places, the answer is that it is not changing all that much. A striking fact of this year's report is that the top 10% of the nation has as much wealth as the bottom half put together. That's exactly the same proportion as the last time this analysis was compiled two years ago. But what about inequality? Well, handily enough, there is a way of measuring that, which is presented in this report. It's called the Gini coefficient (named after the Italian statistician Corrado Gini, by the way) and it examines the distribution of wealth. A score of zero means we all have exactly the same income; a score of one means one person having all the money, and the rest of us having nothing. This time around, Britain scored 0.62 overall. To put that in context, it was 0.61 a decade ago, when the ONS first did this report, but 0.63 last time round. In broad terms, inequality has not changed over the past decade. You might ask why things have not changed. The answer, as so often with economics, is that a lot of things have actually changed, but when you lump all those things together you end up with a net result that looks a lot like what came before. So on the minus side, we are becoming ever more divided by the value of property. Look at the two charts alongside this, and they tell a story. While homes in northeast England went down in value between July 2012 and June 2016, those in London went up by more than 30%. Nowhere else in the country comes anywhere near to touching that level of increase, which has led to Londoners becoming richer than any other place in Britain. The average household net property wealth in London is about £350,000. In the South East, it is about £100,000 less than that. In the North East, property wealth is slightly less than a third of the average in London. So we have a huge regional disparity, fuelled by the spiralling cost of London property in the aftermath of the credit crunch, and that fuels inequality between the capital, the South East, and then the rest of the country. It also stokes anger among young house buyers about the near impossibility of buying a property anywhere near the capital. But on the flip side, there is an area where inequality is falling. Auto-enrolment of pensions began in 2012, and has led to a huge spike in the number of people who are signed up to pension schemes. That is important because the two biggest factors in measuring our wealth are the amount of money we have tied up in a property, and the amount we have put away in a pension scheme. So, as property wealth has become more unequally distributed, pensions have spread further across society. More people saving more money. Inequality narrowed. One balances out the other, and the inequality stays the same. The tough question is whether Britain has done well to resist worsening inequality, or has failed in its quest to make society fairer. The answer, curiously, may well be yes. To both."
2018-02-01,The new Culture Secretary has prompted joy and mockery by launching a social media app named after himself.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180202063703/https://news.sky.com/story/culture-secretary-matt-hancock-mocked-for-launching-social-media-network-11232248,"Matt Hancock has opened a platform where users can apply for verification, watch live streams of him, add each other and send messages. In a video that appears upon opening it for the first time, Mr Hancock cheerily declares the app is to help him engage with his West Suffolk constituents and let them raise and discuss important issues. NEWS: Today I’ve launched the Matt Hancock app to connect with my West Suffolk constituents. Follow the link to download it & see what’s going on in the Matt app https://t.co/UBH3DtQQhR pic.twitter.com/6FOLjdtPqb Despite the app's serious intentions, the network has been inundated with memes and jokes poking fun at it. Fake accounts have also sprung up, with one post from ""Damo Green"", alluding to the Cabinet Office minister fired over false statements about watching porn on his parliamentary computer, reading: ""Hi Matt, where's the incognito mode?"" Another purporting to be from Lord Bates, the peer who tried to resign as a minister for missing a question in the House of Lords on Wednesday, says: ""Sorry all, am I late?"" Others compared it to satirical TV show The Thick Of It, which depicts a technophobe minister launching a government app with the slogan ""I call app Britain"". Look who turned up at over at #Hancock. pic.twitter.com/KuS49yq2p5 Labour MP Liam Byrne has tabled a question in the House of Commons about how the new internet age verification regulator will check if app users are old enough to view the pornography being uploaded on it. Serious technical issues have also been raised. Pat Walshe, a data protection and privacy consultant, said there was no privacy policy on the app's landing page - a breach of Apple's guidelines. He also claimed there were ""questions of fair and lawful processing"" of users' information, including photos on their phone. Silkie Carlo, director of civil liberties group Big Brother Watch, said: ""The Matt Hancock app is a fascinating comedy of errors. ""It is quite fitting, given this government's incompetence on digital privacy issues, that our digital minister's app steals a bank of users' personal photographs, even when permission to access them is denied."" Mr Hancock, who was promoted from digital minister to lead the department in last month's cabinet reshuffle, responded hours after the app's launch. He denied it breached security standards because it uses ""Apple technology"" and said it would be better than traditional social media platforms because it gave ""complete editorial control"", community moderation and user privacy. ""I'm delighted to have the chance to use this to build a safe, open and accessible online community for my West Suffolk constituents and I to engage with the issues that matter to them,"" Mr Hancock said. Despite the debate raging over the app, one user's post featured on the ""hottest"" content tab admits: ""I know we're all taking the p*** but… it's actually quite nice on here, isn't it?"""
2018-02-01,"A secret US military test to shoot down an incoming missile has failed, according to reports, raising concerns about the threat posed by North Korea.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180202063703/https://news.sky.com/story/secret-missile-defence-test-by-us-military-fails-11232092,"The SM-3 Block IIA interceptor missile was launched from Hawaii on Wednesday, but failed to intercept its target, according to an anonymous US official. The official said those involved in the launch, including developer Raytheon, were analysing why it failed. It is the second test confirmed to have failed since rising tensions between the US and North Korea prompted the regime's leader Kim Jong Un to threaten using a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile against the US mainland. Another SM-3 Block test in June failed after the interceptor missile's self-destruct mechanism was accidentally triggered by a member of military personnel, although there was a successful test in early 2017. The Missile Defense Agency confirmed that a test had taken place, but did not comment on its outcome. ""The Missile Defense Agency and US Navy sailors manning the Aegis Ashore Missile Defense Test Complex (AAMDTC) conducted a live-fire missile flight test using a Standard-Missile (SM)-3 Block IIA missile launched from the Pacific Missile Range Facility, Kauai, Hawaii, Wednesday morning,"" agency spokesman Mark Wright confirmed. US defence officials are said to be looking for sites on the country's west coast to deploy new anti-missile systems. The Missile Defence Agency is considering several locations to install a new Terminal High Altitude Air Defence (THAAD) interceptor system similar to the one which protects South Korea against a potential attack from the North, according to congressmen Mike Rogers and Adam Smith. It comes amid renewed fears over the nuclear ambitions of Mr Kim, who earlier this week ordered the test of a new long-range missile said to be capable of striking the entire US mainland. According to reports, a failed missile launch in North Korea hit one of its own cities during early January. President Donald Trump has praised the United Nations for voting unanimously for tough new sanctions to be imposed on North Korea. All 15 nations on the UN Security Council voted in December for further sanctions to be placed on the North after it tested a ballistic missile last month which Pyongyang claims could reach the US mainland. The sanctions include drastically lowering limits on North Korea's oil imports."
2018-02-01,The former boss of Formula One has criticised the decision by its new owners to scrap grid girls.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180202063703/https://news.sky.com/story/bernie-ecclestone-attacks-formula-one-grid-girl-ban-11232001,"Bernie Ecclestone says he cannot see why a ""good-looking"" woman standing next to a driver at the start of a race could be ""offensive"". The 87-year-old tycoon said it was a sign the UK was becoming ""prudish"". It came after Liberty Media, the sport's organiser, said the custom of using women on start lines was ""clearly... at odds with modern day societal norms"". The women are often seen carrying the drivers' standards which indicate their race numbers and their location on the starting line. They also often line the route that the top three drivers take as they head to the podium at the end of a race. :: 'I'm proud of being a grid girl - don't ban us' Ecclestone told Sky News: ""These girls did nothing harmful to anyone. ""We might as well say we do not want people going to fashion shows. They were smartly dressed. ""We have people saying it was going in darts, but that's a different type of sport, if you call it a sport. I thought people enjoyed seeing the girls and they are necessary really. This is actually a very key point. Worse than this would be if it suggests that victorious men can avail themselves of the girls on display, which is a subliminal message that has always been difficult to avoid. Big discussion. #F1 #gridgirls https://t.co/NfoEyMo8Pi ""When the team driver wants to get on the grid, it is much easier for them to know their place, where they are going to stop than hope they get it right and hope the teams were helping. ""It took a lot of time and stress from the teams."" He also said, assuming it did objectify women, he didn't ""remember any of the girls being forced to do it"". He went on to deny that grid girls would be wearing shorter skirts than they would do in any other situation. So the inevitable has happened, F1 gridgirls have been banned. Ridiculous that women who say they are ""fighting for women's rights"" are saying what others should and shouldn't do, stopping us from doing a job we love and are proud to do. PC gone mad 😡 #Gridgirls Ecclestone, who ran F1 for more than three decades, told The Sun earlier: ""The country at the moment is getting a bit prudish. ""You should be allowed to have grid girls because the drivers like them, the audience like them and no one cares. These girls were... part of the spectacle. ""I can't see how a good-looking girl standing with a driver and a number in front of a Formula One car can be offensive to anybody."" It is not the first time Mr Ecclestone, who became a billionaire as a result of his investment in the sport, has made statements about the participation of women in F1. No one is saying women shouldn't be allowed to do whatever they want career wise. Literally no one. It is the *concept* of grid girls and what it represents that is the issue. And if you truly don't understand why it is an issue then, quite frankly, yikes. In 2016, he told an advertising conference that female drivers would ""not be taken seriously"" in Formula One and they are ""not physically"" able to drive cars that fast. Several so-called grid girls have leaped to the defence of those who stand to lose their jobs as a result of the move. Lauren-Jade Pope, a ""grid girl and promo model"", tweeted: ""Because of these feminists, they've have cost us our jobs! I have been a grid girl for 8 years and I have Never felt uncomfortable! I love my job, if I didn't I wouldn't do it! Noone forces us to do this! This is our choice!"" I love my job. I’m respected, paid well & proud to represent the team I’m working for. It’s not right for anyone, let alone ‘feminists’ to judge our job when quite frankly they are putting so many women out of work. Where is the equality & empowerment here? #GridGirls #F1 💛🏁 pic.twitter.com/ookyjB1A8Q Rebecca Cooper, another grid girl, said on Twitter: ""If we don't do something to stop this where will it end? No grid girls, no cheerleaders, female singers being told what to wear on stage, no models in magazines?! I'll fight for my right to choose what I wear, where I work and to keep a job I love. I'll #fightformyrighttochoose"". The organisers of some of darts' biggest tournaments, the Professional Darts Corporation, also recently decided to stop using walk-on girls. A Sky News online poll asking people if they thought walk-on girls should be banned from all sports found 17% in favour and 83% against, after nearly 13,000 votes."
2018-02-01,Two sisters have been charged with murder after a three-year-old boy was allegedly beaten to death with a baseball bat for taking a cupcake.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180202063703/https://news.sky.com/story/sisters-killed-boy-three-for-taking-a-cupcake-11232045,"LaShirley Morris and Glenndria Morris were formally charged on Tuesday with two counts of murder, one of aggravated assault and two of first-degree cruelty in connection with the death of Kejuan Mason in Atlanta on 21 October last year. It is alleged that LaShirley Morris used a bat to repeatedly beat the young boy in the head, stomach, legs and arms while her sister, Kejuan's legal guardian, used her hand to spank him. According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Glenndria Morris told police that Kejuan had ""choked"" on the cupcake. She is said to have told officers that the cake was removed from his throat and that he was ""fine breathing and talking later"", but she then found him ""not breathing or responsive"" when he went to take a nap. She said she dialled 911 when she found the youngster, who was given CPR by a paramedic. Kejuan was pronounced dead at Atlanta Medical Centre, with medical examiners concluding that he had died from blunt force trauma. Glenndria Morris was arrested on the day of the incident, while her sister was arrested five days later. Both were granted a $200,000 (£140,000) bond on Monday as the Fulton County District Attorney still had not formally charged them. Georgia courts must grant a bond - which allows for a set amount of money to be paid to obtain release from police custody - if a suspect has not been charged within 90 days of an arrest. Officials have not said if the bond has been revoked following the indictment on Tuesday and the suspects remain at Fulton County Jail. They could face life behind bars if convicted."
2018-02-01,The FA says it has been made aware of reports concerning Sam Clucas' goal celebrations during Swansea's match against Arsenal.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180202063703/https://news.sky.com/story/fa-looks-into-sam-clucas-goal-celebrations-during-swanseas-match-against-arsenal-11232485,"It follows claims the midfielder was referencing a pornography website. Clucas scored twice as The Swans beat the Gunners 3-1 at the Liberty Stadium on Tuesday, and the 27-year-old marked both goals by apparently mimicking a pornography website's 'spy' symbol. Swansea insists Clucas was ""not fully aware"" of the website's content and say the club has reminded the midfielder of his ""responsibilities"". A Swansea spokesman said: ""As a club we were unaware of any links to the internet group in question and disappointed to learn of the association as it does not reflect the values of Swansea City nor our strong commitment to equality. ""We wholeheartedly condemn the degradation of women and believe everyone's rights, dignity and individual worth is to be respected. ""Having spoken to Sam, he was not fully aware of the pornographic sections of this internet group and at no time intended to cause offence which he apologises for. ""The club will speak to Sam again internally to establish the full facts, while also taking the opportunity to remind everyone of their responsibilities."""
2018-02-01,The most detailed simulation of the universe ever created has provided a breakthrough revealing how the most powerful and mysterious forces interact on an enormous scale.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180202063703/https://news.sky.com/story/simulation-of-universe-provides-black-hole-breakthrough-11231983,"Scientists said the detail and scale provided by the simulation enabled them to watch how galaxies formed, evolved and grew while also nursing the creation of new stars. Dr Shy Genel, at the New York-based Flatiron Institute's Centre for Computational Astrophysics (CCA), said: ""When we observe galaxies using a telescope, we can only measure certain quantities."" But ""with the simulation, we can track all the properties for all these galaxies. And not just how the galaxy looks now, but its entire formation history"", he added. He said the simulation is the most advanced ever developed. Using specialised computational methods, scientists have developed a computer model of the universe which has allowed them to write three ground-breaking papers which have been published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. An international team of scientists led by Volker Springel at the Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies developed and programmed the simulation of the universe, named ""Illustris: The Next Generation"" or IllustrisTNG for short. :: Supercomputer provides black hole breakthrough Dr Dylan Nelson of the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics used the simulation to reveal how star-forming galaxies shine brightly in the blue light of their young stars until an evolutionary shift suddenly halts the star formation, turning the galaxy into one dominated by old, rest stars. ""The only physical entity capable of extinguishing the star formation in our large elliptical galaxies are the supermassive black holes at their centres,"" explained Dr Nelson. ""The ultrafast outflows of these gravity traps reach velocities up to 10% of the speed of light and affect giant stellar systems that are billions of times larger than the comparably small black hole itself."" ""It is particularly fascinating that we can accurately predict the influence of supermassive black holes on the distribution of matter out to large scales,"" said Dr Springel. ""This is crucial for reliably interpreting forthcoming cosmological measurements."" IllustrisTNG is a model of a cube-shaped universe smaller than our own, just one billion light-years across (the observable universe has a diameter of about 93 billion light-years). The project followed the formation of millions of galaxies within this section of the universe, in the largest hydrodynamic simulation ever exploring how cosmic structures developed. It predicted a cosmic web of gas and dark matter which interacted to produce galaxies which were similar to real galaxies in shape and size. The researchers said that for the first time, the simulations have been able to directly compute the detailed clustering patterns of galaxies in space. In addition, the simulations predict how the cosmic web changes over time, especially in relation to the mysterious dark matter that is believed to make up 26.8% of the universe - compared to ordinary matter which makes up just 4.9% of the observable universe. The rest of the 68.3% of the observable universe is believed to be made of dark energy."
2018-02-01,"The NHS continues to face severe pressure this winter, with high levels of ambulance diverts, patient handover delays and bed occupancy, the latest figures from NHS England reveal.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180202063703/https://news.sky.com/story/nhs-winter-crisis-ambulance-diverts-at-their-highest-11231858,"Last week saw A&E departments send emergency patients elsewhere because they were too busy on 43 occasions, the highest number for a single week this winter. The figure was more than double the previous week and higher than the comparable week last year. Ambulance handover delays were also high, with 11,061 - around one in nine - waiting more than the target 30 minutes in the week to Sunday 28 January. Of these, 2,143 ambulances waited more than an hour to pass on their patient and get back on the road. And bed occupancy rose marginally, up to 95.1%, well ahead of both the recommended safe level of 85% and the predicted level of 92%. All these measures indicate the health service remains under acute stress despite extensive planning for winter and some additional funding provided by the Government. NHS England said 40% of the ambulance diverts were accounted for by two trusts, Durham & Darlington, which sent patients elsewhere because of an equipment breakdown, and Worcester. The number of beds closed because of norovirus fell week-on-week. NHS England said the significant flu outbreak was responsible for some increased demand. A spokesperson said: ""Raised levels of flu and norovirus cases continued to put pressure on busy hospitals and other frontline services last week. ""And while the NHS is generally coping with ongoing winter demands, the public can continue to play their part by using NHS 111 and pharmacists for advice."" Nick Scriven, president of the Society of Acute Medicine, said hospitals remain under severe pressure. He said: ""The massive rise in admissions since Christmas is now being felt as pressure beyond emergency departments, with rising delayed discharges and longer stays. ""Many hospitals are still running at around 95% bed occupancy despite additional capacity being opened. ""Doctors in acute medicine are often the ones charged with looking after additional patients and have been under even greater strain since NHS had go ahead to return to 'usual business', which is a concern."""
2018-02-01,"EU citizens arriving in Britain after Brexit must have different rights to those here before the cut off date, Downing Street has announced.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180202063703/https://news.sky.com/story/pm-vows-to-push-for-different-statuses-for-eu-nationals-after-brexit-day-11232089,"Under the UK's plans, anyone who arrives in the country before it leaves the EU will be allowed to apply for permanent ""settled status"". They must have lived or go on to live in the UK for five years to receive it. But Theresa May wants to change the rights of those who arrive after the official divorce date - expected to be 29 March 2019 - so they would be subject to the new post-Brexit immigration scheme. That would likely mean visas, registration on arrival and an ability to add caps on benefits to EU migrants. Brussels insists otherwise - saying freedom of movement should continue until the transition ends when Britain formally quits the customs union. Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit co-ordinator, said the UK had to remain subject to EU legislation and case law for the transition to work. He wrote on Twitter: ""Citizens' rights during the transition are not negotiable. ""We will not accept that there are two sets of rights for EU citizens. For the transition to work, it must mean a continuation of the existing acquis with no exceptions."" The fight promises to build over the next two months, as both sides hope to reach a deal by the EU Council summit at the end of March. Brexit Secretary David Davis said on Thursday he was ""fairly confident"" the deadline would be met. It comes after Theresa May tried to assuage the fears of her Brexiteer MPs by rejecting some of the demands from the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier. Speaking on a trade trip to China, where she was told she had become affectionately known as ""Auntie May"", the PM said: ""I'm clear there's a difference between those people who came prior to us leaving and those who will come when they know the UK is no longer a member of the EU. ""When we agreed the citizens' rights deal in December, we did so on the basis that people who had come to the UK when we were a member of the EU had set up certain expectations. ""They made a life choice and set up certain expectations and it was right that we have made an agreement that ensured they could continue their life in the way they had wanted to. ""Now for those who come after March 2019, that will be different - because they will be coming to a UK that they know will be outside the EU"". Meanwhile, a Scottish minister has promised to publish a UK paper on the impact of Brexit if he is given a copy. Mike Russell said the document, a draft of which was leaked earlier this week, ""needs to be published"". He has written to Mr Davis and urged him to share the analysis with the Scottish government."

Morrisons said that while it was cutting managerial positions, it was planning to hire 1,700 customer assistants - lower paid jobs. It said that the 1,500 staff affected by the decision would not all necessarily lose their work as the chain currently had 800 managerial vacancies they could apply for. Gary Mills, Morrisons retail director, said: ""Our aim is to serve customers better with more frontline colleagues in stores improving product availability and helping customers at the checkouts. ""Very regrettably, there will be a period of uncertainty for some managers affected by these proposals and we'll be supporting them through this important process. ""Our commitment is to redeploy as many affected colleagues as possible."" Morrisons - like its so-called 'big four' rivals - has not been immune from the challenge posed to their dominance by discounters such as Aldi and Lidl which have been growing their market shares rapidly since the financial crisis. Supermarket margins have been placed under pressure by the competition - exacerbated since 2017 by the Brexit-linked fall in the value of the pound which forced up import costs - costs which have been partly passed on to shoppers. Morrisons has been among the strongest performers, in terms of its recovery under chief executive David Potts who reported stronger Christmas sales after a previously poor festive season, in 2014, saw his predecessor lose his job. Joanne McGuinness, from the USDAW shopworkers' union, said: ""This is a further big upheaval for the Morrisons store management team after the restructure in 2014/15. ""We will be entering into consultations with the company on behalf of our members affected by these changes, which the company proposes to implement in April."" She added: ""Our priorities are to avoid redundancies and help our members stay employed within the business. ""We have secured from Morrisons a commitment to offer redeployment opportunities for all affected managers."""

Jackson denies a further charge of sexual assault. The woman, who cannot be identified, was giving evidence at the second day of the trial of Jackson, 26, and Olding, 24, at Belfast Crown Court. The court heard that she had told a friend via text message: ""No, I do not want to get the police involved. ""You know how that will turn out. It's my word against theirs. ""Ulster Rugby will vouch for their good character and I'll just look like a stupid little girl."" The court heard that the woman had also told friends there was ""no point"" in going to the police. ""No, I do not want anyone to hear,"" she had written to a friend. ""I would just be embarrassed."" Jackson's defence barrister Brendan Kelly QC asked her why she had not told friends that another woman had walked into the bedroom while she was allegedly being attacked. She replied: ""Because the whole rape had been so traumatic that was what I had focused on. ""The fact that someone had walked in was secondary."" She added: ""Whenever the girl walked into the room, the stage that she walked in at, she had already missed the moment that those men crossed the line. ""She had not witnessed the blatant disregard for the fact that I did not want to have sex."" The case, being heard by a jury of nine men and three women, is expected to last for five weeks."

Following its inquiry, the bookmakers have ""formally committed to change the way they offer bonus promotions to ensure players can always access and release their own money"". Under the changes, players will no longer need to play multiple times before they can withdraw their own money - and any restrictions must be made clear to customers in advance. Bonus promotions are commonly offered by casino-like gambling websites, offering extra funds when players deposit their own cash. The CMA has now released guidance so firms understand their obligations and gamblers know their rights - with the watchdog stressing that the bookmakers' undertakings were not an admission of a breach of the law. Its investigation heard evidence online platforms were trapping gamblers' cash through opaque terms and conditions that often meant they had to agree multiple stakes before they could unlock their winnings. One website offered to match a customer's opening deposit with a welcome bonus - but the punter was required to wager 50 times their deposit before they were able to withdraw any winnings or the cash they had placed in their account. The findings were issued at a sensitive time for bookmakers - with the sector's high street operators facing curbs on the use of fixed-odds betting terminals - dubbed the ""crack cocaine of gambling"" by their critics. The CMA warned on Thursday that the Gambling Commission could enforce penalties on firms across the industry - which is worth £4.7bn annually - should they fall foul of the new rules. The CMA's project director, George Lusty, said: ""Gambling always carries a risk, but players should never face unfair restrictions that prevent them from getting at their money. ""Firms mustn't stack the odds against players, by putting unfair obstacles in their way, or making it difficult for them to stop gambling when they want to. ""The CMA is here to make sure businesses' terms and practices are fair for their customers. ""We welcome the commitment from these leading firms to address the problems our investigation uncovered, by making important changes to their terms and conditions. ""We now expect others to follow, and look forward to the Gambling Commission's continued work to make sure all operators in this sector play fair with their customers' money."" Ladbrokes and William Hill responded by welcoming clarity on the issue from the regulator. Brian Chappell, founder of campaign group Justice4Punters, responded: ""It's nearly 30 months to the day since Justice for Punters sent evidence of the use of unfair terms and conditions to the CMA and Gambling Commission. ""Since that day millions have been lost and many people have been conned by the T&Cs in these promotions, but hopefully this will now stop."""
2018-02-01,"The second president of the United States John Adams once said: ""In politics, the middle way is no way at all"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180202063703/https://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-may-lose-lifeline-with-middle-way-brexit-11226406,"Mr Adams knew a thing or two about revolutions and knew that, in their midst, you have to pick a side. With Brexit, we've had our own revolt and it is the middle way which is leading Theresa May inexorably to the most perilous moment of her premiership. I was initially sceptical that such a threat existed. I still think the most likely outcome is that Mrs May survives and limps on. But, having talked to several Conservative MPs on both wings of the party today, I believe that there is an increasing possibility she will face a challenge. Part of the reason for that are Mrs May's own missteps. She has never - could never recover her authority after the catastrophe of the general election result. Her botched and limited reshuffle adverted to (rather than distracted from) her systemic weakness and resulted in her spending the limited capital she had accrued from December's successful EU negotiations. Worse, when Brexit is not discussed (as was largely the case in the first half of this week), Tory MPs become restless and darkly whisper that the PM has little in the way of domestic agenda and even less in the way of dynamism. They worry she is shrinking, not growing, into the job. One MP told me: ""Both I and the vast majority of Conservative MPs and ministers think she is hopeless."" But her biggest danger comes not from something she has done but instead because of something she has yet to do. With little more than a year to go until B-day and negotiations on the transition and final settlement looming, Mrs May must finally make a series of choices, many of which she has put off for so long. She must decide what sort of customs arrangement she wants. She must decide how closely Britain will remain aligned to the EU's regulatory regime. She must decide how long she wants the transition to be. A wrong step in any of these, much less all three, could provoke mutiny. But several Remainer MPs have told me that they are certain no new no-confidence letters have been signed by anyone on their side. That's not to say Remainer MPs are content with her. They're despairing. But they cling onto her for fear of getting something worse. One MP told me: ""It would be deeply irresponsible to have a three-month leadership contest at such a critical point in the Brexit negotiations- we run the risk of getting some ghastly Brexiteer like Jacob Rees-Mogg."" Given just how Eurosceptic the remaining Tory grassroots are, that isn't an unreasonable assumption. Naturally, the Brexiteers have no such fear. Rather, they're worried that Mrs May is reneging on the Brexit she promised them. For example, Theresa Villiers in the Sunday Telegraph warns that Britain risks staying in the EU ""in all but name"". These developments are crucial. Hitherto the arch-Brexiteers have been May's lifeline. In the wake of the election shambles they made the assessment that, however damaged as she might have been, she remained ""the best vehicle for delivering Brexit"", as one senior former Brexiteer cabinet minister told me a few weeks ago. If, through the detail of the negotiations, Mrs May appears likely to deliver a softer Brexit than they would like, that calculus would change and they would strike. Brexiteers have waited a long time to reach the promised land. If they fear the road there is running out they will not hesitate to try and remove a Prime Minister they don't much care for anyway. As one MP told me, the leadership plots are being orchestrated by ""hard Brexiteers who see their mad Brexit vision slipping away"". Mrs May was chosen to be Tory leader because she was offensive to neither side of the Brexit schism. Accordingly she is now about to try and chart a middle course. But as John Adams could have told her: ""This would be the best of all possible worlds, if there were no religion in it"". Brexit is not normal politics. It is almost religious. It is a matter of emotion, faith and belief (on both sides). The problem with religions is that their adherents are prone to visions, something the Prime Minister most certainly is not. Her middle way might seem sensible to outsiders but to Brexit's strongest adherents it will be heretical. And if the rumours are right, it doesn't need many more true believers to trigger the removal of this Pope. Worse for the Conservatives, there is a possible scenario which would leave them all worse off. Everyone talks as if a vote of no confidence would be the end of Mrs May. As John Adams never said: ""It ain't necessarily so"". Forty-eight MPs are needed to trigger a contest but Mrs May does not have to resign. She could fight on. If Remainers and the few loyalists she has band together, she might survive. She would stagger on, but weaker than before. So would everyone else. It would be Jeremy Corbyn who would emerge all the stronger and, as we know, he has a few revolutionary ideas of his own."
2018-02-01,Jim Carrey has been cleared of any role in the suicide of his ex-girlfriend after his lawyer proved she forged medical records in an attempt to prove he had given her three sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180202063703/https://news.sky.com/story/jim-carrey-cleared-of-role-in-suicide-of-ex-girlfriend-cathriona-white-11232171,"The 56-year-old star was sued by the mother and estranged husband of Cathriona White following her death in 2015, with the Irish-born make-up artist having taken an overdose of prescription pills. Notes found at her home revealed she was upset at the breakdown of her on-off relationship with Carrey, which had begun in 2013. Brigid Sweetman and Mark Burton both accused Carrey of providing the drugs to the 30-year-old, and said he had obtained them illegally under a false name. Carrey denied the claims and filed a countersuit against the pair in September, insisting the lawsuits were an attempt to exploit him. The actor also said that Ms White had blackmailed him by threatening to go public with what he said were false claims that he had given her STDs unless he paid her millions of dollars. He had previously paid her an undisclosed sum to settle the accusations. In a statement issued when he filed the countersuit, Carrey described the ""depth of deception"" behind the lawsuits as ""unimaginable"". Now his attorney, Raymond Boucher, has found that Ms White edited information on a friend's old STD test to make it look like it belonged to her - and then intended to use it to accuse the actor. Through his investigation, Mr Boucher discovered that the forged results sheet was from a 2011 test, and that Ms White had tried to use it to prove she was clean before entering into a relationship with Carrey. Ms Sweetman and Mr Burton had said contracting the STDs from Carrey had caused Ms White mental distress, which could have contributed to her taking her own life. The case against the Canadian-born comedian has now been dismissed, his representative said, who added that he was ""looking forward to moving on with his life"". Michael Avenatti, the attorney for Ms Sweetman and Mr Burton, has offered no comment. :: Anyone feeling emotionally distressed or suicidal can call Samaritans for help on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org in the UK."

Then we are going to negotiate a free-trade agreement with the EU. ""It'll be a separate agreement we can negotiate,"" the PM added. ""That means we can get on with the job of enhancing trade round the world - important for prosperity and jobs."" Her comments will be seen as an attempt to assuage fears of those Tory MPs who fear a 'soft' Brexit and as a rebuke to colleagues such as Chancellor Philip Hammond, who last week suggested the UK-EU economic relationship would change only ""very modestly"". :: Sky Views: Time running out for timorous May Speaking during her trade trip to China, Mrs May dismissed a report which suggested the UK economy would be hit whatever exit deal is negotiated with the EU. ""The analysis has not been completed and it is not like the agreement we want to negotiate. We want to trade with as little friction and tariffs as possible,"" she said. ""What matters for people is: Are we going to leave the EU? Yes. ""Are we taking back control of our money, borders and our laws? Yes. ""Are we going to ensure we are going to do trade deals around the world? Yes. Are we going to ensure there will be more jobs for people in the UK? Yes. Mrs May insisted that work to secure more business for Britain outside the EU was already well under way. ""While we look ahead, we are ensuring businesses today can sign new agreements for selling great British products into the Chinese market. ""We're seeing more Chinese investment coming into the UK. Why does it matter? It is about jobs for people in the UK."""

In week four, the agency said there were 52.1 GP consultations per 100,000 in England, compared to 54.1 per 100,00 in week three. Across the UK there were 177 admissions to ICU/HDU with ""confirmed influenza"". :: UK flu outbreak 'worst in seven years' Overall, PHE said there had been a 7% fall in the rate of hospitalisation because of flu, and a 26% reduction in admissions to intensive care. The main strains in circulation continue to be A(H3N2), A(H1N1) and Flu B. It added that in the last few weeks, ""statistically significant excess mortality"" was continuing in over-65s in England.

2018-02-01,The plastic insulation that burned on the outside of Grenfell Tower had been issued with a fire performance report by the government’s fire safety advisor BRE which contained errors.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180202063703/https://news.sky.com/story/safety-report-on-grenfell-insulation-had-errors-11232492,"Plastic insulation manufacturer Celotex says it discovered ""differences"" between the fire test of its RS5000 foam panels at BRE's laboratory in 2014 and the crucial write-up of the test, known as a BR135 report, issued by BRE fire engineers. The company said it did not know whether the differences meant other buildings using their product are safe. ""We have identified that one or more additional materials seem to have been used in the rainscreen cladding system which was tested that do not appear in the test report,"" the company said. ""Our priority is to establish whether there are any fire safety issues arising from these differences."" Architects and building designers rely on an official product certificate based in part on the BR135 report to tell them how a combustible cladding system should be built to make it safe in the event of a fire. Following Celotex's announcement of the discrepancies, BRE issued a brief statement denying responsibility for the error. It said: ""The information provided by Celotex for inclusion in the report is a question for Celotex - it was their discrepancy not BRE's."" In a subsequent statement it went further, saying: ""It is our understanding that the test system was not constructed according to Celotex's design specification and as such, the test results have been withdrawn."" :: Grenfell - Britain's fire safety crisis Celotex launched the RS5000 polyisocyanurate product immediately after the test as the first plastic foam insulation permitted for use on the outside of tower blocks. The test report stated that the combustible plastic insulation must be covered with cement fibre cladding panels on the outside. Celotex RS5000 insulation was later fixed to the outside of Grenfell Tower with combustible plastic-filled cladding and has been blamed for helping to spread the fire that killed 71 people in June last year. BRE describes its BR135 reports as a ""classification of fire performance"" and each one states: ""the system specification and installation details have been provided by the client."" Local Government Association Chairman Lord Porter described the revelations as shocking. ""They add further doubt that the testing process surrounding the BS8414 test can be relied upon as proof of product safety,"" he said. ""It is hugely concerning that such level of doubt has now been cast over the test, not only by different parts of the industry but also by BRE themselves. ""Building owners who are removing flammable cladding urgently need clear advice from the Government about what they can and cannot safely put on high-rise blocks as a replacement."" Celotex, which suspended supply of RS5000 insulation in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire described the error as ""a matter of real regret"". It went on: ""We fully recognise its potential seriousness and that it will give rise to concern. We are working hard to arrange the further testing as quickly as possible and we will make a further announcement once the results of that testing are available."""
2018-02-01,"Dominic Chappell, the former owner of BHS, has been slapped with a £10m bill by pensions watchdogs as they try to recover money owed to the bankrupt retailer's retirement scheme.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180202063703/https://news.sky.com/story/pensions-watchdog-hits-ex-bhs-owner-chappell-with-10m-bill-11232086,"Sky News understands that The Pensions Regulator (TPR) served a determination notice on Chappell last month to notify him that it is seeking the sum. Under its rules, the three-times bankrupt was given 28 days - a period which is understood to expire within the next fortnight - to refer the order to the Upper Tribunal for the judgment to be reviewed. If he does not refer the order, enforcement of the £10m demand would be pursued in the form of a contribution notice. A TPR spokesman said: ""Our separate anti-avoidance action against Dominic Chappell continues and TPR's Determinations Panel has made its determination. ""We will publish the outcome as soon as it is appropriate to do so."" TPR's demand adds to Chappell's troubles over the department store chain he bought for £1 from Sir Philip Green in 2015. Chappell is due to be sentenced later this month after being found guilty in January for failing to provide the watchdog with information relating to BHS. One source said on Thursday that the responsibility for pursuing Chappell for the £10m payment would lie with the trustees or the Pension Protection Fund, the pensions lifeboat which now administers payments to BHS pensioners. It is unclear whether Chappell has the means to pay the money, or whether any failure to do so could lead to him being declared bankrupt for at least the fourth time. The latest demand from TPR comes nearly a year after Sir Philip agreed to pay up to £363m towards BHS's retirement fund. The retailer's collapse in April 2016 cost roughly 11,000 jobs and sparked a furious political row over the behaviour of large private company-owners. Sky News revealed last weekend that a report by BHS's liquidators disclosing that a 3.6p interim dividend - worth a total of roughly £36m - had been paid out. Most of the interim dividend revealed in the FRP report has been funded by an agreement reached last summer in which Sir Philip's Arcadia Group agreed to release its claim over a £35m floating charge linked to BHS. The ‎progress report disclosed that investigations into the circumstances surrounding BHS's failure are continuing, but provides few further details because of their ""sensitive and largely privileged nature"". It added that work to examine the disposal of properties ""that appear to have advantaged certain parties potentially at the expense of the company""‎ was under way but was at an early stage. FRP also said it would probe the ""appropriateness of fees paid by the company in respect of advice received from professional advisers"" - thought to include law firm‎s which have already faced heavy criticism from MPs when they investigated BHS's collapse. Other inquiries into the department store chain‎'s demise, led by the Insolvency Service and the Financial Reporting Council, remain ongoing. The 3.63p interim dividend compares to an original estimate by BHS's administrators of a total recovery of up to 8p in the pound, suggesting that the eventual sum recouped from the chain's wreckage could exceed that projection. However, that figure will still be modest ‎in the context of the £998m of claims received from unsecured creditors - the largest chunk of which relates to BHS's pension scheme. Chappell could not be reached for comment."

His terror attack on 19 June last year killed Makram Ali, who was being helped after collapsing on the pavement, and left others with life-changing injuries. Osborne's trial heard he had originally hoped to use the rented van to kill Jeremy Corbyn and ""as many people as possible"" at an Islamic march the day before. But when he realised he could not get near the central London event he drove for hours looking for an alternative. Osborne asked for directions to the nearest mosque and then travelled to Finsbury Park in the north of the city. The court was shown CCTV of the killer doing laps of the area, with cameras capturing the moment he drove through a crowd of people in Islamic dress shortly after midnight. Jurors also listened to a 999 call made after Mr Ali, 51, had collapsed. The moment the van hits the crowd can be heard, followed by minutes of chaos, with the caller asking for more ambulances. Witnesses said Osborne - a father of four - was smiling and blowing kisses after the attack. “I've done my job,"" he said to people as they held him and waited for police. ""You can kill me now,” he was said to have added. The jury heard Osborne's motives were clear from a handwritten note found in the van. It complained about terrorists on UK streets and the Rotherham child grooming scandal. The note referred to Muslims as ""feral"" and described Muslim men as ""rapists"", declaring they were: ""Hunting in packs preying on our children, this will be coming to a town near you soon, it most probably has, get back to the desert, you raping inbred bastards & climb back on ya camels."" Osborne also called Mr Corbyn a ""terrorist sympathiser"" and lambasted London mayor Sadiq Khan and pop star Lily Allen, prosecutors told the jury. It is believed he wrote the letter in a pub the day before he drove to London in a hired van. CCTV footage of the Holybush pub, near Cardiff, showed Osborne writing a note and drinkers said he was ranting about Muslims before he was asked to leave. Witnesses told how Osborne declared: ""I'm going to kill all the Muslims, Muslims are all terrorists. ""Your families are all going to be Muslim. I'm going to take it into my own hands."" His girlfriend, Sarah Andrews, told Woolwich Crown Court that Osborne had become ""obsessed"" with Muslims, having watched BBC drama Three Girls about the Rochdale grooming scandal. The programme aired in May, not long after the Westminster terror attack in March. As Osborne became more extreme in his views, the UK was struck by two more attacks: Manchester in May, and London Bridge in June. In her witness statement, Ms Andrews said her boyfriend was a ""ticking time bomb"", adding: ""He seemed brainwashed and totally obsessed."" Osborne showed no remorse during the trial and said he had planned the attack with ""a guy called Dave"" and another man called ""Terry Jones"". Claiming ""Dave"" was driving the van, he said he was in the footwell and had no idea what was happening. Defence lawyers dismissed the ""absurd"" late defence, and with no evidence to back up his claims - including no CCTV of ""Dave"", jurors took under an hour to find Osborne guilty."

It was 2.30pm on 3rd February 2017 when the 87-year-old answered her door on Castleton Avenue and a man forced his way in. He beat the grandmother relentlessly, demanded cash and ripped the wedding ring from her finger. Eileen's injuries were horrific, but somehow she managed to escape and alert neighbours. After nearly two months in hospital she returned home but died a day later. Her son David Blane described the family's torment: ""He took £30 and my mum's wedding ring. My mum's wedding ring was on her finger 63 years. And that was one of the most heart-rending things that could have happened to my mum - and that alone could have killed her."" As the family copes with the first anniversary of this attack, police have released new CCTV footage of a man seen shopping in the Co-Op on Barton Road at 2.30pm where Eileen had been seen earlier that day. Police wish to speak to him along with a second man revealed in an e-fit image who was seen on Chatsworth Road, just five minutes from Eileen's home. Along with these images police have shared a recording of Eileen describing the attack to officers. The grandmother can be heard saying ""He started chucking me about, and I couldn't get up...He just wouldn't stop hitting me - that was the main thing."" The 87 yr old described it as a nightmare and said: ""He said I weren't going to get out, you see, he was going to make sure we didn't."" A £50,000 reward still stands for anyone with information that could lead to a successful conviction. Detective Inspector John Mulvihill from Greater Manchester Police says ""I implore anyone who recognises these men to get in touch or if you believe this is you please contact us immediately. ""Even the smallest piece of information could be crucial in helping us find the person responsible for Eileen's murder."" Eileen's son John recalls speaking to his mother in hospital: ""She had two main concerns - has he been caught yet? ""She was concerned he's going to do this to somebody else. Her second concern was he's going to kill someone, and unfortunately he did, our mum."""

His parents, Tom Evans and Kate James, want him to have continued treatment, but doctors argue it would be ""futile"". In the High Court in Liverpool today, the hearing had to be adjourned for 20 minutes for Mr Evans' parents and sisters to comfort him, as he wept while he heard evidence that life support should be turned off. The parents of the 20-month-old believe he responds to them, but medics have said he is suffering spontaneous seizures as a result of being touched. Michael Mylonas QC, representing the hospital, said: ""One of the problems of this case is they look at him and, barring the paraphernalia of breathing and feeding, he's a sweet, lovely, normal-looking boy who opens his eyes, will smile..."" Mr Evans, 20, broke down when he heard this evidence, and a break was called in proceedings. Mr Mylonas later continued by saying Alfie had suffered ""catastrophic degradation of his brain tissue"" and could only breathe with intervention. He regularly has fits, triggered by touching. At the request of Mr Evans and Ms James, three medical experts from the Vatican-linked Bambino Gesu Pediatric Hospital in Rome had visited but they had reached the same conclusions of ""complete futility"" of treating the baby. Mr Justice Anthony Hayden, hearing the case, said he'd had the ""privilege"" of meeting Alfie, and added no one could blame the parents for trying to leave no stone unturned. Medical experts are unable to say how aware of his surroundings Alfie is, and say if he can feel a soothing hand he may also feel a the ""pin prick"" during his treatment. Italian experts suggested operations including a tracheotomy and a gastronomy to help him breathe and feed for an undefined period of time. But an expert in the ventilation of children, believed such operations were ""inappropriate"". He said: ""I think we are all agreed from the medical perspective that life expectancy is limited. ""Because of that, I would feel it would be more appropriate to allow nature to take its course. ""That view is also supported by the fact that I don't think anyone can be certain exactly what Alfie is feeling and whether or not he maybe feeling pain or discomfort. ""I think the provision of continuing intensive care to sustain life when they may be suffering is not one that, as medical professionals, most would consider appropriate."" The hearing will continue on Friday."

""I mean, we know now that he was the last person to be with Natalie before she disappeared."" The West Side Story and Rebel Without A Cause star, who was 43, had been drinking heavily on a yacht with Wagner and fellow actor Christopher Walken on the night she died. Hart to Hart star Wagner alerted authorities at 1.30am and a search was launched. It was initially thought she might have returned to shore using the boat's dinghy. Her body was found floating face-down in the ocean some 200 metres from shore. The dinghy was found nearby, about a mile from the main boat. There was bruising found on Wood's face, but the initial coroner's report decided the death was accidental and the bruising probably occurred when she ended up in the water. In 2011, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department reopened the investigation. A coroner's report in 2013 concluded her death should be left as ""undetermined"". ""The location of the bruises, the multiplicity of the bruises, lack of head trauma, or facial bruising support bruising having occurred prior to entry in the water,"" it said. Wagner, now 87, who has starred in the Austin Powers movies, wrote in a 2008 memoir that he and Walken had argued that night. He wrote that Walken went to bed and he stayed up for a while, but when he went to bed, he noticed his wife and a dinghy that had been attached to the yacht were missing. ""Nobody knows,"" he wrote. ""There are only two possibilities; either she was trying to get away from the argument, or she was trying to tie the dinghy. But the bottom line is that nobody knows exactly what happened."" Officer Corina said of Wagner: ""I haven't seen him tell the details that match all the other witnesses in this case. I think he's constantly changed his story a little bit. And his version of events just don't add up."" ""I think it's suspicious enough to make us think that something happened,"" he said. As a 16-year-old, Wood's part in Rebel Without A Cause alongside James Dean in 1955 earned her a nomination for the best supporting actress Oscar. She starred in the musicals West Side Story and Gypsy, and received best actress nominations for her performances in Splendor In The Grass and Love With The Proper Stranger."
2018-02-01,"Far-right extremists like Finsbury mosque attacker Darren Osborne justify their behaviour by blaming Muslims, 7/7 terror detective David Videcette writes.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180202063703/https://news.sky.com/story/far-right-extremists-justify-attacks-by-blaming-muslims-says-77-detective-11232477,"How many times have you heard, ""It’s the West’s foreign policy toward the Middle East that causes Islamic terrorism"" or ""It’s Israel's policy toward the Palestinians that is the cause of Palestinian terrorism""? As a former counter-terror detective with Scotland Yard, I’ve heard it many times. Indeed it is often cited by suspects under arrest for Islamist terror offences during their interviews, or as a justification for their behaviour. So, I wasn’t surprised to hear Darren Osborne saying in court during his terrorism trial for the attempted murder of pedestrians outside Finsbury Park mosque, that he’d justified his violent thoughts to himself using a mirrored form of logic based on his own framework of beliefs. He claimed that the Al Quds March - where people waved Hezbollah flags on London’s streets, so soon after three Islamists terror attacks in the UK during 2017 - was a primary motivator for him to carry out his own terror attack. However, when it came to the actual admission of the act he was charged with, he at various points claimed that he was in the footwell of the van and that someone called Dave was driving. We have a growing problem with far-right extremism in the UK. Almost a third of those people referred to the government's Prevent strategy, the programme aimed at combating violent extremism with mentoring before violence takes place, were far right extremists. While arrests for far-right extremism are in the minority of terror arrests (8%), the actual scale of the problem is likely masked by arrests for other minor public order offences that are not recorded centrally by government. The warning signs have been there for some time. While the motive for the murder of Jo Cox in 2016 was not legally proven in court as terrorism, many, including myself, felt that it was politically motivated and should be classed as a terror attack. Osborne’s attack at Finsbury Park mosque was carried out just a few days after the first anniversary of Cox’s murder. The evidence is quite stark. You need only look at any social media platform and see the polarisation of the views there. The Islamists blaming the West’s Foreign Policy and the far-right, and far-right extremists blaming Muslims and anyone on the left that opposes their view. In fact we now have cottage industries for commentators who try to out-do each other with their hateful views of their opposition, with the moderate and balanced voices of sensible people lost in the melee. Two weeks after the 7/7 bombings in 2005, which claimed the lives of 52 people and four suicide bombers, another four Islamist extremists attempted to repeat the attack. On 21/7, they failed simply because of an error in the mixture of the home-made explosives. One of the men who tried to blow himself up, claimed that it was a prank gone wrong; a publicity stunt. Like Darren Osborne, he wasn’t man enough to admit his intention to murder others. Happy to talk hypothetically, but in the cold light of day, when looked in the eye and asked to justify what he’d done, he cowered behind lies and half-truths, just like Osborne. Psychologically, I see this perpetrator of 21/7 as almost indistinguishable from Osborne. Indeed, new research from Uppsala University in Sweden shows that the same psychological mechanism explains violence among both Muslim and Western extremists. Though they come from different religions and are opposed to one another, telling them apart is difficult. These men are both racist ideologues and products of an increasingly divided society, where the charismatic shape their political views using religion, hate and opportunism. :: David Videcette is a former counter-terror detective with Scotland Yard and an expert on the 7/7 and 21/7 London bombings.

However, the Cambodian authorities allegedly told them they would still not be given their passports and would be obliged to attend a court hearing at a later date. Members of the group have told relatives that some - although not all - have been informed that, as an alternative, if they confess to the alleged crime they would spend six weeks in jail and then be released upon payment of a fine. One source close to the families of those arrested told Sky News: ""It's extortion, plain and simple. Forty thousand dollars is a lot of money to find. ""There's been no mention to us that it's a bail arrangement... As far as we're concerned, we're being asked for a one-off cash payment to set them free. ""Even if we paid it, who's to say that there wouldn't be another demand for another $40,000 down the line? ""The families are worried sick. These people did nothing wrong, no credible evidence has been presented against them... and now this demand for cash? It's corruption and it's a disgrace. ""While they're being held, they are also being charged $90 for food and $80 for use of electricity."" Five Britons are among the group of 10 arrested in the Cambodian resort of Siem Reap for ""singing and dancing pornographically"". Vincent Harley Robert Hook, 35, Daniel Richard Leeming Jones, 30, Thomas Alexander Jeffries, 22, Billy Stevens, 21, and Paul Francis Harris, 32, were arrested along with three other men and two women during a party in the northwestern resort town last Thursday. The other members of the group are: Job Robertus van der Wel, 22, from The Netherlands; Canadians Jessica Drolet, 25, of Ottawa, and Eden Koazoleas, 19, of Alberta; David Nikolaus Aleksandr Ballovarre, 22, of Oslo, Norway; and 32-year-old New Zealander Paul Martin Brasch. All have been told they could be jailed for between a month and a year if convicted of a charge ""producing pornographic pictures"". Local police have produced photographs showing clothed and laughing tourists, some in sexually suggestive positions. However, the group insists that none of the people in the images are among those arrested. Sky News has attempted to contact Cambodian authorities for comment."
2018-02-02,"A British air accident investigator has told Sky News he believes there were explosions on board a plane before it crashed eight years ago, killing Polish President Lech Kaczynski.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180203065615/https://news.sky.com/story/smolensk-crash-explosions-on-board-before-plane-hit-ground-investigator-says-11233792,"Frank Taylor's findings challenge the original reports of the Russian and Polish authorities which blamed pilot error for the crash in Smolensk, Russia, in April 2010 which killed 96 people. In his first television interview, Frank Taylor said: ""I think they did not do a thorough investigation. It seems to me they came to that conclusion early on and sought evidence to justify it."" Russian investigators concluded that in dreadful weather conditions the pilot flew too low, hit a birch tree, searing the wing off. Frank Taylor was involved in the Lockerbie and Manchester air crash investigations. He's examined high resolution photographs of the crash site. He said: ""If the tip (of the wing) had been cut off by a birch tree the damage wouldn't have looked like this. It would have been bent back - consistently backwards, rather than up and maybe even forward. ""As far as I can see there was an explosion in the wing before the aircraft reached the birch tree. ""Possibly some of the bits hit the birch tree afterwards but the evidence is that this explosion caused the wing tip to come off. Then the aircraft rolled but at a higher altitude than the Russian report suggests. ""What I can say is there is no doubt there were explosions on board before the aircraft hit the ground."" Frank Taylor also says he believes damage to the left side cabin door is consistent with what he calls massive internal pressure. Relatives have long complained that Russia failed to protect the crash site. Russia has refused to return any wreckage or the full flight data recordings. Political activist Anna Walentynowicz was on the plane. In Poland her son says he was threatened with jail for speaking out after the wrong body was returned to him and that no relative can be sure they have actually buried their loved ones. Those on board were on their way to the 70th commemoration of the Katyn massacre of Polish intellectuals, politicians and military officers by the Soviets in the Second World War. A member of the Federation of Katyn Families spoke to us on behalf of the Smolensk relatives but wanted to remain anonymous for security reasons. He said: ""Some relatives have reported being threatened and abused by hooligans. I think it would be fair to describe it as they lived in a climate of fear. ""This is now no longer a Polish problem - this has become a European problem and perhaps an international problem. There now needs to be a cohesive effort to deal with both the air accident investigation side and the human rights violations that have clearly occurred. ""There are some important questions to ask Russia. Most of the relatives are utterly traumatised. They've been waiting for eight years to discover the truth."" Russia says the crash has already been fully investigated.. Friends and relatives of those who died say an EU resolution calling for an independent inquiry has been ignored. Even so, they won't give up on their belief that the full story of the Polish air force flight is still to be revealed."
2018-02-02,"Not for the first time results today from AstraZeneca (AZ), the UK's second-largest drug maker, are something of a curate's egg.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180203065615/https://news.sky.com/story/astrazenecas-core-numbers-hide-pharma-firms-progress-11233535,"If there is cause for disappointment, it is that 2017 sales, at $22.5billion, were down 2% on 2016. Pascal Soriot, chief executive, had previously promised that 2017 would be the year that the Cambridge-based company's sales would start to grow again. Yet it ought not to have come as a surprise, given updates from AZ throughout the last year. And the good news is that, during the final three months of last year, AZ has, for the second consecutive quarter, achieved sales that were better than expected - while the 2% fall for the year as a whole was also better than the firm's City followers had been pencilling in. The same applies to the earnings. Headline pre-tax profits fell by 37%, to $2.3bn, due to higher costs and a decline in margins. Yet core operating profit, AZ's preferred measure, of $1.79bn during the final three months of the year was also better than expected - even if it was flattered by some one-off tax gains. So those are the numbers. The real meat of the statement came in news that product sales were actually up by 4% during the final three months of the year. That is important because there has been unease that AZ's total sales have been flattered in recent times by so-called ""externalisation"" revenues - which come from collaborations with third parties - and at a time when product sales, which make up the vast majority of AZ's sales, have been falling. So this is encouraging and not least because, more than any other global drugs company, AZ has been suffering from a ""patent cliff"" in which drugs are no longer protected by patent and therefore more vulnerable to cheap copycat versions. The rise in product sales suggests the impact of such patent expiries may be past its worst - good news for Mr Soriot, who successfully fought off Pfizer's unwanted bid in 2014 by convincing shareholders AZ's product pipeline was so strong they had more to gain, over the long run, from it remaining an independent company than by selling out for a short term profit. Accordingly, Mr Soriot argued today that AZ is ""steadily turning a corner"", highlighting that Brilinta, its heart attack drug, and Farxinga, its diabetes treatment, both achieved ""blockbuster"" status in the year by their sales going above $1bn for the first time. It is worth noting that neither are gaining sales sufficiently yet to make up for the decline in sales in existing blockbusters now shorn of patent protection, such as asthma treatment Symbicort, anti-cholesterol treatment Crestor and peptic ulcer treatment Nexium, are losing them. These latter three alone still account for 36% of AZ's product sales. But that is no cause for downheartedness. Possibly the most eye-catching development over the last 12 months concerns Tagrisso, AZ's lung cancer drug, which saw sales more than double during the year and which should achieve blockbuster status during 2018. It recently won approval from Chinese regulators, emphasising the importance to AZ of China, which now accounts for more than 10% of the company's total sales. It was not for nothing that Mr Soriot was among the business leaders accompanying Theresa May on her trip to China this week. Another point of interest is that while AZ has traditionally been best known for its expertise in treatments for respiratory ailments and in the treatment of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, cancer treatment is becoming an increasingly important therapy area for the company. Oncology last year accounted for a fifth of product sales and as Tagrisso and Lynparza, a treatment for ovarian cancer, continue to build momentum, that will only increase. Mr Soriot also namechecked Calquence, a blood cancer treatment approved by US regulators at the end of October and Imfinzi, a relatively new bladder cancer treatment, as ones to watch. AZ is probably not growing at the speed at which Mr Soriot promised it would be at this stage when, nearly four years ago, it escaped Pfizer's clutches. The failure of the so-called ""Mystic"" trial last summer, combining immunotherapy with oncology, was undoubtedly a disappointment. But, crucially, the company is doing enough to prove that it is moving in the right direction and delivering on promises made during the takeover battle and share price growth on Friday showed investors were satisfied with the progress."

""The West Ham United family is an inclusive one where, regardless of gender, age, ability, race, religion or sexual orientation, everybody feels welcome and included."" Mr Henry allegedly made the remarks to a newspaper after it obtained a leaked email in which he is reported to have written: ""We don't want any more Africans."" The Daily Mail claimed Mr Henry sent the email on 27 January to another senior West Ham official and an agent in response to an inquiry about a Cameroonian footballer. When the newspaper approached the football director for a response, he highlighted ""problems"" with former striker Diafra Sakho, who left the club on Monday for French side Rennes. He also reportedly said the club ""had three and we felt we didn't particularly want any more African players"". He said there was ""no reason"" for that decision, and it was ""nothing racist at all"". ""It's just sometimes they can have a bad attitude, "" he is reported to have said. ""We had problems with Sakho, with Diafra Sakho. We find that when they are not in the team they cause mayhem. It's nothing against the African race at all. ""I mean, look, there are top African players. There's not a problem with them. It's just sometimes they cause a lot of problems when they are not playing, as we had with Diafra. He's left, so great. It's nothing personal at all."" It was then put to Mr Henry that his remarks could be seen as discriminatory, to which he replied: ""In what way?"" He told the newspaper: ""Look, we have a great lad in (Cheikhou) Kouyate. He's brilliant - a great player for us. He's a good lad. ""But the likes of Sakho have caused mayhem. When he's not playing…he always wants a new deal. That's all it was. It was nothing discriminatory at all."" The Football Association is investigating the issue. West Ham manager David Moyes has since tried to distance the club from the alleged comments. ""The comments are wrong. We were signing two players from Africa on deadline day so I can only say they are wrong,"" he said. ""You can see the players the club has signed over the years - we sign good quality players, the best we can get. It doesn't matter where they are from."""

""London boroughs don't have nearly enough foster carers in their area, so children are sent to places like Thanet, which is a poor area with high unemployment and so has far more foster carers,"" he told Sky News. ""Thanet now has a large gang problem linked to London and part of that is London children who bring their gang links with them because these are kids who crave a sense of belonging and a sense of family."" :: Record number of children at risk of abuse or neglect in England Mr Luxmoore said he feared children could be left at risk of an exploitation scandal similar to those seen in other parts of the country.

The report said the coastal town was the 316th poorest in the UK for housing, wages and jobs, which Mr Luxmoore said was exacerbated by the number of children in care being relocated to the area. Figures show the number of children placed in Thanet by authorities other than Kent County Council rose from 193 in December 2016 to 240 last November. ""We are not against helping looked-after children, we are trying to protect them by stopping them being sent to places that are unsafe,"" said Mr Luxmoore. ""We are trying to provoke the Government into taking some responsibility for what's going on."" North Thanet MP Sir Roger Gale has been a vocal critic of how many youngsters in care are relocated, claiming they are better off ""in their own manor"" unless there is a risk of mental or physical assault. He claimed in December that social services often received ""no notification"" from the boroughs relocating the children. :: Police feel they are used as 'taxi service' for children in care An NSPCC spokesman told Sky News that moving children in foster care outside their local area was not ideal. ""The majority of children who need foster care have suffered from abuse and neglect in their birth families and they are taken into care to protect them from significant harm,"" the spokesman said. ""It is often challenging to find a local placement that will meet the child's needs but moving them outside their local area often makes it difficult to provide the best possible support to them. ""Going into care creates huge upheaval for any child so it is important to ensure they remain close to friends, wider family and support networks so that as little disruption as possible is made to their lives."" :: Anyone with concerns about a child can contact the NSPCC helpline on 0808 800 5000."

A release from the party also pointed out he holds no other paid positions and receives no income from any property. His long-time political ally and shadow chancellor John McDonnell was also revealed to have earned £87,353 and paid £24,099 over the same period. Mr McDonnell got a small dividend on ""modest savings"" in a credit union he helped to found but similarly performed no paid work that year, Labour added. Releasing the scanned copies of their tax returns, Mr Corbyn said tax avoidance and evasion would only be tackled ""if we have the political will do it"". ""We cannot expect the public to trust us as party leaders, if we are not prepared to be open and honest about our own tax arrangements,"" he added. The Islington North MP's statement revealed he gave £890 to charity last year and was also forced to pay £6,179 in one go due to an admin error. It is believed he was on the wrong tax code and so was automatically having tax collections deducted at a lower level. Mr McDonnell said he was sharing his tax return ""because I believe if you aspire to be in charge of the nation's finances then you should be as open and transparent about your own income as possible"". Issuing a challenge to Government ministers, he added: ""It is right that people in high office are subject to a high degree of scrutiny and I call on the Prime Minister and Chancellor to follow suit and publish their tax returns in full.""

Alumni include Oscar-winning animator Nick Park (Wallace And Gromit), BAFTA-winning directors Sarah Gavron (Suffragette) and Lynne Ramsay (We Need To Talk About Kevin), and award-winning cinematographers Charlotte Bruus Christensen (Molly's Game) and Roger Deakins (No Country For Old Men). Amongst them, the school's graduates have won an impressive 132 BAFTA awards, 10 Oscars and 49 Oscar nominations for their feature-film work. And now NFTS is to receive a gong of its very own; a BAFTA for its Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema. NFTS director Jonathan Wardle told Sky News: ""It's amazing. There's a real sense of pride that this place which puts such a tremendous amount of emphasis on doing things the right way, to the right quality, is being recognised by the industry."" The school credits its success to a diverse post-graduate curriculum that offers dozens of behind-the-lens film courses and encourages hands-on, collaborative learning. It also has industry-insiders on its teaching staff, like Oscar-nominated writer, producer and director Alex Garland (Ex-Machina, 28 Days Later). Garland told Sky News: ""What the school does is it creates communication between different departments and an understanding [that] the success of the individual is based on a collective success."" Regular group projects bring students from different disciplines to work together. The school's latest student film is a horror called The Good Samaritan, which was staged and shot in a warehouse on the school campus. Student Theo Boswell, who is on a two-year course in production design, designed and built the set, inspired by German gothic architecture, and says it's inspirational to know that previous alumni have gone on to enjoy successful careers in the industry. ""I think with each term of the course you begin to feel more confident that you'll be able to do something like that,"" Boswell, told Sky News. ""It feels more possible, tangible."" NFTS class sizes are kept deliberately small and to get a place at the school is highly competitive. But numerous bursaries and scholarships are available which encourages applications from a diverse-range of backgrounds. NFTS will receive its award at the British Academy Film and Television Awards ceremony on Sunday, 18 February."

Instead, the little girl was officially classed as a miscarriage, leaving her mother to ""come to terms"" with receiving no death certificate or formal acknowledgment of life. Ms Hodgson said even though she knew talking about it would leave her in ""floods of tears"", she had to speak out to urge a change in the law. She told a group of MPs of the birth certificate, world class care for a baby born so prematurely and birthday parties that never were. ""As I held her in my arms and had to come to terms with what had just happened, I also then had to come to terms with the fact that she officially did not exist,"" the Washington and Sunderland West MP said. ""Because she was pre-24 weeks she didn't even get the dignity to be classed as a still birth. ""Although that is what I always say she was if and when I talk about this tragedy - which as you can tell isn't very often."" There were no cold cots in the hospital, Ms Hodgson continued, wiping away tears, so she and her husband could not spend a final night with Lucy. The baby was given a blessing by the hospital chaplain and buried in a white coffin, in the same grave as Ms Hodgson's mother and grandfather. She said: ""I tell you all this to highlight that to the Chaplain, to the Co-op funeral service, to us, her family, she existed. ""She was a baby who sadly was born dead. Her heart beat throughout my labour - just up until minutes before she was born. She just couldn't make the final push into this world. ""And because of that, and because of the matter of a few days she doesn't officially exist in any records - other than in our memories and our own family records. ""Even the entry on the deeds for the grave is in my name, as if I, or in this case a bit of me, is buried there."" Ms Hodgson was speaking in a debate on the Civil Partnerships, Marriages and Deaths Bill in Parliament on Friday. She received support from multiple MPs, the Conservatives' Will Quince telling her: ""I think Lucy would be very proud of mummy today."""
2018-02-02,Islamophobic extremist Darren Osborne will spend at least 43 years in jail for his attack on Muslim worshippers.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180203065615/https://news.sky.com/story/finsbury-park-terrorist-darren-osborne-jailed-for-at-least-43-years-11233375,"The unemployed 48-year-old deliberately drove a hire van at a crowd leaving Ramadan prayers in Finsbury Park, north London, on 19 June last year. He was handed a life sentence, with a minimum term of 43 years, for killing 51-year-old Makram Ali and injuring 12 others. As he was taken down at Woolwich Crown Court on Friday, Osborne said: ""God bless you, thank you."" Some of Mr Ali's family were in tears as Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb spoke of the damage caused by the attacker's ""suicide mission"". Sentencing Osborne, the judge said: ""This was a terrorist attack. You intended to kill."" She added: ""Your mindset became one of malevolent hatred. In short you allowed your mind to be poisoned by those who claimed to be leaders."" Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb also criticised Osborne's ""pathetic last-ditch attempt"" to deceive a jury into believing an accomplice called ""Dave"" had been driving the hire van. Osborne, an alcoholic father-of-four, had previously been convicted of both murder and attempted murder for the 19 June attack, following a trial. The Met Police said ""warped"" Osborne had been ""radicalised"" in a matter of weeks prior to his attack. His estranged girlfriend, Sarah Andrews, said the ""total loner"" had become ""brainwashed"" and ""obsessed"" with Muslims since watching a TV drama about the Rochdale grooming scandal in May last year, along with two subsequent terror attacks in the UK. Speaking outside court after Osborne's sentencing on Friday, Mr Ali's daughter Ruzina Akhtar said the killer's denial of his crime was ""particularly hard"". She said: ""Before our father left the house that night, he had spent the evening with his family. It was here where he felt most comfortable. ""Our father - like the victims of most terrorism - was entirely innocent, which makes his death in this violent way all the more hurtful. ""We cannot imagine the trauma he felt in his last few minutes. But we choose to remember our father with happier thoughts."" Earlier, in a victim impact statement, the court heard Ms Akhtar describe how her mother is scared to go out alone ""in case she is attacked because she is visibly a Muslim who wears a headscarf"". Mr Ali, from Haringey, was a married father of four daughters and two teenage sons, as well as being a grandfather of two. Ms Akhtar said her own son was ""always asking where his grandad is and why he cannot go to the park every day to play with him any more"". During the sentencing, Osborne was revealed to have appeared before courts on 33 occasions for 102 offences over 30 years. Osborne's trial heard how mobile phones and tablets found at his family home revealed multiple searches for English Defence League (EDL) founder Tommy Robinson and Britain First deputy leader Jayda Fransen. Osborne was also said to have read articles on Lee Rigby, the British Army soldier killed in a terror attack in 2013, and used a search engine to ask: ""Which party wants to bring back the death penalty?"" On Friday, London mayor Sadiq Khan - whom Osborne had expressed a hope to kill - said: ""I think we need to think about how it is possible for somebody to be radicalised by extremists, whether it's the far-right, or those who are inspired by so-called Daesh, or so-called Islamist groups. ""We need to make sure we root out those extremists that are grooming and radicalising people to embark on the road to terrorism."" A Downing Street spokesman said he regarded Osborne's ""appalling and cowardly attack"" as an ""act of terrorism"". He added: ""The internet cannot be used as a safe space for terrorists or those who want to spread terrorist or extremist content."""
2018-02-02,"One in five lucrative bonuses paid to senior doctors went to a woman last year, prompting concerns that an ""old boys' club"" awards system is contributing to a gender pay gap in the NHS.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180203065615/https://news.sky.com/story/exclusive-nhs-boys-club-bonuses-spark-pay-gap-fears-11233531,"Sky News analysis of Clinical Excellence Awards (CEAs) paid to consultants in England and Wales in 2017 reveals that 20% of 318 awards worth more than £14m in total went to female applicants. The figure was down 2% on 2016. Analysis of the most valuable awards made over four years, from 2014 to 2017, shows that on average, women received only 20.5% of the bonuses. The figures also show that the higher the value of the award, the less likely it was to be received by a woman. A Sky News freedom of information request to hospital trusts in England found that women were more likely to receive lower-value CEAs, with around 30% receiving payments. That still falls below the proportion of female consultants in the NHS, around 33%, and both the Department of Health (DoH) and doctors' union the British Medical Association (BMA) accept that women are underrepresented in the system. CEAs are divided into 12 levels, ranging from £3,000 to just over £77,000, and are given to consultants who demonstrate they have contributed to improvements in patient care by working ""over and above"" their normal clinical or academic role. Once awarded, they are paid annually for at least five years and the payments are pensionable. :: Explained: How NHS consultants earn bonus payments Levels one through to eight range from £3,016 to £30,160, and are awarded by local hospital trusts, while levels nine to 12 - known as bronze, silver, gold and platinum and worth between £36,192 and £77,320 - are awarded by a national panel appointed by the DoH. The figures show women who apply are almost as likely as men to be successful, with around 25% of male and female candidates receiving awards. However, in the three years from 2014-2016, some 813 women applied for CEAs - compared with 3,124 men. Senior female doctors and NHS executives say women are not encouraged to apply and that the system does not take account of the different career paths and challenges facing women. Because the awards are incremental and applications are annual, any women taking a career pause to have children, or working part-time and therefore less able to take on extra responsibilities, is at a disadvantage. Sky News has spoken to a range of female consultants, NHS executives and specialist professionals who raised misgivings about the system, though few were willing to speak on-camera for fear of damaging their prospects in future. ""It’s an iniquitous, subjective system that rewards those in managerial posts, while the rest of us take care of the daily clinical work,"" one experienced female consultant told us. A senior hospital trust executive described it as ""an old boys' club that should be scrapped,"" while a lawyer with extensive experience of consultant contract negotiation said the system was ""a legal challenge waiting to happen"". Jane Dacre, president of the Royal College of Physicians and one of the most senior female doctors in the NHS, said: ""It does not seem right to me that only 20% of awards are given to women and it is not right that the higher up the food chain you go, the less likely women are to get them. We can explain some of it away, but not all of it."" Sally Davies, until last year the president of the Women’s Medicine Federation, told Sky News the system was a relic of a time when medicine was male dominated. ""It was designed when it was mainly men in the system looking after other men,"" she said. ""It makes you question whether women in medicine are valued. They are the ones in the NHS running the system, ie they are too busy with patient care, raising standards, (rather) than actually sitting down and applying for an award. ""It also makes you ask, are they being encouraged? Is somebody tapping them on the shoulder at their annual appraisal or something and saying, 'this is wonderful work, you should put in for an award'?"" The BMA and the DoH declined requests for interview, but the CEA system is likely to be reviewed as part of negotiations over new consultant contracts. The BMA has already threatened legal action if the Government attempts to remove them from any new deal. A spokesperson for the BMA said: “Clearly more needs to be done to make them [CEAs] both fair and representative at a local and national level. ""Through recent contract negotiations the BMA has proposed improvements to the CEA system to ensure the process is open and transparent, but the culture around recognition needs to improve so that more women feel empowered to apply."" The DoH said women were as likely to be as successful if they applied, but accepted they were under-represented in the number of applications. ""We are working to reform local CEAs as part of the wider consultant contract negotiations – in the meantime we expect employers to run a fair, open and transparent awards scheme,"" said a spokesperson. NHS Scotland and the NHS in Northern Ireland do not have comparable schemes."

Crystal Palace are the only Premier League side to still have a cheerleading squad at matches, with other top-flight clubs - including London rivals West Ham - having previously ditched their on-pitch dancers. Last week, the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) announced it will no longer use ""walk on girls"" following talks with broadcasters. That decision was followed by Formula One declaring ""grid girls"" will not be employed from this year, with organisers saying the practice did not fit with the sport's ""brand values"" and is ""at odds with modern day societal norms"". It sparked claims on social media that Crystal Palace's cheerleaders could also be deemed to be ""out of date"". All professional dancers over the age of 21, ""The Crystals"" choose their own outfits to wear at home matches, which they attend three hours before kick-off to interact with fans. They train at least four hours a week and are also regularly seen at the club's charity fundraising events, for which they are unpaid.

""They also raise substantial amounts of money for good causes throughout the year. We are proud of our association with them.""

There are 12 levels of award, worth between £3,016 for level 1 and £77,320 for platinum or level 12. Consultants can apply every year and if successful they receive the payments annually for at least five years. Levels 1-8 are awarded by local hospital trusts while levels 9-12, known as bronze, silver, gold and platinum, are decided by a panel appointed by the Department of Health. More than 300 bronze, silver, gold and platinum awards are made every year, but as they are paid annually more than 2,300 consultants currently receive payments worth more than £106m, according to the latest published list. Analysis of consultants named as having received bronze, silver, gold and platinum awards in 2017 shows that 318 successful applicants shared payments worth £14m, but only 20% were women. Over a four year period from 2014 women received 19.3% of the top level awards. A Sky News Freedom of Information request to NHS trusts in England revealed that women were more likely to receive the lower value Levels 1-8. Analysis of responses from 44 Trusts showed that 30% of awards went to women. Women are as successful as men if they apply, with around 25% of candidates of both genders receiving awards, and the success rate for women has increased in recent years. But senior female doctors and professional groups believe the system has an inherent bias in favour of men, who make up two-thirds of the consultant workforce. Because the system is incremental and requires doctors to show continued development and work beyond their day jobs every year, it may penalise women who have career breaks to raise children, as well as those who work part-time because of childcare demands. Sally Davies, Medical Women's Federation ""You don't suddenly become eligible and suitable for an award, you work at it, you do things, you enjoy things, you add things to your portfolio, and often that's a time for women when you might be part-time, when they might have young children at home and be the person that does most of the childcare. ""So given the choice of being a Royal College Examiner or sitting on a national committee which takes you away from home, women may not be in the position to commit the time.

The 62-year-old smiled as the crowds gathered, and uttered his last words to her. ""Well, hi, Mary Jean,"" he said. ""I'll see y'all later. Bye."" He then told the prison officer: ""Go ahead, please."" Battaglia reopened his eyes a few seconds after he was injected, and asked if he was still alive as the powerful sedative took hold. He then said, 'Oh, I feel it,' before gasping twice and snoring. Ms Pearle said: ""I've seen enough of him."" The official time of death was given as 9.40pm on Thursday (3.40am on Friday in the UK), 22 minutes after the injection was administered. Battaglia killed his daughters Faith, nine, and Liberty, six, during a scheduled visit a year after his divorce from Ms Pearle. His ex-wife was forced to listen as the older girl shouted, ""No, Daddy, please don't do it."" She shouted for the girls to run as she heard the gunshots. At the time of the killings, Battaglia was on probation for an attack at Christmas 1999 on his then-wife. After he killed the girls, he said: ""Merry f****** Christmas."" Faith was shot three times, and Liberty five. Battaglia was found in a tattoo parlour afterwards, having two roses inked on his arm to commemorate them. It took four officers to restrain him. In 2014, he said the girls had been his ""best little friends"", and added: ""I don't feel like I killed them. ""I am a little bit in the blank about what happened."" The lethal injection was administered following a failed attempt to spare Battaglia by lawyers, who said he was mentally ill. Lawyers for Texas argued he understood what he had done, and the US Supreme Court granted the execution."
2018-02-02,Post-Brexit anxiety among Britons is said to be creating a surge in UK holidays.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180203065615/https://news.sky.com/story/surge-in-staycations-due-to-post-brexit-anxiety-11234187,"Bookings look set to make 2018 another bumper year for domestic tourism and industry experts say the ""staycation"" trend is becoming a sustained feature. Tourism and marketing expert Dr Sheila Malone of Lancaster University said there had been a noticeable movement in trends following the Brexit referendum. She told Sky News: ""That seemed to trigger a different kind of consumer sentiment in terms of spending - a little bit more cautious, looking for a bit more security in how they (British holidaymakers) are spending their money... There's a shift in the tourism landscape probably driven by the nervousness and anxiousness around Brexit."" Latest figures support the theory. Visit Britain says that in 2017 there was another 4% rise in holiday trips taken by Brits in England. That's on top of an 11% increase in domestic overnight trips in the 10 years since 2006. Butlins says bookings are up 7.5% on this time last year. Its research has identified a post-Brexit sense of nostalgia. The company’s communications director Andrew French said: ""There’s a lot of sentimental attachment to the British seaside so we will see guests who come and want to tell their families about the holidays they had by the seaside skimming stones, walking along the beach or going to the fair."" The Caravanning and Camping Club also says that early indications for 2018 are positive with a 10% increase across its 106 campsites compared to last year. Blackpool landlady Claire Smith has been in the businesses for 26 years and has witnessed the highs and lows of holiday trends over that time. ""We've had some glory years, then we had the declining years... 2016 saw a turnaround,"" she said. ""There is most definitely a serious trend emerging now for the staycation. If you go back years and years people used to come to Blackpool for a fortnight, then they'd come for a week, then they'd come for a couple of days. Now they're staying for three or four days. That's new."" Dr Malone believes that nostalgia is a key factor in the psychology behind the latest figures. ""There’s been a renewed interest in what's on our own doorstep, looking to what traditionally would have been a 19th century style holiday... your fish and chips by the seaside, your ice-creams on the promenade. We've seen a revival of beach huts and donkey rides."""

It alleges the FBI used unsubstantiated allegations by former British spy Christopher Steele to obtain a warrant to monitor a Trump campaign aide. It also claims the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court was not told Mr Steele was demonstrably anti-Trump and that the research was funded by the Clinton campaign The release of the previously classified memo has led to speculation that Mr Wray could resign after only six months in the job. But in an internal note to the FBI's 35,000 staff he told them he was determined to stand up for the organisation. ""You've all been through a lot in the past nine months and I know it's often been unsettling, to say the least,"" wrote Mr Wray. ""And the past few days haven't done much to calm those waters... Let me be clear: I stand fully committed to our mission... I stand with you."" Despite not referencing the memo of the President specifically, Mr Wray told staff he was ""determined to defend your integrity and professionalism every day"", adding: ""Talk is cheap; the work you do is what will endure"". Leading Democrats have warned of a ""constitutional crisis"" and told Donald Trump not to use the memo as a means of disrupting and discrediting the Russia investigation. In a letter to the Persident, Democrats warned him against using the four-page document as a ""pretext"" to sack Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein or Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is overseeing the investigation. ""Firing Rod Rosenstein, DOJ (Department of Justice) leadership, or Bob Mueller could result in a constitutional crisis of the kind not seen since the Saturday night massacre,"" the Democrats wrote, referencing Richard Nixon's firing of the Watergate scandal prosecutor. The White House insisted there had been no discussions about firing Mr Rosenstein. The assurance comes despite reporters asking Mr Trump on Friday if he had confidence in the Deputy Attorney General and the President replying: ""You figure that one out."" Speaking of the claims in the memo, Mr Trump said: ""A lot of people should be ashamed."" ""I think it's terrible,"" he said. ""You want to know the truth. I think it's a disgrace. What's going on in this country, I think it's a disgrace."" White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the memo ""raises serious concerns about the integrity of decisions made at the highest levels of the Department of Justice and the FBI to use the Government's most intrusive surveillance tools against American citizens"". The FBI, DOJ and Democrats - who say the memo uses cherry-picked classified details - had all pushed to stop its release, saying it could harm national security. Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi accused Mr Trump of ""sending his friend Putin a bouquet"", calling it a ""desperate attempt to distract the American people from the truth about the Trump-Russia scandal"". Sky News US Correspondent Cordelia Lynch said a ""big partisan political battle"" was brewing. ""You now have the President at odds with the intelligence community, ploughing ahead despite the FBI's grave concerns and some central allegations within this memo that Republicans believe prove that the FBI was biased,"" she said. Former FBI Director James Comey, who Mr Trump fired in May, savaged the decision to release the memo. He tweeted: ""That’s it? Dishonest and misleading memo wrecked the House intel committee, destroyed trust with Intelligence Community, damaged relationship with FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance) court, and inexcusably exposed classified investigation of an American citizen.

2018-02-04,"Thousands of motorists could be unwittingly driving without insurance because of fraudsters known as ""ghost brokers"" selling fake policies, police have warned.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180205073704/https://news.sky.com/story/ghost-broker-scam-police-warn-thousands-of-motorists-may-have-fake-car-insurance-11236464,"Detectives received more than 850 reports of the scam in the last three years, with victims losing an estimated total of £631,000, according to City of London officers. But the force said the actual number of victims could be much higher as drivers are often unaware their policy is invalid. Tactics used by ""ghost brokers"" include taking out a genuine insurance policy before quickly cancelling it and claiming the refund plus the victim's money. They also forge insurance documents or falsify a driver's details to bring the price down, police said. Men aged in their 20s are most likely to be targeted, with ""ghost brokers"" often contacting victims on social media including Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and WhatsApp. :: Motor insurance premiums hit record high They also advertise on student websites or money-saving forums, university notice boards and marketplace websites and may sell insurance policies in pubs, clubs or bars, newsagents and car repair shops. A national campaign has now been launched to warn drivers to be wary of heavily discounted policies on the internet or cheap insurance prices they are offered directly. Some victims only realise they do not have genuine cover when they are stopped by police or try to make an insurance claim after an accident, detectives said. Police have taken action in 417 cases linked to ""ghost broking"" in the last three years, including one man who set up 133 fake policies and another man who earned £59,000 from the scam. Drivers without valid car insurance are breaking the law and face punishments including fines, points on their driving licence and having their vehicles seized. Detective Chief Inspector Andy Fyfe said: ""Ghost brokers trick unsuspecting victims with offers of heavily discounted car insurance, leaving them with a policy that isn't worth the paper it's written on and open to the severe harm that comes with driving without valid insurance. ""Being able to drive is vital for a lot people, whether it be to get to work or pick up their children from school or nursery, so if they fall victim to a ghost broker it could not only impact on them financially but also seriously affect their day to day life and make things very difficult."""
2018-02-04,"The Royal Marines would struggle to carry out a ""substantial"" amphibious landing if proposals to get rid of two specialised ships are approved, say MPs.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180205073704/https://news.sky.com/story/royal-marines-at-risk-if-amphibious-ships-scrapped-11236133,"Their potential loss - prompted by ""short-term Treasury bookkeeping"" - would seriously undermine the country's security and could even spell ""sunset for the Royal Marines"", according to a Commons Defence Committee report. Two thousand Marines - about 30% - would be culled if the plans are signed off, the MPs say. HMS Albion and HMS Bulwark are ""essential for landing personnel, heavy equipment and supplies on a beach"" and ""their disposal would remove any prospect of the Armed Forces achieving a successful amphibious landing with a substantial force"", says the report. They can deploy smaller landing craft loaded with equipment and Royal Marines for a coastal assault. Other ships touted as possible replacements, such as aircraft carriers, are no substitute, it is claimed. The committee adds: ""Every other major defence power is seeking to increase its amphibious capabilities at the very time that the UK may be forced prematurely to abandon them."" The Royal Marines have already seen their numbers drop from 7,020 to 6,580 since 2011. ""Given the disproportionate contribution the Royal Marines make to defence and the sheer range and versatility of their military skills, both they and the country's security would be significantly undermined,"" the report says. The leaked proposals are from the National Security Capability Review (NSCR), which the Defence Committee claims has been carried out behind closed doors without adequate input from experts. It wants to question the National Security Adviser about the proposals - which it calls ""drastic and dangerous"". Committee chairman Julian Lewis wants the Government to boost defence spending back to 3% of GDP. He said he was assured by the defence procurement minister last January that the Albion and the Bulwark would be in service until 2033 and 2034. The rethink shows ""this is being forced on the Ministry of Defence by the Treasury"", Mr Lewis said. But some experts believe the Committee may be wrong to insist on keeping the ships. Former Royal Navy officer Rear Admiral Chris Parry told Sky News: ""They are right that we should preserve as many Royal Marines as we can - they are our primary elite forces and I think we are going to need them in the future. ""I don't think they are right about retaining the amphibious ships at all costs because the future operating environment will change."""
2018-02-04,"Suffragettes are seen as selfless today but in the early 1900s they were regarded as terrorists, historian Simon Webb writes.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180205073704/https://news.sky.com/story/women-would-have-got-the-vote-earlier-if-not-for-suffragette-terrorists-11227772,"Even the mildest criticism of the suffragettes makes many people feel uneasy. The image which we have of them today is that of selfless and patient women, enduring imprisonment, hunger strikes and the horror of force-feeding in pursuit of what was surely a just cause; that of equality of rights between men and women. Their weapons were, we have been led to suppose, those of passive resistance and peaceful protest, rather than violence against others. The worst they might have done is break windows or chain themselves to railings. This popular perception is quite false; the suffragette movement was actually a terrorist organisation. In the years leading up to the First World War, the suffragettes conducted a ferocious and prolonged bombing campaign across the whole of the United Kingdom; planting Improvised Explosive Devices or IEDs in places as varied as Westminster Abbey, St Paul's Cathedral, the Bank of England, the National Gallery, railway stations and many other locations. :: The women who risked all to get the vote The first terrorist bomb to explode in Ireland in the twentieth century was planted not by the IRA, but by the suffragettes. They also invented the letter bomb; designed to maim or kill those with whom they disagreed. One of the first bomb attacks carried out by the suffragettes was on the house of Chancellor of the Exchequer Lloyd George. At a little after 6.00am on 19 February 1913, a bomb exploded at the house which the Chancellor was having decorated. The bomb, which brought down ceilings and cracked walls, was planted by none other than Emily Davison, who later died beneath the hoofs of the king's horse at the 1913 Derby. There is currently talk of erecting a statue of Emmeline Pankhurst near Parliament, which is a little strange when we consider how unpopular terrorists are these days. Pankhurst was the leader of the suffragette terrorists. After the explosion at Lloyd George's house, she was brought to trial at the Old Bailey for complicity in the attack and sentenced to three years imprisonment. Those planning the bombings were not lone wolves or mavericks; they were being directed and supported by the suffragette leadership. :: I'm glad history is finally recognising my Suffragette great-great-grandmother The day after Mrs Pankhurst was sent to prison, a bomb was placed outside the Bank of England. Fortunately, a policeman managed to defuse it before it detonated in the crowded street. For the next sixteen months, the bomb attacks came thick and fast. Some, such as the one planted in St Paul's Cathedral on 7 May 1913, failed to explode. Others, for instance a large device at the Royal Observatory in Edinburgh a fortnight later, did go off, causing a great deal of damage. The wave of bombings led to a hardening in the government's position, as well as alienating those who supported the idea of a change in the law to allow women the vote. There had been every chance before the bombings began that a private member's bill to introduce the vote for women might succeed in getting through Parliament. Few politicians wished though to be seen giving in to terrorism and, as a result, this bill failed even to gain a second reading. After the failure of the bill, it was plain that the suffragette bombers were harming the struggle for women's civil rights far more than they were aiding it. :: Opinion: 'Suffragettes were inspirational - not terrorists' Throughout 1913 and the first half of 1914, the bomb attacks increased; striking places as diverse as Holloway Prison and the changing rooms at Cambridge University's football ground. Churches became prime targets, because of a perceived opposition of the Church of England to women's rights. Among the churches where bombs exploded were St Martin-in-the-Fields, in Trafalgar Square, Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland, famous from The Da Vinci Code, and, on 11 June 1914, Westminster Abbey; damaging to the Coronation Chair. The last bomb of the campaign exploded at Christ Church Cathedral in the Irish town of Lisburn, on 1 August 1914. That same day, Germany declared war on Russia and then, two days later, on France. The First World War had begun. With the outbreak of the war, the suffragettes abandoned their activities and threw themselves into the war effort. The struggle to win the vote was forgotten in an upsurge of patriotic feeling. The terrorist bombings carried out by the suffragettes have today been almost wholly forgotten; replaced with a sanitised view of the activists as people who would do nothing more dangerous than break the occasional shop window. Far from hastening the granting of votes for women, the suffragettes impeded the political progress towards this aim by their dangerous actions; causing most people to reject them as violent fanatics. Had it not been for the bombings, there is every chance that the vote would have been given to women before, rather than after the First World War."

He also praised Mr Corbyn for being among ""people who were open to conversation"" on achieving a peace settlement in Northern Ireland. Mr Corbyn has consistently faced scrutiny over his links with Sinn Fein and Irish Republicans during the 1980s and 1990s - a period of bombings and shootings at the height of ""The Troubles"". He has also reiterated his support for a united Ireland since becoming Labour leader. Asked what difference it would make to the Republican cause if Mr Corbyn were to become Prime Minister, Mr Adams told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""I would like to see Jeremy in that position (as Prime Minister) for the benefit of people in Britain, leaving Ireland out of it. ""I think Jeremy is an outstanding politician and I hope my endorsement of him is not used against him in the time ahead. ""He and (former London mayor) Ken Livingstone and others kept faith and they were the people who said, when others said no, 'talk'. ""They were the people who were open to conversation about how to deal with conflict and how to get conflict resolution processes."" Mr Livingstone is currently suspended from the Labour Party following his comments about anti-Semitism, Hitler and Zionism. Mr Adams admitted a united Ireland was not ""inevitable"", adding: ""It's only going to happen if we work at it. ""I come from a very, very straightforward position. I want to see an end to the British connection with Ireland."" But he warned Irish Republicans to be ""very, very careful"" that they are not seen to view the UK's ""disastrous"" departure from the EU as ""something that can be exploited"". He repeated his demand for Northern Ireland to be given ""special designated status"" within the EU as ""doable"", but ruled out Sinn Fein taking their seats in the House of Commons in order to help influence the direction of Brexit. After a surge in support for his party at both local and Westminster elections last year, Mr Adams said: ""We, when we get a mandate, obey that mandate and stay true to that mandate. ""That vote was a vote for no British involvement in our affairs. The centre of political gravity being on the island of Ireland. ""So we will not betray those people who had a choice."" Mr Adams, who will be standing down as head of Sinn Fein later this month, admitted he is ""concerned"" the possibility of a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit might see a return of violence. He later claimed the IRA ""has gone"" as he explained his ""consistent"" position towards the paramilitary group. ""I was not a member of the IRA, but I've never distanced myself from the IRA,"" he said. Mr Adams' support for Mr Corbyn came as the Labour leader was put under further pressure on his position on Brexit. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable has written to Mr Corbyn to urge him to support a second EU referendum, even though the Labour leader has previously ruled it out. Sir Vince used his own appearance on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show to accuse Mr Corbyn of ""collusion"" with the Conservatives in enabling Brexit. Meanwhile, pro-Remain Labour MP Chuka Umunna urged Mr Corbyn to put their party ""on the right side of history"" as he repeated his call for another vote on the UK's relationship with the EU."
2018-02-04,A senior Yemeni Commander has told Sky News the government is winning the civil war.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180205073704/https://news.sky.com/story/yemen-commander-claims-government-winning-civil-war-in-which-10000-have-died-11237344,"Speaking from recently captured ground on top of Mount Nmeh, General Nasser al Dhaybani said his troops are moving closer to the capital Sana'a ""every day"" and will retake it ""as soon as the conditions are right"". He described controversial Saudi airstrikes as ""excellent"" and ""helpful"" but said he did not want to destroy the city because ""there are two million civilians there and they are also Yemenis"". ""Instead we are taking the mountains around it,"" he said. :: Global security depends on end of Yemen war The officer's optimism is at odds with a conflict that has reached a grim stalemate in many areas and will enter its fourth year next month. The frontline has been relatively static, taking months to move only a few miles. At some points the two sides are so close they can shout insults at one another. The rebel Houthis have controlled Sana'a since September 2014. Since then, 10,000 people are estimated to have been killed in the war, many of them civilians. :: Yemen: The civil war and humanitarian crisis explained More than 20 million have been displaced from their homes as a result of the fighting, and a cholera and diphtheria epidemic is sweeping the country. Aid agencies estimate as many as eight million people are hovering on the brink of starvation. The Houthis have recently fired Iranian-supplied ballistic missiles at neighbouring Saudi Arabia - one landed close to Riyadh's main commercial airport. Saudi Arabia responded by re-imposing a naval and air blockade which has prevented vital food and medical supplies from reaching those in need. Stephen Anderson, director of the UN's World Food Programme in Yemen, described the crisis as ""entirely man-made"". ""Unfortunately Yemen right now is faced with the world's worst humanitarian crisis,"" he told Sky News. ""75% of the population, around 22 million people, need some form of humanitarian assistance. ""About half of those people are in acute need - that means they really need life-saving support for them to just survive."" :: 'Coup' adds to chaos in war-ravaged Yemen as 15 killed in fighting Sky News was given rare access to a country that has at times proved hard for journalists and aid agencies to enter. We were flown into Yemen on an aid flight operated by the Royal Saudi Air Force. The visit came a week after Riyadh announced a £1.06bn humanitarian package for Yemen. In the government controlled city of Ma'rib, men, women and children wait for prosthetic limbs to replace the arms and legs they lost to landmines left behind by the retreating Houthis. One man told us he had been waiting three years for treatment, and a 17-year-old boy explained how he lost his leg after joining up to fight in his school holidays. The director of Ma'rib General hospital, Dr Mohamed al Kobati, said he had to serve a population of two million people over five provinces, with only 120 beds. ""Most of the cases, they are trauma cases from the war,"" he said. Referring to war casualties, he explained most did not make it to hospital. ""It takes time to reach (hospital), they are suffering from bleeding, severe bleeding. So most of them die."""

There had been much speculation as to how Timberlake would pay tribute to Prince as the NFL Super Bowl came to Minneapolis, the Purple Rain singer's hometown. The stakes were high as this year's Super Bowl LII between the New England Patriots and underdog Philadelphia Eagles was predicted to have attracted more than 110m viewers, raking in $5m every 30 seconds. :: Eagles stun Patriots for first Super Bowl crown The crowd seemed impressed with his cover as they were bathed in purple light and a haze of smoke in tribute to Prince, who died in April 2016 of an accidental overdose. Fans had feared a tasteless hologram of Prince performing would feature, but Timberlake kept it respectful as he settled into the iconic tune half way through his performance. The former NSync member showed off his dancing skills as he sang his recent single Filthy during what many saw as his comeback. Timberlake also sang a medley of his best-known songs, including SexyBack, Senorita, Cry Me A River and Can't Stop The Feeling. He previously described Prince as having a ""huge influence"" on him and voiced ""heartfelt words of respect"" for The Purple One. Luckily, Timberlake managed to avoid any scandal following his last Super Bowl appearance in 2004 in which he swiped his hand across Janet Jackson's chest as she performed, exposing one of her breasts. Her nipple, covered with a metal nipple shield, was exposed to the US' biggest TV audience, prompting a $550,000 fine for broadcaster CBS for indecency. There was much anticipation over Jackson joining Timberlake on stage, but just before the game she made it clear she would not be performing. Timberlake's camouflage suit with a shirt sporting two deer did however raise eyebrows with the fashion police. Despite having famous quarterback Tom Brady in their arsenal the Patriots failed to win their third Super Bowl in four years, handing the Vince Lombardi trophy over to the Eagles who secured a 41-33 win."
2018-02-04,A potentially hazardous chemical used in certain plastic food packaging has been found in the digestive system of 86% of teenagers who took part in a recent study.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180205073704/https://news.sky.com/story/food-packaging-chemical-bpa-found-in-digestive-system-of-86-of-teenagers-11236098,"The University of Exeter research looked at Bisphenol A (BPA), which makes plastics flexible but strong. Some studies have suggested that the chemical could be linked to breast cancer and heart disease and there have been calls for it to be banned. However, others believe that stance is misleading. BPA, which has been used since the 1960s, is often found in the white lining inside tinned foods, drinks cans and bottle tops. Even till receipts, DVDs and processed foods are known to contain it. Researchers studied 94 teenagers and found it was almost impossible for them to avoid BPA products. Professor Lorna Harries, who led the project, is calling for clearer labelling on packaging so people can make informed choices when doing their food shopping. ""Teenagers are one of the groups of people in our population that have the highest levels of BPA in their urine when you measure it,"" she said. ""Although we’re not quite sure why that is, one theory is because teenagers eat more junk food than the rest of the population and junk food is a particularly rich source of BPA."" Freya Hester, 17, who took part in the study, said: ""I am really passionate about plastic pollution so knowing BPA is in here, we are polluting our bodies as well as the environment, which is really shocking to me."" Another participant, Amalia Gimbuta, told Sky News: ""If you're in a rush and you're shopping you don't have time to peel off the packaging to try and work out if it has BPA or not. ""So finding packaging that you know for certain doesn't have it in is really difficult."" Whilst some research suggests that low levels of BPA do not do any harm, the European Commission recently ruled it was a threat to human health because of its effect on people's hormones. In Canada and some American states it is no longer used in baby bottles, and last month the Commission decided to restrict its use in food packaging because of the potential side effects. Chief Executive of Breast Cancer UK Lynn Ladbrook said: ""BPA is listed as a substance of very high concern for good reason - it is both a reproductive toxicant and has endocrine disrupting properties. ""Breast Cancer UK has long called for BPA to be prohibited from use in food, drinks and till receipts and until it is, it is likely to continue to show up in humans."" However, some insist the chemical is safe and that there is not enough clear evidence to suggest otherwise. The British Plastics Federation has sought to reassure the public, calling recent campaigns misleading. In a statement, it said: ""BPA is one of the most studied chemicals in recent history and the current safety measures were reaffirmed as safe for adults, children and unborn children by the European Food Standards Agency (EFSA) as recently as October 2016, and the UK Food Standards Agency officially supports these conclusions. ""The British Plastics Federation also supports these conclusions: at current exposure levels, plastics containing BPA pose no health risk for any age group."""

2018-02-04,"Not for the first time results today from AstraZeneca (AZ), the UK's second-largest drug maker, are something of a curate's egg.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180205073704/https://news.sky.com/story/astrazenecas-core-numbers-hide-pharma-firms-progress-11233535,"If there is cause for disappointment, it is that 2017 sales, at $22.5billion, were down 2% on 2016. Pascal Soriot, chief executive, had previously promised that 2017 would be the year that the Cambridge-based company's sales would start to grow again. Yet it ought not to have come as a surprise, given updates from AZ throughout the last year. And the good news is that, during the final three months of last year, AZ has, for the second consecutive quarter, achieved sales that were better than expected - while the 2% fall for the year as a whole was also better than the firm's City followers had been pencilling in. The same applies to the earnings. Headline pre-tax profits fell by 37%, to $2.3bn, due to higher costs and a decline in margins. Yet core operating profit, AZ's preferred measure, of $1.79bn during the final three months of the year was also better than expected - even if it was flattered by some one-off tax gains. So those are the numbers. The real meat of the statement came in news that product sales were actually up by 4% during the final three months of the year. That is important because there has been unease that AZ's total sales have been flattered in recent times by so-called ""externalisation"" revenues - which come from collaborations with third parties - and at a time when product sales, which make up the vast majority of AZ's sales, have been falling. So this is encouraging and not least because, more than any other global drugs company, AZ has been suffering from a ""patent cliff"" in which drugs are no longer protected by patent and therefore more vulnerable to cheap copycat versions. The rise in product sales suggests the impact of such patent expiries may be past its worst - good news for Mr Soriot, who successfully fought off Pfizer's unwanted bid in 2014 by convincing shareholders AZ's product pipeline was so strong they had more to gain, over the long run, from it remaining an independent company than by selling out for a short term profit. Accordingly, Mr Soriot argued today that AZ is ""steadily turning a corner"", highlighting that Brilinta, its heart attack drug, and Farxinga, its diabetes treatment, both achieved ""blockbuster"" status in the year by their sales going above $1bn for the first time. It is worth noting that neither are gaining sales sufficiently yet to make up for the decline in sales in existing blockbusters now shorn of patent protection, such as asthma treatment Symbicort, anti-cholesterol treatment Crestor and peptic ulcer treatment Nexium, are losing them. These latter three alone still account for 36% of AZ's product sales. But that is no cause for downheartedness. Possibly the most eye-catching development over the last 12 months concerns Tagrisso, AZ's lung cancer drug, which saw sales more than double during the year and which should achieve blockbuster status during 2018. It recently won approval from Chinese regulators, emphasising the importance to AZ of China, which now accounts for more than 10% of the company's total sales. It was not for nothing that Mr Soriot was among the business leaders accompanying Theresa May on her trip to China this week. Another point of interest is that while AZ has traditionally been best known for its expertise in treatments for respiratory ailments and in the treatment of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, cancer treatment is becoming an increasingly important therapy area for the company. Oncology last year accounted for a fifth of product sales and as Tagrisso and Lynparza, a treatment for ovarian cancer, continue to build momentum, that will only increase. Mr Soriot also namechecked Calquence, a blood cancer treatment approved by US regulators at the end of October and Imfinzi, a relatively new bladder cancer treatment, as ones to watch. AZ is probably not growing at the speed at which Mr Soriot promised it would be at this stage when, nearly four years ago, it escaped Pfizer's clutches. The failure of the so-called ""Mystic"" trial last summer, combining immunotherapy with oncology, was undoubtedly a disappointment. But, crucially, the company is doing enough to prove that it is moving in the right direction and delivering on promises made during the takeover battle and share price growth on Friday showed investors were satisfied with the progress."

The former Apprentice contestant later explained her use of the painkilling drug, writing: ""I receive medical ketamine for a serious dislocation."" Hopkins suffers from epilepsy, which has left her with weakened shoulders. She is in South Africa filming a documentary, reporting on what she calls ""the systemic slaughter of white farmers in South Africa"". The 42-year-old has been producing short videos and articles for her website, Hopkinsworld, and Canadian far-right website The Rebel Media. Hopkins later shared images of media requests for further information about her use of ketamine, criticising journalists for not showing an interest in the reports she is producing on her trip. She is attempting to crowdfund $30,000 towards the cost of the expedition. Last year was a difficult one for Hopkins, who lost an expensive libel case against food blogger Jack Monroe, was dropped from her role as a MailOnline columnist and had her LBC radio show taken off air."
2018-02-04,Medics from the UK have this weekend returned from Bangladesh after fighting a diphtheria outbreak in the Rohingya refugee camps. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180205073704/https://news.sky.com/story/nhs-medics-prevent-epidemic-among-rohingya-11234902,"The team of 40 NHS doctors, nurses and paramedics triaged more than 3,000 people, and treated more than 500 for diphtheria, most of them children. Before the teams arrived, the outbreak was on the verge of becoming an epidemic. Dozens of refugees had already died, and more than 150 new cases were being reported every day. The UK's emergency medical team, which was stationed at three treatment centres, administered precautionary antibiotics and life-saving diphtheria anti-toxins to people in the camps. By the time they left, the number of new cases presenting daily was down to single figures. Stephen Owens is a consultant in paediatric infectious diseases who usually works in Newcastle. He has previously worked as an emergency volunteer in Sierra Leone during the Ebola outbreak. He said: ""The conditions for the refugees are very basic, to say the least. ""But what struck me is the willingness of the Rohingya to try and make the camp a community. These are not downtrodden people who have given up. They are desperately trying to make a life for themselves."" The six-week deployment, made at the request of the World Health Organisation, was the first of its kind since the team was set up in 2016. The work of the emergency aid teams has been supported by a UNICEF vaccination programme. The Department for International Development (DfID) said the first round of the vaccination campaign was complete, and had ensured more than 350,000 children aged between six weeks and 15 years are protected. About £2m of the £3.4m cost of the vaccination programme came from DfID's Bangladesh humanitarian aid budget. International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt has praised the ""vital work"" of the British team. She said: ""I have nothing but admiration and thanks for the UK medics who travelled to Cox's Bazar over the New Year to help victims of diphtheria, who without UK support would have died."" Diphtheria can cause extreme breathing difficulties and inflammation of the heart, which can lead to heart failure, damage to the nervous system and fatal paralysis. But despite the team's success in halting the risk of a widespread outbreak, the problems for the Rohingya in Bangladesh are far from over. There are new refugees fleeing Myanmar and entering the camps every day. And in just a few weeks, the cyclone season will start. Something for which the Rohingya, in their city of temporary tents and shacks, are ill prepared to deal with."

The warning lights flashed as the engine cut out and they stopped the car and got out just as flames appeared from under the vehicle. Alpine is now investigating the incident after the car was engulfed by the flames in just four minutes. Harris and Jordan, who were wearing fireproof overalls and gloves, did not suffer any injury or smoke inhalation. Harris said: ""I first realised I needed to get out when I opened the door and the flames went up my arm. ""Sadly the car was lost and it always makes me sad to see a beautiful car destroyed."" Jordan said: ""Doing a stage of the Monte Carlo Rally was a dream come true for me. The car was stunning - so light on its toes. ""It was dancing around the mountain and Chris was driving it beautifully."" He added: ""It's such a shame we didn't finish the test, but these things happen."" A spokesman for the BBC Two show said: ""There was an incident during filming in Monaco last Monday morning with an Alpine that led to a fire taking hold of the main vehicle - which Alpine is now investigating.

His visit comes at the start of a week of crucial negotiations within the EU and the Cabinet, and hours after Downing Street insisted Britain will ""categorically"" leave the customs union. Seeking to calm the fears of some backbench critics who have accused Chancellor Philip Hammond of trying to pursue his own policy aimed at keeping Britain as closely aligned as possible with the EU, a No 10 source said last night: ""It is not our policy to be in the customs union."" The source said they would be seeking an ""arrangement"" with the EU to ensure trade remained as ""frictionless"" as possible after Brexit. Reacting to the confirmation, Mr Barnier said earlier: ""We know the line of the Government... We have to respect the red lines of the British Government - but they have to respect the rules of the Union."" :: Mixed messages from May and Fox on customs union after Brexit Officials are preparing to open negotiations on transitional arrangements. Today's talks in Downing Street will mark the first time Mr Bariner, Mrs May and Mr Davis have met since EU leaders gave the green light for the second phase of negotiations to start at their December summit in the Belgian capital. Fresh tensions have emerged after the European side insisted that EU law must continue to apply in the UK throughout the post-Brexit transition period - expected to last about two years. Mrs May has already made clear that she intends to push back against the bloc's demands that EU citizens who come to the UK during the transition should enjoy the same rights as those who come before Britain leaves the EU on 29 March 2019. Ministers have said the demand goes beyond what was agreed at the December summit but senior EU figures insist it is ""not negotiable"". :: Customs union and other Brexit terms explained The meeting will be followed on Tuesday by the first technical discussions by UK and EU officials in Brussels on the transition arrangements, which are intended to ensure businesses and citizens are not faced with a ""cliff-edge"" break when Britain leaves the bloc. Meanwhile, senior ministers are also preparing for the first discussions on Britain's future relationship with the EU by Mrs May's so-called ""Brexit war Cabinet"". Members of the Cabinet Brexit sub-committee will meet on Wednesday and then again on Thursday as they seek to thrash out an agreement on thorny issues such as customs arrangements with the remaining EU27. The subject is so sensitive that the Prime Minister has previously declined to authorise any formal discussion in the group. On Sunday, Home Secretary Amber Rudd brushed aside warnings from hardline Brexiteers that Mrs May could face a leadership challenge if she fails to deliver a ""clean Brexit"". Ms Rudd said ministers would not be intimidated and insisted that there was greater agreement around the Cabinet table than MPs sometimes realised."

The assessment suggested the options for a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU would all leave Britain worse off. Mr Rees-Mogg had earlier said that the Treasury's economic modelling was ""clearly politically influenced"" and that they were ""fiddling the figures"" in the report. On Saturday afternoon, he told Sky News: ""With these forecasts it all depends on the information you put in in the first place. ""They put in assumptions that lead to their conclusions, so they are determined by the measures they put in, and those measures, I think, are fundamentally wrong. ""But you need to remember that (former chancellor) George Osborne thought the Treasury used to fiddle the figures. ""That's why he set up the Office for Budget Responsibility - because he felt that the Treasury under Gordon Brown's chancellorship and prime ministership just invented the forecasts to meet the political needs of their political masters. ""I'm afraid I think the same thing is happening again. ""This isn't new, it's fairly traditional."" Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA - the union which represents civil service leaders - called Mr Rees-Mogg's claims ""reckless"", and said the Brexiteer was ""incapable of understanding how the civil service works, because he has no sense of public service"". Mr Penman went on: ""He can't understand that civil servants can put aside their political beliefs to act in the public interest. ""Basically, he's got to put up or shut up. If he's going to make these sort of accusations against the civil service, he's got to produce some evidence. And it's about time the Prime Minister and ministers in the Cabinet came out and defended the civil service, too."" A Treasury spokesman said: ""Both Treasury ministers and officials are working hard to deliver the best Brexit deal for Britain. ""The Prime Minister and the Chancellor have said repeatedly that we will be leaving both the single market and the customs union. ""Any suggestion to the contrary is simply false."" Mr Rees-Mogg has said that any deal that keeps the UK in a common customs area with the European Union would be unacceptable and that this would prevent the UK from striking free trade deals with other countries. His words came after Prime Minister Theresa May, on her final day of a visit to China, appeared to leave open the possibility of some sort of customs arrangement with the EU."

The Prime Minister will pay tribute to those who braved ""open hostility and abuse to win their right"". And she will warn: ""In the 21st Century it cannot be acceptable for any woman - or any person - to have to face threats and intimidation simply because she or he has dared to express a political opinion. Her speech comes after her own backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg had to face down aggressive protesters who tried to violently disrupt a public event in Bristol. :: Rees-Mogg caught up in fracas as protesters disrupt university event Last year, Mrs May launched an investigation after MPs and candidates in the General Election complained of death threats and other forms of intimidation. The report, published last December, warned women, ethnic minority and gay candidates were more likely to suffer abuse. In that same month, the PM addressed the commons after Tory MPs who supported an amendment to the Brexit withdrawal bill received death threats. When Sky News confronted some of those online ""trolls"" they were reluctant to admit any wrongdoing. :: Sky News confronts trolls who targeted Tory MP Anna Soubry over Brexit The Prime Minister will say: ""In public life, and increasingly in private conversations too, it is becoming harder and harder to conduct any political discussion, on any issue, without it descending into tribalism and rancour. ""Social media and digital forms of communication - which in themselves can and should be forces for good in our democracy - are being exploited and abused, often anonymously. ""British democracy has always been robust and oppositional but a line is crossed when disagreement mutates into intimidation. ""When putting across your point of view becomes trying to exclude and intimidate those with whom you disagree."" The Prime Minister will add: ""It is time we asked ourselves seriously whether we really want it to be like this. Whether we are prepared to accept a permanent coarsening and toxifying of our public debate or whether, together, we will take a stand for decency, tolerance and respect."" :: The Suffragettes: The women who risked all to get the vote Mrs May will set out Government plans to crack down on intimidation on the campaign trail. A consultation will be launched on a new offence in electoral law of intimidating parliamentary candidates and their campaigners. The current offence of electoral intimidation relates to undue influence on voters. And legislation will be brought forward to remove the requirement for candidates standing as councillors in local elections to have their addresses published on ballot papers. The move would bring local elections in line with UK parliamentary elections where candidates have not been forced to include home addresses on ballot papers since May 2010."
2018-02-04,"Those few people who claim that the suffragettes were terrorists are misguided and sensationalist, June Purvis, women's history professor writes.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180205073704/https://news.sky.com/story/suffragettes-were-inspirational-not-terrorists-11237317,"They are simply seeking to condemn these radical women who were campaigning for their democratic right to the parliamentary vote. Although there is no one accepted definition of terrorism a key aspect is the intention to harm or take life, particularly of innocent civilians. If Emmeline Pankhurst, the inspirational leader of the suffragettes were alive today, she would be horrified by the actions of the present-day suicide bombers who ruthlessly kill and injure at random, women, men and children going about their daily lives. The suffragettes did not kill or harm anyone. Throughout the suffrage campaign, Emmeline Pankhurst emphasised that human life should not be endangered. As late as 1975, the former suffragette Mary Leigh, then in her nineties, recollected: ""Mrs Pankhurst gave us strict orders… there was not a cat or a canary to be killed: no life."" The suffragettes were members of the Women’s Social and Political Union (WSPU), founded by Emmeline Pankhurst, her eldest daughter Christabel and some local socialist women in 1903, in Manchester. :: I'm glad history is finally recognising my Suffragette great-great-grandmother This new organisation, which was for women only, was to campaign for the parliamentary vote for women on the same terms as men. It aimed to attract women of all social classes and political affiliations, and to unite them under the slogan, Deeds, not words. In its early years, the WSPU engaged in peaceful protest that did not catch the attention of an all-male parliament, nor the press. Christabel Pankhurst, the WSPU’s brilliant key strategist, decided that more confrontational tactics were necessary. On 13 October 1905, she and Annie Kenney were arrested after they shouted out a question about votes for women at a Liberal Party meeting in the Free Trade Hall in Manchester. In court the next day the two women, as planned, chose imprisonment rather than pay a fine for their ""unruly"" conduct. Although the newspapers of the day condemned their ""unladylike"" behaviour, the stunt worked in that many more women flocked to join the WSPU. From now on, heckling of MPs and a willingness to go to prison became common suffragette tactics. With their cry of ""Rise Up Women!"" the charismatic Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst, both powerful orators, roused thousands of women to demand, rather than ask nicely, for their democratic right. However, successive deputations to Parliament and imaginative stunts to support their cause – such as chaining themselves to the railings of No 10 – had no effect. Herbert Asquith, the Liberal prime pinister for most of the campaign, was a fervent opponent of votes for women. :: The women who risked all to get the vote :: Opinion: 'Suffragettes were terrorists who planted bombs' By 1912, the suffragettes were banned from attending Liberal Party meetings and banned from holding their own. Denied legitimate means of protest, a minority of the women engaged in damage to private and public property – mass window smashing, firing empty buildings or destroying mail in postboxes. But such violent, unlawful acts of vandalism were not terrorism. Nor did the Liberal Government denigrate the WSPU as a terrorist organisations or prosecute militant suffragettes as terrorists. We must also remember why some of the suffragettes turned to these more violent tactics and discuss state violence against the women. Even when campaigning peacefully before 1912 the suffragettes could be roughly handled by the police, or forcibly fed if they went on hunger strike. Forcible feeding was a brutal, life-threatening and degrading procedure, performed by male doctors on struggling female bodies. Many of the women spoke of it as a form of instrumental rape. Some would be fed 242 times. The violence inflicted on the suffragettes by the police on 10 November 1910, when another peaceful deputation tried to reach parliament, had been a turning point. The women were treated with exceptional brutality, many of the assaults being sexual in nature. Legs were kicked, arms twisted, breasts pinched, knees thrust between legs. This state-inflicted violence on Black Friday, as the day became known, was frequently cited as the reason the more extreme forms of vandalism suffragettes engaged in from 1912. What was the point of women’s bodies being battered and assaulted in their just demand for the vote if damage to property brought about a quicker arrest? Far from being terrorists, the suffragettes played a critical part in the passing of the 1918 Representation of the People Act which granted the parliamentary vote to all women graduates and certain categories of women aged 30 and over. Their contribution to the making of our modern democracy must not be written out of history. :: June Purvis is Emeritus Professor of Women’s & Gender History at the University of Portsmouth. She has written many articles and books on the women’s suffrage movement including Emmeline Pankhurst: a biography and Christabel Pankhurst a biography."

Worboys' return to HMP Wakefield emerged as a lawyer said she had passed details of fresh allegations made by five women to police.

The Cabinet minister also dismissed recent claims by some of her party colleagues that civil servants, working under Chancellor Philip Hammond at the Treasury, are agitating for Britain to retain close ties with the EU beyond 2019. It follows a Sunday Times report that Brexit-backing Conservatives are plotting to install a ""dream team"" of Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and Jacob Rees-Mogg in power if Theresa May attempts to keep the UK in a customs union with the EU. Dubbed the ""three Brexiteers"", they would take on the roles, respectively, of Prime Minister, deputy Prime Minister, and Chancellor, according to the newspaper's report of the planned coup. Posting on Twitter, veteran Remain-supporting Tory MP Sir Nicholas Soames branded suggestions the trio could assume positions at the top of Government as ""absolute b******s"". A sub-committee of top Cabinet ministers will meet on Wednesday and Thursday this week to thrash out an agreement on the UK's negotiating stance before the next round of Brexit talks with the EU, on a transitional deal and a future trade agreement. One of the key issues to be decided by ministers will be whether or not to retain customs arrangements with the EU after Brexit, which could hinder the ability of the UK to sign future trade deals with non-EU countries beyond 2019. Ahead of those meetings, Ms Rudd told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""I have a surprise for the Brexiteers, which is the committee that meets in order to help make these decisions is more united than they think. ""We meet in the committee. We meet privately for discussions. I think that we will arrive at something which suits us all. ""There will be choices to be made within that, but we all want the same thing which is to arrive at a deal which works for the UK."" Ms Rudd insisted she is ""not intimidated at all"" by those wanting the UK to steer clear of any form of customs union with the EU after Brexit, while she refused to comment on suggestions Mr Johnson is being encouraged to offer her the role of Chancellor in a future government, should he reach Number 10. The Home Secretary also told Mr Rees-Mogg he was ""wrong"" to accuse Treasury officials of ""fiddling the figures"" in their Brexit forecasts, as he expressed his belief Mr Hammond's department is determined to keep the UK in the EU's customs union. Housing minister Dominic Raab also rebuked his fellow Leave supporter Mr Rees-Mogg, who is the favourite to replace Mrs May as Tory leader among Conservative members. Speaking to Sky News' Sunday with Niall Paterson show, Mr Raab admitted there are ""inherent tensions in dealing with Brexit because different people take different views"" within Government. But he ruled out Britain remaining in ""any form"" of customs union with the EU after Brexit, adding: ""If we were, we would have our hands tied in negotiating free trade deals with other parts of the world."" Offering his full backing to the Prime Minister, Mr Raab suggested Tory MPs should display ""a team effort, a bit of discipline… [and] a bit of emotional intelligence"" in order to focus on the ""prize"" of a Brexit deal. Remain supporter Sarah Wollaston also used an appearance on the programme to warn Conservative colleagues off their ""manoeuvres"" against Mrs May. ""Undermining her leadership at such a crucial point in our negotiations is, I think, deeply unhelpful,"" she said. ""So I wish those Cabinet ministers that were out on manoeuvres would just row back, because what we need to be presenting is a united front."" Amid the continuing splits in the Conservative Party over Brexit, senior MP Bernard Jenkin used a Sunday Telegraph article to suggest ""vague"" and ""divided"" ministers had made life ""impossible"" for civil servants. He wrote: ""If the Prime Minister sticks to one policy and the Chancellor keeps advocating another, what are officials meant to do?"" Urging Mrs May to back a ""clean Brexit"", Mr Jenkin warned: ""She can only command a majority in Parliament on her present policy"". The Prime Minister has repeatedly stated the UK will be leaving the EU's single market and customs union after Brexit. Responding to the recent attacks on civil servants by Leave-supporting MPs, former head of the civil service Lord Turnbull accused Brexiteers of employing tactics similar to those adopted by German nationalists in the 1930s. The crossbench peer told the Observer: ""They are losing the argument in the sense that they are unable to make their extravagant promises stack up, and so they turn and say: 'Things would be OK if the civil service weren't obstructing us'."" Another former top Whitehall mandarin, Lord O'Donnell, accused Leave-supporting politicians of ""selling snake oil""."

One of her descendants, Kate Barratt, tells Sky News she is glad that history is finally recognising her great-great grandmother.Suffragettes were not upper class feminists with time on their hands, but fearless mavericks who brought together women (and men) from all economic and social backgrounds. One of those women was my great-great grandmother, Leicester Suffragette leader, Alice Hawkins. Alice used to say ""you must use your vote, we suffered for it"". She was a working class mother of six and wife to Alfred - her biggest supporters - and a force to be reckoned with. Not afraid of fighting the hard fight, she knew that votes for women meant the route to better pay and working conditions for all working women, who often did the same jobs as the men. The Pankhurst family, Emily, Sylvia, Christobel and Adele, were very charismatic leaders of the movement and knew how to court the media with high-profile campaigns of the day. Alice, on the other hand, represents the rank and file working class who worked long hours in the factories yet found the strength and resolve to campaign against the women's injustice. The Pankhurst sisters gave Alice strong and continued support in forming and running the Leicester branch of the Suffragette movement, and we have the letters to Alice from Emily Pankhurst to prove it. After all, there were many women just like Alice in the movement, but only the Pankhursts lead it. Answering a small newspaper feature in the early 1990s, my late grandmother contacted a mature student at Leicester University, Dr Richard Whitmore, who was studying the Suffragette movement in the city and whose thesis proved to be a goldmine of information. Together with the family's stories of Alice and her original suffrage memorabilia, the full and detailed story of Alice Hawkins' campaign for the vote could finally be told. Since then my dad, Peter Barratt, has shared the story of Alice's struggle to many interest groups, raising Alice's profile in Leicester and beyond. In 2013 dad spoke with the Leicester council about designing and erecting a statue of Alice in Leicester city centre's market place to represent the 'good fight' the women put up, against all odds. Even Ramsey MacDonald, Alice's local MP, could not escape her vexing persistence and the two exchanged many heated letters on the topic. Alice's husband Alfred was another force to be reckoned with. At public meetings, he heckled Winston Churchill on the matter with the aim of shaking up the establishment who wanted the women to simply 'go away'. Fast forward to 2012, my family realised that Alice did not even have a headstone on her grave. She was the last of six to be buried in the plot (known as a 'pauper's grave') so we held a small event to commemorate her and erected a headstone in her memory. And now this year, a statue of her will represent all the women, men and ethnic minorities who endured much pain and suffering to gain the rights we have today. I'll use this event to celebrate Alice's feisty approach to life, fighting for what she believed in and never taking 'no' for an answer. Often we say that we ""don't have time"" to do the simplest things. Whether it's committing a few hours a month to charitable work, talking to a lonely elder, or even just putting down our phones to acknowledge people face-to-face. But despite working long hours in factories, Alice made time to right the wrongs that she felt passionate about, and to travel all over the UK doing it. I would encourage you to use your vote at all elections - it's a privilege. And if you don't like the policies that politicians present today, then make time to create your own."

2018-02-05,Theresa May will announce a crackdown on social media abuse - amid concerns the coarsening of political debate is deterring women from entering public life.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180206111336/https://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-to-announce-crackdown-on-social-media-abuse-11238419,"In a speech to mark the centenary of women's right to vote on Tuesday, Britain's second female Prime Minister will praise the ""heroism"" of suffragettes as she outlines proposals to deal with online ""bitterness and aggression"". A record number of women were elected to Parliament in last June's snap General Election. But there is growing concern among political parties and MPs that increasing misogyny on social media will deter women from standing for election. Speaking in Manchester, Mrs May will say: ""While there is much to celebrate, I worry that our public debate is coarsening. ""That for some it is harder to disagree, without also demeaning opposing viewpoints in the process."" The Prime Minister will say online abuse is often targeted at women, gay people and members of ethnic minorities, as she urges social media companies to do more to stamp out abuse. Mrs May will announce a series of measures to try to tackle online aggression: a new annual internet safety transparency report will provide data on how social media companies are dealing with abusive material. The Prime Minister will also introduce a social media code of practice later this year. And she will endorse the recommendations of a House Commons' report into intimidation, which called for legislation to shift the balance of liability for illegal content to the social media companies. In addition, Mrs May will ask the Law Commission to review legislation to ensure actions classed as illegal offline are also illegal online, in an attempt to better police the internet ""In the face of what is a threat to our democracy, I believe that all of us - individuals, governments, and media old and new - must accept our responsibility to help sustain a genuinely pluralist public debate for the future,"" the Prime Minister will add. Her speech will mark the 1918 Representation of the People Act, which granted the vote to many women aged over 30. A century later and women now make up 32% of all MPs. Nearly 45% of the Labour benches are made up of women, boosted by the party's policy of all-women shortlists. The Tories are lagging behind: just over one-in-five of their MPs are women. But Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis told Sky News the party would not be introducing all-women shortlists to get more women on the Conservative benches. Instead, the party is appointing a vice-chair of candidates - Maria Caulfield MP - to encourage more women to stand. ""We are working to change the culture across politics through cracking down on abuse and intimidation,"" said Ms Caulfield. ""Gender quotas and shortlists are short term fixes, which do not address the underlying problems we are tackling."" Nicky Morgan, the former education secretary and equalities minister, said she too was now ambivalent about all-women shortlists, having given them conditional backing ahead of the 2015 General Election. ""We had this thing about all-women shortlists in the Labour Party and then I watched misogynistic abuse that Liz Kendall and Yvette Cooper got when they stood for the leader of the Labour Party,"" she told Sky News. ""You have these shortlists and they've had them for at least 20 years. ""But, if you actually look at the Labour Party and the way those particular females candidates got trashed by their own members, actually what those all-women shortlists didn't do was change the culture."" Harriet Harman, former deputy Labour leader and the longest-serving female MP in the House of Commons, admits there has been resistance to all-women shortlists but says there were necessary to change representation in Parliament. She also believes that while Labour has done the heavy lifting of getting women into Parliament, it is Mrs May who has the power as Prime Minister to effect real change for women on equal pay, domestic violence and childcare provision. ""When I was first in Parliament in 1982, it was 97% men and 3% women,"" she told Sky News. ""That was the way it had been for the previous 50 years. ""It was almost like there was an invisible glass ceiling and we were determined and used all-women's shortlists to increase that percentage of representation and now we've got over 40%."" Ms Harman also said female politicians were more willing to work cross-party to campaign on women's issues. She said one touchstone issue would come in April, when companies employing over 250 people are forced to publish gender pay audits, which could lay bare the discrepancy in pay between men and women. Mrs May will address all female MPs past and present at a gathering in Westminster Hall later on Tuesday to launch a year-long Vote 100 programme of events to celebrate a century of female suffrage."
2018-02-05,More than 15m people have tuned in to watch two YouTubers duke it out in the UK's biggest boxing match since Anthony Joshua took on Wladimir Klitschko at Wembley last year.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180206111336/https://news.sky.com/story/millions-tune-in-to-watch-bout-between-youtubers-ksi-and-joe-weller-11238123,"KSI, real name Olajide William Olatunji, and Joe Weller went head-to-head at London's Copper Box Arena on Saturday in a clash that attracted a peak audience of 1.6m viewers. The archived broadcast has since clocked more than 15m views, with thousands of fans having paid an average ticket price of £66 to attend the bout. The pair - who have amassed more than 22m subscribers between them through vlogging and playing video games online - even managed to attract more than 13m to watch a pre-fight news conference. By comparison, Joshua's win over Klitschko in April drew in more than 1.5m Sky Box Office customers, with almost 700,000 Americans tuning in and 10m watching a free broadcast in Germany. KSI and Weller started planning the fight last year when a feud over their online popularity started to heat up, with insults exchanged over Twitter and in YouTube comments. Weller, 21, had gone into the bout confident after beating another online personality - Theo Baker - in a live-streamed match in August, but it proved a comfortable victory for KSI. The match was stopped in the third round after a standing count against a seemingly nervous Weller, who took more than 30 seconds to throw a punch in the first round, and KSI was presented with the winner's belt by former professional heavyweight Derek Chisora. ""@KSIOlajidebt was the deserved winner and I wanna congratulate him and his team on the success,"" a bruised Weller tweeted after the match. ""Thank you to everyone that has shown support throughout this journey. I will learn a lot from this and am looking forward to my next challenge."" KSI, 23, has now turned his attention to controversial US YouTuber Logan Paul and his brother Jake, but the pair have dismissed the challenge, describing the Watford-born entertainer as ""irrelevant"". Logan Paul - who has more than 16.5m subscribers - drew widespread condemnation last month for posting a video in which he showed a body he found in a forest known for suicides while filming in Japan. He apologised, claiming the video had been an attempt to raise awareness of mental health issues."
2018-02-05,"The EU's chief Brexit negotiator has warned Britain ""the time has come to make a choice"" as he warned of ""unavoidable"" trade barriers.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180206111336/https://news.sky.com/story/michel-barnier-warns-uk-time-has-come-to-make-a-choice-on-brexit-11237999,"In a visit to Downing Street on Monday, Michel Barnier outlined a robust stance over the impact on trade in goods and services if the UK leaves the single market and customs union. It follows a recent bout of infighting within the Conservative Party over whether or not Britain should retain a customs union with the EU beyond 2019. Tory Brexiteers have expressed fears remaining in a customs union with the EU after Brexit will hinder the UK's ability to sign independent trade deals with countries outside the bloc. But pro-Remain Conservatives have cautioned the ""only way"" to achieve the Prime Minister's aim of ""frictionless"" trade between the UK and the EU is to remain in the customs union. Speaking alongside Brexit Secretary David Davis in Number 10, Mr Barnier said: ""We need clarity about the UK proposals for the future partnership. ""The only thing I can say, without a customs union and outside the single market, barriers to trade in goods and services are unavoidable. ""The time has come to make a choice."" Mr Barnier also held a 20-minute meeting with the Prime Minister on Monday, before his lunch with Mr Davis. On Wednesday and Thursday, Theresa May will chair two meetings of a key Cabinet sub-committee to thrash out the UK's approach to the next phase of Brexit negotiations. Asked whether the Conservative Party will ever agree on an approach to Brexit, Mr Davis insisted the Government's ambition was ""perfectly clear"". ""We've said in terms we want a comprehensive free trade agreement and with it a customs agreement,"" he said. ""And to make that as frictionless as possible. To make as much trade that currently exists as free as possible whilst still giving ourselves the opportunity to make free trade deals with the rest of the world."" Mr Davis earlier stressed a ""time-limited"" transition period after 2019 would ""lead to us being outside the customs union and indeed the single market in the longer term"". The Brexit Secretary hailed Monday's ""very constructive conversations"" and revealed UK and EU officials will begin ""intensive"" talks on agreeing the terms of a transition deal from Tuesday. Mr Davis said he was ""confident"" such an agreement will be struck by the time of the European Council summit in March. Declaring the EU will ""not give a running commentary"" on Britain's domestic debates over Brexit, Mr Barnier expressed his hope the UK Government will ""clarify"" it's position on a future UK-EU relationship ""in the next few weeks"". The European Commission official claimed there is still ""some work to do"" on finalising the UK's ""orderly withdrawal"" from the EU, on which a draft agreement was agreed before Christmas to allow Britain to move on to talks about a transition period and a future trade deal. In response to Mr Barnier's warning of post-Brexit trade barriers, the Prime Minister's official spokesman said: ""We have said that we want the customs arrangement to be as frictionless as possible and that's what we will be looking to achieve as part of the deep and special partnership that we are seeking with the EU. ""We want it to be as frictionless as possible and we think we can achieve that because it's in the interests of the UK and the EU. As with all these matters, it's the beginning of a negotiation."" Last week, a row broke out after leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, who leads an influential group of Tory MPs, accused the Treasury of ""fiddling the figures"" in Brexit forecasts with the aim of keeping Britain in the customs union. Mr Rees-Mogg stepped up his attack on Monday, as he appeared to blame Chancellor Philip Hammond - who has repeatedly been accused of agitating for a ""softer"" Brexit - for the ""biased"" forecasts. In the House of Lords, peers compared Brexiteers' attacks on civil servants to US President Donald Trump's ongoing feud with the FBI. Meanwhile, prominent europhile Tory MP Anna Soubry warned the ""only way"" to preserve frictionless trade with the EU is to remain in the customs union. She also used her Twitter account to ""gently remind"" her Conservative colleagues the Government had lost its majority in the House of Commons last June, which she attributed to voters having ""rejected"" a ""hard Brexit"" outside the customs union."
2018-02-05,We are witnessing the second space race.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180206111336/https://news.sky.com/story/elon-musks-falcon-heavy-is-a-space-race-game-changer-11238494,"This time it's not a cold-war battle between nations, but a commercial contest between private companies. And the stakes are about to be raised further with the launch of the Falcon Heavy, the biggest rocket since the mammoth Saturn V that took astronauts to the moon. For the space industry it's a game-changer. The maiden flight has all the panache you'd expect from SpaceX and its founder, Tesla boss Elon Musk. On board is an red electric roadster, complete with a mannequin called Starman in the driver's seat, which will be sent on a trajectory that puts it in orbit around the sun. Musk has a sense of humour as well as money. The launch leaves Blue Origin trailing in the new space race. The spaceflight company started by Amazon boss Jeff Bezos has been shuttling cargo to the International Space Station. And it hopes to fly crew to the ISS from next year. But for now it's being well beaten. The third contender in the race is Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic. Forced to redesign its spacecraft after a fatal accident, it's still a long way off commercial flights. SpaceX has been in the lead for some time. The first commercial flight to the ISS, and the first to re-use the first stage of a rocket that had already delivered a payload to orbit. A successful test flight for the Falcon Heavy will see SpaceX chalk up another first: all three cores, with their massive engines, will attempt to touchdown on separate landing pads for use in a future launch. It's the reusability of the Falcon Heavy that makes it so attractive for commercial flights, keeping the cost of a launch down to a mere $90 million (£64 million). The next most powerful rocket, the Delta IV Heavy, can put about half as much in orbit for four times the price. With the money companies save on launching their cargo on a Falcon Heavy they could buy another satellite. No surprise then that the SpaceX rocket has been booked to launch several large communications satellites and a test payload for US Air Force. More orders will doubtless follow. But Elon Musk wants to go further. By the end of the year he wants to send two paying passengers around the moon. Competition is leading to innovation. That's what's needed to take humans to Mars. The space race is picking up speed. And it's getting exciting."
2018-02-05,"Suffragettes used a wide variety of methods to force politicians to embrace their cause of votes for women, including arson attacks on post boxes and bombing the chancellor's house.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180206111336/https://news.sky.com/story/women-would-have-got-the-vote-earlier-if-not-for-suffragette-terrorists-11227772,"Here, two historians say whether they should be judged today as terrorists. Suffragettes are seen as selfless today but in the early 1900s they were regarded as terrorists, historian Simon Webb writes. Even the mildest criticism of the suffragettes makes many people feel uneasy. The image which we have of them today is that of selfless and patient women, enduring imprisonment, hunger strikes and the horror of force-feeding in pursuit of what was surely a just cause - that of equality of rights between men and women. Their weapons were, we have been led to suppose, those of passive resistance and peaceful protest, rather than violence against others. The worst they might have done is break windows or chain themselves to railings. This popular perception is quite false; the suffragette movement was actually a terrorist organisation. In the years leading up to the First World War, the suffragettes conducted a ferocious and prolonged bombing campaign across the whole of the United Kingdom; planting improvised explosive devices (or IEDs) in places as varied as Westminster Abbey, St Paul's Cathedral, the Bank of England, the National Gallery, railway stations and many other locations. :: The women who risked all to get the vote The first terrorist bomb to explode in Ireland in the 20th century was planted not by the IRA, but by the suffragettes. They also invented the letter bomb; designed to maim or kill those with whom they disagreed. One of the first bomb attacks carried out by the suffragettes was on the house of chancellor of the exchequer Lloyd George. It went off at a little after 6am on 19 February 1913. The bomb, which brought down ceilings and cracked walls, was planted by none other than Emily Davison, who later died beneath the hooves of the king's horse at the 1913 Derby. There is currently talk of erecting a statue of Emmeline Pankhurst near Parliament, which is a little strange when we consider how unpopular terrorists are these days. Pankhurst was the leader of the suffragette terrorists. After the explosion at Lloyd George's house, she was brought to trial at the Old Bailey for complicity in the attack and sentenced to three years imprisonment. Those planning the bombings were not lone wolves or mavericks; they were being directed and supported by the suffragette leadership. :: I'm glad history is finally recognising my suffragette great-great-grandmother The day after Mrs Pankhurst was sent to prison, a bomb was placed outside the Bank of England. Fortunately, a policeman managed to defuse it before it detonated in the crowded street. For the next 16 months, the bomb attacks came thick and fast. Some devices, such as one planted at St Paul's Cathedral on 7 May 1913, failed to explode. Others, such as the large device left at the Royal Observatory in Edinburgh a fortnight later, did go off, causing a great deal of damage. The wave of bombings led to a hardening in the government's position, as well as alienating those who supported the idea of a change in the law to allow women the vote. There had been every chance before the bombings began that a private members' bill to introduce the vote for women might succeed in getting through Parliament. But few politicians wished to be seen giving in to terrorism and, as a result, this bill failed even to gain a second reading. After the failure of the bill, it was plain that the suffragette bombers were harming the struggle for women's civil rights far more than they were aiding it. Throughout 1913 and the first half of 1914, the bomb attacks increased, striking places as diverse as Holloway Prison and the changing rooms at Cambridge University's football ground. Churches became prime targets, because of a perceived opposition of the Church of England to women's rights. Among the churches where bombs exploded were St Martin-in-the-Fields, in Trafalgar Square, Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland, famous from The Da Vinci Code, and, on 11 June 1914, Westminster Abbey; damaging the Coronation Chair. The last bomb of the campaign exploded at Christ Church Cathedral in the Irish town of Lisburn, on 1 August 1914. That same day, Germany declared war on Russia and then, two days later, on France. The First World War had begun. With the outbreak of the war, the suffragettes abandoned their activities and threw themselves into the war effort. The struggle to win the vote was forgotten in an upsurge of patriotic feeling. The terrorist bombings carried out by the suffragettes have today been almost wholly forgotten; replaced with a sanitised view of the activists as people who would do nothing more dangerous than break the occasional shop window. Far from hastening the granting of votes for women, the suffragettes impeded the political progress towards this aim by their dangerous actions, causing most people to reject them as violent fanatics. Had it not been for the bombings, there is every chance that the vote would have been given to women before, rather than after, the First World War. :: Simon Webb is the author of The Suffragette Bombers: Britain's Forgotten Terrorists. Those few people who claim the suffragettes were terrorists are misguided and sensationalist, writes women's history professor June Purvis. They are simply seeking to condemn these radical women who were campaigning for their democratic right to the parliamentary vote. Although there is no one accepted definition of terrorism, a key aspect is the intention to harm or take life, particularly of innocent civilians. If Emmeline Pankhurst, the inspirational leader of the suffragettes, were alive today, she would be horrified by the actions of the present-day suicide bombers who ruthlessly kill and injure at random, women, men and children going about their daily lives. The suffragettes did not kill or harm anyone. Throughout the suffrage campaign, Emmeline Pankhurst emphasised that human life should not be endangered. As late as 1975, the former suffragette Mary Leigh, then in her nineties, recollected: ""Mrs Pankhurst gave us strict orders… there was not a cat or a canary to be killed: no life."" The suffragettes were members of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), founded by Emmeline Pankhurst, her eldest daughter Christabel and some socialist women in Manchester in 1903. This new organisation, which was for women only, was to campaign for the parliamentary vote for women on the same terms as men. It aimed to attract women of all social classes and political affiliations, and to unite them under the slogan, 'Deeds, not words'. In its early years, the WSPU engaged in peaceful protest that did not catch the attention of an all-male parliament, nor the press. Christabel Pankhurst, the WSPU's brilliant key strategist, decided that more confrontational tactics were necessary. On 13 October 1905, she and fellow suffragette Annie Kenney were arrested after they shouted out a question about votes for women at a Liberal Party meeting at the Free Trade Hall in Manchester. In court the next day, the two women, as planned, chose imprisonment rather than pay a fine for their ""unruly"" conduct. Although the newspapers of the day condemned their ""unladylike"" behaviour, the stunt worked in that many more women flocked to join the WSPU. From then on, heckling of MPs and a willingness to go to prison became common suffragette tactics. With their cry of ""Rise Up Women!"" the charismatic Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst, both powerful orators, roused thousands of women to demand, rather than ask nicely, for their democratic right. However, successive deputations to Parliament and imaginative stunts to support their cause - such as chaining themselves to the railings of No 10 - had no effect. Herbert Asquith, the Liberal prime minister for most of the campaign, was a fervent opponent of votes for women. By 1912, the suffragettes were banned from attending Liberal Party meetings and banned from holding their own. Denied legitimate means of protest, a minority of the women engaged in damage to private and public property - mass window smashing, firing empty buildings or destroying mail in postboxes. But such violent, unlawful acts of vandalism were not terrorism. Nor did the Liberal government denigrate the WSPU as a terrorist organisation or prosecute militant suffragettes as terrorists. We must also remember why some of the suffragettes turned to these more violent tactics and discuss state violence against the women. Even when campaigning peacefully before 1912, the suffragettes could be roughly handled by the police, or forcibly fed if they went on hunger strike. Forcible feeding was a brutal, life-threatening and degrading procedure, performed by male doctors on struggling female bodies. Many of the women spoke of it as a form of instrumental rape. Some would be fed 242 times. The violence inflicted on the suffragettes by the police on 10 November 1910, when another peaceful deputation tried to reach parliament, had been a turning point. The women were treated with exceptional brutality, many of the assaults being sexual in nature. Legs were kicked, arms twisted, breasts pinched, knees thrust between legs. This state-inflicted violence on Black Friday, as the day became known, was frequently cited as the reason the more extreme forms of vandalism suffragettes engaged in from 1912. What was the point of women's bodies being battered and assaulted in their just demand for the vote if damage to property brought about a quicker arrest? Far from being terrorists, the suffragettes played a critical part in the passing of the 1918 Representation of the People Act which granted the parliamentary vote to all women graduates and certain categories of women aged 30 and over. Their contribution to the making of our modern democracy must not be written out of history. :: June Purvis is Emeritus Professor of Women's & Gender History at the University of Portsmouth. She has written many articles and books on the women's suffrage movement, including Emmeline Pankhurst: A Biography, and Christabel Pankhurst: A Biography."

Bitcoin surged in value during 2017, starting the year at around $900 and topping $20,000 in December. But it has since tumbled sharply, dipping below $8,000 on Friday amid worries about a global regulatory clampdown. In the UK, Theresa May has said Britain should take a serious look at digital currencies such as Bitcoin because of the way they can be used by criminals. Lloyds Banking Group and Virgin Money have banned customers from using credit cards to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Lloyds said it had taken action on fears that some credit card customers are gambling on making big profits and overlooking the fact they will be laden with debt if the price falls. Customers will still be able to buy digital currencies with debit cards, the banking group said. Virgin Money also confirmed it had taken the same stance. RBS, which also includes Natwest, said it kept the situation under review all the time but it was currently allowing credit card purchases along with Barclays. The move by Lloyds follows warnings by regulators and ministers in the US, South Korea, China, Russia, India, Germany and France over the market. Meanwhile, Facebook recently banned adverts for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on its sites after criticism from users about scams and hoaxes being promoted in their newsfeeds."

2018-02-05,The Government could take direct control of the East Coast Mainline as the Transport Secretary came under attack for his management of rail franchises.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180206111336/https://news.sky.com/story/government-could-take-control-of-collapsing-east-coast-mainline-11238317,"Chris Grayling informed MPs on Monday that Stagecoach, which runs the East Coast franchise with Virgin, had ""got their sums wrong"" and will suffer ""significant losses"" of nearly £200m. The Cabinet minister had previously announced the £3.3bn franchise - running between London and Edinburgh - was set to collapse, but informed the House of Commons the situation is now ""much more urgent"". ""It is now clear that this franchise will only be able to continue in its current form for a matter of a very small number of months and no more,"" said Mr Grayling. Following a breach of contract by Stagecoach, the Transport Secretary announced he will have to ""end the contract and put in place a successor arrangement"". Mr Grayling admitted his department is now considering running the East Coast line through an ""operator of last resort"", which would see the franchise return to public ownership less than three years after it was re-privatised. ""This option is very much on the table and will be selected if the assessment I have set out determines that it offers...a better deal for passengers than the alternative,"" he said. The other option the Transport Secretary outlined to MPs is for Stagecoach to continue to operate services ""under a very strictly designed short-term arrangement"". ""Given the circumstances in which this Government is having to step in to protect passengers on this line I am only prepared to consider this option on the basis that the franchise would be operated on a short-term, not-for-profit basis,"" Mr Grayling added. However, the Transport Secretary defended the continued franchising of Britain's railways to private companies and stressed ""the taxpayer has still profited financially"" from the East Coast deal, with nearly £1bn returning to the public purse. ""Passenger satisfaction is high and preparations are well under way to deliver state-of-the-art new trains on the route,"" he said. ""The problem is that Stagecoach got its numbers wrong. It overbid and is now paying a price."" Mr Grayling also insisted ""there is no question of anyone receiving a bailout"" and Stagecoach would be ""held to all of its contractual obligations in full"". Yet the Transport Secretary said, legally, Stagecoach could not be barred from bidding for current or future rail franchises. Indeed, Mr Grayling also used his statement to announce an extended contract for Virgin Trains to run services on the West Coast Mainline. In addition, it was revealed Stagecoach had been shortlisted to continue running the East Midlands franchise beyond 2019. Responding to Mr Grayling's statement, Labour's shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald attacked ""yet another monumental misjudgement to add to a growing list of miscalculations"". He told MPs: ""It is increasingly clear that he does not care about taxpayers, rail passengers or the rail industry itself, but will do everything in his power to protect and support Virgin, Stagecoach and their ilk, and the failed franchise system. ""The bailout culture at the Department for Transport is alive and well - it has never been better. ""Virgin-Stagecoach failed to deliver on its contract on the East Coast route. ""No problem - the Government will step in and bail it out, kissing goodbye to the £2bn that Virgin had previously agreed to pay. ""But, guess what? Let us just give both companies a new contract to run the West Coast line as well."" LATEST GRAYLING BAILOUTS: Despite their failure on East Coast, he has given Virgin a sweetheart deal on West Coast Main Line, without competition, & allowed Stagecoach to bid for future franchises and possibly also keep the East Coast contract as well! Yet more taxpayer bail-outs Away from the House of Commons, Labour peer Lord Adonis - who recently quit as chair of the Government's National Infrastructure Commission over Brexit - accused Mr Grayling of handing a ""sweetheart deal"" to Virgin for the West Coast franchise. He posted on Twitter: ""Cut through the waffle & yet again he is bailing out the billionaires [Virgin owner] Sir Richard Branson and [Stagecoach founder] Sir Brian Souter at the expense of the taxpayer."" Mick Cash, leader of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union, called for Mr Grayling's resignation. ""East Coast should be renationalised with immediate effect and the scale of the scandal unveiled today should mark the point at which the whole rotten business of rail privatisation in Britain was called to a halt,"" he said. ""RMT is demanding immediate assurances that the thousands of rail workers caught in the crossfire of this chaos will have their jobs and working conditions fully protected and underwritten."""

A jury at Liverpool Crown Court has already been directed by the judge to return not guilty verdicts in relation to three charges, leaving 45 (32 of indecent assault, 11 of buggery and two of attempted buggery) still to be deliberated on. The court has been told that young boys would be given free sports kit at Bennell's house and allowed to eat takeaway food. There were also arcade games and a pet monkey. During his closing speech, prosecutor Nicholas Johnson QC told the court that Bennell had described his house as a ""bit of a kids' paradise"". He added: ""The child catcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang...did it with cherry pie and lollipops. ""We suggest Mr Bennell is a child molester on an industrial scale and that's why he went to these lengths to get so many lads round to his house."" The prosecution alleges the abuse took place at Bennell's home, on tour with football teams in Wales and at the ground of Crewe Alexandra FC, where he worked as a youth coach at the time. The charges faced by 64-year-old Bennell relate to 11 complainants and are alleged to have happened between 1979 and 1990. Mr Johnson said Bennell had taken advantage of the complainants' dreams of playing football at the top level. He said: ""Many would do anything to achieve their dream. Barry Bennell knew that and he exploited that."" Mr Johnson told the jury that Bennell was ""manipulating and conniving"". ""He manipulated those boys and he is now trying to manipulate you,"" he added. Bennell, who is appearing in court via video-link due to ill health, chose not to give evidence during his trial. On Tuesday, defence barrister Eleanor Laws QC will deliver her closing speech."

New York led the downwards spiral as the Dow Jones suffered its worst daily points decline in its 122-year history, wiping out all its 2018 gains. In Hong Kong the Hang Seng Index closed down 4.9%. Sydney plummeted by 3.2% - ASX's worst day since last June. Singapore was 2.3% down, Seoul 3%, Taipei 3.7%, Manila 2.7% and Shanghai 2.1%. Wall Street investors sparked the global panic after months of surges fuelled by optimism over the US economy, corporate earnings and the global outlook. Market experts said it represented the biggest fall ever recorded in a trading session for the Dow though it later closed 1,175 points or 4.6% lower. The main S&P 500 and Nasdaq saw similar falls. Some analysts saw the declines as a return to volatility following a benign 2017. But Naeem Aslam, chief markets analyst at Thinkmarkets, believed automated trades - which kick in to reflect sharp market movements - contributed to the steepest declines. ""The regulators need to address this issue because a drop like this is worse than anything on the street, we are talking about real companies with revenue streams."" He added: ""The most interesting aspect was that we didn't see the mammoth move in gold and the reason for that is because it was the war of machines and this was not 1987- at least for now. ""The volatility index on the other hand exploded quickly and surpassed levels which we have not seen in years."" Stock exchanges in London and New York have been trading at record highs recently, helped by Donald Trump's tax cut policies and burgeoning global growth. But a key jobs report on Friday - showing strong growth in the US labour market - appears to have been the catalyst for the rally to come to a halt, at a time when some observers have suggested a so-called correction might be due. Stronger than expected wage growth in the world's biggest economy could mean sharper increases in interest rates should the US Federal Reserve feel the need to curb inflationary pressure. Those higher rates will see shares start to look less attractive compared to other investments, particularly with bonds - parcels of government debt, which are offering higher yields."

Radiologists scanning X-rays for cancer, City traders making multi-million pound transactions and police searching a crowd for a suspect's face could be the first to benefit. But Dr Davide Valeriani, a senior research officer at the University of Essex, said any task requiring prolonged concentration could be made safer and more accurate with the help of computers. ""We are doing this for human enhancement, to go beyond our limits,"" he said. ""In the future we could have sensors on our head, for instance integrated into a cap or an earphone, to track our level of concentration,"" he said. ""It could even send us feedback, telling us that we're not focused. Drivers driving many hours a day could use it to improve safety on the road."" I tried an experimental ""brain-computer interface"", or BCI, at the University of Essex. A computer monitored my brain activity through a 64-lead electroencephalography cap (EEG). By imagining certain movements with my hands and legs I was able to control an avatar in a game. No keyboard, no handheld controller, just the power of thought. If I lost focus and failed to send the right brain signals the avatar fell over. Dr Valeriani said the same technique could be used to spot the flicker of brain activity of a subconscious ""gut-feeling"". Intuition is often filtered out by more conscious logical thought, yet can be a powerful aid to decision making. ""BCIs give us the possibility of getting information that we are generally not conscious of having. ""We could tap into the brain of a person and using machine learning say, this was the gut feeling, this is what happened and then map that particular feeling with an action."" Dr Sarah Chan, a bioethics expert at the Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh, said BCIs that monitor our patterns of thought raise questions about privacy, but also our identity. ""One of the questions that brain computer interfaces are going to raise for us is this age-old problem of what it means to be human,"" she said. ""We’re human organisms, we're biological, but suddenly we're interfacing with machines, so we are, if you like, cybernetically enhanced. ""What does that mean about our ideas of human nature if we feel more like ourselves with a chip in our brain?"""

Mr Love's lawyers say US authorities have 14 days to find new points to try and appeal the ruling. Otherwise he will definitely not be extradited. In the judgment handed down by the Lord Chief Justice and Mr Justice Ouseley, it was found Mr Love's extradition would have been against his human rights. There was no reason that Mr Love, who has Asperger's syndrome, should not be prosecuted in the UK rather than the US, the judgment added. Mr Love's lawyer, Mr Edward Fitzgerald QC, told the Court of Appeal the defence was not seeking immunity from justice, but said if Mr Love was sent to the US there was a significant risk he would not be fit to be tried. ""If (Lauri Love) is dead, putting it bluntly, no victims are going to get any benefit from a trial,"" Mr Fitzgerald told the court in London. He added: ""Pragmatically, the UK is the only place where Lauri Love can be tried."" The Justices wrote the Crown Prosecution Service should now work with the authorities in the US to bring a prosecution against Mr Love in the UK. An enormous cheer went up inside the court when the verdict was handed down, prompting the Lord Chief Justice to call for calm. Outside, supporters who had hung up banners for Mr Love cheered the decision and welcomed him as he left the building. Mr Love, who has dual British and Finnish citizenship, told reporters he hoped to be able to reduce the stigma associated with depression and neurodiversity in the future. Outside court, Mr Love said: ""It was very unfortunate that the prosecution tried to paint my mental health condition as being made-up or fictitious, that contributed to the stigma (about mental health)."" Mr Love also announced his sister Natasha was having a baby today too, her water having broken late on Sunday night. Before the judgment was handed down he tweeted: ""Whatever happens today we will have something to celebrate,"" adding ""but let (us) hope and will that we have plenty to celebrate"". Emma Norton, from campaign group Liberty which intervened in the case, told Sky News: ""We are delighted that the court has today recognised Lauri's vulnerability, close family connections to the UK and the potentially catastrophic consequences of extraditing him. ""This was always a case that could have been prosecuted here and it's shameful that Lauri and his family have been put through this terrible ordeal."""

Cambridge is the first to disclose the number of reports from the system, which is now being used by other institutions. Some 119 complaints were made by students alleging sexual misconduct against other pupils. Two students made complaints against staff and seven employees complained about colleagues. The remaining complaints were not related to staff or students and some are thought to be historic. In a blog on the university's website, professor of English private law and pro-vice chancellor for education, Graham Virgo, wrote that the data ""supports our belief that we have a significant problem involving sexual misconduct"". He added: ""What we now need to ensure is that those who have been affected received the support and guidance they need. ""We expected high numbers (of reports), and view it as a metric of success. ""It appears victims have confidence in our promise that these figures will be used to judge the nature and scale of sexual misconduct affecting students and staff, and to act on it accordingly."" The University of Cambridge launched a Breaking the Silence campaign in October last year, which it said had prompted the second-largest spike in reports of sexual misconduct. Mr Virgo said: ""The early signs of the impact of Breaking the Silence are encouraging. Before the campaign, 52% of those reporting recent incidents thought nothing would be done if they made a complaint. ""Following the launch, that has dropped to 30%. Clearly, there is work still to do, but the campaign’s message that those who report will be supported and action can be taken is starting to have an impact.""

""As with all deaths in custody, there will be an independent investigation by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman,"" he added. Perkins' death comes just days after he and the other three ringleaders of the raid on the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit were told they must pay back £27.5m - based on their available assets - or serve another seven years in jail each. Last week, his lawyer said Perkins had been diagnosed with ""severe heart failure"". He said he would have to sell his £72,000 flat in Portugal, but would serve the default sentence, as he had ""no prospect of any further funds"" to pay his £6,526,571 share. The other three ringleaders - John 'Kenny' Collins, 77, Daniel Jones, 63, and Brian Reader, 78 - are also behind bars. Collins and Jones are each serving seven-year sentences, while Reader is serving six years and three months, for their roles in the raid. The gang ransacked 73 boxes at the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit, using a drill to bore a hole into the vault's wall. An estimated £13.69 million of gold, cash and gems were stolen. Although the exact value of the stolen goods has fluctuated throughout court proceedings, police have only recovered around £4.3m worth. Some £3.65m of the loot has been identified and will be returned to its rightful owners, but the rest cannot be claimed by any of the victims. Jewellery worth an estimated £690,000 will be sold off at a public auction, with the proceeds going to victims. Later this year, Perkins was due to face trial for another raid, in which £1m in goods was stolen from Chatila jewellers inOld Bond Street on the 2010 August bank holiday weekend. In April 1983, he was part of a gang of masked robbers who made off with £6m after an armed raid on the headquarters of Security Express, on Curtain Road, in Shoreditch. Perkins was jailed for 22 years in 1985 at the Old Bailey, where he was described as ""evil and ruthless""."

Some 70 short-haul flights to and from London's Heathrow Airport were cancelled on Monday and a further 10 have been cancelled on Tuesday. British Airways says adjustments are made when bad weather is expected. ""On Sunday, due to the predicted poor weather, we proactively made some adjustments to our short-haul schedules on Monday and Tuesday,"" the airline said in a statement. ""We operate around 800 flights a day, with the majority of those operating as normal. Snow was forecast for today and has also been forecast for tomorrow. When this happens, it's often necessary for us to cancel a number of flights for safety reasons. We're very sorry for the disruption to your journey. ^Charlotte ""During cold weather conditions aircraft have to be de-iced prior to departure to ensure that they are safe and additional measures are taken to ensure the safety of our operation is maintained at all times. ""We are sorry for any disruption to our customers' travel plans and will do all we can to minimise the effect the weather has on our operations."" Snow and ice is expected to grip much of the UK by Tuesday evening, having already caused chaos for drivers on Monday morning in Kent and Essex. Kent Police said the ""heavy snowfall"" had led to treacherous conditions causing several crashes on the M20. Snow and ice warnings have been issued for large parts of the country. Temperatures will fall further overnight and could dip as low as -11C in the Scottish Highlands on Wednesday night. A yellow 'be aware' warning for ice has been issued for the East Midlands, east and northeast England and Yorkshire and Humber. A snow and ice weather warning is in place for Wales, Northern Ireland, most of Scotland and northern England, beginning on Monday night from 8pm and continuing until 3pm on Tuesday. Eastern England can also expect disruption after the Met Office issued a yellow warning for snow and ice in the region. A Met Office spokesman Martin Bowles said: ""(Monday night) is going to be very cold, there is a front coming into the North West and because we have got lots of cold air there is going to be lots of snow on it. ""It is reaching north west Scotland and Northern Ireland this evening and then it will gradually work its way into north Wales and north-west England overnight, including a good chance of some fairly substantial settling of snow in those areas. ""During (Tuesday) it will continue to work its way into the South East, but as it does so it will become a much weaker affair so actually pretty much the whole country can expect to get some snow between six o'clock this evening and six o'clock tomorrow."" Sky News forecaster Chris England said overnight there ""will be a widespread sharp frost and some freezing fog in the south"". ""Northern England and Wales will see increasingly light and patchy snow clearing to central England on Tuesday morning, with a few wintry showers following."" ""Many other places will be fine, but there will be sleet and snow showers near northern and western coasts. It will stay cold."" Monday morning saw pile-ups and travel disruption due to snowfall in southeast England. Early morning commuters were caught out by heavy snowfall on a stretch of the M20 causing collisions involving several vehicles. Snow also hit parts of London and East Sussex as temperatures plummeted. Most people across the UK can expect to shiver through sub-zero temperatures at some points during the week. The cold snap is expected to grip Britain until at least next weekend, with the chance that milder weather may not arrive until the middle of the following week. Met Office forecaster Craig Snell said it would probably be ""one of our coldest weeks of this winter so far""."

Government officials should also help manufacturers license e-cigarettes as medical quitting aids, PHE recommended. They said this would allow NHS GPs to prescribe the devices to patients trying to stop smoking. The radical recommendations come following the publication of PHE's latest independent review into the evidence about e-cigarettes. Vaping only poses a fraction of the risk of smoking, experts from King's College London, the UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies, the University of Stirling and Cancer Research UK concluded. Experts estimated 20,000 smokers who take up e-cigarettes are quitting smoking each year. However, after a steep rise in usage the number of e-cigarette users has plateaued at just under three million people in the UK, according to the review. One of the reasons the numbers have stopped increasing could be due to thousands of smokers ""incorrectly"" believing vaping is as harmful as smoking. The experts found two in five smokers have not tried an e-cigarette. PHE experts, writing in The Lancet, said: ""Although not without risk, the overall risk of harm is estimated at less than 5% of that from smoking tobacco; the risk of cancer has been calculated to be less than 1%."" Martin Dockerell, tobacco control lead for PHE, said: ""We are saying no smoking anywhere on the grounds [of hospitals], no smoking in the smoking shelter - that shelter becomes a vaping shelter. ""There are two parts to being a smoke-free hospital, one is not allowing smoking on the premises, the other is helping every smoker to quit. ""Some hospitals will decide, especially with their longer-term patients or patients who don't have a choice whether they are there or not, where it will be appropriate to have spaces indoors to have spaces where vaping is permitted. ""The strongest case for that is psychiatric hospitals because [these patients] have got the highest prevalence of smoking and the highest levels of smoking related harm. ""Single occupancy rooms are quite common in mental health trusts so that makes it very easy for people to vape in a single occupancy room without any annoyance to anybody else."" With regards to regular hospitals, he said each NHS trust will make their own policy but PHE would ""certainly encourage"" at least some single occupancy rooms be available for vaping. He added: ""There is no reason why a hospital shouldn't designate some indoor areas where patients and visitors can vape."" Professor John Newton, director for health improvement at PHE, said: ""Every minute someone is admitted to hospital from smoking, with around 79,000 deaths a year in England alone. ""Our new review reinforces the finding that vaping is a fraction of the risk of smoking, at least 95% less harmful, and of negligible risk to bystanders. ""Yet over half of smokers either falsely believe that vaping is as harmful as smoking or just don't know. ""It would be tragic if thousands of smokers who could quit with the help of an e-cigarette are being put off due to false fears about their safety."""
2018-02-05,"The Suffragettes and Britain's first female MP, Nancy Astor, would demand more women in Parliament, Maria Miller writes.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180206111336/https://news.sky.com/story/parliament-should-listen-to-the-suffragettes-we-need-more-women-11238482,"We are moving forward but the struggle for women isn’t over. One hundred years ago a generation of fearless women changed our country forever by securing, the right for some women to vote. Soon after, laws were passed to allow women to stand for election and in 1919 Nancy Astor became the first woman to take her seat in the House of Commons having been elected as the Conservative Member for Plymouth Sutton. To achieve this extraordinary set of changes, members of the Suffragette movement were driven to taking direct action to have their voices heard. As punishment, some were put in prison and force fed which did little to deter their actions. Both Suffragettes and Suffragists would be rightly proud of the profound changes they achieved; but would they be proud of the rate of progress made to include women in the House of Commons today? I was elected 86 years after Nancy Astor in May 2005. In the period between my election and Nancy taking her place on the hallowed Green Benches fewer than 300 women had succeeded in bringing to life the full vision of the Suffragette and Suffragist movements. Indeed I was the 265th women to ever be elected to Westminster and today just one in three MPs is female. I am sure Nancy would be proud that it would be her party that would give the nation not just the first female Member of Parliament but also the first and second female prime ministers too. She might, however, be perplexed as to why just 489 women of any party have succeeded in being elected as MPs in the past 10 decades. The celebrations today mark the 100th anniversary of some women being given the right to vote, but this was just the start of a broader process. These activists argued that if Parliament made laws and women had to obey laws then women should be part of the process of making law too. In modern day Britain we have record numbers of women in work; women out-performing men at every level of education and more women than men are achieving the best degrees from the best universities. Why have so few of this able crowd decided to heed the calls of their campaigning sisters and turn their talents towards election to Parliament? The truth is that Parliament itself has changed little since the time of Nancy Astor. Modernisation is long overdue. When other devolved Parliaments have adopted less confrontational styles with working conditions designed to appeal to a broader cross section of society, including women, Westminster has fiercely guarded its old ways, its unwritten rules and conventions that can stand in the way of any modernising force. Professor Sarah Childs’ Good Parliament Guide has clearly set out ways to bring our House of Commons into the 21st Century. The Women and Equalities Select Committee, which I chair, has set out significant improvements that might make the House of Commons a place for more women to seek public office. And there is no shortage of goodwill from the political parties too. Indeed, when each gave evidence to the Women and Equalities Select Committee all parties agreed that Parliament would be a much better place if 50% of MPs were women. Now we need to turn these good intentions into action. As well as scrutinising laws, Members of Parliament have a duty to safeguard the health of our democracy too. If what is needed to encourage gender balance in Parliament is too slow in coming forward then MPs have a duty to follow their Suffragette sisters and take direct action to speed up the rate of change. Widespread admiration of the 50:50 Parliament #AskHerToStand campaign demonstrates the support for more women Parliamentarians. And last week, women from all parties, under the leadership of the Mother of the House, joined together to change the way the House of Commons votes, calling for an introduction of Proxy Voting for parents with new born babies and newly adopted children. So much has been achieved over the past 100 years to take forward the rights of women; being granted the vote was the start of the process. Let’s use this Centenary year to speed up the change that is needed and ensure the House of Commons really is fully representative of the nation it seeks to serve."

The gang is believed to have charged immigrants up to 10,000 euros to be hidden in trucks and brought across the English Channel. Most of the trafficked immigrants are Iraqi Kurds, mostly men but some families have also been brought into Britain. Among those arrested were two men suspected of being organisers of the gang, which has been operating in France, Belgium and Holland. More than 350 police officers were involved in the raids co-ordinated by the National Crime Agency after a year-long investigation. Investigators were also raiding car wash premises thought to have been used for laundering cash from the smuggling operation. They were also being checked by other agencies for potential immigration offences and health and safety breaches. Many of the illegal immigrants are thought to have travelled through Turkey before crossing the Mediterranean Sea, a waterway thought to have been used by a million migrants in 2015, according to the NCA. The north east gang is believed to have sent drivers to the continent to pick up the immigrants, often arranging to meet them in Belgium and Holland to avoid heavy policing at French ports such as Calais and Dunkirk. Some immigrants are simply hidden under tarpaulins in the back of lorries, others are secreted inside empty tankers. The gang is not suspected of using immigrants as slaves, poorly-paid workers or in the sex trade."
2018-02-05,I was in my early teens when I first heard about the suffragettes.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180206111336/https://news.sky.com/story/emily-wilding-davison-helped-make-me-a-feminist-11238479,"It was the eighties. Madonna was on the radio, Thatcher was in number 10, and I had a mum working full time. In my world women ran the show. To then discover that just 60 years earlier women couldn't even vote blew my mind. I was from that point onward an avowed feminist. It seemed the least I could do given that women had fought and died to give others like me the right to express ourselves democratically. The suffragette Emily Wilding Davison - who died after throwing herself under the Kings horse at the Epsom Derby - was buried in my hometown of Morpeth. She became my chosen subject when a couple of years later I was called on to give a speech about the area in which I lived. The fact no one really knew if she meant to die or just raise awareness of the cause did nothing to dim my teenage ardour. I thought she was an impossibly romantic heroine. Visiting her grave I vowed always to vote. Fast forward to 2018 and filming a piece about her impact, I found myself back at the spot I made that teenage pledge, feeling proud that I have kept it. Come rain or shine, whether in the UK or working abroad I have always managed to vote. Since having children I have dragged them along too… keen to instil in them the importance of this slightly odd act in a draughty municipal hall. To me it feels like a moral duty. :: Were the suffragettes terrorists?I know others will disagree. They are disillusioned with politics; feel the system is broken, and that their vote doesn't make a difference. I can understand their view, but it still angers me. In so many parts of the world the vote is still denied to so many. We are so lucky to be able to participate in democracy. However flawed our system may be - it is at least one we can complain about equally at the ballot box. It turns out there may have been another reason Emily Wilding Davison's story captivated me. It seems we are distantly related through marriage. My great, great, great uncle William Caisley, was also her uncle. Maureen Howes -who lives in Morpeth - is a genealogist and family historian. She was thrilled to help me piece together the family link, but is also exasperated that Emily Wilding Davison's actions have not been given greater prominence over the years. But locally the suffragette is still something of a folk hero. Visiting the King Edward IV school in the town I asked a group of sixth form girls what they knew of her. Each was clear on what she had done, and when I asked them to show if they considered themselves to be feminists, every one raised their hand. They were an articulate, bright, and confident bunch. Proud of what women before them had achieved and excited about their own futures. But many said they felt there was still a long way to go before true equality was achieved. I imagine Emily Wilding Davison would have been thrilled to hear them speak about the opportunities that lie ahead for them. She herself gained a first class honours degree in English from Oxford in 1895, but was not granted the award because at that time universities did not give degrees to women. She obviously never lived to see women vote in the UK. It was five years after she died that some women were granted the right and 15 years later that universal suffrage was declared. I have voted for many different people and parties since I earned the right to vote at 18, but whoever my cross in the box was for, it is for women like Emily Wilding Davison that I have always made my mark."
2018-02-05,Annual profits at BP have more than doubled in the space of a year - rocketing to £4.4bn in 2017 on the back of higher oil prices.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180206111336/https://news.sky.com/story/oil-giant-bp-sees-annual-profits-soar-to-44bn-11238550,"The British energy company has been buoyed by a recovery in the crude oil market, helping profits rise dramatically from the £1.9bn recorded in 2016. BP is the latest oil major to benefit from climbing prices, with Tuesday's results marking one of the strongest years in the company's recent history. Last month, Brent crude hit $70 (£50) per barrel - its highest level in more than three years. Bob Dudley, the group chief executive of BP, said: ""This has been a really, really good year and it sets us off very well to enter into 2018. ""We enter the second year of our five-year plan with real momentum, increasingly confident that we can continue to deliver growth across our business, improving cash flows and returns for shareholders out to 2021 and beyond."" BP's earnings were also given a boost after seven new projects came on line during 2017 - with oil and gas production in the fourth quarter rising by 18% to the equivalent of 2.58 million barrels of oil a day. For the full year, production costs per barrel tumbled by 16% to $7.11 (£5.09), with BP's output reaching its highest level since the year of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. The company is still suffering financial ramifications from the disaster, incurring $3.18bn (£2.28bn) of Gulf-related costs in 2017. In total, BP has now paid more than $65bn (£46.5bn) in fines and compensation to businesses. BP's fortunes and reputation were left in tatters after the explosion at the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig killed 11 men off the coast of Louisiana, causing 134 million gallons of oil to spew into Gulf waters and triggering the worst environmental catastrophe in US history. The company is not the only oil giant to defy analysts' expectations. Last week, Royal Dutch Shell announced its annual profits had surged to £8.5bn - a leap of 242% on the previous year."
2018-02-05,Uma Thurman has accused Harvey Weinstein and his film company of covering up a car crash she was injured in while filming Kill Bill.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180206111336/https://news.sky.com/story/uma-thurman-accuses-weinstein-of-kill-bill-crash-cover-up-11238478,"The actress has released a video she says is the moment she crashed after being forced to do a stunt she was not happy with. She says it took director Quentin Tarantino 15 years to pass the footage on to her, but said she did not believe he had withheld it maliciously and they were now on good terms. In the footage posted on Instagram she can be seen struggling to control the convertible Karmann Ghia before crashing into a palm tree and hitting her head on the passenger seat while filming in Mexico for the first Kill Bill movie in 2002. She is seen holding the side of her head before slumping backwards motionless then breathing heavily and rolling her head as a crew member reaches into the car and checks her pulse. Thurman called the circumstances ""negligent to the point of criminality"". The video release comes just days after she claimed she was sexually attacked by Weinstein in London's Savoy Hotel. In an earlier interview she told the New York Times she expressed concerns to director Tarantino about driving the car which she had been warned was faulty. She claims he told her: ""I promise you the car is fine. It's a straight piece of road. ""Hit 40 miles per hour or your hair won't blow the right way and I'll make you do it again."" The 47-year-old actress added: ""But that was a deathbox that I was in. The seat wasn't screwed down properly. It was a sand road and it was not a straight road."" In Monday's Instagram post she said it took her 15 years to gain the footage but did not believe Tarantino had witheld it with ""malicious intent"". She excused him, saying he remains remorseful about the incident and gave her the footage ""with full knowledge it could cause him personal harm"". The actress said she sees it as ""atoning"" for the danger he put her in. The actress said she was ""proud of him for doing the right thing"". However, she said the ""cover up after the fact is unforgiveable"", blaming ""the notorious Harvey Weinstein"", who was the producer, and raging against her agents at Creative Artists Agency (CAA) for their lack of concern. She said: ""They lied, destroyed evidence, and continue to lie about the permanent harm they caused and then chose to suppress. ""The cover up did have malicious intent, and shame on these three for all eternity. ""CAA never sent anyone to Mexico. ""I hope they look after other clients more respectfully if they in fact want to do the job for which they take money with any decency."" Weinstein has acknowledged making ""an awkward pass"" 25 years ago at Thurman after ""misreading her signals"" but a spokesman said he ""immediately apologised"". His spokesman said her claims of physical assault are ""untrue"" and Weinstein is ""saddened and puzzled"" why his ""colleague and friend"" has made these allegations now."
2018-02-05,"A white supremacist who made a series of chilling Google searches - including ""I want to go on a killing spree"" - has been convicted of plotting to carry out a machete attack on a gay pride event.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180206111336/https://news.sky.com/story/neo-nazi-guilty-of-plotting-gay-pride-machete-attack-11237807,"Armed police swooped on neo-Nazi Ethan Stables as he walked towards the New Empire pub in Barrow, Cumbria, after receiving a tip-off. Stables had posted a message on a far-right Facebook group saying he was ""going to war"" and that he planned to ""slaughter every single one of the gay b*******"". He was unarmed when he was arrested on 23 June, but subsequent police searches of his home uncovered an axe and a machete, Leeds Crown Court heard. Officers discovered he had searched the internet for how to make a bomb from matches and found a collection of cut-off match heads in his flat. He had also googled ""how to make chemical poison"", ""what is prison like for a murderer"", and bizarrely, ""do you get haircuts in prison"". Jurors were shown a video of Stables burning a rainbow flag and posing next to a swastika hanging on his bedroom wall. His mother said he became radicalised after a trip to Germany to see a young woman. Stables claimed he was ""brainwashed"" by right-wing extremists he met while living in hostels. The 20-year-old from Barrow, described as a loner by his own barrister and who has an autism spectrum condition, swapped messages with fellow extremists and blamed the fact that he was jobless on ""f****ts, n******, spastics"" and the Equalities Act. At other times, he expressed his hatred of Muslims and Jews, and claimed in a WhatsApp message: ""My country is being raped. ""I might just become a skinhead and kill people."" Jurors were told Stables was interested in the Columbine High School massacre, and had been expelled from school following an incident in which he put another pupil in a headlock. Stables claimed he was a just fantasist and was himself bisexual. He denied he was carrying out a ""recce"" of the venue when he was arrested and said he was heading out to sit outside the job centre to use the free public wifi. Stables was convicted of preparing an act of terrorism, making threats to kill and possessing explosives. He will be sentenced later."
2018-02-06,"Probation Service whistle-blowers are warning that public safety is at severe risk, because they no longer have the resources to properly supervise offenders in the community.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180207120555/https://news.sky.com/story/public-at-risk-because-of-ineffective-offender-monitoring-11239628,"Re-offending rates for some of the most serious crimes, including murder, rape and other violent offences have risen by 26% since the Government reorganised the probation system in 2014. Probation officers have told Sky News they see a direct correlation between the rise in serious re-offending and their inability to effectively monitor offenders. Under the reorganisation, the publically run National Probation Service (NPS) now deals with the most high-risk offenders, while the supervision of low and medium-risk offenders has been farmed out to 21 privately run Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs), who secured contracts worth almost £4bn over seven years. But many of the CRCs have struggled to manage their caseloads with the resources available. One whistle-blower, a probation officer with one of the CRCs, said staff numbers had been cut in half, but her caseload was as big as it ever was. ""We now have less time with our cases and rehabilitation has gone out of the window. ""We're being forced to telephone offenders because we haven't the time to meet them face to face. ""How then can you read body-language to tell if they're reoffending, whether they're back on drugs or involved in domestic abuse."" The officer said she believes the public are being put increasingly at risk. ""Our communities are not as safe as they used to be because we're not able to monitor offenders effectively anymore."" Conner Marshall, 18, from Barry in South Wales, was murdered by an offender who was under the supervision of a local probation company. David Braddon, a 26-year-old man from Caerphilly, murdered Conner while he was being monitored under a community sentence after being convicted for drugs offences and assaulting a police officer. He had missed eight probation appointments. A report by the National Offender Management Service found there were times staff could have ""monitored his community order more robustly"". Conner's mother Nadine said: ""It was just horrific to learn he (Braddon) was known and the whole case was a shambolic state. We've tried to get answers, from the authorities, but they've been continually obstructive."" Conner Marshall's death is an extreme example, but the probation officers Sky News has spoken to are firm in their belief that many others are at risk without significant reinvestment in the service. Another whistle-blower, who works for the NPS said even the publically funded national service had become increasingly dysfunctional, largely due to budget cuts. He said: ""Since the break-up of probation, the workloads for the private companies and the National Probation Service have risen exponentially. ""We've got a shortage of staff, we're not training enough new staff and that makes it very difficult for us to both protect the public and protect our staff. ""Some staff members are increasingly going off with stress related illnesses, and others are quitting altogether."" The Government is still committed to making the new probation system work and has just bailed out the struggling private sector probation companies to the tune of £340m. While acknowledging the probation system needs to improve, the Ministry of Justice said the reforms which had already been introduced had led to 40,000 previously unmonitored short-term offenders now being supervised in the community."
2018-02-06,"Theresa May's chief Brexit tormentor, Jacob Rees-Mogg, has stepped up his pressure on the Prime Minister after claims the EU plans to punish the UK during a transition period.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180207120555/https://news.sky.com/story/leaked-eu-document-shows-brexit-punishment-plan-11239487,"According to a threat contained in a leaked Brussels document, the EU wants the power to restrict the UK's access to the single market during the transition period. Brussels would do so if it feels it would take too long to launch legal action to settle a dispute. The five-page document is a draft treaty circulated in advance of EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier's whistle-stop tour of all the 27 remaining EU countries. But Mr Rees-Mogg, speaking on the eve of the first of two crucial meetings of the so-called 'Brexit war cabinet' of senior ministers, told Sky News: ""It's not something we could accept."" And Brexit campaigners claimed that if the EU refused to back down on its latest threat, then Brexit Secretary David Davis should walk away from negotiations and insist on a ""no-deal"" Brexit. Even pro-Remain MPs hit out at the proposal, with leading Labour MP Chuka Umunna claiming a transition period was beginning to look ""less like building a bridge and more like being made to walk the plank"". However, the Government dismissed the document as a ""draft"" and highlighted how Mr Davis had set out the UK's own negotiating objectives for a transition period in a recent speech. Asked about it, Business Secretary Greg Clark told Sky News: ""You shouldn't get too involved in things that happen day-to-day."" Mr Rees-Mogg, the darling of the Tory right and favourite with party activists to replace Mrs May, was speaking after a meeting of the secretive European Research Group (ERG) of hardline Brexiteer Conservative MPs. He hit out after pro-Remain Tory MP Anna Soubry threatened to quit the Tories, claimed Mrs May was ""in hock to these 35 hard Brexiteers"" led by Mr Rees-Mogg, and called for them to be ""slung out"" of the Conservative Party. Significantly, the meeting of the ERG - described as the Tories' Momentum - was attended by 33 Tory MPs and peers, close to the number suggested by Ms Soubry. Among the MPs present at the meeting, held behind closed doors, were former Cabinet ministers Iain Duncan Smith and Priti Patel, former minister John Hayes and hardline Brexiteer Andrew Bridgen. According to the Reuters news agency, the ""punishment"" plan is contained in a footnote of the legal text prepared by the European Commission on the two-year transition period after Brexit. It proposes restrictions on single market benefits as a remedy if the Commission determines it would take too long to take Britain to the EU's court to settle a dispute. ""The Governance and Dispute Settlement Part of the Withdrawal Agreement should provide for a mechanism allowing the Union to suspend certain benefits deriving for the UK from participation in the internal market where it considers that referring the matter to Court of Justice of the EU would not bring in appropriate time the necessary remedies,"" the footnote says. The draft legal text, which has yet to be approved by EU governments, will be part of the withdrawal treaty that will regulate the terms of divorce between Britain and the EU and the rules for the transition period after Brexit. The text reiterates that from 30 March 2019 to 31 December 2020, Britain would be fully bound by all EU laws but will no longer be part of the decision-making process of the EU. From 30 March 2019, the UK Parliament will no longer be considered a ""national parliament"" under EU law, nor will the Bank of England be part of the European system of central banks. It also says UK officials may, on a case-by-case basis, be invited to attend meetings in the European Parliament, European Commission or the Council of EU ministers when a British presence is necessary and in the interest of the EU, such as in the case of agreeing fishing quotas. Britain will be able to negotiate new trade deals with other countries, but cannot put them into effect during the transition period unless authorised by the EU. A spokesman for the Department for Exiting the European Union said: ""This is a draft document produced by the EU that simply reflects their stated directives. ""The Secretary of State set out the UK's position in his speech in Teesside last month. ""Together these provide a solid foundation for the negotiations on the implementation period which have begun this week with the aim of reaching agreement by March European Council."" Also condemning the leaked proposals, Jayne Adye of the Get Britain Out campaign said: ""Even before the transition period negotiations have started, the EU is plotting to inflict sanctions on Britain if we do not passively accept all EU laws imposed on us. ""The draft treaty would allow Britain to merely 'watch' the development of law, 'strictly at the EU's invitation'. This is an insult to all those who voted to leave the EU and Great Britain as a whole."" She added: ""If the EU does not drop these threats, the UK must prepare to walk away from negotiations."" Mr Umunna, a leading supporter of the pro-EU Open Britain campaign, said: ""The EU's leaked position paper underlines one thing: all the proposed transition does is push the cliff-edge out a little bit further. ""Transition increasingly looks less like building a bridge and more like being made to walk the plank. We should not leave the EU until we know where we are going."""

London Fire Brigade (LFB) evacuated eight neighbouring properties as a precaution after they were called at 9.44pm on Tuesday. A London Ambulance Service spokeswoman said: ""We were called at 9.59pm yesterday (6 February) to Holland Park Gardens, W14, to reports of a fire. ""We sent an ambulance crew, our Hazardous Area Response Team, an incident response officer and London's Air Ambulance trauma team in a car to the scene. ""Sadly, despite extensive resuscitation efforts, one patient - a man - died at the scene."" Fire crews managed to get the blaze under control after more than two hours, at 2.01am on Wednesday. Photos showed plumes of smoke streaming from the building as flames escaped from the windows. A statement from LFB said: ""Twelve fire engines and around 80 firefighters and officers were called to a fire at a house converted into flat in Holland Park Gardens in Holland Park last night. ""Part of a first floor flat was damaged by fire. A second floor flat was also damaged by fire. ""Sadly one man was pronounced dead at the scene."" Holland Park Gardens is home to multi-million pound houses in the affluent neighbourhood of Holland Park where Robbie Williams, Simon Cowell and the Beckhams all have homes. It is less than a mile from Grenfell Tower where 71 people died in June last year. The cause of Tuesday's fire is under investigation."

The billionaire, who also owns Tesla, used his own car as the test payload - with David Bowie's Space Oddity playing on lift off and a mannequin spaceman in the driver's seat. :: The Falcon Heavy is a space race game-changer View from SpaceX Launch Control. Apparently, there is a car in orbit around Earth. pic.twitter.com/QljN2VnL1O The impressive sight of the rocket's side boosters peeling away and landing upright and in unison back at Cape Canaveral came soon after launch. But the return to earth of the central booster was less successful. Mr Musk said that it had crashed into the Atlantic at 300mph, missing the floating landing platform. He said it hit the water with such force that shrapnel flew onto the droneship's deck and took out two engines. Falcon Heavy side cores have landed at SpaceX’s Landing Zones 1 and 2. pic.twitter.com/oMBqizqnpI The 70-metre Falcon Heavy is powerful enough to carry a payload of 64 metric tons - twice that of its nearest rival - and because of the reusable boosters is also far cheaper - at about $90m per launch (£64m). The next most powerful rocket, the Delta IV Heavy, can put about half as much in orbit for four times the price. It may be the most powerful rocket in existence, but it is not the most powerful ever. Saturn V, which took astronauts to the Moon, could handle more payload, as could the Soviet-era Energia. Nevertheless, the successful test looks set to pave the way for far bigger commercial satellites being put into orbit. The SpaceX rocket has already been booked to launch several large communications satellites and a test payload for US Air Force. But Elon Musk plans to go further - by the end of the year he wants to send two paying passengers around the Moon. He is not the only billionaire with space ambitions. Amazon boss Jeff Bezos also has a spaceflight company, Blue Origin, and is testing a resuable rocket to fly space tourists to the edge of space. A larger orbital rocket, New Glenn, is also in the works that will compete against the likes of SpaceX to put satellites into orbit."

Despite the fall, he says he is confident about his investment, and that he believes bitcoin's peak is still a long way off. ""I started in September 2017 with about $41,000 invested and it gradually hit almost $600,000 around Christmas, which was awesome. But now it's $160,000. ""I'm not worried about losing all my money. It won't vanish into thin air, it will have its peaks and troughs, there is going to be mass influxes and mass exoduses of money."" Bitcoin fell as low as $5,920 (£4,250) on Tuesday, according to Bitstamp Exchange, down 13% on the previous day amid worries about a global regulatory clampdown. The decline comes following a huge surge in 2017, when it started the year at about $900 (£650) and went on to top $20,000 (£14,400) in December. Alix, from London, says he is not worried. Despite having having no financial or computing background, he says he decided to invest in bitcoin last year as he started to read more and more about it in the media. ""It's crazy because it's something that I never thought I'd be involved in,"" he says. ""I first bought bitcoin when it was about $3,000 a coin. I bought about half a bitcoin to start with. Then I went on to purchase about 10 more."" Alix's app is open during our interview, and it is shocking to see the big value figure of his 'wallet' jumping around every few seconds. It jumps between $165,000 and down to $151,000 in the blink of an eye. Alix doesn't flinch. ""The money that I've earned in crypto, I've kept in crypto,"" he says. ""There is no reason for me to take it out. I have a job so this is extra money for me. I don't need this money to rely on. The advice I would give is do your research and only put in as much as you are willing to lose."" It's clear that Alix has bought into the crypto culture and is not just in it for the speculative gains. He shows me how he has spent bitcoin on various real-life products and truly thinks it's the future. There are of course many who say it is nothing but a bubble that will eventually burst, leaving many people out of pocket. Meanwhile, those on the sidelines watch the bitcoin graphs with interest."
2018-02-06,A warehouse worker has been found guilty of murdering his ex-girlfriend as she sat in her car outside a shopping centre. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180207120555/https://news.sky.com/story/man-jailed-for-vicious-murder-of-ex-girlfriend-in-shopping-centre-car-park-11238943,"Molly McLaren was stabbed to death by Joshua Stimpson two weeks after she broke up with him and just a week after she reported his behaviour to the police. The 26-year-old carried out a ""frenzied attack"" - stabbing the 23-year-old 75 times as she sat in her car outside the Dockside retail outlet in June last year. He had followed her into her gym and started working out next to her. Stimpson had admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility but was found guilty of murder by the jury, who returned a verdict in less than four hours. Sentencing Stimpson to life with a minimum term of 26 years, Judge Adele Williams warned him that he may never be released from jail. She said: ""This was a cruel, calculated and cowardly act. This was an act of wickedness. ""You took away Molly's life quite deliberately in the most vicious fashion. You were determined to punish her for ending the relationship with you. You were seeking revenge. ""I am sure you are not suffering from a personality disorder. You planned this killing. ""You are a highly dangerous young man and you will pose a very considerable risk to women for a very considerable period in the future."" Ms McLaren and Stimpson met on the dating app Tinder and dated for seven months before she ended the relationship on a night out in Maidstone. In the trial, the court heard that Stimpson had become ""desperate"" to avoid abandonment, after his mother left when he was a child. Dr Shahid Majid, a psychiatrist, told the court: ""The (feeling of) abandonment of his mother leaving was more significant than it might have been for others."" He described him as having a ""borderline personality disorder"" and said he had been referred to mental health professionals at the age of 12 when his parents split up. Dr Majid said Stimpson may have been struggling with thoughts of harming her for some time, and has an ""abnormality of mental function"". Despite this, the doctor said Stimpson's ability to understand what he was doing was not impaired, though he may not have been able to exercise self-control. Two of his ex-girlfriends previously told the court of his ""strange behaviour"" which made them feel uncomfortable. Earlier in the case, the jury heard Ms McLaren had sent a panicked text to her mother after he put his gym mat next to her at the PureGym in Dockside retail outlet. Her mother told her to leave, but shortly after she got into her car, she was attacked. He had waited in his car for her to leave, pulled up close to her, got out while the engine was running and lunged at her. One man tried to intervene, and paramedics attempted to save her life, but she suffered injuries she could not have survived. A box cutter and a pick axe were found in the car when Stimpson was arrested. Stimpson showed no emotion as the verdict was read out, but there were gasps and tears from her family in the public gallery. He did not give evidence as part of his defence. The judge commended the courage of Benjamin Morton, a passerby who tried to save Ms McLaren. Kent Police reported itself to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, now known as the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), after it emerged Stimpson had been warned twice by officers to stay away from his former partner before her death. He had posted messages to her Facebook page claiming she had been taking drugs, but when she reported the posts, nothing happened. Police warned him: ""We wouldn't want Molly to come to the police station again about you, would we?"" He replied: ""Wouldn't we?"" Two days before Ms McLaren's death, Stimpson was spoken to again. Kent Police said the matter would be investigated by the force's professional standards department and an inquiry finalised at the end of criminal proceedings. Senior investigating officer Detective Sergeant Ali Worton said: ""Molly was a popular and ambitious young woman with her whole life ahead of her but this was stolen by Stimpson in the most brutal way imaginable.

2018-02-06,The number of hedgehogs living in Britain's countryside has halved since the turn of the century.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180207120555/https://news.sky.com/story/britains-hedgehog-population-halves-since-millennium-report-finds-11239634,"Poor management of hedgerows, habitat loss and new roads and housing developments has led to the decline, the State of Britain's Hedgehogs report found. Made famous by Beatrix Potter's Mrs Tiggy-Winkle, the spiny mammals have also suffered from an increase in the use of artificial turf and concrete in gardens, removing their natural habitats. Climate change is also considered to be a contributing factor to their decline, the report by the British Hedgehog Preservation Society (BHPS) and the People's Trust for Endangered Species said. Emily Wilson, spokesperson for Hedgehog Street, a campaign run by the report's authors, said: ""There are many reasons hedgehogs are in trouble. ""The intensification of agriculture through the loss of hedgerows and permanent grasslands, increased field sizes, and the use of pesticides which reduce the amount of prey available, are all associated with the plunge in numbers of hedgehogs in rural areas."" While the story in the countryside is glum, the report found there is a more positive outlook in cities. In recent years the decline rate of hedgehogs in built-up areas has slowed down following a steep decrease of a third since 2000. Britons are being asked to leave out cat food, have wild areas in their gardens and look out for hedgehogs in distress - such as being out during the day. There is hope that when the UK leaves the European Union more cash will be given to save the country's declining wildlife populations. Ministers want the current farming subsidy system to be redesigned so farmers will not get payments depending on how much land they own but for ""public goods"" such as protecting wildlife."

But in a couple of years he'll have his own miniature horse to help him around the streets of his hometown Blackburn, in Lancashire. Digby, an eight-month-old American miniature horse, is being trained for Mr Patel by Katy Smith, from Northallerton in North Yorkshire. His training will take another couple of years but Digby will be able to help his owner in much the same way as a guide dog. ""I have always loved horses but it is good to see the benefits for people who are visually impaired,"" Mr Patel told the Lancashire Telegraph. ""He needs to get used to being out and about in Blackburn. ""I also think I will have to give myself an extra hour to try to get around my daily routine as people will all want to come and see it and touch it."" Horses have a longer lifespan than dogs, living to be between 45 and 50 years old, which some have argued makes them a more appropriate lifelong companion for blind people. Ms Smith, who runs KL Pony Therapy, said: ""You may have to have two or three guide dogs and then you have to think about the emotional bond to them. ""Another thing is that people may have an allergy, phobia or for health reasons and it is a choice for people."" She added that Digby wears nappies and is toilet trained. Mr Patel told The Guardian that despite only having met Digby once before their last training session in Blackburn, his future furry companion remembered him well. He added: ""He rubbed his neck against my leg and stood next to me, which apparently is a sign. ""I'm amazed at how good his temperament is, despite the fact he's only eight months old."""
2018-02-06,WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has lost his initial bid to have his UK arrest warrant dropped - but could still have it cancelled at another court hearing next week.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180207120555/https://news.sky.com/story/assange-loses-bid-to-have-uk-arrest-warrant-dropped-11238948,"He challenged the warrant because police in Sweden no longer want him extradited over rape allegations. However, a judge at Westminster Magistrates' Court said it remained valid because he had committed a separate offence by skipping bail in June 2012 - when he first took refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London. While the judge refused to cancel the warrant outright, she agreed to consider whether it is in the ""public interest"" to maintain it. That ruling will be made on 13 February. The judge, Emma Arbuthnot, said Assange must explain why he skipped bail - but he was not in court to do so and has not left the embassy for five and a half years for fear of arrest. Assange's lawyer, Mark Summers, replied they were ""exceptional circumstances"" in his client's case. He told the court that Assange had health problems, including depression, and that his years inside the embassy were more than adequate punishment for his bail offence. Assange - fearing extradition to the US - also had ""reasonable grounds"" to skip bail in 2012, Mr Summers added. The 46-year-old sought asylum in the embassy because he feared Swedish police would eventually send him to the US over WikiLeaks' publication of thousands of secret military documents in 2010. The site released confidential information on the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, provoking fury among US intelligence and defence chiefs. Assange's lawyers believe there is a secret US indictment that will end up with him in an American court. Another of his legal representatives, Jennifer Robinson, told reporters that Assange would face the court if he received ""an assurance that he will not be extradited to the United States to face prosecution"". The UK government has not confirmed whether an extradition request exists. Swedish prosecutors stopped investigating the rape claims against Assange last year, saying all possible leads had been ""exhausted"". In January, the Foreign Office also rejected Ecuador's request to grant him diplomatic status, which would have given Assange immunity from arrest. The South American country has already given him citizenship. For some, Assange is an activist who exposed government abuses of power and championed free speech. Others see him as a criminal who undermined the security of the West by exposing secrets. Police called off round-the-clock watch outside the embassy in October 2015 but a plan to arrest him should he leave is still in place."
2018-02-06,The Premier League is considering introducing a winter break into the English football season.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180207120555/https://news.sky.com/story/premier-league-considers-winter-break-ahead-of-new-tv-deal-11238843,"Talks have been held with the Football Association (FA) and English Football League (EFL) amid criticism from managers about fixture congestion. The move would bring English football in line with other top leagues in Europe, including Germany, France, Italy and Spain, which all have winter breaks. It is understood a break in January has been discussed which would avoid impacting England's traditional festive football schedule. Manchester City head coach Pep Guardiola recently said the number of matches over Christmas was ""going to kill"" players, while Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho claimed the lack of a winter break was hampering English clubs' chances in the Champions League. The FA has previously said a winter break is not feasible until the end of the current TV rights deal, which runs out in 2019. The proposal is reportedly referred to in tender documents sent to broadcasters ahead of the next Premier League TV rights deal covering 2019 to 2022, which is expected to be announced next week. The current £5.14bn three-year deal, which began in the 2016/17 season, sees most of the broadcast games screened by Sky, the owner of Sky News, and some by BT. A Premier League spokesman said: ""The Premier League has been in discussions with the FA and EFL for several months regarding the challenges of the increasingly congested English football calendar, and ways in which we can work together to ease fixture congestion while also giving players a mid-season break. ""Provided space can be found in the calendar, we are open to this in principle and will continue constructive discussions with our football stakeholders to seek a workable solution."""

The plans include enforcing workers' holidays and sick pay for the first time and introducing the right for all workers to request a more stable contract to provide more financial security. The gig economy describes the trend for companies to hire freelancers instead of full-time employees with people being paid for each ""gig"" they do. Business Secretary Greg Clark said: ""The Taylor Review said that the current approach to employment is successful but that we should build on that success, in preparing for future opportunities.""We want to embrace new ways of working, and to do so we will be one of the first countries to prepare our employment rules to reflect the new challenges."" Also included in the proposals: :: Defining ""working time"" for flexible workers who find jobs through apps or online so they know when they should be being paid. :: Asking the Low Pay Commission to consider higher minimum wage rates for workers on zero-hour contracts. :: Quadrupling employment tribunal fines for employers showing malice, spite or gross oversight to £20,000. Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""We recognise the world of work is changing and we have to make sure we have the right structures in place to reflect those changes, enhancing the UK's position as one of the best places in the world to do business. ""We are proud to have record levels of employment in this country but we must also ensure that workers' rights are always upheld."" But the plans have been criticised by unions, which have described them as weak. The GMB Union said the Government's plans were akin to ""trying to put out a forest fire with a water pistol"" and The TUC said the Government had taken a ""baby step, when it needed to take a giant leap"". Jason Moyer-Lee, General Secretary of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, told Sky News the Government needs to be as tough on abuse in the gig economy as it is on crime: ""These companies know they are unlawfully depriving workers of rights they're entitled to and the reason they get away with it is because there's no government enforcement. ""But for government enforcement to be effective they need to put in the resources to properly enforce the law and create a deterrent effect so these companies have an incentive to obey the law."" One Deliveroo and UberEats bicycle delivery driver - who only wanted to be named as Alan - told Sky News that although the job offers flexibility, it is time that workers were offered more protection. ""It's better people working than not working - people want to work but that doesn't mean it's a good thing that people have work without any sick pay, without any minimum wage - that's not a good thing,"" he said. Responding to the Government plans, Deliveroo said: ""The Central Arbitration Committee ruled recently that Deliveroo riders are self-employed, which gives them the flexibility they value most. 'But Deliveroo wants to go further and offer riders more security too. That's why we welcome this consultation and the chance to work with the Government to end the current legal trade off between flexibility and security."""
2018-02-06,A controversial innuendo-laden Christmas advertising campaign from Poundland has been banned.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180207120555/https://news.sky.com/story/poundlands-controversial-naughty-elf-christmas-ad-campaign-banned-11239730,"The retailer's ""Elf Behaving Badly"" campaign has been deemed irresponsible and likely to cause widespread offence by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). Poundland posted a series of images on its Twitter and Facebook pages of an elf toy in a number of sexualised poses, including playing strip poker and sitting in a tub with naked dolls. The retailer made headlines in the run-up to Christmas when tea company Twinings accused it of ""misusing"" its product after Poundland tweeted a picture of an elf dangling a Twinings teabag over a female doll, simulating a sex act. The message was accompanied by the caption: ""How do you take your tea? One lump or two?"" A later message showed the same pose but with a nondescript teabag and the caption: ""Spot the difference."" Another ad showed the toy elf playing a game of strip poker with three unclothed dolls and the message: ""Joker, joker. I really want to play poker."" A total of 85 complaints were received by the ASA, with complainants saying the ads were offensive for their depiction of toy characters and other items in sexualised manner and were unsuitable to appear where children could see them. Poundland argued the innuendos used would not have been understood by children, adding that Twitter and Facebook had policies preventing those under 13 from creating accounts. The retailer said a ""large number"" of people found the campaign funny, engaging and ""in line with what it meant to be British"", adding the intention was not to offend anyone. The campaign helped the firm achieve its most successful December since it started trading in 1990. In its ruling, the ASA noted that the campaign was based on a toy elf, which resembled the popular children's Christmas tradition known as ""Elf on the Shelf"" from the book of the same name. It said that Poundland's Facebook and Twitter pages were not age restricted and could therefore be viewed by anyone. Other images in the campaign, including a pair of breasts drawn on a car windscreen, the elf beside a drawing of a penis-shaped tree and the elf waving a vibrator, were obvious sexual references, the ASA said. The regulator said: ""We considered these ads were irresponsible and likely to cause serious or widespread offence by depicting a child's toy in relation to such sexual acts, therefore breaching the code."" Poundland has been told the ads must not appear again and that it must ensure that its advertising is presented with ""a sense of responsibility"" and in a way that ""did not cause serious or widespread offence"". In a statement on behalf of its ""naughty"" elf, Poundland said: ""Britain's the home of saucy postcards, Carry On films and panto, so I'm sad the ASA found my double entendres hard to swallow. ""At least it's only 84 people who had a sense of humour failure compared to the tens of thousands who got the joke and liked and shared my posts online."""
2018-02-06,"Suffragettes used a wide variety of methods to force politicians to embrace their cause of votes for women, including arson attacks on post boxes and bombing the chancellor's house.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180207120555/https://news.sky.com/story/women-would-have-got-the-vote-earlier-if-not-for-suffragette-terrorists-11227772,"Here, two historians say whether they should be judged today as terrorists. Suffragettes are seen as selfless today but in the early 1900s they were regarded as terrorists, historian Simon Webb writes. Even the mildest criticism of the suffragettes makes many people feel uneasy. The image which we have of them today is that of selfless and patient women, enduring imprisonment, hunger strikes and the horror of force-feeding in pursuit of what was surely a just cause - that of equality of rights between men and women. Their weapons were, we have been led to suppose, those of passive resistance and peaceful protest, rather than violence against others. The worst they might have done is break windows or chain themselves to railings. This popular perception is quite false; the suffragette movement was actually a terrorist organisation. In the years leading up to the First World War, the suffragettes conducted a ferocious and prolonged bombing campaign across the whole of the United Kingdom; planting improvised explosive devices (or IEDs) in places as varied as Westminster Abbey, St Paul's Cathedral, the Bank of England, the National Gallery, railway stations and many other locations. :: The women who risked all to get the vote The first terrorist bomb to explode in Ireland in the 20th century was planted not by the IRA, but by the suffragettes. They also invented the letter bomb; designed to maim or kill those with whom they disagreed. One of the first bomb attacks carried out by the suffragettes was on the house of chancellor of the exchequer Lloyd George. It went off at a little after 6am on 19 February 1913. The bomb, which brought down ceilings and cracked walls, was planted by none other than Emily Davison, who later died beneath the hooves of the king's horse at the 1913 Derby. There is currently talk of erecting a statue of Emmeline Pankhurst near Parliament, which is a little strange when we consider how unpopular terrorists are these days. Pankhurst was the leader of the suffragette terrorists. After the explosion at Lloyd George's house, she was brought to trial at the Old Bailey for complicity in the attack and sentenced to three years imprisonment. Those planning the bombings were not lone wolves or mavericks; they were being directed and supported by the suffragette leadership. :: I'm glad history is finally recognising my suffragette great-great-grandmother The day after Mrs Pankhurst was sent to prison, a bomb was placed outside the Bank of England. Fortunately, a policeman managed to defuse it before it detonated in the crowded street. For the next 16 months, the bomb attacks came thick and fast. Some devices, such as one planted at St Paul's Cathedral on 7 May 1913, failed to explode. Others, such as the large device left at the Royal Observatory in Edinburgh a fortnight later, did go off, causing a great deal of damage. The wave of bombings led to a hardening in the government's position, as well as alienating those who supported the idea of a change in the law to allow women the vote. There had been every chance before the bombings began that a private members' bill to introduce the vote for women might succeed in getting through Parliament. But few politicians wished to be seen giving in to terrorism and, as a result, this bill failed even to gain a second reading. After the failure of the bill, it was plain that the suffragette bombers were harming the struggle for women's civil rights far more than they were aiding it. Throughout 1913 and the first half of 1914, the bomb attacks increased, striking places as diverse as Holloway Prison and the changing rooms at Cambridge University's football ground. Churches became prime targets, because of a perceived opposition of the Church of England to women's rights. Among the churches where bombs exploded were St Martin-in-the-Fields, in Trafalgar Square, Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland, famous from The Da Vinci Code, and, on 11 June 1914, Westminster Abbey; damaging the Coronation Chair. The last bomb of the campaign exploded at Christ Church Cathedral in the Irish town of Lisburn, on 1 August 1914. That same day, Germany declared war on Russia and then, two days later, on France. The First World War had begun. With the outbreak of the war, the suffragettes abandoned their activities and threw themselves into the war effort. The struggle to win the vote was forgotten in an upsurge of patriotic feeling. The terrorist bombings carried out by the suffragettes have today been almost wholly forgotten; replaced with a sanitised view of the activists as people who would do nothing more dangerous than break the occasional shop window. Far from hastening the granting of votes for women, the suffragettes impeded the political progress towards this aim by their dangerous actions, causing most people to reject them as violent fanatics. Had it not been for the bombings, there is every chance that the vote would have been given to women before, rather than after, the First World War. :: Simon Webb is the author of The Suffragette Bombers: Britain's Forgotten Terrorists. Those few people who claim the suffragettes were terrorists are misguided and sensationalist, writes women's history professor June Purvis. They are simply seeking to condemn these radical women who were campaigning for their democratic right to the parliamentary vote. Although there is no one accepted definition of terrorism, a key aspect is the intention to harm or take life, particularly of innocent civilians. If Emmeline Pankhurst, the inspirational leader of the suffragettes, were alive today, she would be horrified by the actions of the present-day suicide bombers who ruthlessly kill and injure at random, women, men and children going about their daily lives. The suffragettes did not kill or harm anyone. Throughout the suffrage campaign, Emmeline Pankhurst emphasised that human life should not be endangered. As late as 1975, the former suffragette Mary Leigh, then in her nineties, recollected: ""Mrs Pankhurst gave us strict orders… there was not a cat or a canary to be killed: no life."" The suffragettes were members of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), founded by Emmeline Pankhurst, her eldest daughter Christabel and some socialist women in Manchester in 1903. This new organisation, which was for women only, was to campaign for the parliamentary vote for women on the same terms as men. It aimed to attract women of all social classes and political affiliations, and to unite them under the slogan, 'Deeds, not words'. In its early years, the WSPU engaged in peaceful protest that did not catch the attention of an all-male parliament, nor the press. Christabel Pankhurst, the WSPU's brilliant key strategist, decided that more confrontational tactics were necessary. On 13 October 1905, she and fellow suffragette Annie Kenney were arrested after they shouted out a question about votes for women at a Liberal Party meeting at the Free Trade Hall in Manchester. In court the next day, the two women, as planned, chose imprisonment rather than pay a fine for their ""unruly"" conduct. Although the newspapers of the day condemned their ""unladylike"" behaviour, the stunt worked in that many more women flocked to join the WSPU. From then on, heckling of MPs and a willingness to go to prison became common suffragette tactics. With their cry of ""Rise Up Women!"" the charismatic Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst, both powerful orators, roused thousands of women to demand, rather than ask nicely, for their democratic right. However, successive deputations to Parliament and imaginative stunts to support their cause - such as chaining themselves to the railings of No 10 - had no effect. Herbert Asquith, the Liberal prime minister for most of the campaign, was a fervent opponent of votes for women. By 1912, the suffragettes were banned from attending Liberal Party meetings and banned from holding their own. Denied legitimate means of protest, a minority of the women engaged in damage to private and public property - mass window smashing, firing empty buildings or destroying mail in postboxes. But such violent, unlawful acts of vandalism were not terrorism. Nor did the Liberal government denigrate the WSPU as a terrorist organisation or prosecute militant suffragettes as terrorists. We must also remember why some of the suffragettes turned to these more violent tactics and discuss state violence against the women. Even when campaigning peacefully before 1912, the suffragettes could be roughly handled by the police, or forcibly fed if they went on hunger strike. Forcible feeding was a brutal, life-threatening and degrading procedure, performed by male doctors on struggling female bodies. Many of the women spoke of it as a form of instrumental rape. Some would be fed 242 times. The violence inflicted on the suffragettes by the police on 10 November 1910, when another peaceful deputation tried to reach parliament, had been a turning point. The women were treated with exceptional brutality, many of the assaults being sexual in nature. Legs were kicked, arms twisted, breasts pinched, knees thrust between legs. This state-inflicted violence on Black Friday, as the day became known, was frequently cited as the reason the more extreme forms of vandalism suffragettes engaged in from 1912. What was the point of women's bodies being battered and assaulted in their just demand for the vote if damage to property brought about a quicker arrest? Far from being terrorists, the suffragettes played a critical part in the passing of the 1918 Representation of the People Act which granted the parliamentary vote to all women graduates and certain categories of women aged 30 and over. Their contribution to the making of our modern democracy must not be written out of history. :: June Purvis is Emeritus Professor of Women's & Gender History at the University of Portsmouth. She has written many articles and books on the women's suffrage movement, including Emmeline Pankhurst: A Biography, and Christabel Pankhurst: A Biography."

Defence Minister Oscar Aguad later said the reward could be around $4m, but the exact figure will be announced later this week. Family members pushed for Mr Macri to extend the search area and for private companies to be allowed to look for the naval vessel. The TR-1700 electric diesel submarine disappeared on 15 November while sailing ""on a routine training exercise"" off te eastern coast of Argentina. So far, 13 countries have been involved in the hunt, but to no avail. There was hope on Christmas Eve when a sonar search by the remotely operated Russian Panther Plus submarine detected a new contact in the South Atlantic. However, nothing came of it. In late November, families were told the navy had abandoned hope of finding the crew alive after the submarine captain's last message reported seawater had entered the ventilation system, causing a battery to short-circuit and start a fire. Officials also said an unusual sound was detected in the ocean near the submarine's last known position - three hours after it made its final contact. They said the noise was ""consistent with an explosion"". Previous detected contacts have been false alarms, with one coming from a sunken fishing boat. The San Juan's disappearance led to the head of Argentina's navy, Admiral Marcelo Srur, being dismissed in early December. Britain has been involved in the search, with the RAF landing an aircraft on Argentine soil for the first time since the Falklands War."

Appearing via video link from custody during a hearing at the Old Bailey in London, he pleaded guilty to having indecent images of children and possessing a paedophile manual and was sentenced to a total of 40 months in prison. James' parents, Denise Fergus and Ralph Bulger, were in court to hear Venables' latest guilty pleas. Venables admitted possessing a total of 1,170 indecent images: 392 judged to be in category A (the most serious), 148 from category B and 630 from category C. The court heard that the images officers discovered were of children mainly aged between six and 13, although some were younger. Police found a paedophile manual entitled the ""Jazz Guide"", aimed at teaching how to have sex with children ""safely"". Prosecutor Louis Mably QC told the court: ""The manual is a disgusting and sickening document which falls far below any recognisable standard of morality."" As he was being taken to a police station, the court heard that Venables admitted he had ""let people down"" and told officers he had ""stupid urges"". Mr Mably told the Old Bailey that Venables had software on his computer to browse the dark web and admitted downloading the material from there. A report had found that Venables was a ""high risk of real harm to children in the future"" and has a ""long-term and profound interest in children"", the court heard. Mitigating, Edward Fitzgerald QC said: ""He has asked me to apologise to all those he has let down. He apologises to the family of James Bulger for the renewed distress he has caused by his renewed offending."" He told the court that the ""relapse"" had been swiftly detected, adding: ""Jon Venables still has the capacity for good and a capacity to change."" It is the second time Venables has been caught with such images, having been jailed for two years in 2010 after admitting charges of downloading and distributing child abuse images. This came two years after Venables was given a formal warning by the probation service when he was arrested on suspicion of affray following a drunken brawl. Later that same year he was cautioned for possession of cocaine after he was found with a small quantity of the class A drug. Venables and his classmate Robert Thompson abducted, tortured and killed James in Bootle, Merseyside in 1993. They were both aged 10 when they killed the toddler in a crime that shocked the country due to its barbarity. The pair were given lifelong anonymity with new identities when they were freed on licence. More follows..."

One superfan from Canada shared a post on Facebook complaining about having spent nearly £6,000 travelling around to axed shows and never managing to see her live. ""I'm already maxed out on steroids and aids for my voice,"" the singer said at the time. ""I've considered doing Saturday night's show but it's highly unlikely I'd even make it through the set and I simply can't crumble in front of you all and walk out on you in that way."" In May, it was confirmed Adele is the richest musician under 30 in Britain and Ireland, having raised her personal wealth by nearly 50% last year. According to The Times, the 29-year-old is also the 19th richest in the overall Music Millionaires list, topped by Sir Paul McCartney and his wife Nancy Shevell."

If concluded, the acquisition would see the firm take control of James Villa Holidays and Cottages.com, as well as the more prominently marketed Hoseasons. In total, the UK operations offer vacations at more than 30,000 holiday properties around the country. The wider European business markets homes in countries including Croatia, Greece and Italy. Wyndham, the hotel giant behind the Ramada chain, has been looking for a buyer for the European division for several months. Platinum, which owns businesses such as the British outdoor advertising group Exterion Media, ‎is said to have seen off a rival bid for the Wyndham assets from CVC Capital Partners. Blackstone, another private equity firm which looked at the deal, did not submit a final bid, according to sources close to the auction. Banking sources cautioned‎ that a deal with Platinum had yet to be concluded and that the talks could still fall apart, although a deal could yet be signed in the coming days. Airbnb was reported to be the leading bidder for the Wyndham brands, but has not been involved in the process for some time. Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs are handling the sale process. Neither Platinum and Wyndham could be reached for comment, while CVC declined to comment‎."

Nicknamed Cheddar Man, the young man's skeleton was found in 1903 in Gough's Cave in Somerset. But while initial reconstructions portrayed him with light skin and brown eyes, the full DNA analysis has shown him to have ""dark to black skin"". Research by the Natural History Museum and University College London (UCL) suggests that the light skin tone associated with northern European ancestry actually developed later in evolution. A ""Western Hunter-Gatherer"" hailing from Spain, Hungary and Luxembourg, one in ten British people today will share Cheddar Man's genes. His ancestors had originally migrated to Europe from the Middle East. His arrival marked the start of continuous population in Britain, with previous populations having been wiped out before him. The oldest complete skeleton in Britain, the fact he was found in a cave - which was a cool, dry and consistent environment - helped preserve his remains. Research suggests he had a good diet and died in his twenties. DNA data used to rebuild his face was extracted by drilling a 2mm hole through the skull's inner ear bone. ""Paleo artists"" - twins Alfons and Adrie Kennis - then spent three months building a 3D model using a high-tech scanner. Calling the DNA findings ""revolutionary"", Alfons Kennis said: ""People will be surprised...and maybe it gets rid of the idea that you have to look a certain way to be from somewhere. We are all immigrants."" A Channel 4 documentary following the reconstruction of Cheddar Man - The First Brit: Secrets of the 10,000-Year-Old Man - airs on Sunday 18 February."
2018-02-06,Tesco is potentially facing a record £4bn bill for back pay as a law firm launches an equal pay claim on behalf of store assistants.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180207120555/https://news.sky.com/story/tesco-facing-record-4bn-equal-pay-claim-law-firm-says-11239677,"According to Leigh Day solicitors, up to 200,000 mainly female store workers could be in line for payouts of around £20,000 each. The law firm has lodged complaints with the conciliation service Acas on behalf of almost 100 staff ahead of an employment tribunal process which has already led to similar, continuing claims against Asda and Sainsbury's, involving thousands of staff. Leigh Day believes more workers will join the Tesco case as it progresses. It centres on allegations that store assistants have been paid £3 an hour, or £5,000 a year, less than their male warehouse counterparts, who are on around £11 an hour for essentially the same role. Tesco shares were more than 1% down after the case came to light. A spokesman responded: ""We are unable to comment on a claim that we have not received. ""Tesco has always been a place for people to get on in their career, regardless of their gender, background or education, and we work hard to make sure all our colleagues are paid fairly and equally for the jobs they do."" The law firm's Paula Lee, who is representing the Tesco workers, said: ""We believe an inherent bias has allowed store workers to be underpaid for many years. ""In terms of equal worth to the company there really should be no argument that workers in stores, compared to those working in distribution centres, contribute at least equal value to the vast profits made by Tesco, which last year had group sales of £49.9bn. ""In the week where we have marked the 100-year anniversary since women began to get the vote, the time has come for companies and public organisations to have a long hard look at themselves, to see the inequality which is still deeply entrenched in their organisations."""
2018-02-06,At least five people have died and dozens more are missing after a 6.4 magnitude earthquake shook a city on the east coast of Taiwan.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180207120555/https://news.sky.com/story/hotel-in-taiwan-collapses-after-64-magnitude-earthquake-11239117,"At least five buildings in Hualien City caved in and were shown tilting on their sides in the tourist port city. Rescuers are working to reach five people they know are trapped in buildings, while more than 140 are unaccounted for. The worst hit was a military hospital which rescuers have propped up with cranes as it leans at about 45 degrees. A hotel employee died after the bottom three floors of the Marshal Hotel caved in while another person died in a residential building. Rescuers are trying to free two people trapped in the hotel as family members wait nearby. The quake hit just before midnight on Tuesday night, injuring 243 people, with two dozen in a critical condition, Taiwan's Central News Agency reported. Video footage and photos showed several large buildings leaning at sharp angles. Their lower floors were crushed into heaps of concrete, smashed glass, bent iron beams and other debris. Residents were seen lowering their children from balconies in slanted buildings before climbing down themselves or being helped down by firefighters. The tremor was felt shortly before midnight on Tuesday, forcing the closure of a busy road nearby. The epicentre was very shallow at just 10.6km deep and was the 94th tremor since a 6.1 magnitude quake struck nearby on Sunday. Roads were seen with large cracks in them while the tremor disrupted electricity and water supplies to thousands of households, the National Fire Agency said. The government said a bridge in the city on Taiwan's eastern coast could not be used, and the structure of an inn had tilted during the earthquake. Chen Chih-wei, 80, said he was sleeping on the top floor of his apartment building when the quake struck. ""My bed turned completely vertical, I was sleeping and suddenly I was standing,"" he said. He said it was the strongest tremor he had felt in more than five decades of living in Hualien. In a post on her Facebook page, President Tsai Ing-wen said she had arrived in Hualien on Wednesday morning to review rescue efforts. She said she ""ordered search and rescue workers not to give up on any opportunity to save people, while keeping their own safety in mind"". ""This is when the Taiwanese people show their calm, resilience and love,"" she wrote. ""The government will work with everyone to guard their homeland."" Chen Tzai-Tung, a worker with the government disaster centre, said it was not safe for rescuers to enter the 12-storey Yunmen Cuiti apartment building where most of the missing are thought to be trapped. As aftershocks came through the night 830 people went to shelters, including a newly built baseball stadium where beds and hot food were provided. Taiwan lies along the Ring of Fire, the seismic faults surrounding the Pacific Ocean where the majority of the world's earthquakes occur. The island's worst tremor in recent decades was a 7.6 magnitude quake in September 1999, which killed about 2,400 people. Two years ago, a magnitude 6.4 quake collapsed an apartment building in southern Taiwan, killing 115 people. Five people involved in the construction of the building were found guilty of negligence and sent to prison."

Before that she had not made public any details of her pregnancy and had not even confirmed she was expecting. Jenner apologised to fans for ""keeping you in the dark"" and said she kept the pregnancy private because she needed to ""prepare for this role of a lifetime in the most positive, stress free, and healthy way I knew how"".  Congratulations My Sweet Kylie! What a magical ride it's been! I'll miss you bumping along with me.

She said pregnancy had been the most ""beautiful, empowering and life changing experience"" of her life and she is ""actually going to miss it"". Jenner also shared an 11-minute video giving fans a peek into the last nine months, from the time she found out she was expecting until the baby's birth. During her pregnancy there were several rumours which she chose not to address, only posting pictures on social media where her stomach could not be seen. On the same day her name was disclosed, it was revealed Stormi's father, rapper Travis Scott - real name Jacques Webster - had pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct for an incident last year at a concert in Arkansas. He was arrested after his concert and police claimed he ""encouraged people to rush the stage"" but his lawyer said video footage did not support the allegations so other charges of inciting a riot and endangering the welfare of a minor were dismissed. Jenner's sister, Kim Kardashian, welcomed a baby girl named Chicago via a surrogatein January and her sister Khloe Kardashian is due to give birth in two months."

Until 2015 it was thought she had died of natural causes after suffering from bowel complaints. It wasn't until 2015 that police reopened the case after Rogers' former partner, Sandra Adams, approached them to claim he had admitted killing his grandmother by smothering her with a pillow. The army veteran, 33, of Fishguard, was also said to have told previous partners of his mother's involvement in the incident. That saw her feed Mrs Guy a concoction of pills and whisky before Rogers put the pillow over Mrs Guy's face. Police arrested Rogers and his mother on 5 October 2016, and while they were in custody at a station a listening device was installed in her home. Excerpts from the recordings - taken from the days after the arrests - were heard by the jury at Swansea Crown Court this week, in which John, 50, of St Dogmaels, and Rogers discussed their roles in the seemingly unmotivated killing. The first excerpt, taken from the afternoon of 6 October 2016, features John telling Rogers she had been arrested for Mrs Guy's murder. Rogers replied: ""But I did it."" He then attempted to reassure his mother by telling her that he had told police Mrs Guy ""was dead before I got there"", and that she had ""nothing to worry about"". Later that evening, John admitted she was ""glad"" she had not told police about giving her mother the tablets. They go on to reveal the pills were a mixture of crushed diazepam and zopiclone. The following day, they expressed concern that police could find incriminating text messages regarding their plans to kill the pensioner, with Rogers telling his mother that ""a slip of a word here or there"" would put them in ""jail for life"". His fears were well placed as, almost 16 months to the day, he and his mother were told by Mr Justice Lewis that he would sentence them to life behind bars. ""You have been found guilty of the murder of Betty Guy,"" he said on Tuesday, after the pair - who denied murder after being formally charged last July - were convicted by the jury. Gemma Vincent, of the CPS, said the covert recordings used to build the case were not common practice, but that they had provided the jury with ""compelling evidence"" that the killing was ""deliberate and planned"". Speaking after the verdict, another of Mrs Guy's children, Lorraine Matthews, said the family had been left ""shocked and horrified"" by the true nature of her death. ""Now that the case has drawn to a close we are satisfied that justice has prevailed and now we can close this very sad chapter in our lives,"" she said. John and Rogers will be sentenced on Thursday."

But after MPs held a series of meetings with Mr Javid and Chancellor Philip Hammond, the Government has pledged an extra £150m for social care and a further £16m for remote rural areas. Rebel MPs, led by Daniet Kawczynski, claim the extra £166m is not enough to meet the spiralling costs of social care, however, and are still prepared to vote against the Government In a statement to the MPs on the eve of the crucial vote, Mr Javid said: ""I recognise the need to prioritise spending on social care services that councils provide to our elderly and vulnerable citizens. ""This is why we announced an additional £2bn at Spring Budget 2017 for adult social care over the three years from 2017-18. ""And, having listening to representations since the provisional settlement, I am today announcing a further £150m in 2018-19 for an Adult Social Care Support Grant."" On help for rural areas, Mr Javid said: ""I am committed to ensuring the needs of rural areas are met and recognise the particular costs of providing services in sparse rural areas. ""So in 2018-19, in response to representations made since the provisional settlement, I will increase the Rural Services Delivery Grant by £31m - £16m more than proposed in the provisional settlement. ""This will take the total to £81m, a little over the 2016-17 level and the highest it has ever been."" But Mr Kawczynski told Sky News that while the extra cash was welcome it was not enough and that he and half a dozen Conservative MPs are still prepared to vote against the Government. ""Social care cuts are spiralling out of control, councils are unable to cope,"" he said. ""I have six or seven other Tories who are prepared to go as far as me."" Mr Kawczynski, MP for Shrewsbury and Atcham, said the costs of social care are higher in rural areas because of the number of people retiring to the countryside. ""Shropshire Council is facing a black hole of £10m to pay for the rising costs of adult social care,"" he said. ""I cannot support the proposed settlement until government finds more money to help my council meet these costs."" But Paul Carter, chairman of the County Councils Network and leader of Kent County Council, said: ""We welcome the Government listening to our case and providing local government with much-needed extra resource to go towards meeting the rising costs in social care, particularly in counties who have unique pressures as they are home to the largest and fastest growing elderly populations."""

""But it was just the speed of it. The quantity of people involved, the number of firefighters there. I've never ever experienced anything like it before. It was shocking.""

He said: ""I was asleep at the time, and my mum called me up and said 'are you at this fire?' ""I thought, I've missed another fire, and then I looked at my phone and thought 'oh my god'. ""So I came down to the fire station - I went to the tower and tried to offer my help, but there were so many people they were sending people away.

Ms Ayling, 20, was allegedly drugged and stuffed into a suitcase after her job took her to a fake photoshoot in Milan. The captors allegedly threatened to auction her on the internet while trying to extort £230,000 from her agent Phil Green. As the trial opened, one officer described how Ms Ayling suffered ""physical violence including being drugged, handcuffed and brutally transported inside a suitcase"". Ms Ayling told police she was taken to a remote farmhouse near Turin and was held captive for six days before being freed when kidnappers discovered she was a mother. Herba is charged with kidnapping after being arrested on 18 July, with GPS data leading officers to the farmhouse where she was allegedly held. The 30-year-old told the court he did not knowingly take part in any crime, and he described Ms Ayling as ""free, chilled and relaxed"" when he met her on 10 July. Judge Ilio Mannucci Pacini allowed the accused to sit on a bench after he originally appeared in court in a cage.

2018-02-08,Council tax and charges look set to be hiked by nearly all local authorities in England as they scramble to raise funds for services such as social care.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180208145048/https://news.sky.com/story/council-tax-hikes-loom-across-england-to-fund-social-care-survey-finds-11241171,"According to research commissioned by the Local Government Information Unit (LGIU), some 95% plan to raise council tax while 93% will increase service costs. The measures are said to be needed to ease the burden on public services. The biggest fears are for children's services (nearly 32% of councils), followed by adult social care (nearly 28%) and housing and homelessness (19%). Councils can raise tax by up to 3% this year, in line with inflation, before triggering a local referendum. The LGIU said its results proved the system was ""unsustainable"". ""Councils are on the edge,"" the think-tank's chief executive Jonathan Carr-West said. ""They are for the most part holding services together (though a significant minority are not). ""But they can only do this this by raising council tax, increasing charging and draining their reserves. ""The system is unsustainable and needs far more fundamental reform than is presently on offer. ""It's simply not acceptable that we don't know how local government will work post-2020. ""Many will have to make tough decisions about which services have to be scaled back or stopped altogether to plug funding gaps."" Some 113 councils - about a third of all local authorities in England - responded to the survey. A spokesperson for the for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: ""Our finance settlement strikes a balance between relieving growing pressure on local government whilst ensuring that hard-pressed taxpayers do not face excessive bills. ""We have listened to representations made from councils and delivered on these with extra funding."" It comes after Communities Secretary Sajid Javid was forced to buy off potential Tory rebels threatening a mutiny over town hall funding. He and Chancellor Philip Hammond promised another £150m to fund local social care services - with an extra £16m for rural areas."
2018-02-08,"Britain's retail sector could be hit by a 20% rise in costs after Brexit, while car makers could see a 13% hike in manufacturing costs outside the EU, according to the Government's own internal estimates, seen by Sky News.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180208145048/https://news.sky.com/story/new-brexit-leak-reveals-steep-costs-for-uk-industries-11240583,"The forecast impact of Brexit on every industrial sector of the economy reveals the estimated added costs to UK companies. So-called non-tariff barriers as a result of leaving the EU have also been calculated to add as much as 16% in costs in the food, drink, defence and education sectors. The estimates are from the same document as an earlier leak of the forecast economic impact on the UK's nations and regions. The analysis has been prepared by Government economists for Cabinet ministers, ahead of their discussions on future trading relationships with the EU, to be held on Thursday. The estimated impact of Brexit on the UK's industrial sectors are what drive the eye-watering hits to growth over the next 15 years that have been forecast in certain parts of the country. They are calculated from the estimated effect of non-tariff barrier costs on British businesses, which will be introduced to UK-EU trade upon withdrawal from the bloc. Those costs have been expressed in percentage terms as if they were a regular tariff on trade. The non-tariff barriers include extra customs checks, rules of origin regulations, added paperwork, and diverging regulatory standards. Essentially, they are a calculation of the 'friction' that will be introduced to trade across almost all UK industrial sectors. The Government no longer promises that post-Brexit trade with the EU - the UK's biggest market - will be frictionless after Brexit, instead claiming it will be ""as frictionless as possible"". The document, circulated to members of the key Cabinet sub-committee due to meet on Thursday, estimates the range of potential non-tariff costs in key industrial sectors. Tariff equivalent of non-tariff barrier costs, by sector: :: Machinery, equipment and energy: 2% to 6%:: Chemical, rubber and plastic: 6% to 12%:: Other manufacturing: 5% to 12%:: Motor vehicles: 5% to 13%:: Food and drink: 8% to 16%:: Agriculture: 8% to 17%:: Construction: 0%:: Business services: 0% to 6%:: Other services: 2% to 10%:: Financial services: 5% to 10%:: Defence, education and health: 6% to 16%:: Retail and wholesale: 7% to 20% Agriculture could be hit by extra costs of between eight and 17%, although that could be mitigated by changing regulations and free-trade deals with new markets. In response to the leaked analysis, a Government spokesperson said: ""This document does not represent Government policy and does not consider the outcome we are seeking in the negotiations.

2018-02-08,"January was the second-worst month on record for NHS A&E departments, with 85.3% of patients seen and treated or discharged within the four-hour target.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180208145048/https://news.sky.com/story/latest-nhs-figures-show-hospitals-remain-close-to-capacity-11240939,"The figure is well short of the target of dealing with 95% of patients within that timeframe, but a slight improvement on the December figure of 85.1%, which was the joint-worst on record. While there was a slight improvement across all emergency departments, performance at Type 1 A&Es, defined as consultant-led 24 hours facilities, was the worst-ever at 77.1%. Type 1 departments see close to 70% of patients and include most large hospital emergency departments where the most seriously ill patients are taken. NHS England welcomed the figures as evidence that the system has coped despite the worst flu season in seven years, and said 1.7 million patients were treated within four hours, up more than 5% on this time last year. A spokesperson for NHS England said: ""Despite the worst flu season in seven years, A&E performance improved this month. It was better than both the month before, and was better too than the same time last winter. ""This was partly helped by the fact that NHS-related Delayed Transfers of Care fell to their lowest in four years, freeing up beds for patients needing emergency hospitalisation."" Doctors remain deeply concerned at the pressure on the system, saying that hospitals remain understaffed and short of bed capacity. Independent health charity the Nuffield Trust said the figures showed there were more trolley waits than ever before. Its chief economist John Appleby said: ""Today's figures provide hard evidence on just how bad a winter the NHS is having: over 80,000 patients waited on trolleys for more than four hours at A&E in January, of whom over 1,000 were waiting for over 12 hours. These are the highest numbers since records began. ""A year ago we warned that corridors had become the new emergency wards. ""It is deeply concerning that 12 months on the position has worsened, with many harrowing reports of patients being treated in busy corridors by stressed and overworked staff. ""Meanwhile waits for planned care are at their longest for nine years. Every part of the NHS is creaking at the seams. ""It is time to face facts and offer sustainable funding increases to the health service."" Nick Scriven, President of the Society of Acute Medicine, said: ""The last six weeks has seen the acute services of the NHS under a sustained period of stress due to 'normal' winter pressures along with a surge in influenza. ""Neither of these were unpredictable but both have combined to cause the issues that have been widely reported across the country."" ""Last year we coined the phrase 'eternal winter', but the last month and a half has shown an even steeper decline in performance."" The Royal College of Surgeons said Government interventions to try and ease pressure, which included an injection of £335m in the Autumn Budget, had failed. ""Today's figures show that short-term measures to create extra capacity in the NHS are insufficient to meet NHS performance targets. ""We currently do not have adequate funding or capacity in our health and social care services and we need to urgently find a long-term solution."" Weekly situation reports also published today show that the system remains under pressure, with almost 11,400 people facing ambulance handover delays of more than 30 minutes last week, and 95% of beds occupied."
2018-02-08,"New rules to clampdown on bullying and sexual harassment in Parliament have been hailed as a ""potential game-changer"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180208145048/https://news.sky.com/story/mps-could-be-expelled-for-sexual-abuse-and-harassment-under-new-game-changer-rules-11240799,"MPs and peers face being suspended or in extreme cases recalled or expelled under the most serious punishments revealed in a report on Thursday. A survey commissioned alongside the new rules lay bare the prevalence of harassment and intimidation at the heart of Westminster. More than half of MPs and peers' staff - 53% - said they had experienced, witnessed or heard of bullying or harassment as part of their job. Some 75% of those who experienced it directly did not speak to their boss. And only 50% of respondents working in the Commons and 52% of those in the Lords said they had confidence in authorities to manage the complaints. Sexual harassment specifically proved prominent, with nearly one in five parliamentary workers reporting they had been subjected to it. The survey was open for one week and attracted 1,377 replies - 17% of workers on the estate. Green MP Caroline Lucas, who sat on the working group that commissioned the survey and report, said the findings ""have the potential to shake up a really toxic political culture in Westminster"". Asked if the recommendations went far enough, she told Sky News: ""It's adequate; it's a potential game-changer."" Ms Lucas asked why mandatory training for MPs, peers and staff was not being introduced until the next parliament - expected to be 2022 - but said ""the fact it's there at all is a significant step"". Commenting on the survey results, the Brighton Pavilion MP added: ""Those figures are shocking. ""People are entitled to expect a safe and dignified environment, nowhere more so than in Parliament, which should be a beacon of best practice, not running to catch up. ""People who know the culture won't be surprised but it urgently needs to be changed."" The report comes from a cross-party group, chaired by Leader of the House of Commons Andrea Leadsom. It was set up in the wake of the harassment scandal that saw Sir Michael Fallon resign as Defence Secretary and took evidence from experts for over six weeks. It appeared to challenge criticism from MPs and campaigners that came in January when Sky News obtained a leaked copy of the draft version. Responding to criticism that a change in workplace culture was a ""long-term project beyond the working group's terms of reference"", the updated report said it was making recommendations for both ""the immediate future and the longer-term"". Ms Leadsom said in a statement on Thursday that ""it is a right not a privilege to be treated with dignity and respect at work"". She promised that work to achieve that would ""proceed at pace over the next few months"". MPs and peers will vote to accept the plans, with a debate taking place in the last week of February or first week of March. The working group will become a ""steering group"" to oversee its report's implementation, with a review planned after its first six to 18 months to analyse its effect."
2018-02-08,"Social care in England is running as a ""Cinderella service""which is undervalued, the National Audit Office (NAO) has said.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180208145048/https://news.sky.com/story/adult-social-care-run-as-cinderella-service-11240773,"The Department of Health and Social Care is not doing enough to support the development of a sustainable workforce, a new report into England's adult social care sector found. There is a growing demand for care but not enough staff and the number of people with unmet needs is increasing, it added. Recruiting and retaining staff is increasingly difficult, but the department does not have a current workforce strategy, the authors said. The report looked at Age UK analysis which estimated 12 million people over the age of 65 had some level of unmet care needs in 2016/17. There is also a higher than national average vacancy rate and a growing staff turnover rate. The NAO said workers feel undervalued and there is little opportunity for career progression. In England there are about 1.34 million adult social care jobs, with about half of care workers paid £7.50 an hour last year - the national minimum wage. The authors said: ""The one and a half million people working in adult social care in England provide essential support to adults with care needs, yet the care sector is undervalued and its workers poorly rewarded."" The NAO recommended a national workforce strategy be produced and investment made to enable providers to pay staff adequately and to offer career development and training opportunities. ""Social care cannot continue as a Cinderella service - without a valued and rewarded workforce, adult social care cannot fulfil its crucial role of supporting elderly and vulnerable people in society,"" Amyas Morse, NAO head said. ""Pressures and demands on the health and social care systems are increasing, so the department needs to respond quickly to this challenge by giving the sector the attention it deserves and needs, instead of falling short and not delivering value for money."" Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said: ""This report is a damning indictment of the failure of successive governments to carry out workforce planning and the end result is the dangerously fragile situation we see today - one that means that in some parts of the country there are not enough care staff to give older people the support they need, even if they are willing and able to pay top rates for it. A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said: ""Everyone is entitled to good quality care and we recognise there are challenges - that's why we will shortly publish a health and care workforce strategy to address these issues. ""We've provided an extra £2bn funding to the sector and this week announced a further £150m for next year - in the summer we will outline plans to reform social care to ensure it is sustainable for the future."""

Prosecutors alleged that Carty, now 59, had hired three men to kidnap Joana Rodridguez and her newborn son. She planned to keep the child and pass it off as her own, they said. But Carty has always maintained her innocence and her lawyers say she was convicted largely on the word of her co-accused. She was granted a new hearing by the appeals court in 2016 to present what she claimed was new evidence proving her innocence. Carty argued prosecutors had coerced witnesses and withheld evidence. But a judge dismissed that appeal, saying there was overwhelming evidence of her guilt, and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has now confirmed his decision. Carty was born on the Caribbean island of St Kitts when it was still subject to British rule and she retains a UK passport. The Foreign Office has supported her cause and expressed concern about the prospect of her facing execution. In an interview with Sky News on death row at Huntsville Prison in 2012, Carty protested her innocence and pleaded for more assistance from the UK. She said: ""I am 110% innocent. ""We are British. I can't wash off my nationality with soap and water. I am going to always be British. ""I won't get up and ask the British Government to go out in the public and lobby for me had I known that I am guilty because then it would be an embarrassment not only to myself and my family but also the country that I love. ""So for me when I say I am innocent and that I didn't commit this crime I mean that."" Her case has received celebrity backing and the support of campaigners at the human rights organisation Reprieve. But the US Supreme Court refused to take up her case in 2010 and her legal options have continued to narrow. She is one of more than 50 women on death rows across the United States, six of them in Texas. The state has carried out more than a third of all of the executions since the US restored the death penalty in 1976. But the number of executions being carried out has continued to decline across the country. Texas, which saw 40 executions in 2000, carried out seven last year."

But now a law has been enforced establishing domestic partnerships instead, a move that critics have described as an unprecedented rollback of civil rights. Bermuda's government said the legislation signed by Governor John Rankin aims to balance opposition to same-sex marriage with European court rulings that ensure recognition and protection for same sex-couples on the island. Parliament had overwhelmingly passed the legislation in December, and a majority of Bermudans voted against same-sex marriage in a referendum. ""The act is intended to strike a fair balance between two currently irreconcilable groups in Bermuda, by restating that marriage must be between a male and a female while at the same time recognising and protecting the rights of same-sex couples,"" said minister of home affairs Walton Brown. Around half a dozen same-sex marriages that occurred between the court ruling last May and the repeal are recognised under the new law. Now, couples in a registered domestic partnership will have ""equivalent"" rights to married heterosexual couples, including the right to take medical decisions on behalf of one's partner. But LGBTQ civil rights groups said the unprecedented decision gave same-sex couples second-class status. Ty Cobb, director of the Human Rights Campaign Global, said: ""Governor Rankin and the Bermuda parliament have shamefully made Bermuda the first national territory in the world to repeal marriage equality."" The issue has also been raised in the British parliament. While expressing the British government's ""disappointment"" at Bermuda's decision, Foreign Office minister Harriet Baldwin told MPs Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson decided it would ""not be appropriate"" to block the move. Prime Minister Theresa May's official spokesman said: ""We are seriously disappointed that the Domestic Partnership Bill removes the right for same-sex couples to marry in Bermuda. ""But that Bill has been democratically passed by the Parliament of Bermuda, and our relationship with the overseas territories is based on partnership and respect for their right to democratic self-government."" In a message on Twitter, Green Party leader Caroline Lucas said this stance was an ""absolute scandal"". She added: ""The FCO claims to stand for LGBT+ rights, yet in a territory THEY GOVERN they are waving through the repealing of same-sex marriage. This is a breach of human rights, and the Government should reverse their decision immediately."""

Witnesses reportedly described how she became trapped under a fence as students queued to get into the busy club, before doormen tried in vain to resuscitate her. One witness, who did not want to be named, told the Northern Echo: ""People were barging to get in. The queue has gone around the fence and as they pushed to get in it caused the fence to fall over. ""The girl was trapped under the fence and crushed. There was a fair bit of panic."" The witness said a bouncer took his shirt off to stem the bleeding from the victim's head before delivering CPR with his colleagues. Another reveller, named only as Jack, described the scene outside Missoula as ""complete chaos"" and claimed security staff had stopped allowing people into the club shortly before the woman's death. He told student newspaper The Tab: ""People were trying to reason with them, telling the bouncers it wasn't safe and someone was going to get hurt. ""In the end they put a barrier in front of the people at the front, who had been slowly moving forward due to being pushed from behind.

One witness, who did not wish to be named, told Sky News that the queue outside Missoula was ""always dangerous"". ""It's an incredibly sad day for the Durham student body,"" he added. Durham Constabulary said it was investigating the incident, adding: ""The circumstances surrounding her death are unclear at this time.""

Amino acids are essential building blocks that cells use to make proteins. The body already produces some asparagine but it is also found in our diet in foods such as asparagus, soy, dairy, poultry, beef and seafood. Researchers at the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute found that blocking the production of asparagine with a drug called L-asparaginase, and putting the mice on a low-asparagine diet greatly reduced the breast cancer's ability to spread. In future, the scientists believe that alongside conventional treatments like chemotherapy, breast cancer patients could be given a diet in hospital that restricts asparagine to help stop the disease spreading. ""When the availability of asparagine was reduced, we saw little impact on the primary tumour in the breast, but tumour cells had reduced capacity for metastases (spread) in other parts of the body,"" the study's lead author, Professor Greg Hannon, said. ""This finding adds vital information to our understanding of how we can stop cancer spreading - the main reason patients die from their disease. ""In the future, restricting this amino acid through a controlled diet plan or by other means could be an additional part of treatment for some patients with breast and other cancers."""

On 29 January, the gunman shot at a man multiple times outside a convenience store in Logandale, north of Las Vegas, before fleeing. The victim survived. Just hours later, at 3am, the same suspect was captured on CCTV approaching a group of homeless people sleeping outside a strip mall in Washington Avenue. He shot 51-year-old Brian Wayne Clegg dead. A few hours later he opened fire on another homeless man sleeping near the same road, shooting him in the face. The man survived but could not provide any details about what happened, police said. On Friday, the same man was captured on CCTV approaching a fourth victim sleeping near 14th Street. He shot him twice in the head, killing him, before fleeing in an SUV. The man was named as James Edgar Lewis, 64, whose devastated daughter had been looking for him for years. She only found out he was homeless when police told her he had died. Police captain Robert Plummer said: ""After killing two people and shooting two others, if he isn't a serial killer, he's on his way to being one."" He said the FBI's definition of a serial killer is someone who kills three or more people with about a month between each one. Police said the gunman ""can only be described"" as a white or Hispanic man who is about 6ft tall and was driving a silver or light blue Hyundai Tucson Sport Limited SUV. Forensic analysts have connected one gun to all four shootings. Residents and business operators near the scenes have been asked to check their surveillance footage between 29 January and 2 February for any clues. Police patrols in Las Vegas' homeless areas have been stepped up. ""To target homeless, a very vulnerable segment of our society, is cowardly,"" Mr Plummer said. ""It's unfortunate that anyone is homeless in today's society, but the fact that they're homeless doesn't mean they're easy targets for being a victim."""

He is alleged to have attended ""a place or places in Iraq and Syria where instruction or training was provided"", in relation to the commission or preparation of a terrorist act on or before 15 February 2016. The offence is contrary to section eight of the Terrorism Act 2006 and it is the first charge of its kind in the UK. Many British men have travelled to Syria to fight IS with the YPG, which is mostly made up of Kurdish men and women, and a number of them have died in the conflict. Oliver Hall, from Portsmouth, died while clearing mines in Raqqa in November, with others to have died including sniper Jac Holmes, 24, and Mehmet Aksoy, 32, who died in an IS attack. Ryan Lock, 20, shot himself to avoid being taken hostage and Luke Rutter, 22, Dean Evans, 22, and Konstandinos Erik Scurfield, 25, were all killed in operations against IS.

Between 20 to 30 artillery and tank rounds landed within 500m of the HQ, where coalition advisers are working with SDF fighters battling Islamic State militants east of the Euphrates River in Syria. The Syrian army, which is supported by Iranian-backed militias and Russian forces, are active on the other side of the river by the city of Deir al-Zor. The US-led coalition had previously alerted Russian officials about the presence of SDF forces in nearby Khusham after seeing a slow build-up of pro-government forces during the last week. Details of the thwarted attack were released by US officials who wished to remain anonymous. Coalition officials were in regular contact with their Russian counterparts before, during and after the attack, who had assured them that they would not target US and SDF forces in the area. No American troops were wounded or killed in the attack, however one SDF member was hurt. Officials believe the attack was an attempt by pro-regime forces to take back land the SDF had liberated from IS fighters in September, including oil fields in Khusham. Interfax news agency quoted Franz Klintsevich, a Russian parliamentarian, condemning the airstrikes: ""The actions of the US coalition do not comply with legal norms, beyond all doubt it is aggression."" Meanwhile, the UN humanitarian coordinator for Syria, Panos Moumtzis, has appealed for an immediate ceasefire as the Syrian conflict escalates. ""We have multiple fronts with people in extreme danger without a view to a solution,"" he said. Members of the UN Security Council are meeting later behind closed doors to discuss the situation. It comes after 19 children were killed in a round of airstrikes by the Syrian regime on a rebel enclave near the capital Damascus. The town of Douma in eastern Ghouta was under siege on Wednesday, with the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reporting that 34 people had been killed and about 200 more injured in the bombardment. It came less than 24 hours after the region - controlled by rebel factions, including Islamists - suffered some of its worst bloodshed in years, with 80 civilians left dead by regime warplanes. More than 340,000 people have been killed and millions displaced since the conflict in Syria erupted in March 2011."
2018-02-08,"Stonehenge could lose its World Heritage status if plans for a tunnel near the famous ring of stones get the go ahead, historians have warned.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180208145048/https://news.sky.com/story/stonehenge-could-lose-world-heritage-status-over-tunnel-plans-historians-warn-11240768,"Under the newest proposals the Highways Agency wants to build a 1.8 mile tunnel to try and ease traffic on the A303 which passes through Stonehenge and is often heavily congested. It insists the tunnel would be deep enough not to damage the Wiltshire archaeological area which is believed to have been constructed between 3,000BC and 2,000BC. The latest design, which has been altered after previous concerns were raised, has been welcomed by English Heritage, Historic England and the National Trust. However, they are still worried about the proposal to link two byways, introducing a new route for vehicles close to Stonehenge after the tunnel is built. They are also calling for a 200m grass canopy at the entrance and exit of the tunnel. They said: ""This is a once in a generation opportunity to reunite this ancient landscape giving people the opportunity to tread pathways used by our ancestors who built the monuments, to visit and appreciate the monuments and to see and hear wildlife without the intrusion of traffic noise from the road."" But some historians warned that Stonehenge could have its World Heritage status taken away if the Government pushes ahead with the proposed works. Others have expressed concern about nearby sites, such as Blick Mead, which is the only place in Britain where human habitation can be traced back to 8,000BC. In October, volunteers found preserved hoof prints of wild cattle, known as aurochs, near to where the proposed flyover would be built. Professor Simon Jacques from Buckingham University, who led the excavation, told Sky News: ""There is no excuse for this site to be totally neglected. I mean it is right next to the flyover and about 500 metres from the Eastern portal. ""People have known it has been there for a long time. ""Places like this are incredibly rare in the British Isles and anywhere in the world and we have essentially got a unique national archive. ""All of the organics that we have got on the site, imagine they're documents. ""With what Highways England plans to do, with their eight metre high flyover, the water will be drained holding all those organisms and the site will in effect, it will be killed."" However, in nearby villages like Shrewton, which is blighted by traffic, some residents are keen for the tunnel to be built and have taken the law into their own hands. Janice Hassett, who runs the Stonehenge Traffic Action Group, has been trained up by Wiltshire Police to help catch speeding drivers. She said: ""There are very few pavements in the high street and there are lots of elderly people, mothers with prams. The school is on the high street and it's very dangerous, especially on Friday and Saturday mornings"". Highways England has opened a consultation today which will run until April to gauge public opinion on the controversial matter. The group's chief excutive Jim O'Sullivan said: ""These upgrades in the South West will improve millions of journeys. ""Each of these milestones in the region is evidence of Highways England delivering major infrastructure upgrades for the whole country."" The upgrades are funded by the Government's £15 billion investment into motorways and main A-roads across the country."
2018-02-08,"Suffragettes used a wide variety of methods to force politicians to embrace their cause of votes for women, including arson attacks on post boxes and bombing the chancellor's house.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180208145048/https://news.sky.com/story/women-would-have-got-the-vote-earlier-if-not-for-suffragette-terrorists-11227772,"Here, two historians say whether they should be judged today as terrorists. Suffragettes are seen as selfless today but in the early 1900s they were regarded as terrorists, historian Simon Webb writes. Even the mildest criticism of the suffragettes makes many people feel uneasy. The image which we have of them today is that of selfless and patient women, enduring imprisonment, hunger strikes and the horror of force-feeding in pursuit of what was surely a just cause - that of equality of rights between men and women. Their weapons were, we have been led to suppose, those of passive resistance and peaceful protest, rather than violence against others. The worst they might have done is break windows or chain themselves to railings. This popular perception is quite false; the suffragette movement was actually a terrorist organisation. In the years leading up to the First World War, the suffragettes conducted a ferocious and prolonged bombing campaign across the whole of the United Kingdom; planting improvised explosive devices (or IEDs) in places as varied as Westminster Abbey, St Paul's Cathedral, the Bank of England, the National Gallery, railway stations and many other locations. :: The women who risked all to get the vote The first terrorist bomb to explode in Ireland in the 20th century was planted not by the IRA, but by the suffragettes. They also invented the letter bomb; designed to maim or kill those with whom they disagreed. One of the first bomb attacks carried out by the suffragettes was on the house of chancellor of the exchequer Lloyd George. It went off at a little after 6am on 19 February 1913. The bomb, which brought down ceilings and cracked walls, was planted by none other than Emily Davison, who later died beneath the hooves of the king's horse at the 1913 Derby. There is currently talk of erecting a statue of Emmeline Pankhurst near Parliament, which is a little strange when we consider how unpopular terrorists are these days. Pankhurst was the leader of the suffragette terrorists. After the explosion at Lloyd George's house, she was brought to trial at the Old Bailey for complicity in the attack and sentenced to three years imprisonment. Those planning the bombings were not lone wolves or mavericks; they were being directed and supported by the suffragette leadership. :: I'm glad history is finally recognising my suffragette great-great-grandmother The day after Mrs Pankhurst was sent to prison, a bomb was placed outside the Bank of England. Fortunately, a policeman managed to defuse it before it detonated in the crowded street. For the next 16 months, the bomb attacks came thick and fast. Some devices, such as one planted at St Paul's Cathedral on 7 May 1913, failed to explode. Others, such as the large device left at the Royal Observatory in Edinburgh a fortnight later, did go off, causing a great deal of damage. The wave of bombings led to a hardening in the government's position, as well as alienating those who supported the idea of a change in the law to allow women the vote. There had been every chance before the bombings began that a private members' bill to introduce the vote for women might succeed in getting through Parliament. But few politicians wished to be seen giving in to terrorism and, as a result, this bill failed even to gain a second reading. After the failure of the bill, it was plain that the suffragette bombers were harming the struggle for women's civil rights far more than they were aiding it. Throughout 1913 and the first half of 1914, the bomb attacks increased, striking places as diverse as Holloway Prison and the changing rooms at Cambridge University's football ground. Churches became prime targets, because of a perceived opposition of the Church of England to women's rights. Among the churches where bombs exploded were St Martin-in-the-Fields, in Trafalgar Square, Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland, famous from The Da Vinci Code, and, on 11 June 1914, Westminster Abbey; damaging the Coronation Chair. The last bomb of the campaign exploded at Christ Church Cathedral in the Irish town of Lisburn, on 1 August 1914. That same day, Germany declared war on Russia and then, two days later, on France. The First World War had begun. With the outbreak of the war, the suffragettes abandoned their activities and threw themselves into the war effort. The struggle to win the vote was forgotten in an upsurge of patriotic feeling. The terrorist bombings carried out by the suffragettes have today been almost wholly forgotten; replaced with a sanitised view of the activists as people who would do nothing more dangerous than break the occasional shop window. Far from hastening the granting of votes for women, the suffragettes impeded the political progress towards this aim by their dangerous actions, causing most people to reject them as violent fanatics. Had it not been for the bombings, there is every chance that the vote would have been given to women before, rather than after, the First World War. :: Simon Webb is the author of The Suffragette Bombers: Britain's Forgotten Terrorists. Those few people who claim the suffragettes were terrorists are misguided and sensationalist, writes women's history professor June Purvis. They are simply seeking to condemn these radical women who were campaigning for their democratic right to the parliamentary vote. Although there is no one accepted definition of terrorism, a key aspect is the intention to harm or take life, particularly of innocent civilians. If Emmeline Pankhurst, the inspirational leader of the suffragettes, were alive today, she would be horrified by the actions of the present-day suicide bombers who ruthlessly kill and injure at random, women, men and children going about their daily lives. The suffragettes did not kill or harm anyone. Throughout the suffrage campaign, Emmeline Pankhurst emphasised that human life should not be endangered. As late as 1975, the former suffragette Mary Leigh, then in her nineties, recollected: ""Mrs Pankhurst gave us strict orders… there was not a cat or a canary to be killed: no life."" The suffragettes were members of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), founded by Emmeline Pankhurst, her eldest daughter Christabel and some socialist women in Manchester in 1903. This new organisation, which was for women only, was to campaign for the parliamentary vote for women on the same terms as men. It aimed to attract women of all social classes and political affiliations, and to unite them under the slogan, 'Deeds, not words'. In its early years, the WSPU engaged in peaceful protest that did not catch the attention of an all-male parliament, nor the press. Christabel Pankhurst, the WSPU's brilliant key strategist, decided that more confrontational tactics were necessary. On 13 October 1905, she and fellow suffragette Annie Kenney were arrested after they shouted out a question about votes for women at a Liberal Party meeting at the Free Trade Hall in Manchester. In court the next day, the two women, as planned, chose imprisonment rather than pay a fine for their ""unruly"" conduct. Although the newspapers of the day condemned their ""unladylike"" behaviour, the stunt worked in that many more women flocked to join the WSPU. From then on, heckling of MPs and a willingness to go to prison became common suffragette tactics. With their cry of ""Rise Up Women!"" the charismatic Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst, both powerful orators, roused thousands of women to demand, rather than ask nicely, for their democratic right. However, successive deputations to Parliament and imaginative stunts to support their cause - such as chaining themselves to the railings of No 10 - had no effect. Herbert Asquith, the Liberal prime minister for most of the campaign, was a fervent opponent of votes for women. By 1912, the suffragettes were banned from attending Liberal Party meetings and banned from holding their own. Denied legitimate means of protest, a minority of the women engaged in damage to private and public property - mass window smashing, firing empty buildings or destroying mail in postboxes. But such violent, unlawful acts of vandalism were not terrorism. Nor did the Liberal government denigrate the WSPU as a terrorist organisation or prosecute militant suffragettes as terrorists. We must also remember why some of the suffragettes turned to these more violent tactics and discuss state violence against the women. Even when campaigning peacefully before 1912, the suffragettes could be roughly handled by the police, or forcibly fed if they went on hunger strike. Forcible feeding was a brutal, life-threatening and degrading procedure, performed by male doctors on struggling female bodies. Many of the women spoke of it as a form of instrumental rape. Some would be fed 242 times. The violence inflicted on the suffragettes by the police on 10 November 1910, when another peaceful deputation tried to reach parliament, had been a turning point. The women were treated with exceptional brutality, many of the assaults being sexual in nature. Legs were kicked, arms twisted, breasts pinched, knees thrust between legs. This state-inflicted violence on Black Friday, as the day became known, was frequently cited as the reason the more extreme forms of vandalism suffragettes engaged in from 1912. What was the point of women's bodies being battered and assaulted in their just demand for the vote if damage to property brought about a quicker arrest? Far from being terrorists, the suffragettes played a critical part in the passing of the 1918 Representation of the People Act which granted the parliamentary vote to all women graduates and certain categories of women aged 30 and over. Their contribution to the making of our modern democracy must not be written out of history. :: June Purvis is Emeritus Professor of Women's & Gender History at the University of Portsmouth. She has written many articles and books on the women's suffrage movement, including Emmeline Pankhurst: A Biography, and Christabel Pankhurst: A Biography."
2018-02-08,The Bank of England has signalled that interest rates are to rise sooner than previously thought as it upgraded forecasts for UK growth.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180208145048/https://news.sky.com/story/bank-of-england-holds-interest-rates-at-05-11241172,"Rate-setters unanimously voted to leave rates on hold for now at 0.5% but gave new guidance on their future path - sending the pound up by nearly two cents against the US dollar to almost $1.41. Just before 6pm, however, it had fallen slightly to $1.39. The Bank's upgrade for UK growth in its quarterly inflation report comes as the global economy expands more quickly than expected. It said that monetary policy would now ""need to be tightened somewhat earlier and by a somewhat greater extent"" than it had previously predicted. The Bank's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee is now predicting that its base rate will reach 1.2% by the start of 2021, a figure that would almost certainly require three separate rate rises. Market predictions are that the first of these may come as early as May. The prospect of higher rates continues the slow drift away from an era of easy, cheap money, which has been in place since the financial crisis nearly ten years ago. It has helped sustain a period of consumer spending, but has also left many savers with meagre returns on their investments. The Bank has upgraded its predictions for the growth of the UK economy, forecasting an expansion of 1.7% in 2018 rather than the 1.5% it had previously pencilled in. It thinks that will be followed by growth of 1.8% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020. Almost all of this improvement has been ascribed to the health of the global economy, which is growing faster than originally thought. ""Notwithstanding recent volatility in financial markets, global financial conditions remain supportive,"" say the committee minutes. ""UK net trade is benefiting from robust global demand and the past depreciation of sterling."" The committee said, however, that it was ""an important judgment"" as to how much the UK would benefit from booming economies in other countries, bearing in mind ""continuing Brexit-related uncertainties"". Indeed, the committee's minutes show clearly that Brexit remains its most pressing worry. Despite writing that ""households and companies base their decisions on the expectation of a smooth adjustment to that new trading relationship"", the minutes also describe the effects of Brexit negotiations as ""the most significant influence on, and source of uncertainty about, the economic outlook"". Bank of England governor Mark Carney said: ""The economic outlook will continue to evolve. There will be ups and downs in financial markets. The Brexit process will twist and turn before it is concluded."" The Bank is predicting that inflation will gradually fall back from its present rate of 3% over the course of the coming three years. It touched 3.1% in November, compelling Mr Carney to write a letter to Chancellor Philip Hammond explaining why inflation was more than a percentage point away from the 2% target. The letter was published alongside the latest inflation report, with Mr Carney saying that rising inflation was ""almost entirely due to the effects of higher import prices that resulted from the depreciation of sterling following the vote to leave the European Union"". He said the rising cost of oil had also added to inflation. Mr Hammond, in reply, said higher inflation had ""squeezed household incomes"" and said that the best way to achieve ""good quality well-paid work for the long term"" was to raise productivity - the measure of how much a worker generates per hour. UK productivity lags behind many other countries with workers in France, for instance, on average producing more in four days than a British worker does in five. Mr Hammond said that ""long-term productivity performance has continued to disappoint"" and that sense was echoed in the inflation report. It said that productivity growth stalled at the start of 2017, and ""remains subdued"", and that productivity still remains ""barely above"" the point it reached prior to the financial crisis a decade ago. The Bank's forecasts also suggested that there is almost no ""slack"" capacity in the UK economy and that unemployment is nearing its so-called equilibrium rate, which some consider to be the lowest rate achievable while maintaining consistent economic growth. It also predicted that wage growth will increase this year to around 3% - another reason why interest rates are likely to go up. The Bank of England previously raised interest rates in November - for the first time since 2007 - from 0.25% to 0.5%."
2018-02-08,"The mother of murdered toddler James Bulger has accused the authorities of ""colluding"" to cover up his killer's behaviour after he was sent back to prison again.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180208145048/https://news.sky.com/story/james-bulgers-killer-jon-venables-jailed-for-possessing-over-1000-abuse-images-11239900,"Jon Venables, who was given lifelong anonymity with a new identity when he was released on licence in 2001, has been jailed after admitting possessing more than 1,000 indecent images of children and a paedophile manual. Mr Justice Edis described the pictures as ""vile"" and ""heartbreaking"", adding that many showed abuse of young boys like James. Police found a total of 1,170 indecent images: 392 judged to be in category A (the most serious), 148 from category B and 630 from category C. Venables, who was sent back to prison in November after he was caught with the pictures, appeared via video link from custody during the hearing at the Old Bailey in London. He was sentenced to three years and four months in prison, with James' parents Denise Fergus and Ralph Bulger in court to see their son's killer learn his fate. Chris Johnson, a spokesman for Ms Fergus, branded the sentence a ""farce"" and said Venables would feel like he had ""got away with it"". He accused the authorities of colluding to cover up Venables' behaviour and called for a public inquiry into the case. Mr Johnson said the disclosure in court that Venables was issued with a caution in 2015 when he gained access to the internet was ""part of a pattern of collusion between Venables and the authorities"". A Ministry of Justice spokesman told Sky News: ""Venables has received a caution by the police for breaching his Sexual Offences Prevention Order in 2015, but there was no evidence at that time of an increased risk to the public that would have justified recall. ""Police arrested Venables very quickly after they discovered his most recent offences, and the conviction he received today is as a direct result of stringent monitoring by the police and probation service. ""He has constantly been subject to stricter licence conditions and more scrutiny than most lifers would be at the same stage of their sentence."" This is the second time Venables has been caught with such material, having been jailed for two years in 2010 after admitting charges of downloading and distributing child abuse images. The court heard that the latest images were of children mainly aged between six and 13, although some were younger. Police found a paedophile manual, aimed at teaching abusers how to have sex with children ""safely"". Prosecutor Louis Mably QC told the court: ""The manual is a disgusting and sickening document which falls far below any recognisable standard of morality."" As he was being taken to a police station, the court that Venables admitted he had ""let people down"" and told officers he had ""stupid urges"". Mr Mably told the Old Bailey that Venables had software on his computer to browse the dark web and admitted downloading the material from there. A report had found that Venables was a ""high risk of real harm to children in the future"" and has a ""long-term and profound interest in children"", the court heard. Mitigating, Edward Fitzgerald QC said: ""He has asked me to apologise to all those he has let down. He apologises to the family of James Bulger for the renewed distress he has caused by his renewed offending."" Venables and his classmate Robert Thompson abducted, tortured and killed two-year-old James in Bootle, Merseyside, in 1993. They were both aged 10 when they committed a crime that shocked the country with its barbarity. Venables was released after serving eight years for the murder and has breached the terms of his licence numerous times since. As well as being caught with abuse images in 2010, Venables was given a formal warning after being arrested on suspicion of affray following a drunken brawl in 2008 and cautioned for possession of cocaine that same year. Mr Fitzgerald told the court Venables' latest ""relapse"" had been swiftly detected, adding: ""Jon Venables still has the capacity for good and a capacity to change."" Sentencing Venables, Mr Justice Edis told him the images he downloaded were ""heartbreaking for any ordinary person to see this kind of material"". He described the manual as a ""vile document"" and told Venables that, as a consumer of these ""products of barbarous evil"", he in turn caused it to happen. The judge added that the offences Venables committed while on licence showed he was a ""manipulative and dishonest"" man. As well as his prison sentence, Venables was also made the subject of a sexual harm prevention order and Mr Justice Edis ordered that his laptop be taken away. Susie Hargreaves, chief executive of the Internet Watch Foundation, said Venables' offending ""brings to light how easily offenders can access this content"" and demonstrates ""why it is so important that these illegal images and videos are removed as quickly as possible"". She added: ""It's vital to remember that every one of these images is of a real child and every time someone views that image the child is revictimised again and again."""

In response, the travel operator is trying to shift demand back towards destinations such as Turkey and Egypt – which have been hit in recent years due to terrorism and political instability. Revenues for the first quarter to the end of December rose 7% to £1.75bn, while underlying losses – during the traditionally tough winter period – narrowed by 19% to £42m. But chief executive Peter Fankhauser said: ""This remains a highly competitive – and, at times, unpredictable – market, as the disruption in the airlines sector in recent months demonstrates."" He said the group continued to see ""significant margin pressure in holidays to Spain, our largest destination, due to higher hotel cost inflation and increased flight capacity"". ""We continue to take actions to help mitigate this, by rebalancing our programme towards higher margin destinations such as Turkey and Egypt, generating efficiencies, and repositioning the business through greater online distribution and an intense focus on sales of holidays to own-brand hotels."" Demand for Thomas Cook's airline rose 8% in the quarter as it carried 3.5 million passengers, and it plans to increase to capacity by 10% over the summer. Mr Fankhauser said: ""While it remains early in our sales cycle, we've got the year off to a good start."" He said it had been helped by ""a particularly strong performance from our group airline, taking advantage of the disruption in the UK and German markets"". Mr Fankhauser added: ""From all that we see so far, customers' appetite for a summer holiday abroad shows no sign of slowing down."" Average selling prices are up 6% for holidays sold in the UK both for the winter and the coming summer seasons, and the company remained on track for full-year forecasts, he said."

The report, published in the BMC Public Health journal found that lower strength wines and beers sold in the UK by Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons were not being actively marketed as alternatives to regular strength products ""and thus may not be promoting healthier drinking habits in consumers"". The study looked at 134 web pages advertising lower strength beers and wines. None contained messages about drinking less, or harm associated with alcohol consumption. Instead, messages describe them as ""lunchtime treats"" or ""perfect for all occasions"", with lower strength beer described as suitable for drinking on additional occasions such as sports events ""to refresh thirsty sportsmen and women"". Report author Dr Milica Vasiljevic said: ""Increased availability of lower strength alcohol products has the potential to reduce alcohol consumption if consumers select these products instead of ones with higher alcohol content. ""If not, they may simply increase the number of occasions on which people drink alcohol. ""Our findings suggest that products containing less alcohol than regular strength wines and beers may be being marketed to replace soft drinks rather than products with higher alcohol content. ""Marketing lower strength alcohol wine and beer as being healthier than regular strength products and suitable for all occasions may paradoxically encourage greater alcohol consumption."""
2018-02-08,Department store chain Debenhams is planning to axe around 320 roles in a store management shake-up.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180208145048/https://news.sky.com/story/debenhams-cutting-320-jobs-in-store-management-shake-up-11240873,"The retailer said it was part of a £10m cost-cutting plan announced last month - when it issued a profits warning after a weak performance over the Christmas period. It aims to redeploy staff affected by the cuts and the changes will not mean any store closures. Debenhams said last year that ten stores were under review for closure if they became unprofitable. Two stores - in Eltham and Farnborough - closed at the end of January under that review, affecting a total of 87 workers. Announcing the latest cuts on Thursday, a spokesperson said the company had ""undertaken a review of our store structure"". ""The review has identified significant cost savings by reducing the complexity of management roles in stores as well as processes to optimise and standardise ways of working. ""The effect is that potentially 320 positions are at risk of redundancy - approximately 25% of store management roles."" ""We are currently consulting with individuals affected and will seek redeployment opportunities where possible. We envisage our new structure being fully in place by the end of March."" The move follows a round of managerial roles going in the supermarket sector, with thousands of posts facing the axe at Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons. Meanwhile, M&S has been rolling out plans to close unprofitable stores, with its latest announcement last month putting 468 jobs at risk. Debenhams said in its Christmas trading update last month that it had been forced to slash prices to boost flagging sales - describing business as ""highly competitive and volatile"". UK retailers have seen tough trading over recent months as consumers are squeezed by higher prices - partly because of the Brexit-induced weakness of the pound - at the same time as weak wage growth."
2018-02-08,Pets shops could be banned from selling puppies to stop dogs being exploited.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180208145048/https://news.sky.com/story/pet-shops-face-puppy-sales-ban-to-protect-dogs-11240820,"Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the Government will look at a ban as part of a package to drive up welfare standards. Breeders will face enhanced licensing conditions later this year as part of the move. Mr Gove said a ban on puppy sales by pet shops and other third party dealers would mean anyone buying or adopting a dog would only be allowed to deal directly with the breeder or an animal rehousing centre. The ban has so far not come in after the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) concluded a ban on third party sales would lead to the creation of an illegal market following evidence from Dogs Trust and Blue Cross. As long as further safeguarding is put in place dog charities have welcomed Mr Gove considering a ban now. It would aim to stop puppies being taken from their mothers too early, being sold to unsuitable homes or being bred so they are unhealthy or have genetic disorders. Third party sellers include anybody selling puppies which they have not bred themselves, such as puppy importers, online sellers and puppy dealers, as by law they must hold a pet shop licence. Paula Boyden, veterinary director for the Dogs Trust, said: ""We are delighted that the Government is exploring a ban on third party puppy sales and implore them to fast track crucial steps before a ban is implemented. ""If a ban was introduced now, puppy farmers could exploit loopholes such as setting themselves up as unregulated re-homing centres or sanctuaries. ""Licensing and inspection of dog breeders and sellers must also be stronger to ensure that everyone involved in the trade is on the radar of local authorities. ""The Government must tackle these loopholes now, so we can be confident a ban will be the success we all want to see."" RSPCA deputy chief executive Chris Wainwright said: ""We are delighted that Defra is considering a ban on third party sales of puppies. ""We believe that cracking down on unscrupulous traders, who put profit ahead of animal welfare, will provide much-needed protection for prospective pet owners and puppies. ""We have always said that an end to third party sales alone would not be enough to end the puppy trade crisis, and we are pleased that this is being looked at alongside enhanced licensing conditions for breeders which will come into force later this year. ""Together, we hope these moves will offer better protection to puppies and their parents and also reduce the number of families duped by rogue traders in this illegal multimillion-pound trade."" Mr Gove said: ""We need to do everything we can to make sure the nation's much loved pets get the right start in life. ""From banning the sale of underage puppies to tackling the breeding of dogs with severe genetic disorders, we are cracking down on sellers who have a total disregard for their dogs' welfare."" Under new rules to take effect later this year, anyone who breeds or sells dogs must be licensed and will be banned from selling puppies and kittens under eight weeks old. They must also show puppies alongside their mother before a sale is made, and sales must be completed in the presence of the new owner in order to prevent online sales where prospective buyers have not seen the animal first. Defra's call for evidence on the ban on third party sales of puppies closes on May 2."
2018-02-08,"MPs accused of sexual harassment will initially have their names kept secret under new measures, Sky News understands.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180208145048/https://news.sky.com/story/westminster-scandal-anonymity-for-mps-accused-of-sexual-harassment-11240735,"In response to a recent scandal, which saw a series of allegations of sexual harassment and bullying made against politicians and staff from across political parties, a cross-party group will publish its final report on Thursday. Sources familiar with Parliament's Working Group on an Independent Complaints and Grievance Policy revealed the group's report will make a number of recommendations. These will include a new behavioural code for all MPs, peers and staff, which will underpin a new independent complaints and grievance procedure separate from the political parties. The group, led by Leader of the House of Commons Andrea Leadsom, will also propose dealing with sexual harassment complaints separately to bullying and harassment claims. Meanwhile, the range of proposed sanctions for offenders will include written apologies, mandatory training and future behaviour agreements. For the worst cases, MPs could even face being kicked out of Parliament by voters, while staff would be dismissed. However, in what is likely to be the most controversial proposal, it is expected the new processes will be confidential for all involved until cases are escalated through the relevant parliamentary bodies. In what are judged to be lesser cases, those accused will have their identity protected until the complaint is finally resolved. For more severe cases, those facing allegations will only be named publicly once the case reaches Parliament's Committee on Standards. A source said: ""It is designed to instil confidence for all involved. You won't have your name splashed in the papers if you make allegations. And you won't have trial by media if you are accused."" The proposal to preserve anonymity for those accused, until they are found guilty of wrongdoing, may prompt fears it will stop other potential victims from coming forward. In some cases, the Westminster scandal saw initial allegations made by one individual encourage other accusers to lodge their own complaints. The plans, to be published through a written ministerial statement on Thursday, will be considered by both the House of Commons and House of Lords with a debate taking place in the last week of February or first week of March. The proposals will be published alongside the results of a survey of all parliamentary workers, which will reveal one in five people working in Westminster experienced sexual harassment in the last 12 months, the Independent website reports. Caroline Lucas, Green Party co-leader and a member of the cross-party working group, hailed the recommendations as ""a blow to patriarchal politics"" and a ""step change for those fighting sexual harassment and bullying in Westminster"". ""I'm pleased that many of the policies I proposed have been adopted - and glad that the group largely overcame party politics to put forward a set of proposals that have the potential to bring about real change,"" she added. ""Although the report doesn't go as far as I would have liked in some areas, I'm proud of the extent to which we have signalled a zero tolerance approach to bullying, harassment and sexual misconduct."""

She was McGowan's manager at the time the actress claims she was raped by movie mogul Weinstein during the Sundance Film Festival in 1997. Last month, Weinstein released alleged correspondence from Ms Messick, in which she wrote that McGowan told her she ""consensually"" got into a Jacuzzi with him. In a statement confirming her death, Ms Messick’s family said she had become ""collateral damage in an already horrific story"". They added that she had opted ""not to add to the feeding frenzy"" and allowed her reputation ""to be sullied despite having done nothing wrong"" after McGowan accused her of failing to support her fight against Weinstein. The family insisted McGowan had reported the alleged incident to her-then manager without calling it rape and Ms Messick informed her bosses, who said they would ""handle the situation"". :: More Weinstein cases go before prosecutor ""Seeing her name in headlines again and again, as part of one person's attempt to gain more attention for her personal cause, along with Harvey's desperate attempt to vindicate himself, was devastating for her,"" Ms Messick’s family said. ""It broke Jill, who was just starting to get her life back on track."" Ms Messick joined Weinstein's film company Miramax as an executive in 1997 and went on to produce films She's All That, Get Over It, Mean Girls, Frida and Baby Mama. The mother-of-two suffered a manic episode five years ago but had ""fought to put her life back together"", her family said. ""Most individuals would be horrified to have their name spotlighted in a major international news story — let alone their photograph,"" the family added. ""We cannot forget that the media is a fearsome tool which cannot be used indiscriminately or even inadvertently to create further victims. ""There is a responsibility when using a platform to accurately expose criminals, predators, mistruths and misdeeds while protecting the actual truth of third parties.""

The incident on Wednesday morning is believed to have been caused by a plane flying overhead. It happened close to Kew Gardens station under a busy flight path into Heathrow. Taxi firm boss Mos Sayed, whose security camera recorded the moment the ice hit the ground, told Sky News: ""When I watched the footage back I was shocked to see it was the size of a boulder. ""It was enormous. It must have been about 20kg. ""It was like the film End Of Days or asteroids falling out of the sky. ""If it had fallen on someone, it would have killed them. ""It's shocking really. I walk along that street with my children every day. ""We should all be grateful no one was severely injured."" The man who was nearly hit by the ice has been named in reports as council worker Serhiy Mysehkov. He told the Richmond and Twickenham Times: ""I was sweeping on the other side of the road, then heard a loud boom. ""It all happened very quickly. I wasn't scared, but it could kill you. I feel lucky."" About 30 ice falls are reported to the UK's aviation regulator each year. It is understood they can be caused by leaks from planes or when ice forms on planes at higher altitudes and breaks off in warmer air. A Civil Aviation Authority spokesman said: ""Ice falls can be as a result of meteorological phenomena, however ice falls from aircraft are considered to be rare in UK airspace. ""The CAA receives reports of around 30 ice falls every year. We are unable to investigate the potential origin of an ice fall, but do record reports of this nature."""
2018-02-09,Mark Carney has put the country on notice - the cost of borrowing is going to rise more rapidly than the Bank of England indicated only three months ago.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180209163608/https://news.sky.com/story/what-the-interest-rates-rise-warning-means-for-you-11241571,"In some ways, this is good news. Interest rates need to go up more quickly than expected because the Bank expects the economy to grow more strongly than expected this year. Unemployment is at its lowest for 43 years and, finally, wages are starting to pick up - as one would expect when the jobless rate is so low. That's the good news. The bad news is that this growth performance is due, in the Monetary Policy Committee's view, mainly because the global economy is growing more strongly than anticipated rather than because of anything we are doing at home. And, because of the UK's mediocre productivity record, the predicted rise in average earnings is, in the MPC's opinion, likely to feed into higher inflation. So the rate needs to go up. This begs the question: when will the Bank next raise the cost of borrowing? The market was putting the chances of an interest rate rise in May at 50/50 even before the Bank's inflation report, but now sees the chance of a rate rise that month as more probable than that, while a rate rise in August - a month after Mr Carney celebrates his fifth anniversary of becoming governor - is seen as a done deal. Even a rise from 0.5% to 0.75% will feed through into higher mortgage rates. Swap rates, which mortgage lenders use to price their fixed-rate home loans, have already been rising with, for example, the two-year rate more than doubling during the last 18 months. So anyone whose fixed-rate home loan is up for renewal before August should be looking right now to lock in the current rates. Likewise, mortgage borrowers on a variable-rate deal might also want to think about moving to a fixed-rate deal. For savers, the decision is less obvious. Many savings accounts are already loss-leaders for banks and building societies and so they are less likely than mortgage lenders to pass on any rise in interest rates. Anyone with both a mortgage and a decent slug of money in a savings account may be better off going for an offset mortgage. And no homeowner should be expecting much of an increase in house prices any time soon. As for investors, this may not necessarily be good news, certainly if their investments are predominantly in the FTSE-100 or funds that track its performance. One big lesson since the Brexit vote is the extent to which the Footsie moves in inverse proportion to the pound, because it is full of big multinationals that make a lot of their sales in dollars and euros, so any drop in the pound flatters those earnings. By the same token, a rise in the pound depresses those earnings in sterling terms, which is partly why Thursday's rise in the pound against both the dollar and the euro has been matched by an almost equal and opposite move in the Footsie. Higher inflation is also the enemy of the bond investor and so anyone with fixed-rate savings accounts, or money in UK gilts, will not welcome Thursday's news. Higher interest rates also mean higher borrowing costs for business, so the already anaemic rate of business investment - something Mr Carney blames for the UK's lacklustre productivity growth - looks set to continue, unless companies can find good and specific reasons to invest. If all that sounds too depressing for words, there is one over-riding reason to be cheerful about what Mr Carney has said today. The UK has just gone through a period, lasting nearly nine years, during which interest rates were held at record low levels. They were kept at those levels because the Bank of England's policy-makers were more frightened about deflation than inflation. That we are now moving - albeit very slowly - to what is a more 'normalised' interest rate environment is undeniably welcome. And one more piece of good news: higher interest rates not only ought to mean higher annuity rates for those coming up for retirement, they should also mean that pension fund deficits (because scheme liabilities are linked to gilt yields) should also, all other things being equal, start to fall. That will be excellent news for companies and, potentially, free up more capital to be invested in profitable activities rather than simply filling in pension deficits."
2018-02-09,"Human eggs have been fully grown in a laboratory setting for the first time, potentially paving the way for new fertility treatments.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180209163608/https://news.sky.com/story/human-eggs-fully-grown-in-lab-for-first-time-ever-11241340,"The eggs were removed from ovary tissue as early as possible and grown in a laboratory up until the point they were ready for fertilisation, according to research published in the journal Molecular Human Reproduction. If the eggs were healthy it could allow women who were undergoing medical treatments that damage their eggs, such as chemotherapy, to store and save them for future fertilisation. However, scientists have cast doubts on whether the study proved that the eggs were fully grown in good health. Lead researcher Professor Evelyn Telfer, of the University of Edinburgh's school of biological sciences, said: ""Being able to fully develop human eggs in the lab could widen the scope of available fertility treatments. ""We are now working on optimising the conditions that support egg development in this way and studying how healthy they are. We also hope to find out, subject to regulatory approval, whether they can be fertilised."" However, not all onlookers agree that the research is so promising. Professor Simon Fishel of the CARE Fertility Group said: ""The press release is perhaps more encouraging than the science or the authors promulgate. ""As has been seen in many attempts to develop human gametes in vitro over the years, what looks normal may not indeed be what we call 'developmentally competent', or indeed healthy."" Professor Daniel Brison, the scientific director of the Department of Reproductive Medicine at University of Manchester, said that it was ""an exciting breakthrough"". He added: ""As the authors acknowledge, there is much more important research still to do, but this could pave the way for fertility preservation in women and girls with a wider variety of cancers than is possible using existing methods."" The study, carried out by the Royal Infirmary Edinburgh, the Centre for Human Reproduction in New York and the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh, was supported by the Medical Research Council."
2018-02-09,NASA has released a record-breaking photograph taken by the New Horizons spacecraft when it was 3.79 billion miles away from the Earth.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180209163608/https://news.sky.com/story/nasa-spacecraft-captures-farthest-ever-image-from-earth-11242261,"New Horizons flew past Pluto in July 2015, taking pictures which revealed an even more diverse landscape than scientists had previously imagined. After the fly-by, the spacecraft continued into the Kuiper Belt - similar to the asteroid belt but further out from the Sun and composed of dwarf planets and frozen ice, rather than rocky bodies. Now, using its Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI), the spacecraft has photographed several Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) and dwarf planets at unique angles. The false-colour images released by NASA are the farthest from Earth ever captured by a spacecraft, and are also the closest-ever images of Kuiper Belt objects. New Horizons was even further away from Earth than the Voyager 1 space probe when it turned towards the Earth on 14 February 1990 and took a picture of a tiny dot. In 1994, US astronomer Carl Sagan reflected on the significance of the photograph to an audience at Cornell University, famously coining its name as the ""Pale Blue Dot"", and giving one of the most widely published speeches of all time. New Horizons is only the fifth man-made spacecraft to ever travel beyond the outer planets, and many of its activities are setting distance records, according to NASA. In December it successfully carried out the most-distant course-correction manoeuvre ever, with the mission team guiding it towards a close-encounter with a KBO scheduled for 1 January 2019. ""That New Year's flight past MU69 will be the farthest planetary encounter in history, happening one billion miles beyond the Pluto system - which New Horizons famously explored in July 2015,"" said NASA. Fortunately, the spacecraft is healthy and functioning properly, although it is currently in hibernation. The mission controllers at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, will bring the spacecraft out of its electronic slumber in June to begin a series of system checkouts and other activities to prepare it for the next record-breaking encounter."
2018-02-09,"Plans for a Brexit transition period have been thrown into doubt by EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier, who says it is ""not a given"" if disagreements persist.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180209163608/https://news.sky.com/story/eu-negotiator-michel-barnier-warns-brexit-transition-period-not-a-given-11242547,"Mr Barnier said time was ""very short"" for both sides to strike a deal to stop a cliff-edge departure on Brexit day. He claimed there were still ""problems"" in Brussels ""understanding the position"" of the British Government. Prime Minister Theresa May this week vowed to be ""robust"" in the face of EU demands, including the continuation of freedom of movement during the transition. Responding, Mr Barnier said: ""I'm surprised by these disagreements and if they persist, a transition is not a given. ""I wasn't talking about a threat. We have to bear in mind what the UK has said. I have some problems understanding the position. They themselves asked for this transition period. ""The EU27 heads of government said yes on the basis of very logical positions. It's understandable. ""But if this disagreement were to persist there will undoubtedly be a problem."" Mr Barnier also tried to defuse a row with David Davis, after the Brexit Secretary fumed that Brussels was ""unwise"" to devise a plan to sanction Britain during the transition. He insisted he had always been objective and calm, and refused to be drawn into a discussion about ""discourteous"" language. The former European Commissioner added there was still no final agreement on the Northern Ireland border issue. ""It is important to tell the truth,"" he cautioned. Mr Barnier said the only option that could be put into the final withdrawal agreement at present was Northern Ireland adopting ""full regulatory alignment"" with the EU. He complained Britain's offer of specific solutions was not yet viable because ""we are waiting for such solutions"". The comments from a media conference in Brussels came at the end of a week of technical talks between both sides' negotiators. There was laughter in the hall as Mr Barnier was asked why the UK was not giving a presentation on Friday on what it wants from the future partnership. ""The time has come to make choices, and we await with great interest the choices,"" he said. Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the comments should come as a ""wake-up call"" to Mrs May. ""With just a few weeks until the March deadline, it's clear the Government is no closer to reaching an agreement,"" he said. ""Theresa May must end the infighting within her Cabinet, drop her reckless red lines and accept Labour's proposals for a transitional deal. ""That means seeking to remain in a customs union with the EU and within the single market during that period. It means we would abide by the common rules of both. ""If the Prime Minister fails to meet Labour's demands then she is putting British jobs and the economy at risk."" Plaid Cymru's Brexit spokesman, Hywel Williams, said: ""If Northern Ireland stays within the EU's single market and customs union, it becomes an economic necessity for Wales to be given the same deal. ""Creating a hard border between Wales and Ireland would put devastating pressure on Wales's external border, and grind our ports to a halt, including the UK's second busiest port in Holyhead."""
2018-02-09,"The terrorists who killed eight people on London Bridge and at Borough Market had taken steroids before the attack, a court has heard.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180209163608/https://news.sky.com/story/london-bridge-attack-terrorists-used-steroids-before-attack-11242524,"Khuram Butt, 27, Rachid Redouane, 30, and Youssef Zaghba, 22, all had high levels of a drug called DHEA in their system, according to a toxicologist speaking at a pre-inquest hearing at the Old Bailey. The presence of the hormone pill, which can be bought over the counter, was said to be ""above the physiological range"", suggesting it was used in the period from several hours to days beforehand. A natural supplement, it is widely believed to improve sex drive and help build muscle. There is little medical evidence to support these claims. The London attack, which took place on 3 June last year, began when the men drove a white van into pedestrians on the bridge. They then stabbed victims with 12-inch knives in the nearby market. The entire attack lasted eight minutes. The eight people killed were Londoner James McMullan, 32; Canadian Christine Archibald, 30; Frenchmen Xavier Thomas, 45, Alexandre Pigeard, 26, and Sebastien Belanger, 36; Australians Kirsty Boden, 28, and Sara Zelenak, 21; and Spaniard Ignacio Echeverria, 39. At least 50 others were injured in the atrocity. All three attackers, who were wearing false suicide belts to ""create maximum fear"", were shot and killed by police at the scene. Inquests into the deaths of the victims and the attackers - which will be held separately - will begin early next year. Police, security services, fire and ambulance services will attend the inquests, as well as the families of both the victims and attackers. The extent of MI5 knowledge of one of the attackers - ringleader Khuram Butt who was under active investigation by the agency - will form part of the inquiry. Around 1,800 witness statements have been taken in advance of the inquests. Lawyer Victoria Ailes, representing five of the victims' families, said anyone who had CCTV footage or mobile phone film of the attacks should come forward. Chief Coroner Mark Lucraft QC said anyone wishing to remain anonymous - including families of the attackers - will need to make requests ahead of the inquest. The use of drugs in the attack - which was London's third deadly terrorist incident in just three months - echoes Westminster attacker Khalid Masood, who is understood to have taken anabolic steroids in the hours or days before his death."
2018-02-09,"The Government has stepped up action to crack down on unpaid internships, sending out more than 550 warning letters in an attempt to stamp out the practice.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180209163608/https://news.sky.com/story/government-action-to-stamp-out-exploitative-unpaid-internships-11242337,"It is issuing guidance to employers spelling out when they are legally obliged to pay at least the minimum wage. HM Revenue and Customs is expected to target sectors such as the media, the performing arts, the law and accountancy firms, the Guardian reported. Business minister Andrew Griffiths said: ""Employing unpaid interns as workers to avoid paying the National Minimum Wage is against the law and exploitative. ""No-one should feel like they have to work for free to get the skills and experience they need to get ahead. ""That's why over the last three months Government enforcement teams have been targeting employers advertising for unpaid interns, reminding them of the law and the consequences of breaking it."" Campaigners say internships are increasingly seen as a requirement before a first job in one of the top professions and that the high costs associated with these are shutting many less advantaged people out of careers. The Sutton Trust estimates that there are around 70,000 internships offered each year and that 10,000 graduates are in internships six months after graduation. It has found that more than 40% of young people who have carried out such a placement has done at least one of them unpaid. The Trust estimated last month that rising rents and inflation mean an unpaid internship now costs a single person living in London at least £1,019 a month, with a cost of £827 in Manchester. It says that the law is currently not being properly enforced and wants to see rules tightened. The Government said earlier this week that it accepted the recommendations of the Downing Street commissioned Taylor review that ""exploitative unpaid internships, which damage social mobility in the UK, are stamped out"". It said: ""We will take action to improve the interpretation of the law and the enforcement action taken by HMRC in this area. ""An employer cannot avoid paying someone the minimum wage simply by calling them an 'intern' or saying that they are doing an internship."" However, defining someone as a worker depended on multiple factors including whether they were expected to turn up for work each day, and ""genuine volunteers"" were not entitled to the minimum wage, the Government said."
2018-02-09,A black box locked away in solitude beneath the world's driest desert in northern Chile could be vital in the search for alien life.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180209163608/https://news.sky.com/story/black-box-beneath-desert-could-hold-key-to-discovering-alien-life-11242465,"The box is the most precise scientific instrument of its kind ever built; more than 10 times stronger than the most powerful spectrograph in operation today. Nicknamed ""Espresso"", it will be connected to a facility of four telescopes so massive they are collectively referred to simply as the Very Large Telescope (VLT), where it will scan the skies for planets beyond our solar system. In silence, buried beneath the facility on the Paranal mountain in the Atamaca desert, the black box will analyse the wobble in distant stars to see if that wobble was caused by an Earth-like planet orbiting it. Espresso, which stands for Echelle Spectrograph for Rocky Exoplanet and Stable Spectroscopic Observations, will analyse the light from distant stars that the VLT detects. Analysing this light, it will discover the quality of their atmosphere and whether those atmospheres have oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide, as well as if they contain water; the essential ingredients for life. ""Espresso will be available on all four telescopes at once, which is something that had never been done before. That means the likelihood of finding planets similar to Earth in mass and size, or the conditions for life, are greater,"" according to Italian astronomer Gaspare Lo Curto. The Atamaca desert is so dry that its skies are almost always cloudless - which is why the European Southern Observatory established its telescopes there. The location is so well-suited to star gazing that it is expected by 2020 that the Atacama will house around 70% of the entire planet's astronomy infrastructure. Espresso will be 10 times more precise than the most precise instrument in the world currently engaging in a similar search, the HARPS (High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher) instrument. HARPS was only able to measure planets far larger than Earth, which are very unlikely to host life. Espresso ""will help us answer one of the greatest questions we have in astronomy, which is analysing and understanding planets outside our solar system,"" Chilean astronomer Rodrigo Herrera Camus said. The technology that Espresso is based on is so delicate it needs to be stored at an extremely cold temperature. It will live inside a giant metal cylinder kept on average at -150 C, locked in an underground bunker beneath the VLT, away from any human visitors for at least a decade."
2018-02-09,Elise Christie is a World Champion short track speed skater who suffered humiliation and misery when she was disqualified three times at the Sochi Winter Olympics.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180209163608/https://news.sky.com/story/speed-skating-star-elise-christie-for-me-its-all-about-winning-11240212,"Here, she explains how she's put her failure behind her and how she will be approaching the Pyeongchang Games so she can go home this time with her head held high. I'm so excited. It's been four years of torture since Sochi and turning it all around. I've had some amazing performances that I wish had been in the Olympics. Just to get out there in a few days will be so good. I can't believe it's here now. You wait so long and it's suddenly here. It's not redemption because for me the World Championships was my redemption. It is the hardest thing you can do in short track, become a World Champion. For me it's more about me giving back to everyone who helped me through Sochi – UK Sport, the team around me, the public, the media – everyone who supported me through that bad time. Winning an Olympic medal would be something they can see as well and I'd love to give back to everyone who's helped me through that. Pressure comes with every part of this sport. It's such a hard sport to get right so I feel pressure every time I race. But it is pressure because I just want to do well for everyone. I feel less pressure on myself, I guess, because my dream goal was always to be World Champion and I did that. So for me, this is all about the pressure from everyone else. I want to do well for them. The experience last time definitely changed me. I've gone from being someone who used to risk everything to win, to someone who started accepting medals and not accepting failure and just holding back a bit. And I'm now back to that person who just wants to win. So for me it'll be all about trying to win. So, if that means a penalty, if that means a mess up, then I'd rather go home from the Olympics knowing that I did everything I could, than come back with a bronze medal that I've settled for. So, I've learned to accept failure and I think that makes you race much better because you are not scared of failing, you are just thinking about winning. So, I've changed a lot since Sochi. In Pyeongchang, in South Korea, I think some people might see me as public enemy number one but it's not like that, they just love the sport. They are passionate about it so they boo, they cheer, they are so animated. It's such a nice feeling to be part of that. If anything, out there, you are like a celebrity. They are just really excited to get close to you. They scream when you are near them. I think it will be so much fun out there. It'll be not just like a short track race, it'll be like a performance in front of everyone. I'm all for clean sport. I support it 100%, but for me I'm not really paying attention to what's going on with the Russia ban. It's for the Russians to deal with and I just want to go out and race whoever is put in front of me and beat them and that for me is what's important. That's all I'm caring about."

It was recorded in an EU memo and reported in Friday's Daily Telegraph. But a spokesperson for Mr Corbyn talked down the claim. They said: ""Jeremy did not say he was open to staying in the customs union. He said that a customs union was a viable end point. ""We have been clear all the way through that you can't be in the customs union if you are not in the EU."" All member states are by default part of the EU's customs union. That is the system which permits goods trading without customs checks inside the bloc. In exchange, countries agree universal tariffs being on goods being imported from outside the EU. Mr Corbyn has acknowledged the UK will automatically leave the customs union on Brexit day - expected to be 29 March 2019. But Labour wants the current terms of the customs union to be replicated during the transition period. And it is leaving the door open on forming a new customs union with the EU in the future In contrast, Prime Minister Theresa May earlier this week ruled out the UK joining any form of customs union with the EU after Brexit. Mr Barnier is due to give a media conference on this week's technical negotiations later on Friday."

The Londoners were the last members of a group of four Britons who are believed to have tortured and beheaded dozens of people. The group, which also included ""Jihadi John"" Mohammed Emwazi and Aine Davis, was nicknamed The Beatles by hostages because their English accents set them apart from other foreign fighters. :: Who are the IS fighters nicknamed 'The Beatles'? Nicolas Henin, a French journalist who was held captive by Islamic State for 10 months, said the time had come for real justice. He told Sky News: ""They were part of a group of four British jihadis that we nicknamed 'The Beatles', as they were, especially at the end of my captivity, responsible for us as a group of about two dozen western hostages."" He continued: ""This is the beginning of a process that will bring them eventually, hopefully, to a trial. Justice is just what I want. ""Guantanamo is a denial of justice. Guantanamo was opened 16 years ago. There hasn't been a single trial there. ""What I want is a trial and a trial potentially that I can attend, so rather, a trial in London rather than one in Kobani in northern Syria,"" he added. Ringleader Emwazi was killed in a drone strike in 2015 and Davis is in jail in Turkey after being convicted last year on terrorism charges. Kotey and Elsheikh were captured in early January by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces. Relatives of some of the cell's other alleged victims echoed Mr Henin's call for the pair to face trial. Bethany Haines, whose father David was killed in 2014 after being held captive for 18 months, said she hoped the pair's detention could bring some closure for bereaved families. In a post on Facebook and Instagram, she said: ""It's brilliant that these evil people have been caught. The families will now have people to hold account for their loved ones death. No punishment is enough for these barbarians and in my opinion they should be sentenced to a slow painful death."" US officials have pledged to hold the terrorists accountable, with a Defence Department spokesman adding that they were ""still considering options"" for what to do with the pair. ""We are still considering options regarding el-Sheikh and Kotey, but rest assured our intention is to hold anyone accountable who commits acts like those they are alleged to have committed,"" said Major Adrian Rakine-Galloway. He confirmed they are being held in a ""detention location"" in Syria but said he could not give any further information. The arrests reportedly took place in the Deir ez-Zur region in the north east of Syria, towards the Iraq border. Elsheikh, 29, and Kotey, 34, both came from London and are said to have earned a reputation for engaging in Islamic State's ""exceptionally cruel torture methods"", including waterboarding. Kotey was a recruiter for the terror group and was responsible for enlisting several UK nationals."

He got victims to film or photograph themselves, then blackmailed them into carrying out even more depraved acts. Falder, public school-educated and a star student at Cambridge University, has admitted 137 charges involving 46 victims. His catalogue of crimes included fitting secret cameras in a public toilet, the bathrooms of his friends and his parents' home, sharing the images with others. Prosecutor Ruona Iguyovwe has spent two days outlining the charges Falder has admitted, warning a packed courtroom that much of the detail would be upsetting. He persuaded one young victim to lick a toilet seat and a used tampon and eat dog food, she told a judge at Birmingham Crown Court. Others were urged to perform even more humiliating acts, threatening to expose their previous acts to their families and friends if they refused. A young American man who told Falder he was contemplating suicide was warned that he would still be exposed after his death. Falder engaged potential victims on marketplace websites such as Gumtree, then began a dialogue in which he lured them onto encrypted websites. His expert knowledge of the dark web and his use of 70 different online identities meant he was almost impossible to unmask. Investigators at the National Crime Agency consulted specialists at Government spy centre GCHQ, the US Department of Homeland Security and the FBI, before they tracked down Falder. He was arrested last summer at Birmingham University, where he was working as a researcher after finishing a doctorate at Cambridge. Fellow Cambridge students, friends and his girlfriend were among his unsuspecting victims, many of whom described him as ""clever and great fun"". Falder's crimes include sexually exploiting children, encouraging rape, possessing indecent images of children, blackmail and voyeurism. His lawyer is expected to speak for him on Friday morning, though his sentence is likely to be postponed for a couple of weeks. He faces life in prison."
2018-02-09,The Bank of England has signalled that interest rates are to rise sooner than previously thought as it upgraded forecasts for UK growth.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180209163608/https://news.sky.com/story/bank-of-england-holds-interest-rates-at-05-11241172,"Rate-setters unanimously voted to leave rates on hold for now at 0.5% but gave new guidance on their future path - sending the pound up by nearly two cents against the US dollar to almost $1.41. Just before 6pm, however, it had fallen slightly to $1.39. The Bank's upgrade for UK growth in its quarterly inflation report comes as the global economy expands more quickly than expected. It said that monetary policy would now ""need to be tightened somewhat earlier and by a somewhat greater extent"" than it had previously predicted. The Bank's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee is now predicting that its base rate will reach 1.2% by the start of 2021, a figure that would almost certainly require three separate rate rises. Market predictions are that the first of these may come as early as May. The prospect of higher rates continues the slow drift away from an era of easy, cheap money, which has been in place since the financial crisis nearly ten years ago. It has helped sustain a period of consumer spending, but has also left many savers with meagre returns on their investments. The Bank has upgraded its predictions for the growth of the UK economy, forecasting an expansion of 1.7% in 2018 rather than the 1.5% it had previously pencilled in. It thinks that will be followed by growth of 1.8% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020. Almost all of this improvement has been ascribed to the health of the global economy, which is growing faster than originally thought. ""Notwithstanding recent volatility in financial markets, global financial conditions remain supportive,"" say the committee minutes. ""UK net trade is benefiting from robust global demand and the past depreciation of sterling."" The committee said, however, that it was ""an important judgment"" as to how much the UK would benefit from booming economies in other countries, bearing in mind ""continuing Brexit-related uncertainties"". Indeed, the committee's minutes show clearly that Brexit remains its most pressing worry. Despite writing that ""households and companies base their decisions on the expectation of a smooth adjustment to that new trading relationship"", the minutes also describe the effects of Brexit negotiations as ""the most significant influence on, and source of uncertainty about, the economic outlook"". Bank of England governor Mark Carney said: ""The economic outlook will continue to evolve. There will be ups and downs in financial markets. The Brexit process will twist and turn before it is concluded."" The Bank is predicting that inflation will gradually fall back from its present rate of 3% over the course of the coming three years. It touched 3.1% in November, compelling Mr Carney to write a letter to Chancellor Philip Hammond explaining why inflation was more than a percentage point away from the 2% target. The letter was published alongside the latest inflation report, with Mr Carney saying that rising inflation was ""almost entirely due to the effects of higher import prices that resulted from the depreciation of sterling following the vote to leave the European Union"". He said the rising cost of oil had also added to inflation. Mr Hammond, in reply, said higher inflation had ""squeezed household incomes"" and said that the best way to achieve ""good quality well-paid work for the long term"" was to raise productivity - the measure of how much a worker generates per hour. UK productivity lags behind many other countries with workers in France, for instance, on average producing more in four days than a British worker does in five. Mr Hammond said that ""long-term productivity performance has continued to disappoint"" and that sense was echoed in the inflation report. It said that productivity growth stalled at the start of 2017, and ""remains subdued"", and that productivity still remains ""barely above"" the point it reached prior to the financial crisis a decade ago. The Bank's forecasts also suggested that there is almost no ""slack"" capacity in the UK economy and that unemployment is nearing its so-called equilibrium rate, which some consider to be the lowest rate achievable while maintaining consistent economic growth. It also predicted that wage growth will increase this year to around 3% - another reason why interest rates are likely to go up. The Bank of England previously raised interest rates in November - for the first time since 2007 - from 0.25% to 0.5%."
2018-02-09,"Children have been told not to hide in department stores as part of an online craze, with police warning the consequences could be ""catastrophic"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180209163608/https://news.sky.com/story/24-hour-challenge-shop-sleepover-craze-could-be-catastrophic-11242316,"The ""24 Hour Challenge"" encourages people to hide and build forts in large shops and warehouses overnight, before sneaking out the next morning. In one case, Abid Mirza from Sheffield said he went through a ""very rough time"" when his 11-year-old son allegedly spent the night in an Ikea. Detective Inspector Anna Sedgwick from South Yorkshire Police said the risk and harm that could be caused by taking part in the challenge are ""by no means humorous and could be catastrophic"". DI Sedgwick added: ""Warehouses and shopping departments contain large quantities of heavy stock and items that could easily fall and crush someone if they are moved incorrectly, or used to build makeshift forts. ""As well as the safety risk, children often do this without the knowledge of their parents, which could lead to large-scale searches or even cause them to be reported as missing. ""This not only causes fear and worry for parents, friends, family and the local community but can also be a waste of valuable police time, which may be needed to respond to a life or death situation."" She said the force is working with schools to raise awareness of the craze and appealed to parents to speak to their children about it. ""A few words of advice could save your youngsters life,"" DI Sedgwick added. Ikea warned teenagers in 2016 to stop sneaking into its stores for illegal sleepovers following a spate of incidents in Britain, the US, Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, Japan, Australia and Poland. The Swedish firm said trespassers often hid in wardrobes at closing time and warned anyone attempting the stunt that they could face arrest. Two Belgian YouTubers have been credited with starting the craze with their video of a 12-hour stay in a store, which has been viewed more than two million times. The pair filmed themselves jumping on beds and reading bedtime stories before hiding in a wardrobe and leaving undetected after the store reopened."

But undeterred by the incident at Manhattan Federal Court, the juror insisted she wanted to remain on the jury. According to the newspaper, she told the judge: ""He just said, 'Hi, Sylvia', and I just turned my head, like, 'Some nerve'."" Asked by the judge if the exchange would affect her ability to remain on the case, she replied: ""No, not at all."" The judge told Merlino, who denied he spoke to the woman, ""to have no contact with jurors, even to say, 'Good morning', even to say, 'Hello'."" Merlino is accused of orchestrating a health care fraud that made a fortune for an East Coast crime syndicate. He was arrested in a 2016 crackdown on the syndicate along with dozens of others who were alleged to have committed crimes including extortion, loan-sharking, casino-style gambling, sports gambling, credit card fraud and health care fraud. The syndicate is said to have operated in New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Florida and New Jersey. Merlino was granted bail after paying a bond of $5m (£3.6m). He denies the charges against him and says he retired from the mob for good when he opened an Italian restaurant in Boca Raton in Florida called Merlino's."

2018-02-09,Team GB have sent their biggest-ever contingent to the Winter Olympics - 59 athletes will compete in Pyeongchang and the target of five medals is the biggest they've ever been set.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180209163608/https://news.sky.com/story/which-britons-have-pyeongchang-winter-olympic-medal-hopes-11239993,"But no, it's not unrealistic. Short track speed skater Elise Christie is the poster girl of the games for GB - a sort of Jess Ennis on skates. Having been disqualified from all three of her races in Sochi four years ago, these games couldn't come soon enough. She bounced back with three golds at the World Championships but the Olympics are still the pinnacle. Plus, in South Korea her event is a national sport - in Pyeongchang the 27-year-old Scot will be a big celebrity. Despite the ""torture"" of the last four years, she has vowed to go for gold and not play safe, and if that means another disaster then so be it. Slopestyle skier James Woods is also a strong medal contender with a point to prove. He broke his hip before Sochi in 2014, proof that this is an event where things can go very badly wrong. But he's a gambler, will go for difficulty and believes he can win gold - not bad for a lad who learned to ski on a dry slope in Sheffield. Katie Summerhayes also learned her trade in Sheffield and finished 7th in Sochi. Both she and 19-year-old Izzy Atkin will have chances to finish in the medals but the slopestyle course in Pyeongchang is a particularly challenging one. Sadly, snowboarder Katie Ormerod, who had been tipped to be a star of these games, has had to pull out. Reigning Olympic skeleton champion Lizzy Yarnold is aiming to be the first woman to defend this Olympic title in an event where Great Britain's women have ruled the roost. But, after a year-long sabbatical, getting married and dealing with dizzy spells caused by an inner ear problem, she will have to put in her best performances of the season to do that. The men's four-man bobsleigh team could yet end up with a bronze from Sochi due to failed Russian dope tests and they are strong contenders again. Skier Dave Ryding achieved Britain's best ever finish in a World Cup last year when he claimed slalom silver and Nordic cross country/jump skier Andrew Musgrave from Poole is in the form of his life. Not forgetting both the men's and women's curling teams. Four years ago the men took silver and the women bronze. Eve Muirhead's women's team is virtually unchanged, so could they sweep away the gold this time? The GB skipper, whose two brothers are also competing here, may feel it is her destiny."
2018-02-09,A fraudster who pretended that his family died in the Grenfell Tower fire to get money from a victims fund has been jailed.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180209163608/https://news.sky.com/story/grenfell-tower-fire-fraudster-anh-nhu-nguyen-jailed-for-21-months-11242888,"Appearing at Southwark Crown Court, Anh Nhu Nguyen was sentenced to 21 months in prison for defrauding more than £10,000 from charities and the local council. Nguyen claimed his wife and son died in the tragedy and was pictured shaking hands with the Prince of Wales when he met survivors. The man even spoke to Sky News at the time of the disaster and described the ""shock"" of ""seeing dead bodies"". ""The last time I saw my son and wife was on the 12th floor,"" he said during an interview. ""It (the smoke) was like snow, like fog, you can't see. It was too dark to see. You can't see anything. I couldn't breathe. I was like that - like I got a heart attack for 20 minutes."" At his sentencing, the 53-year-old, of Beckenham, southeast London, showed no emotion as he learned his fate. Judge Philip Bartle QC said Nguyen knew ""full well"" what the consequences of his actions were. ""I do not accept that the acts were in some way an attempt to be part of a community and that you were in some way reaching out in order to be embraced by that community,"" he said. ""I am sure from everything I have seen... that despite your low IQ you knew full well what you were doing. ""You knew that you were taking advantage of these genuine victims at this terrible time of this terrible tragedy."" The court heard that Nguyen recalled to family liaison officers how he lost sight of his family in a smoke-clogged stairwell. But the prosecution said while a major recovery operation was under way the day after the deadly blaze, Nguyen was nine miles away at a housing charity. Defence barrister Keima Payton told the court that a report prepared by a psychologist found Nguyen had an ""astonishingly low"" IQ that put him in the bottom 2.5% of people in Britain. It found that he was suffering from ""long-term, untreated post-traumatic stress disorder"", depression and low empathy. Part of the reason why Nguyen acted the way he did was to ""feel part of a group, to be looked after, wanted and welcome"", the report concluded. Nguyen received around £11,270 from charities and Kensington and Chelsea Council, the court heard. The defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud by false representation and one count of making an untrue statement for the purpose of obtaining a passport at a previous hearing in November. Nguyen was born in Vietnam and came to the UK in the 1980s. The British citizen had 17 aliases, the court heard. He has 28 previous convictions for 56 offences over more than 30 years, including theft, dishonesty offences, arson and grievous bodily harm."
2018-02-09,"EU migrants should not be given preferential access to Britain after Brexit in order to give all people ""equal chance"" to come to the UK, according to leading Brexiteer Andrea Leadsom.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180209163608/https://news.sky.com/story/andrea-leadsom-backs-level-playing-field-for-post-brexit-immigration-11241742,"The Leader of the House of Commons told Sky News she wanted to see a ""level playing field"" between those from the EU and the rest of the world once the UK leaves the EU. Her comments come amid reports a key Cabinet sub-committee is considering this as a post-Brexit option for the UK's new immigration system. ""It is right that once we have left the EU we are back in change of our immigration rules again,"" Ms Leadsom said. ""I would certainly like to see a level playing field for all the people around the world, the brightest and the best, to make a contribution to the UK. ""To have a level playing field so they will all have an equal chance of coming here to make their life here and contribute to our society and our economy."" The Tory minister's remarks follow a report in The Times newspaper that Theresa May's top Brexit adviser, senior civil servant Olly Robbins, proposed two post-Brexit immigration systems at this week's meeting of the Cabinet sub-committee. It has been claimed the system offering no preferential treatment for EU migrants found favour with ministers. Ms Leadsom, who challenged Mrs May for the Conservative leadership in 2016, told Sky News she thought the Prime Minister was doing a ""superb job of balancing very strongly held views"" on the Tory benches and across the House of Commons. She also implored her party colleagues to get behind the Prime Minister after a febrile start to the year. ""The Prime Minister is treading that fine line doing a great job and showing a huge commitment to it and I sincerely hope that all of the party continues to support her in that role,"" Ms Leadsom said. The Cabinet discussions on post-Brexit immigration systems come as the Government postponed plans for an immigration bill until the autumn, prompting a backlash from business and MPs. The bill had been pencilled to come to the House of Commons in January, with a white paper originally promised last summer. It will now not be released until after a transition deal with the EU is agreed, pencilled in for March. Yvette Cooper, chair of the House of Commons' Home Affairs Select Committee, described the situation as a ""shambles"" in an urgent question in Parliament this week. ""We know that the Prime Minister wants people arriving after March 2019 to be treated differently, but we have no idea how,"" said the former shadow home secretary. ""It is just not good enough keeping Parliament in the dark in this way."" Ms Cooper added: ""At best, ministers are cutting Parliament and the public out of the crucial debate about the future of our country. ""At ​worst, they seem to be stuck in negotiations without having agreed, even among themselves, what they want to achieve out of them."" In response, immigration minister Caroline Nokes said an immigration white paper would be published ""in the coming months""."
2018-02-09,The remains of at least six people have been recovered from plant pots in the grounds of a property connected to an alleged serial killer in Canada.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180209163608/https://news.sky.com/story/canada-serial-killer-remains-of-at-least-six-people-found-in-plant-pots-11242239,"The discovery was made by Toronto police officers at a home Bruce McArthur used as storage in return for doing the landscaping. Detective Sergeant Hank Idsinga said the remains included some from Andrew Kinsman, one of the five men McArthur is already charged with killing. The freelance landscaper was arrested last month and charged with two counts of murder in connection with the disappearances of Mr Kinsman and Selim Esen, who were last seen in the ""Gay Village"" district of Toronto. Shortly afterwards, McArthur was charged with the murders of three more men. Police say they are still searching for other possible victims and expect to find more remains in the more than a dozen ""planters"" that have been retrieved from around the city. Investigators are still trying to determine who the other alleged victims are from the property. At least 30 other places have been checked, including locations in some of Toronto's wealthiest neighbourhoods where McArthur was known to have worked. Part of the lawn at the home where the new remains were found is also being excavated. A large tent has been set up to stop the ground from freezing and a forensic anthropologist was seen arriving at the property on Thursday. Police have not revealed extensive details about the case, but McArthur is believed to have met his alleged victims while driving around the city in the van he used for work and on gay dating apps for older and large men, using names such as ""SilverDaddies"" and ""Bear411"". McArthur described himself in his profile as 5ft 10in and more than 15 stone (221 pounds) and mostly interested in younger men. ""I can be a bit shy until I get to know you, but am a romantic at heart,"" he wrote. McArthur posted pictures of his cats, children and grandchildren on his Facebook page, as well as an image of himself dressed as Santa Claus. Edward Royle, a lawyer for McArthur, has so far declined to comment. McArthur is next due in court on 14 February and is yet to enter a plea. The other three known victims are 58-year-old Majeed Kayhan, who disappeared in 2012, Soroush Marmudi, 50, who went missing in 2015, and Dean Lisowick, who vanished between May 2016 and July 2017. According to police, Mr Lisowick, who was in his 40s, was homeless and had not been reported missing. Mr Kinsman, 49, and Mr Esen, 44, both went missing between April and June last year. Police are looking at hundreds of missing person cases to determine if they were potential victims of McArthur. They are also chasing up tips that have come in from around the world and are ""dealing with some agencies overseas"", Mr Idsinga said."

The 51-year-old suspect, who is related to the girl, is also in hospital receiving treatment for a cut hand. A woman in her 80s suffered a suspected dislocated shoulder during the incident. Superintendent Harvi Khatkar said: ""This is an extremely distressing incident and our sympathies go out to everyone affected. ""We are working to establish exactly what has happened, and fully understand the impact that this will have on the community. ""But we do believe this is an isolated incident, and we are not looking for anyone else. ""Extra officers will be out patrolling the area to offer reassurance to residents."" The house has been cordoned off to allow forensic experts to conduct an examination. A post-mortem examination is expected to take place on Sunday. West Midlands Police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident. One neighbour, who knew of the schoolgirl, described her as ""always smiling"". Anyone with information can call police on 101, quoting log 77 of 9 February."

First aiders tried to save her life and attempted CPR but she died at the scene shortly before midnight on Wednesday. Police are investigating. Olivia had joined the university in October and was studying natural sciences. Witnesses described how she became trapped under a fence as students queued to get into the club, before doormen tried to resuscitate her. One witness, who did not want to be named, told the Northern Echo: ""People were barging to get in. The queue has gone around the fence and as they pushed to get in it caused the fence to fall over. ""The girl was trapped under the fence and crushed. There was a fair bit of panic."" The witness said a bouncer took his shirt off to stem the bleeding from the victim's head before delivering CPR with his colleagues. North East Ambulance Service confirmed CPR was already being given to the woman when its crews arrived at the scene. In a statement, Missoula said it was ""a terrible accident"" and that they were working with the police and security company which provides door staff. Professor David Held, Master of University College, Durham, said the staff and students ""acutely feel the loss of Olivia Burt"". ""Olivia arrived in Durham last autumn to begin reading natural sciences. She came to Durham with glowing references from her school where she was regarded in the highest possible terms,"" Professor David Held said. ""She had an outstanding academic record and was an exceptional sports woman. She was part of the British sailing team in the European Championships. Olivia sailed for more than a decade, quickly finding her place in the university team. She became very active both in college life and the wider university. ""Those students close to her have lost a wonderful friend, whom in their shock they grieve for, alongside her family and friends. ""The college has lost a bright and outstandingly able student. It is hard to come to terms with her loss, and we will miss her greatly."" Detective Superintendent Kevin Weir said: ""This was a tragic incident and our thoughts are with the family and friends of Olivia during this incredibly sad time. ""A joint investigation is ongoing between ourselves and Durham County Council to establish the circumstances surrounding the incident."" Missoula advertises its Game Over event on Wednesday as Durham's biggest student night. It is in the popular Walkergate area in the city centre, where there are a host of bars and restaurants."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its second biggest fall in history on Thursday, with the decline of 1,032 points only surpassed by the drop of 1,175 witnessed on Monday. This placed the index into what is known as the correction phase, when there is a drop of more than a tenth. US stock market futures were pointing to a calmer opening on Wall Street later. Despite this week's turbulence, global markets are still close to historically high levels. Analysts have also pointed out that corrections of this kind are normal. The US stock market began its current wobble last Friday after strong wages and jobs figures suggested inflation could increase and the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates too quickly. Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said: ""Far and away the most important things are the fear that the Fed is going to make a mistake, and higher wages are going to cut into margins."" The Bank of England also spooked investors on Thursday by signalling that interest rates are likely to rise earlier and more sharply than previously thought. The FTSE 100 Index is on track to register a drop of 4% over the week. In Asia this morning, Shanghai stocks plunged 4% while Japan's Nikkei Index fell 2.3% and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong dropped 3.1%"

The glasses were attached to the eyes of the insects by beeswax, with the mantises suspended upside down in front of a computer screen showing 3D footage of prey. :: Praying mantises given 3D specs by scientists The insects would try to catch the prey, so the researchers subjected them to vision tests typically given to people to try and determine how the mantises reach their 3D perception. With humans, each eye sees a slightly different view of the world. The brain merges those two images to create one, which helps us work out the distance to objects. People and animals including monkeys, cats, horses and owls compare the brightness of the two images to visualise 3D space. This process is known as stereo vision, or stereopsis. But mantises focus on where the brightness is actively changing between the two images, allowing them to tell the distance to their target even when it is camouflaged against a similar background, the study found. Vivek Nityananda, lead author of the study, said: ""This is a completely new form of 3D vision, as it is based on change over time instead of static images. ""In mantises, it is probably designed to answer the question 'Is there prey at the right distance for me to catch?'"" Professor Jenny Read, of the university's institute of neuroscience, said she believes the research could have a wider impact in automation. She said: ""Reducing the amount of computer power necessary means smaller, lightweight robots could use mantis stereo algorithms to detect depth."" Mantis cannot see in 3D if the image is static, but their visual technique means they can detect distance to a moving object better than humans under certain circumstances, including when there is a difference in brightness between images from both eyes, according to the study. The findings were published online on Friday in the journal Current Biology."

The interruption came five minutes into their shoot with photographer Annie Crossman, who said the officers had the awareness to shout ""congratulations"" from their car window as the vehicles went by. Other officers pursued the suspect on foot, with some making their way back to greet the loved-up couple and have pictures taken with them once the drama had come to an end. Mrs Eyre said: ""We had the best time! Such a surreal story on our wedding day."" Not only did the officers ensure Mr and Mrs Eyre would have a truly unique wedding day album to treasure, their efforts also resulted in two arrests.

Trinity Mirror will pay an initial £47.7m in cash to Richard Desmond's Northern & Shell group, £59m to be paid between 2020 and 2023, plus shares worth £20m. It will also put a one-off payment of £41.2m into the publisher's pension scheme and has agreed a plan for further top-ups totalling £29.2m up to 2027. The company already publishes the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror, Sunday People and Daily Record as well as being the UK's biggest regional newspaper owner. Trinity Mirror chief executive Simon Fox said: ""This deal is a really exciting moment in Trinity Mirror's history, combining some of the most iconic titles in the UK media industry. ""It is good for our readers, good for our customers and good for our shareholders. Northern and Shell's titles have a large and loyal readership, a growing digital presence and a stable revenue mix and offer an excellent fit with Trinity Mirror."" The deal is expected to deliver £20m in annual cash savings by 2020, and enhance earnings for Trinity Mirror in the first full year of ownership. Confirmation of the transaction confirms an exclusive story by Sky News at the weekend. Trinity Mirror said Northern & Shell's publishing assets had performed well last year despite continued pressure on advertising revenues, thanks to online income and the partial reversing of cover price discounts. It said underlying earnings were £34m ""benefiting from operational and strategic reductions in printing and production, marketing and other operating costs"". Mr Desmond, who acquired the newspaper titles in 2000 for £125m, said: ""The Express Newspapers and our celebrity magazine titles have been a key part of the Northern & Shell portfolio for many years, and I am immensely proud of building them into one of the largest newspaper and magazine groups in the UK. ""Today's transformational transaction is a logical and natural next step in the evolution and consolidation of the media sector and will create a larger and stronger platform serving all stakeholders. ""In Trinity Mirror we have a great partner, who will be an excellent steward of the business going forward and I am delighted to be able to retain an ongoing interest in the combined group."" Mr Desmond has made hundreds of ‎millions of pounds from his ownership of the newspapers, and was similarly successful during a briefer period at the controls of Channel 5. He made his first fortune as the proprietors of adult television channels and magazines. The tycoon is now focused on a string of property ventures and a potential bid for the licence to run the National Lottery. Shareholders of Trinity Mirror will be asked to give their backing to the acquisition at a general meeting later this month and the deal is expected to complete by 28 February. Separately, the publisher issued a trading statement saying adjusted results were expected to be marginally ahead of forecasts with a decline in like-for-like revenues slowing in the second half. It also put aside an additional £3m to cover the cost of civil phone hacking claims, which had been higher than expected, taking the total provision for the full year to £10.5m. Shares rose nearly 10% on the update."

The incident on Wednesday morning is believed to have been caused by a plane flying overhead. It happened close to Kew Gardens station under a busy flight path into Heathrow. Taxi firm boss Mos Sayed, whose security camera recorded the moment the ice hit the ground, told Sky News: ""When I watched the footage back I was shocked to see it was the size of a boulder. ""It was enormous. It must have been about 20kg. ""It was like the film End Of Days or asteroids falling out of the sky. ""If it had fallen on someone, it would have killed them. ""It's shocking really. I walk along that street with my children every day. ""We should all be grateful no one was severely injured."" The man who was nearly hit by the ice has been named in reports as council worker Serhiy Mysehkov. He told the Richmond and Twickenham Times: ""I was sweeping on the other side of the road, then heard a loud boom. ""It all happened very quickly. I wasn't scared, but it could kill you. I feel lucky."" About 30 ice falls are reported to the UK's aviation regulator each year. It is understood they can be caused by leaks from planes or when ice forms on planes at higher altitudes and breaks off in warmer air. A Civil Aviation Authority spokesman said: ""Ice falls can be as a result of meteorological phenomena, however ice falls from aircraft are considered to be rare in UK airspace. ""The CAA receives reports of around 30 ice falls every year. We are unable to investigate the potential origin of an ice fall, but do record reports of this nature."""

2018-02-10,The capture of two British men in Syria means all four of the IS fighters in a notorious group nicknamed 'The Beatles' are now accounted for.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180210172946/https://news.sky.com/story/who-are-the-is-fighters-nicknamed-the-beatles-11242761,"American officials revealed on Thursday Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh had been detained by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, following the death of ringleader Mohammed Emwazi in a 2015 drone strike and the imprisonment of Aine Davis in Turkey. The White House believes the group - nicknamed by prisoners because of their English accents - are responsible for the beheading of more than 27 hostages, and that they have used torture methods including waterboarding and electrocution. Sky News has taken a closer look at the four west Londoners who left home to fight for Islamic State. Mohammed Emwazi The militant who became known as ""Jihadi John"" moved from Kuwait to the UK with his family when he was six. He attended state schools and studied computer science at the University of Westminster before leaving for Syria in 2013, where he would take on his infamous moniker. Emwazi - described by IS as an ""honourable brother"" - appeared in a string of IS videos showing the execution of foreign hostages, starting with the beheading of American James Foley in August 2014. The 27-year-old went on to appear in numerous other clips, including those which showed the execution of British aid workers Alan Henning and David Haines, American journalist Steven Sotloff, and US aid worker Abdul-Rahman Kassig. Emwazi was last seen in a video showing the execution of Japanese journalist Kenji Goto in January 2015 and was killed in a US strike on 12 November 2015 in the then IS stronghold of Raqqa. Aine Davis According to senior intelligence officials, Davis was plotting an imminent terrorist attack in Europe when he was arrested on the eve of the Paris atrocity in November 2015. He was taken into custody by Turkish police at a villa just a couple of hours away from the Turkish city of Istanbul, which officials believe was the likely target, and he has remained behind bars ever since. Davis is serving a seven-and-a-half year prison sentence for plotting the attack. Before he went to Syria, Davis had led a life of crime in west London. He grew up in Hammersmith and would go on to become a drug dealer, before eventually converting to Islam and becoming radicalised during his time in jail. His wife Amal El-Wahabi was jailed for two years in 2014 after being convicted of funding terrorism. The Old Bailey heard how she had convinced a friend to smuggle €15,380 into Turkey to finance her husband's fighting with IS. Alexanda Kotey The 34-year-old, from Paddington, was born in London and is said to be a Queens Park Rangers fan. Described by neighbours as a ""reserved, polite boy"", Kotey is believed to have attended the Al Manaar mosque in Notting Hill with Emwazi after converting to Islam as a teenager. He would leave his London life and two children behind to travel to Syria in 2009. Since becoming a member of IS, the terrorist is believed to have helped recruit other Britons to join the terror group, which has been driven out of its Syrian strongholds, including Raqqa. According to the US State Department, Kotey acted as a guard for IS and ""likely engaged in the group's executions and exceptionally cruel torture methods, including electronic shock and waterboarding"". El Shafee Elsheikh The 29-year-old came to Britain as a child refugee from Sudan and lived in White City, west London. Before his transformation into a jihadist, Elsheikh worked as a mechanic and was described by his mother, Maha Elgigouli, as ""very clever"" and a ""nice boy"". His father, Rashid Sidahmed Elsheikh, who worked as a translator in the capital, told The Guardian that his son's radicalisation was ""lightning fast"". Like Kotey, the US State Department said he had ""earned a reputation for waterboarding, mock executions, and crucifixions"" while serving as a jailer for IS. Before that he had been a member of al Qaeda, joining after travelling to Syria in 2012. He had a daughter called Maha with a Syrian wife, and his first wife, an Ethopian woman from Canada, had joined them and had a son named after his brother Mahmoud, who died fighting for IS in Iraq last year."

Two-and-a-half-year-old Henry was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2016. Despite surgery to remove it and further treatment, the cancer returned in autumn last year and he died last month. Delaney, who lives in London, wrote: ""He was smart, funny, and mischievous and we has so many wonderful adventures together. His drive to live and to love and to connect was profound. ""I am astonished by the love-in-action displayed by Henry's mom and his brothers. They are why I will endeavor to not go mad with grief. I don't want to miss out on their beautiful lives. I'm greedy for more experiences with them."" Henry had been left with significant physical disabilities by the tumour, Delaney said, but had ""quickly learned sign language and developed his own method of getting from A to B shuffling on his beautiful little bum"". Delaney also praised nurses and doctors, home carers and charity workers who he described as his ""heroes"" for helping the family, and urged readers to take ""concrete and sustained action"" to support the NHS. He added: ""Thank you, beautiful Henry, for spending as much time with us as you did. We miss you so much."" So very sad to hear this, at the same time as being incredibly moved and uplifted by the spirt in which you wrote that post. All the best to you and your family. On Twitter and Facebook, David Baddiel, Alison Moyet and Dom Joly were among those who have expressed their condolences. Singer Alison Moyet said: ""I am so terribly sorry for your loss. I can't imagine the pain. I wish you and yours what ever comfort is possible."" Comedian Dom Joly said: ""So sorry to hear about your boy."" Delaney, who was one of the first comedians to develop a fanbase through Twitter, has spoken extensively on the importance of the NHS and in support of universal healthcare in the US."
2018-02-10,Mark Carney has put the country on notice - the cost of borrowing is going to rise more rapidly than the Bank of England indicated only three months ago.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180210172946/https://news.sky.com/story/what-the-interest-rates-rise-warning-means-for-you-11241571,"In some ways, this is good news. Interest rates need to go up more quickly than expected because the Bank expects the economy to grow more strongly than expected this year. Unemployment is at its lowest for 43 years and, finally, wages are starting to pick up - as one would expect when the jobless rate is so low. That's the good news. The bad news is that this growth performance is due, in the Monetary Policy Committee's view, mainly because the global economy is growing more strongly than anticipated rather than because of anything we are doing at home. And, because of the UK's mediocre productivity record, the predicted rise in average earnings is, in the MPC's opinion, likely to feed into higher inflation. So the rate needs to go up. This begs the question: when will the Bank next raise the cost of borrowing? The market was putting the chances of an interest rate rise in May at 50/50 even before the Bank's inflation report, but now sees the chance of a rate rise that month as more probable than that, while a rate rise in August - a month after Mr Carney celebrates his fifth anniversary of becoming governor - is seen as a done deal. Even a rise from 0.5% to 0.75% will feed through into higher mortgage rates. Swap rates, which mortgage lenders use to price their fixed-rate home loans, have already been rising with, for example, the two-year rate more than doubling during the last 18 months. So anyone whose fixed-rate home loan is up for renewal before August should be looking right now to lock in the current rates. Likewise, mortgage borrowers on a variable-rate deal might also want to think about moving to a fixed-rate deal. For savers, the decision is less obvious. Many savings accounts are already loss-leaders for banks and building societies and so they are less likely than mortgage lenders to pass on any rise in interest rates. Anyone with both a mortgage and a decent slug of money in a savings account may be better off going for an offset mortgage. And no homeowner should be expecting much of an increase in house prices any time soon. As for investors, this may not necessarily be good news, certainly if their investments are predominantly in the FTSE-100 or funds that track its performance. One big lesson since the Brexit vote is the extent to which the Footsie moves in inverse proportion to the pound, because it is full of big multinationals that make a lot of their sales in dollars and euros, so any drop in the pound flatters those earnings. By the same token, a rise in the pound depresses those earnings in sterling terms, which is partly why Thursday's rise in the pound against both the dollar and the euro has been matched by an almost equal and opposite move in the Footsie. Higher inflation is also the enemy of the bond investor and so anyone with fixed-rate savings accounts, or money in UK gilts, will not welcome Thursday's news. Higher interest rates also mean higher borrowing costs for business, so the already anaemic rate of business investment - something Mr Carney blames for the UK's lacklustre productivity growth - looks set to continue, unless companies can find good and specific reasons to invest. If all that sounds too depressing for words, there is one over-riding reason to be cheerful about what Mr Carney has said today. The UK has just gone through a period, lasting nearly nine years, during which interest rates were held at record low levels. They were kept at those levels because the Bank of England's policy-makers were more frightened about deflation than inflation. That we are now moving - albeit very slowly - to what is a more 'normalised' interest rate environment is undeniably welcome. And one more piece of good news: higher interest rates not only ought to mean higher annuity rates for those coming up for retirement, they should also mean that pension fund deficits (because scheme liabilities are linked to gilt yields) should also, all other things being equal, start to fall. That will be excellent news for companies and, potentially, free up more capital to be invested in profitable activities rather than simply filling in pension deficits."

2018-02-10,Police officers are being given mobile finger print scanners to instantly identify suspected criminals and illegal immigrants.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180210172946/https://news.sky.com/story/police-trial-new-mobile-fingerprint-scanners-to-identify-suspects-11243561,"Two hundred and fifty of the new pocket-sized devices are being trialled in West Yorkshire before being rolled out by the Home Office across the country. The scanners, which cost less than £300 each, can be used by any officer to take two fingerprints from a suspect. They are then checked in seconds against records held in two national databases of fingerprints called IABS and IDENT1. IABS contains the fingerprints of all processed asylum seekers, while IDENT1, designed and managed by American aerospace and defence technology giant Northrop Grunman, holds data from people who have been previously arrested in the UK. The scanners access records via the Biometric Services Gateway described by the Home Office as ""a common platform for future biometrics services"". The announcement that the devices can be used to identify illegal immigrants comes less than a month after MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee expressed concern over a 10% error rate in official lists of ""disqualified people"". According to Home Office documentation, the IABS system holds ""information that the person gave to the UK Border Agency"" which can be used ""to check if the person was removed (or made a voluntary departure), which will show the destination country"". Chief Inspector Ian Williams of West Yorkshire Police acknowledged that the devices will raise some concerns, but said they will only be used where an offence is suspected and the person's identity is in doubt. ""There are human rights concerns that people will have about us using this technology,"" he said. ""But to reassure people... the fingerprints themselves don't get held on our device, they are used for the purposes of the search and then they're gone."" Minister for Policing and the Fire Service Nick Hurd said: ""It's clear that by embracing technology the police can improve efficiency and, if all forces delivered the level of productivity from mobile working as the leading forces, the average officer could spend an hour a day extra on the frontline."""
2018-02-10,"The terrorists who killed eight people on London Bridge and at Borough Market had taken steroids before the attack, a court has heard.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180210172946/https://news.sky.com/story/london-bridge-attack-terrorists-used-steroids-before-attack-11242524,"Khuram Butt, 27, Rachid Redouane, 30, and Youssef Zaghba, 22, all had high levels of a drug called DHEA in their system, according to a toxicologist speaking at a pre-inquest hearing at the Old Bailey. The presence of the hormone pill, which can be bought over the counter, was said to be ""above the physiological range"", suggesting it was used in the period from several hours to days beforehand. A natural supplement, it is widely believed to improve sex drive and help build muscle. There is little medical evidence to support these claims. The London attack, which took place on 3 June last year, began when the men drove a white van into pedestrians on the bridge. They then stabbed victims with 12-inch knives in the nearby market. The entire attack lasted eight minutes. The eight people killed were Londoner James McMullan, 32; Canadian Christine Archibald, 30; Frenchmen Xavier Thomas, 45, Alexandre Pigeard, 26, and Sebastien Belanger, 36; Australians Kirsty Boden, 28, and Sara Zelenak, 21; and Spaniard Ignacio Echeverria, 39. At least 50 others were injured in the atrocity. All three attackers, who were wearing false suicide belts to ""create maximum fear"", were shot and killed by police at the scene. Inquests into the deaths of the victims and the attackers - which will be held separately - will begin early next year. Police, security services, fire and ambulance services will attend the inquests, as well as the families of both the victims and attackers. The extent of MI5 knowledge of one of the attackers - ringleader Khuram Butt who was under active investigation by the agency - will form part of the inquiry. Around 1,800 witness statements have been taken in advance of the inquests. Lawyer Victoria Ailes, representing five of the victims' families, said anyone who had CCTV footage or mobile phone film of the attacks should come forward. Chief Coroner Mark Lucraft QC said anyone wishing to remain anonymous - including families of the attackers - will need to make requests ahead of the inquest. The use of drugs in the attack - which was London's third deadly terrorist incident in just three months - echoes Westminster attacker Khalid Masood, who is understood to have taken anabolic steroids in the hours or days before his death."

After purchasing the card, the victim reads off the number, which the fraudster either sells on or uses to purchase high value products. HMRC has written to the chief executives of major retailers, asking them to tell staff about the scam so they can help protect customers. Action Fraud said there has been 1,500 victims, mostly over the age of 65, with an average financial loss of £1,150 though some have lost much more. Following a previous awareness campaign, there have been examples of supermarket staff warning customers they may be falling victim to a scam when they purchase hundreds of pounds of iTunes vouchers. Angela MacDonald, HMRC's director general of customer service, said: ""It's really reassuring to see reports of supermarket staff, off their own back, taking action to keep customers safe. ""Raising public awareness is the best safeguard against this vicious scam. ""Supermarket staff are often the last line of defence against these fraudsters.

2018-02-10,North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has invited the South's president Moon Jae-in for a meeting in the North.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180210172946/https://news.sky.com/story/kim-jong-un-invites-south-korean-president-for-summit-11243618,"Mr Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, verbally delivered his summit offer during a lunch meeting with Mr Moon at Seoul's presidential palace as the South hosts the Winter Olympics, said Mr Moon's spokesman. Mr Moon said the North and South should continue to work to build conditions so a summit can take place and called for a quick resumption of dialogue between the US and North Korea. A visit by Mr Kim's sister, a handshake, a luncheon - those billing South Korea's Winter Games as the ""Peace Olympics"" certainly have reason to feel positive about the way it's started. There's no doubt the last 24 hours has witnessed some historic moments. Kim Yo-Jong is the first of the ruling Kim dynasty to step foot in the south since the Korean War. Her handshake with the South's president at the start of the opening ceremony was an unexpected show of unity between old foes. And now, Mr Kim has invited the South Korean leader to a summit in Pyongyang at the ""earliest date possible"". Of course, apparent shows of reconciliation have happened before and then abruptly faltered. It's clear President Moon sees the Olympics as key opportunity to engage the North and try to reopen negotiations about their nuclear ambitions. To achieve this, he’ll obviously have to walk a precarious diplomatic tightrope between his ally, the US and his old enemy, North Korea. But domestic opposition may present a personal problem for the president on the road to peace. Even as the two Korean families met in the Blue House, anti-Pyongyang protests were being held. Polling shows South Koreans are split in their views about unification, with younger males far less enthusiastic about the prospect. A survey last year by the government-run Korea Institute for National Unification found just over 70% of South Koreans in their 20s now oppose rather than support reunification. In the last four years support across the population has dropped from 68.3% to 57.8%. Dr Kim Jiyoon studies trends for Seoul’s Asan Institute and explained: ""Almost 30% of the elderly group still say the North Korea is one of us, so they still share some nostalgic feelings towards North Korea from before Korea was divided. But the younger generation is different. Almost half of young males say that North Koreans are the enemy.” If President Moon’s hope of a political thaw at the Winter Games is to be realised he is going to have to change hearts and minds at home and abroad."

The incident was captured on CCTV. The driver hit the brakes but the train continued to travel three quarters of the way down the platform. Mr Lesjongard managed to curl up into a ball and was able to crawl from underneath the carriage after the train passed over him. He suffered a broken ankle and deep cuts to his neck and shoulders. Alencar of Northcote Street, Edinburgh, walked away after the incident, the court heard. On the day of the attack he had been on ""temporary discharge from a facility where he was detained in Edinburgh"", and had been visiting his mother who was also receiving psychiatric treatment.

Nguyen claimed his wife and son died in the tragedy and was pictured shaking hands with the Prince of Wales when he met survivors. The man even spoke to Sky News at the time of the disaster and described the ""shock"" of ""seeing dead bodies"". ""The last time I saw my son and wife was on the 12th floor,"" he said during an interview. ""It (the smoke) was like snow, like fog, you can't see. It was too dark to see. You can't see anything. I couldn't breathe. I was like that - like I got a heart attack for 20 minutes."" At his sentencing, the 53-year-old, of Beckenham, southeast London, showed no emotion as he learned his fate. Judge Philip Bartle QC said Nguyen knew ""full well"" what the consequences of his actions were. ""I do not accept that the acts were in some way an attempt to be part of a community and that you were in some way reaching out in order to be embraced by that community,"" he said. ""I am sure from everything I have seen... that despite your low IQ you knew full well what you were doing. ""You knew that you were taking advantage of these genuine victims at this terrible time of this terrible tragedy."" The court heard that Nguyen recalled to family liaison officers how he lost sight of his family in a smoke-clogged stairwell. But the prosecution said while a major recovery operation was under way the day after the deadly blaze, Nguyen was nine miles away at a housing charity. Defence barrister Keima Payton told the court that a report prepared by a psychologist found Nguyen had an ""astonishingly low"" IQ that put him in the bottom 2.5% of people in Britain. It found that he was suffering from ""long-term, untreated post-traumatic stress disorder"", depression and low empathy. Part of the reason why Nguyen acted the way he did was to ""feel part of a group, to be looked after, wanted and welcome"", the report concluded. Nguyen received around £11,270 from charities and Kensington and Chelsea Council, the court heard. The defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud by false representation and one count of making an untrue statement for the purpose of obtaining a passport at a previous hearing in November.

He has not been seen since a probation meeting in Hackney on 31 January. He was jailed in 2001 for the murder of costume designer Elizabeth Sherlock as she chased his then-girlfriend Jackie Moorehouse, who stole her bag and jumped into Wolley's car to make a getaway. Ms Sherlock, 42, had jumped onto the car and was thrown into the air as it was driven away by Woolley - who allegedly smiled as he ran over her body. She had been travelling to her father's birthday with her husband. Woolley is described as a white man of slim build, with greying hair and tattoos. He has scars on his forehead, jaw and left ear and is 5ft 4in tall. The public have been warned not to approach him if seen. He had scores of previous convictions at the time of the killing, and both he and Moorehouse - who was cleared of murder - stole to fuel their heroin habit. Judge Michael Hyam, when sentencing Wolley, said he had killed the successful and courageous Ms Sherlock while ""eking out a worthless existence by thieving to raise money to buy your next heroin fix"". He added: ""It was a wicked act done without pity and without remorse. ""You were seen to smile. Everyone who saw what you did was sickened by it and everyone who has heard or read of it must be appalled by your lack of human feeling for a woman who had every right to stop you from getting away with her property."""
2018-02-10,A volatile week for world stock markets has ended with London's FTSE 100 Index sliding again by more than 1%.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180210172946/https://news.sky.com/story/stock-markets-see-fresh-losses-after-volatile-week-11242251,"The drop for the UK's blue-chip index on Friday comes on top of its 1.5% decline on Thursday, taking it below 7,100 to its lowest level since December 2016. The FTSE saw a drop of nearly 5% over the week. European indexes were also sharply down. The Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its second biggest fall in history on Thursday, with the decline of 1,032 points only surpassed by the drop of 1,175 witnessed on Monday. This placed the index into what is known as the correction phase, when there is a drop of more than a tenth. It see-sawed in early Friday trading, but surged again in the final hour and ended up 1.4%. Meanwhile the oil price has been sliding too, with Brent crude slipping under $63 a barrel having topped $70 in January amid a broad recovery. It has also been a tough session for the pound, which fell by a cent against both the dollar and the euro after EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier threw into doubt plans for a Brexit transition. Despite this week's turbulence, global markets are still close to historically high levels. Analysts have also pointed out that corrections of this kind are normal. The US stock market began its current wobble last Friday after strong wages and jobs figures suggested inflation could increase and the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates faster than expected. Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said: ""Far and away the most important things are the fear that the Fed is going to make a mistake, and higher wages are going to cut into margins."" The Bank of England also spooked investors on Thursday by signalling that interest rates are likely to rise earlier and more sharply than previously thought. In Asia this morning, Shanghai stocks plunged 4% while Japan's Nikkei Index fell 2.3% and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong dropped 3.1%"

On the evening of 21 January last year, Mr Islam was said to have not taken kindly to Mr Evans' complaint about the tandoori chicken served to him and his wife at the diner, which had a 3.5 star rating on TripAdvisor. Mr Evans claimed that when he made his displeasure about the main meals known to Mr Islam, he began asking what the problem was in an aggressive manner and started swearing at the couple. The 47-year-old proceeded to point and shout at the couple from the kitchen doorway before reaching for the hot spice and launching a ""large fistful"" it towards Mr Evans, Methyr Tydfil Crown Court heard. CCTV footage played in court showed the moment Mr Evans followed Mr Islam towards the kitchen, and standing in the doorway before the red powder was thrown. Giving evidence on Wednesday, Mr Islam said Mrs Evans had ""grabbed"" his hand and sworn at him during their initial dispute, which left him feeling ""very frightened"". ""Lots of people say to me 'why not run away', but my wife and kid were there so I cannot run,"" he said. ""I ran to get the chilli powder because I wanted to get it before he grabbed me."" Mr Evans said he was still suffering from poor vision as a result of having the powder thrown at him, despite being discharged from hospital with ""good vision"" just a few days afterwards. Defending Mr Islam on Friday, Ruth Smith said Mr Evans and his wife were ""clearly unreliable witnesses"", with an account of events that was ""riddled with inconsistencies"". Pointing out there were ""vast chunks of the evening that they have no recollection of"", including the number of times staff members attended their table, she asked the jury to consider whether they had been drunk. The court heard how the couple had ordered two bottles of wine and two Cobra beers on the night, but Mrs Evans insisted that they had not started on the second bottle by the time the drama unfolded. Ms Smith told the jury: ""It is clear that the consequences of the chilli going into Mr Evans' eyes were unpleasant, but just because one person ends with an injury does not mean they are a victim. ""Mr Islam told you that through his years of experience he was alert to the sense of aggression and once the backing away and giving of space to Mr Evans had not worked, he felt under threat."" The jury took three hours and 45 minutes to clear Mr Islam, deciding the effect of the powder had been ""exaggerated"" by Mr Evans. Mr Islam has closed the restaurant since the incident and is now working as an air conditioning engineer."

Deep-voiced Cathey won widespread praise for his role as Freddy - the owner of the BBQ restaurant favoured by the character Frank Underwood in House of Cards - including an Emmy award for best guest actor in 2015. In seasons four and five of The Wire, he played Norman Wilson, the deputy campaign manager for the ambitious mayoral Tommy Carcetti. Cathey also collaborated with The Wire creator David Simon on the Emmy award-winning miniseries The Corner. He also had roles in several other TV shows such as Law and Order and 30 Rock, and in movies like Fantastic Four and S.W.A.T. Cathey's former colleagues have paid tribute to him on Twitter.

It has been housed at the museum since 1905, but has now begun a three-year tour of the UK, starting with Dorset County Museum in Dorchester, near to the UK's Jurassic Coast. In life, Dippy - a member of the Diplodocus carnegii species - would have lived between 145 million and 156 million years ago in North America, at the end of the Jurassic period. While early research believed that Diplodocuses would have stood with their necks held high in the air, more modern studies have suggested the neutral position was more likely to have been horizontal - the position in which it is typically now displayed. It is estimated five million people will see Dippy while he travels the country. Jon Murden, the director of the Dorset County Museum, said he was delighted so many people were predicted to come out and see Dippy. ""I think it's because he's a museum superstar. He's a true icon of the museum world. ""You often think of that entrance to the Natural History Museum, where he stood,"" when you think about museums in general."" Lorraine Cornish from the Natural History Museum said: ""It's a really proud day, it has been a lot of work to plan this with all the venues. ""It took two weeks to put Dippy together and we are really, really pleased Dippy is going to open to the public on Saturday. ""Although the dinosaur has 292 bones, Dippy comes together in 86 pieces. ""We chose Dorset because we decided we wanted to go back in time to when Dippy was around, 150 million years ago, and the Jurassic Coast is the home of palaeontology."" Ms Cornish went on: ""It is great for people to be able to come and see Dippy in a venue outside of London, it's free and there are a fantastic range of events to engage people, young and old with Dippy, the natural world and natural history."" After spending three months on display in Dorchester, Dippy will travel to museums and cathedrals in Birmingham, Belfast, Glasgow, Newcastle, Cardiff, Rochdale and Norwich"
2018-02-10,The Treasury has held secret talks with‎ US officials aimed at accelerating a multibillion fine for Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) that would finally draw a line under its pre-bailout misconduct.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180210172946/https://news.sky.com/story/treasury-holds-us-talks-in-bid-to-seal-huge-rbs-mis-selling-fine-11244361,"Sky News has learnt that officials from the Treasury were due to discuss earlier this week the progress of settlement negotiations between RBS‎ and the Department of Justice (DoJ) over the mis-selling of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS). The talks were scheduled just days before the state-backed lender is expected to report its tenth consecutive annual loss - depending upon whether it takes another big charge for the impending DoJ fine. A senior City insider said this weekend that discussions between the Treasury and US officials were aimed at expediting a final penalty for the bank, which some analysts predict could be higher than £5bn. RBS ‎has already set aside $3.3bn (£2.4bn) to cover the DoJ penalty, and last year paid $5.5bn (£4bn) to the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) in relation to the bank's issuance and underwriting of $32bn of RMBS during the leadership of former boss Fred Goodwin. One source said on Saturday that the Treasury's intervention could lead to a deal with the DoJ being agreed within weeks, although the timing remains uncertain. Talks between the DoJ and a cluster of international banks, which also includes Barclays, stalled for months following the election of Donald Trump, the US President, because of a dearth of senior officials within the agency. With that staffing vacuum now resolved, both RBS and the UK Treasury want a settlement agreed as quickly as possible. It is conceivable that the bank could take another major provision in its 2017 results, which will be signed off by its board shortly before it announced full-year figures on 23 February. However, without greater certainty over the likely penalty, RBS will have to delay any new charges until this financial year, making it probable that it will also be loss-making in 2018. Ross McEwan, RBS's chief executive, and finance chief Ewen Stevenson have told investors for months that they anticipated settling with the DoJ in 2017, but became more pessimistic about that prospect during the final months of the year. Concluding the DoJ talks is the biggest remaining obstacle to RBS paying a dividend to shareholders, the largest of which by far remains the British taxpayer following the bank's £45.5bn bailout in 2008. Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, has also signalled that any further sale of the public's 71%‎ stake is contingent upon the US fine being announced. He has publicly acknowledged that future disposals are likely to incur losses for British taxpayers. RBS remains under pressure on several fronts, not least its treatment of small business customers during and after the banking crisis, but its financial performance has improved markedly, with the first three quarters of 2017 all ending in the black. That brighter picture will lead to RBS announcing the smallest reduction in its bonus pool since its taxpayer rescue, according to people close to the bank. Sources said it was in discussions with UK Financial Investments, the agency which manages the Government's stake, about paying bonuses of marginally less than the £343m it awarded last year. As well as the outstanding DoJ penalty, RBS also faces a number of much smaller RMBS probes in the US, as well as civil litigation relating to the malpractice which has seen other banks fined tens of billions of dollars. RBS and the Treasury both declined to comment this weekend."

The F-16 crashed during a mission after an Iranian drone had entered Israeli airspace and was shot down, according to the Israeli military. The Syrian state news agency SANA reported Israel had ""carried out a new aggression against one of our military bases in the centre of the country"". ""Our air defences repelled it and hit more than one plane."" The Israeli pilots of the crashed F-16 were reported to be alive but one was seriously injured. Police said the jet crashed in the Jezreel Valley in northern Israel. An Israeli military statement said: ""During the attack, multiple anti-aircraft missiles were fired at IAF (Israel Air Force) aircraft. :: Analysis - Iran and Syria ""playing with fire"" as drone intercepted ""The pilots of one of the aircraft abandoned as per procedure. The pilots landed in Israeli territory and were taken to the hospital for medical treatment."" An Israeli military spokesman said early assessments of the plane's wreckage suggest it was shot down but this has not been confirmed. The Syrian regime's allies Russia and Lebanese militant group Hezbollah deny claims the Iranian drone entered Israeli airspace, calling them ""lies"". Iran has also dismissed Israel's claims. During the attack, anti-aircraft missiles were fired towards Israel, triggering alarms that were heard in northern Israel. The exchange of fire was the most serious between arch enemies Israel and Iran since the start of the civil war in Syria in 2011. It marked the first time Israel publicly acknowledged attacking what it identified as Iranian targets in Syria since war broke out. The Israeli military issued a warning to Tehran, saying it was responsible for the drone that entered Israel. In recent weeks, Israel has repeatedly warned against the presence of Iranian forces in neighbouring Syria. Israel has carried out dozens of air strikes on the Syrian armed forces and their allies since the civil war started. Iran along with Russia is the main military backer of the Damascus government. Israel has largely confined its operations to targeting Hezbollah, the Shia militant group that is a key ally of Iran. Sky's Middle East correspondent Alex Rossi said: ""This began when Israel downed an Iranian drone. It was intercepted and they now have it. ""An hour later, Israeli jets were dispatched and sent to attack the base in Syria where the drone came from."" He said the incident marked an escalation in the conflict in Syria. He said: ""This will be seen as Iranian aggression. Although we are not at that stage yet, this could result in a new conflict on the Syrian, Lebanon and Israel border."" Israeli military spokesman Jonathan Conricus said Iran was ""playing with fire"" by infiltrating Israeli airspace and would pay a heavy price. He said: ""We are willing, prepared and capable to exact a heavy price from anyone that attacks us, however we are not looking to escalate the situation. ""This was a defensive effort triggered by an Iranian act of aggression and we are defending our airspace, our sovereignty and civilians."" He said the unmanned aircraft Israel shot down was ""on a military mission sent and operated by Iranian military forces"". Mr Conricus said that in response, Israel destroyed the Iranian site in central Syria that launched the drone. Further attacks were carried out against four additional Iranian targets and eight Syrian sites. It marks Israel's most significant involvement in Syria to date and the military says it is ""ready for various scenarios and will continue to act according to situation assessments"". Iran accused Israel of ""lies"" and said Syria had the right to ""legitimate self-defence"" in response to air strikes. Foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi said: ""Iran believes Syria has the right to legitimate self-defence. To cover their crimes in the region, Israeli officials are resorting to lies against other countries. ""The allegations regarding surveillance by an Iranian drone are too ridiculous for words."" Iran released a joint statement alongside the other main allies of the Syrian regime, Russia and Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, vowing a ""relentless response"" to Israeli ""aggression"". The statement said the Israeli air strikes had targeted drones used in the fight against ""terrorist organisations"" especially Islamic State. Mr Ghasemi added: ""Iran does not have a military presence in Syria, and has only sent military advisers at the request of the Syrian government. ""We deny all unfounded allegations by the Zionists. The government and Syrian army are only defending themselves against Israeli aggression."" Lebanon also criticised the Israeli strikes and vowed to write a letter of protest to the United Nations over the use of its airspace for the raids."

The Londoners were the last members of a group of four Britons who are believed to have tortured and beheaded dozens of people. The group, which also included ""Jihadi John"" Mohammed Emwazi and Aine Davis, was nicknamed The Beatles by hostages because their English accents set them apart from other foreign fighters. :: Who are the IS fighters nicknamed 'The Beatles'? Nicolas Henin, a French journalist who was held captive by Islamic State for 10 months, said the time had come for real justice. He told Sky News: ""They were part of a group of four British jihadis that we nicknamed 'The Beatles', as they were, especially at the end of my captivity, responsible for us as a group of about two dozen western hostages."" He continued: ""This is the beginning of a process that will bring them eventually, hopefully, to a trial. Justice is just what I want. ""Guantanamo is a denial of justice. Guantanamo was opened 16 years ago. There hasn't been a single trial there. ""What I want is a trial and a trial potentially that I can attend, so rather, a trial in London rather than one in Kobani in northern Syria,"" he added. Ringleader Emwazi was killed in a drone strike in 2015 and Davis is in jail in Turkey after being convicted last year on terrorism charges. Kotey and Elsheikh were captured in early January by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces. Relatives of some of the cell's other alleged victims echoed Mr Henin's call for the pair to face trial. Bethany Haines, whose father David was killed in 2014 after being held captive for 18 months, said she hoped the pair's detention could bring some closure for bereaved families. In a post on Facebook and Instagram, she said: ""It's brilliant that these evil people have been caught. The families will now have people to hold account for their loved ones death. No punishment is enough for these barbarians and in my opinion they should be sentenced to a slow painful death."" US officials have pledged to hold the terrorists accountable, with a Defence Department spokesman adding that they were ""still considering options"" for what to do with the pair. ""We are still considering options regarding el-Sheikh and Kotey, but rest assured our intention is to hold anyone accountable who commits acts like those they are alleged to have committed,"" said Major Adrian Rakine-Galloway. He confirmed they are being held in a ""detention location"" in Syria but said he could not give any further information. The arrests reportedly took place in the Deir ez-Zur region in the north east of Syria, towards the Iraq border. Elsheikh, 29, and Kotey, 34, both came from London and are said to have earned a reputation for engaging in Islamic State's ""exceptionally cruel torture methods"", including waterboarding. Kotey was a recruiter for the terror group and was responsible for enlisting several UK nationals."

The creams are used to treat skin conditions such as eczema and psoriasis. ""Hundreds of thousands of people use them, we're not sure how many fire deaths might have occurred but it could be into the hundreds,"" he told BBC 5 Live. ""People are using paraffin-based skin products to treat eczema and psoriasis and various other skin creams, putting it all over their bodies and different parts of themselves - treating themselves for those different skin conditions. ""But unfortunately, that cream can get into fabrics, clothing, bandages and dressings, and become flammable.

The comments come after an investigation by the radio station and Inside Out Yorkshire and Lincolnshire found just seven of 38 paraffin-based products licensed in the UK had warnings on their packaging. Users should not smoke, use naked flames or go near anything which may cause a fire while the creams are in contact with dressings or clothing, according to the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. Its advice says ""patients' clothing and bedding should be changed regularly - preferably daily - because emollients soak into fabric and can become a fire hazard""."

Two bodies have been found at the site, according to an official at Russia's Emergency Situations Ministry. An emergency services source told Tass news agency there are no survivors. The Emergencies Ministry said it had sent crews to the crash site, in Stepanovskoye. Russian media reports the crews could not get to the site by vehicle and had to go by foot. Tass news agency added that Russian authorities have confirmed fragments of the plane have been found, around 25 miles (40km) from the airport in Moscow. Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""The president offers his profound condolences to those who lost their relatives in the crash."" The domestic plane was being operated by Saratov airlines, and had 65 passengers on board, along with six crew members. It was flying to Orsk, a city in the Urals. Officials said all of the passengers aboard are believed to have been residents of the Urals. According to Flight Radar it took off at 11.22am (local time) and five minutes later it was tracked descending at 3,300 ft per minute before the signal was lost. Witnesses in the village told local media they saw a burning plane falling from the sky. In a tweet the ministry explained the recovery process would involve 150 people and 20 vehicles. It is not immediately clear what caused the crash, with weather conditions and pilot error said to be among the possible reasons. Images from Orsk airport show distressed relatives after learning the plane had crashed. Andrei Odintsov, the mayor of Orsk, said six psychologists and four ambulances were working with relatives in the small airport. The Russian-made AN-148 was seven-years-old and was bought by the airline one year ago. According to Tass, the aircraft was taken out of service between 2015 and 2017 because of a shortage of parts. The Emergencies Ministry has opened a telephone hotline after the crash. An investigation has been opened."

It comes as figures from a Freedom of Information investigation show that over half of local authorities do not have a plan to help children of alcoholics. Liam Byrne, Labour MP and the chair of the All-Party Group for Children of Alcoholics, lost his father to alcoholism in 2015. He told Sky News: ""If you are the child of an alcoholic, you grow up with a kind of silent shame. You are surrounded by stigma. ""You feel very guilty, you can't really talk to anybody about it, and the result is that children of alcoholics are much more likely to develop problems with mental health. ""They're much more likely to attempt suicide and they're much more likely to become alcoholics themselves. ""Unless we break the cycle now to put in place a proper plan to help the children of alcoholics this pain is just going to cascade down the generations for years to come."" The report, titled Parental Alcohol Misuse and Children, also found that nearly a fifth (18%) of children reported feeling embarrassed by seeing their parent drunk, while 15% said their bedtime routine had been disrupted as a result of their parents drinking. Children living with alcohol-dependent parents say they feel socially isolated and are reluctant to seek help. Josh Connolly, 30, from Wootton Bassett, witnessed his father's death through drinking when he was just nine years old. He said: ""My dad was quite a chaotic drinker. He would regularly drink vast amounts and regularly be a chaotic influence in my life. ""I was present when my dad took an overdose. I was in his flat at the time and he told me he had to take a load of tablets to help him with his drinking. ""He took all of them, and that is when he passed away, so I was there when it happened. So the trauma from that stayed with me for a long, long time."" He continued: ""Because I suppressed it I almost forgot that it happened and what I was left with was traumatic feelings. Feelings of loneliness, guilt, anger and pain. ""But because I suppressed and tried to forget the way that I felt it meant that I was suffering in complete silence."" Mr Connolly said there is lots of support for alcoholics but not for their relatives, particularly children. He is backing a campaign calling for proper funding of support services, as well as an anonymous helpline run by the charity National Association of Children of Alcoholics (NACAO). At the moment the helpline receives, on average, 100 calls per day. ""It's absolutely vital that we raise more awareness, so that we can give these people more support so that they have the same chance as everyone else in their lives,"" he said."

2018-02-11,A mother who sparked a nationwide appeal to find her lost daughter before admitting she'd buried her in a forest has had her sentence extended.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180211174807/https://news.sky.com/story/mother-who-buried-daughter-has-sentence-extended-to-20-years-11245796,"Cecile Bourgeon claimed her five-year-old daughter Fiona had gone missing in a park in Clermont-Ferrand, France, in 2013, while she was playing with her two-year-old sister. But four months later, after desperate searches for the little girl, she and her then-partner Berkane Marklouf admitted they had buried her in a forest following an ""accident at home"". Bourgeon, 30, had been acquitted of murder in 2016 and sentenced to five years for lying about her daughter's fate. Following a two-week appeal in central France, a jury of nine women overturned her sentence and handed her a 20-year penalty, quadrupling her jail time. Makhlouf had been given 20 years when they were sentenced in 2016. Bourgeon, a drug addict, said Fiona was ""accidentally punched"" and claimed Makhlouf had beaten her in a drunken fury. Makhlouf accused her of kicking the little girl in the stomach and head. Both said she had died because of a ""domestic accident"", not the violence, claiming they had panicked when they found her body the next morning. Her body was never found. At the latest hearing, Prosecutor Raphael Gentile de Sanesi described the pair as ""torturers"" who collaborated in ""ongoing violence"" against her daughter in the days leading up to her death. There was no new evidence about how Fiona died or how much responsibility each adult bore in her death but the court recognised she was the victim of ""mistreatment"". Bourgeon was not given the full 30-year term available to jurors, but they did choose to withdraw her parental authority from her other two children. Fiona's father Nicolas Chafoulais said: ""She got the sentence she deserves. It is a relief for me and justice for Fiona. ""But am I at peace? No. It hasn't brought my daughter back."" When the facts of the case emerged in 2013, there was outrage in the community that either mother or her partner had killed the little girl they had been searching for."

It's the second time he has been allowed a holiday from his sentence. During each one, he must report to police twice a day. The decision to allow Koufodinas to leave prison has been criticised by Britain and America. Kate Smith, the UK ambassador to Greece, tweeted: ""It is extremely disheartening to see an unrepentant convicted terrorist get out of jail like this. We respect the independence of Greek justice, but once again the memory of victims of terrorism and the feelings of their families are cruelly violated."" When he was released for a similar break in November last year, the US state department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said: ""Convicted terrorists do not deserve a vacation from prison."" Koufodinas was a member of the guerrilla group November 17 (17N), which is believed to have disbanded after many of its members were arrested before the 2004 Olympics. He is serving 11 life terms plus 25 years for his role in assassinations of prominent people including US, British and Turkish diplomat and military personnel. The group carried out 103 attacks and killed 23 people. He acknowledged his crimes but never repented for them. In January 2014, one prisoner, also a 17N member, who was sent on temporary release failed to report back and a reward was offered for his return. In 2003, 23 of the prisoners granted furlough failed to return at all, and three of them died while on furlough, according to a report released in 2016. There are three types of leave given to prisoners who apply for furlough in Greece. Prisoners can get home leave, which allows them out for one to five days at a time, or up to eight days if they have served two-fifths of their sentence, or 12 years for life sentences. The annual total cannot be more than 40 days. There are two other types of furlough to grant prisoners time out of jail, for either exceptional family circumstances or to attend educational courses. Prisoners must apply for furlough, before social workers assess the application and offer their verdict on suitability based on custodial behaviour, home circumstances and previous responses to leave. Greece passed a law allowing furlough from prison in the 1960s but it wasn't implemented until 1990."
2018-02-11,Mark Carney has put the country on notice - the cost of borrowing is going to rise more rapidly than the Bank of England indicated only three months ago.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180211174807/https://news.sky.com/story/what-the-interest-rates-rise-warning-means-for-you-11241571,"In some ways, this is good news. Interest rates need to go up more quickly than expected because the Bank expects the economy to grow more strongly than expected this year. Unemployment is at its lowest for 43 years and, finally, wages are starting to pick up - as one would expect when the jobless rate is so low. That's the good news. The bad news is that this growth performance is due, in the Monetary Policy Committee's view, mainly because the global economy is growing more strongly than anticipated rather than because of anything we are doing at home. And, because of the UK's mediocre productivity record, the predicted rise in average earnings is, in the MPC's opinion, likely to feed into higher inflation. So the rate needs to go up. This begs the question: when will the Bank next raise the cost of borrowing? The market was putting the chances of an interest rate rise in May at 50/50 even before the Bank's inflation report, but now sees the chance of a rate rise that month as more probable than that, while a rate rise in August - a month after Mr Carney celebrates his fifth anniversary of becoming governor - is seen as a done deal. Even a rise from 0.5% to 0.75% will feed through into higher mortgage rates. Swap rates, which mortgage lenders use to price their fixed-rate home loans, have already been rising with, for example, the two-year rate more than doubling during the last 18 months. So anyone whose fixed-rate home loan is up for renewal before August should be looking right now to lock in the current rates. Likewise, mortgage borrowers on a variable-rate deal might also want to think about moving to a fixed-rate deal. For savers, the decision is less obvious. Many savings accounts are already loss-leaders for banks and building societies and so they are less likely than mortgage lenders to pass on any rise in interest rates. Anyone with both a mortgage and a decent slug of money in a savings account may be better off going for an offset mortgage. And no homeowner should be expecting much of an increase in house prices any time soon. As for investors, this may not necessarily be good news, certainly if their investments are predominantly in the FTSE-100 or funds that track its performance. One big lesson since the Brexit vote is the extent to which the Footsie moves in inverse proportion to the pound, because it is full of big multinationals that make a lot of their sales in dollars and euros, so any drop in the pound flatters those earnings. By the same token, a rise in the pound depresses those earnings in sterling terms, which is partly why Thursday's rise in the pound against both the dollar and the euro has been matched by an almost equal and opposite move in the Footsie. Higher inflation is also the enemy of the bond investor and so anyone with fixed-rate savings accounts, or money in UK gilts, will not welcome Thursday's news. Higher interest rates also mean higher borrowing costs for business, so the already anaemic rate of business investment - something Mr Carney blames for the UK's lacklustre productivity growth - looks set to continue, unless companies can find good and specific reasons to invest. If all that sounds too depressing for words, there is one over-riding reason to be cheerful about what Mr Carney has said today. The UK has just gone through a period, lasting nearly nine years, during which interest rates were held at record low levels. They were kept at those levels because the Bank of England's policy-makers were more frightened about deflation than inflation. That we are now moving - albeit very slowly - to what is a more 'normalised' interest rate environment is undeniably welcome. And one more piece of good news: higher interest rates not only ought to mean higher annuity rates for those coming up for retirement, they should also mean that pension fund deficits (because scheme liabilities are linked to gilt yields) should also, all other things being equal, start to fall. That will be excellent news for companies and, potentially, free up more capital to be invested in profitable activities rather than simply filling in pension deficits."

A police spokesman said: ""Four people have been injured in the incident - quite seriously - but we still cannot determine the perpetrator's motive."" Worshipper Andhi Cahyo said a few minutes after the service started, a congregation member ran in with a bleeding head while he was chased by a young man holding a sharp weapon. He said: ""Everybody started panicking and screaming. I was scrambling to save my wife and children."" As the attacker slashed Christian imagery and a number of books and damaged a Virgin Mary statue, people used another door to escape. Police arrived soon after the attack and fired a warning shot but the attacker refused to surrender. The man was shot and wounded by police and taken to hospital following the attack on the island of Java. The police spokesman said: ""After the warning shot was fired, the attacker charged towards the officer with his sword. The officer then shot him below his stomach, but he managed to injure the cop before being subdued."" All the victims have been taken to hospital for treatment. Police said the man was a university student in his early 20s but could not confirm if the incident was terror-related. The man is undergoing treatment at Bhayangkara Hospital and has yet to be questioned by police. Extremists have carried out a series of attacks against Christians and other minorities in the mainly Muslim country. Several children were injured after a man threw Molotov cocktails at a church during a Sunday service in 2016.

Writing in the Mail on Sunday, he said: ""The fact that conditions are unsatisfactory does not mean that they can't get worse.

He added: ""To make matters worse, the divorce process will preoccupy both Britain and Europe for years ahead, when they should be uniting to resist external enemies like Putin's Russia and resolve the internal contradictions that made some people regard the EU as their enemy."" Mr Soros said Brexit had divided the country, turning young against old and that young people had become disillusioned with democracy after older votes ""overruled"" them in the referendum. He said he was a ""proud supporter"" of Best for Britain and he said the effect of the uncertainty created by Brexit would become ""painfully obvious"" in the coming six months when negotiations entered the ""most contentious phase"". The Daily Telegraph first reported Mr Soros's donation to Best for Britain in a story written by a team including Theresa May's former chief of staff Nick Timothy, who backed the Leave cause. Mr Timothy used his column in the newspaper to claim that Best for Britain wanted to bring down Mrs May's government.

2018-02-11,Plagiarism software has discovered a possible new inspiration for some of William Shakespeare's best-known plays.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180211174807/https://news.sky.com/story/has-the-source-of-some-of-william-shakespeares-most-famous-works-been-found-11245415,"The software WCopyfind was originally developed to catch university students plagiarising other works, but two Shakespeare scholars say it proves one of the famous playwright's sources. Dennis McCarthy and June Schlueter have shared their findings in a book to be published next week by academic press DS Brewer and the British Library. According to the New York Times, they are not suggesting Shakespeare plagiarised but rather that he read and was inspired by the manuscript, entitled A Brief Discourse of Rebellion and Rebels. It was written in 1576 by George North, who served as an ambassador to Sweden in the court of Queen Elizabeth and is a warning against rebellion. Mr North's point is that all rebellions against a monarch are unjust and doomed to fail, with rebels suffering terrible consequences. Shakespeare's position on rebellion was not as clear but Mr McCarthy says he obviously got some of characters and themes from the work. One of those characters is Jack Cade, who led a failed rebellion against Henry VI in 1450. Shakespeare described him as hungry and eating grass in his final days in Henry VI, Part 2, before he was caught and dragged through the streets by his feet and his body eaten by crows. It had been thought that Shakespeare made this up but it was all in a part of Mr North's manuscript, where he also mentions two other rebels. Mr McCarthy and Ms Schlueter say Shakespeare created his character by combining the three. The manuscript may also be the source of passages in Richard III, MacBeth and King Lear. Shakespeare is believed to have written these works in the late 1590s or early 1600s. In a video made to promote their book, Mr McCarthy said: ""When you read the manuscript, you see the origins of this and you understand why Shakespeare is working with the characters, why he created these characters and created these scenes."" The software compared Shakespeare's work with the manuscript by examining words and phrases common to them. Mr McCarthy told the New York Times: ""People don't realise how rare these words actually are. ""And he keeps hitting word after word. It's like a lottery ticket. It's easy to get one number out of six, but not to get every number."" Mr McCarthy admits, however, that we do not know how Shakespeare would have read the hand-written manuscript, which he says was kept at the North family estate throughout the playwright's life."
2018-02-11,US broadcaster NBC has apologised after offending Koreans by seemingly downplaying Japan's colonial occupation of the peninsula.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180211174807/https://news.sky.com/story/broadcaster-nbc-apologises-over-japan-korea-olympics-gaffe-11246056,"Former journalist Joshua Cooper Ramo suggested Japan's occupation of the peninsula from 1910 to 1945 had a positive legacy, as the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games took place in Pyeongchang. During the Parade of Nations, Mr Ramo said it was notable that Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe made the trip to the games. Mr Ramo described Japan as ""a country which occupied Korea from 1910 to 1945 but every Korean will tell you that Japan is a cultural, technological and economic example that has been so important to their own transformation"". Japan's occupation of Korea remains a contested subject in the relationship between the two nations. In particular, the issue of ""comfort women"" - women pressed into sexual slavery by Japan's army - remains a highly-charged topic in the country, where victims feel the Japanese government has never sincerely made amends. On Sunday, an NBC spokesman said: ""We apologised quickly both in writing and on television for a remark made by one of our presenters during Friday night's opening ceremony. ""We're very gratified that Pyeongchang's organising committee has accepted that apology."" In December, Mr Abe apologised for the ""incurable physical and psychological wounds"" suffered by the euphemistically termed ""comfort women"", who were taken from Korea to work in military-run brothels, and pledged more than £5.37m to help the victims. At the time of Mr Abe's apology, South Korean president Park Geun-hye said: ""Most of victims are at an advanced age and nine died this year alone. I hope the mental pains of the elderly comfort women will be eased."" The initial reaction of former sex slaves was mixed.

The charity is accused of suppressing information about aid workers hosting sex parties with prostitutes during a 2010 mission to Haiti. Despite the claims arising publicly on Friday, Ms Patel said ""a lot of people knew about this"". She named the Charity Commission and her own former department. Ms Patel told Sky News: ""A Government department should have been calling for prosecutions back then, asking for evidence and actually taking money back from Oxfam as far back to 2011. ""I did my own research and I have to say I had a lot of pushback within my own department. ""I pushed hard - I had pushback internally and that is the scandal. The scandal is within the industry, people know about this."" The new International Development Secretary, Penny Mordaunt, has defended her department and claimed she first heard about the claims when they were made in The Times newspaper. She said: ""In the 21st century, it is utterly despicable that sexual exploitation and abuse continues to exist in the aid sector. ""The horrific behaviour by some members of Oxfam staff in Haiti in 2011 is an example of a wider issue on which DFID is already taking action, both at home and with the international community via the UN."" She added she was writing to all UK charities which receive UK aid asking them to spell out the steps they are taking to ensure safeguarding policies are in place and working properly. ""With regard to Oxfam and any other organisation that has safeguarding issues, we expect them to co-operate fully with such authorities, and we will cease to fund any organisation that does not."" Ms Mordaunt replaced Ms Patel in November, when the latter was forced to resign over secret meetings she held with Israeli officials."

International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt promised more detail on plans for Britain's departure from the EU. ""What the public want is, they want the vision and they want some meat on the bones,"" she told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. Mrs May will address a conference in Munich, Germany, to detail the ""security partnership"" the UK wants to maintain with the EU27. Boris Johnson is set to launch a plea for national unity in a speech on Valentine's Day. But while other senior figures such as Brexit Secretary David Davis and Cabinet Office minister David Lidlington will also get their own speeches, Chancellor Philip Hammond will not. Justice Secretary David Gauke denied Mr Hammond, who campaigned for Remain in the EU referendum, was being excluded as part of a ""plot"". He told ITV's Peston on Sunday: ""He is not part of the set of speeches that have been outlined today, but that doesn't mean that the Chancellor is not expressing his views both internally in the Cabinet conversations, but also externally. ""So, I don't think that there really is anything in this that this is somehow any kind of plot to gag a particular faction of ministers. I don't think that's a fair characterisation at all."" It comes after a rocky week in relations between the UK and EU. Mr Davis said Brussels was ""unwise"" to devise a plan to sanction Britain by suspending its access to the single market in the event of a disagreement during the transition. He said officials had been ""discourteous"" and that the plan was ""not in good faith"". EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier hit back by warning that the transition was ""not a given"" and that time to secure a deal was ""very short""."

Mr Bolton is not saying that Ms Marney did not write the leaked messages but is to claim she was ""stitched up"" as he fights allegations of having shown ""deeply flawed judgement"". He reportedly broke up with the 25-year-old - who describes herself as a model, actor and journalist - after she caused outcry by stating Harry's ""black American"" fiancee will ""taint"" the Royal Family with ""her seed"" and pave the way for a ""black king"". However, he was seen at restaurants with her following the break-up. Asked if he was still in love with Ms Marney in an interview with Andrew Marr on Sunday, Mr Bolton said: ""There are strong affections there, yes."" Former UKIP leadership candidate Ben Walker has called for Mr Bolton's resignation, accusing him of having ""deeply flawed judgement"". The party is set to hold an emergency general meeting on Saturday 17 February to decide on Mr Bolton's leadership, after he refused to stand down following a vote of no confidence. Sky News understands the UKIP leader is to claim the comments made by Ms Marney took place while she played what a UKIP source described as a ""Cards Against Humanity-style game"" over Facebook messenger, a game similar to the politically incorrect fill-in-the-blank card party game. At the time of the leak, Ms Marney said: ""The opinions I expressed were deliberately exaggerated in order to make a point and have, to an extent, been taken out of context. Yet I fully recognise the offence they have caused."" Mr Bolton has claimed the messages lacked context, and he told Marr ""the source of those tweets has already said publicly that they were doctored"" and that they were not initially public. ""The source of one of those texts, or a couple of them, has said - and they weren't texts by the way, the were private Facebook messages - that they were doctored by him. ""In the days to come, there will be more evidence being presented as to how they were obtained."" Disputing the party wished for Mr Bolton to state his relationship with Ms Marney was over, the UKIP leader added: ""The NEC held a vote of no confidence for a range of reasons. The general consensus was that there was a problem with my judgement around that whole episode."" UKIP should be focused on shaping the debate about Brexit, said Mr Bolton, ""not whether ot not somebody way before I met them actually send private messages that actually had nothing to do with me and I had no means of knowing about them. Mr Bolton said it was ""not the point"" that the relationship was still live."

After purchasing the card, the victim reads off the number, which the fraudster either sells on or uses to purchase high value products. HMRC has written to the chief executives of major retailers, asking them to tell staff about the scam so they can help protect customers. Action Fraud said there has been 1,500 victims, mostly over the age of 65, with an average financial loss of £1,150 though some have lost much more. Following a previous awareness campaign, there have been examples of supermarket staff warning customers they may be falling victim to a scam when they purchase hundreds of pounds of iTunes vouchers. Angela MacDonald, HMRC's director general of customer service, said: ""It's really reassuring to see reports of supermarket staff, off their own back, taking action to keep customers safe. ""Raising public awareness is the best safeguard against this vicious scam. ""Supermarket staff are often the last line of defence against these fraudsters. ""That's why I've written to the chief executives of major UK retailers to urge them to make their staff aware of this scam so they can help protect unsuspecting customers."" HMRC is also tracking down websites being used by the criminals and ""initiating their takedown""."

""That's why I very much hope we get the institutions [devolved government] back up and running. The issues are clear, the issues are resolvable, there is nothing insurmountable, she added.

She described Brexit as ""a disaster"" and said the UK's exit from the EU was ""incompatible"" with the Good Friday Agreement. ""So whatever way this plays out, Irish interests, and by that I mean the bread and butter interests as much as the political interests, demand that the entire island stays inside the customs union and within the single market. ""It is alarming to hear a mantra, coming from London, repeated again and again, that 'we're gone, we're off, we're out', it seems with absolutely no sense of the consequences of that for Ireland."" Ms McDonald, a Member of the Irish Parliament for Dublin Central, said she was hopeful that a referendum on Irish unity would take place during her term in office ""and that we would win it"". Ahead of a referendum on abortion in Ireland later this year, she said: ""I believe in a woman's right to choose and that has been my position for a very, very long time. ""I've expressed that very clearly. My party colleagues are aware of that and that’s the position that I take."" Ms McDonald said Sinn Fein was ""ready and willing"" to be in government in Ireland but that the conversation had moved from which party they would form a coalition with to what that government might be able to deliver."

""There's been such a demand for what we provide to state schools that we're struggling to find enough tutors to teach the game. ""It's just a matter of us having to compete with lots of chess tutors who are in private schools where they can command rather more money than a charity can afford. ""All we're really saying is state schools should get the same opportunity to learn a game that every private school gets to learn."" The popularity of chess has snowballed in the last decade, it now attracts a huge global audience of online players. In the last couple of years, the charity says around 300 primary schools in England have added chess to their curriculum. Gemma Potter, a teacher at Miles Coverdale Primary School in west London, says her pupils can't get enough of it. ""The children are so passionate about it, they've been doing it for three years and they absolutely love it."" For an hour a week her class gets taught how to master problem-solving, as well as learning different techniques, from an experienced tutor in a lesson that's partly subsidised by the charity. ""It's hugely important because the students have to think about cause and effect and think ahead to their next move. A lot of the time children will do something without taking the time to think it through, chess teaches them that they have to think things through carefully, that one move is going to impact another move. ""It helps them to understand that that's what they should do in their lives and in education, that there are steps to go through before they get to their main goal."" The charity says it particularly needs chess tutors in Liverpool, Leeds, Bristol and London. Mr Pein insists giving up a little bit of time can make a big difference. ""One hour a week for one year, and then you've got chess for life."" Wannabe chess teachers can find out more by going to www.chessinschools.co.uk"
2018-02-11,Britain's biggest high street lender‎ will this month become the first FTSE-100 company to set a formal target for the number of non-white people it employs in senior posts.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180211174807/https://news.sky.com/story/lloyds-sets-ethnic-leadership-goal-in-first-for-ftse-100-company-11246607,"Sky News‎ has learnt that Lloyds Banking Group will announce alongside its annual results next week that it wants 8% of its top 7,000 staff to be identified as black, Asian or minority ethnic (BAME) by 2020. The target will be unveiled as part of a new Helping Britain Prosper blueprint to be implemented by Lloyds over the next three years, which will include new goals in areas such as lending to small and medium-sized businesses. Sources said that Antonio Horta-Osorio, Lloyds' chief executive, was determined to establish a meaningful objective for ethnic diversity at a time when workplace discrimination of many kinds is attracting enormous political and public‎ scrutiny. The 8% target for BAME representation in Lloyds' senior ranks is likely to mean appointing roughly 150 more ‎people from ethnic minority backgrounds to leadership roles by the end of the decade. It is also expected to say that it wants 10% of its total workforce of approximately 70,000 ‎to be BAME by 2020. The bank, whose brands include Halifax and Scottish Widows, currently employs 5.6% of senior managers who are BAME, with 8.3% of its overall employee base non-white. Those figures compare to 12%‎ of the existing UK labour force and 14% of the total population who are from ethnic minorities. Lloyds' target is a voluntary one, and the numbers are likely to be skewed by any headcount reductions which take place during the three-year strategic plan for the bank that Mr Horta-Osorio will announce on 21 February. An insider said this weekend that the Lloyds chief, who has steered the bank back to private ownership after eight years in partial taxpayer ownership, would declare an investment programme costing roughly £2.6bn and potentially as much as £3bn. That capital will be deployed in new technology and infrastructure as Lloyds battles the same banking headwinds faced by its rivals across the industry. Its decision to set targets for the proportion of BAME ‎employees follows an objective outlined in 2013 that 40% of senior managers should be female by 2020. The figure now stands at above 34%, while‎ one-third of its nine non-executive board members - although none of its three executive directors - are women. Targets for BAME representation in the upper echelons of British companies have only recently begun to emerge. A review by Sir John Parker, the boardroom grandee who chairs Pennon, the water company, concluded in 2016 that FTSE-100 companies should have at least one non-white board member by 2021. His recommendation was backed by the Government and employers' groups including the CBI. Lloyds declined to comment on Sunday."

2018-02-12,"21st Century Fox (21CF) has offered to strengthen guarantees of Sky News' independence in an attempt to win regulators' backing for its takeover of Sky plc, the UK's biggest pay-television broadcaster.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180212183258/https://news.sky.com/story/cma-publishes-foxs-suggested-remedies-for-sky-bid-11247492,"The US-based media group has tabled a package of what it described as ""firewall remedies"" to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), including a pledge to establish an independent Sky News editorial board that would remain free of any influence by 21CF employees. 21CF would also guarantee the continued funding of Sky-branded news services for at least five years, and would have to disclose any effort to interfere with Sky News' editorial agenda by 21CF to the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. Documents published by the CMA on Monday revealed the additional safeguards proposed by 21CF as it seeks to bring its 14-month pursuit of Sky to a swift conclusion. Sky is 39%-owned by 21CF, controlled by the Murdoch Family Trust - which also controls News Corporation, the publisher of British newspapers including The Sun and The Times. 21CF agreed to buy the remaining 61% of Sky in December 2016, since when a string of regulatory obstacles have forced it to extend its timetable for completing the deal. Last month, the CMA provisionally ruled that the takeover would raise media plurality concerns on the basis that Rupert Murdoch would exert excessive influence over the UK news media. It raised the prospect of behavioural remedies including the ones disclosed on Monday, or a more far-reaching structural solution such as the spin-off or divestiture of Sky News. The latest proposals include a so-called 'sunset clause' relating to the separate agreement between The Walt Disney Company to buy 21CF's entertainment assets - including its 39% Sky stake - for $52bn. Because the larger transaction requires regulatory approval that will not be granted before the CMA must make a final ruling on the takeover of Sky, 21CF has said its independence undertakings relating to Sky News will evaporate if the Disney deal completes. The Disney-21CF transaction will bring together the 20th Century Fox film studio behind hits such as Avatar, X-Men and Ice Age together with Disney's film assets, which include Pixar, Marvel and the Star Wars maker LucasFilm. However, uncertainty relating to that deal has been heightened by reports that Comcast is considering renewing its own pursuit of the 21CF business. The CMA will make its final decision about the Sky takeover, with a report submitted to Matthew Hancock, the Secretary of State, by May 1. Opponents of the deal have continued to argue for the deal's prohibition, including in a joint submission made by politicians including Sir Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, and Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader. The National Union of Journalists also called for the takeover of Sky to be blocked in a response to the CMA published on Monday."

WWF estimates that there are just 20,000 African lions left in the wild, and that 75% of the species' populations are in decline. It means they are officially classed as ""vulnerable"". Other animals regularly targeted by poachers in South Africa's game parks are rhino, to satisfy a booming demand for their horn in China, Vietnam and other Asian countries."

Scotland Yard is ""keen to continue its investigation"", he explained. ""The situation at the moment is that there is Home Office funding to keep Scotland Yard's part of the joint investigation with the Portuguese going until the end of March,"" he said. ""But Scotland Yard has asked for more money."" It is not known how much cash is being requested, and Martin Brunt said it ""may be some time"" before Home Office ministers make a decision.

Six possible theories examined Madeleine was three years of age when she went missing in Praia da Luz in the Algarve in 2007. Last May, on the tenth anniversary of her disappearance, Scotland Yard said it had one critical piece of work still to do, but did not say what it was. Martin Brunt said that as he understood it, it was a ""final theory that was very complicated"", and involved ""a lot of sensitive diplomacy"". It was ""likely to take some time to find the clues, if they were there"". The investigation team, which once numbered 30 officers, is now down to four.

How can Sony Pictures release a film where food allergy bullying is acceptable? I guess the film industry won’t understand how wrong this is till they’re covered in hives and struggling to breathe. #boycottpeterrabbit I think everyone needs to let @SonyPictures know that bullying someone with a food they are deathly allergic to is not funny in any way. Real families deal with the fear of this happening to a family member every day. #shame #boycottpeterrabbit #foodallergiesarenotfunny The filmmakers and the studio, Sony Pictures, have apologised following the outcry over the scene in which Mr McGregor's nephew Thomas is forced to use an EpiPen as a result of the attack. It comes after the charity group Kids with Food Allergies posted a warning about the scene on social media and said it had written a letter to the filmmakers. It wrote in a Facebook post: ""It is unnecessary for a film to show the characters intentionally attacking another with his food allergen to trigger anaphylaxis. ""Portraying anaphylaxis as a joke can cause some people to have a cavalier attitude about food allergies which can put kids with food allergies at risk. ""We are asking filmmakers to work with us to raise awareness about the seriousness of food allergies, and help us promote positive attitudes and safe environments for kids with food allergies."" So you think bullying a person with food allergies is OK?!? My daughter nearly died from one of her food allergies. We are proud to #boycottpeterrabbit due to the insensitivity portrayed. 1 out of every 13 kids in the US live with life threatening food allergies @SonyPictures This is pretty awful. And I don’t have allergies or kids. None needed to see the insensitivity. #boycottpeterrabbit @SonyPictures you are deplorable #boycottpeterrabbit My 2 kids have horrible allergies & u make a joke of it. Not seeing this or any of your movies ever. Honestly not even sure what u were thinking making this scene. 🤔 😡😡 The controversy triggered a mixed reaction and the hashtag #boycottpeterrabbit on social media, with some people describing the scene as ""insensitive"", and others as ""funny"".

Users are increasingly moving to Snapchat, where it is predicted that 43% of British teenagers will log in over the course of 2018 - more than double the numbers in 2015. The statistics are equally true in the US, where for the first time ever fewer than 50% of teenage internet users will log in to Facebook at least once a month. Facebook is still adding monthly users, but they are mainly from older age groups - and not all the young people leaving the platform are going to Facebook-owned Instagram, which is not growing as fast as Snapchat. Facebook's slump follows a move by the company to prioritise ""more meaningful social interactions"", according to chief executive and founder Mark Zuckerberg. Shares fell 4% after he announced the shift. Mr Zuckerberg said ""video and other public content have exploded on Facebook in the past couple of years"", meaning there is ""more public content than posts from your friends and family"". That, he said, has shifted the balance ""away from the most important thing Facebook can do - help us connect with each other"".

Kensington Palace released an update saying that the pair are ""hugely grateful for the many good wishes they have received since announcing their engagement"". ""They are very much looking forward to the day and to being able to share their celebrations with the public,"" it added. The wedding is due to place on the same day as the FA Cup Final at Wembley Stadium. But fans of both football and the Royals can rest easy as a clash is now highly unlikely - recent cup finals have kicked off at 5.30pm and the wedding ceremony is taking place five-and-a-half hours before. As president of the Football Association, the Duke of Cambridge usually attends the FA Cup Final and presents the trophy. But this year, Prince William - who is tipped to be Harry's best man - looks likely to be otherwise engaged with wedding duties. It has also been confirmed that the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will marry the couple. The Rt Rev David Connor, Dean of Windsor, will also conduct the service at the 15th century historic chapel. Arrangements for the day include a procession at 1pm when the newly married couple will leave the chapel, go through the castle gates, and follow a loop back around the town. The route includes Castle Hill, High Street, Sheet Street, Kings Road, Albert Road and Long Walk. The Palace said that Harry and Meghan ""hope this short journey will provide an opportunity for more people to come together around Windsor and to enjoy the atmosphere of this special day"". There will then be a reception at St George's Hall for the pair and their congregation guests. Later Prince Charles will give a private evening reception for the couple and their close friends and family. Alastair Bruce, royal commentator, said: ""A wedding is a wedding but for the Royal Family there is always an element of public interest. ""The structure of putting together a ceremony that follows a traditional path is very much what is kind of expected. ""So I think that the planning here has followed some of the traditions of the past and using the shape of the castle both to have a private event and the streets outside to make that public element work so well."" Roya Nikkhah, royal correspondent for the Sunday Times, said the wedding is expected to have much more of a ""showbusiness"" feel. ""I've reported that Meghan is going to give a speech at her wedding that is very different from what we have seen before. ""I think it will have a slightly more modern twist than previous royal weddings and we are seeing that with this update with the carriage process to involve the public. ""That is a new departure."" Harry and Meghan have chosen a Saturday, which is also against tradition, as royal weddings usually take place on a week day. Already shops in Windsor are making plans. Aamir Bukhri, owner of the Chippy of Windsor, said he was planning to decorate the front of his shop. ""Windsor has just gone to a different stage, it is reborn, it's a new introduction,"" he said. ""We are going to put up British flags, some pictures as well outside, and some nice flowers, and some bunting. ""We are hoping this summer will be very busy here and we are feeling that because a lot of people are already coming in and talking about (the wedding)."""

2018-02-12,Mark Carney has put the country on notice - the cost of borrowing is going to rise more rapidly than the Bank of England indicated only three months ago.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180212183258/https://news.sky.com/story/what-the-interest-rates-rise-warning-means-for-you-11241571,"In some ways, this is good news. Interest rates need to go up more quickly than expected because the Bank expects the economy to grow more strongly than expected this year. Unemployment is at its lowest for 43 years and, finally, wages are starting to pick up - as one would expect when the jobless rate is so low. That's the good news. The bad news is that this growth performance is due, in the Monetary Policy Committee's view, mainly because the global economy is growing more strongly than anticipated rather than because of anything we are doing at home. And, because of the UK's mediocre productivity record, the predicted rise in average earnings is, in the MPC's opinion, likely to feed into higher inflation. So the rate needs to go up. This begs the question: when will the Bank next raise the cost of borrowing? The market was putting the chances of an interest rate rise in May at 50/50 even before the Bank's inflation report, but now sees the chance of a rate rise that month as more probable than that, while a rate rise in August - a month after Mr Carney celebrates his fifth anniversary of becoming governor - is seen as a done deal. Even a rise from 0.5% to 0.75% will feed through into higher mortgage rates. Swap rates, which mortgage lenders use to price their fixed-rate home loans, have already been rising with, for example, the two-year rate more than doubling during the last 18 months. So anyone whose fixed-rate home loan is up for renewal before August should be looking right now to lock in the current rates. Likewise, mortgage borrowers on a variable-rate deal might also want to think about moving to a fixed-rate deal. For savers, the decision is less obvious. Many savings accounts are already loss-leaders for banks and building societies and so they are less likely than mortgage lenders to pass on any rise in interest rates. Anyone with both a mortgage and a decent slug of money in a savings account may be better off going for an offset mortgage. And no homeowner should be expecting much of an increase in house prices any time soon. As for investors, this may not necessarily be good news, certainly if their investments are predominantly in the FTSE-100 or funds that track its performance. One big lesson since the Brexit vote is the extent to which the Footsie moves in inverse proportion to the pound, because it is full of big multinationals that make a lot of their sales in dollars and euros, so any drop in the pound flatters those earnings. By the same token, a rise in the pound depresses those earnings in sterling terms, which is partly why Thursday's rise in the pound against both the dollar and the euro has been matched by an almost equal and opposite move in the Footsie. Higher inflation is also the enemy of the bond investor and so anyone with fixed-rate savings accounts, or money in UK gilts, will not welcome Thursday's news. Higher interest rates also mean higher borrowing costs for business, so the already anaemic rate of business investment - something Mr Carney blames for the UK's lacklustre productivity growth - looks set to continue, unless companies can find good and specific reasons to invest. If all that sounds too depressing for words, there is one over-riding reason to be cheerful about what Mr Carney has said today. The UK has just gone through a period, lasting nearly nine years, during which interest rates were held at record low levels. They were kept at those levels because the Bank of England's policy-makers were more frightened about deflation than inflation. That we are now moving - albeit very slowly - to what is a more 'normalised' interest rate environment is undeniably welcome. And one more piece of good news: higher interest rates not only ought to mean higher annuity rates for those coming up for retirement, they should also mean that pension fund deficits (because scheme liabilities are linked to gilt yields) should also, all other things being equal, start to fall. That will be excellent news for companies and, potentially, free up more capital to be invested in profitable activities rather than simply filling in pension deficits."

The couple immediately alerted police, and officers arrested Subacius and seized his phone. It contained the video, messages demanding money and threats to cause the toddler further harm. The girl was examined by medics who found a further eight healed fractures including to her femur, wrist, collar bone and ribs, police said.

She said she was sorry for the ""harm and distress"" it had caused supporters. The announcement comes after talks between Oxfam bosses and ministers on Monday and amid continuing criticism of the charity's response to the allegations. The Times reported last week that senior aid workers had used prostitutes in Haiti during the relief effort after the devastating earthquake in 2010, something which is illegal. :: Oxfam sex scandal 'tip of iceberg' as bosses hauled in to see ministers An internal investigation by the charity into sexual exploitation, the downloading of pornography, bullying and intimidation is claimed to have found children may have been exploited by employees. Oxfam has since faced further allegations that prostitutes were also used by staff in Chad in 2006. The claims continued on Monday, with allegations the charity was aware of concerns about the conduct of two of men at the centre of the Haiti allegations when they previously worked in Chad. Oxfam has denied trying to cover up the use of prostitutes by staff in Haiti and has announced measures to try to improve safeguarding at the charity. :: Oxfam boss 'deeply ashamed' of charity's behaviour In a statement, Ms Lawrence said: ""Over the last few days we have become aware that concerns were raised about the behaviour of staff in Chad, as well as Haiti, that we failed to adequately act upon. ""It is now clear that these allegations - involving the use of prostitutes and which related to behaviour of both the Country Director and members of his team in Chad - were raised before he moved to Haiti. ""As programme director at the time, I am ashamed that this happened on my watch and I take full responsibility. ""I am desperately sorry for the harm and distress that this has caused to Oxfam's supporters, the wider development sector and most of all the vulnerable people who trusted us."" International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt said the charity had lied and failed in its ""moral leadership"" by not fully disclosing details of its investigation to the relevant authorities. She called the behaviour ""utterly despicable"" and threatened to cut the charity off from Government funding if she was unsatisfied with the answers from Monday's meeting. The Charity Commission has also said it was not told the full story when Oxfam first looked into the allegations in 2011. Four members of staff were dismissed and three, including the country director Roland van Hauwermeiren, resigned before the end of the probe. Ms Mordaunt's predecessor told Sky News that senior officials had ""pushed back"" against an inquiry into alleged abuse. Priti Patel said ""a lot of people knew about this"", and added in a Daily Telegraph article that the Oxfam claims are ""only the tip of the iceberg"". Ms Mordaunt has defended her department, saying she first heard about the claims when they were made in The Times. Following Ms Patel's claims, Downing Street refused to say if the Prime Minister retained full confidence in senior officials at the Department of International Development (DfID). When asked, a Number 10 spokesman said: ""The Prime Minister, of course, has full confidence in the Secretary of State to lead this department, a department which has already taken action on this issue."""

Last August, Sky News revealed that police held more than 20 million facial recognition images, including on innocent people - despite a High Court ruling in 2012 said that holding these was unlawful. It took the Government until 2017 before it revisited the policy in its Review of Custody Images. The review informed the police that, contrary to the High Court judgment, they could carry on retaining innocent citizens' photographs for six years unless citizens directly applied to have their images removed. When the review was published, the Home Office was warned that innocent people who were entitled to have their images deleted were unlikely to hear about the law. Campaigners, including Big Brother Watch, argued that the images of innocent people needed to be automatically deleted. The organisation's director, Silkie Carlo, said: ""The miniscule number of photos deleted is the unsurprising result of the Home Office's obstructive, failed policy."" The independent Biometrics Commissioner warned that public confidence in law enforcement was being undermined by the lack of laws controlling the police's use of facial recognition technology, which can identify individuals from live CCTV footage. A Biometrics Strategy to introduce regulation of the technology is now five years late. Norman Lamb MP, chair of the science and technology committee, said that the Government's delay in publishing the strategy was ""intolerable"" as the Government promises to attempt to publish the document this year. A Home Office spokesperson said: ""When doing so it is important that the police act legally, ethically, and transparently. ""We are examining whether, with new police IT systems, it will be technically feasible to link custody images to conviction status as is the case with fingerprints and DNA."""
2018-02-12,A victim of the helicopter crash in the Grand Canyon was celebrating his 30th birthday when he was killed alongside his girlfriend and brother.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180212183258/https://news.sky.com/story/brothers-and-girlfriend-killed-in-grand-canyon-helicopter-crash-11247588,"Stuart Hill was with girlfriend Becky Dobson, 27, and older brother Jason Hill, 32, when their Papillon tour helicopter came down at about 5.20pm on Saturday. They were killed instantly. Three other friends, also from the UK, and the pilot are fighting for their lives in hospital. Ms Dobson was an animal lover who worked as a receptionist at Vets4Pets in Worthing, West Sussex. She dreamed of becoming a veterinary nurse, and in a biography on the practice's website she said she loved spending time with her horse, Buddy, as well as her friends and family, and travelling. Ms Dobson's father Peter Dobson said Becky was ""full of life and looking forward to going to Vegas for her boyfriend's 30th birthday to celebrate"". ""She was always happy,"" he said. ""They were really happy together, they were always going out and doing things, just enjoyed being with each other."" Stuart and Jason were originally from Worthing. Stuart worked at Lookers, a large car retailer, while his brother worked for law firm Shoosmiths, most recently at the firm's Milton Keynes branch. Their father, the Reverend David Hill, told the Evening Standard Jason was about to become a partner in the law firm. The Rev Hill told the Standard: ""The two brothers loved each other and were very close, and so our misfortune is their support - because they went together, and I will thank God every day for them."" He said they had saved for a year to go on the trip and were there as a group of six. Losing his sons felt like a ""light had gone out"", he said. The three other friends injured in the crash remain in intensive care. Ellie Milward, 29, Jonathan Udall, 32, and Jennifer Barham, 39, were airlifted to University Medical Centre in Las Vegas, Nevada, along with pilot Scott Booth, 42. National Transportation Safety Board investigator Stephen Stein said detectives were ""working very closely to obtain statements, which will happen hopefully within the next few days or whenever they do make a timely recovery"". ""Their safety is very important to us. We want to make sure we do not rush the recovery."" Mr Stein would not speculate on what may have caused the crash, though he said a preliminary report will be ready in the coming days. UPDATE:  First Images of downed Papillon aircraft near #GrandCanyon - Pic courtesy Teddy Fujimoto pic.twitter.com/zhRlnDDcx3 Police said the injured had to wait eight hours for emergency services to tend to them, as conditions made the crash site difficult to get to. One witness saw a woman crawl out of the wreckage and shout ""Jason"" as the helicopter went up in flames around her. Mr Udall's father Philip told the MailOnline his son and daughter-in-law Ms Milward were on their honeymoon. He said: ""We have spoken to the hospital and they are in a critical condition but they told us they are currently stable."" Hualapai police chief Francis Bradley said: ""Yesterday, we were hampered by severe weather conditions, we had gusts up to 50mph. The terrain where the crash occurred...is extremely rugged."" Dreadful news of the helicopter crash in the Grand Canyon involving six British nationals. My thoughts are with their families and friends. UK consular staff are providing assistance and we have a team in the area. Thank you to the US emergency services for their support. Photos of the crash scene taken by witness Teddy Fujimoto showed flames and dark smoke rising from the rocky terrain. Mr Fujimoto, a Las Vegas photographer, was taking pictures for a wedding shoot when he heard people shouting and saw them running towards the edge of a ravine. ""There was a helicopter, flames, smoke,"" he said. ""It was horrible... unimaginable."" In a statement, Papillon Group chief executive Brenda Halvorson said: ""It is with extreme sadness we extend our heartfelt sympathy to the families involved in this accident. ""Our top priority is the care and needs of our passengers and our staff."" One witness, Kaitlyn Rodriguez, wrote on Facebook: ""I was on this tour and moments after our helicopter landed, witnessed the crash. ""My amazingly brave mother, along with several others, trekked down into the ravine to assist the survivors. We were stranded in the Grand Canyon for hours, my mom being at the bottom administering medical attention to the survivors for over 10 hours. ""So very proud of her and all who helped the victims of the crash. Such a tragic accident."" UPDATE#2: Another image from wreckage of tour helicopter crash in Grand Canyon.

An investigation will take place into the crash. The cause is currently unknown, but a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman said the helicopter had sustained ""heavy damage""."

We will watch no longer. ""You have taken lives on our side. Now we will take lives on yours. ""We are coming for you.""

The Guido Fawkes website reported six prominent Leave donors had also received similar letters. Late last year, Remain-supporting Conservative backbencher Dominic Grieve was forced to report death threats to police after leading efforts to defeat the Government on flagship Brexit legislation. Other Tory Remainer rebels, who have been dubbed ""mutineers"", have also previously revealed death threats. Ms Leadsom was a prominent member of the Vote Leave campaign during the EU referendum and argued for Brexit in a national TV debate. She also challenged Theresa May for the Conservative leadership in 2016 before withdrawing from the race. Last week, the Prime Minister used a speech marking the centenary of some women being given the vote to warn of a ""coarsening"" of public debate. ""The ideal of a truly plural and open public sphere where everyone can take part is in danger,"" Theresa May said. ""A tone of bitterness and aggression has entered into our public debate. ""In public life, and increasingly in private conversations too, it is becoming harder and harder to conduct any political discussion, on any issue, without it descending into tribalism and rancour. ""Participants in local and national public life - from candidates and elected representatives to campaigners, journalists and commentators - have to contend with regular and sustained abuse.

The South West, Wales and the southern Midlands were warned to prepare for ice overnight with temperatures down to -3C (27F). The North West, North Wales, western Scotland and Northern Ireland were told to expect equally cold temperatures and widespread snow showers. Parts of Scotland could see the mercury fall as low as -6C (21F), the Met Office said. An icy cold wind chill will leave many parts of the UK feeling several degrees Celsius colder than their actual temperatures. Sky's Weather Producer Joanna Robinson said: ""Sunday evening will be cold and blustery, with hail, sleet and snow showers becoming increasingly confined to the West. ""It will be largely dry overnight, but Ireland, Northern Ireland, western Scotland and northwest England will see further wintry showers. A covering of snow is possible there. ""Clear skies will bring a widespread frost, locally severe in Scotland, with icy stretches in the West."" The Met Office said: ""Icy patches are expected to form on untreated roads, pavements and cycle paths on Sunday night and Monday morning. This is likely to lead to some injuries from slips and falls."" On Sunday, snow showers caused disruption on the roads with North West Motorway Police tweeting there were ""numerous reports"" of accidents on the roads due to the conditions, and urged drivers to slow down. The Met Office warned of the potential for power cuts, as well as vehicles becoming stranded on the roads. Milder temperatures are set to return mid-week."

The positive tone was echoed by the DUP's Arlene Foster and Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald, while Irish PM Leo Varadkar said he was ""very hopeful"" of a deal being struck this week. :: Analysis: Sinn Fein leader insists she's nobody's puppet It is 13 months since Northern Ireland's devolved government collapsed, after Ms Foster refused to stand down as First Minister over a botched renewable energy scheme The involvement of the British and Irish PMs in Monday's discussions raised speculation that an agreement could be imminent. But while such hopes proved unfounded, all parties said an accord was in sight. Ms Foster said her party wanted a deal that was ""good for everyone"" and ""sustainable"" in the long-term, telling reporters: ""Good progress has been made and we will continue to work towards more progress. :: McDonald 'ready to do business' with Foster ""It is about finding an accommodation that recognises the need to respect all languages and all cultures in Northern Ireland and not allow one to dominate over another."" Ms Foster, who described the tone of the discussions as ""very good"", added: ""There isn't a deal yet but there is very good progress and we will keep at it and continue to work on that progress."" A similar view was expressed by Ms McDonald, who said: ""We believe that we are close to an agreement which, certainly, we can put to our grassroots and to the community as a whole."" The Sinn Fein leader acknowledged ""we are not exactly there just yet"", but ""there is nothing insurmountable if there is the political will to reach an agreement"". Ms McDonald said there were no direct talks between her party and the DUP on Monday, adding: ""Clearly we need to meet, clearly we need to resolve the outstanding issues."" Sinn Fein has been steadfast in its refusal to resume power-sharing without a commitment to introduce both an Irish Language Act and same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland. Last month, the new Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley told the parties time was short but ""one last opportunity to reach agreement"" remained. Without an agreement on devolved government soon, Northern Ireland faces the very real prospect of a return to direct rule from Westminster for the first time in a decade."

New York painter Kehinde Wiley, known for his naturalistic artwork depicting black people in heroic and triumphant poses, was tasked with Mr Obama's portrait. ""I tried to negotiate less grey hairs, but Kehinde's integrity would not allow him to do what I asked,"" joked Mr Obama. He described the portrait, which depicts him sitting on a wooden chair against a colourful, leafy backdrop, as ""extraordinary"", adding: ""It's my great honour to be here. It means so much to us."" Mr Wiley, a Yale University graduate, took thousands of photographs of the 44th US president in order to perfect the portrait, which will be on show in the America's Presidents exhibition. Baltimore artist Amy Sherald was commissioned to do Mrs Obama's portrait, less than two years after she became the first to win the National Portrait Gallery's Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition. ""I'm a little overwhelmed, humbled and proud,"" said Mrs Obama, who praised the portrait as ""amazing"". Addressing Ms Sherald, Mr Obama added: ""I want to thank you for so spectacularly capturing the grace, and beauty, and intelligence, and charm... and hotness, of the woman that I love. ""I am in awe of Kehinde's gifts, and what he and Amy have given to this country and to the world, and we are both very grateful to have been the focus of their attention for this moment.""

The ejector seat's parachute failed to deploy, sending South African-born Mr Cunningham falling 200ft. In January, Martin-Baker Aircraft Company Ltd admitted failing to ensure the safety of non-employees in connection with the death of Mr Cunningham, 35. On the first day of a two-day sentencing hearing, Lincoln Crown Court heard the company had agreed to pay £550,000 in prosecution costs. However, despite their guilty plea, they dispute some of the prosecution's allegations. Prosecutor Rex Tedd QC said the company had a duty to ""ensure none of the pilots"" were exposed to a health and safety risk. ""The defendant accepts that the risk persisted for a long period,"" he said. ""If the pilot was ejected from the Hawk aircraft, two shackles would not release from one another and would jam together and the main parachute would not deploy. ""The pilot would be several hundred feet in the air and there could only be one result of that - that is the pilot's death."" Middlesex-based Martin-Baker describes itself on its website as a family-run business and the ""world leader in the design and manufacture of ejection and crash-worthy seats"". The court heard the company had ""undoubtedly saved the lives of many pilots"" since inventing the ejector seat. After last month's guilty plea, Martin-Baker said that in the past 73 years, its ejection seats had been flown by 92 air forces, with more than 17,000 seats currently in use. They also said that the malfunction in the Mark 10B seat was ""an isolated failure relating to the tightening of a nut during maintenance procedures conducted by RAF aerobatic team mechanics"". But Mr Tedd claimed in court that there had instead been a ""risk to many pilots over a lengthy period"". ""The defendant's failure was anything but isolated,"" he said. The sentencing continues."

She had not been seen for 11 days. Family and friends launched a massive campaign to find the 19-year-old student, who suffered from severe epilepsy. Two men aged 19 and 49, and a 71-year-old woman were arrested but released without charge. Gaia's body was found by police in undergrowth between Dancing Ledge and Anvil Point, close to the Swanage coastal path, on 18 November. Her family said they wanted to know more about the circumstances of her death, saying she had been ""really struggling"" with a ""lot of issues"". The only family at the opening of the inquest at Bournemouth Town Hall were her cousin Marienna Pope-Weidemann and her mother Talia Pope. ""I am aware the family have a number of concerns in relation to Gaia's death and some of those will be very relevant to my inquiry, but some will not be,"" said Dorset Coroner Rachael Griffin ""It is not that I am unsympathetic to those concerns but they simply fall outside my remit."" Coroner's officer Andrew Lord said that pathologist Dr Russell Delaney was initially unable to establish a cause of death. But after tests he was able to say that Miss Pope had died from hypothermia. Mr Lord said she was formally identified by a ""distinctive"" tattoo on her body. ""Following the results of the post-mortem examination police have confirmed they are no longer treating the death as suspicious,"" Mr Lord said. Miss Griffin said she would be requesting statements from Miss Pope's family, her GP, the Dorset Healthcare University NHS Foundation Trust, Dorset Police and Professor Matthew Walker, a neurologist from University College London who Miss Pope was under the care of. ""It has been brought to my attention that there are some concerns in relation to care provided by social services,"" she said. ""I will request a statement from Dorset County Council in relation to that contact with Gaia."" The coroner added that she would also want an entomology report to see whether the exact timing of Miss Pope's death could be established. The coroner adjourned the hearing until 14 May for a pre-inquest review and she had not fixed a date for the resumed inquest. Gaia's cousin, Marienna Pope-Weidemann, said after the hearing: ""We know now what took her from us but when, how and why are all questions that must still be answered, not just for our sake but for the sake of the next family who wakes up in that nightmare some day. ""We are hopeful that the inquest will find those answers. The road is long but with your support we will get justice for Gaia."""

2018-02-13,Inflation remained unchanged at 3% last month adding further pressure on the Bank of England for an interest rate rise.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180213192650/https://news.sky.com/story/inflation-remains-steady-at-3-in-january-11248684,"Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation was driven up by expensive tickets to family attractions though this was offset by weaker fuel price rises. It meant CPI remained one percentage point higher than the Bank of England's 2% target. Economists had on average expected it to fall back slightly to 2.9%. Inflation reached its highest level since 2012 in November at 3.1% and it has since remained stubbornly close to that level. Prices have been pushed higher since the Brexit referendum in June 2016 resulted in a collapse in the value of the pound, making imports more expensive. In January, the main upward pressure came from the cost of entrance fees to recreational venues such as zoos and gardens, for which prices fell by less than they did a year ago. There were also weaker drops in the price of clothing and air fares compared with the same month last year.. CPI measures the growth in the price of everyday items including fuel, food, clothing and household goods. The latest figures show a continuation in the squeeze on household budgets, as the rise in the cost of living remains higher than wage growth. Sterling rose 0.3% against the dollar to $1.38 following the figures. Against the euro, the pound was trading flat at €1.12. Last week the Bank of England - which raised interest rates in November for the first time since 2007 from 0.25% to 0.5% - signalled that a further hike might come sooner rather than later. Many experts now expect an increase to come in May. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said following the latest inflation: ""Inflation's now been above target for 12 straight months. ""This adds further weight to the case for higher interest rates sooner rather than later."" Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said a May rate rise was ""by no means a done deal"" and the Bank would want to see ""the economy's health improve to be sufficiently reassured that the economy is ready for another rise in borrowing costs"". Mel Stride, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, said: ""The good news is that inflation is expected to fall this year. ""We are helping cut costs for hard pressed families by boosting pay, cutting taxes for millions of people and freezing fuel duty at the pumps. This is all part of our plan to build an economy that works for everyone."""

However, despite his deputy Penny Lawrence having resigned on Monday, Mr Goldring intends to remain in post during the crisis unless he is told to go by the charity's board. On Tuesday, he was offered strong support by Oxfam's chair of trustees Caroline Thomson. ""We have complete confidence in Mark Goldring, he's doing a brilliant job and Oxfam's a wonderful organisation which is going through some difficult times,"" she told Sky News. Ms Thomson described the charity as ""very ashamed"" by claims senior aid workers used prostitutes in Haiti, amid an international relief effort in 2011. But she added: ""We're going to move on and, I hope, continue to earn… the support of the British public."" The Haiti revelations, first reported by The Times newspaper, sparked further claims prostitutes were also used by Oxfam staff in Chad in 2006. Although the allegations refer to events before his tenure, Mr Goldring has since been directly dragged into the controversy after a whistleblower claimed he failed to act on concerns raised to him in 2014. Helen Evans, Oxfam's former global head of safeguarding between 2012 and 2015, claimed she begged the charity's bosses, ministers and the regulator to act on sexual abuse allegations. She said that while she was working at Oxfam she was told of three examples of sexual misconduct in the space of 24 hours. Ms Evans claimed she was told about two women being coerced to have sex and a worker who had failed to say he had previously been struck off for sex abuse. She also detailed concerns about abuse of staff as young as 14 in Oxfam shops. In response to her allegations, Mr Goldring apologised for ""not acting fast enough"" on her concerns, after Ms Evans claimed Oxfam bosses cancelled a meeting with her at the last moment. He told Channel 4 News: ""I think we did take them seriously and we responded on many different fronts - the records checking was one of them, training was another, the promotion of the helpline was another - she did some great work. ""What I recognise now, with the severity of issues as they have emerged, is that we should have resourced that team up faster as we now have, indeed, done."" Saying he would not resign as he was not in post at the time of the Haiti allegations from 2011, Mr Goldring added: ""If our board turn round and say 'actually you are not the right person to lead us forward' then I of course would resign immediately."" Mr Goldring is likely to be among senior Oxfam figures to face a grilling by MPs next week, as the House of Commons' International Development Committee meets on Tuesday in response to the charity's ongoing scandal. Haiti, which suffered a devastating earthquake in 2010, has sent a warning to international aid agencies following the claims against Oxfam. Hitting out at ""a violation of basic human decency"", the Caribbean country's president Jovenel Moise said in a statement: ""Let this be well-understood by all agencies: if your staff exploits or harms our communities while 'aiding' them, we will not tolerate your particular brand of support."" Oxfam's leaders in Haiti are expected to be called in for crisis talks with Mr Moise's government. The charity's reputation suffered a further blow on Tuesday after Juan Alberto Fuentes, chairman of Oxfam International, was arrested in Guatemala as part of a local corruption investigation. Mr Goldring met with International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt on Monday, who has said she is taking the crisis ""very seriously"" but insisted she will not act ""hastily"" when deciding whether or not to stop handing Government aid cash to Oxfam. Oxfam received £31.7m of taxpayers' cash in 2016/17, with its funding part of the Government's £13bn per year foreign aid budget. Former international development secretary Justine Greening has said she does not recall being aware of allegations surrounding Oxfam workers in Haiti. Speaking to Sky News, the Tory MP said she was ""absolutely shocked"" to hear the claims and insisted any allegations ""would have been followed up"". Ms Greening spoke out after her successor Priti Patel claimed Oxfam's prostitution scandal is ""only the tip of the iceberg"" and warned there has been a ""culture of denial"" in the aid sector about exploitation and sexual abuse over decades. An inquiry into the Oxfam sex scandal by the Charity Commission was due to get under way on Tuesday."
2018-02-13,Network Rail is planning to deliver a 15% reduction in delayed trains under a £47bn five-year plan - but has made no fresh promises of major projects.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180213192650/https://news.sky.com/story/network-rail-aims-to-cut-delays-and-add-services-in-47bn-five-year-plan-11249143,"The bulk of its 2019-24 budget will be spent on maintenance and day-to-day operations to try to improve performance on the existing railway. By 2021, it aims to increase the number of services by 350,000 per year or nearly 1,000 a day. It is planning a 25% increase in funding ""to reduce delays and improve infrastructure reliability"". The strategy includes £10bn for ""enhancements"" or rail upgrades, most of which will be projects deferred from the 2014-19 plan. That strategy was described as the biggest investment in railways since the Victorian era - but many initiatives were shelved or delayed. Key works in the new five-year plan are likely to include the TransPennine line from Leeds to Manchester, currently awaiting Government sign-off. Network Rail said the plan would drive economic growth, jobs and housing ""by delivering a better railway for the millions of people who rely on it"". It is subject to review by the Office of Rail and Road ahead of a final determination in the autumn. Network Rail chief executive Mark Carne said it was ""an ambitious, but realistic plan that is not without challenge"". Passenger numbers have doubled in the last 20 years and are set to rise by around by 40% by 2040. Mr Carne said: ""Britain's railways have seen a revival over the past decade or so and we have been working flat-out over the last five years to build new stations and new infrastructure to enable thousands of more services to come on stream to soak up that demand. ""For the next five years we need to relentlessly focus on making our railway more reliable while also ushering in new digital technology that with help to transform our railway in the years ahead."" Publicly-owned Network Rail owns and operates the railway infrastructure in England, Wales and Scotland."
2018-02-13,Mark Carney has put the country on notice - the cost of borrowing is going to rise more rapidly than the Bank of England indicated only three months ago.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180213192650/https://news.sky.com/story/what-the-interest-rates-rise-warning-means-for-you-11241571,"In some ways, this is good news. Interest rates need to go up more quickly than expected because the Bank expects the economy to grow more strongly than expected this year. Unemployment is at its lowest for 43 years and, finally, wages are starting to pick up - as one would expect when the jobless rate is so low. That's the good news. The bad news is that this growth performance is due, in the Monetary Policy Committee's view, mainly because the global economy is growing more strongly than anticipated rather than because of anything we are doing at home. And, because of the UK's mediocre productivity record, the predicted rise in average earnings is, in the MPC's opinion, likely to feed into higher inflation. So the rate needs to go up. This begs the question: when will the Bank next raise the cost of borrowing? The market was putting the chances of an interest rate rise in May at 50/50 even before the Bank's inflation report, but now sees the chance of a rate rise that month as more probable than that, while a rate rise in August - a month after Mr Carney celebrates his fifth anniversary of becoming governor - is seen as a done deal. Even a rise from 0.5% to 0.75% will feed through into higher mortgage rates. Swap rates, which mortgage lenders use to price their fixed-rate home loans, have already been rising with, for example, the two-year rate more than doubling during the last 18 months. So anyone whose fixed-rate home loan is up for renewal before August should be looking right now to lock in the current rates. Likewise, mortgage borrowers on a variable-rate deal might also want to think about moving to a fixed-rate deal. For savers, the decision is less obvious. Many savings accounts are already loss-leaders for banks and building societies and so they are less likely than mortgage lenders to pass on any rise in interest rates. Anyone with both a mortgage and a decent slug of money in a savings account may be better off going for an offset mortgage. And no homeowner should be expecting much of an increase in house prices any time soon. As for investors, this may not necessarily be good news, certainly if their investments are predominantly in the FTSE-100 or funds that track its performance. One big lesson since the Brexit vote is the extent to which the Footsie moves in inverse proportion to the pound, because it is full of big multinationals that make a lot of their sales in dollars and euros, so any drop in the pound flatters those earnings. By the same token, a rise in the pound depresses those earnings in sterling terms, which is partly why Thursday's rise in the pound against both the dollar and the euro has been matched by an almost equal and opposite move in the Footsie. Higher inflation is also the enemy of the bond investor and so anyone with fixed-rate savings accounts, or money in UK gilts, will not welcome Thursday's news. Higher interest rates also mean higher borrowing costs for business, so the already anaemic rate of business investment - something Mr Carney blames for the UK's lacklustre productivity growth - looks set to continue, unless companies can find good and specific reasons to invest. If all that sounds too depressing for words, there is one over-riding reason to be cheerful about what Mr Carney has said today. The UK has just gone through a period, lasting nearly nine years, during which interest rates were held at record low levels. They were kept at those levels because the Bank of England's policy-makers were more frightened about deflation than inflation. That we are now moving - albeit very slowly - to what is a more 'normalised' interest rate environment is undeniably welcome. And one more piece of good news: higher interest rates not only ought to mean higher annuity rates for those coming up for retirement, they should also mean that pension fund deficits (because scheme liabilities are linked to gilt yields) should also, all other things being equal, start to fall. That will be excellent news for companies and, potentially, free up more capital to be invested in profitable activities rather than simply filling in pension deficits."
2018-02-13,"A Red Arrows pilot who died after the parachute on his ejector seat failed to deploy was the victim of a fault that would only happen ""once every 115 years"", a court heard.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180213192650/https://news.sky.com/story/fatal-red-arrows-incident-would-only-happen-once-every-115-years-11249083,"South African-born flight lieutenant Sean Cunningham died after being ejected from his Hawk T1 aircraft during pre-flight checks at RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire in November 2011. The parachute attached to the Mark 10B ejector seat - manufactured by the Martin-Baker Aircraft Company - did not deploy, leaving the 25-year-old to fall 200ft to the ground. He later died in hospital. Defence lawyer Richard Matthews told Lincoln Crown Court that the aircraft firm accepted responsibility for the ""significant contribution and failings it has made"" in relation to Mr Cunningham's death, having already agreed to pay £550,000 in prosecution costs But he added that the Ministry of Defence (MoD) had assessed that such an incident was exceptionally rare. Speaking on the second day of a two-day sentencing hearing, Mr Matthews said: ""In the 1990s, what Martin-Baker had in place was a good system and it just failed in this instance. ""The MoD's assessment of the likelihood of a similar event such as this happening is that it would only happen once every 115 years."" Middlesex-based Martin-Baker describes itself on its website as a family-run business and the ""world leader in the design and manufacture of ejection and crash-worthy seats"". The court heard on Monday that the company had ""undoubtedly saved the lives of many pilots"" since inventing the ejector seat, and after last month's guilty plea the firm revealed that its ejection seats had been used by 92 air forces in the past 73 years. Mr Matthews added: ""The ethos of the company from its inception is for the ejection seat to be a lifeboat that should operate effectively in every situation. ""Nobody can convey the sadness, regret and the apology on behalf of the company and all those who stand behind it. I know you will accept that it is in enormous."" At a previous hearing on 22 January, John Martin, director of the Middlesex-based firm, admitted there had been a failure to ensure the safety of non-employees. The sentencing hearing continues."

It is alleged that a 27-year-old man suffered a fractured eye socket during the incident, which happened several hours after England had played a one-day international against the West Indies at Bristol's Brightside Ground. Stokes is accused of affray - which effectively amounts to public fighting - alongside Ryan Ali, 28, and Ryan Hale, 26, who also pleaded not guilty. The charge states that their ""conduct was such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his personal safety"". The case will be heard at Bristol Crown Court on 12 March, with all three men on bail until then, but Stokes will not be required to appear. If found guilty by a jury, the offence carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison. In a statement posted on Twitter last month, Stokes said he was ""keen to have an opportunity to clear my name"". The Durham all-rounder is set to make his England return in the one-day series against New Zealand on 25 February after being included in the 15-man squad. An ECB spokesman confirmed: ""Having entered his plea at Bristol Magistrates Court today, Ben Stokes will now travel to New Zealand to join the England squad. ""He departs tomorrow, Wednesday 14 February, and will arrive on Friday 16 February, ready to train with England teammates in Hamilton. ""Any decision to include him in upcoming matches will be made by Head Coach Trevor Bayliss and the England management team. He is not currently being considered for the ongoing International T20 Tri-Series. ""ECB fully respects his right to defend himself in court and any obligations he has within the legal process will always take precedence over England commitments."" Stokes is also due to play in the Indian Premier League when it begins in April after being sold for £1.4m to the Rajasthan Royals."

They were wanted in connection with the torture and beheading of dozens of people - including US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, and British aid workers Alan Henning and David Haines. The murder squad they were part of, which also included Mohammed Emwazi - known as ""Jihadi John"" - and Aine Davis, was nicknamed ""The Beatles"" because of the jihadists' English accents. All four are believed to have grown up in the same part of west London. :: Who are the IS fighters nicknamed 'The Beatles' Last week, it was reported the Home Office had taken the unusual step of stripping both Kotey and Elsheikh of their UK citizenship, which was said to have made it a lot less likely they will be returned to Britain to face trial. However, the US is putting pressure on international partners to take back foreign Islamic State fighters captured in the Middle East. Pentagon official Kathy Wheelbarger, who will join US defence secretary James Mattis at a summit in Rome on Tuesday, said: ""We are working with the coalition on foreign fighter detainees and generally expect those detainees to return to their country of origin for disposition."" The American position could be resisted by Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, who will also attend the gathering in Italy. The Cabinet minister has said he does not think Kotey and Elsheikh ""should ever set foot in this country again"". Tobias Ellwood, a minister in Mr Williamson's department, has suggested captured jihadists should be sent to the International Criminal Court in The Hague, although the US does not recognise the court. The Tory MP criticised the previous sending of terror detainees to Guantanamo Bay, which Donald Trump has vowed to keep open. Home Secretary Amber Rudd promised Kotey and Elsheikh will ""face justice"" but refused to say where they will be brought before a court. She told Sky News: ""The important thing is that these two people face justice. We will always make sure it's properly coordinated and that they face justice."" Asked whether the pair are still British, Ms Rudd said she ""can't comment on individual cases"" but added: ""We will always make sure that we keep everyone safe"". However, a Whitehall source said: ""The day these barbaric terrorists turned their back on this country in pursuit of an evil agenda of bloodshed and slaughter, they forfeited forever their right to return. ""They are not British subjects and should pay the price for their crimes in Syria."" Sky News understands the Government's position on captured Islamic State fighters has still yet to be decided. Diane Foley, whose son James was beheaded in 2014, hopes Kotey and Elsheikh will be put on trial and sent to prison for life. She said sending them to Guantanamo Bay would be a huge mistake. David Haines' wife, Dragana Prodanovic, also called for the pair to face a fair trial. She told Sky News: ""There is no moral satisfaction. I hope they will go through a fair trial and get the sentence they deserve - a life in prison - and not in a hotel, not in a very nice prison with all the commodities, but solitary."" Kotey and Elsheikh are said to have been trying to escape to Turkey at the time they were picked up by US-backed Syrian forces. A spokesman for the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said a decision on whether the men would be tried in Syria or elsewhere would be made once their own investigation into the pair had concluded."

But in a ruling at Westminster Magistrates' Court, Senior District Judge Emma Arbuthnot said Assange believed he was ""above the normal rules of law"" and arresting him was a ""proportionate response"". ""Defendants on bail up and down the country, and requested persons facing extradition, come to court to face the consequences of their own choices,"" the judge said. ""He should have the courage to do the same."" She added: ""He appears to consider himself above the normal rules of law and wants justice only if it goes in his favour."" After the ruling, Assange said he ""surprised"" at the decision and claimed the judgment contained ""factual errors"". Statement on ruling: We are surprised. Judge went well outside what the parties presented in court. This seems to have led to many factual errors in the judgment. US DoJ confirmed to Reuters again yesterday that its case is ongoing. There are 3 months to appeal judge's decision. It was Assange's second failed attempt to have the arrest warrant dropped in a week. Last week the same judge rejected his lawyers' claim that the warrant issued in 2012 was no longer valid because an investigation into rape claims had been dropped by Swedish authorities. Assange has been living inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London for more than five years, fearing extradition to the United States for questioning over the activities of WikiLeaks if he leaves. He has accused the UK government of a ""cover up"" to keep him detained and claimed his case had exposed ""improper conduct"" by the Crown Prosecution Service. His barrister Mark Summers QC has alleged that emails showed a CPS lawyer apparently persuading the Swedish prosecutor not to drop the case. He previously told the court that Assange had health problems, including depression, and that his years inside the embassy were more than adequate punishment for his bail offence. The 46-year-old sought asylum in the embassy because he feared Swedish police would eventually send him to the US over WikiLeaks' publication of thousands of secret military documents in 2010. The site released confidential information on the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, provoking fury among US intelligence and defence chiefs. Assange's lawyers believe there is a secret US indictment that will end up with him in an American court. The UK government has not confirmed whether an extradition request exists."

Christie, who was devastated after a triple disqualification at the Sochi Olympics four years ago, had been trying to force her way through to third place on the penultimate lap. But the 27-year-old appeared to catch Canadian Kim Boudin before dropping to the ground, ending her latest attempt at a first Olympic medal. Christie ended up fourth after Korea's Choi Minjeong was disqualified after the end of the race. It meant Boudin took bronze, the Netherlands' Yara van Kerkhof silver, and Italy's Arianna Fontana the gold. Fighting back tears, Christie told BBC Sport: ""I was knocked over, I didn't fall on my own. When there are five people in a final it doesn't give you any benefit when someone gets penalised. ""It is just tough. I have worked so hard for the 500m and it has been taken away from me. ""Even in the semi-final, I got crashed into then and ended up in lane four. I know it is short track and I am supposed to be prepared for this but it still hurts."" The British competitor had eased through the quarter final but was forced to rely on a photo-finish in the semi-final, where she came second. It meant she was placed in the difficult fourth lane for the final. However, all is not lost for Christie - she will have another chance of grabbing a medal in the 1,000m and 1,500m events later in the week."

Some of his victims broke down in tears when the verdicts were delivered, while Bennell stared at the floor as he appeared via prison video link due to ill health. The jury will resume their deliberations on seven remaining charges on Wednesday morning. Bennell, who scouted for Manchester City and coached at Crewe Alexandra, denied a total 48 sexual offences against 11 schoolboy footballers between 1979 and 1991. The 64-year-old was described by prosecutors as a ""child molester on an industrial scale"" who would not just groom his victims, but also their families. Victims who had been coached by Bennell as boys told how he had a ""power hold"" over them as they dreamed of becoming professional footballers. He was said to have been treated like ""God"" at Manchester City's former ground, Maine Road. Bennell was compared to the Child Catcher from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang as he invited boys to his house where he had arcade games, a pool table, videos and exotic pets including a puma and a monkey. One victim, who he had admitted abusing in 1998, said he knew of four men who had been coached by Bennell, including former Wales manager Gary Speed, who had gone on to take their own lives. The jury was told there was no evidence to link the deaths to Bennell. Bennell, who had previously received three jail sentences for abusing boys, declined to give evidence in his own defence in the trial. The court heard transcripts of police interviews in which he admitted having a ""grooming process"" and being attracted to teenage boys. But he denied the latest allegations and said his accusers were ""jumping on the bandwagon"" following publicity. His barrister, Eleanor Laws QC, described him as being a ""sitting target"" after being convicted of child sexual abuse in the 1990s and in 2015. ""The defendant is a known target and he coached these boys,"" Ms Laws said. ""They know when making allegations, whether truthful or not, that they are making allegations against a convicted paedophile."" Jurors were directed to return not guilty verdicts on three indecent assault counts. They will resume their deliberations on the remaining seven charges at 10.15am on Wednesday."

Some 25% said they were fairly untrustworthy, 44% that they were fairly trustworthy, and 9% that they were very trustworthy. Allegations emerged last week that Oxfam staff had used prostitutes in Haiti in 2010. International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt has said Oxfam risks losing Government funding worth £32m if it does not account for the way it handled accusations of misbehaviour.

But new research produced by Dr Neil Vargesson from the Institute of Medical Sciences in Aberdeen University is at odds with a recent Government-commissioned report, published three months ago, which suggested there was not enough scientific evidence to demonstrate a causal association between the drug and malformations. Dr Vargesson's study, first seen by Sky News last year in its early stages, was published on Tuesday in The Scientific Reports. It shows that when the drug is applied to zebra fish embryos they suffer a range of deformities, including shortened tails, spine, fin and eye defects. Fish are often used to screen drugs as their embryos can replicate the reaction of humans. For example, Thalidomide shortens the fins in fish as it does the limbs in humans. Dr Vargesson also found the drug caused greater damage the earlier in development the embryo is exposed to it, and that higher doses can be lethal. He told Sky News: ""With the paper we show that you get damage to tissue in areas all across to body - the fins, the ears the eyes, the spinal cord. ""We show that it is in a dose dependent manner and a time dependent manner. If you add low doses you don't get any effect but high doses can be lethal and there are doses in between that can cause damage, but the embryos survive."" He added: ""Obviously with a hormone pregnancy test women are going to be taking this at different time points - so the earlier they took it there would be more damage. ""What this study says is there is a potential chance that a Primodos-type mixture could cause some problems, so more work is needed to make a final definitive conclusion. ""These poor people have been waiting 40 or 50 years to know the answer and we don't know the answer but I don't think anyone can put their hand on their heart right now and say it did not do this."" The Government's Commission On Human Medicines (CHM), set up by the Medicines and Healthcare productsRegulatory Agency (MHRA), had seen the preliminary findings of Dr Vargesson's study. In their report, published in November 2017, they did not respond to the findings as they had not been peer-reviewed or published. The CHM report frequently mentions that the studies available on Primodos were conducted decades ago and used outdated methodology. They were therefore criticised by alleged victims for not giving more weight to Dr Vargesson's work, or waiting for it to be published. Dr June Raine, MHRA's director of vigilance and risk management of medicines, said: ""The Expert Working Group (EWG) of the Commission on Human Medicines conducted a comprehensive independent scientific review of all available evidence including this then-unpublished scientific study and their overall conclusion was that the available scientific evidence, taking all aspects into consideration, did not support a causal association between the use of Hormone Pregnancy Tests such as Primodos during early pregnancy and birth defects or miscarriage. ""The EWG made a number of future-facing recommendations and our focus is now on implementing these. ""While the review cannot take away from the very real suffering experienced by the families involved, it helps shape the path to further strengthen the scientific evidence which supports safety monitoring of medicines in pregnancy."" The manufacturer Schering, now owned by Bayer, has always denied that Primodos could be damaging. A spokesperson for Bayer said: ""Dr Vargesson concludes that his research data demonstrate that the active substances of Primodos are 'potentially teratogenic' (an agent that could disturb embryo development) in the zebrafish and that his findings are worthy of further research in mammalian species. ""In particular, he does not conclude that his data show that Primodos is teratogenic in humans. He rightly notes that it is 'difficult and dangerous to directly compare drug action(s) between species', a point emphasised by the EWG as well."" Marie Lyon, chair of the association for Children Damaged by Hormone Pregnancy tests, said: ""The results of Neil Vargesson's research have finally exposed the dangers of the components of Primodos. ""His research will call into question the conclusions and recommendations of the EWG Report published last year. We will continue in our battle to expose the truth about HPT's and owe a huge debt of gratitude to Neil."""

Thomas Cook said its flight and holiday programme will begin with three weekly flights to Enfidha from Manchester, London Gatwick and Birmingham. This will expand to include Glasgow from April and Newcastle and London Stansted from May. It comes after the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) eased its travel advice last summer for the capital Tunis and major tourist resorts in the North African country. But it continues to caution against ""all travel"" and ""all but essential travel"" to some areas of the country, including those closer to the Libyan border, warning that ""terrorists are still very likely to try to carry out attacks in Tunisia"". Thomas Cook resumed holiday sales to UK customers in August 2017, with managing director Chris Mottershead saying: ""Tunisia has been a popular destination for decades and with our first three flights sold out, there is an appetite from our customers"". It did not stop selling holidays to French, German and Belgian tourists after the Sousse attack as their governments did not advise their citizens against travelling to Tunisia. In 2014, some 440,000 people from the UK visited Tunisia, according to the Office for National Statistics. Demand also went up the year before the Sousse attack. The Islamic State terror group said it was behind Rezgui's massacre."

Designed to be used on any platform, it can support the detection of terrorist propaganda across a range of video-streaming and download sites in real-time. It is made so that it can be integrated into the upload process, so that the majority of video propaganda is stopped before it ever reaches the internet. The Government claims the new tool detected 94% of IS propaganda with 99.995% accuracy. Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who is in the US to discuss online security with major tech companies, said: Over the last year we have been engaging with internet companies to make sure that their platforms are not being abused by terrorists and their supporters. ""I have been impressed with their work so far following the launch of the Global Internet Forum to Counter-Terrorism, although there is still more to do, and I hope this new technology the Home Office has helped develop can support others to go further and faster. The purpose of these videos is to incite violence in our communities, recruit people to their cause, and attempt to spread fear in our society. ""We know that automatic technology like this, can heavily disrupt the terrorists' actions, as well as prevent people from ever being exposed to these horrific images. ""This Government has been taking the lead worldwide in making sure that vile terrorist content is stamped out."" Home Office analysis shows that IS supporters used more than 400 unique online platforms to publish material in 2017. It also revealed that 145 new platforms from July until the end of the year had not been used before."

Thirteen months after the power-sharing government collapsed, there were hopes the DUP and Sinn Fein could be close to resolving their differences over an Irish Language Act. But 24 hours after the Prime Minister's engagement with the two largest parties, the gap between them appeared to be widening. Mrs Foster said: ""When Prime Ministers fly in, there's always a sense that things are moving in a particular direction and we have made good progress. ""But people did jump to certain conclusions. There was talk about a free-standing Irish Language Act…but we won't be agreeing to an Irish Language Act…we've always said that was a step too far.""

""The DUP need to make up their mind up whether they are up for a deal or not,"" Mr Murphy added. Mrs Foster, whose party has been propping up the minority Tory government at Westminster since last summer, played down talk of a breakthrough coming soon. ""Whether it is this week, whether it is in a couple of weeks or whether it is in a couple of months, what I must ensure is that we have an accommodation that everybody feels content with,"" she said."

Ms Patel told Sky News on Wednesday, however, that the resignation earlier this week of Oxfam's deputy director Penny Lawrence was not enough and that Mr Goldring should also stand down.

He once said he felt ""pushed aside, degraded and humiliated"" and that his self-respect had been ""destroyed"". In 2016, despite remaining married and officially still living with his wife, he renounced the title of prince consort and spent his days at a chateau on a vineyard in southwestern France. In August last year, Prince Henrik announced he did not want to be buried next to his wife, breaking a 459-year-old tradition. The palace said he had dementia following his announcement. Like most monarchies, a princess in Denmark becomes queen if her husband ascends to the throne but a man does not become king by being married to a queen. Prince Henrik briefly won support in the Danish parliament as part of a movement which eventually came to nothing, following a referendum in 2009 that backed sexual equality in royal successions. He said at the time: ""I hope that men will be as equal as girls."" In accordance with the prince's wishes, his body will instead be cremated, with half of the ashes scattered in Danish waters and the other half buried in the gardens of Fredensborg Castle, near Copenhagen, where he died. His death comes after he was diagnosed with a benign tumour two weeks ago. He was soon moved from hospital to the castle, where he wanted to spend his final moments. Prince Henrik, who was also known for his love of wine and food, wrote poetry, made sculptures and wrote cookery books. He also gained a niche following among young people in Denmark for breaking with Danish norms and remained divisive because of his aristocratic manner. He leaves behind his wife, whom he married in 1967, and their two sons, Crown Prince Frederik and Prince Joachim. Prince Henrik's funeral is due to take place on 20 February."

That was less than the £5.14bn they are paying in total under the current deal for 168 matches, and reduces the average cost per match from £10.2m to £9.3m. Sky's rise took it above the price that 21st Century Fox has agreed to pay in its £18.5bn takeover bid of the remainder of the company it does not already own. That prompted some speculation that Fox might have to pay more for the deal - which it expects to complete by the summer but remains subject to a final decision by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). Under the latest deal, Sky Sports will show 128 matches a season, two more than under the current deal, but is paying £199m a season less to do so. BT will show 32 games a season, down from 42, and it is also paying less than last time - though its cost per game has risen by about a fifth. A further two broadcasting ""packages"", covering 40 games a season in total, remain on the table and have attracted interest from ""multiple bidders"", according to the Premier League. That leaves open the possibility of the likes of Amazon or Facebook becoming involved, after speculation ahead of the TV rights announcement that a bid might come from a tech giant. Simon Leaf, sports lawyer at Mishcon de Reya, said that despite the potential concern of the Premier League that the amount paid had fallen, the result was ""by no means a terrible situation"". He said: ""If a major tech giant, such as Facebook, is successful in winning even one of the two remaining packages, a three-way fight for all of the packages next time around is likely to lead to a resumption in the extraordinary growth seen in previous years. ""There's also the international sale of these rights to be finalised over the next year or so, which will likely more than make up for any domestic shortfall."" George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said securing more games at a lower cost looked like a ""major coup"" for Sky. He added: ""There's always the chance the remaining two packages spring a surprise, but with reserve prices not yet reached, it's safe to say Amazon, Netflix and other potential new entrants aren't prepared to adopt the aggressive strategy Sky execs must have feared. ""All this means Sky looks much healthier than when Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox first bid for the business. ""In early trading the shares touched £10.95, 20p ahead of the price Fox has agreed to pay. This tells us Murdoch might need to come back with an improved offer."""

Now scientists from the University of Sheffield says switching from polypropylene to polyurethane may lead to fewer side effects. Polyurethane, is softer and more elastic than polypropylene and is said to be closer to human tissue. The research also has found that a female hormone can be added to the polyurethane which stimulates tissue growth and speeds up the healing process. Professor Sheila MacNeil, of Sheffield University's Materials Science and Engineering department, said: ""For many years now, surgeons have been treating the problems of urinary stress incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse using the only synthetic material they had to hand - polypropylene. ""In certain procedures… it is beneficial to the patient and carries relatively little risk. ""However, when much bigger areas of the same material are inserted… the complication rate is frankly unacceptable. ""We have focused our efforts on polyurethane (and) we have shown through our research that it does not provoke inflammation and retains its strength and elasticity. ""The addition of oestrogen is a major breakthrough as we have proved its beneficial effects in regenerating pelvic tissue."" Pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence affects half of all postmenopausal women worldwide. Pelvic organ prolapse affects a fifth of UK women but often only becomes apparent after a women who has had children goes through the menopause. Last month, the Government announced it was launching a full retrospective audit of all women who have had the surgery since 2005 in order to find out the scale of the complications. The official complication rate for vaginal mesh surgery is from 1-3% but recent studies have shown it to be anything between 10% and 15%. But one mesh complications victim said she was deeply sceptical about the new product. Belinda Birkett, from Wilmslow, who was diagnosed with fibromyalgia after she had a mesh implant, told Sky News: ""It's… outrageous. It's made mostly from glue, nail varnish and also paint. ""It's just another quick fix idea when plastics should never be put in a man or woman’s body ever."""
2018-02-14,A new drug has been found to relieve some of the worst symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180214201247/https://news.sky.com/story/alzheimers-drug-reduces-psychosis-symptoms-without-side-effects-11249735,"Pimavanserin is an antipsychotic which alleviates symptoms such as paranoia or delusions and works by blocking a very specific nerve receptor in the brain. Crucially it does not produce the side effects associated with similar drugs which sedate patients and can increase the speed of deterioration in brain function. Their use leads to 1,660 unnecessary strokes and 1,800 unnecessary deaths in the UK every year. :: 'Brain pacemaker' hope for Alzheimer's sufferers Reseachers at the University of Exeter Medical School tested pimavanserin in a placebo-controlled trial of 180 patients with Alzheimer's disease psychosis to study its efficacy and safety. Ninety of them were given pimavanserin and 90 of them a placebo. Professor Clive Ballard, who led the research, said: ""Psychosis is a particularly terrifying symptom of Alzheimer's disease. ""People may experience paranoia, or see, hear or smell things that are not there. It's distressing both for those experiencing the delusions and for their carers. ""It's particularly encouraging that most benefit was seen in those with the most severe psychotic symptom, as this group is most likely to be prescribed antipsychotics. ""We are talking about vulnerable elderly, frail people who are suffering terrifying symptoms, being sedated with current antipsychotics even though its well known that they cause terrible health issues and even death in people with dementia and have very little benefit. Pimavanserin's ability to reduce psychotic symptoms in dementia is now being assessed in a larger-scale clinical trial in the US. As many as 22 million people worldwide who are living with Alzheimer's disease will experience psychotic episodes."

MPs later revealed the man was homeless. It is has been claimed that ""many"" MPs had previously spoken to the man and assisted him. Sky News understands someone who works in Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's office was also in contact with the man and brought him food. Posting on Twitter, Mr Corbyn wrote: ""I've just been told about the death of a rough sleeper right by the entrance to Parliament. ""The powerful can't carry on walking by on the other side while people don't have a home to call their own. ""It's time all MPs took up this moral challenge and properly housed everyone."" Labour MP Neil Coyle, co-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Ending Homelessness, claimed the death was an ""appalling indictment of Government failure"". ""When a homeless man dies on the Government's doorstep, ministers must stop ignoring the problem and commit to end rough sleeping,"" he added. His party colleague Emma Lewell-Buck revealed that - if the identity of the man was as she thought - then she and ""many other MPs have spoken to him and helped him out where we could"". Tory MP Heather Wheeler, the Government's minister for homelessness, said the ""dreadful news"" of a suspected rough sleeper dying at Westminster Tube station will ""push me on to find solutions and to work to eradicate rough sleeping for good"". A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: ""No one should ever have to sleep rough. ""That's why this Government is committed to halving rough sleeping by 2022 and eliminating it altogether by 2027."" The Government has pledged to spend more than £1bn until 2020 to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping. Metropolitan Police said a man was pronounced dead at the scene at 7.33am on Wednesday in the underpass of exit 3 at the station. A spokesperson added: ""At this early stage in the investigation, the death is being treated as unexplained but not suspicious."" A spokesman for the London Ambulance Service said: ""We were called at 7.16am today to Westminster Tube station, to reports of a man not breathing. ""We sent a team leader, an advanced paramedic, a cycle responder and two ambulance crews. ""Sadly, despite resuscitation efforts, he died at the scene.""

2018-02-14,A man has been found guilty of murdering his niece and the attempted murder of another woman.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180214201247/https://news.sky.com/story/builder-mujahid-arshid-found-guilty-of-murdering-niece-celine-dookhran-11250431,"Mujahid Arshid, 33, was also convicted of the rape and kidnap of 20-year-old niece Celine Dookhran, and the rape and kidnap of the other woman. And he was found guilty of sexually assaulting the surviving victim when she was 13. His co-defendant Vincent Tappu was acquitted of all charges against him, which included the kidnap of both women, false imprisonment and possession of a firearm with intent. The Old Bailey heard throughout the course of the trial that Arshid had kidnapped the two women while wearing pyjamas and a balaclava. He was said to have become ""sexually fixated"" with his niece, who worked in a Barclays bank. In July last year, Arshid took the two women to a house between Kingston and Wimbledon in south west London, which he was helping to renovate. They were bound and gagged, and when they arrived, they had their throats slit and were raped. The surviving woman managed to text her boyfriend and mother, warning them she had been kidnapped. She told her mother: ""He's going to kill me. Don't reply."" Prosecutors told the court Arshid was acting out sexual fantasies during the kidnap. The second woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, escaped when she convinced her attacker that they could be together. She told the court: ""He said: 'Now you've got 10 minutes to live and your body will shut down.' I was trying to play dead. ""He molested Celine's body while she was dead and then he molested me thinking I was dead. He's such a psycho. ""I sat up and he said: 'How have you got so much energy?' I was covered in blood from head to toe. I was swimming in it. ""I started saying things he wanted to hear - 'I love you, we can run away together, we can be happy together, we can have a family'. ""He said: 'I'm not good enough for you, look what I have done.'"" The woman managed to raise the alarm and was rescued by Arshid's brother, who saw her in the back of his truck and took her to St George's Hospital in Tooting, where she went on to have two operations as she recovered from knife wounds. In her hospital bed, she told police officers they would find Ms Dookhran's body in the chest freezer. Arshid had bought the freezer to place in the house, so the bodies would not be found until after he had fled the country. ""He brought Celine down in a bag, picked her up and put her into the chest freezer,"" she said. ""All I could see was her legs sticking out. I had to act like it was not affecting me."" When Arshid's wife demanded to know where their niece was on WhatsApp, Arshid initially told her: ""How do I know. She's the one that ran off."" She replied: ""You would stoop that low. You're the p***y."" Arshid then said: ""Whatever I may be, you made me. I'll call you from Pakistan."" But when his wife told him not to and that he was ""dead to me"", he retorted: ""So is Celine apparently."" Arshid was arrested at a Holiday Inn in Folkestone. When he was formally charged by police, Arshid told them to ""look at the evidence and keep an open mind"". He told police the surviving woman had killed Ms Dookhran in a fit of rage after he had consensual sex with both of them. He claimed she was injured when she attacked him but they struggled over the knife. His account was at odds with an examination of Ms Dookhran's body, as she was found with a sock stuffed in her mouth, and a knife wound that her cut through her throat and tape on her head. Ms Dookhran and the survivor had the same injuries, and could not have been inflicted during a struggle. The jury deliberated for 14 hours before delivering the guilty verdicts. Ms Dookhran's family shouted ""yes"" when the verdict was returned. Speaking after the verdict, the family of the survivor said the crime was not an honour killing. They added: ""Mujahid Arshid tried to destroy the life of the surviving victim ever since she met him, he has manipulated and lied repeatedly, and continued this throughout the trial. ""Mujahid Arshid persistently fabricated the truth and attempted to deceive the courts and the same can be said of those that have supported him during the course of this trial. ""More so, Arshid, by pleading not guilty, ensured that the surviving victim would have to relive that horrific day in minuscule detail during the course of this trial. He showed not an ounce of remorse throughout this trial, in spite of the hurt and pain he purposefully caused."""

Thames Valley Police believe the driver and two passengers who fled the scene were all male. Investigating officer James Mather said: ""I am appealing to anyone who may have information about the incident to please contact police immediately. ""I would particularly like to speak to anyone who has mobile phone or dashcam footage of the incident or the vehicle being driven in the town to come forward.

2018-02-14,"Sir Winston Churchill, in the wake of the First World War, remarked: ""The whole map of Europe has been changed… but as the deluge subsides and the waters fall short we see the dreary steeples of Fermanagh and Tyrone emerging once again.""",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180214201247/https://news.sky.com/story/why-does-boris-johnson-keep-on-ignoring-ireland-when-it-comes-to-brexit-11250388,"A reminder from history that the Irish border has repeatedly been a distraction; a thorn in the side of British politicians this past century. The current Foreign Secretary will, of course, be familiar with Churchill's words. He has written an entire biography on the wartime leader, but Boris Johnson seems determined to ignore the Irish border when it comes to Brexit. Why? It is clear to politicians across Ireland, most at Westminster - and indeed the bureaucrats, officials and leaders elsewhere in Europe - that the key to Britain's future trading relationship with the EU will be shaped by the 310-mile border. Much of Brexiteers' focus should be on Ireland. It almost scuppered phase one of Brexit negotiations and remains a priority for EU officials in phase two of the talks. It has been revealed Theresa May used a visit to Belfast on Monday to ask the Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar for ideas in shaping the UK's future customs arrangements with the EU. It remains the stated position of all sides to keep the Irish border open, free and frictionless. However, Mr Johnson - in his Valentine's Day speech on Brexit - failed to mention the Irish border once. He did the same last September, in a 4,000-word thesis on Brexit he wrote for the Daily Telegraph. Not one thought, solution or reference to the Irish border. Other vocal Brexiteers are also surprisingly mute on Ireland. MPs like Iain Duncan Smith were ridiculed in December for publicly demonstrating their distinct lack of understanding of politics in the country. The Irish border, whatever your views, remains the most difficult, complex and politically sensitive aspect of Brexit. Although only 310 miles long, the Irish border has more crossings than the EU's entire eastern flank. Yes, it genuinely does. Tens of thousands of people and goods cross it every day. Towns, communities and even houses sit on the border. Technological solutions have been proposed but not yet tested, while police in Northern Ireland have warned against physical customs checks as they could become targets. All this with a deep-rooted historical suspicion of London and Dublin from different sides of the political spectrum in Northern Ireland. Mr Johnson and others can ignore Ireland and the border for as long as they want. But, as history has demonstrated, ignoring it doesn't last for long."

References veered from the Gettysburg Address to philosopher John Stewart Mill - and were peppered with short bursts of Latin. But the address from the Policy Exchange forum in London contained some less traditional quotes. Mr Johnson ended up comparing Prime Minister Theresa May to the prophet Moses, and made jokes about the Thai sex trade and ""dogging"". Sky News has rounded up eight of the oddest moments. Despite some of the quirky references in his speech, Mr Johnson raised the most eyebrows for refusing to rule out resigning later this year over the progress of Brexit. He was asked if he could quit the Cabinet, but dodged the question and only replied: ""We're all very lucky to serve and I'm certainly one of those."" It follows reports the Foreign Secretary could be preparing to dramatically leave Mrs May's top team if he sees a ""soft"" Brexit taking shape."

""Led by the BFI and BAFTA, the industry has come together to agree these principles and guidance,"" the Harry Potter star said in a promotional video published alongside the guidelines. ""Developed by people who understand the subtleties of the hierarchy on a film set and what it's like to work strange, unsociable hours. ""I hope these principles become second nature for everyone; they are not just about protecting individuals but are also an important step in embracing a greater diversity of voices - and eventually having an entertainment industry that actually represents the world we live in. :: BFI withdraws Harvey Weinstein's fellowship The 27-year-old actress joined the likes of Gemma Arterton and Doctor Who's Jodie Whittaker to support the initiative on Tuesday, in response to the sexual harassment scandal which took Hollywood by storm. New principles will be incorporated into the BFI's Diversity Standards and will from now on serve as the eligibility criteria to be nominated for a BAFTA film award. They include respecting others, adopting a zero-tolerance approach to bullying and harassment, adhering to the laws around equality and health and safety, protecting victims and witnesses, respecting confidentiality, ensuring that rigorous processes are in place for reporting and underlining inclusive values. ""These principles are important because up until recently there were no guidelines,"" Watson said. ""There was no protocol for someone that had been sexually harassed in the entertainment industry and I know this to be a fact because I've asked for principles, I've asked to see guidelines and no one could give them to me. ""No one could say to me: 'Okay, here's the protocol that we follow when someone's had this experience'. Which I found shocking."" Apart from affecting the film awards, the principles will also cover projects seeking BFI funding."

Although Amazon has said such ads are ""marked"" to prevent them from triggering responses from devices in homes, the complainant's device had gone ahead and placed the order. The owner was able to cancel it, but complained to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) that the advert was ""socially irresponsible"". However, Amazon has said that even if they had not cancelled the order themselves, it would not have been processed without the customer ""confirming"" the order. ""To shop with Alexa, customers must ask Alexa to order a product and then confirm the purchase with a 'yes' response to purchase via voice,"" said a spokesman for the retail giant. ""If you asked Alexa to order something on accident, simply say 'no' when asked to confirm."" Owners of any Alexa devices can also use the accompanying app to turn off voice purchasing or set up a code to authorise any orders. The ASA said it was satisfied Amazon had done enough to protect owners of the devices from any accidental shopping via its adverts. ""In this instance, the complainant had cancelled the order themselves, but we understood that had they not done so, the order would nonetheless have been cancelled automatically,"" it said. ""Therefore we understood that it would not be possible for a purchase to be made without the account owner's knowledge, even in instances where technology, intended to stop ads interacting with devices, had not been effective. ""We concluded that the ad was not socially irresponsible and did not breach the code."" Last month a US TV station was inundated with complaints after viewers' Echo devices overheard a presenter's comments about doll houses and started ordering them.

Yet, Mr Johnson also took the opportunity to send a message to Cabinet colleagues, ahead of their gathering at the Prime Minister's country retreat of Chequers this month. At the crunch meeting, Government ministers will decide on their strategy for the next phase of Brexit negotiations and formalise what form of future relationship they want Britain to have with the EU beyond March 2019. :: Analysis: Why does Johnson keep on ignoring Ireland? The Cabinet are said to be split between those such as Chancellor Philip Hammond, who want the UK to seek a close relationship with Brussels, and those such as Brexit cheerleader Mr Johnson, who favour the ability to move away from EU regulations.

It follows reports Mr Johnson could be preparing to dramatically quit Theresa May's top team if he sees a ""soft"" Brexit taking shape.

""But I don't think we should necessarily commit, as a matter of treaty, that forever and a day we are going to remain locked into permanent congruence with the EU. ""That doesn't seem to me a sensible thing to do. ""If you're going to come out you then you might as well take the advantages of difference."" Mr Johnson added it would be ""anti-democratic and very hard to justify"" if the EU was able to impose new regulations on the UK after Brexit ""when we're not round the table"" and ""in a way that we can't contest"". In a wide-ranging address, trailed as being a message to Remain supporters, the Foreign Secretary insisted ""we will continue to be Europeans both practically and psychologically"". He said: ""Brexit is about re-engaging this country with its global identity, and all the energy that can flow from that. ""And I absolutely refuse to accept the suggestion that it is some un-British spasm of bad manners. It's not some great V-sign from the cliffs of Dover. ""It is the expression of a legitimate and natural desire for self-government of the people, by the people, for the people."" In a swipe at former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, Mr Johnson added Brexit ""is surely not some reactionary Faragiste concept"". Mr Johnson claimed ""EU regulation is not always suited to the economic needs of the UK"", claiming rules made in Brussels are about trying to ""create an overarching European state"". The Foreign Secretary, who spearheaded the Vote Leave campaign, also repeated his promises that more money can be spent on the NHS after Brexit, while the Government will be able to cut VAT on some products. However, he warned Brexit is not ""some economic panacea any more than it is right to treat it as an economic pandemic"". ""The success of Brexit will depend on what we make of it,"" he added. ""And a success is what we will make of it - together. And that very success will be the best thing for the whole of continental Europe."" Mr Johnson called for ""confidence and national self-belief"" as he brought up the example of a constituent thinking of leaving the UK due to Brexit, telling her: ""Don't go to Canada or anywhere else"". European Commission president Jean Claude-Juncker branded Mr Johnson's claims Brussels officials are attempting to build an EU state as ""total nonsense"". ""Some in the British political society are against the truth, pretending that I am a stupid, stubborn federalist, that I am in favour of a European superstate,"" he told a press conference. ""I am strictly against a European superstate. We are not the United States of America, we are the European Union, which is a rich body because we have these 27, or 28, nations. ]""The EU cannot be built against the European nations, so this is total nonsense."" Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer hit out at Mr Johnson's ""empty rhetoric"", commenting: ""His insistence on deregulating our economy is the opposite of what businesses and trade unions want to hear. ""Instead of building the consensus we need, the Government's approach will only further divide the country and put jobs, rights and living standards at risk."" Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesperson Tom Brake insisted the ""completely deluded"" speech was about the Foreign Secretary's ""ambitions to become the next prime minister"". ""The lack of detail and understanding shown in this back of a fag packet speech would be astounding, if we didn't already know that the Government has no clue and no plan,"" he said. Mr Johnson also came under fire from Tory colleagues, with pro-Remain MP Sarah Wollaston accusing him of ""humiliating and belittling"" his constituent. She wrote on Twitter: ""Now we urgently need a serious speech that addresses the reality of the practical issues, timescales & contingency planning including Irish border."" Fellow Remain-supporting Conservative Anna Soubry claimed Mr Johnson ""fails to understand the very real concerns of British business"". Mr Johnson's address is part of a series of upcoming speeches by top Cabinet ministers, including Theresa May, titled ""The Road to Brexit""."

""According to the curators of the wax museum in Niagara Falls, this is Beyonce,"" wrote journalist Ama Scriver, who kickstarted the online backlash by posting a photo of the sculpture. According to the curators of the wax museum in Niagara Falls, this is Beyoncé. 🧐🧐🧐 pic.twitter.com/jrhd1J1qlI The post prompted fans to share photos of other attempts to capture the magnetism of one of the world's biggest popstars on wax. It turns out the outcome has never been pleasant. From plain whitewashing to comparisons to US reality TV star Farrah Abraham, five other statues have made fans shiver. Theory: Beyoncé wax figure makers have never seen Beyoncé pic.twitter.com/KpjWugXBrI One user shared the theory that ""Beyonce wax figure makers have never seen Beyonce"", while another pointed out one figure reminded her of ""celebrity barbies from the 90s"". ""These wax sculptor people keep making Beyonce white,"" wrote another angry fan. ""For real I am obsessed with how bad this wax museum is. It is the rudest tourist attraction,"" said another.

The nominee for the inspiring teachers' prize, who works in one of the UK's poorest and diverse areas, managed to stand out among the 30,000 entries from 173 countries. Among her many interventions to improve school life has been learning basic greetings in many of the 35 languages spoken among the pupils. Languages include Gujarati, Hindi, Tamil and Portuguese. Ms Zafirakou said it was about making parents feel welcome and included and said it ""helps to break down barriers and enables families to engage more in the school community"". She added: ""If you have somebody who can connect with you and appreciate your background, then that's special."" The star teacher also helped to set up clubs and societies for pupils and redesigned the curriculum with fellow teachers to make it more relevant to her pupils' lives. Ms Zafirakou has become well-known for getting to know pupils and understanding their lives - including visiting their homes, taking the bus with them and welcoming them at the school gates. She said: ""By getting pupils to open up about their home lives, I discovered that many of my students come from crowded homes where multiple families share a single property. ""In fact, it's often so crowded and noisy I've had students tell me they have to do their homework in the bathroom, just to grab a few moments alone so they can concentrate. ""I also found that some were being forced to play truant to cook meals in the allocated time slot they were permitted to use their shared home kitchen."" She said some children were not able to participate in extracurricular activities as they had to take on ""parental responsibilities"" such as collecting siblings from other schools. ""Discovering all this prompted me to organise additional provision within the school day and often at weekends to help students have the opportunity to progress,"" Ms Zafirakou said. ""This included giving them access to a quiet place to do their art work, as well as time to participate in extracurricular activities."" Gates paid tribute to all the finalists and said that a great teacher could be ""the most important factor"" in whether or not a young person receives a good education. ""When you think about what drives progress and improvement in the world, education is like a master switch - one that opens up all sorts of opportunities for individuals and societies,"" he said."

The Worcestershire coroner Geraint Williams recorded a conclusion of suicide in the death of Bethany Shipsey but added that a series of failings in her care in a busy A&E department amounted to failures in basic medical care. Miss Shipsey was admitted to A&E in Worcester in February 2017 following an overdose of DNP diet pills but the coroner could not conclude she would have survived if she had received the full package of care. After the conclusion, her parents said they were ""very disappointed"". In a statement read outside the court, they said: ""We do not feel that the coroner's conclusion reflected the evidence that was heard during the inquest."" They added: ""Bethany's basic human right to life was breached in the very place you would expect it to be preserved."" The overdose was Miss Shipsey's 15th, and she was also a mental health outpatient following an abusive previous relationship. Her mother Carole Shipsey, who is a trained nurse, told Sky News how they counted 27 patients being treated on trolleys in corridors that night. She said: ""There was no communication with us, there was no respect or dignity. ""Bethany literally went in on a trolley that night and she died on a trolley.""

Experts disagreed during the inquest as to whether better treatment could have saved Miss Shipsey but medical staff conceded their department was classed as ""overwhelmed"" that night. Senior nurse Kirsty South broke down in tears during her evidence as she described ""one of the most challenging shifts we have ever worked....it would be wrong for me to say that it doesn't occur regularly"". Miss Shipsey's father Doug told Sky News that the hospital had since admitted to him that there was a ""system failure"".

""We are sorry for the shortcomings in Bethany's care and the support which was offered to her family. ""We can reassure people using our urgent care services that we have taken actions since February last year that address the issues highlighted by the coroner today.""

He said he should have been recognised sooner, telling Sky News on the red carpet in London: ""If you're going to give one brother one, you should give the other one, so I was a bit put out with that, you know what I mean? ""But then again, best things come to those who wait, I guess."" Had his brother been in touch to congratulate him? ""Nah nah no, I don't speak to that clown,"" Gallagher said. ""He's too busy writing cosmic pop and sharpening his scissors, and trying to convince the Americans that it's the way forward."" The scissor reference follows Noel's recent use of a scissor player on stage at his High Flying Birds concerts. NME's editor-in-chief, Mike Williams, presented the award to the Wall Of Glass singer, saying: ""This is a man who understands exactly what it means to be a rock 'n' roll star."" But Gallagher said he doesn't want to be one of a dying breed. ""I hope not, I'm just one of many. But there's not many here tonight, I don't think."" He explained why he thinks there are not as many stars subscribing to the rockstar status that he holds. ""You're not allowed to say anything anymore, are you? If you say anything you get a slapped wrist and that, y'know what I mean?"" ""Apparently guitar music ain't that trendy anymore so they've all jumped ship, and they've got keyboards round them, it's their fault for jumping ship because it's always been cool and I think it'll come back round.""So the ones who'll come back and put their guitars back on - shame on them, y'know what I mean - whoever they are.""

The tips also suggest using fountain pens, keeping a set of cutlery in the car and using toothbrushes made from bamboo. It recommends streaming films, TV programmes and music online as opposed to buying DVDs and CDs, and suggests using bars of soap instead of liquid hand wash. The church also warns of the dangers of raiding your hotel mini bar as it can be ""not only incredibly expensive but they all come in plastic packages or bottles"". The calendar instruction reads: ""For Anglicans Lent is the time when we remember the 40 days that Jesus spent in the wilderness, facing challenge and temptation. ""It is a time when we reflect on God's purpose for our life. This year we challenge you to give up single-use plastics – to reduce the actions which damage God's creation."" Church of England environmental policy officer Ruth Knight said environmental issues tied into the Christian ""calling"". She said: ""The Lent challenge is about raising our awareness of how much we rely on single-use plastics and challenging ourselves to see where we can reduce that use. ""It ties in closely with our calling as Christians to care for God's creation."" The guidance comes after dozens of senior Tory MPs - including Environment Secretary Michael Gove - vowed to cut down on their plastic use for Lent. Business Secretary Greg Clark and 11 other ministers said they would stop using water bottles, plastic cutlery and disposable coffee cups in an effort to boost their green credentials. The action for Lent - which started on Wednesday and finishes on 29 March - comes as a Sky News investigation found thousands of tons of plastic scrap collected for recycling from British households were transported and dumped at sites across the world."

His seven-year-old daughter lost a large part of her skull in the attack, leaving her paralysed and needing a wheelchair for the rest of her life. The man, who claimed he had no recollection of the crash near Penistone, South Yorkshire, in August, was sentenced at Sheffield Crown court on Thursday after admitting four counts of attempted murder and dangerous driving. He has been ordered to serve a minimum of 14 years before he can apply to be released. At the hearing, judge Mrs Justice O'Farrell heard how in the weeks before the incident Scott had developed paranoia, attributed to temporary psychosis caused by his long-term recreational cocaine and cannabis use. The court also heard how he had been a loving father to the seven-year-old, 21-month-old, nine-month-old and eight-year-old stepdaughter even after he broke up with his ex-partner. Scott picked up the children from his ex-partner's home in Southampton and went on a two-day trip around the country before the crash 230 miles from the childrens' home. Simon Keeley QC, prosecuting, said the man, from Fawley in Hampshire, first went to the Isle of White before heading for Liverpool. He had also purchased a satnav in Lancashire and visited a Burger King in Bury before the crash in South Yorkshire. The court heard how a police sergeant who saw the crash said Scott left the vehicle uninjured and clambered over the seriously injured children. The two girls were found on top of each other on the central console of the car and the younger children were found in footwells. The judge outlined the horrific injuries sustained by the children, including multiple blows to the head consistent with a hammer found in the vehicle. A shunt has been fitted to the seven-year-old, which will be used to drain fluid from her head for the rest of her life. The 21-month-old has a hole in his skull, which requires further surgery. Both boys must now wear protective helmets, the court heard. Michelle Colborne QC, defending, said Scott had become convinced a Southampton-based gang wanted to harm him and the children, which led him to try to kill the children in an attempt save them from a worse fate. While sentencing Scott, the judge told him: ""You, their father, on whom they were entitled to rely for love, affection and comfort and, in particular, on whom they did rely to keep them safe, inflicted shocking injuries that will have long-term limiting implications for them. ""You will have to live for the rest of your life knowing that you have damaged, in some cases irrecoverably, the health, both physically and psychologically, of your children."""

He said he received a call from FBI agents after Cruz's arrest, but the agency has not confirmed this. The FBI has not confirmed the account was linked to Cruz. :: He was ""troubled"" Chad Williams, an 18-year-old at the high school, remembered Cruz as a troubled classmate from middle school. He said Cruz would set off the fire alarm, day after day, and finally got expelled in the eighth grade. :: His adoptive mother died in November Cruz and his biological brother Zachary were adopted by Lynda Cruz and her husband when they moved from Long Island to Broward County. His adoptive father, Roger, died of a heart attack several years ago. His mother died of pneumonia in November last year, aged 68. He went to live with a family friend, but was unhappy there and moved in with a friend and his family in northwest Broward. They knew he had a gun, and made him keep it in a locked cupboard. He was able to keep the key. The family he was staying with have not been named. They are said to be ""devastated"" by what happened. :: ""He was crazy about guns"" Chad saw Cruz carrying several publications about guns when they met by chance at the high school recently. He thought Cruz was there to pick up a younger brother or sister. ""He was crazy about guns... he was kind of an outcast. He didn't have many friends. He would do anything crazy for a laugh, but he was trouble. ""I think everyone had in their minds if anybody was going to do it, it was going to be him,"" Victoria Olvera said. :: He was banned from bringing his backpack into school ""There were problems with him last year threatening students, and I guess he was asked to leave campus,"" Maths teacher Jim Gard told the Miami Herald. :: He was part of the US military-sponsored Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corp Jillian Davis, 19, says Cruz was part of the programme as a high school freshman. Davis is a graduate and former fellow JROTC member. ::He belonged to a white nationalist group The leader of a group called Clearwater Republic of Florida said Cruz belonged to one of their cells and took part in some of their militia's activities involving the use of weapons. The group wants Florida to become its own white ethno-state. Jordan Jereb said Cruz acted ""solely on his own behalf"". :: He was calm during his arrest Cruz was taken into custody without a fight about an hour after the shooting. Michael Nembhard was sitting in his garage on a cul-de-sac when he saw a young man in a burgundy shirt walking down the street. In an instant, a police cruiser pulled up, and officers jumped out with guns drawn. ""All I heard was 'Get on the ground! Get on the ground!'"" Nembhard said. He said Cruz did as he was told."

It comes after the latest round of negotiations between the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn Fein, aimed at restoring Northern Ireland's executive at Stormont, failed to reach a deal. DUP leader Arlene Foster claimed on Wednesday there is ""no current prospect"" of discussions with Sinn Fein leading to the re-establishment of Northern Ireland's government. The DUP, who prop up the minority Conservative government at Westminster, have also called the Prime Minister's visit to Belfast on Monday as a ""distraction"" during power-sharing talks. Mrs Foster has insisted it is now ""incumbent"" on Westminster to begin direct rule in the continued absence of a devolved administration. The Northern Ireland Assembly was dissolved more than a year ago after an initial row between the parties over an energy scheme. Although Ms Villiers agreed MPs in London will need to set a budget for Northern Ireland, she urged both the DUP and Sinn Fein to carry on talking. She told Sky News: ""I hope that the immediate next move is that the leaders of the DUP and Sinn Fein will keep talking to one another, to the Northern Ireland Secretary and that attempts to reach an accommodation will carry on. ""But also it looks inevitable that there will need to be Westminster legislation to set a budget and sort out various other key issues because time has run out. ""We need a budget for the Northern Ireland authorities and, obviously, at the moment I'm afraid we're not going to get it through a re-establishment of the devolved executive."" Mrs Foster blamed a dispute over Irish language legislation for Wednesday's breakdown in negotiations, with Sinn Fein wanting standalone laws to protect speakers. But the DUP will only consider legislation that also incorporates other cultures, such as Ulster Scots. Sinn Fein's leader in Northern Ireland, Michelle O'Neill, claimed her party had ""stretched"" themselves and had ""reached an accommodation with the leadership of the DUP"" before they collapsed the talks. Ms Villiers claimed ""there is a way to deliver"" a solution that suits both sides, adding: ""I don't think the parties are a million miles away from delivering that legislation that Sinn Fein really wants. ""But it has to be in a form that is seen to be fair to the different culture and traditions in Northern Ireland."" The Tory former minister also defended Theresa May amid criticism of the PM's direct involvement in talks earlier this week. It has been suggested the DUP even advised Mrs May not to visit Belfast on Monday, ahead of her trip. But Ms Villiers insisted the success of failure of negotiations ""ultimately depends on Northern Ireland's leaders and in particular its two largest parties, the DUP and Sinn Fein"". ""A succession of Prime Ministers have worked hard to deliver agreements but there's only so much they can do, ultimately it is down to Northern Ireland's leaders,"" she added. ""I'm sure the Prime Minister's visit will have been helpful but this is a very, very difficult set of circumstances and this is a very sensitive issue."" Sinn Fein is now expected to outline the party's next move after the collapse of talks. Karen Bradley, the UK Government's current Northern Ireland Secretary, said negotiations had made ""substantive progress"", but admitted ""it appears that this phase of talks is now at an end"". She added ""challenging decisions"" will now need to be taken in London."
2018-02-15,"Increasing the amount of ultra-processed food in a person's diet proportionately increases their risk of cancer, a large study has found.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180216023522/https://news.sky.com/story/eating-more-processed-food-boosts-cancer-risk-11250934,"An examination of the food intake and health of nearly 105,000 people found that for every 10% more factory-processed food someone consumes, there is a 12% greater risk of them developing the disease. Fizzy drinks, packaged breads and cakes, crisps, sweets, sausages, bacon and ham, instant noodles, and frozen or chilled ready meals were found to be associated with the increased risk. The research by teams from the Sorbonne in Paris and the University of Sao Paulo also suggested there was an 11% increase in the risk of breast cancer. The study looked at 104,980 healthy French adults with an average age of 43 and asked them about their eating habits. After an average of five years, the adults were asked whether they had been diagnosed with cancer, and their answers were compared with their medical records. While eating more ultra-processed food was associated with an increased risk of cancer, there was no significant link between less processed foods - such as canned vegetables, cheese and fresh bread - and cancer. :: Eating burnt toast 'may increase cancer risk' Consuming fresh or minimally processed foods - such as fruits, vegetables, pulses, rice, pasta and fresh meat - was associated with a lower risk of cancer overall. The study's authors say: ""Several surveys ... have suggested that ultra-processed food products contribute to between 25% and 50% of total daily energy intake. ""This dietary trend may be concerning and deserves investigation. Several characteristics of ultra-processed foods may be involved in causing disease. ""In this large prospective study, a 10% increase in the proportion of ultra-processed foods in the diet was associated with a significant increase of greater than 10% in risks of overall and breast cancer. ""Further studies are also needed to better understand the relative effect of nutritional composition, food additives, contact materials, and neoformed contaminants in this relation."" The authors say ultra-processed foods often have a higher content of total fat, saturated fat, and added sugar and salt, along with a lower fibre and vitamin density. They are also more likely to contain additives and other compounds that are created by heat treatment, some of which may be carcinogenic. They say governments may need to take the findings into consideration when drawing up effective food and health policies to prevent cancer."
2018-02-15,Faulty fridges and tumble dryers are among the common household items causing more than 60 fires in UK homes every week.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180216023522/https://news.sky.com/story/eight-house-fires-a-week-caused-by-faulty-white-goods-11250607,"The inquiry into risks from faulty electrical items comes following the Grenfell Tower fire, which killed 71 people and is believed to have been started in a Hotpoint fridge-freezer. However, consumer group Which? said Government action was falling ""woefully short"", and challenged ministers to produce a plan within 90 days. Fire data showed that faulty washing machines and tumble dryers were the most high-risk appliances in the home, causing 35% of fires over a two-year period. Cookers and ovens, dishwashers then fridges, freezers and fridge-freezers were also listed as high-risk, all causing around 10% of fires in the same period. One of the ""immediate steps"" the consumer group want the Government to tackle are the estimated one million faulty Whirlpool tumble dryers still in UK homes. Fluff catching on a heating element in dryers has been blamed for 750 Whirlpool dryer fires since 2015, and a door mechanism fault is believed to have started a fire which killed two men in Wales in 2014. But despite knowledge of the defects, ministers have been accused of dragging their heels in modifying or replacing the faulty dryers. Which? called the UK's product safety regime ""antiquated"" and local government safety campaigner Simon Blackburn called for ""an easily accessible, comprehensive database of recalled products"". In January a new Government office was set up tasked with assessing product safety and standards. A Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesman said the Office for Product Safety and Standards ""will help better identify consumer risks and manage responses to large-scale product recalls and repairs."" Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee (BEIS) committee chairwoman Rachel Reeves welcomed the work being done, but said the office must have ""real teeth"" in order to achieve ""a reduction in the number of fires that blight so many homes and put lives at risk."""

London Ambulance Service confirmed that one of the men, who was in his 40s and worked as an engineer for British Airways (BA), went into cardiac arrest. Despite ""extensive efforts to resuscitate him"" at the scene and on the way to a west London hospital, he was later pronounced dead. A Heathrow spokesman said: ""We can confirm that following a serious accident involving two vehicles on our airfield, an airport colleague has passed away. ""Our deepest condolences go to the family and friends affected by this accident. We will be fully cooperating with the police in the investigation which will follow."" A BA spokesman added: ""We are deeply saddened by this tragic incident and are offering our full care and support to his family and colleagues."" The other man involved in the accident suffered a suspected broken shoulder and was also taken to hospital. Police said his injury was ""not life-threatening or life-changing"". The Health and Safety Executive were informed of the incident, but no arrests were made. Some passengers were forced to leave their planes as a result of the incident, with delays to a number of flights reported by people on the tarmac and at their gates. Most of the reported delays were departures from Terminal 5, with BA acknowledging disruption to ""a small number of our flights"". Heathrow had tweeted earlier that the collision was ""not expected to cause any impact on journeys today"". A spokesman for the airport added: ""The airfield remains open and we will work to minimise disruption to our passengers' journeys."""
2018-02-15,A man has been jailed for at least 40 years for murdering his niece and the attempted murder of another woman.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180216023522/https://news.sky.com/story/builder-mujahid-arshid-found-guilty-of-murdering-niece-celine-dookhran-11250431,"Mujahid Arshid, 33, was also convicted of the rape and kidnap of 20-year-old niece Celine Dookhran, and the rape and kidnap of the other woman. And he was found guilty of sexually assaulting the surviving victim when she was 13. His co-defendant, Vincent Tappu, was acquitted of all charges, which included the kidnap of both women, false imprisonment and possession of a firearm with intent. The Old Bailey heard throughout the course of the trial that Arshid had kidnapped the two women while wearing pyjamas and a balaclava. He was said to have become ""sexually fixated"" with his niece, who worked in a Barclays bank. In July last year, Arshid took the two women to a house between Kingston and Wimbledon in southwest London, which he was helping to renovate. They were bound and gagged, and when they arrived, they had their throats slit and were raped. The surviving woman managed to text her boyfriend and mother, warning them she had been kidnapped. She told her mother: ""He's going to kill me. Don't reply."" Prosecutors told the court Arshid was acting out sexual fantasies during the kidnap. The second woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, escaped when she convinced her attacker that they could be together. She told the court: ""He said: 'Now you've got 10 minutes to live and your body will shut down'. I was trying to play dead. ""He molested Celine's body while she was dead and then he molested me thinking I was dead. He's such a psycho. ""I sat up and he said: 'How have you got so much energy?' I was covered in blood from head to toe. I was swimming in it. ""I started saying things he wanted to hear - 'I love you, we can run away together, we can be happy together, we can have a family'. ""He said: 'I'm not good enough for you, look what I have done'."" The woman managed to raise the alarm and was rescued by Arshid's brother, who saw her in the back of his truck and took her to St George's Hospital in Tooting, where she went on to have two operations as she recovered from knife wounds. In her hospital bed, she told police officers they would find Ms Dookhran's body in the chest freezer. Arshid had bought the freezer to place in the house, so the bodies would not be found until after he had fled the country. ""He brought Celine down in a bag, picked her up and put her into the chest freezer,"" she said. ""All I could see was her legs sticking out. I had to act like it was not affecting me."" When Arshid's wife demanded to know where their niece was on WhatsApp, Arshid initially told her: ""How do I know. She's the one that ran off."" She replied: ""You would stoop that low. You're the p***y."" Arshid then said: ""Whatever I may be, you made me. I'll call you from Pakistan."" But when his wife told him not to and that he was ""dead to me"", he retorted: ""So is Celine apparently."" Arshid was arrested at a Holiday Inn in Folkestone. When he was formally charged by police, Arshid told them to ""look at the evidence and keep an open mind"". He told police the surviving woman had killed Ms Dookhran in a fit of rage after he had consensual sex with both of them. He claimed she was injured when she attacked him but they struggled over the knife. His account was at odds with an examination of Ms Dookhran's body, as she was found with a sock stuffed in her mouth, and a knife wound that her cut through her throat and tape on her head. Ms Dookhran and the survivor had the same injuries, and could not have been inflicted during a struggle. The survivor told the court that she had regarded Ms Dookhran as being like a ""sister"", adding: ""Hearing the helpless screams and seeing the fear in Celine's eyes that day. ""The terrifying visions and muffling sounds will never go away. ""Hearing Celine being killed stops me from closing my eyes and going to sleep like a normal person."" The jury deliberated for 14 hours before delivering the guilty verdicts. Ms Dookhran's family shouted ""yes"" when the verdict was returned. Speaking after the verdict, the family of the survivor said the crime was not an honour killing. They added: ""Mujahid Arshid tried to destroy the life of the surviving victim ever since she met him. ""He has manipulated and lied repeatedly, and continued this throughout the trial. ""Mujahid Arshid persistently fabricated the truth and attempted to deceive the courts and the same can be said of those that have supported him during the course of this trial. ""More so, Arshid, by pleading not guilty, ensured that the surviving victim would have to relive that horrific day in minuscule detail during the course of this trial. He showed not an ounce of remorse throughout this trial, in spite of the hurt and pain he purposefully caused."""
2018-02-15,"Sir Winston Churchill, in the wake of the First World War, remarked: ""The whole map of Europe has been changed… but as the deluge subsides and the waters fall short we see the dreary steeples of Fermanagh and Tyrone emerging once again.""",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180216023522/https://news.sky.com/story/why-does-boris-johnson-keep-on-ignoring-ireland-when-it-comes-to-brexit-11250388,"A reminder from history that the Irish border has repeatedly been a distraction; a thorn in the side of British politicians this past century. The current Foreign Secretary will, of course, be familiar with Churchill's words. He has written an entire biography on the wartime leader, but Boris Johnson seems determined to ignore the Irish border when it comes to Brexit. Why? It is clear to politicians across Ireland, most at Westminster - and indeed the bureaucrats, officials and leaders elsewhere in Europe - that the key to Britain's future trading relationship with the EU will be shaped by the 310-mile border. Much of Brexiteers' focus should be on Ireland. It almost scuppered phase one of Brexit negotiations and remains a priority for EU officials in phase two of the talks. It has been revealed Theresa May used a visit to Belfast on Monday to ask the Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar for ideas in shaping the UK's future customs arrangements with the EU. It remains the stated position of all sides to keep the Irish border open, free and frictionless. However, Mr Johnson - in his Valentine's Day speech on Brexit - failed to mention the Irish border once. He did the same last September, in a 4,000-word thesis on Brexit he wrote for the Daily Telegraph. Not one thought, solution or reference to the Irish border. Other vocal Brexiteers are also surprisingly mute on Ireland. MPs like Iain Duncan Smith were ridiculed in December for publicly demonstrating their distinct lack of understanding of politics in the country. The Irish border, whatever your views, remains the most difficult, complex and politically sensitive aspect of Brexit. Although only 310 miles long, the Irish border has more crossings than the EU's entire eastern flank. Yes, it genuinely does. Tens of thousands of people and goods cross it every day. Towns, communities and even houses sit on the border. Technological solutions have been proposed but not yet tested, while police in Northern Ireland have warned against physical customs checks as they could become targets. All this with a deep-rooted historical suspicion of London and Dublin from different sides of the political spectrum in Northern Ireland. Mr Johnson and others can ignore Ireland and the border for as long as they want. But, as history has demonstrated, ignoring it doesn't last for long."

It followed a crisis at Britain's biggest steel producer in 2016, when Tata put its entire UK operations up for sale amid a deteriorating industry environment. The company's British employees voted to accept proposals to close the existing pension scheme to new contributions, in exchange for greater certainty about the future of its 8,500-strong workforce. Members were given the option of moving to two other pension schemes - the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) or a new final salary scheme, BSPS2, both offering less generous payouts. Those who had not reached pension age had a third option of switching to a defined contribution scheme, known as a DB transfer. But the report by the Work and Pensions Select Committee criticised the Pensions Regulator and Financial Conduct Authority, accusing ""all those bodies with a duty to watch and act"" of failing to ensure ""members were not left in the dark"". It said ""faced with making a life-changing choice in a hurry"", many were attracted to the third option which meant giving up generous and stable benefits in favour of a riskier investment. The report said the circumstances surrounding the restructuring of the scheme created the ""perfect conditions for vultures to take advantage"". ""Many BSPS members were shamelessly bamboozled by advisers into signing up to ongoing adviser fees and unsuitable funds, characterised by high investment risk, high management charges and punitive exit fees."" It warned: ""Another major mis-selling scandal is already erupting and we therefore call on the relevant bodies to treat this as such and take urgent action."" Since March last year the scheme has processed 2,600 pension transfers equating to a total value of £1.1bn. The average value of BSPS pension benefits transferred out was £400,000. In around 20 cases the transfer value exceeded £1m. Labour MP Frank Field, chairman of the committee, said: ""Once again we find the Pensions Regulator fiddling while Rome burns, when it should have seen this rip-off coming. ""All the responsible authorities must act, now, to stop more people being cheated."" The committee recommended the Pensions Regulator conduct a review to learn lessons, and the FCA create an online register of advisers and their current status. A spokesman for the Pensions Regulator said it ""reviewed communications sent to members and were satisfied they adequately warned of the dangers of transferring out of a DB scheme"". ""And, while TPR does not regulate financial advice, we wrote jointly with the FCA and TPAS to members to flag potential risks,"" he added. An FCA spokeswoman said it had taken ""detailed, extensive and robust action"" on the BSPS to help steelworkers and it has been carrying out considerable work within its remit on DB transfer advice. She said the FCA is also reviewing rules applying to firms advising on pension transfers, adding: ""The FCA remains focused on ensuring consumers are protected."""
2018-02-15,"David Lean, who first met Barry Bennell in 1979, says he still harbours guilt that he may have been one of the first to be abused by a man who has now been convicted of a string of sex attacks.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180216023522/https://news.sky.com/story/barry-bennell-called-me-his-little-star-then-groomed-and-abused-me-11237797,"Here, he tells how he was first charmed and then attacked, and how he ended up living with years of shame before finally having the courage to tell police what happened: I first met Barry Bennell as a 12-year-old boy on a family holiday with my parents and brothers at Butlins in Pwllheli, northwest Wales, in May 1979. Bennell was the resident football coach and at first glance I was convinced I was about to be coached by Kevin Keegan. The coaching sessions were fantastic. He was a brilliant coach with a winning personality. Everyone loved him. The skills he could perform were way ahead of his time, including keeping the ball up in the air on just his shoulders and head. He instantly took a real shine to me and started to praise me at every opportunity, calling me a ""little star"" and telling me and my dad he had links to Manchester City, ran a feeder team for the club and that he wanted me to go and play games for his team during the forthcoming season. Butlins at the time ran a boy-of-the-week competition and although I did not win it on that occasion, in my mind I had won the biggest prize. I had exchanged addresses with my new hero and he wanted me to play for his team the next season. I was so desperate to win boy-of-the-week, I somehow managed to persuade my parents to take the family to Pwllheli for a second holiday in September that year. This time, the praise and attention were far greater, and I did win. I was on cloud nine. I won a huge trophy, got my first ever photograph in the paper and won a free holiday, too. Bennell had given me a couple of football shirts and had been writing to me for almost four months and, by this point, I worshipped him. Due to my own football commitments in Lytham St Annes - playing for my local team, my school and Blackpool school boys, as well as rep teams - I never ended up playing for his feeder team. In early 1980 he wrote to me, inviting me to go and take part in a soccer skills course in Macclesfield which was scheduled to take place on a Friday. The plan was to travel on Thursday evening to his property and stay until the Saturday morning, which would mean spending two evenings with him. I was buzzing. I could not get there fast enough and was really looking forward to it. Two nights at my hero's house, playing football - what more could I want? However, things soon changed. From the time I arrived, he never left me alone. He focused all his attention on me, play-fighting, touching me, massaging me and sort of cuddling up on the couch. When I got into bed that night, Bennell left the room and then re-entered and got into bed with me, without asking. After a long period of tickling and playing mirroring games he sexually abused me in bed for a prolonged period. The following day after football, I returned with him to his property and the abuse happened again. Each morning, following the abuse, he acted completely normal and was back to his passionate and enthusiastic self. I was all alone, lost, scared and confused, miles from home. Once back home, I began spending time on my own in my bedroom. I had no idea what had happened and due to the way my own body had reacted at the time of my abuse, I thought perhaps I was gay. I was embarrassed and kept it to myself for many years after. I knew I was never going back there and had just begun to feel safe again in that knowledge. However, just a few weeks later, I arrived home from school to find him sitting in my front room talking to my mum. He had never been to my house before. For many months afterwards, I was terrified to come home from school. For several years, I began knocking around with younger boys, as boys my own age started to get girlfriends and I was confused. I felt safer and less confused with younger boys as they were still obsessed with football and not so much into girls. I finally told Macclesfield Police what had happened to me on 4 February 2013, which was very hard. I then had a long battle with the CPS. They initially dropped my case as it was 'not in the public interest'. I told both the police and CPS at that time that there would be hundreds of victims of Bennell and asked them to open an investigation, but they still dropped my case. Following an appeal to the CPS child sexual abuse review panel, Bennell was finally charged. After a long wait for a court date, he was convicted in May 2015. He received a jail sentence of just two years, of which he would serve just one. On the back of my case, another survivor came forward and further charges were bought at the end of November 2016. It took 14 months from that survivor giving his statement to the police to Bennell finally being charged again. That survivor had gone to the police just four months after Bennell was convicted for sexually abusing me. I always knew there would be many more victims, and this started a process which has proved that it was always in the public interest to prosecute this prolific serial paedophile. It has been very difficult over the last five years for both myself, my family and of course my wife Teresa who, without doubt, has been not only my wife, but my best friend throughout all of this. I have received two periods of counselling over this five-year period, for which I am very grateful. This not only helped me to get through this difficult time, it has finally helped me to understand certain aspects of my abuse, which has allowed me to move on with my life. Believe me, it never, ever goes away. Watching live court updates recently proved this. I was almost physically sick viewing comments on Twitter about mirroring/copying etc. It was very hard to read, especially knowing that every single survivor suffered their own abuse after me, leaving me with a feeling of guilt that is very hard to live with. I regret daily not following up on a comment I made to my dad as I got in his car that Saturday morning in 1980. I told him Bennell had been ""trying to get in my bed but I wouldn't let him"". I don't recall making this comment, but it was the first thing my dad disclosed to the police during his interview. Despite not recalling it, I feel somewhat responsible for Bennell's continued abuse of young boys. If only I had said something. After battling cancer, my mum died on 20 January 2013, and I told the police what had happened to me just five days after her funeral. This, without doubt, opened many old wounds and over the past five years I have had some very dark and difficult days. Bennell was first jailed in the US in 1994 for assaulting a British boy on a football tour, and in 1998 was sentenced to nine years in jail in the UK for the sexual assault of six boys. I had made a secret promise to myself around that time that I would not make a disclosure while my mum was alive. She had said to me: ""I don't think I could cope if he had abused you."" How could I put my mum through that? I knew I had to protect her. However, I always wanted justice and I was never going to allow him to get away with sexually and psychologically abusing me. I will continue to raise awareness of childhood sexual abuse after this case has concluded. I have a truth to tell and I believe I can continue to help raise awareness. My determination to seek justice resulted in me winning my appeal, which changed the guidance in favour of prosecution. It effectively changed the law to support other survivors coming forward in future, and I feel very proud of this. On Friday 15 June this year, I am asking everyone to wear purple with my free and simple campaign #purplesummer. Collectively, we can raise awareness of all aspects of child abuse. It is inclusive to all, regardless of age, sex or religion, and is aimed at bringing us all together on one day to raise further awareness. We need to protect our children, both now and in the future. No child should ever be abused, and no abuser should go undetected. I knew it was always in the public interest - and now the world knows it too."

That compared with 77p spent on games, toys and hobbies, 57p on computer consoles and software and 54p on confectionery. The figures are likely to prompt concern about childhood obesity amid concerns that youngsters are consuming too many unhealthy snacks and soft drinks. More than half (56%) of children bought at least one soft drink in a typical fortnightly period and older children were more likely to do so. Meanwhile, 48% spent money on confectionery such as chocolate and sweets over two weeks. On average, children between seven and 15 spent £12.40 a week, with seven-year-olds typically spending £7.40 and fifteen-year-old spending £25. The biggest outlays were on clothes and shoes, followed by school dinners, and then soft drinks. The British Soft Drinks Association said manufacturers had voluntarily agreed in 2016 not to advertise any drinks high in sugar to under-16s across all media channels. Director general Gavin Partington said: ""As has been the case for a number of years, no and low calorie beverages account for the largest category in the UK soft drinks sector which is why sugar intake from soft drinks has reduced by almost 19% since 2013."" Last month, Public Health England said children should be limited to two snacks of no more than 100 calories per day. It warned that on average, children consume at least three unhealthy snacks and sugary drinks, with around a third having four or more - meaning children can easily have three times more sugar than is recommended."
2018-02-15,"The American government has issued a stark warning to all potential tourists to Mexico: ""Don't go"", after the country revealed nearly 30,000 people were murdered last year - the highest number in 20 years.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180216023522/https://news.sky.com/story/acapulco-the-resort-killed-by-drugs-guns-and-gangs-11250906,"The CIA says the violence levels are comparable with the war zones of Iraq and Syria. The resort city of Acapulco, a former playground of the rich and famous, is now at the centre of a crime wave that has swept across the country. Extortion, kidnapping and murder are daily events. I joined the Mexican Federal Police on patrol in what is now one of the most dangerous cities in the world. A police clear up operation of yet another murder scene quickly descends into a firefight as officers move into houses and make arrests. Its chaos. The heavily armed police units are firing in all directions, it is unclear if they are being attacked or not. Although as everyone is ducking down they are assuming they are. Like so many of these incidents it never reached a conclusion. It's just petered out. It is life on patrol. Mexico's crazy violence levels are simply out of control. With murder rates higher than at any point since the government started counting, it was clear before we set out that joining a police patrol would be unusual. In fact, outside of a war zone I have never seen anything like it. The police are in full combat gear and heavily armed. There are four trucks of them and in support an even better armed Marine unit in case things turn really nasty. We are in Acapulco, but outside of the main city it quickly becomes very rural. Out here the gangs are in charge, out here the rule of the gun not the law governs everything. We pull in to a village renowned for gang violence. There are reports there has been a new outbreak of violence since the last episode of blood letting. That last episode was the day before. By British standards what we were about to see would have been exceptional. In Mexico it is almost normal. The village leader walks me through a crime scene. On the floor of a modest single story storage building a small bunch of flowers and a lit candle have been placed on a large blood stain. Then I see another, and another and another. In this small space eight men, some just teenagers, were murdered in a gang execution. The village leader shows me how the men cowered before the gunman, but he killed them anyway. The families of the dead gathered outside. They are devastated but they aren't shocked. This is what it is like in Mexico today. Extreme violence used to settle minor incidents. It is a cycle that never seems to stop. A tearful mum wanted to talk to me. ""I want justice for the killing of my son,"" she told me as broke down and sobbed. ""He was a child, he was 17, he wasn't guilty of anything. He ran to protect himself and he was killed in that corner,"" she told me pointing to another bunch of flowers. In Mexico getting justice is difficult. In the first 48 hours of my arrival in Acapulco we saw the bodies and murder scenes of 19 people. There were many more - those are just the ones we can confirm. In the 60's 70's and 80's Acapulco was a place of glamour and a playground for the rich and famous. It is still beautiful of course. But it is tainted now. Beach bars are empty or closed, there are no foreign tourists and the army are deployed on the beaches to protect Mexican families still prepared to come here. For many years the crime gangs had an agreement not to kill in Acapulco. That agreement has gone; extortion, kidnapping and murder are daily occurrences. Half of all the businesses on the famous seafront are shaken down by gangs every single day. ""There are 50 gangs in this state, too many,"" Laura Caballero, a business woman who mothballed three businesses to avoid losing them to the gangs, told me. ""One gang comes and wants money, then another and then another. ""I remember Acapulco in the 70's, it was vibrant with tourists from around the world. Now they are gone, its very sad,"" she said. Bodies are left dumped on the beach front or even hanging from motorway bridges as a warning to other gangs. The Narco wars and the cartels are blamed for all of it. But in reality the violence is endemic through society. It is not just gang stuff. And there appears to be no way to stop it. :: Watch Stuart Ramsay's report on Mexico's drug trade as part of Hot Spots, on Thursday night on Sky Atlantic"

In a statement, Mr Tutu's office said: ""Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu has supported Oxfam International's good work for many years, most recently as one of its global ambassadors. ""The Archbishop is deeply disappointed by allegations of immorality and possible criminality involving humanitarian workers linked to the charity. ""He is also saddened by the impact of the allegations on the many thousands of good people who have supported Oxfam's righteous work."" Mr Tutu's office has written to the charity ""to inform them of his retirement as a global ambassador"", the statement added. Oxfam has been engulfed in a sex scandal after it was accused of concealing the findings of an inquiry into claims some of its staff used prostitutes in earthquake-hit Haiti in 2011. The charity's former director in Haiti, who has been placed at the centre of the scandal, has reportedly responded by hitting out at ""many lies and exaggerations"" but admitted he does not ""deny everything"". Roland van Hauwermeiren, who is said to have resigned before the end of Oxfam's investigation into the Haiti allegations, spoke out in an interview with local media in his native Belgium. Mr Tutu, a Nobel Peace Prize winner for his opposition to South Africa's brutal apartheid regime, is not the first Oxfam ambassador to quit over the scandal. Actress Minnie Driver resigned after saying she was ""horrified"" by the sex allegations, while film producer Livia Firth - the wife of actor Colin - said she was ""appalled"" by the scandal and no longer an active ambassador."

But there was no big mea culpa from Oxfam. Their immediate reaction was the story was ""old news"". No apology for the hideous betrayal of the people they exist to help. Or to the British people - who they've conned and let down. The wickedness of those sleazy aid workers has made good, decent people mistrust all charities and think twice about giving.

She announced in a statement on Wednesday: ""In our view, there is no current prospect of these discussions leading to an executive being formed. ""It is now incumbent upon Her Majesty's Government to set a budget and start making policy decisions about our schools, hospitals and infrastructure. ""Important decisions impacting on everyone in Northern Ireland have been sitting in limbo for too long. ""I had dearly hoped that we could have restored an executive and local ministers could have taken those decisions. That is not possible at this time."" Ms Foster added the DUP would not be ""held to ransom"" and that ""serious and significant gaps"" remain between both sides on the issue of an Irish Language Act. Michelle O'Neill, Sinn Fein's leader in Northern Ireland, responded in a statement that the party had worked to restore an executive ""on the basis of respect, integrity and equality"". She said: ""Sinn Fein engaged, we worked in good faith, we stretched ourselves. ""We had reached an accommodation with the leadership of the DUP. The DUP failed to close the deal. ""They have now collapsed this process. These issues are not going away."" She added that the DUP should ""reflect on their position"". The announcement will come as a major blow to the UK Government, after Theresa May and Irish premier Leo Varadkar visited Belfast on Monday to urge for a ""final push"" in talks. Ms Foster called the PM's trip a ""distraction"", with DUP chief negotiator Simon Hamilton doubling down on the snub, saying: ""I don't think it was entirely helpful towards us reaching a sensible conclusion."" Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson failed to mention Northern Ireland or the post-Brexit border issue once in a speech responding to people's concerns about leaving the EU hours earlier. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he ""regretted"" the breakdown in talks. ""I very much regret the statement from the DUP. ""Power sharing and working together are the only way forward for Northern Ireland,"" the Irish Prime Minister said. ""The Tanaiste and the Secretary of State are in close contact and we will continue to confer with the British Government about the next steps."" It is 13 months since Northern Ireland's devolved government collapsed. Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness resigned in January 2017 in protest at Ms Foster's refusal to stand down as First Minister over a botched renewable energy scheme."

2018-02-15,McDonald's is removing cheeseburgers from its Happy Meal menu in the United States to make its food for children more healthy.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180216023522/https://news.sky.com/story/mcdonalds-scraps-cheeseburgers-from-happy-meal-menu-in-new-health-drive-11251378,"Bottled water will replace chocolate milk on menus too to encourage children to select healthier drink options. Portions of fries will also be halved in six-piece chicken McNugget Mighty Meals for older children. The changes - which have already been implemented in the UK - form part of the global fast-food giant's plans to cut calories, sodium, saturated fat and added sugar from its products. It wants to have at least half of the Happy Meals listed on its drive-thru, restaurant and digital menus around the world to contain 600 calories or fewer by 2022. Diners will still be able to ask for cheeseburgers or chocolate milk with the kids' meal, but the company said banishing them from menus will reduce how often they are ordered. It said orders for fizzy drinks had fallen by 14% since they were removed from the Happy Meal menu four years ago. Future plans also include more healthy side options in addition to fruit and vegetables as an alternative to fries. Restaurants in Spain offer pineapple spears and cooked corn is on the menu in China, Japan and Taiwan. The firm, which in the past has been criticised for using toys to promote its Happy Meals, also wants to offer books as an all-year-round alternative in 100 of its markets around the world by the end of 2019 - up from 20. The changes are due to take effect in the United States by June. According to McDonald's UK online nutrition calculator, a cheeseburger Happy Meal with fries and a strawberry milkshake contains 738 calories. In comparison, a crispy chicken wrap, apple and grape fruit bag and an orange juice contains 397 calories, dropping further still to 289 calories if a bottle of water is the chosen beverage. Happy Meals in restaurants in the UK already meet the nutrition targets set out in Thursday's announcement, and do not advertise cheeseburgers and milkshakes, McDonald's UK said. A spokeswoman said: ""We take our responsibility to families very seriously and in the UK we have, for a long time, been committed to evolving our Happy Meal menu to keep in step with what parents want. ""We have pioneered an extensive salt and sugar reduction programme, and subsequently the average Happy Meal consumed in the UK last year contained 19.3% less salt, 9.4% less saturated fat, and 13.5% less sugar, compared with the average Happy Meal sold in 2006. ""Since 2007, we have offered book promotions whereby we swap out toys for books for around five weeks a year. ""We also give children access to books through WHSmith, Eason and Kobo whereby parents can use the vouchers printed on their child's Happy Meal box to purchase a book for £1 or download an eBook for free."" She added there were no plans to swap out toys for books all-year-round, but the company was working on launching a new lean-protein item to the Happy Meal later this year."

The gunman was eventually captured and 19-year-old student Nikolas Cruz has been arrested as the main suspect. Mr Trump has only commented on Twitter on the shooting, which started at around 3pm local time (8pm GMT). He wrote: ""My prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting. No child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school."" My prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting. No child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school. But Sarah sent an emotional reply back, calling for the US' latest mass killing to be the catalyst for action on gun control. She wrote: ""I don't want your condolences you f****** price [sic] of s***, my friends and teachers were shot. Multiple of my fellow classmates are dead. ""Do something instead of sending prayers. Prayers won't fix this. But Gun control will prevent it from happening again."" Her message garnered over 200,000 ""favourites"" on Twitter and sparked a fierce debate from other users about the state of America's gun control laws. Some of the reaction from both sides included: Details are still emerging about the shooting, but it is believed the gunman deliberately set off the fire alarm so youngsters would leave their classrooms as he arrived at the scene. Twelve people were shot dead in the school building, two outside, one in the street and two people were left with injuries from which they later died. Among those who tried to save students was football coach Aaron Feis, who died after apparently using his body as a shield against the bullets."

Dragomir, 34, was sentenced to seven years and six months after being found guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud, conspiracy to money launder, possession of fake ID documents and possession of equipment adapted for making fake ID documents. Cirstoiu, 37, the mastermind of the scam, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud, conspiracy to money launder and money laundering and was sentenced to six years behind bars on Friday.

The minister's statement follows the charity's response to demands outlined by Ms Mordaunt on Monday. ""I made three demands: that they make clear how they will handle any forthcoming allegations around safeguarding - historic or live; that they report staff members involved in this incident to their respective national governments; and that they fully co-operate with the Haitian authorities, including handing over all evidence they hold,"" she said.

""The actions and attitude of the organisation over the coming weeks will be critical.

""There was nothing I could do,"" he insisted. ""I was powerless. I did what I could."" He maintains he showed considerable leniency and took a number of risks by secretly defying his extremist chiefs. While in charge of prosecutions, he says he did his best to push for less severe punishments being handed down. He was in charge of preparing cases which would go before an imam who would act as judge and pronounce punishment. He spoke of one particular case where a boy of 14 was caught robbing a house. He was sentenced to arm amputation. When I asked if he could have done more to stop it or prevent it, he said it was impossible, that he felt guilty about it, but then went onto say: ""In international law, a guy under 18 is a child, but under our law, under Sharia law, when he is 14 he submits to Sharia laws and he is not a boy."" ""In a lot of the cases I had to prepare, I ignored them and forgave them. Once during a religious festival, I set free about twenty people. They were not big crimes. ""They were like robbery and other small crimes and 70% of the robberies were by children. The children used to go to the bombed buildings and try to collect copper and wire. I would just let them go free. ""But some people deserved their sentence. If someone is a killer, if someone raped a woman, they deserve it."" Speaking frankly, he continued: ""I didn't do harm to anyone. The people loved me. But for now, I have to disappear. A lot of people are angry with ISIS (another name for IS) and we are afraid of reactions. ""I ignored and helped a lot of people. It was better just to make it easier for people. But if the leaders of ISIS knew that I facilitated a limit of Allah without punishment, they may kill me."" He tells us that before the battle for Raqqa began in June last year, all the Princes (heads, emirs) and ministers were ordered to leave the city and be replaced by fighters - mostly foreign ones. He managed to smuggle himself out with his family in the crowds of civilian refugees who were fleeing Syria. He says he was helped by one of those he had spared from punishment. Are you afraid of receiving your own punishment now you are outside IS territory? I ask. ""No"", he replies. ""I'm just afraid of IS finding me. They have spies everywhere."" Abu Saqr also insisted the celebrations in Raqqa's main stadium in October as the Syrian Democratic Forces reclaimed the city and declared it free of IS were wildly premature. The world's eyes have been mainly focused on the battle against IS in Syria and Iraq, he said, but all the while, the terror group had long relocated to Libya. ""There was very few left in Raqqa by the end,"" he said. ""Only the foreign fighters were left behind. ""They had nowhere to go and were there to the death. Everyone else mostly left."" He politely refused to answer more specific, detailed questions about future IS plans, but ominously said: ""Libya is the ISIS gate to Europe. They have many cells there."" IS, it seems, has a new headquarters."

2018-02-16,Fans of Japanese champion Yuzuru Hanyu chose to celebrate the figure skater's Winter Olympics opener in a unique way - by showering him with Winnie the Pooh bears.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180217024830/https://news.sky.com/story/winter-olympics-fanatic-supporters-shower-japanese-figure-skater-yazuru-hanyu-with-winnie-the-pooh-bears-11253019,"The 23-year-old notched 111.68 points in the short program of the men's single skating on Friday, an Olympic record-breaking score that leaves him in first place ahead of free skating on Saturday. The impressive performance was met with a rapturous - and bizarre - response from the defending Olympic champion's faithful supporters, who showered him with dozens of Winnie the Pooh stuffed toys. It was not the first time Hanyu has been caught in a hail of teddy bears - the skater's fans do it as a nod to his love for AA Milne's classic character. Earlier this week, Hanyu told reporters we wasn't sure how the quirky tradition started. ""This happens every single time and makes me happy,"" he said. ""I am always very grateful. ""Mainly I think it's because I've always kept a box of tissues decorated with a stuffed Pooh at rinkside, and when I was really little I had a cap with Pooh on it. The fans just started doing it."" Due to corporate sponsorship rules, the Olympian was not allowed to keep his Pooh tissue box rinkside while he competed. However, that didn't stop his supporters bringing Pooh bears into the arena and sitting them on their laps as they watched. Others dressed as the honey-loving bear or wore Pooh hats. Supporters had not seen Hanyu skate since October following an injury, so they turned out in force at the Gangneung Ice Arena. Young assistants collected the bears from the rink after Hanyu's record-breaking performance and some had their arms so full the toys spilled out. The bears were heaped by the side of the rink, put into bags and will be donated locally."
2018-02-16,Toys R Us UK faces crashing into administration at the end of the month unless it can find new investors prepared to shoulder a £15m tax bill.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180217024830/https://news.sky.com/story/taxman-takes-ailing-toys-r-us-to-the-brink-with-15m-vat-demand-11252913,"Sky News has learnt that advisers to Britain's biggest standalone toy retailer are racing to secure a rescue deal for the business by the middle of next week, just days ahead of a 27 February deadline to meet a mammoth VAT demand. Sources said the company, which employs more than 3,000 people in the UK, would work through this weekend in an effort to progress talks with potential bidders. The Entertainer, a privately owned chain, and Alteri Investors, an acquirer of distressed retailers, are understood to have held talks in the last fortnight about buying parts of Toys R Us UK, although their ongoing interest was unclear on Friday. Hilco Capital, which salvaged the music and entertainment retailer HMV in 2013, is understood to have tabled a proposal that would involve taking on only a minority of Toys R Us' 105 British outlets. Hilco is likely to remain interested in a deal only if it is structured as a pre-pack administration, according to a source close to the process. Sky News revealed earlier this month that advisers to Toys R Us were racing to secure bids for the loss-making business - which only made it through Christmas after investors backed a major financial restructuring involving the closure of a quarter of its shops. The entire European operations of the ailing retailer are also on the market, encompassing 236 stores outside the UK in 10 countries including Austria, France, Germany and Spain. Toys R Us' UK and European businesses are being sold through separate processes being run by Lazard and Alvarez & Marsal. With only 11 days remaining before the £15m VAT bill is due, the prospect of Toys R Us UK avoiding insolvency proceedings look increasingly bleak. Such a move would cast grave doubt on the future of a brand which has had a presence in the UK since 1985 - along with about 3,200 workers. Poor Christmas trading has left the British business facing cashflow issues, with one insider saying earlier this month that it looked ""close to unsaveable"". Weak retail sales growth data published on Friday by the Office for National Statistics added to the sense of pessimism engulfing the high street. Toys R Us UK has already been planning to shed up to 800 jobs through a process called a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), which was approved by creditors just three days before Christmas. ‎The CVA is intended to provide breathing space for Toys R Us UK to improve its fortunes by closing 26 of its loss-making stores and securing big rent reductions at many others. Under that plan, which won the backing of 98% of creditors, including the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), its loss-making larger stores are due to begin closing in the spring.‎ The CVA deal secured the 11th-hour support of the PPF after the company agreed to pay almost £10m into its pension scheme over the next three years. Without a new owner being found, the Toys R Us UK pension scheme - which is tens of millions of pounds in deficit - will be absorbed by the PPF. Any such move is set to attract renewed attention from Frank Field, the Labour chairman of the Commons Work and Pensions Select Committee. Shortfalls in defined benefit pension schemes are facing intense scrutiny following the collapse of Carillion, the construction group which fell into liquidation with a Section 75 pension deficit of £2.6bn. Specialist toy retailers endured tough festive trading amid competition from Amazon and other online rivals, with Toys R Us now planning to close about 180 US shops - roughly 20% of the total - in the coming months. In the UK, retailers including BHS, Focus DIY and JJB Sports have previously used CVAs to exit loss-making stores, although all three companies ultimately succumbed to the fast-changing retail environment. New Look is now working on a similar plan, while House of Fraser is seeking rent reductions from landlords. The effort to overhaul its UK estate follows the filing by Toys R Us' American parent for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in September. There has since been controversy over payments to UK executives and the write-off of a big loan owed to the UK company. When the CVA was approved, Steve Knights, the managing director of the UK business,‎ hailed the ""strong support for our business plan... so that we can better serve our customers today and long into the future"". A source said the full list of European countries where Toys R Us' operations were on the market also included Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Poland and Portugal.‎ In the US, Toys R Us has won a court order to allow it to retain liquidators to close nearly 200 of its shops.‎ A spokesman for Toys R Us UK declined to comment."
2018-02-16,West Bromwich Albion football club has confirmed it is investigating an alleged stolen taxi incident that may have involved four senior players in Spain.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180217024830/https://news.sky.com/story/west-brom-players-probed-over-stolen-taxi-incident-in-spain-11253230,"The club is responding to reports that its players were questioned by police on suspicion of stealing a cab after a night out during a mid-winter training trip this week. According to a report in The Sun, the cab was driven through a McDonald's drive-thru before being abandoned outside of the five-star hotel where the players were staying. In a statement, the Premier League club said it has ""instigated its own investigation into the incident and the players will be subject to the full rigours of our internal disciplinary procedures"". ""Until such time as that investigation has been completed, the club will not be making any further comment."" The four players were questioned in a local police station over the incident, which happened before dawn on Thursday. They were staying at The One hotel for a three-day training trip in Barcelona ahead of an FA Cup fifth round tie at home to Southampton on Saturday. The regional police in Catalonia, the Mossos d'Esquadra police, have confirmed the incident. A source told The Sun: ""It appears the players had headed to the Barcelona Olympic Port but found everything closed so late on which is normal for midweek. ""They decided to take a taxi to a McDonald's drive-through nearby and somehow and for some reason, left there in the cab but without the cab driver. ""The receptionist at the hotel they were staying at phoned police when she saw the taxi had been left unattended outside."" West Brom are currently at the bottom of the Premier League table, five points behind Stoke in 19th, and seven away from escaping the relegation zone. The club's chairman, John Williams, and chief executive, Martin Goodman, were sacked this week because of the team's poor performances."
2018-02-16,"For several years now, Angela Merkel has been one of the most important women in British politics.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180217024830/https://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-and-angela-merkels-brexit-talks-could-see-conversation-dry-up-11252800,"When David Cameron was attempting to renegotiate the UK's relationship with the EU ahead of the Brexit referendum, his most intense lobbying efforts were focused on the German Chancellor. A meeting with Mrs Merkel was the first foreign trip made by Theresa May when she became Prime Minister in 2016. As the dominant power in the EU, it has long been understood by British prime ministers that little can change on the continent without Germany's backing. And if the UK wants a generous Brexit deal - that comes anywhere close to delivering a freedom to strike independent trade deals, while also maintaining near frictionless trade with European markets (not least across the Irish border) - a change in the EU's ""no cherry-picking"" approach to negotiations is precisely what Mrs May needs. So, it was a major blow to the UK's negotiating hopes when last year's German election results put Mrs Merkel's ability to form a new coalition government in question. Not because a new German leader would necessarily have had a different approach to Brexit - all the mainstream players held broadly similar positions on the matter - but because Mrs Merkel's focus would, for months, be turned towards domestic coalition-building as the clock ticked towards the UK's exit day. Although that German coalition has not yet been finalised, a deal has now been struck. And so Mrs May will be hoping to seize the moment and use her meeting with Mrs Merkel in Berlin on Friday to discuss the growing Brexit dilemmas. No doubt the Prime Minister will give the German Chancellor an insight into what she plans to say at the Munich Security Conference this weekend. Mrs May's speech is likely to focus on the defence and security partnerships the UK wants to maintain with the EU post-Brexit. No doubt, either, that the disagreements over the terms of the Brexit transition or implementation period will also be discussed between Mrs Merkel and the Prime Minister. Given the remaining 27 EU countries have mandated European Commission official Michel Barnier to represent them, as a bloc, in the Brexit talks, the German Chancellor is unlikely to make any unilateral pledges. But, if Mrs Merkel wanted to nudge Mr Barnier in a certain direction, few would argue she would be powerless to do so. On the biggest issue of all, however, conversation could dry up. Mrs May has not yet articulated what final relationship she seeks from Brexit. The speeches she gave at Lancaster House and in Florence last year, in effect, set out what the UK doesn't want, but did little to define the space in between. In a private briefing with German journalists a few weeks ago, Mrs Merkel is said to have mocked Mrs May - describing a circular conversation in which the UK Prime Minister asked the Chancellor to make her an offer, prompting Mrs Merkel to point out the onus was on Britain to ask for what it wants. Whatever Mrs May talks about in her discussions with the German Chancellor on Friday or in her speech on Saturday, it is unlikely she will answer that overriding Brexit end-state question. For all the warnings from the EU side that ""time is running out"", or the demands for ""concrete plans"" from Mrs Merkel's official spokesman, Mrs May is hamstrung by the fact that, 19 months on from the EU referendum, she and her Cabinet have yet to settle on their agreed position. The reason for that is because there's a real possibility they will not be able to do so. A Prime Minister in a stronger position could perhaps throw down the gauntlet, set out her chosen route and tell her ministers to back her or walk. But Mrs May's disastrous election performance last year means the Prime Minister now serves at their pleasure. If they walked, she could well be forced to walk as well. That suggests more fudging and postponement of the ultimate Brexit decision is likely. There is no doubt the German Chancellor has the power to help Mrs May unblock the Brexit negotiations if she chooses to. But, it is a case of ""help me to help you"". And, for now at least, it is not within Mrs May's power to help herself."
2018-02-16,Theresa May will tell world leaders and politicians at the annual global security conference in Munich that Britain will continue to contribute to the security of Europe but a new security treaty needs to be reached.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180217024830/https://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-to-call-for-new-security-treaty-with-eu-to-retain-cooperation-11253684,"Her speech on Saturday will highlight the successes that the UK and European security agencies have had in stopping terrorism and call for unity during a testing time as Britain leaves the EU. She will tell the EU that security is too important to let the traditional structures of the union get in the way. ""Europe's security is our security,"" she will tell the conference. ""And that is why I have said that the United Kingdom is unconditionally committed to maintaining it. ""The challenge for all of us today is finding the way to work together, through a deep and special partnership between the UK and the EU, to retain the co-operation that we have built and go further in meeting the evolving threats we face together."" ""I recognise there is no existing security agreement between the EU and a third country that captures the full depth and breadth of our existing relationship. ""But there is precedent for comprehensive, strategic relationships between the EU and third countries in other fields, such as trade. And there is no legal or operational reason why such an agreement could not be reached in the area of internal security."" Mrs May will cite the example of Operation Triage, where police in the UK worked with Europol and the Czech Republic to break a trafficking gang involved in labour exploitation. Separately, the chief of MI6 Alex Younger has met his French and German counterparts on the fringes of the conference. They spoke about the close daily cooperation between the agencies and insisted that cannot and will not change post-Brexit. The PM will also point out that the UK is one of the biggest contributors of data, intelligence and expertise to Europol and, through the Schengen Information System II, the UK is contributing to the sharing of real-time data on wanted criminals or suspected terrorists - issuing over 13,000 hits on people and objects of interest to law enforcement across Europe in the last year alone. The informal talk in the bars around the Munich conference is about Britain's retreat from the global stage and concerns about the effect of Brexit on Britain's foreign policy. Mrs May will directly address these fears. ""Those who threaten our security would like nothing more than to see us fractured,"" she is expected to say. ""They would like nothing more than to see us put debates about mechanisms and means ahead of doing what is most practical and effective in keeping our people safe. ""So let our message ring out loud and clear today: We will not let that happen. We will keep our people safe, now and in the years to come."""
2018-02-16,Jeremy Corbyn has denied claims by a former Cold War spook that he was allegedly paid by Communist secret police to spy on Britain.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180217024830/https://news.sky.com/story/jeremy-corbyn-denies-claims-he-was-paid-to-spy-on-britain-during-cold-war-11253891,"Jan Sarkocy, a former Czech spy, claimed he was the MP's handler during the 1980s for the country's communist secret service Statni Bezpecnost (StB), according to reports. He alleges he gave Mr Corbyn cash in return for information. A spokesman for Mr Corbyn, who has been the MP for Islington North since 1983, said Mr Sarkocy's story ""has more plot holes in it than a bad James Bond movie"". The former agent, whose spy name was Jan Dymic, said Mr Corbyn was named Agent Cob and met with him in the House of Commons, The Sun reported. Documents show Mr Corbyn met Mr Sarkocy in the House of Commons in 1986, at his constituency office in 1987 and in Parliament later that year, according to the newspaper. In the third meeting it is alleged Mr Corbyn warned the Czech about British operations against Soviet agents by handing him a newspaper cutting warning that MI5 was investigating suspected spies. However the spy dismissed the Labour Party's suggestion Mr Corbyn believed he was just a diplomat. ""Everybody knew that 'diplomat' was just a cover for spy,"" he told Czech media. ""It was a conscious co-operation. Diplomat and agent were the same thing. Corbyn was recruited. He also received money."" Mr Sarkocy, who was expelled from the UK by Margaret Thatcher and lives in Bratislava, said the information Mr Corbyn supplied was ""rated in Moscow as the number one"". He added: ""Mr Corbyn was an honest man, but stupid."" The former spy, 64, said the MP was told he could move to Russia if he got in trouble with the British authorities. But the Labour leader's spokesman insisted Mr Corbyn has never had any links with the Czech communist regime. He said: ""As Svetlana Ptacnikova, director of the Czech Security Forces Archive, has made clear, Jeremy was neither an agent, asset, informer nor collaborator with Czechoslovak intelligence. ""These claims are a ridiculous smear and entirely false. ""The former Czechoslovak agent Jan Sarkocy’s account of his meeting with Jeremy was false 30 years ago, is false now and has no credibility whatsoever. ""His story has more plot holes in it than a bad James Bond movie."" Ms Ptacnikova said: ""Mr Corbyn was neither registered [by the StB] as a collaborator, nor does this [his alleged collaboration] stem from archive documents."" She said the pair met for talks but he was not a spy. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said Mr Corbyn ""cannot be trusted"". ""Time and time again he has sided with those who want to destroy everything that is great about this country,"" he said. ""That he met foreign spies is a betrayal of this country. He cannot be trusted."""

Frybl, 36, attacked her at a cottage in Kultimantie, Finland, leaving her with 40 wounds, including 10 in her chest. A Finnish court heard how Frybl had been abusive towards 26-year-old Ms Johnson and had kicked her in the stomach the night before the fatal attack on 3 December, 2016. After stabbing his girlfriend, with whom he had moved to Finland from Scotland, Frybl fled the scene with some of his dogs before being arrested two and half miles away in woodland. When arrested, Mr Frybl, who served in the Czech army in Kosovo and Afghanistan, was found to have two stab wounds to his stomach, which prosecutors claim were self-inflicted. During the trial the court heard how some of Ms Johnson's wounds were inflicted when her back was turned or when she was trying to escape from their cabin. He claimed he had no memory of attacking his partner with a 4.5-inch knife, and said he must have been suffering a temporary breakdown. However a psychiatric report found he was not insane at the time of the incident. At an earlier hearing Frybl - who also uses the name Radek Kovac - admitted culpable homicide, having denied murder, but was convicted at a court in Lapland on Friday and sentenced to life in prison, along with a €40,000 (£35,000) fine. Under Finnish law, a murder conviction carries a mandatory life sentence - which in practice means at least 12 years. The court in Rovaniemi found there was no doubt the crime was committed in a ""particularly ferocious, brutal and violent manner"". Ms Johnson, from Burntisland, Fife, was a member of the Santa Safari team which organises Christmas-themed breaks to Lapland with Oxford-based tour operator Transun Travel."
2018-02-16,Serial paedophile Barry Bennell will be sentenced on Monday for 50 child sex offences.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180217024830/https://news.sky.com/story/barry-bennells-victims-convinced-clubs-new-about-the-abuse-11252425,"While some of his victims have now got justice, they also have many questions for the football clubs that should have protected them from him. Bennell was a scout for Manchester City in the 1980s and a youth coach at Crewe Alexandra, roles that gave him unfettered access to hundreds of schoolboy footballers who dreamed of careers in the professional game. This latest trial - his fourth conviction for child sex offences - heard evidence that he abused players at his home, on football trips to north Wales, Spain and the USA and even at Crewe's Gresty Road ground. Man City started an independent review of its links to Bennell when these latest allegations first surfaced in November 2016 and the club is urging anyone who was abused to come forward in complete confidence. Crewe Alexandra issued a statement upon his latest conviction denying they had ever had any knowledge of his offending and insisting that if they had they would have informed the authorities at the time. But one ex footballer who was abused by Bennell disputes this and has told Sky News that ""they knew, one million per cent"". Bennell left Crewe twice in the 1980s for ""football-related reasons"" and was even given a character reference afterwards which he used to secure a role as a youth football coach in Staffordshire. His victims have described him as ""god"" and as having had a ""power-hold"" over the young boys he coached. He followed court proceedings via a video link due to illness but will be brought to court on Monday for sentencing at Liverpool Crown Court. His victims are convinced that if the football authorities had been doing their job correctly in the first place back then he would have been stopped much, much sooner."

He denied intending to kill the woman, who is in her 20s, but admitted two counts of rape, causing grievous bodily harm with intent and stealing her handbag. However, jurors found the ""exceptionally dangerous"" defendant guilty of attempted murder after he left the victim ""hanging by a thread"". Pearce, of Clarendon Park, Leicester, was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 11 years at the Old Bailey in London. He was handed seven-and-a-half years' custody for the rapes to run concurrently alongside his life sentence, with no separate penalty for the remaining charges. Sentencing the teenager, Mr Justice Haddon-Cave said the defendant had carried out an attack of a sexual or sadistic nature and that he ""intended to silence the victim forever"". ""The defendant set out that evening to mark his 17th birthday to find a woman to attack and violently rape,"" he said. ""He can be seen on CCTV circling the park and hunting (the victim) down as she walked through the park. The attack itself was of animistic savagery. The offending was exceptionally serious."" Pearce dragged the victim into undergrowth before hitting her over the head, the court heard. Police had been alerted after the start of his attack was witnessed by others in the park. However, the court was told officers were unable to find anything because of a lack of a precise location being reported. A passing cyclist spotted a pool of blood and a hair clip on the ground about an hour later and went into bushes and comforted the victim until paramedics arrived. The follow day, police issued a CCTV image of Pearce running towards the victim holding the slab. His family recognised him and informed officers. The victim awoke from a coma in the following weeks with no recollection of what had happened. ""I do not remember screaming when I was assaulted, though I am aware that screams were reported to the police by various people that night,"" she said in an emotional statement. ""My screams did not stop my attacker from causing me further harm and nor did they help me be found so I could receive medical care I needed. ""Knowing that my screams did not change anything for me that night continues to trouble me."" Phillip Bradley QC, defending, said Pearce accepted he was ""entirely responsible"" for the violence."

He lived with his brother and their adoptive mother after the death of their adoptive father. The home was sold after the mother, Lynda Cruz, died in November. Although many of the calls do not include a written report as a follow-up, some mention he had expressed an interest in owning a gun, Buzzfeed reports. :: Florida school massacre gunman took just seven minutes to kill 17 people Cruz's lawyer, Melissa McNeill, told reporters on Thursday that he was ""sad"", ""mournful"" and ""remorseful"", adding that he was a ""broken human being"" who was aware of what was going on. The defence lawyer had her arm around the handcuffed 19-year-old during his first court hearing, where he was remanded in custody after being charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder. The teenager is accused of murdering 17 students and teachers at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, on the edge of the Everglades, on Wednesday afternoon. The FBI has admitted it was warned about him in 2017 and there are claims Cruz, who was orphaned after his mother died last year, was part of a white supremacist group. Police have said that after the shooting Cruz left his former school, from which he was expelled, and visited a Wal-Mart store before buying a drink from Subway then stopping at a McDonald's. The 19-year-old was arrested 40 minutes later by police officer Michael Leonard after he saw someone matching the suspect's description and stopped him as he walked along a pavement. Cruz confessed to carrying out one of the United States' deadliest school shootings, according to a sheriff's department report. :: Nikolas Cruz: What we know about 'troubled' Florida shooting suspect The statement from the Broward County Sheriff's Office said the teenager told officers he ""began shooting students that he saw in the hallways and on school grounds"".

Cruz set off the school's fire alarm to get all the students out and when they began to flee from his gunfire he discarded his AR-15 rifle and a vest so he could blend into the crowd, he told police. The teenager, who worked for discount retailer The Dollar Tree, is believed to have had paramilitary training in Tallahassee with white supremacist group Republic of Florida - with the group's leader saying he was a member. However, a police spokesman in Tallahassee said there were ""no known ties"" between the suspect and the group. :: US school shootings: A deadly history Its leader, Jordan Jereb, told the Daily Beast: ""I'm not trying to glorify it, but he was pretty efficient in what he did. ""He probably used that training to do what he did yesterday. Nobody I know told him to do that, he just freaked out."" He added that Cruz had ""trouble with a girl"" and believed the timing of the attack on Valentine's Day was not a coincidence. The FBI has begun an extensive review of how it handled an apparent tip-off about Cruz, an official said. YouTuber Ben Bennight said he told the FBI last year about a comment on the site under Cruz's name which read: ""I'm going to be a professional school shooter."" On Thursday night, more than 1,000 people held a vigil for the victims, and a spontaneous chant of ""no more guns"" broke out among the crowd. People dressed in the school's colour - red - while some held flowers and others raised signs asking for action to fight school violence, including gun control. Several said now was the time to talk about gun control, with one saying: ""Tomorrow is too late to say something, it was too late to say something yesterday. We need to act now."" :: President Trump is ignoring young Americans when it comes to gun control In a news conference at the White House, Donald Trump sent his condolences to the families and friends of all of those killed and thanked those who responded to the shooting. He raised the issue of mental health, urged students to go to teachers, parents or faith leaders to tell them when they think something is not right. He said his top priority was to make schools safer but avoided addressing the country's gun laws. Several victims had been publicly identified the day after the shooting, including star swimmer Nicholas Dworet, soccer player Alyssa Alhadeff, 14, basketball players Luke Hoyer, 15, and Joaquin Oliver, nicknamed Guac. Ambitious senior Meadow Pollack, 18, trombone player Alex Schachter, 14, Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps freshman Peter Wang, 15, and Jaime Guttenberg were also killed. :: Families and friends pay tribute to 'beloved' school massacre victims in Florida Assistant football coach and security monitor Aaron Feis, in his 30s, was killed while shielding students from bullets. Geography teacher Scott Beigel was killed as he tried to usher students back into his classroom and athletic director Chris Hixon was shot and killed."

It follows the failure of the most recent round of negotiations between the party and Sinn Fein to restore a devolved administration at Stormont, which has been absent for the last 13 months. Speaking on a visit to Belfast on Friday, Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley admitted it had been ""a difficult week"" but expressed her view an agreement between the parties could yet be reached. The Cabinet minister said she would consider ""all options"" over the weekend before making a statement to the House of Commons on Tuesday on the Government's next moves. ""This has been a difficult week, I am not going to make any pretence of that,"" she said. ""We have worked extraordinarily hard to do our very best to enable an executive to be formed and I still believe that can be done, with the will of the politicians to deliver what the people of Northern Ireland want and need: their elected politicians doing the right thing and delivering devolved government for the people of Northern Ireland."" Mrs Bradley added: ""I will do all I can to try and get devolved government back into Stormont because I genuinely believe that is the best thing for the people of Northern Ireland."" Sinn Fein have claimed a draft deal was struck with the DUP this week, before their negotiating partners pulled the plug on an agreement. But the DUP have dismissed those claims as ""propaganda"". The latest failure to restore Northern Ireland's power-sharing government centres on a dispute over Irish language legislation. The DUP have also branded Theresa May's visit to Belfast on Monday, when a deal was suggested to be close, as a ""distraction"" during the negotiations. However, Mrs Bradley defended the Prime Minister's trip to Northern Ireland, which - 48 hours later - was followed by the breakdown in talks. She said: ""The Prime Minister is the Prime Minister of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and it is absolutely right that she should come and visit Northern Ireland."" The Northern Ireland Secretary also appeared to suggest Mrs May's visit to the Bombardier aircraft factory in Belfast, prior to meeting politicians at Stormont, was the main reason for her trip. ""Quite rightly she came to visit a great business in Northern Ireland, a big employer, a business that we want to see thrive and grow and really dedicate itself to Northern Ireland, and that's what the Prime Minister was here to do,"" Mrs Bradley added. Earlier this week, former Northern Ireland secretary Theresa Villiers claimed it was now ""inevitable"" that Westminster will have to set a budget for Northern Ireland's authorities."
2018-02-16,"Wage growth failing to keep pace with house prices is being blamed for a ""collapse"" in home-ownership levels among young adults.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180217024830/https://news.sky.com/story/home-ownership-has-collapsed-among-middle-earners-ifs-11252571,"Those on middle incomes have been particularly affected, according to Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) data. People aged between 25 and 34 with after-tax incomes of between £22,200 and £30,000 had a one-in-four chance of being on the property ladder in 2015-16. That compares with two in three in the mid-1990s. It meant, the IFS said, that the home-ownership rate among middle-income young adults - at 27% - was now closer to those with low incomes than it was to those on high incomes. The economic research specialist said 8% of young adults on low incomes were home-owners now compared with 64% with high incomes. Senior research economist and author of the report, Andrew Hood, said of the shift: ""The reason for this is that house prices have risen around seven times faster in real terms than the incomes of young adults over the last two decades."" The finding tallies with an earlier warning from the IFS that wealth is likely to become more concentrated in older people as the young struggle to buy homes at a time when they are having to pay more towards pensions and bear the brunt of weak wage growth since the financial crisis. The report said average house prices were 152% higher in 2015-16 than they were 20 years earlier after adjusting for inflation, while real net family incomes for those aged 25-34 had increased by only 22% over the same period. House price growth has been mainly attributed to supply failing to match demand - with the construction industry warning that a lack of skilled labour is threatening building targets. A separate study by the Local Government Association on Friday found 423,500 homes across England and Wales were currently waiting to be built despite having been granted planning permission. The Government says it is currently working to identify how the building process can be speeded up. It has previously awarded financial support to help ease planning delays and said on Friday it was providing an £8.9m cash injection for projects in northern England to help kick-start the building of up to 2,241 new homes. The Government introduced the Help to Buy scheme in 2013 to bolster access to financial support for first-time buyers unable to pay large deposits, and scrapped stamp duty for almost all first-time buyers in November's Budget. Responding to the IFS study, housing minister Dominic Raab MP said: ""Through schemes like Help to Buy, we're helping more people onto the housing ladder and last year saw the highest number of first-time buyers in the UK since 2006. ""But we want to go further and faster and our ambitious plan backed by targeted investment will help even more people by delivering the homes Britain needs for young families, key workers and those on low and middle incomes."""

It said customers would also get access to more information on its 50,000 UK drivers - including the person's licensing authority and private hire number. The policy changes, Uber said, had already been implemented in London and it was currently in discussions with police forces elsewhere. The company was rocked last year when Transport for London (TfL) refused it a new operating licence on the grounds it was not a ""fit and proper operator"". The concerns outlined at the time included Uber's attitude to reporting serious crime, though it was able to continue operating in the capital pending the outcome of an appeal due in the spring. Uber has been hit by a string of scandals, including claims of poor working conditions, sexual harassment within the company, a massive data breach and theft of self-driving technology. Improving Uber's image has dominated the tenure of chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi who took over from founder Travis Kalanick in June last year Just last month, Uber said it would introduce a new cap on the number of hours worked by its drivers to bolster safety and tackle concerns over their rights. UK general manager Tom Elvidge said on Friday: ""With millions of trips across the UK booked through our app each week, the safety of riders and drivers using Uber is a top priority. ""Over the last few years we've led the way with pioneering technology which enhances safety like GPS tracking of every trip and our two-way rating system. ""But we recognise we can use our technology to go even further in setting a higher standard for private hire and other transport options. ""After listening to feedback from drivers, riders, local regulators and the police we're introducing a number of new features and changes to enhance driver and passenger safety."""

""I just froze, he had two young boys with him and he gave me this cheery 'hello' and in a split second I said hello back and that was that,"" Mr White tells me as we chat in Eccles, not far from where Bennell spotted him playing as an 11-year-old. ""I carry that with me every day. ""I had never told anyone what he had done to me in Majorca on that trip in 1979. I was becoming a well known footballer, I didn't want that in the papers, I didn't want my family knowing. ""It shook me just seeing him. And then he was gone."" Manchester City launched an independent review 15 months ago when Bennell's abuse hit the headlines and have offered ""heartfelt sympathy"" to his victims. A further 86 men have now contacted police to allege Bennell also abused them, but White fears the true figure is far higher. He said: ""One hundred? Two hundred? Five hundred? Who knows?

A post-mortem examination found she had been raped and beaten. On Friday, her family's lawyer Didier Seban said Michel Fourniret, who was jailed for life in 2008 for killing seven girls, was interviewed by magistrates in Paris and admitted murdering Ms Parrish along with French teenager Marie-Angele Domece. Ms Domece disappeared in 1988 and her body has never been found. Mr Seban said: ""He made detailed and repeated confessions. He clearly recognises, and this several times over, having killed Joanna Parrish and Marie-Angele Domece. ""It's a new development, a resolution of the affair, it seems, in a remarkable way... it's hard (for the family) but the end of a long legal battle."" He said he hoped Fourniret, who was dubbed the Ogre of the Ardennes over his previous killings, would now stand trial for Parrish's murder. Prosecutors in Paris would not comment on the apparent confession with an investigation now under way. A lawyer for Fourniret would not respond to a news agency request for comment. The serial killer had initially been charged with kidnapping and murdering Ms Parrish and Ms Domece in 2008 but the court of appeal dismissed the case in 2011. His wife Monique Olivier had twice accused him of being responsible for the killings but later retracted her claims. Mr Seban said she would have to be questioned again. Fourniret had always denied murdering Ms Parrish and Ms Domece, including during his 2008 trial at which he was found guilty of murdering the seven girls. Olivier was found guilty of being complicit in five murders and jailed for life. She has been ordered to serve at least 28 years in jail. In 2012, the court of appeal cancelled a dismissal order on Fourniret and asked for the investigation to resume in light of new leads in the case."
2018-02-16,The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has handed MPs the full version of its report into the treatment of customers placed in RBS' controversial Global Restructuring Group (GRG).,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180217024830/https://news.sky.com/story/city-watchdog-hands-full-report-on-rbs-turnaround-unit-to-mps-11253278,"The City watchdog had been given a deadline of Friday by the Treasury Select Committee to either publish the document or hand it over - having previously refused to place it in the public domain on legal grounds. Only a summary has been officially released so far as the FCA argued it had not obtained necessary consents to release the full version. It maintained that stance on Friday, insisting its hands were tied. The regulator also expressed regret that a leak had enabled the full report to be seen by some MPs and sections of the media last year. The document delves into allegations that RBS - still more than 70% taxpayer owned - mistreated many of the 12,000 small business customers placed in the GRG between 2007 and 2012. It included claims by some firms they were deliberately forced to fail to benefit the bank. The redacted version of the FCA report said 92% of potentially viable businesses that went into GRG had ""experienced some inappropriate actions"". RBS has admitted GRG did not do a good job as communication with companies - especially over fees - was poor, but it has insisted the bank did not deliberately push firms over the edge to pick up their assets on the cheap. Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the FCA, said in his letter to Treasury Committee chair Nicky Morgan: ""I do want to make it clear that it is not our intention to frustrate or impede the work of the committee, quite the reverse in fact, and with that in mind we are providing the report as required."" While he has previously pleaded the full report should not be placed in the pubic domain - at least not yet - the committee is to meet on Tuesday to decide its next move. Mrs Morgan said: ""At that meeting, I will be asking members to agree to publish the final, unredacted report under parliamentary privilege as soon as possible."""

They are the same design as the outfits that have helped British Cycling to dominate the last three summer Games. :: FundingSkeleton has received over £6m worth of funding from UK Sport in the last quarter, the most of all the winter sports.

2018-02-16,"After another mass shooting in a school, Americans are seeking to solve the problem of gun violence.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180217024830/https://news.sky.com/story/why-are-white-men-more-likely-to-carry-out-mass-shootings-11252808,"Nikolas Cruz has been charged with 17 counts of murder after a shooting at his old school, where he had been expelled for ""disciplinary reasons"". Fourteen more were wounded at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, in one of the worst mass shootings in modern American history. Cruz's name now joins a role call of mostly white men attached to the atrocities. Of 95 mass shootings carried out in the US between 1982 and 2017, 92 of the perpetrators were male. The final three are made up of two women, and one case of one man and a woman working together, in the San Bernardino attack in December 2015. The shootings broken down by race, by Statista, show that 54 of the gunmen were white, 16 black, and seven each Latino or Asian. :: Lawyer puts arm around 'sad' Florida gunman Nikolas Cruz in court Although there is frequent speculation about the mental health concerns of those who carry out the devastating acts, there is less conversation around whether the gender of the perpetrator is a larger issue. Professor David Wilson, a criminologist at Birmingham City University, said: ""Characteristics of USA school shooters? Male; used legally owned firearms - usually semi-automatic weapons; were ex students of the school they targeted."" He told Sky News: ""What is interesting is that the average gunman tends to be slightly older than we have here [in Florida]. ""If you look at the motivation that we know about it does seem to be that men handle their catastrophic loss and self esteem worse than women. ""When the husband or father loses their job or goes through a divorce separation they are thrown out of the home. :: Pictured: 17 victims gunned down in school massacre ""Their status is tied up in their occupation so they seem to suffer more psychologically, which seems to propel them in that way. ""Men also have unequal access to guns and training in using weapons like handguns and rifles. ""Three-quarters of mass murders will use firearms and so that unequal access to the training is relevant."" Professor Wilson added that men tend to have fewer support networks outside the family unit and their workplace, which can be problematic if one of those breaks down. He said: ""Men all over the world have these experiences, but they don't carry out mass murders. :: 'Dark forces are at work in the battle for US gun control' ""The reason is that we have different gun laws. ""In Florida, we have reports of the gunman's adoption and his depression, but that is an abstraction. ""It is not the lack of provision of mental health services in the US, but the availability of guns."" Some of the worst mass shootings in schools in recent years include the Sandy Hook massacre and the Isla Vista shooting. Elliot Rodger killed six people and injured 14 others before shooting himself dead inside his car on the Isla Vista campus in California in 2014. Adam Lanza, 20, stole his mother's guns after shooting and killing her at their home in Newtown, Connecticut on 14 December 2012. He drove her car to Sandy Hook Elementary School, where he went as a child. He killed 20 children, six adults and himself within 11 minutes. Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold attacked Columbine High School in Colorado on 20 April 1999. They murdered 12 students and one teacher and planted more than 100 explosive devices around the school. They exchanged fire with police officers at the scene before shooting and killing themselves. According to the Pew Research Centre, women who own a gun are more likely to have purchased it in later life, and more likely to say protection is the only reason they have it, not just one of the reasons for it. The centre's research also indicates that Republican and Republican-leaning women are more likely to support stricter gun laws, particularly around selling to those with mental health issues and the availability of assault weapons, compared to men with the same political leaning. :: US school shootings: A deadly history James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University, told CNN: ""Women tend to see violence as a last resort, as a self-defense mechanism. You use violence if you have to, if there's no other way out. ""Men tend to use violence as an offensive weapon, to show them who's boss."" He added that men were more likely to own guns, and be more comfortable around them. Mass shootings have followed a pattern in recent years when carried out by a man, which tends to focus around threats to their masculinity. There have been suggestions that Cruz was heartbroken after breaking up with a girlfriend, and had got into a fight with her new boyfriend. Stephen Paddock, who killed himself after opening fire from his hotel room over a concert in Las Vegas in October, did have a girlfriend, but was known as a ""loner"". She said he had grown distant in the final years of their relationship. Omar Mateen, who carried out the shooting inside an Orlando nightclub, had been described as ""mentally unstable"" by his ex-wife, who made claims of abuse during their marriage. The only recent shooting to involve a man and a woman was carried out in San Bernardino in December 2015, when husband and wife Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik opening fire at an Inland Regional Centre. Although there were indications both of them had been radicalised to some extent, Farook was also understood to have workplace grievances. Although some experts disagree on what is classed as a mass shooting, after the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre Congress defined it as a single incident where three or more homicides took place. This was done to enable states to ask the attorney general to intervene and investigate. In criminology terms, it relates to four homicides or more in a single incident."

Speaking to reporters in central London this week, Mr Dingle called for an open-ended Brexit transition period and expressed pessimism that technology or beefed-up infrastructure could fill the absence of a new customs agreement with the EU. He insisted his industry is ""shouting loudly"" about their concerns, but suggested there has been little response from ministers. ""You do feel as if you are banging your head against a brick wall,"" he said. ""Until this Government can find a resolution we're going to have to go on banging our heads against a brick wall."" Mr Dingle added: ""We are lost in politics and we want pragmatism over politics."" The UK's maritime sector comprises Britain's shipping industry and ports, as well as services such as ship financing and manufacture, including the building of superyachts. It is estimated to support close to one million jobs and contribute around £40bn to Britain's GDP. Mr Dingle was not gloomy about the long-term prospects for the ""strategically vital"" maritime industry after Brexit, if the Government fulfils its stated ambition for the UK to become a ""great trading nation"" outside of the EU. But he questioned if Britain's infrastructure, such as already clogged-up road and rail links to ports, would be ""up to the task"" of an increased export market - through new post-Brexit trade deals - without efforts to tackle existing congestion. The Prime Minister has repeatedly insisted the UK will leave the EU's customs union once outside the bloc, leaving Mr Dingle to warn about the short-term consequences of Brexit without another resolution for customs checks by March 2019. He explained how even a doubling of the time it takes lorries to get through the port of Dover, from two minutes to four minutes, could see permanent 20-mile-long motorway queues in Kent. Mr Dingle suggested the Government is ""hoping for a technology solution"" to customs checks by next year, but said that is ""unrealistic"". He added: ""It seems equally improbable, in the current climate, that there will be a political solution, that there will be an output of a 'deep and special relationship', which will mean that those lorries can continue to flow in an unimpeded fashion."" Mr Dingle accused the Government of adopting a ""[have] cake and eat it"" approach to a transition period, suggesting ministers want an interim deal - which could see the status quo maintained in UK-EU relations - but also ""want to act as if we are completely out of the EU"" during that time. He said: ""This gets mired in politics. Everyone believes in principle that a transition period is exactly what is necessary. ""What we hear coming from Brussels is that - despite the official statement that the transition will last until December 2020 - actually in Brussels, they will be pragmatic. ""But, here, it is all getting dragged down by politics."" Mr Dingle claimed a ""transition needs to be as long as it takes to transition"" to a future UK-EU relationship, adding: ""We believe that it is of such critical importance that some of more political considerations may need to give way to it."" Asked whether the proposed 18-month transition period until December 2020 would be long enough to find a technological or infrastructure solution to post-Brexit customs checks, Mr Dingle replied: ""I honestly don't know. For infrastructure, probably not."" The Department for Exiting the EU had not responded to a request for comment by the time of publication."

The party's national executive committee (NEC), which triggered the no confidence vote, has chosen Gerard Batten as interim leader. :: Farage: Henry Bolton could be our Corbyn :: UKIP leader echoes Trump as he refuses to go ""I hope that we'll have a period of stability and that Gerard will be allowed to remain in post as interim leader for an extended period of time,"" Mr Hamilton said. ""We still have to get a clean Brexit. The Government is bungling that by its own actions."" Party chairman Paul Oakden echoed Mr Hamilton's comments regarding the party's future, telling members at the meeting on Saturday to ""keep the faith"". ""We matter now more than we ever have,"" he said. :: Top UKIP figures quit :: Farage: UKIP could be 'worthless' in 18 months Mr Bolton had received the backing of Nigel Farage before the vote, with the former leader fearing another leadership contest would risk the party's ""self-destruction"". Writing in the Daily Telegraph on Friday, Mr Farage said: ""I believe it would be better to allow Mr Bolton, with all his faults, the chance to turn UKIP into an electoral machine again. ""The alternative is for the party to carry down the path of self-destruction into irrelevance. ""It may be too late to save UKIP, but you never know."" :: Bolton: Ex's 'racist' messages were doctored :: UKIP chairman to quit after leadership vote Whoever replaces Mr Bolton full-time will be UKIP's 10th permanent leader. The bookies' favourite is East of England MEP Tim Aker, followed by London Assembly member David Kurten and - despite having insisted he will not return again - Mr Farage. Interim leader Mr Batten - who told Mr Bolton to ""get on with the rest of your life"" following the vote - has not ruled out standing for the leadership on a permanent basis. Mr Bolton was only elected in September, following the party's disastrous result at last summer's General Election under Paul Nuttall. :: Sex, lies and donkeys: UKIP leaders quiz :: Farage: It's reform or die for UKIP"

He denied intending to kill the woman, who is in her 20s, but admitted two counts of rape, causing grievous bodily harm with intent and stealing her handbag. However, jurors found the ""exceptionally dangerous"" defendant guilty of attempted murder after he left the victim ""hanging by a thread"". Pearce, of Clarendon Park, Leicester, was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 11 years at the Old Bailey in London. He was handed seven-and-a-half years' custody for the rapes to run concurrently alongside his life sentence, with no separate penalty for the remaining charges. Sentencing the teenager, Mr Justice Haddon-Cave said the defendant had carried out an attack of a sexual or sadistic nature and that he ""intended to silence the victim forever"". ""The defendant set out that evening to mark his 17th birthday to find a woman to attack and violently rape,"" he said. ""He can be seen on CCTV circling the park and hunting (the victim) down as she walked through the park. The attack itself was of animistic savagery. The offending was exceptionally serious."" Pearce dragged the victim into undergrowth before hitting her over the head, the court heard. Police had been alerted after the start of his attack was witnessed by others in the park. However, the court was told officers were unable to find anything because of a lack of a precise location being reported. A passing cyclist spotted a pool of blood and a hair clip on the ground about an hour later and went into bushes and comforted the victim until paramedics arrived. The follow day, police issued a CCTV image of Pearce running towards the victim holding the slab. His family recognised him and informed officers. The victim awoke from a coma in the following weeks with no recollection of what had happened. ""I do not remember screaming when I was assaulted, though I am aware that screams were reported to the police by various people that night,"" she said in an emotional statement. ""My screams did not stop my attacker from causing me further harm and nor did they help me be found so I could receive medical care I needed. ""Knowing that my screams did not change anything for me that night continues to trouble me."" Phillip Bradley QC, defending, said Pearce accepted he was ""entirely responsible"" for the violence."

She also became the first Briton to successfully defend a Winter Olympics title. I WON THE OLYMPICS, AGAIN!!!!! #HistoryMaker Finishing four runs in 3 minutes, 27.28 seconds at Pyeongchang, she won by nearly half a second over Germany's Jacqueline Loelling. British team-mate Laura Deas won bronze by 0.02 seconds, giving Britain two medals in the same event for the first time in Winter Olympics history. Yarnold had been trailing leader Janine Flock of Austria going into the fourth and final run but she made up the deficit to win by 0.45 seconds. Flock, meanwhile, only managed 10th-fastest in the final heat and slipped to fourth place overall. The two embraced after the race, with Yarnold heard saying: ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry"" to console her competitor. ""I'm overwhelmed and exhausted,"" Yarnold said after her win. ""I don't really know how it happened. ""After the first run I wasn't sure whether I was going to be able to finish the race because my chest infection was so bad I was struggling to breathe and I got here only with the help of my team. ""My physio Louise just gave me a talking to before run two (on Saturday) and reminded me that I can do it and we can do it together. ""I guess four years ago, three years ago, the whole team all dared to dream that this was possible and I just went with all them (and) we managed it."" Yarnold, now Britain's most decorated Winter Olympian, had tweeted hours before the race: ""Got my eyes on the prize #OlympicFinal #DreamsComeTrue."" The sport involves a short sprint on ice before the competitor dives onto a sled and proceeds to fly along the track at speeds of over 100km per hour. British women have won a medal at every skeleton event since the sport was reintroduced to the Games in 2002, despite the lack of skeleton racing tracks in the country. With Izzy Atkin winning a bronze earlier, it is the first time ever that Britain have won three Winter Olympic medals in the same day. It had won two in Chamonix in 1924. It also means that Great Britain have equalled their previous best record of four medals at a Winter Games with a week to spare. Britain's other big hope for a medal, speed skater Elise Christie, crashed in the semi-finals of the 1500m, only days after doing the same in the 500m final. She fell badly but is hopeful of returning for the 1000m."

They are the same design as the outfits that have helped British Cycling to dominate the last three summer Games. :: FundingSkeleton has received over £6m worth of funding from UK Sport in the last quarter, the most of all the winter sports. In 2001, the skeleton programme had an annual budget of £10,000. Still, even the current figure is peanuts compared to the £23m allocated to athletics. :: Self-sacrifice""I beasted myself,"" says Amy Williams, after she failed to qualify for Turin 2006.

Britain won bronze medals at the 1924 and 1948 Olympics, before the sport was then dropped from the schedules until 2002. But it was still popular in the British military."
2018-02-17,Rural communities with little or no wireless internet are getting an unlikely boost from churches hosting satellite dishes.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180218031546/https://news.sky.com/story/how-church-steeples-boost-wifi-connectivity-in-rural-communities-11255800,"St Giles Church in rural Essex is what you might expect of a 15th Century parish church. The stone building is on a small hill surrounded by acres of green valleys, farms and a smattering of houses. It is right in the middle of the village of Great Maplestead. But look closely and you will spot this medieval church has some very modern additions. Perched atop the church tower is a small satellite dish and four telecoms transmitters that provide high-speed broadband to around 120 local households, which previously had no or limited coverage. The antenna was installed two years ago by a broadband operator that specialises in connecting rural communities to the internet. The church is paid rent for hosting the kit, which has been carefully designed and camouflaged so as not mar the aesthetic of the ancient building. ""Some people were worried that we were going to damage the church,"" vicar Revd Gay Ellis told Sky News. ""Or that it would look out of place, or is it right for us as a Church to be doing this sort of thing? ""But the more we got involved in it, and the more people understood about it, they realised that this was really part of the Church's mission. This was a type of ministry."" The Government has recognised the role that rural parish churches can play in improving internet and mobile connectivity. Some 65% of Anglican churches and 66% of parishes in England are in rural areas and their central village locations and tall spires mean they are often well placed to address connectivity and coverage problems. A new accord between the Government and the Church of England hopes to streamline the process of mobile and broadband operators getting the equipment installed. The agreement is designed to cut down on bureaucracy and red-tape and make it easier for individual parishes to make their own decisions over the installation. There is clear guidance to ensure the telecoms infrastructure does not impact on the character and architectural or historic significance of the church building. Matt Hancock, Minister for Digital, Media, Culture and Sport, said: ""This agreement with the Church of England will mean that even a 15th Century building can help make Britain fit for the future, improving people’s lives by boosting connectivity in some of our hardest-to-reach areas."" At present, around 5% of UK households do not have access to superfast broadband, and 10% of the UK does not have reliable mobile phone coverage. That was the case in Great Maplestead. But the introduction of the antenna on the church tower now means local residents now have access to internet speeds of up to 40MB/s for both upload and download. ""It was almost life-saving, certainly business saving,"" a local resident told Sky News. ""I'm a photographer and need to send pictures to London and get instructions from London via email. It used to take 25 to 30 minutes to download a simple PDF so this was really vital for us."""
2018-02-17,"Henry Bolton became leader 142 days ago. And for 142 days in the sun, he has lost, more or less everything.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180218031546/https://news.sky.com/story/whither-ousted-ukip-leader-henry-bolton-11255778,"He has lost his wife, his family, his day job and today he lost the leadership of the party which had thrust him into the spotlight. When he became leader, 142 days ago, I was in the hall in Torquay. I remember that he was elected on a promise to professionalise the party. When I asked him, a few days ago, how that was going, he could only wince. Instead of professionalisation, his leadership has seen the party sink to new lows of infighting and humiliation. After the revelations of his mistress Jo Marney's racism, he received a unanimous vote of no confidence in his leadership from the party's National Executive Committee. Since then he has experienced the undoing of his private life and intense media scrutiny, which he compared to me as akin to that endured by Princess Diana. He hoped he could survive. Going into the make or break meeting, I was told that he had good reason to be hopeful. Nigel Farage had backed him; he had coachloads of supporters being brought in and he had apparently re-geared the race into a referendum on the unpopular NEC. Yet in the end, it wasn't even close. What happened? The media were banned from the meeting itself but sources who were inside tell me that to some extent, Mr Bolton lost it on the day. He made a bellicose speech which barely mentioned the allegations against him. He appeared ""arrogant"" and ""without contrition"". He launched a blistering attack on the NEC which he slammed as: ""The enemy within. The only loyalty these people have is to themselves. Their actions are despicable."" Mr Bolton's opponents were equally unforgiving. Sources tell me that Steve Crowther, former acting leader, speaking on behalf of the NEC, was scathing, ""going hard on Bolton lying to his family and wife"". Mr Crowther said: ""It is not that he has done wrong but that he refuses to accept that he has done wrong. ""It is not about the morality of what he has done but his political judgement. He has developed a reputation for being unreachable and always late. He is also a liar."" He then accused Mr Bolton of telling untruths about his CV. Up to then the forces seemed evenly balanced, with both sides being booed and heckled. The game-changer came when Paul Oakden, chairman of the party, addressed the crowd and revealed that Mr Bolton had only days before threatened to try and stop the Emergency General Meeting with legal action. In his right of reply, Mr Bolton did not deny this but indeed threatened it again. This did not go down well with the undecided voters. Threatening to sue your own party is not a good look. At that moment a source texted me: ""He's a goner."" The meeting was bitter and nasty but the rebels succeeded and Mr Bolton is gone. But for how much longer? On Thursday, Mr Bolton confirmed to me that he ""had three options"" if he lost. Today he confirmed to me that he was considering running for leader again. He said: ""You can't keep a good man down. You certainly haven't heard the last of me in politics."" He might well run again, there is nothing to prohibit him from doing so under the party's rules. He received 37% of the no-confidence vote. Under the UKIP's First Past the Post electoral system, he need not get a majority of the votes in a leadership contest, just one more than the second placed candidate. Talking to those in the hall, he clearly has supporters who would rally to his cause again. Senior UKIP figures are disparaging of the prospect. Welsh leader Neil Hamilton told me ""that he might well run, as he's shown he's no stranger to humiliation"". Gerard Batten, the interim leader, said that if he is thinking about it Mr Bolton should ""get a life"". But as a senior UKIP source told me: ""He might well do it, because he's lost everything else."" He is chasing the dying of the light. Whatever happens to Mr Bolton, his is a sorry tale but UKIP's story could be sorrier still. It is now on its seventh leader in 18 months. It faces the prospect of another leadership election which it cannot afford. It heads into a set of local elections where it is defending hundreds of seats, with no permanent leader. There are even rumours that its great hero Mr Farage - his spell over the apparently party broken - might set up a new party with former donor Aaron Banks. One woman will be relieved: Theresa May. The hardest proponents of the hardest Brexit are off the battlefield. That gives her breathing space on her Eurosceptic flank. In the end, UKIP have simply lost their reason to be. Like Del Boy after he finally became a millionaire, now their lifetime ambition of Brexit has been achieved, they just do not quite know quite what to do with themselves. The sticking plaster, which bound this disparate band of libertarians, social conservatives, economic protectionists, working class socialists and shire Tories together, has been ripped off. There's not much left. UKIP have been written off before. But in Birmingham, the stench of death is everywhere. As one source texted me as we all headed for home: ""Dead within a year, I reckon."""

But away from the glitz and red carpet, there are some profound questions facing the film business, which has developed into one of the most rapidly growing sectors of the British economy. Its growth has been supported by a group of factors. For one thing, successive governments have maintained tax incentives to encourage companies to make films in Britain. For another, some huge blockbuster series have made their homes in the UK - James Bond, Harry Potter and now Star Wars. Their presence has helped to encourage the growth of a skilled workforce and cutting-edge technology. There's the advantage of the English language, a great attraction for many American production companies, as well as easy access to many specialist support services - London, for instance, plays home to some of the world's greatest visual effects businesses. Put that altogether and you get an industry that has stormed away from its doldrums of 30 years ago and is now thriving. Indeed, Pinewood Studios will shortly open another new sound stage, the latest installment of a £200m investment programme. Adrian Wootton is the chief executive of the British Film Commission, an industry veteran and a man who think British movie-making has never had it so good. He told me: ""We could easily over the next five to 10 years double the size of the revenues generated for UK plc. ""We're already a $3bn-a-year business - bigger than pharmaceuticals now in the UK in terms of employment and the revenues we generate. We have a lot of potential still to exploit."" But there are challenges and, like just about every other business, the movie industry is having to work out how to handle Brexit. In the short term, few doubt it's been a boost - so much revenue comes from America that the devaluation of the pound helped increase revenue overnight. But there are also fears over what Brexit will mean for the industry's small army of skilled foreign workers. Few sectors of the economy require such a global outlook as the movie business, where actors, directors, producers and technical skill move around the world. It's not just the business leaders who fret. Actor and director Andy Serkis told Sky News: ""I feel like that we're going to lose out so much on cultural exchange and this is a huge part of that. ""People from all over the world can work here, not only Europe but particularly Europe. What we have to offer, in the way that the film industry creates other industries around it - I hope that is not damaged."" Sir William Sargent is the chief executive and founder of Framestore, one of the world's foremost visual effects companies. He has led his team to Oscars, BAFTAs and Emmy awards, and says his workforce includes people from every country in the European Union. ""We need access to talented foreign people to help grow the business,"" he tells me. ""We simply cannot get enough British people with the right talents - British universities don't generate enough students with the rights skills for us. So I worry that Brexit might restrict my ability to access that talent to work in London."" Sir William predicts that his businesses in other parts of the world, including China, Canada and America, will grow quicker than his British business in the years to come. But he says there is still a huge opportunity for the UK industry - as long as it is bold and ambitious in searching out new customers. ""In Europe and America we have less than one billion consumers who consume what we do; in Asia, between India and China, and all the countries around them, there are about four billion. ""That is the scale of the prize and that is the scale of the positioning that we have the opportunity for in the UK. ""And if we do not do it in the next five or 10 years, then we will only have ourselves to blame."""

""This is the largest earthquake in mainland UK since the 5.2 magnitude Market Rasen earthquake in 2008,"" he said. Twitter users described their surprise as the aftershock was felt over a hundred miles away. Tina Anton wrote on Twitter: ""Just had a tremor as in earthquake in Cornwall!

A post-mortem examination found she had been raped and beaten. On Friday, her family's lawyer Didier Seban said Michel Fourniret, who was jailed for life in 2008 for killing seven girls, was interviewed by magistrates in Paris and admitted murdering Ms Parrish along with French teenager Marie-Angele Domece. Ms Domece disappeared in 1988 and her body has never been found. Mr Seban said: ""He made detailed and repeated confessions. He clearly recognises, and this several times over, having killed Joanna Parrish and Marie-Angele Domece. ""It's a new development, a resolution of the affair, it seems, in a remarkable way... it's hard (for the family) but the end of a long legal battle."" He said he hoped Fourniret, who was dubbed the Ogre of the Ardennes over his previous killings, would now stand trial for Parrish's murder. Prosecutors in Paris would not comment on the apparent confession with an investigation now under way. A lawyer for Fourniret would not respond to a news agency request for comment. The serial killer had initially been charged with kidnapping and murdering Ms Parrish and Ms Domece in 2008 but the court of appeal dismissed the case in 2011. His wife Monique Olivier had twice accused him of being responsible for the killings but later retracted her claims. Mr Seban said she would have to be questioned again. Fourniret had always denied murdering Ms Parrish and Ms Domece, including during his 2008 trial at which he was found guilty of murdering the seven girls. Olivier was found guilty of being complicit in five murders and jailed for life. She has been ordered to serve at least 28 years in jail. In 2012, the court of appeal cancelled a dismissal order on Fourniret and asked for the investigation to resume in light of new leads in the case."

He alleges he gave Mr Corbyn cash in return for information. A spokesman for Mr Corbyn, who has been the MP for Islington North since 1983, said Mr Sarkocy's story ""has more plot holes in it than a bad James Bond movie"". The former agent, whose spy name was Jan Dymic, said Mr Corbyn was named Agent Cob and met with him in the House of Commons, The Sun reported. Documents show Mr Corbyn met Mr Sarkocy in the House of Commons in 1986, at his constituency office in 1987 and in Parliament later that year, according to the newspaper. In the third meeting it is alleged Mr Corbyn warned the Czech about British operations against Soviet agents by handing him a newspaper cutting warning that MI5 was investigating suspected spies. However the spy dismissed the Labour Party's suggestion Mr Corbyn believed he was just a diplomat. ""Everybody knew that 'diplomat' was just a cover for spy,"" he told Czech media. ""It was a conscious co-operation. Diplomat and agent were the same thing. Corbyn was recruited. He also received money."" Mr Sarkocy, who was expelled from the UK by Margaret Thatcher and lives in Bratislava, said the information Mr Corbyn supplied was ""rated in Moscow as the number one"". He added: ""Mr Corbyn was an honest man, but stupid."" The former spy, 64, said the MP was told he could move to Russia if he got in trouble with the British authorities. But the Labour leader's spokesman insisted Mr Corbyn has never had any links with the Czech communist regime. He said: ""As Svetlana Ptacnikova, director of the Czech Security Forces Archive, has made clear, Jeremy was neither an agent, asset, informer nor collaborator with Czechoslovak intelligence. ""These claims are a ridiculous smear and entirely false. ""The former Czechoslovak agent Jan Sarkocy’s account of his meeting with Jeremy was false 30 years ago, is false now and has no credibility whatsoever. ""His story has more plot holes in it than a bad James Bond movie."" Ms Ptacnikova said: ""Mr Corbyn was neither registered [by the StB] as a collaborator, nor does this [his alleged collaboration] stem from archive documents."" She said the pair met for talks but he was not a spy. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said Mr Corbyn ""cannot be trusted"". ""Time and time again he has sided with those who want to destroy everything that is great about this country,"" he said. ""That he met foreign spies is a betrayal of this country. He cannot be trusted."""

They survived but 12 people at the scene were killed and another died later in a hospital, Oaxaca's attorney general's office said. Fifteen more people were injured. The officials had been looking at damage from the quake, which hit the rural state and Mexico City on Friday evening. Mr Navarrete told the Televisa network that the helicopter pilot had lost control of the aircraft some 22 miles southwest of the quake's epicentre. The helicopter had been at a height of about 40m (130ft), he added. According to a Televisa reporter who had been on board, the helicopter had dropped after generating a large cloud of dust on its landing field. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto wrote on Twitter: ""Unfortunately, several people on the ground lost their lives and others were injured. ""My condolences to your relatives and my desire to promptly recover the injured."" The 7.2 magnitude earthquake has not caused any deaths but dozens of buildings have been damaged and power has been cut to about a million people. According to the Interior Department, 50 homes suffered significant structural damage in Santiago Jamiltepec, Oaxaca state, along with other damage to the city hall and main church. Nearly one million people lost power, but it was expected to be restored over the course of Saturday."
2018-02-17,Toys R Us UK faces crashing into administration at the end of the month unless it can find new investors prepared to shoulder a £15m tax bill.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180218031546/https://news.sky.com/story/taxman-takes-ailing-toys-r-us-to-the-brink-with-15m-vat-demand-11252913,"Sky News has learnt that advisers to Britain's biggest standalone toy retailer are racing to secure a rescue deal for the business by the middle of next week, just days ahead of a 27 February deadline to meet a mammoth VAT demand. Sources said the company, which employs more than 3,000 people in the UK, would work through this weekend in an effort to progress talks with potential bidders. The Entertainer, a privately owned chain, and Alteri Investors, an acquirer of distressed retailers, are understood to have held talks in the last fortnight about buying parts of Toys R Us UK, although their ongoing interest was unclear on Friday. Hilco Capital, which salvaged the music and entertainment retailer HMV in 2013, is understood to have tabled a proposal that would involve taking on only a minority of Toys R Us' 105 British outlets. Hilco is likely to remain interested in a deal only if it is structured as a pre-pack administration, according to a source close to the process. Sky News revealed earlier this month that advisers to Toys R Us were racing to secure bids for the loss-making business - which only made it through Christmas after investors backed a major financial restructuring involving the closure of a quarter of its shops. The entire European operations of the ailing retailer are also on the market, encompassing 236 stores outside the UK in 10 countries including Austria, France, Germany and Spain. Toys R Us' UK and European businesses are being sold through separate processes being run by Lazard and Alvarez & Marsal. With only 11 days remaining before the £15m VAT bill is due, the prospect of Toys R Us UK avoiding insolvency proceedings look increasingly bleak. Such a move would cast grave doubt on the future of a brand which has had a presence in the UK since 1985 - along with about 3,200 workers. Poor Christmas trading has left the British business facing cashflow issues, with one insider saying earlier this month that it looked ""close to unsaveable"". Weak retail sales growth data published on Friday by the Office for National Statistics added to the sense of pessimism engulfing the high street. Toys R Us UK has already been planning to shed up to 800 jobs through a process called a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), which was approved by creditors just three days before Christmas. ‎The CVA is intended to provide breathing space for Toys R Us UK to improve its fortunes by closing 26 of its loss-making stores and securing big rent reductions at many others. Under that plan, which won the backing of 98% of creditors, including the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), its loss-making larger stores are due to begin closing in the spring.‎ The CVA deal secured the 11th-hour support of the PPF after the company agreed to pay almost £10m into its pension scheme over the next three years. Without a new owner being found, the Toys R Us UK pension scheme - which is tens of millions of pounds in deficit - will be absorbed by the PPF. Any such move is set to attract renewed attention from Frank Field, the Labour chairman of the Commons Work and Pensions Select Committee. Shortfalls in defined benefit pension schemes are facing intense scrutiny following the collapse of Carillion, the construction group which fell into liquidation with a Section 75 pension deficit of £2.6bn. Specialist toy retailers endured tough festive trading amid competition from Amazon and other online rivals, with Toys R Us now planning to close about 180 US shops - roughly 20% of the total - in the coming months. In the UK, retailers including BHS, Focus DIY and JJB Sports have previously used CVAs to exit loss-making stores, although all three companies ultimately succumbed to the fast-changing retail environment. New Look is now working on a similar plan, while House of Fraser is seeking rent reductions from landlords. The effort to overhaul its UK estate follows the filing by Toys R Us' American parent for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in September. There has since been controversy over payments to UK executives and the write-off of a big loan owed to the UK company. When the CVA was approved, Steve Knights, the managing director of the UK business,‎ hailed the ""strong support for our business plan... so that we can better serve our customers today and long into the future"". A source said the full list of European countries where Toys R Us' operations were on the market also included Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Poland and Portugal.‎ In the US, Toys R Us has won a court order to allow it to retain liquidators to close nearly 200 of its shops.‎ A spokesman for Toys R Us UK declined to comment."

The ship was forced to make an emergency stop at the New South Wales town of Eden so that six men and three teenage boys could be removed. Another 14 passengers, including women and children, also left the ship, police said. The 23 are believed to be members of the same family. The ship and its remaining passengers eventually docked in Melbourne on Saturday. Passengers said the ship's security staff had been heavy-handed while trying to contain the brawl and had made the situation worse. Passenger Michael Haddara told The Age: ""They put handcuffs around their hands as knuckle dusters. ""They were punching women, 16-year-old kids, everything. ""They called up the mechanical people from down the bottom, the big boys, to intimidate and basically do what they want."" He also said security staff had taken phones from passengers who were filming the fight. Jarrah Bolitho said the family had been ""roaming the decks looking for people to fight"" and that security staff did their best under difficult circumstances. ""There's not much else they could have done. They had to do something."" Kellie Petersen, who was on the cruise with her husband and their three children, said trouble on board had been ""brewing for days"". ""They were looking for trouble from the minute they got on the ship,"" she told Melbourne's 3AW. ""My husband said to take it away, because there's kids here, and five of them surrounded my husband. ""They told us to watch our backs."" Many other passengers locked themselves in their rooms to avoid the chaos. The incident is being investigated by the cruise company and New South Wales marine Area Command. Carnival general manager Jennifer Vandekreek said: ""We sincerely apologise to our guests who were impacted by the disruptive behaviour of the group removed from the ship."" ""With regards to the guests who were involved in the incident, we are fully cooperating with the NSW police. ""We are also conducting a full investigation and will take appropriate corrective action as necessary."""

""It's been a long journey to get to this point and I think it's just the start of an ongoing incredible journey for our country,"" the 27-year-old celebrity said. Kosovo see you soon we’re on our way!! Independence day!! So excited for the show tonight!! pic.twitter.com/OLlGf7yyGi Earlier she had tweeted to tell her 6.78 million followers she was ""so excited for the show"", which kicked off in the city's main square on Saturday evening. Ora has returned to her birthplace a number of times since finding stardom with tracks like How We Do and Poison, including for the filming of the music video for her 2012 hit Shine Ya Light. And in 2015, she was named an honorary ambassador for the country by the then president Atifete Jahjaga. When her family fled, less than a year after she was born, Kosovo was still under the repressive rule of Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic, who stripped the Yugoslav province of its autonomy. In 1998, war broke out between Serbian troops and Kosovo's ethnic Albanian rebels, leaving 13,000 people dead and a subsequent NATO bombing campaign against Belgrade. Kosovo subsequently received the protection of the UN and, with the support of the US and other western powers, declared independence on 17 February 2008. Serbia is still yet to recognise its sovereignty, however, as is Russia, Spain, Greece and several other EU countries. Prime Minister Haradinaj said on Saturday: ""The state of Kosovo has upheld the people's demand for freedom."" But he did acknowledge it was not yet a truly ""modern state"", with 30% of its 1.8 million people unemployed and small factions of its population still loyal to Serbia. US President Donald Trump said ahead of the anniversary: ""While more work must be done, we applaud your progress."""

Responding to allegations reported by the Mail on Sunday, Mr Cox admitted that some of his conduct towards women during his time with Save the Children would have made feel them ""uncomfortable"". The father-of-two said he would ""take full responsibility"" for his actions during his time with Save the Children and has stood down from his roles at The Jo Cox Foundation and More In Common, which he helped set up. The Mail on Sunday reports that in the year before his wife was fatally shot and stabbed by a far-right terrorist during the Brexit referendum campaign in June 2016, Mr Cox sexually harassed a Save the Children worker outside a bar in London. The 39-year-old acknowledged he ""made mistakes"" before leaving the charity, but he claimed the allegations against him were a ""massive exaggeration"". He denied a further allegation in the newspaper that he forced himself on a woman during a trip to Harvard University. ""I want to apologise deeply and unreservedly for my past behaviour and for the hurt and offence that I have caused,"" he said. ""In the aftermath of Jo's murder, I promised that I would dedicate my life to two things, firstly loving and protecting our children and secondly fighting the hatred that killed Jo. ""In the last few days allegations from several years ago have resurfaced that makes concentrating on both of those tasks much more difficult. For that reason, while away over half-term, I decided to step down from my current public roles for the time being."" Mr Cox continued: ""While I do not accept the allegations contained in the 2015 complaint to the police in Cambridge, Massachusetts, I do acknowledge and understand that during my time at Save the Children I made mistakes and behaved in a way that caused some women hurt and offence. ""This was never malicious but it was certainly inappropriate. ""In the past I have focused on disputing what I felt was untrue in the allegations, but I realise now that it's more important to take full responsibility for what I have done. ""I am committed to holding myself to much higher standards of personal conduct in the future."" His resignation from The Jo Cox Foundation was accepted by its board, who said they admired the ""integrity, commitment and dedication"" he showed to create a ""positive legacy"" for his wife, who he married in 2009. A colleague at the Jo Cox Foundation told Sky News: ""The person described in these allegations is not the Brendan we know. ""Brendan is a very responsible guy, which is why he has decided to stand down. ""People have looked up to him and while we are all upset to read some of the stuff that has been printed, those people need to know that they are right to admire him for everything he has said and done since Jo's death."""

One of the ID cards they faked showed Mr Cameron, complete with 10 Downing Street as an address. Dragomir, 34, was sentenced to seven years and six months after being found guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud, conspiracy to money launder, possession of fake ID documents and possession of equipment adapted for making fake ID documents. Cirstoiu, 37, the mastermind of the scam, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud, conspiracy to money launder and money laundering and was sentenced to six years behind bars on Friday. Dragomir, a Romanian national formerly of Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, was arrested in June last year and found to be living under a false name, renting office space in Enfield. He was wanted under a European Arrest Warrant for fraud convictions dating back to 2007. When officers searched his Enfield office, they found a fake ID factory, with equipment to mass produce counterfeit cards. Sample ID cards created to advertise the services were also found, as well as a picture of an ID card bearing Mr Cameron's picture. The two men had foot soldiers who would open the accounts for them and withdraw money from ATMs. Three of them - George Cerneanu, 25, Georgian Alexandru Stanciu, 27, and Maria Bilici, 33 - were jailed for a total of 11 years.

The UK's counter-terror apparatus is of huge benefit to Europe - the security advantages are too important for EU countries to lose. It works both ways, mind. Britain benefits from the sharing of data connected to known criminals or terrorists in Europe. On Friday, the Heads of MI6, France's DGSE and Germany's BND came together to call for an agreement that will allow this exchange of information to continue post-Brexit. Largely speaking, everyone's on the same side here. But this was a speech for two audiences - the lofty collection of world leaders in the hall itself, and her party back home in Britain. At home lies a potential hurdle. Her pledge to ""respect"" the rules of the European Court of Justice won't go down well with Brexiteers. If May wants Britain to remain a within Europol or a stay part of the European Arrest Warrant, then it's hard to see how she can negotiate that and not be in some part under the jurisdiction of the ECJ. That's a battle she'll have to win another day. Today, May's speech did nothing to win Europe round to Brexit. It did little to convince the international sceptics that Britain isn't in retreat. But it did get a gentle nod of approval from Brussels. She'll take that."

But the PM had stronger words for EU officials on a future security deal after the transition period ends - expected to be at the end of 2020.

The Save The Children report did not implicate any specific organisation by name. The charity found children in Haiti, southern Sudan and the Ivory Coast were being coerced into sex, forced into sexual slavery, and being offered food in return for performing sex acts, with a 15-year-old girl offered the equivalent of £2 and some chocolate to perform a sex act on ""a couple of humanitarian men"". More than 340 people were spoken to in total, revealing ""inadequate"" safeguarding against ""significant levels of abuse of boys and girls"", much of which was inflicted during emergencies and went unreported. :: Oxfam re-hired man fired over sex misconduct claim :: Oxfam's shamed ex-Haiti chief hits back at 'lies' Responding to the emergence of the report, a spokesman for Oxfam told Sky News the charity knew about the concerns raised, but that measures put in place to address the situation were ""insufficient"". ""As a result of the Save the Children report, a senior member of Oxfam staff visited Haiti to assess the situation for himself and measures were put in place,"" they said. ""However, these measures proved insufficient and could have been compromised by staff who were later investigated by Oxfam and found guilty of misconduct."" :: Oxfam ambassador Livia Firth speaks of 'betrayal' :: Opinion: Oxfam has proved we can't trust them The report - which uncovered ""every kind of child sexual abuse and exploitation imaginable"" - found that children were fearful of telling anyone about what was happening because they thought they might lose out on future aid. Save the Children recommended the establishment of a global watchdog to evaluate how agencies tackled abuse, including the launch of an effective complaints procedure. The report came to light just hours after Oxfam chief executive Mark Goldring bemoaned the ""scale and intensity"" of the criticism the charity had received over the scandal. :: Aid worker: 'I was raped by a fellow humanitarian' :: Charity boss urges victims to come forward In an interview with The Guardian, Mr Goldring reiterated his apology for the charity's failings, but accused critics of ""gunning"" for his organisation. He said: ""The intensity and the ferocity of the attack makes you wonder, what did we do? We murdered babies in their cots? Certainly, the scale and the intensity of the attacks feels out of proportion to the level of culpability."" Mr Goldring's comments sparked a backlash online, with observers accusing him of an ""utter lack of self-awareness"" and ""staggering insensitivity"". Baroness Nicholson, who founded and runs the AMAR Foundation - which helps war-ravaged communities in the Middle East to rebuild - told Sky News the scandal was evidence that charities like Oxfam needed to be monitored. :: Do we spend too much on foreign aid? :: 'Why we should support Oxfam' ""Without monitoring, aid agencies will inevitably go mad and that's what happened,"" she said. ""So it's a root and branch reform of this whole aid institution exercise. It's become an industry instead of something that really minds about each individual child. Since the allegations came to light, Oxfam has issued an ""unreserved apology"" to the Government, donors, supporters and the people of Haiti over its handling of the claims, and agreed to stop bidding for Government funding. Oxfam ambassadors Archbishop Desmond Tutu and actress Minnie Driver have since quit their roles with the charity following the scandal."

But Mr Gyimah cautioned against expecting radical reforms, stressing the question of how to fund higher education was a ""tough"" issue that would require ""some very tough trade-offs"". Universities Minister @SamGyimah responds to questions about high levels of interest on student loans #Paterson pic.twitter.com/LPmjdbrb6H Prime Minister Theresa May will set out further details in a speech on Monday. Ahead of that address, Education Secretary Damian Hinds expanded on what would be included in the review. He suggested the fees charged should be based on the cost of delivering a course and a graduate's likely future earnings, as well as the needs of the country. This could mean a reduction in how much those taking arts and humanities courses are charged. Mr Hinds said: ""I don't think politicians are going to be setting the cost and the prices for different courses. ""All forms of education, all courses, all subjects have great value, have great worth. ""What we need to look at is the different aspects of pricing - the cost that it is to put on the course, the value that it is to the student and also the value to our society as a whole and to our economy for the future. ""There are some subjects, some areas both in higher education and technical education where we are going to need more of those coming forward in the future because of the changes, because of the new challenges in the world economy."" On suggestions the interest rate on loans could be examined, Mr Hinds said: ""The panel can look at these different aspects. We absolutely can't look at one aspect of the situation in isolation from the others."" When asked if the alternative idea of a graduate tax would be investigated Mr Hinds said the review would ""look at alternatives"". But he added: ""We think it's right that if you benefit from a university degree you should make a contribution. ""That is what this current system does. What we are doing in the review is looking at how that system works, making sure there are alternatives, making sure there is more variety."" A spokesman for the Russell Group of universities said: ""Any changes to the current funding model need to be fair and affordable to students, while still meeting the needs of taxpayers and universities in providing students with a high-quality education and experience."" Sally Hunt, general secretary of the University and College Union (UCU), called for the review to be ""radical and explore genuine alternatives to the current system, not just tinker at the edges of the current failed system"". Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner claimed Conservative policies had ""decimated"" higher education. Labour has pledged to abolish tuition fees altogether if it gets into power and reintroduce maintenance grants for students. Ms Rayner told the BBC: ""We have had three announcements of reviews in the last 12 months and eight years of the Conservatives that have damaged higher education and totally decimated our further education infrastructure. ""Another review isn't going to solve the problem of the hike in interest rates which this Government has done and the tripling of tuition fees. ""Most students have said that the removal of maintenance grants is one of the biggest barriers to them at the moment and the Government has said nothing on that."" Mr Hinds defended the Tories' stance on maintenance grants, saying the decision to scrap them in favour of maintenance loans allowed students to have access to more money for living costs."
2018-02-18,The sister of murdered MP Jo Cox has said the family will support her widower over accusations of sexual harassment.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180219035620/https://news.sky.com/story/jo-coxs-sister-we-will-support-widower-brendan-amid-harassment-claims-11256188,"Brendan Cox has quit two charities set up in his wife's name following the claims and apologised for the ""hurt and offence"" that some of his past behaviour had caused. In a statement, Kim Leadbeater said: ""This is another very difficult day for our family"". She added: ""As a family we will support Brendan as he endeavours to do the right thing by admitting mistakes he may have made in the past, and we respect him for doing so. ""We all make mistakes. Brendan is a wonderful father and I have no doubt about the happiness he brought to Jo. ""My other focus is to wholeheartedly continue the work I have begun through the More in Common movement at a local and national level and to support The Jo Cox Foundation in continuing its valuable work."" A colleague at the Jo Cox Foundation told Sky News: ""The person described in these allegations is not the Brendan we know."" They added: ""People have looked up to him and while we are all upset to read some of the stuff that has been printed, those people need to know that they are right to admire him for everything he has said and done since Jo's death."" The claims against Mr Cox were made by a former colleague at Save the Children and reported in the Mail on Sunday. It was claimed that in the year before his wife was fatally shot and stabbed by a far-right terrorist during the Brexit referendum campaign in June 2016, Mr Cox sexually harassed one of the charity's workers outside a bar in London. The 39-year-old acknowledged he ""made mistakes"" before leaving Save the Children, but he claimed the allegations against him were a ""massive exaggeration"". He denied a further allegation in the newspaper that he forced himself on a woman during a trip to Harvard University. In an interview with the Mail on Sunday, Mr Cox refused to say what his wife - who he married in 2009 - knew of the claims. But he did say: ""We never pretended that we had the perfect relationship, or the perfect marriage. ""We had difficult times, we had amazing times, but I'm not going to recount conversations I had with her because she's not here."" ""Hopefully we are seeing a change now in climate and culture"" says @YvetteCooperMP on sexual harassment #Paterson pic.twitter.com/IxGLeUcTfG Mr Cox admitted there were ""instances"" where his behaviour had made people feel uncomfortable and were viewed as inappropriate, adding: ""I think that charge is a fair one."" He continued: ""Certainly, I had too much to drink at times. ""I probably behaved in a way I thought was sort of jokey, or flirtatious. I often wasn't being serious, but that was perceived differently by others."" Labour MP Yvette Cooper told Sky's Sunday with Niall Paterson show that Mr Cox has ""done the right thing"", adding ""there is a wider issue here"". She said: ""Hopefully we are seeing a change in climate and culture, where people are recognising that those in positions of power should not abuse positions of power, those who end up becoming victims of harassment should have support to speak out and there should be systems in place that allow this to be dealt with."" Save the Children has responded to the Mail on Sunday's reports, saying the safety and wellbeing of its staff is ""of the utmost importance"" and that the complaints were investigated. The charity said in a statement: ""When complaints are made we investigate in accordance with our procedures. This was exactly the case in 2015. Mr Cox was suspended and a disciplinary process commenced. ""The panel included independent trustees and a QC, and the process was administered by a London law firm. Mr Cox resigned before it could be completed."" It added that it would not be complacent and its safeguarding processes are always evolving. ""Like others in the charity sector, we are now looking again at our processes for handling complaints. It is vital that our hard-working staff, our beneficiaries and those who work with us are safe and can speak out without fear if they have any concerns,"" it said. ""Kevin Watkins, who took over as chief executive in late 2016, told UK staff last week that he would show 'zero tolerance' of any disrespectful behaviour. Mr Watkins has ordered a review to establish whether the system for dealing with complaints about behaviour in the workplace can be further improved. This will involve staff, trustees and external independent professionals, and will report to Mr Watkins directly."""

The women say they stand united with the Time's Up movement in calling for an end to harassment and abuse in a world ""ripe for change"" - and urge other women to ""be part of this"". At the BAFTA ceremony on Sunday night, some of the film industry's biggest stars will be joined by activists on the red carpet, with attendees also wearing black in solidarity with Time's Up. The letter, which follows the Hollywood sexual harassment scandal surrounding Harvey Weinstein, says the British film and TV industry has a ""huge"" role in promoting a ""vision of an equal society"". ""We believe we need to use our power as communicators and connectors to shift the way society sees and treats us,"" the letter says. ""We need to examine the kind of womanhood our industry promotes and sells to the world. :: BAFTAs 2018: Who will win and who should? ""As we approach the BAFTAs – our industry’s time for celebration and acknowledgement – we hope we can celebrate this tremendous moment of solidarity.

His parents want to treat him with cannabis oil, which is illegal in the UK. In September, he and his parents, Hannah Deacon and Drew Dingley, went to the Netherlands so he could take a cannabis-based medicine prescribed by paediatric neurologist. This reduced his seizures in number, duration and severity. But the family could not afford to continue the treatment and had to return to the UK where they concentrated on lobbying for a cannabis licence. The Home Office has now denied the licence, saying that the drug ""cannot be practically prescribed, administered or supplied to the public"". The decision comes despite support from some MPs, including those in the all-party parliamentary group on drug policy reform. Alfie's seizures can be controlled in hospital but his long-term prospects include being institutionalised with psychosis. In a statement, a Home Office spokesman said: ""We recognise that people with chronic pain and debilitating illnesses are looking to alleviate their symptoms. ""However, it is important that medicines are thoroughly tested to ensure they meet rigorous standards before being placed on the market, so that doctors and patients are assured of their efficacy, quality and safety. ""Cannabis is listed as a Schedule 1 drug, as in its raw form it is not recognised in the UK as having any medicinal benefit and is therefore subject to strict control restrictions. ""This means it cannot be practically prescribed, administered, or supplied to the public in the UK, and can only be used for research under a Home Office licence. ""The Home Office would not issue a licence to enable the personal consumption of a Schedule 1 drug."" Alfie's grandmother, Maggie Deacon, said by using the oil he had ""gone from a death sentence to the prospect of a more normal life with school, friends and fun in his own familiar home"". She added: ""We want the people who have the power to give him this gift to put themselves in the position of Alfie's family, to think creatively and with open minds and to find a way forward. ""Above all we want compassion to find a way round inflexible rules."""

Police received reports a man had jumped from a second-storey flat window and onto the roof of a stationary black Hyundai, smashing the windows of several other cars as he fled the scene. A number of people were also allegedly assaulted. Officers were called at 7.40am on Tuesday and entered a flat in Swan Street, where they found the body of Ms Richardson.

The UK's counter-terror apparatus is of huge benefit to Europe - the security advantages are too important for EU countries to lose. It works both ways, mind. Britain benefits from the sharing of data connected to known criminals or terrorists in Europe. On Friday, the Heads of MI6, France's DGSE and Germany's BND came together to call for an agreement that will allow this exchange of information to continue post-Brexit. Largely speaking, everyone's on the same side here. But this was a speech for two audiences - the lofty collection of world leaders in the hall itself, and her party back home in Britain. At home lies a potential hurdle. Her pledge to ""respect"" the rules of the European Court of Justice won't go down well with Brexiteers. If May wants Britain to remain a within Europol or a stay part of the European Arrest Warrant, then it's hard to see how she can negotiate that and not be in some part under the jurisdiction of the ECJ. That's a battle she'll have to win another day. Today, May's speech did nothing to win Europe round to Brexit. It did little to convince the international sceptics that Britain isn't in retreat. But it did get a gentle nod of approval from Brussels. She'll take that."

Thousands of people enjoyed street parties when the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were married seven years ago, with Britons enjoying an extra Bank Holiday. While no extra day off work has been granted for the latest Royal nuptials, plenty are still expected to celebrate on what is the same Saturday as the FA Cup final. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said it hoped councils would make it as easy as possible for parties to be held. ""Many councils, from Bromley to Salford, have already announced that they are waiving charges for street party road closures, making it easier and cheaper than ever to hold celebrations,"" the department said. ""The Government is urging other councils to follow suit."" Fans of both the Royals and the beautiful game were relieved to discover that the wedding will not clash with the Cup Final - with the service starting at midday and kick-off at Wembley at 5.30pm. Jake Berry MP, the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State, said: ""We've made it easier than ever for local residents from all backgrounds to come together to celebrate the Royal Wedding and we hope councils will get into the spirit by helping people wishing to organise street parties."" The Street Party Site, which advises people on good practices for organising such events, says that one resident on behalf of their road will need to apply to their council three to 12 weeks in advance. Every house and business in the street will need to be informed of the plan, and emergency services will need to be consulted to ensure access to the road is not compromised."

A spokesman for Aseman Airlines originally said that there were 66 people on board, but state media later reported that one passenger had actually missed the flight, bringing the likely death toll to 65. The 24-year-old ATR-72, a twin-engine turboprop, left the Iranian capital Tehran at around 8am local time and crashed about an hour later. The plane went down near the remote mountain town of Semirom, about 390 miles south of Tehran. It had been heading to the southern city of Yasuj, in Isfahan province. Aseman Airlines spokesman Mohammad Taghi Tabatabai said one child was among the passengers. He added: ""After searches in the area, unfortunately we were informed that the plane crashed. ""Unfortunately, all our dear ones lost their lives in this incident."" Later, however, he reportedly told ISNA news agency: ""Given the special circumstances of the region, we still have no access to the spot of the crash and therefore we cannot accurately and definitely confirm the death of all passengers of this plane."" The plane is thought to have crashed into Mount Dena, a sub-range of the Zagros Mountains. According to Mehr News Agency, it appeared to have been attempting an emergency landing. State TV said nobody had yet managed to reach the scene. Fog is preventing helicopters from getting there and Iran's Red Crescent has deployed workers on foot. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in a statement: ""The very tragic incident of a passenger plane crashing on Tehran-Yasuj route, which led to the death of a number of our fellow Iranians, caused great grief and sorrow.

The carrier, Iran's third largest, has 29 planes, including six ATR-72 aircraft, according to plane-tracking website FlightRadar24. Iran's commercial air fleet has suffered during decades of international sanctions that have made it difficult to buy newer aircraft, with planes being involved in a number of accidents. Aviation analyst Alex Macheras told Sky News: ""Flying an older plane in Europe, the West, Asia, is very very safe because we have excellent maintenance. ""But in Iran, flying an older aircraft is increasing the risk, because they simply do not have access to the spare parts - because of these sanctions - to require and carry out the necessary maintenance."" After the landmark 2015 nuclear agreement loosened the restrictions, the country signed deals to buy dozens of new passenger planes, including a $536m (£382m) deal with ATR last April for at least 20 aircraft."

The ship was forced to make an emergency stop at the New South Wales town of Eden so that six men and three teenage boys could be removed. Another 14 passengers, including women and children, also left the ship, police said. The 23 are believed to be members of the same family. The ship and its remaining passengers eventually docked in Melbourne on Saturday. Passengers said the ship's security staff had been heavy-handed while trying to contain the brawl and had made the situation worse. Passenger Michael Haddara told The Age: ""They put handcuffs around their hands as knuckle dusters. ""They were punching women, 16-year-old kids, everything. ""They called up the mechanical people from down the bottom, the big boys, to intimidate and basically do what they want.""

2018-02-18,"Henry Bolton became leader 142 days ago. And for 142 days in the sun, he has lost, more or less everything.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180219035620/https://news.sky.com/story/whither-ousted-ukip-leader-henry-bolton-11255778,"He has lost his wife, his family, his day job and today he lost the leadership of the party which had thrust him into the spotlight. When he became leader, 142 days ago, I was in the hall in Torquay. I remember that he was elected on a promise to professionalise the party. When I asked him, a few days ago, how that was going, he could only wince. Instead of professionalisation, his leadership has seen the party sink to new lows of infighting and humiliation. After the revelations of his mistress Jo Marney's racism, he received a unanimous vote of no confidence in his leadership from the party's National Executive Committee. Since then he has experienced the undoing of his private life and intense media scrutiny, which he compared to me as akin to that endured by Princess Diana. He hoped he could survive. Going into the make or break meeting, I was told that he had good reason to be hopeful. Nigel Farage had backed him; he had coachloads of supporters being brought in and he had apparently re-geared the race into a referendum on the unpopular NEC. Yet in the end, it wasn't even close. What happened? The media were banned from the meeting itself but sources who were inside tell me that to some extent, Mr Bolton lost it on the day. He made a bellicose speech which barely mentioned the allegations against him. He appeared ""arrogant"" and ""without contrition"". He launched a blistering attack on the NEC which he slammed as: ""The enemy within. The only loyalty these people have is to themselves. Their actions are despicable."" Mr Bolton's opponents were equally unforgiving. Sources tell me that Steve Crowther, former acting leader, speaking on behalf of the NEC, was scathing, ""going hard on Bolton lying to his family and wife"". Mr Crowther said: ""It is not that he has done wrong but that he refuses to accept that he has done wrong. ""It is not about the morality of what he has done but his political judgement. He has developed a reputation for being unreachable and always late. He is also a liar."" He then accused Mr Bolton of telling untruths about his CV. Up to then the forces seemed evenly balanced, with both sides being booed and heckled. The game-changer came when Paul Oakden, chairman of the party, addressed the crowd and revealed that Mr Bolton had only days before threatened to try and stop the Emergency General Meeting with legal action. In his right of reply, Mr Bolton did not deny this but indeed threatened it again. This did not go down well with the undecided voters. Threatening to sue your own party is not a good look. At that moment a source texted me: ""He's a goner."" The meeting was bitter and nasty but the rebels succeeded and Mr Bolton is gone. But for how much longer? On Thursday, Mr Bolton confirmed to me that he ""had three options"" if he lost. Today he confirmed to me that he was considering running for leader again. He said: ""You can't keep a good man down. You certainly haven't heard the last of me in politics."" He might well run again, there is nothing to prohibit him from doing so under the party's rules. He received 37% of the no-confidence vote. Under the UKIP's First Past the Post electoral system, he need not get a majority of the votes in a leadership contest, just one more than the second placed candidate. Talking to those in the hall, he clearly has supporters who would rally to his cause again. Senior UKIP figures are disparaging of the prospect. Welsh leader Neil Hamilton told me ""that he might well run, as he's shown he's no stranger to humiliation"". Gerard Batten, the interim leader, said that if he is thinking about it Mr Bolton should ""get a life"". But as a senior UKIP source told me: ""He might well do it, because he's lost everything else."" He is chasing the dying of the light. Whatever happens to Mr Bolton, his is a sorry tale but UKIP's story could be sorrier still. It is now on its seventh leader in 18 months. It faces the prospect of another leadership election which it cannot afford. It heads into a set of local elections where it is defending hundreds of seats, with no permanent leader. There are even rumours that its great hero Mr Farage - his spell over the apparently party broken - might set up a new party with former donor Aaron Banks. One woman will be relieved: Theresa May. The hardest proponents of the hardest Brexit are off the battlefield. That gives her breathing space on her Eurosceptic flank. In the end, UKIP have simply lost their reason to be. Like Del Boy after he finally became a millionaire, now their lifetime ambition of Brexit has been achieved, they just do not quite know quite what to do with themselves. The sticking plaster, which bound this disparate band of libertarians, social conservatives, economic protectionists, working class socialists and shire Tories together, has been ripped off. There's not much left. UKIP have been written off before. But in Birmingham, the stench of death is everywhere. As one source texted me as we all headed for home: ""Dead within a year, I reckon."""
2018-02-18,Rural communities with little or no wireless internet are getting an unlikely boost from churches hosting satellite dishes.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180219035620/https://news.sky.com/story/how-church-steeples-boost-wifi-connectivity-in-rural-communities-11255800,"St Giles Church in rural Essex is what you might expect of a 15th Century parish church. The stone building is on a small hill surrounded by acres of green valleys, farms and a smattering of houses. It is right in the middle of the village of Great Maplestead. But look closely and you will spot this medieval church has some very modern additions. Perched atop the church tower is a small satellite dish and four telecoms transmitters that provide high-speed broadband to around 120 local households, which previously had no or limited coverage. The antenna was installed two years ago by a broadband operator that specialises in connecting rural communities to the internet. The church is paid rent for hosting the kit, which has been carefully designed and camouflaged so as not mar the aesthetic of the ancient building. ""Some people were worried that we were going to damage the church,"" vicar Revd Gay Ellis told Sky News. ""Or that it would look out of place, or is it right for us as a Church to be doing this sort of thing? ""But the more we got involved in it, and the more people understood about it, they realised that this was really part of the Church's mission. This was a type of ministry."" The Government has recognised the role that rural parish churches can play in improving internet and mobile connectivity. Some 65% of Anglican churches and 66% of parishes in England are in rural areas and their central village locations and tall spires mean they are often well placed to address connectivity and coverage problems. A new accord between the Government and the Church of England hopes to streamline the process of mobile and broadband operators getting the equipment installed. The agreement is designed to cut down on bureaucracy and red-tape and make it easier for individual parishes to make their own decisions over the installation. There is clear guidance to ensure the telecoms infrastructure does not impact on the character and architectural or historic significance of the church building. Matt Hancock, Minister for Digital, Media, Culture and Sport, said: ""This agreement with the Church of England will mean that even a 15th Century building can help make Britain fit for the future, improving people’s lives by boosting connectivity in some of our hardest-to-reach areas."" At present, around 5% of UK households do not have access to superfast broadband, and 10% of the UK does not have reliable mobile phone coverage. That was the case in Great Maplestead. But the introduction of the antenna on the church tower now means local residents now have access to internet speeds of up to 40MB/s for both upload and download. ""It was almost life-saving, certainly business saving,"" a local resident told Sky News. ""I'm a photographer and need to send pictures to London and get instructions from London via email. It used to take 25 to 30 minutes to download a simple PDF so this was really vital for us."""
2018-02-18,A plucky cow that was being taken to an abattoir in Poland managed to escape after swimming to safety on an island.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180219035620/https://news.sky.com/story/hero-cow-escapes-abattoir-in-poland-by-swimming-to-island-11255824,"Keen to keep her life the bovine made a run for it as slaughterhouse workers tried to load her on to a lorry at the farm she was raised on. Having ignored advice she would need to be tranquilised the workers were then sent running after the escaped animal, Polish news show Wiadomosci reported. A farmworker suffered broken and bruised ribs after the cow rammed a metal fence during her escape. She then ran into the nearby Lake Nysa in south Poland close to the border with the Czech Republic and appeared to dive underwater, before swimming over to an island, which has become her new home. The farmer, known only as Mr Lukasz, tried for a week to get the cow back but has given up and is now caring for her on the island, where he makes sure she has enough food. He eventually called the fire brigade to help him shift the stubborn cow but when firefighters approached her by boat she swam about 50 metres to a peninsula. Pawel Gotowski, deputy commander of the Nysa fire brigade, said they could not get closer than 70 metres to the cow because she was so scared. The farmer said he does not want to put the cow down as he can still make money by selling her. Her story has captured the nation, with local politician and former singer Pawel Kukiz offering to save the ""hero cow"" from her death. He said: ""If all citizens could show such determination as this cow then Poland would be a much more prosperous country. ""I am not a vegetarian, but fortitude and the will to fight for this cow's life is invaluable. ""Therefore, I have decided to do everything to get the cow delivered to a safe place and, as a reward for her attitude, guarantee her a long-term retirement and natural death."" A local zoo said it would happily take the cow but it unable to do so because European Union rules state zoos can only house ""approved"" animals. Most cows are good swimmers, but if they grow tired they do not head for dry land and instead stop swimming and drown."

Mr Bolton - who told Sky News he was ""quietly confident"" ahead of the meeting - had been clinging on to the leadership after a revolt by several senior party figures over his relationship with model Jo Marney. He admitted he still had ""strong affections"" for the 25-year-old, who resigned from the party following allegations she had sent racist text messages about Prince Harry's fiancee Meghan Markle. Despite losing the motion, Mr Bolton is still eligible to stand again in the forthcoming leadership contest, which will be held within the next 90 days. When asked by Sky News whether he would run, Mr Bolton said: ""I don't know yet. I've just spoken to my team, we've had a quick batting around of the different options. I'm not ruling out any option at the moment."" He said he was ""slightly disappointed"" to have lost the no confidence vote, but that he was ""not finished with politics"".

He added that Mr Bolton would be ""exceptionally foolish"" to even remain a party member, and predicted a ""swathe of members coming back to UKIP"" as a result of his departure.

""We matter now more than we ever have,"" he said. :: Top UKIP figures quit :: Farage: UKIP could be 'worthless' in 18 months Mr Bolton had received the backing of Nigel Farage before the vote, with the former leader fearing another leadership contest would risk the party's ""self-destruction"". Writing in the Daily Telegraph on Friday, Mr Farage said: ""I believe it would be better to allow Mr Bolton, with all his faults, the chance to turn UKIP into an electoral machine again.

If the instructors are found to pose a high risk to learners then they could be removed from the Approved Driving Instructor register (ADI). There are around 39,000 driving instructors in Britain and all of them undergo enhanced criminal record checks that must be renewed every four years. But the DVSA said that, between April 2016 and March 2017, there were 109 investigations into misconduct, which included inappropriate sexual behaviour. The agency said this included driving instructors using sexualised language, unnecessary physical contact, making inappropriate contact with pupils and sending indecent messages or images to pupils. Head of counter-fraud and investigations at the DVSA, Andy Rice, said: ""We take the safety of learner drivers extremely seriously and will thoroughly investigate any complaints about the conduct of instructors, and will involve the police where necessary. ""Any driving instructors threatening the safety of learner drivers and failing to meet the 'fit and proper' criteria will be removed from the ADI register."""

Responding to allegations reported by the Mail on Sunday, Mr Cox admitted that some of his conduct towards women during his time with Save the Children would have made them feel ""uncomfortable"". The father-of-two said he would ""take full responsibility"" for his actions during his time with Save the Children and has stood down from his roles at The Jo Cox Foundation and More In Common, which he helped set up. The Mail on Sunday reports that in the year before his wife was fatally shot and stabbed by a far-right terrorist during the Brexit referendum campaign in June 2016, Mr Cox sexually harassed a Save the Children worker outside a bar in London. The 39-year-old acknowledged he ""made mistakes"" before leaving the charity, but he claimed the allegations against him were a ""massive exaggeration"". He denied a further allegation in the newspaper that he forced himself on a woman during a trip to Harvard University. ""I want to apologise deeply and unreservedly for my past behaviour and for the hurt and offence that I have caused,"" he said. ""In the aftermath of Jo's murder, I promised that I would dedicate my life to two things, firstly loving and protecting our children and secondly fighting the hatred that killed Jo. ""In the last few days allegations from several years ago have resurfaced that makes concentrating on both of those tasks much more difficult. For that reason, while away over half-term, I decided to step down from my current public roles for the time being."" Mr Cox continued: ""While I do not accept the allegations contained in the 2015 complaint to the police in Cambridge, Massachusetts, I do acknowledge and understand that during my time at Save the Children I made mistakes and behaved in a way that caused some women hurt and offence. ""This was never malicious but it was certainly inappropriate. ""In the past I have focused on disputing what I felt was untrue in the allegations, but I realise now that it's more important to take full responsibility for what I have done. ""I am committed to holding myself to much higher standards of personal conduct in the future."" His resignation from The Jo Cox Foundation was accepted by its board, who said they admired the ""integrity, commitment and dedication"" he showed to create a ""positive legacy"" for his wife, who he married in 2009. A colleague at the Jo Cox Foundation told Sky News: ""The person described in these allegations is not the Brendan we know. ""Brendan is a very responsible guy, which is why he has decided to stand down. ""People have looked up to him and while we are all upset to read some of the stuff that has been printed, those people need to know that they are right to admire him for everything he has said and done since Jo's death."""

2018-02-18,"The Prime Minister is set to admit students in England face one of ""most expensive systems of university tuition in the world"" as she announces a wide-ranging review of funding for further and higher education.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180219035620/https://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-to-announce-review-into-university-tuition-fees-and-education-funding-11257161,"In a speech on Monday afternoon, Theresa May will say the system of variable tuition fees for university degrees has failed to create the ""competitive market"" originally envisaged. Mrs May is expected to challenge the ""outdated attitude"" towards technical qualifications, saying many graduates with academic degrees end up questioning their value relative to the size of the debt accrued and the high interest rates on repayments. ""We now have one of the most expensive systems of university tuition in the world,"" she will say in a speech in Derbyshire ""All but a handful of universities charge the maximum possible fees for undergraduate courses. ""Three-year courses remain the norm. And the level of fees charged do not relate to the cost or quality of the course. ""The competitive market between universities which the system of variable tuition fees envisaged has simply not emerged."" An independent chair and panel will support the review as it considers all aspects of post-18 education funding, including whether or not maintenance grants to help with living costs should be reintroduced for the poorest students. It is also expected to consider how career guidance could be improved to give young people clearer information about future earning potential in certain careers, and what qualifications those careers require. The review is scheduled to return its findings in early 2019. Labour's pledge to scrap tuition fees altogether became one of the key issues for young voters at the last election. Since then the Government have pledged to freeze the top rate of tuition fees at £9,250, scrapping a proposed increase, but some Conservative MPs want the party to go further. On Sunday, Education Secretary Damian Hinds defended the role of tuition fees in dividing the cost of university education between the taxpayer and the student, but said variable fees should reflect the value of the degree. ""What we need to look at is the different aspects of pricing, so the cost to put on the course, the value it is to the student and also the value to our society as a whole and to our economy for the future,"" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr. However, former education secretary Justine Greening has warned the Government's review will likely be challenging, given the complexity of defining what constitutes a ""beneficial"" degree. Mrs Greening also suggested forcing universities to charge less for degrees considered to offer lower potential earnings could remove the incentive for poorer students to pursue higher-earning careers. Universities have also cautioned against any move to reduce fees without alternative funding being put in place. ""Future success depends on universities having stable and sustainable funding - which the current system provides,"" said Professor Dame Janet Beer, president of Universities UK and vice chancellor of the University of Liverpool. ""This review is the opportunity to examine the evidence and to make improvements. ""Crucially, the current system could be better understood and feel fairer to students. Injecting new investment to help the poorest students with their living costs and tackling the decline in mature and part-time study must be priorities."""

The quake happened just after 2.30pm on Saturday. A spokesperson told Sky News it was ""reasonably-sized"" and that the effects had been felt as far afield as Devon and Birmingham. ""This is the largest earthquake in mainland UK since the 5.2 magnitude Market Rasen earthquake in 2008,"" he said.

But away from the glitz and red carpet, there are some profound questions facing the film business, which has developed into one of the most rapidly growing sectors of the British economy. Its growth has been supported by a group of factors. For one thing, successive governments have maintained tax incentives to encourage companies to make films in Britain. For another, some huge blockbuster series have made their homes in the UK - James Bond, Harry Potter and now Star Wars. Their presence has helped to encourage the growth of a skilled workforce and cutting-edge technology. There's the advantage of the English language, a great attraction for many American production companies, as well as easy access to many specialist support services - London, for instance, plays home to some of the world's greatest visual effects businesses. Put that altogether and you get an industry that has stormed away from its doldrums of 30 years ago and is now thriving. Indeed, Pinewood Studios will shortly open another new sound stage, the latest installment of a £200m investment programme. Adrian Wootton is the chief executive of the British Film Commission, an industry veteran and a man who think British movie-making has never had it so good. He told me: ""We could easily over the next five to 10 years double the size of the revenues generated for UK plc. ""We're already a $3bn-a-year business - bigger than pharmaceuticals now in the UK in terms of employment and the revenues we generate. We have a lot of potential still to exploit."" But there are challenges and, like just about every other business, the movie industry is having to work out how to handle Brexit. In the short term, few doubt it's been a boost - so much revenue comes from America that the devaluation of the pound helped increase revenue overnight. But there are also fears over what Brexit will mean for the industry's small army of skilled foreign workers. Few sectors of the economy require such a global outlook as the movie business, where actors, directors, producers and technical skill move around the world. It's not just the business leaders who fret. Actor and director Andy Serkis told Sky News: ""I feel like that we're going to lose out so much on cultural exchange and this is a huge part of that. ""People from all over the world can work here, not only Europe but particularly Europe. What we have to offer, in the way that the film industry creates other industries around it - I hope that is not damaged."" Sir William Sargent is the chief executive and founder of Framestore, one of the world's foremost visual effects companies. He has led his team to Oscars, BAFTAs and Emmy awards, and says his workforce includes people from every country in the European Union. ""We need access to talented foreign people to help grow the business,"" he tells me. ""We simply cannot get enough British people with the right talents - British universities don't generate enough students with the rights skills for us. So I worry that Brexit might restrict my ability to access that talent to work in London."" Sir William predicts that his businesses in other parts of the world, including China, Canada and America, will grow quicker than his British business in the years to come. But he says there is still a huge opportunity for the UK industry - as long as it is bold and ambitious in searching out new customers. ""In Europe and America we have less than one billion consumers who consume what we do; in Asia, between India and China, and all the countries around them, there are about four billion. ""That is the scale of the prize and that is the scale of the positioning that we have the opportunity for in the UK. ""And if we do not do it in the next five or 10 years, then we will only have ourselves to blame."""

British writer-director Martin McDonagh, whose film Three Billboards took home five awards, said he felt the film's theme - an angry woman deciding to act - was appropriate to the mood of the time. As the winner of best film, he said: ""As we've seen this year, sometimes anger is the only way to get people to listen and to change."" Gary Oldman took home the best actor award for his portrayal of Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour, making him a favourite to bag an Oscar in March. Many of Britain's female stars - including Academy Award winner Emma Thompson, Emma Watson and Gemma Arterton - also signed an open letter ahead of the awards demanding an end to sexual harassment. More than 190 entertainers, academics and activists have added their signatures, giving their voice to the protests over sexual harassment which have been growing since allegations against American film producer Harvey Weinstein surfaced last October. What did the Bafta stars tell Sky News about Times Up and #MeToo: Frances McDormand, best actress Mcdormand, who wore a red and black dress, said: ""I have a little trouble with compliance but I stand in full solidarity with my sisters wearing black. ""I appreciate a well organised act of disobedience... Let it (this film) be a part of the positive public discourse that is happening... ""Not only are they entertaining they encourage a longer and broader conversation... when I was a young actor in drama School I was told that I was not gifted and I'd have to work for it, so I did... Power to the people."" Salma Hayek Hayek, who told Sky News she was abused psychologically as well as physically, said: ""I've been an activist for women's rights for 20 years."" Saoirse Ronan, best actress nominee ""It feels like an important time."" Sam Rockwell, best supporting actor ""I stood on the shoulders of 'strong, intelligent, righteous women'."" Kristin Scott Thomas, supporting actress nominee Scott Thomas said she is pleased by the conversation the entertainment industry is having about misconduct, but thinks a tougher task will be ""moving it from conversation to action"". Andrea Riseborough Riseborough said the film industry sorely needs greater diversity, adding: ""It's more likely we'll see an alien onscreen than we'll see an Asian woman at the moment, which is disgraceful."""
2018-02-19,"Henry Bolton became leader 142 days ago. And for 142 days in the sun, he has lost, more or less everything.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180220043057/https://news.sky.com/story/whither-ousted-ukip-leader-henry-bolton-11255778,"He has lost his wife, his family, his day job and today he lost the leadership of the party which had thrust him into the spotlight. When he became leader, 142 days ago, I was in the hall in Torquay. I remember that he was elected on a promise to professionalise the party. When I asked him, a few days ago, how that was going, he could only wince. Instead of professionalisation, his leadership has seen the party sink to new lows of infighting and humiliation. After the revelations of his mistress Jo Marney's racism, he received a unanimous vote of no confidence in his leadership from the party's National Executive Committee. Since then he has experienced the undoing of his private life and intense media scrutiny, which he compared to me as akin to that endured by Princess Diana. He hoped he could survive. Going into the make or break meeting, I was told that he had good reason to be hopeful. Nigel Farage had backed him; he had coachloads of supporters being brought in and he had apparently re-geared the race into a referendum on the unpopular NEC. Yet in the end, it wasn't even close. What happened? The media were banned from the meeting itself but sources who were inside tell me that to some extent, Mr Bolton lost it on the day. He made a bellicose speech which barely mentioned the allegations against him. He appeared ""arrogant"" and ""without contrition"". He launched a blistering attack on the NEC which he slammed as: ""The enemy within. The only loyalty these people have is to themselves. Their actions are despicable."" Mr Bolton's opponents were equally unforgiving. Sources tell me that Steve Crowther, former acting leader, speaking on behalf of the NEC, was scathing, ""going hard on Bolton lying to his family and wife"". Mr Crowther said: ""It is not that he has done wrong but that he refuses to accept that he has done wrong. ""It is not about the morality of what he has done but his political judgement. He has developed a reputation for being unreachable and always late. He is also a liar."" He then accused Mr Bolton of telling untruths about his CV. Up to then the forces seemed evenly balanced, with both sides being booed and heckled. The game-changer came when Paul Oakley, general-secretary of the party, addressed the crowd and revealed that Mr Bolton had only days before threatened to try and stop the Emergency General Meeting with legal action. In his right of reply, Mr Bolton did not deny this but indeed threatened it again. This did not go down well with the undecided voters. Threatening to sue your own party is not a good look. At that moment a source texted me: ""He's a goner."" The meeting was bitter and nasty but the rebels succeeded and Mr Bolton is gone. But for how much longer? On Thursday, Mr Bolton confirmed to me that he ""had three options"" if he lost. Today he confirmed to me that he was considering running for leader again. He said: ""You can't keep a good man down. You certainly haven't heard the last of me in politics."" He might well run again, there is nothing to prohibit him from doing so under the party's rules. He received 37% of the no-confidence vote. Under the UKIP's First Past the Post electoral system, he need not get a majority of the votes in a leadership contest, just one more than the second placed candidate. Talking to those in the hall, he clearly has supporters who would rally to his cause again. Senior UKIP figures are disparaging of the prospect. Welsh leader Neil Hamilton told me ""that he might well run, as he's shown he's no stranger to humiliation"". Gerard Batten, the interim leader, said that if he is thinking about it Mr Bolton should ""get a life"". But as a senior UKIP source told me: ""He might well do it, because he's lost everything else."" He is chasing the dying of the light. Whatever happens to Mr Bolton, his is a sorry tale but UKIP's story could be sorrier still. It is now on its seventh leader in 18 months. It faces the prospect of another leadership election which it cannot afford. It heads into a set of local elections where it is defending hundreds of seats, with no permanent leader. There are even rumours that its great hero Mr Farage - his spell over the apparently party broken - might set up a new party with former donor Aaron Banks. One woman will be relieved: Theresa May. The hardest proponents of the hardest Brexit are off the battlefield. That gives her breathing space on her Eurosceptic flank. In the end, UKIP have simply lost their reason to be. Like Del Boy after he finally became a millionaire, now their lifetime ambition of Brexit has been achieved, they just do not quite know quite what to do with themselves. The sticking plaster, which bound this disparate band of libertarians, social conservatives, economic protectionists, working class socialists and shire Tories together, has been ripped off. There's not much left. UKIP have been written off before. But in Birmingham, the stench of death is everywhere. As one source texted me as we all headed for home: ""Dead within a year, I reckon."""
2018-02-19,Uber has accepted new proposals to enforce English language standards on its drivers in London by withdrawing a legal challenge.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180220043057/https://news.sky.com/story/uber-drops-appeal-over-english-tests-for-london-drivers-11258011,"The ride-hailing app went to court after Transport for London (TfL) said all applicants for a private hire driver's licence in the capital from October 2016 should have to prove their ability to communicate in English and take tests in basic writing and reading. Officials argued the changes would ensure passenger safety, but Uber claimed the standard required was too high and would lead to ""indirect racial discrimination"" that could threaten the livelihoods of 30,000 drivers. The company lost the first round of its legal case last year and then, in September, TfL refused Uber's bid to renew its operating licence on the grounds it was not a ""fit and proper"" operator. Uber has since been working to bolster its standards - announcing last week that it was to introduce new safety measures nationwide. It said on Monday that its decision to drop an appeal against the language tests - due to be heard on Tuesday - was a response to a change in TfL's plans for the tests. TfL said last week: ""Since 14 October 2016, all applicants for a private hire driver's licence have been required to be able to communicate in English to a B1 standard. ""We are now looking at introducing an English language test which is more relevant to the role of a private hire driver but remains at B1 standard. ""For example, including bespoke material with language and vocabulary that directly relates to the role and responsibilities of a private hire driver."" Commenting on the decision, an Uber spokesperson responded: ""This is a welcome announcement from Transport for London. ""We support raising standards and believe that a new test focused on situations drivers may encounter makes a lot more sense. This means we will no longer pursue our legal appeal."" TfL said: ""We believe that the ability to communicate in English at an appropriate level is a crucial element of the high standards of passenger safety and service Londoners and visitors to the city deserve. ""We are pleased that the appeal has been withdrawn and will work to introduce a new test that is more relevant to the role of a private hire driver. ""It would require applicants to demonstrate the appropriate level of English at the same level as the existing test but would include language and vocabulary that directly relates to a private hire driver's role and responsibilities."" Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: ""I welcome the decision by Uber to withdraw their appeal against the English language tests. ""I want the highest standards of passenger safety and service in London from private hire drivers and that's why I've always said that if you want to drive passengers in London you should be able to communicate in English at an appropriate level."""
2018-02-19,"Children as young as 10 have fallen victim to ""upskirting"" - the act of taking photographs under dresses without consent - according to new figures.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180220043057/https://news.sky.com/story/call-for-upskirting-law-to-protect-women-from-horrific-crime-11258244,"Campaigners are calling for urgent changes to criminalise the act, as there is no current law banning it. In some cases, victims have had to pursue claims of voyeurism or indecency instead. Victims, politicians and campaign groups have called on the Government to implement ""an effective criminal law"". The campaign for legislation follows the movement for clearer laws on image-based sex abuse - or revenge porn - which saw legislation come in to force in 2015 in response to a legal grey area. The first official figures come from a freedom of information request detailing upskirting incidents, which highlights many of the issues facing officers dealing with reports. Fifteen of the 44 police forces included had records of upskirting allegations in the past two years, while 14 said there were no records and 15 did not respond. Forces with data showed 78 reports in two years, with 11 of those resulting in suspects being charged. The true scale of the problem is likely to be much bigger, according to campaigners, who say police face difficulties being able to log and investigate cases. There was insufficient evidence to prosecute in several cases, including one involving a 10-year-old girl in 2015, according to Avon and Somerset Police. Clare McGlynn, professor of law at Durham University and also an expert on sexual violence, said: ""The Government's continuing failure to provide an effective criminal law against upskirting breaches women's human rights. ""We are entitled to protection from degrading and abusive treatment, whether offline or online - and we are entitled to have our privacy in public respected. ""We are also entitled to a law that is fit for purpose, a law that treats this abuse as a form of sexual offence and that provides anonymity to all complainants. Only then will victims feel more willing to come forward and report to the police and support prosecutions."" Conservative MP Maria Miller, who chairs the Women and Equalities Select Committee, said it was ""concerning"" that police might feel they do not have adequate powers to tackle the ""horrific crime"". ""Sometimes the law isn't straightforward in its application and new laws can help,"" she said. ""In the case of revenge pornography there are now more than 500 cases prosecuted a year."" Sarah Green, of the End Violence Against Women coalition, said the figures showed police were ""clearly struggling to recognise upskirting distinctly"". Campaigner Gina Martin told Sky News last year: ""Every woman I know has experienced sexual harassment on some level. I'm bored of women's bodies being public properties."""
2018-02-19,A police officer has appeared at a disciplinary hearing after he was accused of taking a colleague's tin of biscuits and lying about it.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180220043057/https://news.sky.com/story/police-officer-accused-of-taking-the-biscuits-11258330,"PC Thomas Hooper, a Metropolitan Police Constable attached to the Kingston unit, is said to have taken a two-tier tin of biscuits from a communal area, and then given a false account, on 7 May, 2016. But the officer claims he intended to share the sweet treat, and offered to replace them. Charles Apthrop, representing the Met Police at the tribunal, said the matter related to whether or not he had breached professional standards. Mr Apthrop said: ""The appropriate authority's perspective is that it is not the value of what was taken, it is what was done. ""It shows clear evidence of misappropriation of property. The officer was aware it belonged to someone else and the officer has taken it."" He added that by taking the biscuits, PC Hooper showed a ""fundamental lack of integrity"". Panel chairman Naheed Asjad asked then inspector Sarah Blake: ""You have a sergeant and an inspector and a box of biscuits that have gone missing and the only thing you can come up with is to refer the matter to DPS (Directorate of Professional Standards)?"" She said that ""the option of going to the DPS was because of the gravity of the incident"". Answering the point that the offer was made to replace the biscuits, Ms Blake said: ""By that time the biscuits had been eaten and, in my mind, theft is theft. ""How was he going to put the biscuits back?"" PC Hooper denies two allegations of breaching professional standards. He is also accused of applying to have a fixed penalty notice cancelled, when he triggered a speed camera, as he travelled at 51mph in a 30mph zone. PC Hooper was driving the transit van in response mode, but is said to have no reason to have done so. He claims he was transporting a male patient from a mental health unit to the station in Kingston, south west London, when the air conditioning stopped working. He said it was a health hazard because the patient had already been sick. He is accused of lying about both the biscuit and the driving incident. Inspector Mark Bullen spoke to PC Hooper after the incident and told the hearing: ""My assumption was that the biscuits had been part of the tea club. I remember quite clearly telling him that this could be construed as theft and worst-case scenario as discreditable conduct."" Mr Bullen said there had been no reason for the manner in which PC Hooper drove in the second incident. He added that PC Hooper could have cleaned the vehicle and placed it out of service instead of driven it ""aggressively"" back to the station. The hearing will continue on Tuesday."
2018-02-19,"The Dutch Government has linked its decision to activate what it refers to as a ""hard Brexit"" plan for customs to ""divisions within the British Conservative Party"" and a ""remaining lack of clarity"" from Britain that is ""impeding negotiations"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180220043057/https://news.sky.com/story/dutch-activate-hard-brexit-plan-and-blame-a-lack-of-clarity-from-the-uk-11258568,"A letter seen by Sky News sent last week from its Finance Ministry sought to explain to Dutch parliamentarians exactly how many extra customs officers would be required to police new trade barriers at Europe's biggest port in Rotterdam and Dutch airports. Cabinet minister Menno Snel wrote that 930 would be required in the event of No Deal which is ""conceivable"" after ""difficult"" first phase negotiations. Perhaps as shocking is that 750 customs agents would be required even in the event of a Canada-style free trade deal with a transition period. Fifty have already been paid for. As the finance ministry calculates it takes between nine and 22 months to train a customs officer, the Dutch Government has green-lighted immediate recruiting, training, tendering of contracts and organising of housing. Finance minister Snel wrote to Dutch MPs: ""The divisions within the British Conservative Party and the remaining lack of clarity about the British input continue to impede the smooth running of the negotiations. ""It is therefore clear that the scenario that the UK leaves the EU on 29 March 2019 without a withdrawal agreement and without a transitional period is still conceivable. ""The red lines of the UK for the future relationship with the EU (leaving the internal market and customs union) mean that the trade relationship can not go much further than a trade agreement like the one the EU has concluded with Canada."" The Netherlands has traditionally been seen as a key ally of the UK, and stands to be among the most impacted by any radical change to UK-EU trading conditions, as when imports and exports are combined it is the UK's third largest trade partner. On Wednesday the PM is hosting Dutch PM Mark Rutte at Downing Street as part of her charm offensive to secure agreement for an implementation phase at the full EU Council next month. The Brexit ""war cabinet"" will try to thrash out a common position on future trade arrangements at an away day at Chequers on Thursday. Dutch politicians, including Pieter Omtzigt, the Parliament's Brexit rapporteur has said his country is only ""preparing for the stated policy of the UK government - the UK outside the customs union"", and that ""if we need hundreds of new customs and agricultural inspectors the British are going to need thousands."" The preparations being made across the North Sea come at a time when the Brexit Secretary will implore Europe to recognise existing levels of trust in UK-EU relations that he argues will enable a more ambitious free trade agreement after Brexit. David Davis will argue that the European Union can trust the UK not to engage in a ""Mad Max dystopian"" race to the bottom on standards. He will declare that leaving the EU will instead create a ""race to the top in global standards"". Speaking in Vienna, Austria, as part of a series of speeches designed as a PR blitz on Brexit, he is set to say the concerns are ""borrowed from dystopian fiction"". He will present the Government's view as part of a case for a Free Trade Agreement with the EU after Brexit day - saying he is ""certain"" a good deal can be achieved."

A statement from Will's family said: ""He was an intelligent, high grade achiever who aspired to be an airline pilot. ""He was a talented footballer and idealised Chelsea FC. He was often found kicking a ball about on our village green and played locally for Horsham Sparrows."" His family admitted they were ""struggling to come to terms"" with the loss. They said his death ""has left an immense hole in our world, which can never be filled. We are utterly devastated by this tragic accident that has robbed us of our gorgeous, lovable and cheeky son"". A friend said Will's younger brother, Henry, had been due to go with the pair to watch his sibling play football, but decided not to go. The statement described Mr Hearnshaw as a ""devoted"" husband, father and grandfather, who dedicated himself to charity work after retiring as a headmaster. He was a man who ""loved his family dearly and also gave so much to so many people. He devoted his life to improving the lives of so many through his work and before his retirement he fulfilled his dream of becoming headmaster,"" it said. ""He carried on working in education after his retirement, helping a number of schools to improve,"" it added. Detectives investigating the collision have confirmed a 72-year-old man and a 15-year-old boy died after a train struck their car and that their family is being supported by family liaison officers. Detective Inspector Brett Walker from British Transport Police said: ""This is an extremely tragic incident and our thoughts are with the family at this difficult time."""
2018-02-19,Theresa May hit out at Labour's pledge to abolish university tuition fees as she unveiled a wide-ranging review of post-18 education.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180220043057/https://news.sky.com/story/may-says-abolishing-tuition-fees-not-the-answer-as-review-into-post-18-education-launched-11258080,"The Prime Minister said such a move would push up taxes, leave universities competing with the likes of schools and the NHS for cash and result in a cap on student numbers being reintroduced. ""That is not my idea of a fair or progressive system,"" Mrs May said at a speech from a college in Derby. She added that it was her belief ""those who benefit directly from higher education should contribute directly towards the cost of it"". Mrs May also admitted her predecessor David Cameron's decision to treble tuition fees to up to £9,000 a year had failed to create a ""competitive market"" in higher education. ""All but a handful of universities charge the maximum possible fees for undergraduate courses,"" she said. ""Three year courses remain the norm. And the level of fees charged do not relate to the cost or quality of the course."" She touched upon her ""first steps into politics"" as a councillor and chair of the education authority in Merton, south London, to declare that ""the needs of every child and young person deserve to be met"". Sky News asked Mrs May why she did not take action immediately to reduce interest rates on debts and reinstate maintenance grants. She said: ""We've already taken some action; we took action to raise the threshold the point at which people would start to pay back from £21,000 to £25,000 and we took action to freeze the level of fees."" Labour said the review was an ""unnecessary waste of time"", with shadow education secretary Angela Rayner declaring: ""Theresa May has finally admitted that her Government got it wrong."" Jeremy Corbyn's fees promise has piled pressure on the Conservatives to act, amid concerns about the debt burden on graduates. Universities in England can currently charge up to £9,250 a year in fees, with the £3,000 cap being lifted in 2012. The decision to abolish maintenance grants and replace them with loans has also sparked concern, with claims the policy hits the poorest students the hardest and saddles them with more debt. The prospect of fees for certain kinds of courses being reduced has been raised by Education Secretary Damian Hinds, while the Government has confirmed the interest rates charged on loans will be examined. But Mrs May was at pains to stress that the review would consider post-18 education as a whole, challenging the ""outdated"" view that only academic degrees are worthwhile. The PM said Britain needed an education system that is ""more flexible and diverse than it is today"", with university often considered the best option for young people by default."

He is believed to have left the venue a few minutes before the rest of the group, who called police when he failed to turn up for activities planned for that afternoon. Liam's brother Eamonn, who, along with his father and others, has stayed on in Hamburg to continue the search, said on Monday they confirmed a positive CCTV sighting of him at around 2.20am near the G&J building in Baumwall in the city. A witness reports seeing Liam and helping him up some steps to the main entrance of that building after he fell, an account backed up by CCTV. The footage then shows Liam trying unsuccessfully to get in to the building, before walking towards the Michelwiese Park. He is helped again by the same witness to get into this park, and is last seen heading towards the Portuguese Quarter at around 2.30am. Mr Colgan said: ""It's a positive for us that we've seen a positive CCTV image of him and we want to raise further awareness of him in that area."" Mr Colgan, whose wedding next month the group was celebrating, admits he is baffled by Liam's disappearance, calling it ""completely out of character"". ""The only theory we can have is that he's tried to make his way home. He planned the trip, so he's maybe decided 'I can find my way home. I'm gonna' go and do that,'"" he said. ""Whether he's injured himself in some way, he's had some sort of memory loss after maybe a fall, suffered some sort of head injury and maybe got lost?"", Mr Colgan added. The Lucie Blackman Trust, which is helping with the search, has launched an urgent appeal for information or CCTV images from people who were in the Baumwall area or the Portuguese Quarter of Hamburg at around 2.30am on 10 February. The trust said it is assessing a large number of calls and emails providing further potential sightings and information. Hamburg Police have been using search dogs and searching the Buxtehude area, next to Hamburg railway station where Liam was reportedly seen on Wednesday and Thursday. On a Facebook page set up to find Liam there have been reports about a ""confused Scotsman"" wandering the city of Hamburg."

Councillor Wells will officially stand down on 28 February. :: Waste of time to run again, ousted UKIP leader told Thanet was once one of UKIP's biggest target areas - with Nigel Farage narrowly missing out on winning a parliamentary seat there in 2015's general election. The move marks the latest downturn in UKIP's fortunes, with the party having at least four elected leaders since July 2016. On Sunday, Mr Bolton hinted at a comeback by suggesting he could stand in the upcoming election to replace himself. Asked by Sky News if he was considering standing once again, the former Army officer said: ""I don't know yet. I've just spoken to my team, we've had a quick batting around of the different options. I'm not ruling out any option at the moment."""
2018-02-19,"A gifted young academic who became a ""warped and sadistic"" paedophile has been jailed for 32 years.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180220043057/https://news.sky.com/story/dark-web-paedophile-matthew-falder-jailed-for-32-years-11257478,"Matthew Falder, 29, humiliated his victims and blackmailed them into performing ever-increasing acts of depravity on themselves and others, including the rape of a toddler. The computer whizz-kid committed all his crimes online, hiding behind dozens of false identities on the dark web. On some so-called ""hurtcore"" websites he was made a VIP member because of the ultra-depraved images he posted, granting him access to even more sickening material. He targeted girls, women, boys and men, but never met his victims. Three of those he tricked into sending him humiliating images tried to kill themselves. :: Paedophile victim: How I fell into Falder's trap Birmingham Crown Court heard how one young girl was made to lick a toilet seat and eat dog food, and that a father was forced to rape and torture his two-year-old son - in what Judge Philip Parker QC described as ""a tale of ever-increasing depravity"". He told ""warped and sadistic"" Falder: ""You wanted to assume total control over your victims. Your behaviour was cunning, persistent, manipulative and cruel. The damage you did is ongoing and will never end. ""Victims know those images still exist on the computers of unknown people."" It took the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) four years to identify Falder, track him down and arrest him, following a global investigation. When they did, he was not what they were expecting. They discovered he was a research physicist, public school-educated, and a star student from Cambridge University, where he was known as a party animal with many friends. Falder's double life began as a voyeur when he hid cameras in the bathrooms and toilets of his fellow students and friends. Later, he targeted teenagers, offering babysitting and dog-walking services for pocket money on the marketplace website Gumtree. Posing as a depressed female artist called Liz, he chose the most vulnerable, offering them money for topless pictures, then threatening them with exposure if they did not send more explicit and humiliating pictures. One male victim was blackmailed into eating his faeces and drinking urine. And in an email to one 15-year-old girl, he said: ""I wanted to offer you two choices. ""A) You take some more photos for me..... slightly different from before. ""B) I get upset, and instead of sending money, I send printouts of all the pictures you have done to your address, at many points in the future (in envelopes that your mother is likely to open)."" The victim told Sky News: ""I didn't tell anyone. I was really... I was ashamed. Obviously you've heard what the pictures were like. They were awful. And I didn't want any of my friends to know that I wanted to do that. ""It was all online, through the internet. I felt that no one would understand because there was no one there holding a knife to me saying 'you will do this', even though it felt like that. ""I don't talk to my family anymore at all because, for me, I felt that they wouldn't understand and didn't understand what had happened to me."" Prosecutor Ruona Iguyovwe told the court how Falder showed ""no shred of sympathy"" for his victims, even when they told him they were considering taking their own life. Instead, his reaction would usually be to ""reinforce his demands"". Falder - one of Britain's most prolific paedophiles - had 70 different online identities, including EvilMind and 666devil, and boasted to victims that he would never be caught. The NCA led a task force including US and Australian police, and even consulted the UK's spy centre GCHQ to uncover his true identity. When he was confronted with his crimes after being arrested last summer at Birmingham University, where he was working as a researcher after finishing a doctorate at Cambridge, he told investigators: ""That sounds like the rap sheet from hell."" The NCA's Matt Sutton said the investigation represented a ""watershed moment"". He said: ""In more than 30 years of law enforcement I've never come across an offender whose sole motivation was to inflict such profound anguish and pain. Matthew Falder revelled in it. ""His primary motivation was for power and control, suffering and humiliation. Believing he had superior intellectual and computational abilities, he was confident he could outwit law enforcement. ""I've also never known such an extremely complex investigation with an offender who was technologically savvy and able to stay hidden in the darkest recesses of the dark web."" Falder admitted 137 crimes, including encouraging rape, sexually exploiting children, blackmail and voyeurism, which were committed over an eight-year period. His lawyer said he acknowledged the impact of his crimes on his 46 victims and had pleaded guilty, so sparing them the ordeal of giving evidence in a trial. His wealthy family, from Cheshire, and his long-term girlfriend are said to be standing by him and have vowed to help rehabilitate him on release from jail. A spokesman for the university where he had excelled said his crimes had ""appalled and distressed"" the Cambridge community, while the NSPCC has branded him a ""despicable predator"". Gumtree also welcomed the conviction of Falder for his ""appalling offences"". A spokesman said: ""Our dedicated safety team has been working with the NCA in its investigation of this case for several years. We take the safety of our users extremely seriously and are committed to making the site as safe as possible."" The judge told Falder he will have to serve two-thirds of the 32 years before he is eligible for parole in 2038. Even then he will not be freed until the Parole Board decides he is no longer dangerous, and could have to serve the whole 32 years in prison."

Offences included rape, sexual assault and grooming. In almost 14,000 cases, the complainant was aged 10 or under, with 2,788 of the alleged offences perpetrated against children aged four or under. In 10% of cases, there was an online element involved. The figures were compiled from Freedom of Information requests submitted to forces across the UK. NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless said: ""This dramatic rise is extremely concerning and shows just how extensive child sexual abuse is. ""These abhorrent crimes can shatter a child's life, leaving them to feel humiliated, depressed or even suicidal. ""That is why it is crucial every single child who has endured abuse and needs support must get timely, thorough help so they can learn to rebuild their lives."" The charity says improved recording methods, survivors feeling more confident in coming forward and the emergence of online groomers as a ""significant problem"" could all have contributed to the increase. Mr Wanless said: ""These new figures suggest the police are making real progress in how they investigate sex offences against children. ""To help them tackle the issue going forward, we must ensure the police are equipped to work with other agencies and provide ongoing support and training to officers on the front line."""

The resulting scuffle was caught on TV cameras, with the Argentinian appearing to swing his arm at a Wigan fan before being pulled away by Wigan defender Cheyenne Dunkley. Aguero then broke free, approaching the fan again, before being pulled away by a team mate, and led away. Some Man city fans also threw advertising hoardings and objects including plastic bottles onto the pitch in response to the Latics fans flooding the pitch. Angry scenes followed with police and match stewards trying to regain control of the pitch. Earlier ill-temper on the touchline at half-time between team managers Pep Guardiola and Paul Cook seemed to have set the tone for the match. The pair then continued their dispute in the tunnel. Both clubs could now be in trouble with the FA over the crowd disturbances, and investigations will now take place into how the pitch invasion was allowed to take place. Wigan Athletic will now go on to face Southampton in the quarter-finals next month. It is the third time in six seasons that the League One team have made it to the last eight of the FA cup."

Winchester Crown Court heard the 39-year-old offered to give the youngster a ride instead - and they drove along a quiet farm road in Hampshire with good weather conditions and visibility. Thomas Wilkins, prosecuting, said: ""Alexander died when the defendant's car drove off the right-hand side into a long fence post which launched the vehicle into the air, flipping it and turning it through 270 degrees. ""No other vehicle was involved and the prosecution say that the fatal incident was caused by a simple driver error - in other words, Mr Cobden's driving fell below that required of a careful and competent driver."" Cobden is accused of causing death by careless driving but denies the charge. According to Mr Wilkins, the defendant said the Ferrari ""took off uncontrollably"" shortly before he had put his foot on the accelerator. The court heard Cobden said he had not experienced any difficulties with the vehicle before the crash, and ""ample evidence"" suggested the car had been in good working order earlier that day. Mr Wilkins said the defendant may have failed to realise that the left-hand drive had ""drifted"" off the road, adding: ""Another explanation is the defendant misjudged the formidable power of this iconic car, over-accelerated and lost control."" In court, the Ferrari F50 involved in the crash was described as ""the nearest you can get to a Formula One car on a public road"" as the model can go from 0mph to 60mph in less than four seconds. On the morning of the crash, Mr Wilkins said the Ferrari had been taken for a photo shoot in Lincolnshire in preparation for auction. He added that the car had also been driven by motoring journalist Richard Meaden, who described it as a ""fabulous example of the Ferrari F50"". The prosecutor told the court: ""(Cobden's) defence is that nothing he did caused the crash, rather it was due to some latent defect with the vehicle which caused it, without warning, to roar off and he was unable to control it or stop it in time."" The trial continues."

The original post, sent on Monday afternoon, said: ""Corbyn sold British secrets to Communist spies… get some perspective mate!!! Your priorities are a bit awry!"" Mr Corbyn strongly denies the claim. His spokesperson told Sky News: ""Jeremy has instructed solicitors to contact Ben Bradley to delete his libellous tweet or face legal action. ""These entirely false and ridiculous smears should not be given any credence whatsoever."" It came hours before the Tory security minister Ben Wallace was accused of comparing Mr Corbyn to double agent Kim Philby who worked as a British spy before defecting to the Soviet Union during the Cold War. He wrote: ""'Jeremy has been interested in foreign policy issues his entire political career' - Labour MP Louis Haigh - yup so was Kim Philby."" A previous spokesperson for Mr Corbyn, Matt Zarb-Cousin, replied: ""Ben as the UK's Minister of State for Security I'm gonna ask you to rethink this comparison between a British spy who defected to the Soviet Union and HM's Leader of the Opposition. ""Do we really want our political culture to degenerate to this level? Let's have some respect."" Mr Wallace later said he ""wasn't comparing, just saying that being interested in Foreign policy isn't an answer to the allegations being made"". He told Sky News: ""It was a light-hearted dig at Louise Haigh's excuse that Corbyn was interested in foreign affairs. ""I was simply saying Kim Philby was also interested in foreign affairs."" Both the Conservative Party and Mr Bradley have been approached for comment but none was received at the time of publication. The row over Mr Corbyn's past broke out after he denied a former Czech spy's claim he was paid by the Eastern bloc to spy on Britain in the 1980s. Mr Bradley has previously come under pressure for a string of controversial online comments. In January, he apologised for suggesting benefit claimants should be sterilised and penning a blog post titled: """"Public sector workers: they don't know they're born!"""
2018-02-19,The EU's chief Brexit negotiator has hosted a meeting with a group of senior MPs - but it was avoided by prominent Leavers.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180220043057/https://news.sky.com/story/senior-brexiteers-absent-from-meeting-with-eus-chief-negotiator-11258314,"Michel Barnier held the ""private discussion"" with members of the Commons' Brexit select committee in Brussels on Monday. A source told Sky News the contents would be discussed by MPs ahead of an evidence hearing on the progress of Brexit talks on Wednesday. Another said that ""some of what they discussed might influence their thinking down the line"". But several notable Brexiteers did not attend the meeting, including Tory MPs Jacob Rees-Mogg and Peter Bone, and the DUP's Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson. Among those who did go was Craig Mackinlay, who said the trip ""had the feel of groundhog day"". He claimed in an article for The Telegraph that Mr Barnier ""re-stated his fears of the UK undertaking post-Brexit divergence"", citing the potential for social, environmental and tax ""dumping"". ""The Empire is not for moving, Brexit in name only is the diet of the day, in case freedom looks too desirable to other recalcitrant (uncooperative) members,"" he added. After the meeting, Mr Barnier hosted more talks with the leaders of 10 of Endland's biggest cities outside London. The Core Cities group - representing areas such as Liverpool, Bristol and Newcastle - pressed for ""a deal that helps the positive flow of trade and skilled people between cities post-Brexit"". It came as Mr Barnier's deputy, Sabine Weyand, met with Downing Street's chief Brexit sherpa, Olly Robbins. Sky News understands the pair were hammering out more detail on the transition period - amid a public clash over issues of sovereignty. It prompted Mr Barnier to declare earlier this month that the so-called ""implementation period"" is ""not a given""."
2018-02-19,"One of the 46 victims of ""warped and sadistic"" paedophile Matthew Falder has spoken of her ""shame"" at how 'Liz' - the name Falder used to masquerade on a marketplace website - snared her online.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180220043057/https://news.sky.com/story/paedophile-victim-how-i-fell-into-matthew-falders-trap-11258004,"I was just advertising on a website for babysitting or dogwalking and other casual jobs while I was at school. 'Liz' emailed at first after a few days saying that she had work, and asked if she could get a personal email because she didn't like the way the website's interface was, which wasn't unusual. I gave her my personal email address and that's when she put forward the suggestion that she was an artist and wanted to draw life models. She just wanted to know if I was interested in just a few pictures just for her of me, just for drawing, and that no-one would see them and she would get rid of them once she'd done her drawing. :: 'Warped and sadistic' paedophile jailed It was all very peaceful and she said she'd send them to me so I could see them and see if I was happy with them. The first messages made you feel like you were in control, 'Liz' was always saying ""it's up to you"" and ""I understand if you don't want to"". They were nice and they didn't make you think anything was wrong. I sent some pictures and as soon as she got that she must've gone on the internet. She sent a threatening email saying that she'd found me on Facebook, she knew all of my friends and where I went to school. She would say this is your school, these are your friends, and if you don't do as I say I'm going to tell everyone. I'm going to send everyone the pictures, I'm going to send them to your house, to your neighbours, to your school. It was almost as soon as she'd got something she could use, that's when it turned. It was messages every day so it felt forever, by the time it finished it felt like it had been a lot longer than it probably had. Throughout everything it was always from Liz, as a woman, but the worse things got, the more horrific the pictures and images got, it had to be a man. The first picture wasn't anything like the things that were to follow. A woman wouldn't want to see another girl like that. I knew that it was not a woman anymore and that I was being lied to. It was hard because Liz knew me. There were pictures, which were awful, but there was a lot of intrusive questions about my life and how I felt, and my friends at school, and what was happening at home. I didn't tell anyone because I was ashamed. You have heard what the pictures were like, they were awful, and I didn't want any of my friends to think that I had wanted to do that. I don't think people would understand. There was no-one there holding a knife to me saying 'you have to do this', but it felt like it. It was really hard. I didn't want to go to school then, I didn't want to stay at home because they knew where I lived. At school I wasn't talking to my friends or thinking about what they were saying, I was just checking my phone to see if there was another message. I couldn't concentrate on anything. I couldn't talk to my family because I felt ashamed of what I was doing. I didn't want to talk to anyone, I didn't want to go out with my friends because he might be there. I didn't feel safe anywhere. Even if he was standing next to me in the street I wouldn't recognise them. That's what was scary, not knowing who it was or when they might get bored and send the pictures to all of my friends anyway. I think I'll always be scared of meeting new people and scared of sharing. Everyone has things that make them feel more vulnerable and I'll always be scared of inviting new people into my life. It's still been a long time since what happened with Liz and I still feel like that about people today. I don't talk to my family anymore at all, because I felt like they wouldn't understand and didn't understand what had happened to me. I was ashamed of what I'd done, so I don't really talk to people from school anymore. I left school and tried to make new friends who weren't there, even though my friends didn't know what was going on. All relationships broke down. But I've got my day in court. I know who Liz - Matthew Falder - is. I can see him. He is going to get punished for what he did to me and I want everyone else to have that day. I want them to tell someone. Tell a friend, tell your parents, tell someone at work, and tell the police, because even if takes some time, they can find these people and they will get punished."

The UK's counter-terror apparatus is of huge benefit to Europe - the security advantages are too important for EU countries to lose. It works both ways, mind. Britain benefits from the sharing of data connected to known criminals or terrorists in Europe. On Friday, the Heads of MI6, France's DGSE and Germany's BND came together to call for an agreement that will allow this exchange of information to continue post-Brexit. Largely speaking, everyone's on the same side here. But this was a speech for two audiences - the lofty collection of world leaders in the hall itself, and her party back home in Britain. At home lies a potential hurdle. Her pledge to ""respect"" the rules of the European Court of Justice won't go down well with Brexiteers. If May wants Britain to remain a within Europol or a stay part of the European Arrest Warrant, then it's hard to see how she can negotiate that and not be in some part under the jurisdiction of the ECJ. That's a battle she'll have to win another day. Today, May's speech did nothing to win Europe round to Brexit. It did little to convince the international sceptics that Britain isn't in retreat. But it did get a gentle nod of approval from Brussels. She'll take that."

Lukasz Herba, a 30-year-old Polish man, is on trial for her alleged kidnapping last July. He was arrested after he released Ms Ayling at the British consulate. Evidence shown to the Milan court featured Ms Ayling leading police to the farmhouse where she was held for six days. In the video, she walks up a grassy slope towards the farmhouse, before letting officers in with her. She is pictured wearing blue rubber gloves and pointing to parts of the house where she says she was held at various points during the six days. Ms Ayling also showed investigators the town where she went with Herba to get shoes and food. In court, Francesco Pesce, Ms Ayling's lawyer, said: ""The videos that were shown by the police were clarifying, she was explaining and describing everything without having any doubt and she was doing this in front of four policemen, this is self-explanatory. ""She was kind of indoctrinated to believe that these people were around the place and they were willing to kill her if she tried anything – that was not true of course but she couldn't know, she didn't even know where she was, she could have been in France, she had no idea she was in Italy. ""The city.... the town is not far from the border so even if she wanted to there was no way to escape safely and she is a model, she's not a policeman or an agent, it's normal."" The court previously heard Ms Ayling was ""drugged and stuffed in a suitcase"" when she was captured. Investigators have said the behaviour she exhibited during her capture is consistent with the effects of ketamine. Bozena Katia Kolakowska, Herba's laywer: ""They wanted to create noise around this abduction, they wanted it to go into all the newspapers, they wanted people to talk about it. Everything was done so that it would become news, and for it to be spoken of."" She added: ""I've never seen an abduction that ends like this."" Ms Ayling, from south London, insists she has told the truth about her captivity. The trial continues."

The 19-year-old allegedly opened gunfire at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Valentine's Day. Dressed in a red prison uniform and handcuffed, he kept his head bowed and stayed quiet during the hearing, which discussed how the documents would be sealed. Judge Elizabeth Scherer said she was in favour of openness wherever possible. She maintained the decision made in another court to keep the defence motion documents sealed from public view. It is understood Cruz has agreed to plead guilty if the death penalty is not pursued by prosecutors, but no decision has been made. In America, status hearings are not part of the trial. The defendant must attend, and they sometimes will advise of the plea they wish to enter. Cruz's family home was visited by police 39 times in seven years, according to documents seen by CNN last week. His lawyer Melissa McNeill, told reporters on Thursday that he was ""sad"", ""mournful"" and ""remorseful"", adding that he was a ""broken human being"" who was aware of what was going on. The teenager has reportedly confessed to the shooting. Among the dead were students at the school, a teacher and an American football coach. His second court appearance comes as funerals are held for the victims, and protests petition for tighter gun control. Earlier today, Donald Trump signalled his support for efforts to increase the regulation around gun ownership. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders revealed the President has spoken to a Democrat and a Republican about a bipartisan bill that would force states and federal agencies to report more frequently on offences that prohibit a person from buying a weapon. ""While discussions are ongoing and revisions are being considered, the President is supportive of efforts to improve the federal background check system,"" she said. The President's response to the tragedy has been met with anger. He tweeted that no child should feel unsafe at school, but several of the school's pupils criticised his affiliation with the National Rifle Association. He also criticised the FBI for spending ""too long"" looking into Russian collusion, allegedly missing the signals about Cruz before he carried out the shooting. Florida governor Rick Scott said the FBI should release records about its investigation about a tip it received about worrying behaviour by Cruz."

Its problems appeared to have deepened on Monday as an update on its website listed just over 80 UK restaurants, out of a total of 900, that were open at midday. However, that number had grown to more than 340 by Monday evening. On Sunday night 270 branches were open. A spokesman said it was ""too early to say"" how long it would take to reopen those that had been closed. The chain also said that where possible, staff would be ""redeployed onto alternative tasks or to other restaurants that remain open"". It added: ""We're encouraging team members to take holiday where possible but not forcing - the decision is up to them."" Salaried employees will be paid as normal, while others on short term contracts will be paid the average hours worked per day over the last 12 weeks, the company said. It said it was encouraging franchisees to adopt the same policies despite operating their own contracts of employment. KFC last week switched its delivery contract from Bidvest to DHL. In a light-hearted statement on its website informing consumers about the problems, it said: ""The chicken crossed the road, just not to our restaurants."" It added: ""We've brought a new delivery partner onboard, but they've had a couple of teething problems - getting fresh chicken out to 900 restaurants across the country is pretty complex! ""We won't compromise on quality, so no deliveries has meant some of our restaurants are closed, and others are operating a limited menu, or shortened hours.

2018-02-20,"As a new report by single parent charity Gingerbread finds a third of children with a working single parent live in poverty, former nurse Judith Healy shares her story.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180221073918/https://news.sky.com/story/my-life-as-a-single-parent-can-be-very-isolating-11259326,"Make no mistake, I like many others, didn't set out to become a single parent. I was married and unfortunately my marriage broke down, back in 2005. I had moved abroad with my two-year-old daughter and my husband was meant to join us a few months later. However, it wasn't to be and I became a single parent. After a period living abroad, I realised it would be better for my daughter Niamh and I to return to the UK. And that is when life began to get tricky – because I had no job, that meant I couldn't rent a house, despite the fact I had a guarantor and could pay six months upfront. I eventually found a place and we moved in on a cold snowy day in February 2007. I remember there was a problem with the heating so the house was bitterly cold. I was so grateful when my mum came with us for two weeks to help us settle in and look after my daughter. I used to be a nurse, but I immediately knew because the hours weren't nine to five they weren't compatible with being a single parent so I was forced to look at other options. I was delighted when within months I found a full-time job that was home-based, but the role only lasted six months before I was made redundant. I started looking for work while being supported by benefits, but most roles were simply incompatible with affordable child care. At this point I began to think about self-employment and with my experience in telemarketing set up as a sole-trader. For me the key advantage of self-employed homeworking is definitely the flexibility, and I can't stress that enough. Being self-employed means that if my daughter is unwell I can look after her, take her to the GP and adjust my workload to fit this in. But as anyone who is self-employed will tell you, it is never easy and at times you are overwhelmed with work and other times there is nothing. Last year I had very little work for a two-month period and I was forced to use the money I had saved just to live on. Like many single parents I receive help with my rent, but unlike many people my level of housing benefit fluctuates, because I am self-employed. Some weeks I earn nothing and other weeks a reasonable amount (well enough to live on). The feelings of despair at that time and failure were overwhelming. As a single parent, at times I have found it extremely difficult, saying ""no"" when your child asks for things you just can't afford. Putting food on the table and paying for our electricity and heat are my priorities. Once the door closes at night it can feel very isolating, and even more so when your children are ill. You don't like to become the person always asking for help. Life becomes an existence and at times it feels like you are treading water, waiting for the next thing to go wrong. Personally, I would like to see more sustainable employment and the trend to demonise single parents stopped. Many of us are well-qualified, but because of our circumstances we end up in low-paid jobs. We don't all have family support nearby and many of us are isolated. I have recently set up a Gingerbread Friendship Group where I live to help other single parents meet and make friends, as well as have an adult conversation about the realities of being a single parent. To other single parents, my advice would be: You are working hard, you are a good role model and in time your children will respect you for doing your best."
2018-02-20,"The rapid development of drones and artificial intelligence is a ""game-changer"" that will present a serious threat to national security if it isn't addressed.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180221073918/https://news.sky.com/story/bot-and-drone-misuse-could-lead-to-cybercrime-explosion-11259915,"The assessment, made by 26 experts from institutions including Cambridge and Oxford Universities, warns of the potential for malicious use of artificial intelligence (AI) by rogue states, criminals, and terrorists. The panel forecast a rapid growth in cybercrime and the misuse of drones during the next decade - as well an unprecedented rise in the use of 'bots' to manipulate everything from elections to the news agenda and social media. The report warns that computers could be used to mimic people's voices and hack into personal data, fleets of autonomous vehicles could be hacked into and made to crash, and drones could use face-targeting missiles to locate victims. Once information has been hacked, critical infrastructure could then be held to ransom. ""AI will alter the landscape of risk for citizens, organisations and states - whether it's criminals training machines to hack or 'phish' at human levels of performance or privacy-eliminating surveillance, profiling and repression - the full range of impacts on security is vast,"" warned Miles Brundage, of Oxford University. The report recommends that governments give more consideration to how the threat can be mitigated. One of the report's authors, Dr Sean O hEigeartaigh, from Cambridge University said that ""artificial intelligence is a game changer and this report has imagined what the world could look like in the next five to ten years. ""We live in a world that could become fraught with day-to-day hazards from the misuse of AI and we need to take ownership of the problems - because the risks are real. ""There are choices that we need to make now, and our report is a call-to-action for governments, institutions and individuals across the globe."" A spokesman for the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) told Sky News that the ""The NCSC protects the UK against cyber-attacks from a range of threat actors, including nation states and criminals. ""We are vigilant to threats, wherever they come from, and ready to defend against them using the full spectrum of capabilities at our disposal. ""We are working to make the UK a hard target and raise the cost for those who would do us harm."""

However, she was then given a yellow card by judges for an offence during the race. With her hopes of a medal dashed she was carried from the arena by teammates, apparently suffering pain following an ankle injury sustained earlier in the week. The decision puts an end to the three-time world champion's 2018 Games, which have proved an emotional roller coaster. Already a high-stakes competition in the wake of a devastating triple disqualification at Sochi 2014, Christie's Olympics this year has been plagued by setbacks. The skater first fell in her bid for gold at the women's 500m final, appearing to lose her balance and crash into the barriers after getting close to another competitor. On Sunday, she crashed out of the women's 1,500m semi-final, falling on the last bend before being taken from the stadium on a stretcher. Christie said under normal circumstances the injury would have kept her in recovery for six weeks, but that Olympic hopes drove her to race again on Tuesday. ""The worst that could happen is I'd damage it more... but for me it didn't matter,"" she said after the disqualification. ""I trained all my life for this, it was everything to me and... it's done."" She showed incredible heart and courage to battle through injury and complete the race.What a competitor. @Elise_Christie pic.twitter.com/fJCIiDbJEu She appeared philosophical despite the emotion that followed her final race, and social media was flooded with messages of support for her determination to keep competing despite repeated setbacks. The athlete retweeted a photograph of a young fan who held a sign reading ""Elise I think you are amazing"", and pledged to return to the Beijing Olympics in 2022. She said she did not know why she had received a yellow card. ""We did everything we could to turn this around. It wasn't meant to be,"" she said."
2018-02-20,"Henry Bolton became leader 142 days ago. And for 142 days in the sun, he has lost, more or less everything.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180221073918/https://news.sky.com/story/whither-ousted-ukip-leader-henry-bolton-11255778,"He has lost his wife, his family, his day job and today he lost the leadership of the party which had thrust him into the spotlight. When he became leader, 142 days ago, I was in the hall in Torquay. I remember that he was elected on a promise to professionalise the party. When I asked him, a few days ago, how that was going, he could only wince. Instead of professionalisation, his leadership has seen the party sink to new lows of infighting and humiliation. After the revelations of his mistress Jo Marney's racism, he received a unanimous vote of no confidence in his leadership from the party's National Executive Committee. Since then he has experienced the undoing of his private life and intense media scrutiny, which he compared to me as akin to that endured by Princess Diana. He hoped he could survive. Going into the make or break meeting, I was told that he had good reason to be hopeful. Nigel Farage had backed him; he had coachloads of supporters being brought in and he had apparently re-geared the race into a referendum on the unpopular NEC. Yet in the end, it wasn't even close. What happened? The media were banned from the meeting itself but sources who were inside tell me that to some extent, Mr Bolton lost it on the day. He made a bellicose speech which barely mentioned the allegations against him. He appeared ""arrogant"" and ""without contrition"". He launched a blistering attack on the NEC which he slammed as: ""The enemy within. The only loyalty these people have is to themselves. Their actions are despicable."" Mr Bolton's opponents were equally unforgiving. Sources tell me that Steve Crowther, former acting leader, speaking on behalf of the NEC, was scathing, ""going hard on Bolton lying to his family and wife"". Mr Crowther said: ""It is not that he has done wrong but that he refuses to accept that he has done wrong. ""It is not about the morality of what he has done but his political judgement. He has developed a reputation for being unreachable and always late. He is also a liar."" He then accused Mr Bolton of telling untruths about his CV. Up to then the forces seemed evenly balanced, with both sides being booed and heckled. The game-changer came when Paul Oakley, general-secretary of the party, addressed the crowd and revealed that Mr Bolton had only days before threatened to try and stop the Emergency General Meeting with legal action. In his right of reply, Mr Bolton did not deny this but indeed threatened it again. This did not go down well with the undecided voters. Threatening to sue your own party is not a good look. At that moment a source texted me: ""He's a goner."" The meeting was bitter and nasty but the rebels succeeded and Mr Bolton is gone. But for how much longer? On Thursday, Mr Bolton confirmed to me that he ""had three options"" if he lost. Today he confirmed to me that he was considering running for leader again. He said: ""You can't keep a good man down. You certainly haven't heard the last of me in politics."" He might well run again, there is nothing to prohibit him from doing so under the party's rules. He received 37% of the no-confidence vote. Under the UKIP's First Past the Post electoral system, he need not get a majority of the votes in a leadership contest, just one more than the second placed candidate. Talking to those in the hall, he clearly has supporters who would rally to his cause again. Senior UKIP figures are disparaging of the prospect. Welsh leader Neil Hamilton told me ""that he might well run, as he's shown he's no stranger to humiliation"". Gerard Batten, the interim leader, said that if he is thinking about it Mr Bolton should ""get a life"". But as a senior UKIP source told me: ""He might well do it, because he's lost everything else."" He is chasing the dying of the light. Whatever happens to Mr Bolton, his is a sorry tale but UKIP's story could be sorrier still. It is now on its seventh leader in 18 months. It faces the prospect of another leadership election which it cannot afford. It heads into a set of local elections where it is defending hundreds of seats, with no permanent leader. There are even rumours that its great hero Mr Farage - his spell over the apparently party broken - might set up a new party with former donor Aaron Banks. One woman will be relieved: Theresa May. The hardest proponents of the hardest Brexit are off the battlefield. That gives her breathing space on her Eurosceptic flank. In the end, UKIP have simply lost their reason to be. Like Del Boy after he finally became a millionaire, now their lifetime ambition of Brexit has been achieved, they just do not quite know quite what to do with themselves. The sticking plaster, which bound this disparate band of libertarians, social conservatives, economic protectionists, working class socialists and shire Tories together, has been ripped off. There's not much left. UKIP have been written off before. But in Birmingham, the stench of death is everywhere. As one source texted me as we all headed for home: ""Dead within a year, I reckon."""

""Even before we came to awards ceremonies we would walk into a guitar store and be asked 'What do you want? Do you want a tambourine? Do you want a starter guitar? Or, 'This guitar isn't for you - it's too heavy'. ""We need more female producers, more female lighting designers, mixers. We make it a very, very big priority to hire women to work with us."" The Brit Awards themselves are starting out on message this year with London born Dua Lipa leading the way with five nominations. Not only is she nominated for best female solo artist but also best single and best album of the year. However Ed Sheeran is favourite to win in the main categories so The Brits could be in danger of following in the footsteps of the Grammy's, where they only actually handed out one award to a woman in the major categories. The artist Little Boots has moved to LA and has started her own record company in pursuit of more control in what she says is a very male dominated business. ""The music industry is a very sexist industry, women are still hugely underrepresented in so many roles, especially women running record labels, women in A&R. Women producers are still hugely underrepresented."" She does however believe things are starting to change and the fact we are talking about the issue, she says can only be a good thing. Brit nominees and those attending the ceremony are being urged to wear white roses to show their solidarity for the Time's Up campaign as they did at the Grammy's. The campaign started in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal and its aim is to combat sexual assault and harassment in the entertainment industry. Representatives were on the red carpet on Sunday night at the Bafta's where women wore black to highlight the issue. Dua Lipa is favourite to win best female solo artist. She'll compete with Jessie Ware, Kate Tempest, Laura Marling and Paloma Faith. Ed Sheeran's biggest competition will be Stormzy in the best male category, but also in the running are Liam Gallagher, Loyle Carner and Rag'N'Bone Man.

It later said, at lunchtime, that 430 were now trading. There was confusion when, earlier in the day - and apparently due to a glitch - it had said that just three sites - in Glasgow, Hereford, and Luton - were up and running as of 11am. KFC has said it is working ""flat out"" to reopen branches after problems with deliveries on Friday and over the weekend, but added that some disruption will continue. A spokesperson said: ""We anticipate the number of closures will reduce today and over the coming days as our teams work flat out all hours to clear the backlog. ""Each day more deliveries are being made, however, we expect the disruption to some restaurants to continue over the remainder of the week, meaning some will be closed and others operating with a reduced menu or shortened hours."" By Monday lunchtime just 80 were listed as open, though the number increased to more than 300 by later that day. Customers voiced their frustration on social media, with stories of children crying as they missed out on a treat. In London, police even had to warn that the so-called ""KFC crisis"" was not a matter for them. Please do not contact us about the #KFCCrisis - it is not a police matter if your favourite eatery is not serving the menu that you desire. Staff have also had to change their plans. The chain said that where possible, they would be ""redeployed onto alternative tasks or to other restaurants that remain open"". It added that where possible it was encouraging team members to take holiday though not forcing them. Salaried employees will be paid as normal, while others on short term contracts will be paid the average hours worked per day over the last 12 weeks, the company said. KFC said it was encouraging franchisees to adopt the same policies despite operating their own contracts of employment. The fast-food chain last week switched its delivery contract from Bidvest to DHL. In a light-hearted statement on its website informing consumers about the problems, the restaurant said: ""The chicken crossed the road, just not to our restaurants."" DHL said on Monday: ""Due to operational issues a number of deliveries in recent days have been incomplete or delayed."" The company has said it was working ""to rectify the situation as a priority and apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused""."

Using the hashtag #OneLess, Mr Pappalardo said he wanted to ensure the weapon ""will never be able to take a life"" as he sawed off the barrel of the gun. It comes a week after the Valentine's Day mass shooting at a high school in Parkland which left 17 people dead and prompted survivors to call for stricter gun controls. In his video, Mr Pappalardo said he was a ""firm believer"" in the right to bear arms - which he had tattooed on his arm - but he did not believe civilians should possess weapons that can cause ""so much death and destruction"". He pointed out that Cruz - and Stephen Paddock, who slaughtered 58 people in Las Vegas last year in America's worst mass shooting - were both legal gun owners. ""Quite frankly any legal gun owner is capable of snapping and committing a horrific crime, even without mental illness,"" he said. ""I've decided today, I'm going to make sure this weapon will never be able to take a life. ""The barrel of this gun will never be pointed at someone."" Hollywood star Julianne Moore praised Mr Pappalardo's video, tweeting: ""Please watch this eloquent gun owner explain why he destroyed his gun. ""Thank you #ScottPappalardo for your example."" Broward Sheriff's Office, which responded to the mass shooting last week, thanked gun-owner Ben Dickmann after he shared photos of himself disposing of his high-powered AR-57 rifle. In his Facebook post, which has been shared more than 200,000 times, Mr Dickmann said ""no one without a law enforcement badge needs this rifle"" as he handed it over to the police. ""I could have easily sold this rifle, but no person needs this,"" he wrote. ""I will be the change I want to see in this world. ""If our law makers will continue to close their eyes and open their wallets, I will lead by example. #outofcirculation."" Responding to Mr Dickmann, Broward Sheriff's Office tweeted: ""Thank you Ben for sharing this."" Meanwhile, a high school headteacher in Missouri has apologised for promoting raffle tickets for AR-15 rifles hours after the Florida massacre. South Elementary School principal Lee Woodward told ABC News the raffle was to raise funds for her son's baseball team, adding: ""I am truly sorry to any who were offended or concerned by the team's raffle. ""It was never my intention to offend anyone but to simply support my son and his teammates."""

Mr Forsyth, who is now deputy executive director of Unicef, said that he made ""some personal mistakes"" during his time at Save the Children. ""I recognise that on a few occasions I had unsuitable and thoughtless conversations with colleagues, which I now know caused offence and hurt,"" he said in a statement. ""When this was brought to my attention on two separate occasions, I apologised unreservedly to the three colleagues involved."" Mr Forsyth said he thought the incidents ""closed many years ago"", but the charity has said a further review was required after concerns were raised that ""matters should not have been left as they were"". Unicef said it was aware of the complaints. :: Aid worker: 'I was drugged and raped by a fellow humanitarian' Mr Forsyth was chief executive at Save the Children from 2010 to 2015, during which time Brendan Cox, husband of murdered MP Jo Cox, was also working for the charity. Mr Cox has admitted that while there some of his behaviour towards women would have made them feel ""uncomfortable"" and said he would take ""take full responsibility"" for his actions. He has stepped down from two charities he helped set up in the wake of his wife's murder and apologised for the ""hurt and offence"" that some of his past behaviour at Save the Children had caused. The current chief executive Kevin Watkins appeared before a committee of MPs on Tuesday and insisted the organisation was ""not complacent"" about allegations against staff. Oxfam's beleaguered CEO Mark Goldring also gave evidence to the committee and confirmed that 26 new cases of inappropriate behaviour were being investigated and that 7,000 regular donors have stopped giving money to the charity following allegations of sexual misconduct against some of its workers in Haiti."

""This is clearly not where I want to be, but I have no other choice,"" she said. Ms Bradley made the admission in Parliament, on the first day it reconvened since talks to re-establish an executive in the devolved assembly broke down. She said Northern Ireland ""needs certainty and clarity"" as it edged towards its 14th month without a government. The Staffordshire Moorlands MP also revealed she was ""looking at proposals"" to pause or cap Assembly members' salaries. And she gave a firm rebuttal to claims from some leading Brexiteers - including one of her predecessors Owen Paterson - that the Good Friday Agreement had ""run its course"". ""The people of Northern Ireland have come so far in 20 years,"" she said. ""It is absolutely vital that we restored devolved government and we retain the Belfast Agreement."" Ms Bradley added she would come back to Parliament to update MPs when she had more detail on a budget for Stormont. She also praised James Brokenshire, who stepped down as Northern Ireland Secretary in January to focus on his health after discovering a lesion on his lung. Ms Bradley called him an ""outstanding"" minister who was ""very missed"" and described in the ""warmest, most generous terms"". The Northern Ireland Secretary has been encouraged to impose a budget for the country by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), but urged not to by Sinn Fein. DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds told Ms Bradley it was a ""dereliction of duty"" for her not to pass a budget. ""It's time to get on with it,"" he said. It comes after power-sharing talks broke down between the DUP and Sinn Fein, with the unionists blaming differences over an Irish Language Act on there being ""no prospect"" of a deal. Sinn Fein claimed that it was the DUP which ""failed to close the deal""."

The UK's counter-terror apparatus is of huge benefit to Europe - the security advantages are too important for EU countries to lose. It works both ways, mind. Britain benefits from the sharing of data connected to known criminals or terrorists in Europe. On Friday, the Heads of MI6, France's DGSE and Germany's BND came together to call for an agreement that will allow this exchange of information to continue post-Brexit. Largely speaking, everyone's on the same side here. But this was a speech for two audiences - the lofty collection of world leaders in the hall itself, and her party back home in Britain. At home lies a potential hurdle. Her pledge to ""respect"" the rules of the European Court of Justice won't go down well with Brexiteers. If May wants Britain to remain a within Europol or a stay part of the European Arrest Warrant, then it's hard to see how she can negotiate that and not be in some part under the jurisdiction of the ECJ. That's a battle she'll have to win another day. Today, May's speech did nothing to win Europe round to Brexit. It did little to convince the international sceptics that Britain isn't in retreat. But it did get a gentle nod of approval from Brussels. She'll take that."

Critics accused Mr Davis of living in ""living in cloud cuckoo land"", claiming his rhetoric was at odds with previous statements from prominent Brexiteers. His speech was the latest in a series of ""road to Brexit"" addresses by top Government figures, following on from Prime Minister Theresa May and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. Mr Davis told an audience of business leaders in Vienna that a common commitment to high regulatory standards should mean that trade remains as ""frictionless as possible"" after the divorce is finalised. He insisted the Government will maintain its track record of high standards outside of the EU and had no plans to engage in a new ""race to the bottom"". ""I know that for one reason or another there are some people who have sought to question that these really are our intentions,"" Mr Davis said. ""They fear that Brexit could lead to an Anglo-Saxon race to the bottom, with Britain plunged into a Mad Max-style world borrowed from dystopian fiction. ""These fears about a race to the bottom are based on nothing - not history, not intention, nor interest."" Commitments on workers' rights, support for a stable European banking system and animal welfare reforms were all examples of the UK's determination to spearhead a ""race to the top"", Mr Davis argued. There have been increasing calls from Brussels for more detail from Britain on the exact terms of the agreement it is seeking in the Brexit negotiations. On that theme, Mr Davis said it was mutually beneficial for both sides to be able to continue to trust each other's regulations and the institutions that enforce them. ""Such mutual recognition will naturally require close, even-handed co-operation between these authorities and a common set of principles to guide them,"" he said. ""This will be a crucial part of ensuring our future economic partnership is as open and trade remains as frictionless as possible. ""I am certain that is in the interests of both sides and, because of that, I am certain that we can get this right."" In the event that one side or the other wants to change regulations, it is imperative that it does not lead to ""unnecessary"" barriers to trade being thrown up,"" Mr Davis reasoned. On the wider question of a Brexit deal, Mr Davis said an agreement by the end of the year is ""well on the cards"" and talked down the prospect of there being no deal. Meanwhile, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox has warned the EU against imposing new trade barriers post-Brexit, saying it would make their own economies less competitive. He said the Government was committed to safeguarding the interests of British exporters in the negotiations. Reacting to Mr Davis' speech, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said it ""simply isn't worth the paper it's written on"". He said: ""How are people meant to trust the Brexit Secretary when his colleague Liam Fox has said current protections mean it's 'too difficult' to fire staff and Boris Johnson has described workers' rights coming from the EU as 'back-breaking'? ""The truth is there are many in Theresa May's government who want to use Brexit as an excuse to drive down standards and weaken fundamental rights."" Green Party leader Caroline Lucas was withering in her assessment, writing on Twitter: ""David Davis really is living in cloud cuckoo land, isn't he?"" David Davis really is living in cloud cuckoo land, isn't he? Other EU governments will have heard Brexit ministers boasting about how Brexit will be a chance for massive deregulation  - and they won't take kindly to it. https://t.co/ScohVDPJh8"

The charity Gingerbread says the estimated 1.7m single parent families are being let down by a lack of government and workplace support. Its 'One in Four' report provides a profile of the families in the UK today headed by a single parent and highlights the progress made in recent years. According to researchers, 68% of single mums or dads are now in work with more than half classed as self-employed. However, the charity says that many of those who are self-employed have been forced down that often volatile and low-paid route because of a lack of opportunities and jobs. Research suggests that there has been a tenfold rise of zero-hours contracts in the last ten years. Rosie Ferguson, the Chief Executive of Gingerbread is calling on the government to do more to support working single parents: ""Single parents are being let down at the moment - there's absolutely no reason why single parents and their children shouldn't be able to participate fully in the economy but they are twice as likely to be living in poverty as children in couple families. ""I think that's a result of the fact that our workforce is not friendly or accessible to people with families."" The Resolution Foundation is an independent think-tank that aims to improve the standard of living of low and middle-income families. It is concerned about the impact of Universal Credit on single parent families. Connor D'Arcy from the organisation said: ""single parents are more likely to be in receipt of tax credits and when they move onto Universal Credit, people who are not working and those who are, will face cuts. ""Some of those cuts for families will be quite large, we're talking over a thousand pounds for some of those families. ""It's something where the government could act and make a really positive difference for single parents."" A Government spokesperson said: ""We recognise how challenging it can be for lone parents to juggle work and family life. ""That's why we've taken steps to double free childcare, and for the most in need paying up to 85% of their childcare costs under Universal Credit, to support parents back into work. ""Children living in households where someone works are less likely to be in poverty and more likely to do well in school, compared to those growing up in workless households. ""Our support is all about ensuring every child and family has the best chances in life."""

But Alfie's parents Kate James and Tom Evans, who are both in their 20s, wanted treatment to continue. They believe their son responds to them. Alfie's mother Kate left the court hearing before the judge reached his conclusion and his father broke down as the decision was announced. Mr Justice Hayden made his ruling after analysing the dispute at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in Liverpool earlier this month. Doctors said that Alfie, who was born on 9 May 2016, was in a ""semi-vegetative state"" and had a degenerative neurological condition they had not definitively diagnosed. The judge had visited Alfie in hospital and has praised his parents for trying to leave no stone unturned. Mr Justice Hayden said he accepted medical evidence which showed further treatment was futile. He said his conclusion was reached with great sadness. ""Alfie's need now is for good quality palliative care,"" he said. ""He requires peace, quiet and privacy in order that he may conclude his life as he has lived it, with dignity."" Around 30 members of ""Alfie's Army"" were outside the children's hospital supporting the family's campaign as they awaited the decision. They chanted ""Save Alfie Evans"" and cried as they received the news. Danielle Page, 32, from St Helens, said: ""It is devastating. He's not lying there like a vegetable, he's a little boy, he's a miracle. He needs a chance. ""Everything that's been thrown at him, he's battled through. We are not going to give up."""

But a City watchdog campaign to reach victims of the payment protection insurance (PPI) mis-selling scandal before the 2019 deadline for claims - featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger - helped Lloyds' bill for past conduct swell to £2.5bn. This is a £400m rise on the year before - and in the fourth quarter, it set aside an extra £600m to cover the cost of compensating victims of mis-sold PPI, with Lloyds' overall bill for the scandal now standing at £18.7bn. The bank said its profit figure was the largest since the group was formed, when Lloyds took over troubled rival Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) during the financial crisis before itself being bailed out by the Government. Revenues rose 6% to £18.5bn. Lloyds also confirmed plans to reward investors with a share buyback worth up to £1bn, first reported by Sky News, and a 20% increase in its total dividend. Shares rose 1%. The results mark the latest stage in the lender's recovery under chief executive Antonio Horta-Osorio and come after the Government finally divested its remaining holdings in the business after its £20bn taxpayer rescue. Mr Horta-Osorio said: ""2017 has been a landmark year in which the group has made significant strategic progress and returned to full private ownership."" The group also revealed a rise of more than £600,000 - or 11% - in Mr Horta-Osorio's pay packet to £6.42m. His basic pay rose by £95,000 and there were hikes totalling more than £500,000 in performance bonus and long-term incentives. Mr Horta-Osorio unveiled a new three-year strategic plan that will see Lloyds invest more than £3bn, with a focus on boosting its digital capabilities. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at a Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""There's a lot to like in Lloyds' numbers, with profits rising, costs under control, and prodigious amounts of cash being thrown off to shareholders. ""The Bank of England can take its fair share of credit for Lloyds' profits, as rising interest rates have delivered a boost to the top line at Lloyds. ""For the banking industry, the prospect of rising rates after a decade of loose monetary policy is a bit like finally coming across an oasis in the middle of the desert. ""With more rate rises waiting in the wings, this looks like a tailwind that's going to be blowing behind Lloyds for the foreseeable future."""

The FBI said in court documents it believes Bennett ""knowingly and unlawfully killed"" Ms Hellmann, the mother of their 19-month-old daughter, Emelia. Last May, the newlyweds were heading back to their home in Delray Beach, Florida, when Bennett says he felt the boat hit something. The 41-year-old said his wife was at the helm at the time but when he looked for her she was gone and the 37-foot Surf Into Summer was sinking. An expert later said the vessel had been ""intentionally scuttled"" after two underwater escape hatches were opened. Bennett reported that his wife was missing in an SOS call in the early hours of 15 May. Investigators claim Bennett did not activate his satellite phone or register his personal locator beacon until he was in Cuba on the final leg of the voyage. He wanted to ""ensure his own rescue and survival after murdering his wife and intentionally scuttling his catamaran,"" they said. The US Coast Guard searched for four days but her body was not found. Bennett, from Poole, took to a life raft and was rescued hours later. He had a backpack, buoys, gallons of water and nine plastic tubes containing 235 stolen English and Canadian coins with him when the Coast Guard found him. The haul, worth up to £28,500 ($38,480) was found to be part of a haul valued at £72,000 ($100,000) stolen from an employer's boat in 2016. Bennett, a British-Australian citizen, was sentenced to seven months in prison, followed by three years of probation for charges relating to the discovery of the coins. A day after the search for Ms Hellmann was abandoned, Bennett asked Palm Beach County Court to have Hellmann declared dead so he could settle her estate. A judge refused his request."

""She was clearly in a very bad way. She was bleeding a lot and turning blue,"" said Mr Conway. ""I found out there was no air ambulance and the first aid supplies were really poor. All I had to use were some wet wipes, tissues and tape."" He fought for 30 minutes to stem the woman's bleeding and was joined by a nurse who was also on the trek. Mr Conway covered up the woman with shirts and coats, and kept pinching her to keep her awake. A human chain carried her out on a stretcher but they then faced a five-hour trek to the bottom of the volcano. ""She was obviously in severe pain and the nurse and I were worried she might have spinal injuries, but she never once complained,"" said Mr Conway, who is based at Birmingham's Highgate Community Fire Station. ""We paused every 10 minutes so the nurse and I could speak to her and stop her losing consciousness."" Once at the base they discovered the ambulance was an estate car with a driver and paramedics. The nearest hospital was also two hours away. ""The nurse and I went with her, and I was crouched in the back of the ambulance the whole way. It was a nightmare journey. What little oxygen there was ran out half way, and we had to stop for fuel,"" said Mr Conway. Luckily the woman made it to hospital and is recovering from broken bones, fractured ribs and spine, and a serious head injury. The firefighter said it is a ""miracle"" she survived. ""She's still in hospital, but she's managed to get thanks to me for what we were able to do."" John's watch commander, Chris Gauntlett, praised his bravery and quick thinking. He said: ""John has been a firefighter for eight years and has been with us for a year after moving from Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service. ""I'm not at all surprised to hear that he did everything he could to help this young woman. ""I've managed to have a brief chat with him to check he's OK, and we're looking forward to welcoming him back to the station."""
2018-02-20,"The Government have been accused of ""defending the indefensible"" after coming under pressure from MPs to grant access to medical cannabis to a six-year-old epilepsy sufferer.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180221073918/https://news.sky.com/story/government-defending-the-indefensible-over-alfie-dingleys-request-for-cannabis-treatment-11259418,"Alfie Dingley, from Warwickshire, has a rare and extreme form of epilepsy and can suffer up to 30 seizures a day. His parents, Hannah Deacon and Drew Dingley, want to treat him with medical cannabis, which he was treated with in the Netherlands last year but is illegal in the UK. Alfie's use of cannabis treatment is said to reduce both the severity and the frequency of his clusters of seizures, coming once every 27 days rather than every 7-10 days. It has been claimed the youngster faces ""early psychosis and a premature death"" if he has to revert to the steroid-based treatment he received before travelling to the Netherlands. Home Office minister Nick Hurd, answering an urgent question in the House of Commons about the case on Tuesday, said both he and the Government ""sympathise deeply"" with Alfie and his family. The Tory MP insisted ministers ""want to help try and find a solution within the existing regulation"" but pushed back against any imminent change in law to allow Alfie the medical use of cannabis. Mr Hurd highlighted the UK's ""clear regime"" for the testing of medicines as he stated the Government would not currently issue licences for the personal consumption of cannabis, because it is listed as a schedule one drug. ""The current situation is that cannabis in its raw form is not recognised in the UK as having any medicinal benefits,"" he said. The Government will wait for the outcome of a World Health Organisation review of medical cannabis ""before considering any next steps"", the minister added. Mr Hurd told MPs: ""The whole House will understand it is a natural desire for parents to do everything they can to ensure their children do not suffer unnecessarily. ""But we also need to make sure that cannabis is subjected to the same regulatory framework that applies to all medicines in the UK. ""We must ensure that only medicines that have been tested for their safety to the correct standard are prescribed for UK children."" He also noted how MPs will have another chance to debate the issue on Friday, when Labour MP Paul Flynn is set to give a second reading to his Private Member's Bill on allowing the production, supply, possession and use of cannabis and cannabis resin for medicinal purposes. Mr Hurd's comments in Parliament brought fierce criticism from Maggie Deacon, Alfie's grandmother, although she welcomed his offer to meet with the family. ""The minister was defending the indefensible - allowing my grandson to suffer or die when he can be helped,"" she said. ""We welcome the minister's commitment to meet us and try to find a way forward, but it has to be soon - time is running out. ""The medicine exists. The Dutch medics have prescribed it and strongly recommended its continuing use. ""We don't need another trial. Alfie has taken the medicine in Holland and its worked. That's the only trial that matters for Alfie."" Conservative backbencher Crispin Blunt, who asked the urgent question of Mr Hurd, described Alfie's situation as an ""open and shut case"" on health grounds. He said: ""Failure of the Government to move from its current position would sentence Alfie back to the steroid-based treatment he was receiving before he went to the Netherlands, which is likely to give him early psychosis and a premature death."""

Although she had been spotted by rescuers around six months earlier, she managed to elude capture until she became too ill to keep up with the rest of her group. She was finally caught by the Friends of Horsey Seals who used a net to scoop her up and took her to the RSPCA East Winch Wildlife Centre. Staff, who said Frisbee had been starving for a long period of time and was on the brink of death, were then able to cut the frisbee from her throat. RSPCA manager Alison Charles said: “Seals are inquisitive creatures by nature, so it’s likely she spotted the frisbee in the water and went over to investigate and that’s how it became stuck round her neck. “Over the months she has grown and as result it has become more and more embedded in her neck and it is likely that towards the end it would have been restricting her from eating and drinking.” The injured seal spent five months with the RSPCA being treated with antibiotics, painkillers and steroids to heal the deep and infected wound. Frisbee, who staff describe as a “fighter”, will now be released back to her home beach at Horsey Gap, Norfolk. Her plight highlights the problems discarded plastic marine litter can cause for the UK's wildlife. Peter Ansell, chairman of the Friends of Horsey Seals, told Sky News: “They get these things stuck around their neck – we call them ‘necklaces’ for want of a better word – things like fishing nets, rubber tyres, fishing lines, and in this case a frisbee. They get their heads through, but can’t get out. “Just last week we found another seal on the same beach with a fishing net embedded tightly around her neck, and sent her on to the RSPCA hospital too”. Mr Ansell said at least five other seals with things stuck around their neck have been sighted on the beach, but rescuers have so far been unable to catch them. He concluded, “While people keep throwing stuff into the ocean, we’re going to have to put up with the end result, which is the destruction of sea creatures.” :: Sky's Ocean Rescue campaign encourages people to reduce their single-use plastics.

She entered her plea at North Stafforshire Justice Centre on Tuesday. The note read: ""If this van is for anyone but Number 14 then you have no right to be parked here. ""I couldn't give a s*** if the whole street collapsed. Now move your van from outside my house."" The ambulance had been responding to her next-door neighbour's 999 call to assist his wife, who was ""experiencing breathing difficulties"", prosecutor Liz Ryder told magistrates. Sharman then went into the street and abused a male paramedic, telling him: ""Move your f***ing van."" Ms Ryder added there had been ""ongoing difficulties"" between Sharman and her neighbours, leading to a restraining order being issued against her in January. Sentencing Sharman, chairman of the magistrates Christopher Rushton told her: ""This was an absolutely despicable incident. ""The fact it was directed at an ambulance crew providing a public service to a sick person. That crew should not be subject to actions such as these."" Through her solicitor Hayley Keegan, Sharman offered her ""most sincere apologies to the ambulance staff"" in court. ""She accepts the behaviour was completely unacceptable,"" her solicitor said. Sharman was also ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £30 and £135 costs, while a separate charge of breaching a restraining order was withdrawn by the prosecution. After the note was found over the weekend, Katie Tudor, a paramedic mentor for West Midlands Ambulance Service (WMAS), posted a picture and wrote on Twitter: ""So upset to be sent this by one of our crews this morning!"" Ms Tudor added that the ambulance was not blocking the road and was in a parking space. ""Is there anything that can be done about this? It's becoming a regular occurrence,"" she tweeted to a number of police accounts. Jon Ireson, another paramedic mentor, wrote: ""Our job is hard enough without having this to come back to as well."" Sharman was charged after the social media plea by West Midlands Ambulance Service staff. A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said: ""We hope that this case will serve as a warning to others that abusing our staff is not acceptable. ""Our staff will only block roads or park in front of drives if absolutely necessary in the interests of patient care. ""In this case, they were parked at the side of the road and were not blocking a driveway. ""We would like to thank the police for their support and swift action in this case, but also to the many thousands of people who have sent us messages of support for our staff and the incredible work that they do saving lives each day."""

The Met Office said a rare North Pole phenomenon called a ""sudden stratospheric warming"" will bring a prolonged spell of cold weather that could last into early March. The event disrupted the polar vortex in the upper atmosphere, resulting in bitterly cold air sweeping in from Siberia, according to forecasters. Next week temperatures are expected to hit 1C or 2C (33F or 35F) for most of the country, and -5C (23F) at night. Sky News weather presenter Joanna Robinson warned that while spring should be approaching, winter was ""far from over"" for the UK. She said: ""There is increasing confidence that easterly winds will develop, dragging in very cold air from Siberia as early as next week. ""This set up is often referred to as the 'Beast from the East'. ""It's not just the UK that will be affected, much of Europe will see temperatures well below average."" Ms Robinson said there is an ""an increasing threat of disruptive snow"", with central, southern and eastern parts of England at risk of heavy snow showers. She added: ""There is some uncertainly on how long the 'Beast from the East' will last and exactly how cold it will get, but at the moment it's looking like spring is on hold.""

2018-02-20,A death row inmate has been granted an 11th hour reprieve for the first time in 11 years in Texas.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180221073918/https://news.sky.com/story/death-row-inmate-who-plotted-own-familys-murder-to-be-handed-reprieve-11259840,"Thomas Bartlett Whitaker, 38, was set to die on Thursday by lethal injection but the Texas Board of Pardons unanimously voted on Tuesday to commute his death sentence. The final decision now lies with Governor Greg Abbott who will approve or deny the recommendation to change his death sentence to life in prison. It marks the first time since 2007 that the Texas board has recommended clemency for a death row inmate. Bart, as he is known to family, was granted the commutation after his father, who was shot in the killing he arranged, pleaded for his son's life to be saved. The death row inmate arranged the murders of his mother, younger brother and father to secure a $1.5m inheritance. He was 23 at the time and promised thousands of dollars to two friends for the killings. His mother, Tricia, and brother, Kevin, 19, were killed in the shooting in 2003. Kent Whitaker, his father, was also shot in the chest and watched his wife and son die, but survived. Mr Whitaker says he forgives his son and petitioned the state to commute his son's sentence from death to life without parole, saying the death penalty should not have been sought during the trial. The highly religious Texan has consistently begged for clemency and broke down in tears when the parole board voted to withdraw the death sentence for his son. Speaking before Tuesday's decision the 69-year-old told Sky News: ""Nobody has to convince me about how bad the crime was because I live with the consequences of his bad choices every day."" But he says his decision to forgive was made even before he knew his son was responsible. He said the prosecution's argument that the death penalty should be carried out in the name of Trisha and Kevin is invalid as it is ""the last thing they would want"". Fred Felcman, the original prosecutor in the case, said the board made its decision purely because of the father's forgiveness and disregarded the large number of others affected by the murders. He said testimony from psychiatrists and the family's investigators who said Bart was manipulative was disregarded. ""I'm trying to figure out why [the board members] think they should commute this, and why the governor should even give it a second thought,"" said Mr Felcman. Mr Whitaker said he would go to the execution on Thursday if Bart is not commuted. He says it haunts his nightmares. ""I have been told what it's like in that room and everyone who has experienced it has told me that I don't want to be there,"" he said. ""I don't want to be there but at the same time I'm not going to let my son die without him knowing that there was someone who really cared about validating him as a human. ""So I'm going to be there, as hard as it is."""
2018-02-20,Researchers have for the first time used a tractor beam to move a levitating object around an obstacle course.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180221073918/https://news.sky.com/story/worlds-most-powerful-tractor-beam-like-a-pair-of-robot-hands-11259395,"Sky News filmed the breakthrough at the University of Bristol, where engineers were able to manoeuvre a polystyrene ball that had been suspended in mid-air by the power of sound. The levitation technique used 256 tiny loudspeakers arranged around a laboratory test rig. The speakers generate ultrasound that’s too high pitched for the human ear to hear. But at 170 decibels (dB), far louder than a jet engine, the sound is powerful enough to lift and manipulate an object. Asier Marzo, an engineer at the University of Bristol, used a standard game controller to move the 1.6mm ball in three dimensions through a series of tubes. He said: “You have seen the particle moving in mid-air. We want to do the same but in your body. “You may have a kidney stone, which is very painful. “The advantage of this technique is that you don’t need to cut the body. “You would apply the ultrasound device from the outside and it would be like an invisible hand that goes inside and moves the stone out.” The levitation technique uses a bank of speakers to create a ""tornado"" of soundwaves, which lift and contain an object within a spinning wall of energy. By switching speakers on and off in sequence the engineers were able to steer the ball with a high degree of accuracy. Star Trek popularised the tractor beam in the 1960s, but it’s taken until now for science to catch up. However, the University of Bristol engineers have their sights on tiny objects rather than alien battleships. Bruce Drinkwater, professor of ultrasonics, said he envisaged contactless production lines, with electronics or medicines being made without any risk of contamination. “You can think of the acoustic manipulator as, an invisible robot,” he said. “It’s like a pair of robot hands, but it’s only a force-field applying the required position, rotation and then moving things into place.” At the power levels used in the lab the technique is safe. An ant made to ""fly"" in the levitation chamber was later able to crawl away apparently unharmed. But to levitate a human the rig would need to be scaled up, with 40,000 speakers producing ten times more sound energy - almost certainly enough to burn skin. For now, some things are best left to science fiction."

Her attendance was kept under wraps until the very last minute. The 91-year-old presented the first ever Queen Elizabeth II Award for British Design to Mr Quinn, who is an emerging talent celebrated for his screen printing. Stylish as ever, she wore a duck egg blue tweed dress and jacket with aquamarine Swarovski crystals from her favourite designer, Angela Kelly, who sat on the other side of Ms Wintour and came up with the idea for the award. The Queen appeared to be enjoying herself as she watched the show, also sitting next to British Fashion Council (BFC) chief, Caroline Rush. She looked slightly bemused at some of the more original displays, including a model wearing a strapless dress and boots wearing a motorbike helmet - all in a yellow, flowery print. Before her FROW debut, the Queen, who wears a hat more often than not, took a tour of an exhibition curated by legendary British milliner Stephen Jones. She looked delighted as she viewed some of the more contemporary hats and fascinators on display and shared a joke with a woman showing her some jewellery on display as part of the exhibition. As part of the new Queen Elizabeth II Award for British Design a designer will be selected by the BFC, in collaboration with the Royal Household, and presented by a member of the Royal Family each year. The award itself was inspired by the Queen Elizabeth Rose, designed by Ms Kelly and made by Lucy Price at Bahinia Studios in Birmingham's jewellery quarter."

It comes amid press allegations the Labour leader passed information to a Czechoslovakian spy in the 1980s, which Mr Corbyn has dismissed as ""ridiculous smears"". Citing ""speculation"" over the politician's activities, the German commission said it was breaking its usual protocol by confirming no records are held on either Mr Corbyn or Labour's shadow home secretary Diane Abbott. Mr Corbyn had previously come under pressure to ask German officials to release any Stasi files that may have been held on him. A focus on the Labour leader's activities in the 1980s has stemmed from initial allegations in The Sun that Mr Corbyn met a communist spy at the height of the Cold War and warned him of a clampdown by British intelligence. Mr Corbyn has admitted meeting a Czech ""diplomat"" for a cup of tea in the House of Commons, but has denied being an agent, asset or informer for any intelligence agency. On Wednesday, the Labour leader demanded an apology and a donation to charity from a Conservative MP who claimed the Labour leader sold British secrets to ""communist spies"". He has also launched a fierce attack on British newspapers over their reporting of the allegations, which Mr Corbyn branded ""increasingly wild and entirely false"". The Labour leader's spokesman said Mr Corbyn recalled meeting a diplomat from Czechoslovakia in 1986 as one of many meetings with ambassadors, politicians, activists and dissidents from ""the majority of countries in the world"". But Mr Corbyn's own diaries contradict the ex-Communist country's secret police files about another meeting in the House of Commons the next year, with the Labour politician recorded as attending a conference in Chesterfield on a Saturday, the spokesman added. He also claimed Mr Corbyn's personal safety is being put at risk by press reporting about him. The spokesman said the case of Finsbury Park terrorist Darren Osborne, who also admitted wanting to target Mr Corbyn, shows ""the serious dangers of the use of language in some of the reporting and the language used by politicians around Jeremy's leadership"". He added: ""The constant repetition both by Government politicians and sections of the press portraying Jeremy Corbyn as a terrorist sympathiser or as in some way an apologist for terror - which is entirely false - has dangers to it which have been quite clearly demonstrated. ""There needs to be an awareness of the dangers of using that kind of language."""

However, despite the positive outcome of antidepressants overall, the study found large variations in the level of efficacy and side effects caused by each pill. The most effective drug was amitriptyline - a drug first discovered in the 1950s. One of the least effective pills was fluoxetine - a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) commonly known as Prozac. Research leader Andrea Cipriani of Oxford University struck a note of caution, warning that antidepressants will not work for everyone. About one third of depressed patients do not respond to such medication. Mr Cipriani added that the findings do not mean that antidepressants should always be the first line of treatment. Other options include talking therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy and counselling. It is hoped that the study, which is published in The Lancet medical journal, will help both doctors and patients to make informed decisions about the best medication to take. Some 300 million people suffer from depression worldwide according to the World Health Organisation, with just one in six people in rich countries getting effective treatment. That figure drops to one in 27 patients in poor and middle-income countries. Recent studies indicate that 10% of British adults now take antidepressants, with these findings suggesting that millions more could benefit from the drugs. Most effective antidepressants: Agomelatine Amitriptyline Escitalopram Mirtazapine Paroxetine Venlafaxine Vortioxetine Least effective antidepressants: Fluoxetine (widely known as Prozac) Fluvoxamine Reboxetine Trazodone"
2018-02-21,More than a million students are expected to be affected by industrial action with lecturers at 64 universities walking out over pensions. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180222081222/https://news.sky.com/story/student-exam-threat-as-university-lecturers-strike-over-pensions-11261281,"Picket lines are expected at campuses around the country after negotiations broke down, with lecturers saying cuts would leave them £10,000 a year worse off in their retirement. Senior lecturer Dr Gregory Lane-Serff is one of those striking at Manchester University. He tells me morale is very low. ""Clearly it's very hard for us to take a decision to go on strike. It's not what any of us come into this business for... but we think universities have a lot of money to fund our pensions. ""They've been taking a lot of money in tuition fees but they've been spending less and less on staff."" Many students are furious they're missing tuition that now costs them up to £9250 a year after fees were trebled five years ago. An estimated 575,000 teaching hours will be lost in the current strike action and some are calling for a refund for missed tuition. One international student at Manchester University says he's saved hard to afford the £18,000 fee for his one year course and he wants to be compensated for lost teaching. Another student who studies healthcare says missing lectures will not only impact her exams but her ability to do the job safely on graduation, as every lecture counts. Universities UK says the pension scheme has a very big deficit of more than £6bn and the cost of future pensions has increased by a third in three years. In a statement it said: ""We can't just ignore this. Without reform, employers and staff would be forced to increase pension contributions to unmanageable levels - an extra £1bn every year."" The University & College Union General Secretary Sally Hunt says they're not pretending there's no issue. ""We need to work out a shared way to fund our scheme so that we deal with the pension deficit together,"" she said. ""It's a healthy scheme and it's not in crisis. We need to find a shared solution, but it takes us to talk and at the moment they're refusing to talk to us."" Many students understand their lecturers' position. Physics student Bethan Turner is even joining lecturers in Manchester on the picket line and is critical of the rising salaries at management level while cuts are made to teaching staff. ""It's management to blame, it's not the staff,"" she said. ""They're refusing to pay pensions, they're refusing to pay staff, what choice do the UCU have?"" The union says how universities react to the strike action this week is key. Any prolonged dispute could significantly impact students as they reach end of year exams."

My friend and I had just arrived at the party, having missed the movie we wanted to watch, and were drinking a couple of beers by the pool. It was painfully similar to every other party in Siem Reap. Then the rain started and we all cowered underneath a small porch. I had no idea that anything going on there could be considered offensive. The police came in. They separated the bulk of the tourists and left the 10 of us separate. :: British man to face trial over 'pornographic dancing' in Cambodia as four others deported:: 'Pornographic dancing' group being extorted by Cambodian authorities, say families They started throwing accusations around and tried to work out who owned the villa – originally blaming me for reasons I still don't understand. Soon, a few of us were in handcuffs and I started having a panic attack and felt the need to throw up. I was let out of my cuffs and they put me on a chair in front of the other people. I was provided a bucket and started to be sick. That was the start of a feeling that wouldn't leave me for two weeks. The next few days were a blur of police officers, translators and forms in a language I had no hope of understanding. Before I knew it I was stood outside a prison, still with no idea why I was there. The only thing we had been told is that we were under investigation and it could take some time. So there started my time in a Cambodian prison. A small cell with 23 other people, a hole in the corner to use for any and all types of sanitation and worst of all no idea how long I would be there for. Allowed out to a courtyard briefly twice a day, I tried to stay strong, helped by my friends, but inevitably had some dark days. This carried on for days, with various glimmers of hope being dashed on what felt like a daily basis. Then we got told to put on ""freestyle"" clothing - something that only happened once before when we were unwillingly put in front of a Cambodian news network - and five of us were pulled from the cell. We got released - into what we weren't told. I still have little to no knowledge about what happened to get me released, but I do know that it in no way stopped my fears. Yes we were out. But did we still face trial? Would I be able to return home? What would my future hold after this wrongful arrest and detention? I am sat, two weeks later, safe at home. But my friend is still there. Stuck. Scared. And now alone. I found that a quick Google search of my name brings up less-than-savoury news articles, and that few news outlets have mentioned that all charges against me have been dropped. I did nothing wrong, but this will affect the rest of my life. Mr Jeffries was not deported from Cambodia and was not charged."

Some 65% of of the savings will be in operating costs and around £350m will be in the consumer division, which will see ""further digitisation"". There will be a further 1,000 roles created by 2020 across three departments, however. The announcement came as the firm reported its full-year results to 31 December, which revealed a 17% fall in group adjusted operating profits to £1.25bn. Centrica's group chief executive Iain Conn described the firm's financial results in the second half of last year as ""weak"", and said that political intervention in the UK energy market was a major factor. Mr Conn said: ""The combination of political and regulatory intervention in the UK energy market, concerns over the loss of energy customers in the UK and the performance issue in North America have created material uncertainty around Centrica and, although we delivered on our financial targets for the year, this resulted in a very poor shareholder experience."" In its results report, Centrica said: ""We believe that price controls in competitive energy markets are not good for customers and evidence shows that where they have been introduced in other markets they have led to reduced competition, less choice, and prices that tend to cluster around the cap."" Between 2016 and 2017, Centrica lost some 10% of its UK home energy customers, going from 14.2 million to 12.8 million. Warmer than normal weather was also blamed for the loss in energy supply accounts. Meanwhile, the company's UK business division saw profits plunge by 92% in adjusted operating profit to just £4m for the year to 31 December. Its UK home branch only managed a 1% rise to £819m, while its North American business unit also saw a drop in profits. Commenting on the overall results, Mr Conn said: ""We regret this deeply and I am determined to restore shareholder value and confidence."" Centrica shares were up 2.5% in early trading."
2018-02-21,"One in every 11 NHS posts in England are currently unfilled, a vacancy rate that regulators say has contributed to one of the most challenging winter periods in NHS history.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180222081222/https://news.sky.com/story/nhs-has-100000-vacancies-as-finances-worsen-11260928,"NHS Improvement's quarterly performance report for the three months to December revealed there are around 100,000 vacancies in England. The regulator said the staff shortage impacted on attempts to keep up with soaring demand that saw 5.6m people visit A&E in the quarter, 250,000 more than in the same period the previous year, and 400,000 patients admitted to hospital in December alone. Despite assurances from the Prime Minister and NHS leaders that planning for this winter was the best-ever, NHS Improvement said A&E activity had been ""higher than planned"", and that Trusts faced difficulties freeing up beds occupied by patients requiring social care. While demand rose, performance against national targets in A&E and for elective surgery declined, as did the financial position of Trusts. The financial performance deteriorated badly, with NHS Trusts now predicting a financial year-end deficit of £931m, £435m more than the planned deficit despite the Government providing £337m more in the Autumn Budget that the Chancellor said would address winter challenges. Agency costs did decline in the quarter but the NHS spent £144m more than anticipated paying non-NHS private providers for healthcare. NHS sources said responsibility for the worsening finances could be laid at the door of just 34 hospitals, but the body that represents Trusts said the report showed NHS staff had been ""pushed to the limit"". ""Despite working at full stretch with around 100,000 vacancies and a real risk of staff burnout, and despite treating six per cent more emergency patients year on year in December, trusts cannot close the gap between what they are being asked to deliver and the funding available,"" said Saffron Cordery of NHS Providers. ""The figures confirm, once again, three key problems the whole NHS provider sector is facing - increases in demand for treatment continue to significantly outstrip increases in NHS funding; trust savings targets remain too ambitious; and there are serious ongoing workforce shortages."" Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the figures were evidence of Government under-funding: ""This Government has overseen a devastating decline in NHS finances and the result is worsening outcomes for patients, with huge staff shortages and treatments cancelled or delayed. ""NHS staff are working round the clock to cope with rising demand but Ministers are failing to give them the resources to do the job."" NHS Improvement chief executive Ian Dalton warned that next winter is not likely to be any easier: ""More people than ever before are going to emergency departments up and down the country at a time when providers are already having to tighten their belts. ""It would be unrealistic to assume the demand which has been building for a number of years is going to reverse."""

Well it has taken her just seven years to reach the day when she might just be able to chalk off one of those goals. She is the favourite to win the NFU presidency in a ballot at their conference in Birmingham on Wednesday afternoon. If she pulls it off she would become the first female president in the organisation's 110-year history. She told Sky News: ""I like to think farming is all about men and women, most businesses have men and women involved in them so I don't see it as any big issue. ""We have got colleges now with many more women coming through wanting to be the farmers of the future. ""But it is not about men and women, it is about both, and having our voices heard."" She farms 300 acres in the picturesque Avon Valley in Wiltshire with cattle, sheep and weddings thrown into the mix in her restored 17th century barns. As co-founder of Ladies in Beef - a group of female beef farmers formed to promote British beef - she was one of the driving forces behind Great British Beef Week and has risen through the ranks of the NFU from grassroots member to her current role of vice president. If she is to take the helm at such a critical time, with Brexit looming, then she is determined to redefine the sector’s relationship with Government. ""There is a clear need for the Government to start taking food seriously,"" she said. ""We are an island nation, 65 million people and growing in a very very volatile world so why would we not be taking food seriously?"" She will continue making those points whether or not she is successful in the ballot - and with so much on her plate she will leave the Grand National to somebody else."

Copying the Vote Leave bus from the EU referendum campaign, the pro-Remain group emblazoned the side of a red bus with the figure before driving the vehicle through Westminster on Wednesday. Although those opposed to Brexit have so far failed to reverse the Leave vote, the bus itself was forced to divert before performing an about-turn after almost becoming stuck down a narrow street. Suggesting leaving the EU could be a literal car crash, Labour MP Chuka Umunna told Sky News at the campaign's launch near Parliament: ""Of course, Boris Johnson said £350m extra per week would go to the NHS if you voted to Leave. ""That is clearly not happening and, in fact, what we know as a matter of fact now that the reality of Brexit is coming into view after that vote, is that actually it is going to cost public services billions of pounds. ""And that is the idea behind this bus."" Mr Umunna said Mr Johnson's Vote Leave bus promising more funds for hospitals after Brexit was ""a big fantasy"", while the slogan on the ""Is It Worth It?"" bus is ""a reality"". The bus will make 33 stops on an eight-day tour of the UK, with the campaign crowdfunded through 700 individuals making an average contribution of £24 each. The side of the bus asks: ""Brexit to cost £2,000m a week says the Government's own report. Is it worth it?"" The figure is based on the Government's own Brexit impact assessment that, according to a leak, suggests leaving the EU - even with a comprehensive free trade agreement with the bloc - will see UK growth 5% lower over the next 15 years compared to current forecasts. The Government have said the analysis does not take into account ministers' desired outcome from the Brexit negotiations. Tom Brake MP, the Liberal Democrats' Brexit spokesperson, told Sky News: ""What we're trying to do is to remind people this is not a done deal. ""People are entitled to have their say on the final deal that the Government strike with the EU. ""The Government's own reports confirm that, whichever deal the Government strike - whether it's a Canada-style deal, a Norway-style deal or, indeed, World Trade Organisation rules - this is bad for every single sector of the UK economy and every single region of the country."""

Stormzy won British male solo artist and British album categories and used his performance to attack Theresa May over the Grenfell Tower fire. In the evening's final performance he rapped: ""Yo Theresa May, where's the money for Grenfell? ""What, you thought we just forgot about Grenfell? You criminals, and you've got the cheek to call us savages, you should do some jail time, you should pay some damages, you should burn your house down and see if you can manage this."" Accepting her award for British female solo artist Dua Lipa thanked ""every single female that has been on this stage before me, that has given girls like me - not just girls in the music industry - but girls in society, a place to be inspired by, to look up and have allowed us to dream this big."" She added: ""Here's to more women on these stages, more women winning awards and more women taking over the world."" Lipa, who also won British Breakthrough artist, was one of many stars on the red carpet carrying a white rose in support of the Time's Up movement. In the most moving moment of the night, the people killed and injured in the Manchester Arena bombing last year were remembered. Ariana Grande had been due to perform, but pulled out through illness. So it was left to Liam Gallagher to lead the tributes with the Oasis song Live Forever. Introducing Gallagher, Take That star Gary Barlow said the victims would ""always live on forever in our hearts, in our minds and in our memories"". Although the night had its serious side, host Jack Whitehall managed to provide some light relief. The Brits has had a somewhat chequered history with presenters, but the comic's turn was generally well received.

Many of those open are currently operating with limited menus or have cut their opening hours. A KFC spokesperson said on Tuesday: ""We anticipate the number of closures will reduce today and over the coming days as our teams work flat out all hours to clear the backlog. ""Each day more deliveries are being made; however, we expect the disruption to some restaurants to continue over the remainder of the week, meaning some will be closed and others operating with a reduced menu or shortened hours."" There's gossip in the hen house, here's the facts... pic.twitter.com/lEuyiOZx2h On Wednesday, the chain attempted to address concerns on Twitter and admitted ""you couldn't make it up"". It cited ""complicated distribution problems"" but insisted it was ""working flat out"" to get all stores up and running. Addressing the issue of the undelivered chicken, KFC said it would ""never compromise of quality"" and that its warehouse had four temperature controlled zones ""like the crystal maze but filled with chicken"". However, it said some chicken would ""inevitably"" go to waste. ""Donating to local charities is one option, and we're looking at many others,"" it added. As for paying its employees, it said while KFC-owned restaurants remained closed salaried employees would be ""paid as normal"" and those paid hourly would be ""paid based on the average hours they've worked over the last 12 weeks"" or are invited to take holiday. The post said franchisees - which account for 80% of KFC outlets - had ""taken time to get advice"". ""Nine out of 10 of our team members will not be worse off this week. Not perfect, but we're ensuring we do everything possible for that remaining 10%,"" it added. ""We need our people now more than ever. Not all heroes wear capes."" The closures sparked panic among bargain bucket buyers and fried chicken fans as police in east London said they received calls from frustrated customers. Tower Hamlets officers tweeted the chicken shortage was ""not a police matter"" and warned people not to waste police time. A Metropolitan Police spokesperson said: ""Tweet was gentle reminder that nuisance calls are not welcome but detract from responses needed for serious calls to police."" Please do not contact us about the #KFCCrisis - it is not a police matter if your favourite eatery is not serving the menu that you desire. Bermondsey MP Neil Coyle said concerned constituents had contacted him over the issue. ""I've been contacted by disappointed #KFC customers on Borough High Street,"" he tweeted on Tuesday. YouTube sensation and fried chicken reviewer Chicken Connoisseur urged those seeking their fix of finger lickin' good chicken to ""keep calm"" on Twitter and purchase fried chicken from ""local independent bossmen"" instead."

UN secretary general Antonio Guterres said the Syrian government's bombing campaign had turned the region into ""hell on earth"" for civilians. ""My appeal to all those involved is for an immediate suspension of all war activities in eastern Ghouta allowing for humanitarian aid to reach all those in need,"" he said. French president Emmanuel Macron has called for a humanitarian truce to allow civilians to be evacuated. Rockets and barrel bombs continued to fall on Wednesday, killing at least 24 people, in an apparent preparation for a government ground assault. The UN has described the situation as ""beyond imagination"", while Amnesty International said ""flagrant war crimes"" were being committed. Bilal Abu Salah, who lives in the eastern Ghouta town of Douma, said: ""We are waiting our turn to die. This is the only thing I can say.""

""People have not only been suffering a cruel siege for the past six years, they are now trapped in a daily barrage of attacks that are deliberately killing and maiming them, and that constitute flagrant war crimes."" The Syrian government maintains it is fighting a war on terrorism and does not target civilians. State media reported that rebels have been firing mortars on districts of Damascus near eastern Ghouta, killing at least six people on Tuesday and wounding two people on Wednesday. A spokesman for Russia's Defence Ministry said there had been a ""massive bombardment by illegal armed groups from eastern Ghouta"" which had targeted residential areas, hotels and Russia's Centre for Syrian Reconciliation. The UN has called for a ceasefire, saying the situation for civilians in eastern Ghouta is ""spiralling out of control"". It has warned the violence could turn into a repeat of the battle for Aleppo, which endured months of conflict between rebels and government forces in 2016. Eastern Ghouta was among the first Syrian regions to shake off government rule after popular demonstrations against President Assad swept through the country in 2011, eventually leading to civil war. It is also among the last places to resist Assad's determined campaign to take back control of every last rebel-held region. It is supposed to be one of the ""de-escalation zones"" agreed by Russia, Iran and Turkey as part of their diplomatic efforts. But a former al Qaeda affiliate, which has a small presence there, is not included in the agreement. The bombardment of eastern Ghouta by Assad's forces resulted in the worst 48-hour death toll in Syria since a chemical attack in 2013. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 106 civilians, including 19 children, were killed in the violence on Tuesday. It came after 127 people were killed on Monday in eastern Ghouta's bloodiest day in four years. The Observatory blamed Russian warplanes, saying Moscow carried out its first strikes in three months on eastern Ghouta. In another development, Assad's forces were sent to the northern Afrin region, where they came under fire by Turkish forces attacking the Kurdish-controlled area. Syria is sending in forces to come to the aid of a Kurdish militia known as the YPG, after Turkey and its Free Syrian Army allies made unexpected gains there. A spokesman for Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said there would be ""serious consequences"" after a convoy of about 50 vehicles tried to enter Afrin on Tuesday but were repelled by artillery fire."
2018-02-21,Archaeologists have long wondered how the ancient Egyptians aligned the corners of the pyramids of Giza along the cardinal points so accurately.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180222081222/https://news.sky.com/story/mystery-behind-the-giza-pyramids-near-perfect-alignment-possibly-unravelled-11260435,"But now an electrical engineer with an interest in archaeology thinks he has the answer. The near-perfect alignment along the four points of the compass might be the result of the ancient Egyptians using the autumn equinox - when the Earth's equator passes through the centre of the Sun's disk. Glen Dash, an amateur archaeologist, has published a paper in The Journal of Ancient Egyptian Architecture that tries to explain the impressive accuracy of this ancient feat of engineering. The Great Pyramid, only 0.067 degrees counter-clockwise from perfect cardinal alignment, could have been achieved by tracking the point of a shadow at regular intervals on the day of the autumn equinox. To prove this theory, Mr Dash made his own experiment using a tall rod, commonly known as a gnomon, and a piece of string. On the day of the equinox, he placed the rod in the ground, marked the tips of the shadows and formed a smooth curve of points. He then intercepted a couple of the points on the curve and was able to draw a line running almost perfectly east to west. Although Mr Dash's experiment was conducted in Pomfret, Connecticut, the engineer believes that, on a clear and sunny day, the same thing should work in Egypt. He argues that the Egyptians may have used the same technique to build Pharaoh Khufu’s iconic pyramids because the degree of error measured in the experiment was slightly counter-clockwise, just like the slight error found in the alignment of the 4,500-year-old monuments in Giza. :: Mysterious void discovered in Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt :: 4,400-year-old tomb of Egyptian priestess found Although the paper offers a possible explanation for the long-standing mystery of how the Giza pyramids were aligned so accurately, nothing is certain. ""The Egyptians, unfortunately, left us few clues,"" Mr Dash wrote. ""No engineering documents or architectural plans have been found that give technical explanations demonstrating how the ancient Egyptians aligned any of their temples or pyramids."" Some archaeologists have argued that the Egyptians used the pole star, while others say they used the sun's shadow to align the pyramids. It is even possible, says Mr Dash, that the ancient civilisation used multiple methods."

There was also a £901m hit from changes to US corporate tax laws made by President Donald Trump in December. The bank said it had set aside £1.2bn for litigation and conduct, including £700m for payment protection insurance, also known as PPI. The bank's chief executive Jes Staley described 2017 as a ""year of considerable strategic progress"". He said: ""We have already started to see some of the benefits of our work in 2017. ""Group profit before tax increased 10% year-on-year as a result of our team's focus on execution. ""Although we are only seven weeks into the first quarter, and it is too early to offer formal guidance, we are pleased with the start to the year, and in particular in the markets businesses in CIB (corporate investment banking)."" Barclays posted an attributed loss of £1.9bn for the year against a profit of £1.6bn in 2016 after taking a previously announced £1.2bn writedown from the sale of Barclays Africa Group. The bank also said that uncertainty and increased market volatility following the UK's vote to leave the European Union was ""likely to continue until the exact nature of the future trading relationship with the EU becomes clear"". Potential risks include increased likelihood of a recession, sparking lower growth, higher unemployment and falling house prices; changes to EU passporting rights; and more difficulty recruiting and retaining talented staff, the bank said. Barclays bosses said after the results were posted that the bank would take a £127m hit in its fourth quarter, largely related to the failure of Carillion. The outsourcing firm collapsed last month, leaving a number of British banks exposed due to unpaid loans. Barclays shares were up 5.8% in early trading."
2018-02-21,"Henry Bolton became leader 142 days ago. And for 142 days in the sun, he has lost, more or less everything.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180222081222/https://news.sky.com/story/whither-ousted-ukip-leader-henry-bolton-11255778,"He has lost his wife, his family, his day job and today he lost the leadership of the party which had thrust him into the spotlight. When he became leader, 142 days ago, I was in the hall in Torquay. I remember that he was elected on a promise to professionalise the party. When I asked him, a few days ago, how that was going, he could only wince. Instead of professionalisation, his leadership has seen the party sink to new lows of infighting and humiliation. After the revelations of his mistress Jo Marney's racism, he received a unanimous vote of no confidence in his leadership from the party's National Executive Committee. Since then he has experienced the undoing of his private life and intense media scrutiny, which he compared to me as akin to that endured by Princess Diana. He hoped he could survive. Going into the make or break meeting, I was told that he had good reason to be hopeful. Nigel Farage had backed him; he had coachloads of supporters being brought in and he had apparently re-geared the race into a referendum on the unpopular NEC. Yet in the end, it wasn't even close. What happened? The media were banned from the meeting itself but sources who were inside tell me that to some extent, Mr Bolton lost it on the day. He made a bellicose speech which barely mentioned the allegations against him. He appeared ""arrogant"" and ""without contrition"". He launched a blistering attack on the NEC which he slammed as: ""The enemy within. The only loyalty these people have is to themselves. Their actions are despicable."" Mr Bolton's opponents were equally unforgiving. Sources tell me that Steve Crowther, former acting leader, speaking on behalf of the NEC, was scathing, ""going hard on Bolton lying to his family and wife"". Mr Crowther said: ""It is not that he has done wrong but that he refuses to accept that he has done wrong. ""It is not about the morality of what he has done but his political judgement. He has developed a reputation for being unreachable and always late. He is also a liar."" He then accused Mr Bolton of telling untruths about his CV. Up to then the forces seemed evenly balanced, with both sides being booed and heckled. The game-changer came when Paul Oakley, general-secretary of the party, addressed the crowd and revealed that Mr Bolton had only days before threatened to try and stop the Emergency General Meeting with legal action. In his right of reply, Mr Bolton did not deny this but indeed threatened it again. This did not go down well with the undecided voters. Threatening to sue your own party is not a good look. At that moment a source texted me: ""He's a goner."" The meeting was bitter and nasty but the rebels succeeded and Mr Bolton is gone. But for how much longer? On Thursday, Mr Bolton confirmed to me that he ""had three options"" if he lost. Today he confirmed to me that he was considering running for leader again. He said: ""You can't keep a good man down. You certainly haven't heard the last of me in politics."" He might well run again, there is nothing to prohibit him from doing so under the party's rules. He received 37% of the no-confidence vote. Under the UKIP's First Past the Post electoral system, he need not get a majority of the votes in a leadership contest, just one more than the second placed candidate. Talking to those in the hall, he clearly has supporters who would rally to his cause again. Senior UKIP figures are disparaging of the prospect. Welsh leader Neil Hamilton told me ""that he might well run, as he's shown he's no stranger to humiliation"". Gerard Batten, the interim leader, said that if he is thinking about it Mr Bolton should ""get a life"". But as a senior UKIP source told me: ""He might well do it, because he's lost everything else."" He is chasing the dying of the light. Whatever happens to Mr Bolton, his is a sorry tale but UKIP's story could be sorrier still. It is now on its seventh leader in 18 months. It faces the prospect of another leadership election which it cannot afford. It heads into a set of local elections where it is defending hundreds of seats, with no permanent leader. There are even rumours that its great hero Mr Farage - his spell over the apparently party broken - might set up a new party with former donor Aaron Banks. One woman will be relieved: Theresa May. The hardest proponents of the hardest Brexit are off the battlefield. That gives her breathing space on her Eurosceptic flank. In the end, UKIP have simply lost their reason to be. Like Del Boy after he finally became a millionaire, now their lifetime ambition of Brexit has been achieved, they just do not quite know quite what to do with themselves. The sticking plaster, which bound this disparate band of libertarians, social conservatives, economic protectionists, working class socialists and shire Tories together, has been ripped off. There's not much left. UKIP have been written off before. But in Birmingham, the stench of death is everywhere. As one source texted me as we all headed for home: ""Dead within a year, I reckon."""

There is a degree of uncertainty at this stage in terms of forecasts, but we can expect temperatures next week to plunge across most of Britain. Sky weather producer Chris England said negative double figures are possible overnight in some places, and it will struggle to rise above freezing during the day. ""There is also a risk of some significant snow, as wintry showers feed in across the south, especially on Monday,"" he explained. He added there are some indications that the flow will become more northerly later, so it may not be quite as cold ""Interestingly, the stratosphere has warmed significantly above the North Pole, an event known as sudden stratospheric warming, which is linked with low temperatures and cold easterly winds across the UK."" On Tuesday, Sky weather producer Joanna Robinson warned winter was ""far from over"" for the UK, even though spring should be approaching. She said: ""There is increasing confidence that easterly winds will develop, dragging in very cold air from Siberia as early as next week. ""This set up is often referred to as the 'Beast from the East'. ""It's not just the UK that will be affected, much of Europe will see temperatures well below average. ""There is some uncertainly on how long the 'Beast from the East' will last and exactly how cold it will get, but at the moment it's looking like spring is on hold.""

2018-02-21,"The Prime Minister has ordered a review of public health scandals involving the pregnancy test drug Primodos, the use of vaginal mesh implants and the anti-epilepsy drug sodium valproate.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180222081222/https://news.sky.com/story/pm-orders-review-into-primodos-vaginal-mesh-and-epilepsy-drug-11260421,"Former Conservative health minister Baroness Cumberlege will lead an examination of the circumstances in all three cases and consider whether there are grounds for wider inquiries into the failings alleged by campaigners. Sky News last year exposed a cover-up of the impacts of Primodos, a German drug prescribed as a pregnancy test that campaigners say was responsible for causing miscarriages and abnormalities including babies born with missing limbs, brain damage and heart defects. Research by the manufacturers acknowledged there was a one-in-five chance of birth defects, but the evidence was concealed to frustrate claimants. Sky News has also been reporting on the impact of vaginal mesh implants for more than two years, drawing attention to women left in acute pain by the procedure, used to treat incontinence and prolapse since the 1990s. Thousands of women are suffering complications from a ""quick-fix"" routine operation to cure stress urinary incontinence. Women have been left in chronic pain, some unable to walk, work or have sex. The official complication rate set by the medical regulator the MHRA is 1-3%, but Sky News revealed how NHS data shows the figure to be almost 10%. The mesh is made out of polypropylene plastic and designed to be permanent so removing it is a highly dangerous operation. Last year the use of mesh was heavily restricted in Australia and banned in New Zealand, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has recommended its use be suspended in the UK. Sodium valproate is an anti-epilepsy drug that has also been linked to birth defects in cases where it was prescribed to expectant mothers without a warning as to the potential consequences. Documents uncovered by Sky News from the National Archive last year revealed that the dangers to pregnant women were kept from patients for decades despite evidence it could harm foetuses. In all three cases, campaigners believe the Government response has been inadequate and have called for full inquiries. At Prime Minister's Questions, Theresa May said she had been affected by ""powerful stories"" from campaigners that had highlighted ""an issue with our regulatory and healthcare system"", ""We are determined to address it"", said the PM. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt later admitted that patients had at times been let down: ""We must acknowledge that the response to these issues from those in positions of authority has not always been good enough,"" he told the Commons. The Health Secretary ruled out a blanket ban on vaginal mesh and also said he had ""every confidence"" in Baroness Cumberlege to lead the review after some MPs questioned her appointment. Kath Sansom, from campaign group Sling the Mesh, said she was ""thrilled"" the review had been ordered but added that ""many women's and families' lives have been shattered by medical devices and drugs that were never tested on humans before being released en masse to women globally""."
2018-02-21,"As staff at more than 60 universities kick off a wave of strike action over proposed changes to pensions, one student fears her education could be compromised and another says students should stand in solidarity with lecturers.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180222081222/https://news.sky.com/story/compensation-v-solidarity-students-argue-for-and-against-university-strikes-11259446,"Georgia Davies, 21, who studies English and modern history at the University of St Andrews calls for students to be compensated. This week, strikes will begin at universities across the UK, affecting thousands of students and reducing their contact time and access to university facilities. My opposition is in the way that university students – time and time again – are being cheated by a system which is systematically unfair. For the 12 hours a week of contact time I receive, I pay a total of £9,250 a year – not including the exorbitant living costs, extra materials and travel to and from my home. The limited library resources, space and even assistance from admin staff means that value for money is poor at best, horrendous at worse. With the strikes, I will miss out on key learning; putting the nail in the coffin for this education being value for money, or even worth the price tag. Now students are facing a situation which means they will miss out on over half of their contact time. I am personally missing six tutorials, six key hours which are essential to my essays, exams and general understanding of the subject. To divide my (minimum) of six hours of contact time missed – discounting any potential library visits – I will lose out on £200 worth of contact hours (at £32 an hour, worked out by dividing £9,250 by time spent at university premises, with some lee-way for admin costs and use of office hours). Ultimately, compensation would be ideal. It would be the only fair solution to the issue of missed contact time, exorbitant debt and poor value for money that the university experience offers to an arts student. However, it is important to note that this should not be a fight between students and lecturers. It is the lecturers themselves who, at my university, have encouraged students to seek compensation. They have supported many students in their mission to get value for money from the universities. Like students, the lecturers are being presented with a situation which is unfair and fraudulent. We have both been slapped with ""terms and conditions"" that were not made clear – and indeed have changed – when we first applied to be at this university. The ultimate answer, to us, is clear: Work to negotiate a solution with the lecturers and stop taking advantage of students because you think they can't fight back. Amelia Horgan, 25, a philosophy PhD candidate at the University of Essex and a postgraduate representative on the National Union of Students' National Executive Council, says students should stand in solidarity with their lecturers. Academic staff across more than 60 universities are going on strike to resist devastating changes to their pensions. It's the longest industrial action in the University and College Union's (UCU) history and it's vital that we stand in solidarity with them. As workers they deserve decent pensions and working conditions and any attack on those conditions is also an attack on the quality of education that students receive. The proposed changes to pensions are deeply unjust. If they go ahead, lecturers will lose up to £200,000 each with early career staff the most affected. While missing out on classes isn't the situation that students would prefer, the disruption caused by the strike is nothing compared to the damage caused by years of cuts and increased fees. Education should be free - it is a public good that should be accessible to all. We can't fight for free education without also demanding that the rights of education workers are respected. Students angry about hugely expensive fees and exploitative rents are part of the same fight as striking lecturers, and we must show support for our lecturers against the Government and Universities UK who would much rather see us divided. It is clear that the current funding model for universities is unsustainable, only free education paid for through progressive taxation can deliver the sustainable and long-term funding the sector desperately needs. The NUS postgraduate campaign is asking students to conform to that tired stereotype and stay in bed in front of Netflix on strike days, or better still, join picket lines, showing solidarity with lecturers who are resisting the same forces of neoliberalisation that raised student fees."

He said he had planned to share the snack among colleagues, and offered to replace the tin, but was hauled before the Directorate of Professional Standards. The second allegation related to a speeding ticket he asked to be withdrawn, when he was transporting a male patient from a mental health unit to the station. On Wednesday, the disciplinary panel found he had no case to answer in either charges. In the three-day hearing, the then inspector Sarah Blake argued that even though he had offered to replace them: ""By that time the biscuits had been eaten and, in my mind, theft is theft.

It comes after Mr Hammond said in November he would ""investigate how the tax system and charges on single-use plastic items can reduce waste"". Ms Creagh spoke of the ""public concern around the impact of plastic pollution on our environment"" and put it to the minister that ""it is now three months since that announcement"". The letter demands clarity on when any possible consultation will take place, how long it could run for and whether it would be the Treasury or Defra who would carry it out. ""Pollution from single use plastic packaging is choking our oceans and devastating marine wildlife,"" said Ms Creagh. ""Three months ago ministers promised to look at using the tax system reduce the use of throwaway plastics, but still have not published a call for evidence. ""The Government has talked the talk on plastics pollution, but it has been too slow to walk the walk."" In his Budget, Chancellor Philip Hammond described plastic waste as a ""scourge"" and said he was looking into a single-use plastic tax. In January, Theresa May set out plans to get rid of avoidable plastic waste within 25 years. The Prime Minister said she wanted to ""make ours the first generation to leave the natural environment in a better state than we found it"" as she unveiled her Environmental Plan. She said plastic was ""one of the great environmental scourges of our time""."

The UK's counter-terror apparatus is of huge benefit to Europe - the security advantages are too important for EU countries to lose. It works both ways, mind. Britain benefits from the sharing of data connected to known criminals or terrorists in Europe. On Friday, the Heads of MI6, France's DGSE and Germany's BND came together to call for an agreement that will allow this exchange of information to continue post-Brexit. Largely speaking, everyone's on the same side here. But this was a speech for two audiences - the lofty collection of world leaders in the hall itself, and her party back home in Britain. At home lies a potential hurdle. Her pledge to ""respect"" the rules of the European Court of Justice won't go down well with Brexiteers. If May wants Britain to remain a within Europol or a stay part of the European Arrest Warrant, then it's hard to see how she can negotiate that and not be in some part under the jurisdiction of the ECJ. That's a battle she'll have to win another day. Today, May's speech did nothing to win Europe round to Brexit. It did little to convince the international sceptics that Britain isn't in retreat. But it did get a gentle nod of approval from Brussels. She'll take that."

The annual profit compares to a £7bn loss for the year before - which was the latest in a succession of losses going back to the financial crisis, adding up to £58bn. RBS remains more than 70% owned by the taxpayer after its £45bn bail-out by the Government during the crisis. The bank's toxic legacy continues to weigh heavily, with a potential fine from the US Department of Justice (DoJ) over the mis-selling of mortgage-backed financial products in the offing. It warned that this was among legal and regulatory issues that may result in ""substantial additional charges and costs"" over coming quarters. Meanwhile there was a warning that this year would see a hit to costs as RBS accelerates its transformation, ramping up restructuring charges by more than £1bn. RBS said the resolution of the DoJ case will be a ""key milestone"" as it seeks to start paying out dividends to long-suffering investors as soon as possible. The bank had looked on course to post yet another annual loss for 2017, had the case reached a likely multibillion-pound settlement in time for the latest results. Instead, it will continue to haunt RBS this year. Chief executive Ross McEwan said settling the case - which dates back to the run-up to the financial crisis - was the ""one major legacy issue that we have yet to resolve"" and that the timing of this was not in its control. Mr McEwan hailed the transformation of RBS into a ""simpler, safer and more customer-focused bank"" and its progress in ""putting the past behind us"". That effort included putting aside a further £764m of litigation and conduct costs in the fourth quarter of 2017, including £175m added to the bill for the mis-selling of payment protection insurance (PPI) in the UK and £135m for ""legacy issues"" including tracker mortgages in the Republic of Ireland. It also included a £442m provision to add to the bank's war chest over mortgage-backed securities in the US - the issue which has been pursued by the DoJ as well as other American authorities. RBS now has £3.2bn set aside to cover costs arising from the scandal, in addition to the £4bn it has previously paid to the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Some analysts have predicted the DoJ fine could be higher than £5bn. The bank has also been in the spotlight recently with the release of a report on its controversial treatment of small business customers in the past. Mr McEwan said the lender accepted it had ""got a lot wrong"" but that he welcomed the City watchdog's findings that the most serious allegations against it had not been upheld. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the return to profit was ""a stay of execution rather than a pardon"" with the US fine likely to hit profits for 2018. He added: ""All in all, it's been a tricky but momentous year for RBS, in which the bank has put to bed many of the legacy issues which have hampered performance since the financial crisis."""

He remains in custody on suspicion of two counts of murder and one count of grievous bodily harm. The arrest comes after the deaths of Abdikarim Hassan and Sadiq Aadam Mohamed, who were found less than a mile apart on Tuesday. Mr Hassan, 17, who came to the the UK from Somalia when he was two years old, was pronounced dead when officers arrived in Bartholomew Road in the Kentish Town area of Camden at about 8.30pm. Police believe he was attacked nearby before managing to stagger out into Bartholomew Road. His uncle, Yusuf Ahmed, said he was a ""good guy"" who was ""always smiling"" and enjoyed playing football with his friends as well as helping his mother. And his aunt, Fatima Deria, speaking on behalf of his mother, said: ""She said she came here for their safety, to flee from home. But he's not safe, is he? He's dead. This is where he lost his life, not back home."" Less than two hours later, at 10.15pm, officers responded to another call on Malden Road - a short bus ride away from where the first attack took place - after neighbours heard ""a lot of screaming"" outside. There they found Mr Mohamed, 20, with serious stab wounds. He was also pronounced dead at the scene, and it is believed he and his friend were chased by four men. His friend escaped uninjured and the suspects fled along Malden Road towards Prince of Wales Road. The deaths came after an earlier stabbing in the borough at about 8pm. Officers on patrol were pursuing a silver Mercedes in Eversholt Street when a member of the public alerted them to an incident outside a block of flats in nearby Aldenham Street. There they found a 16-year-old boy who had been stabbed, and he continues to recover from non-life threatening injuries at a local hospital. Police are continuing to appeal for witnesses - or anyone who may have useful information - to come forward. :: 'I stabbed him six times' - Gang member on life with a knife Detective Chief Inspector Paul Considine, leading the investigation, said: ""What is clear is that there were three violent attacks, by a group of men armed with knives, within about two hours of each other and within about a mile of each other. ""I need the public's help to establish the exact circumstances in which two young men were murdered and another seriously injured, and to identify the people responsible. ""Today, I am asking local residents or those people who were out in the area that night to think back - and if they saw something that may help us, please get in contact. ""I can understand why some people may be reluctant or nervous about coming forward but we need your help. We will treat your information in the strictest of confidence."" :: Fatal stabbings at highest level since start of decade He added: ""I also believe that there are people out there who knows exactly who is responsible. I would urge you to do the right thing and tell us what you know. It is not too late. ""Two families are suffering a terrible loss, and you could hold the answers to what happened to their sons, brothers, loved ones, best friends."" The deaths came just two nights after a fatal stabbing in west London. Police found Lewis Blackman, 19, of Camden, with knife wounds at about 3.20am on Sunday. Mayor Sadiq Khan has been under pressure to do more to combat deadly knife crime in London, as have the courts, with a top Scotland Yard officer calling for tougher sentences and better rehabilitation to stop youngsters from reoffending. A number of murder probes have been launched into fatal stabbings since then and Detective Chief Inspector Considine said the frequency of fatal stabbings in the capital was ""shocking"". He continued: ""We all have a part to play in preventing this. If you know something about these murders then please do your part in helping us with this investigation. ""One line of enquiry that we are urgently pursuing is that a blue van was seen in the area of the two murders. ""If you saw a vehicle that caused you concern due to how it was being driven or the people inside it then please get in touch with us."" :: Anyone with any information is asked to contact the investigation team on 020 8345 3734, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
2018-02-22,"A bill could be passed on Friday which would make it an offence to attack service animals, including police dogs and horses.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180223135010/https://news.sky.com/story/finns-law-mps-to-decide-whether-attacking-police-dogs-should-be-criminal-offence-11263253,"The Service Animals Offences Bill will have its second reading following the Finn's Law campaign. PC Dave Wardell and his police dog Finn were chasing a robbery suspect in 2016 when they were attacked with a knife. The suspect injured PC Wardell's hand, but he stabbed Finn in the head and chest as the German Shepherd tried to stop him from getting away. While the suspect was charged with actual bodily harm for his injuries to PC Dave Wardell, he was only charged with criminal damage for almost killing Finn, as dogs are considered property in the eyes of the law. Criminal damage is currently the only available charge for someone who attacks a police or service animal - even though dogs are often bitten, kicked and strangled while in the line of duty. Parliament could reach a decision on Friday on whether to make attacking a service animal a specific criminal offence. PC Wardell got Finn when he was a puppy at nine months old, and they have worked together ever since. He has told Sky News about the experience, which saw both him and Finn, who is now eight, suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). ""I first realised he had a knife when I saw it coming out of Finn's chest, "" he said. ""We thought it was a baton. Finn blocked the knife when it was coming towards me. If he hadn't done that I wouldn't be here today. He is my hero."" Finn was very badly injured and rushed to the vet. ""I wasn't sure I'd get him to the van without him dying, it was a huge knife. We were in the van with the blue lights on so he was excited - he thought we were going out for a new job! ""Then when we got there I could tell he was really suffering because he just laid there and he never does that."" PC Wardell spoke of a moment that he would never forget. ""I was laying there with him on the floor at the vet. In all that pain he sniffed out the cut on my hand and started tending to it. That will stay with me forever."" PC Wardell says coping with PTSD has been made easier with Finn's support, who also suffers the effects of traumatic experiences he faces on the job. ""Since that night Finn went from being my service to my therapy dog - my recovery has been linked to his recovery. I really struggled. ""The guilt was horrendous. The flashbacks kept me awake for weeks."" He says there is ""no doubt"" Finn suffered from PTSD as well because he was ""so withdrawn and not himself"". But he pulled them both through. ""It was Finn that dragged me through that first job and said 'come on dad, let's go back to work'"". PC Wardell says a law change would honour the amazing role service animals play in society, helping people live safer lives. ""If we are going to put them in dangerous positions then the least we can do is protect them."" Finn has been responsible for 300 arrests, but in his spare time he likes to go swimming, surfing and paddle boarding."

Both boys died after being taken to hospital, and a black Ford Focus with a smashed front windscreen and front right side was found abandoned a short time after the crash. West Midlands Police have arrested a 53-year-old man and a 41-year-old woman, who are being held on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and drink driving. The brothers' grandfather, Kim May, who placed a football alongside other tributes at the scene of the incident on MacDonald Road on Friday morning, said they were ""happy, lovely boys"". ""I just don't know what to say, it's just crazy,"" he said. ""The boys were the heart and soul, the boys were lovely, they'd do anything. They were just very happy, go-jolly, lovely boys and their lives have been taken away so young. It's unbelievable. ""Corey was a very, very gifted footballer at a young age. Casper, he was like any two-year-old, he was just lovely. Corey, he loved his football, he played every Saturday."" Mr May, who was accompanied at the scene by his sister and the boys' aunt, witnessed the aftermath of the incident, which he described as an ""absolute nightmare"". Neighbour Avtar Chagger described hearing a thud from the collision and ran from his home office to try and help. He told Sky News: ""I straightaway saw the bodies and I straightaway called the police and ambulance. ""A doctor had got off the bus and was helping the six-year-old. With the phone in my hand I walked to the second child, I held his nose and blew into his mouth several times and then the police and ambulance arrived. ""The family was crossing the road, the cousins and nephews. It was hell out there, people crying and screaming."" Both boys were taken to hospital with severe injuries. Casper could not be revived and died a short time later. Corey died despite having surgery. Chelsea Platt-May, the boys' aunt, told Sky News that they had been on the way to a family day out at the park. ""We were all in a row crossing the road, doing our usual checks, double checks, we were all bubbling to go to the park,"" she said. It wasn't until we were about half-way that we noticed that there was a car right next to Corey, and then there was a sound of crushing plastic and the screeching of tyres. ""In that moment of hearing crushing plastic we all froze and it wasn't until we heard a scream that we knew something was wrong. ""I hope - it sounds horrible to say - they didn't suffer and I hope they were going with happy thoughts and not thoughts of pain."" Family and friends have launched a number of fundraising pages to help the grieving parents, with one having already received more than £3,000 in donations. Lauren Dooley, 25, who runs a local accounting firm, said: ""I understand that there is help towards funeral costs for children already, however this does not cover all costs. ""The money will be used for flowers and any other costs that may occur."" In addition to the successful page set up by Ms Dooley, two others have each raised more than £1,500. Investigating Detective Sergeant Paul Hughes said: ""Several witnesses have come forward and I am grateful to everyone who has spoken to us. ""Specialist family liaison officers are with the family, who are understandably distraught, and they are being kept fully updated. ""This collision has had a profound effect on the community in Stoke and I would ask people not to speculate on what happened which may cause further distress to the family. ""They need our combined support to help them through this dreadful time."""

The UK's counter-terror apparatus is of huge benefit to Europe - the security advantages are too important for EU countries to lose. It works both ways, mind. Britain benefits from the sharing of data connected to known criminals or terrorists in Europe. On Friday, the Heads of MI6, France's DGSE and Germany's BND came together to call for an agreement that will allow this exchange of information to continue post-Brexit. Largely speaking, everyone's on the same side here. But this was a speech for two audiences - the lofty collection of world leaders in the hall itself, and her party back home in Britain. At home lies a potential hurdle. Her pledge to ""respect"" the rules of the European Court of Justice won't go down well with Brexiteers. If May wants Britain to remain a within Europol or a stay part of the European Arrest Warrant, then it's hard to see how she can negotiate that and not be in some part under the jurisdiction of the ECJ. That's a battle she'll have to win another day. Today, May's speech did nothing to win Europe round to Brexit. It did little to convince the international sceptics that Britain isn't in retreat. But it did get a gentle nod of approval from Brussels. She'll take that."

Mr Peterson's actions were caught on video during the massacre, and he has now resigned after being suspended without pay and placed under investigation. The massacre on Valentine's Day was the second-deadliest shooting ever at a US school. Nikolas Cruz, a 19-year-old former student, was later arrested and charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder. :: Pictured: 17 victims gunned down in school massacre :: A-list stars donate millions to Florida shooting victims amid gun control protests According to the sheriff, Mr Peterson took up a position viewing one of the entrances to the school for more than four minutes after the shooting started, but he ""never went in"". Asked what the deputy should have done, Mr Israel said he should have ""went in, addressed the killer, killed the killer"". He added: ""(I am) devastated, sick to my stomach. There are no words. I mean these families lost their children. We lost coaches. I've been to the funerals. ... I've been to the vigils. It's just, ah, there are no words."" Two other deputies have also been placed on restrictive jobs for not acting on 23 calls sent to the sheriff's department during the past several years. Meanwhile, more than 1,000 people have gathered to remember a 37-year-old assistant football coach and security guard who died while helping students to safety. Aaron Feis was remembered as a loyal friend and a hero during an emotional funeral service which saw some of his players being pallbearers. They dressed in black and maroon jerseys and came to the front of the church where 17 candles - one in honour of every victim - lined the back of the stage. Teachers were due to return to the school on Friday, but officials have confirmed that the building where the shooting happened is going to be torn down. ""Our new normal has yet to be defined, but we want to get back to it,"" geography teacher Ernest Rospierski said. It plans to reintroduce classes on 28 February. Gun control campaigners have redoubled calls for bans or further restrictions on assault rifles including a video narrated by campaigner and actress Julianne Moore."
2018-02-22,Executives at housebuilder Persimmon have agreed to £51m worth of cuts to their bonuses after an outcry over the expected bonanza.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180223135010/https://news.sky.com/story/persimmon-bosses-agree-51m-cuts-to-bonuses-after-outcry-11263339,"The construction giant has come under increasing pressure over the plans which would have seen chief executive Jeff Fairburn receive £100m via a share option scheme. He will now take £25m less, while the £78m value of a bonus for finance director Mike Killoran will be cut by £24m and managing director Dave Jenkinson has agreed to a cut of £2m to £38m. Persimmon has come under persistent pressure after the value of the executives' bonuses was seen to have been inflated by the Government's Help To Buy scheme. That intervention to help the housing market came in 2013 – after the company's long-term bonus plan, had been devised in 2012 – and pushed up the value of the shares to be awarded. Persimmon's chairman Nicholas Wrigley resigned over the issue in December amid growing shareholder anger. Earlier this month, Mr Fairburn said he would set up a charitable trust to donate a ""substantial proportion"" of his windfall to good causes. But pressure on the company increased when the company's sixth largest shareholder, Aberdeen Standard Investments, this week described Mr Fairburn's bonus as ""grossly excessive"" and said it remained a ""huge concern"". Persimmon has now announced, days ahead of its final results, that the three executives had decided to accept reduced payouts. The company maintained that the bonus scheme, backed by more than four-fifths of investors when it was set up, had been a key factor in its ""outstanding performance"". But it acknowledged that the absence of a cap on the scheme had ""given rise to the potential for pay-outs which, when triggered in full, will be significantly larger and paid earlier than might reasonably have been expected at the time the scheme was originally put to shareholders""."

He was pronounced dead at 7.05pm on Thursday at Florida State Prison. The 47-year-old was executed for the 1993 rape and fatal beating of University of West Florida student Susan Morris. The 21-year-old's naked body was found buried in a shallow grave near a nature trail. ""She had been beaten, stomped, sexually assaulted and strangled. She bore numerous bruises and lacerations, both eyes were swollen shut,"" judges who rejected one of Branch's previous appeals at the Florida Supreme Court had noted. Court records also showed he was convicted of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl in Indiana and of another sexual assault in the Florida Panhandle that took place just 10 days before the college student was brutally killed for her car. His murder trial jury recommended the death penalty by a 10-2 vote under Florida's old capital punishment system, which was ruled unconstitutional by the US Supreme Court years later because jurors had failed to reach a unanimous decision. Florida legislators subsequently changed the system to comply. Asked later whether Branch's outburst could have been caused by the execution drugs, Department of Corrections spokeswoman Michelle Glady said ""there was no indication"" that the inmate's last actions were a result of the injection procedure. This was confirmed by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, she added. The college student's family said afterwards in a statement: ""Twenty-five years ago, Susan's life was suddenly and brutally extinguished. ""We have grieved for her longer that she was with us. Yet because of who she was ... she will never be forgotten by those who love her."" Meanwhile, 38-year-old Thomas ""Bart"" Whitaker, who hired a gunman to kill his mother and brother at their Houston home had his death sentence commuted, less than an hour before he was set to be executed. The last-minute reprieve - from Texas governor Greg Abbott, a Republican - came after the death row inmate's father who survived the 2003 attack pleaded with the state to grant clemency. The execution of Doyle Lee Hamm for the 1987 death of a motel clerk during a robbery was postponed in Alabama after the inmate argued there was a risk of a botched execution because of damage to his veins from lymphoma and other illnesses. The US Supreme Court delayed the execution to consider Hamm's appeal, later giving it the go-ahead. However, it left officials with little time to prepare him for the execution and his death warrant expired at midnight."
2018-02-22,MPs are set to discuss a bill which would introduce a national 'opt-out' system for organ donation in England.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180223135010/https://news.sky.com/story/mps-to-debate-legislation-to-bring-in-opt-out-organ-donation-11262626,"A private member's bill presented by Labour MP Geoffrey Robinson - so-called 'deemed consent' legislation - would make people automatic organ donors, unless they actively chose not to participate in the system. The bill needs the support of 100 MPs. ""It's a big social change, it's a big moral change,"" Mr Robinson told Sky News. ""But opting out will be very, very easy - if you don't want to be in the scheme you just have to say so. Why is it so important? Because there are 500 lives a year the NHS believes it could save if there were organs available to use."" One of those whose lives could be transformed by the change is 30-year-old Jessica Harris, a type 1 diabetic whose kidneys are failing, and who is currently awaiting a kidney and pancreas transplant. ""At the moment, I'm not driving, I'm not able to travel, to work, I get so tired,"" she said. ""On days that aren't good, just brushing my hair, hanging laundry - I feel I've run a marathon."" Jessica has been on the donor list for five months - but in the meantime has to undertake her own complicated dialysis treatment at home every morning and evening, to flush out the toxins her kidneys now can't. She lives with a bag packed and ready, in the hope that a call about a new kidney may come at any time - but says a change in the system might make that happen much faster. :: Sky Views: Should non-donors be given an organ? ""If the law's brought in, it would be life changing for me,"" she says. ""You're still able to opt out if you don't want to go through donating your organs, but for someone like me whose life is completely on hold it would just be amazing."" Health minister Jackie Doyle-Price said the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) will be supporting the bill at its Second Reading ""and are working closely with Geoffrey Robinson to ensure it delivers"". The department is also carrying out a public consultation on the issue of 'deemed consent' organ donation - which closes on 6 March. ""We want as many people as possible to have their say on a future system that will save many more lives,"" said Ms Doyle-Price - emphasising that although they have had more than 12,000 responses to their online form, they are keen to hear more from the African, Caribbean or black British communities in particular. DHSC says that's because people from black and Asian backgrounds wait, on average, six months longer than a white patient for a kidney transplant - and only 6% of the total number of donations from dead people in 2016/17 came from the BAME Community, even though they make up 29% of the waiting list. :: Girl, 13, helped save a record eight lives after donating her organs Mr Robinson's bill has the support of the Prime Minister and all seven major UK parties, as well as charities including Kidney Care UK, the British Lung Foundation and the British Heart Foundation - though some warn the switch would require big changes in the NHS. ""The Health Service has got to make sure it's geared up for this effect,"" warned Simon Gillespie, chief executive of the British Heart Foundation. ""Staff need to be briefed; they need to understand the new system; they need to offer the opportunities for people often at very, very difficult times when they've just lost a loved one. ""And there are impacts also in terms of the facilities available, to make sure we can conduct more transplants."" A similar opt-out system is already in place in Wales and more people there are now consenting to donate their organs, up from 58% in 2011/12 to 64% in 2016/7. But the number of donors has not actually increased since the law changed in December 2015, and the number of transplants also decreased in 2016/17. Experts say this may be because it's still too early to judge the impact, but also because there may have been fewer eligible donors over that period."
2018-02-22,"There are more than 230 million errors in administering medication in the NHS each year, new figures show.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180223135010/https://news.sky.com/story/more-than-1700-nhs-deaths-from-errors-in-administering-medicines-11262848,"The research, commissioned by the Department of Health and Social Care, also shows medication errors may be responsible for about 1,700 deaths a year. It is a problem which costs the NHS an estimated £1.6bn. Despite the high numbers, those behind the study say the vast majority of errors do not affect the patient and are spotted beforehand. Study author Rachel Elliott, a professor of health economics at the University of Manchester, said: ""In a perfect system there would be no errors. But there are no systems, particularly those involving humans, where there are no errors. ""As far as we're concerned this information is actually very useful. I would say people shouldn't be worried, most prescribers, and pharmacists and nurses are aware of the risks associated with medicines and are very vigilant at all stages. ""Unfortunately, systems are not perfect and therefore errors do occur. Most of the errors we've picked up in this 237 million are not going to affect the patient - are not going to even reach the patient."" Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt will today announce plans to reduce patient harm and improve safety relating to medication errors. In a speech at the Global Patient Safety summit in London, Mr Hunt will say: ""My mission has always been to make the NHS one of the safest healthcare systems - and although we do well in international comparisons, this new study shows medication error in the NHS and globally is a far bigger problem than generally recognised, causing appalling levels of harm and death that are totally preventable. ""We are taking a number of steps today, but part of the change needs also to be cultural: moving from a blame culture to a learning culture so doctors and nurses are supported to be open about mistakes rather than cover them up for fear of losing their job."" The Government's plans include accelerating the introduction of electronic-prescribing systems across the NHS - essentially robots replacing humans when selecting medication - to cut down on errors. New systems will also be introduced linking prescribing data in primary care to hospital admissions to allow the NHS to see if a prescription was the likely cause of a patient being admitted to hospital. There will also be new defences for pharmacists if they make accidental mistakes when administering medication, rather than being prosecuted, to ensure the NHS can learn from errors. Andrew Iddles' mother Mabel was rushed to hospital in 2014 at the age of 102 after falling at home. During her time in hospital she was mistakenly given medication meant for a patient in the bed next door - including an insulin injection. Mr Iddles said, fortunately, the nurse responsible raised the issue quickly. He said: ""It is not easy to detect and, if a patient is not diabetic, a hefty dose of insulin could lower the blood sugar to a fatal level... thus it was very important that the nurse had the courage to admit her mistake straight away so no harm came to my mother."" Many are not so lucky - with the report finding medication errors may contribute to up to 22,000 deaths a year. The British Medical Association has welcomed the plans outlined by the Government, but says more help for GP practices is also needed. A BMA spokesperson said: ""GP practices are facing increasing demand on their services, with patients presenting with increasingly complex health problems, so the Government needs to continue to work with us to establish a workforce strategy including enabling practices to expand their multi-disciplinary team to help meet patients' needs."""

They added that no arrests have been made and enquiries are ongoing. Earlier, the force said the package was delivered to the palace on Monday and only revealed it contained a ""substance"". However, an updated statement on Thursday evening said: ""Police are investigating after a package containing a substance was delivered to St James's Palace on Monday, 12 February. ""Officers are also investigating an allegation of malicious communications which relates to the same package, and it is being treated as a racist hate crime."" Police are believed to be examining whether the incident was linked to a package containing white powder sent to Parliament a day later, according to the Evening Standard. St James's Palace, which is very near to Buckingham Palace, is home to several members of the Royal Family and their household offices, including the Princess Royal, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie and Princess Alexandra, the Queen's first cousin. It is situated about two miles from Kensington Palace, where Prince Harry and Ms Markle live. Prince Harry first confirmed his relationship with the American actress, who is mixed-race, in November 2016 by issuing a strongly-worded statement about media harassment and racism against her on social media. The statement from his press secretary, Jason Knauf, said: ""The past week has seen a line crossed. ""His girlfriend, Meghan Markle, has been subject to a wave of abuse and harassment. ""Some of this has been very public - the smear on the front page of a national newspaper; the racial undertones of comment pieces; and the outright sexism and racism of social media trolls and web article comments. ""Some of it has been hidden from the public - the nightly legal battles to keep defamatory stories out of papers; her mother having to struggle past photographers in order to get to her front door; the attempts of reporters and photographers to gain illegal entry to her home and the calls to police that followed; the substantial bribes offered by papers to her ex-boyfriend; the bombardment of nearly every friend, co-worker, and loved one in her life."" He said Prince Harry was ""worried about Ms Markle's safety and is deeply disappointed that he has not been able to protect her."""

2018-02-22,An ejector seat maker has been fined £1.1m for a health and safety breach which resulted in the death of a Red Arrows pilot.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180223135010/https://news.sky.com/story/ejector-seat-maker-fined-11m-for-red-arrows-pilot-death-11263545,"Flight Lieutenant Sean Cunningham, an experienced flyer, was ejected from his Hawk T1 aircraft while conducting pre-flight checks on the ground at RAF Scampton, Lincolnshire, on 8 November 2011. The parachute on the ejector seat did not deploy and the South African-born airman died in hospital. Martin-Baker Aircraft Company Ltd admitted failing to ensure the safety of non-employees in connection with the 35-year-old's death at a hearing on 22 January. At Lincoln Crown Court on Friday, the firm was handed a £1.1m fine and had already agreed to pay £550,000 in prosecution costs. Handing the company the fine, Mrs Justice Carr said: ""Flight Lieutenant Cunningham was a fit and professional trained pilot with a promising future ahead of him. ""A significant number of pilots, and also potential passengers, were exposed to the risk of harm over a lengthy period. ""Here the risk of harm was of the highest level - death. Martin-Baker Aircraft Company fell short of the appropriate standard."" She added: ""This was, in the words of his father, an entirely preventable tragedy."" On the first day of the two-day sentencing hearing at the beginning of February, prosecutor Rex Tedd said the company had a duty to ""ensure none of the pilots"" were exposed to a health and safety risk. He said: ""If the pilot was ejected from the Hawk aircraft, two shackles would not release from one another and would jam together and the main parachute would not deploy. ""The pilot would be several hundred feet in the air and there could only be one result of that, and that is the pilot's death."" The firm describes itself on its website as the ""world's leading manufacturer of ejection and crashworthy seats"". In the submissions made by the defence, the judge was told the company's sadness and regret was enormous. Richard Matthews, defending, said: ""The company accepts its responsibility for the significant contribution it has made in the death of Lieutenant Cunningham. ""Nobody can convey the sadness and regret on behalf of the company and all those who stand behind it. I know you will accept that it is enormous."" Martin-Baker Aircraft Company Ltd has said in a statement: ""Our thoughts remain foremost with the family and friends of Flight Lieutenant Sean Cunningham, to whom the Company conveys its sadness, regret and apology. ""This tragic accident was the result of an inadvertent ejection and main parachute deployment failure due to the over-tightening of the drogue shackle bolt."" It says the company accepted a breach of the Health & Safety At Work Act 1974 ""on the basis that it failed to provide a written warning to the RAF not to over-tighten the drogue shackle bolt."" ""Martin-Baker has designed and manufactured ejection seats for 73 years and in that time they have been flown by 92 air forces. Our seats have saved the lives of 1,050 RAF and Royal Navy aircrew with a further 6,510 aircrew lives saved around the world. ""We appreciate that both the Judge and the Health & Safety Executive, during this process, has acknowledged our dedication and track record in saving lives."""

He underwent surgery to remove his prostate and 11 lymph nodes before Christmas after being diagnosed following a full health check-up by his doctor, who he had booked an appointment with to receive a flu jab. Surgery is said to have gone well, with doctors telling him: ""It's all been got."" For the last 2 months I've been in the throes of a rather unwelcome and unexpected adventure.

The former QI presenter - who stepped down from his BAFTA hosting role last month - said his health was the reason he had retreated from the public eye in recent months.

2018-02-22,Judges have turned down an appeal bid against a decision to stop life support for brain-damaged baby Isaiah Haastrup.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180223135010/https://news.sky.com/story/isaiah-haastrup-judges-deny-parents-appeal-over-decision-to-withdraw-life-support-11263158,"Last month, the High Court gave doctors permission to stop treatment for the one-year-old, against his parents' wishes. Specialists at King's College Hospital in London said giving further intensive care was ""futile, burdensome and not in his best interests"", and suggested only palliative care. The Court of Appeal has now upheld that decision and denied his parents permission to appeal. Isaiah's father, Lanre Haastrup, has been banned from visiting his son at London's King's College Hospital and on Thursday also lost an appeal to have that overturned. Speaking after the decision, he said the hospital ""should be ashamed of themselves - the way they've treated us"". ""How can you ban me from seeing my son despite having a judgment in there to kill him - for him to die. ""It's really sad - it's a sad day - where are we going in this country that a father has been banned with no criminal act?"" Mr Haastrup told reporters he believed the judges had ""got it wrong"" by not hearing evidence over treatment for his son, who he says is still responsive. ""We haven't heard what experts have to say about this treatment,"" he added. ""What their lordships should have done is at least hear from the experts who will come and examine Isaiah and then make a decision from that. ""All they've done is read some peer-reviewed articles and then said 'no, it's not going to work'. It's really sad."" Isaiah's father said the hospital had not told them when Isaiah's life support would be switched off, but that the family was planning an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights. ""They should wait and see what we do next - they shouldn't rush to kill him - to end his life,"" said Mr Haastrup. Isaiah suffered serious brain damage due to being deprived of oxygen at birth. Lawyers for King's College Hospital have said he is in a low level of consciousness and cannot move or breathe independently. Doctors also say Isaiah does not respond to stimulation - a claim his parents reject. His mother, Takesha Thomas, previously told judges: ""When I speak to him he will respond, slowly, by opening one eye. ""I see a child who is injured. He needs love. He needs care. I have it. I can give it. To say it is so poor, it is not worth living, that is not right. It is not their decision to make."""
2018-02-22,"Theresa May is facing the prospect of another Commons Brexit battle, just hours after a marathon gathering of senior ministers aimed at agreeing a united front on leaving the European Union.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180223135010/https://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-faces-prospect-of-fresh-commons-brexit-showdown-11263136,"The eight-hour session of the Brexit ""war Cabinet"" at the Prime Minister's country retreat of Chequers was called to thrash out of a common position for the next phase of negotiations with Brussels. Speaking on Friday, Environment Secretary Michael Gove described the meeting as ""very good"", adding: ""We agreed on the way forward."" The comment was echoed by Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who said: ""We all got behind the Prime Minister and we've agreed the basis for her speech for next week and I'm looking forward to it going ahead."" Health and Social Care Secretary Jeremy Hunt - who was not at Chequers - said he had been told it was ""positive and constructive"". He added that the PM's top team agreed there will be areas of the economy - such as the automotive sector - where Britain will align itself with European regulations and others where it will diverge. ""But that must always be on a voluntary basis,"" he told Sky News. ""It won't be the situation that the EU changes their rules and we have to follow suit, it will be on the basis of agreement between two sovereign powers, the UK and the EU, and then we'll have an independent arbitration system where there's any disagreement."" But amid professions of Cabinet unity, another parliamentary clash on Europe - and a test of the PM's authority - is on the horizon. A number of pro-EU Conservative and Labour backbenchers have tabled an amendment to the Government's trade bill, which would require the UK to form a customs union after Brexit. Leading rebel and Tory MP Anna Soubry said she had support across the House for the amendment and called on Labour to back it ""in the national interest"". The party's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry has said Labour now backs a post-exit customs union that would look ""pretty much like"" the current one, meaning the Government could very well be defeated if the amendment is put to a vote. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is expected to give his backing to a customs union arrangement with the EU in a major Brexit speech on Monday. The customs union amendment will provoke the ire of Brexiteers, who argue maintaining a customs union with the EU would restrict Britain's room for manoeuvre when negotiating free trade deals and is akin to not leaving the EU at all. Brexit-supporting Conservative MP Michael Fabricant described the amendment as a ""total betrayal"" of Leave voters. ""It will stop us controlling our own borders and prevent us from having an independent trade policy,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""It will result in #Brexit in name, but not in reality."" Speaking to the BBC, Mr Hunt rejected the customs union calls and said it was possible to have ""frictionless"" trade with the continent without one. Meanwhile, Downing Street has dismissed reports Mrs May is readying for a u-turn on the rights of EU migrants who come to Britain during the Brexit transition period. The PM's spokesman said her position that the rights of EU nationals arriving after the date of Brexit in March 2019 would be different from those arriving before that date had not changed. Mrs May will set out her confirmed strategy for the next phase of Brexit negotiations in a speech next Friday, following on from a meeting of her full Cabinet expected to take place on Tuesday. Before the Chequers talks had even begun, Mrs May saw the European Commission appear to reject her ""three baskets"" approach to future UK-EU regulatory cooperation. The PM had previously suggested Britain could harmonise with existing EU regulations in some industries, align with EU rules but with different methods in others and diverge significantly in certain sectors."

As a result, easterly winds will develop, spreading cold air from western Russia towards the UK. Temperatures there are as low as -23C (-9F). The Beast from the East will lash Europe with a long freezing snap in the coming days as a rare sudden stratospheric warming takes effect.

They will also strengthen, bringing a significant wind chill, so it will feel colder than the temperatures suggest. Most places are likely to remain dry, but snow showers are expected, which may lead to disruption to travel for the start of the week. Exact locations for the snow and how much will accumulate is still a little uncertain at this stage, but early warnings have been issued by the Met Office for Monday and Tuesday. On Monday, the southeast of England has a yellow warning as later in the day snow showers may accumulate there. There is a wider yellow warning for snow across most of the east of the UK on Tuesday. Up to 10cm of the white stuff is possible on both days, even down to low levels, but some areas may only have a couple of centimetres or even nothing at all. The bitterly cold conditions will be a shock to the system for many, especially as the start of this week was mild, with temperatures reaching 14.2C (57.6F) in Cardiff - the highest temperature of the month. However, there have been indications of this happening in the long-range forecast since late January and more recently we have also seen a big jump in temperatures in the stratosphere, at around 30km above the North Pole. This is known as ""sudden stratospheric warming"", which is a breakdown of the usual high-altitude westerly winds. More often than not this leads to a change in wind direction to cold easterlies for the UK."

Authorities said a police officer died in hospital after the confrontations. He had suffered cardiac arrest. Police said a Russian man was injured but the extent of his injuries was not immediately disclosed. Fans from both clubs were reportedly involved in the clashes which erupted ahead of the round-of-32 match in the second-tiered European club competition. Police were escorting some Spartak fans into the stadium but a stray group allegedly started lighting fireworks and throwing flares and objects toward Athletic supporters and officers. The fighting spread on to the streets near the stadium. Stones were thrown at police, who set off flares to push back crowds. Many fans were seen trying to run away from the trouble as fireworks exploded all around. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy offered his condolences to the family of the policeman who died and condemned the violence. In a statement, UEFA said it ""strongly condemns the violent clashes which occurred in Bilbao. We are in contact with local authorities to obtain further information on these incidents"". More than 500 police officers were deployed ahead of the game to try and prevent fan trouble. Police made a number of arrests as the violence and injuries escalated. ""Five people have been arrested. We do not know if they are all supporters of Spartak, but many of them are Russians,"" a regional police spokesman said. Russia is hosting the World Cup from 14 June and authorities are putting strict security procedures in place to try to prevent violence. Six years ago, a fan died in Bilbao in clashes after a match between Athletic and German club Schalke. After the violence in Bilbao, the Europa League match went ahead and ended 2-1 to Spartak Moscow, but Athletic Bilbao went through 4-3 on aggregate."

2018-02-22,"Grooming gangs that preyed on 700 girls and vulnerable young women carried out their abuse with ""arrogant persistence"", a review has found.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180223135010/https://news.sky.com/story/newcastle-gangs-abused-adults-and-children-with-arrogant-persistence-review-finds-11263201,"Perpetrators were not consistently investigated and so effectively went unpunished before a major operation into sexual exploitation in Newcastle was launched to stop them. Prior to 2014, there was little understanding of the widespread sexual abuse in deprived areas of Newcastle and Gateshead. The 150-page report said: ""This sent an unhelpful message to perpetrators - they were unlikely to be prosecuted or prevented from continuing to abuse - encouraging an arrogant persistence. ""It also had a significant impact on victims who learnt that nothing would be done against perpetrators."" In Christmas 2013, a 21-year-old woman with a learning disability began to speak to her social worker about being subjected to sexual abuse over a considerable period of time. With some encouragement, the victim gave a statement to police identifying places she had been taken. From here, it emerged that this young woman was one of hundreds of victims - sounding alarm bells with local authorities and the police. According to the report's author, adults were vulnerable to abuse as well as children - and there was no difference in how both were targeted for sexual exploitation. Instead, it is about vulnerability. Many of the victims did not realise they were victims for years. ""One of them gave a quite chilling account,"" said report author David Spicer, as he described why one victim chose to talk about her experiences. ""Young girls were coming straight from school in school uniforms with school bags. And that was a trigger for her that she realised what was happening shouldn't be happening."" The report examines sexual exploitation in Newcastle between 2007 and 2015. Operation Sanctuary was the largest sex abuse investigation carried out by Northumbria Police and resulted in hundreds of arrests with more than 700 potential victims coming forward. Four trials at Newcastle Crown Court heard how vulnerable girls were groomed by men who gave them alcohol and drugs before raping them at parties. At the final trial, 17 men and one woman were convicted of charges including rape, supplying drugs and inciting prostitution. The report author invited all of those convicted to be interviewed in his review. Only one agreed. ""There was a complete lack of remorse,"" said Mr Spicer, who cannot identify which abuser he interviewed. ""In fact he didn't accept that he'd done anything wrong... He felt the victims were responsible for their own abuse."" The report continued: ""If convicted for rape in his home country, he would be beheaded or buried up to the neck and stoned. ""He was asked about what he thought about the United Kingdom and influences in his education. ""He said you can get anything here - any sex, drugs, alcohol. There is no control. He spoke in a derogatory way about lack of morals in British girls and did not go with Muslim girls because there are not many of them."" This review was unable to establish a true understanding of the offending carried out by perpetrators. Northumbria Police were revealed to have paid a convicted child rapist £10,000 to inform on sexual predators in Operation Sanctuary. The tactic was heavily criticised, but the review says it sends a message to perpetrators that people will inform against them. Acting Chief Constable Darren Best said: ""We will use all available lawful and proportional tactics to tackle abuse and we make no apologies for doing that... there's a fine line we have to tread with the public's best interests at heart."" The abuse of children does not stop when they reach 18 and learning to identify adult victims is a challenge for authorities. Some women even have children with their abusers and are too frightened to come forward. The leader of Newcastle City Council, Pat Ritchie, is urging all local authorities to look at this report: ""The way that these men prey on women and girls is seeing vulnerability. ""This sort of a crime is one that is based on fear and exploitation of people who are vulnerable and by its nature the sort of relationship at the heart of this sort of crime is controlling, it's threatening, it's very difficult to break out of the cycle that these women were in. And they're frightened."" Among its recommendations the report calls on the Government to urgently issue guidance or advice on addressing the sexual exploitation of vulnerable adults. The review's message to agencies is if they do not recognise sexual exploitation of children and vulnerable adults in their area, it is because they are not looking hard enough."

He added that such a move could prove to be easier once Britain has left the European Union. Mr Gove said: ""There is some concern that EU laws mean that we can't ban straws at the moment, but I'm doing everything I can to ensure that we eliminate this scourge and I hope to make an announcement shortly."" According to the Marine Conservation Society, an estimated 8.5 billion straws are used in Britain every year, with plastic straws one of the most common items found during beach clean-ups. The comments from the Environment Secretary come after it was revealed the number of straws bought by Parliament had doubled in the last three years. Mr Gove is one of a number of Conservative MPs who have pledged to cut down on their use of plastic during Lent. He has also recently been pictured holding a disposable coffee cup in a bid to burnish his - and by extension the Tories' - environmental credentials. Writing in the Evening Standard recently, Mr Gove highlighted how an ""overwhelming majority"" of plastic straws ""end up in landfill or clogging up our rivers and oceans."" ""As a symbol of society's damaging addiction to single-use plastics and our throwaway culture, straws are hard to beat. If they did not exist, there would be scant reason to invent them,"" he said. Campaigners say single-use straws take more than 200 years to break down. Some high-profile companies have started to phase them out, with the likes of JD Wetherspoon, Wagamama, Costa Coffee, Pizza Express and Waitrose either taking steps to stop using them or offering them on request only. Prime Minister Theresa May pledged last month to eliminate all avoidable plastic waste within 25 years, an action plan which included encouraging supermarkets to bring in plastic-free aisles. The Government has already taken action to ban the use of plastic microbeads to reduce plastic pollution getting into the world's oceans. :: Sky's Ocean Rescue campaign encourages people to reduce their single-use plastics.

He is understood to have been on his honeymoon with his wife Ellie Milward at the time. She remains critically injured in hospital, along with Jennifer Barham, 39, and pilot Scott Booth, 42. More than £21,000 has been raised for Mr Udall and Ms Milward through a JustGiving crowdfunding webpage. Chris Tucker, who set up the page, wrote on Thursday: ""It is with a very heavy heart that I must type this. ""Our good friend Jon Udall has succumbed to his injuries. ""He was strong, brave and I will never forget him. I will update this page when possible. Ellie is critical and is continuing to fight."" Becky Dobson, 27, her boyfriend Stuart Hill, 30, and his brother Jason Hill, 32, also died when an Airbus EC130 B4 came down in Arizona. Mohave County Medical Examiner's Office said the three, who are originally from Worthing in West Sussex, died from multiple injuries. The group had been celebrating Stuart Hill's 30th birthday with a holiday in Las Vegas. The helicopter crashed in a section of the Grand Canyon outside of the national park where air tours are not as thoroughly regulated. The aircraft, operated by Papillon Grand Canyon Helicopters, came down in a rocky wash while approaching landing pads at Quartermaster Canyon after flying from Boulder City, Nevada. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the cause of the crash. An NTSB preliminary report released two days ago said the helicopter made at least two 360-degree turns before crashing. ""Subsequently, the helicopter made at least two 360-degree left turn revolutions as it descended into the wash below where it impacted terrain and a post-crash fire ensued,"" it said. A full NTSB report will not be done for more than a year."
2018-02-22,"Henry Bolton became leader 142 days ago. And for 142 days in the sun, he has lost, more or less everything.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180223135010/https://news.sky.com/story/whither-ousted-ukip-leader-henry-bolton-11255778,"He has lost his wife, his family, his day job and today he lost the leadership of the party which had thrust him into the spotlight. When he became leader, 142 days ago, I was in the hall in Torquay. I remember that he was elected on a promise to professionalise the party. When I asked him, a few days ago, how that was going, he could only wince. Instead of professionalisation, his leadership has seen the party sink to new lows of infighting and humiliation. After the revelations of his mistress Jo Marney's racism, he received a unanimous vote of no confidence in his leadership from the party's National Executive Committee. Since then he has experienced the undoing of his private life and intense media scrutiny, which he compared to me as akin to that endured by Princess Diana. He hoped he could survive. Going into the make or break meeting, I was told that he had good reason to be hopeful. Nigel Farage had backed him; he had coachloads of supporters being brought in and he had apparently re-geared the race into a referendum on the unpopular NEC. Yet in the end, it wasn't even close. What happened? The media were banned from the meeting itself but sources who were inside tell me that to some extent, Mr Bolton lost it on the day. He made a bellicose speech which barely mentioned the allegations against him. He appeared ""arrogant"" and ""without contrition"". He launched a blistering attack on the NEC which he slammed as: ""The enemy within. The only loyalty these people have is to themselves. Their actions are despicable."" Mr Bolton's opponents were equally unforgiving. Sources tell me that Steve Crowther, former acting leader, speaking on behalf of the NEC, was scathing, ""going hard on Bolton lying to his family and wife"". Mr Crowther said: ""It is not that he has done wrong but that he refuses to accept that he has done wrong. ""It is not about the morality of what he has done but his political judgement. He has developed a reputation for being unreachable and always late. He is also a liar."" He then accused Mr Bolton of telling untruths about his CV. Up to then the forces seemed evenly balanced, with both sides being booed and heckled. The game-changer came when Paul Oakley, general-secretary of the party, addressed the crowd and revealed that Mr Bolton had only days before threatened to try and stop the Emergency General Meeting with legal action. In his right of reply, Mr Bolton did not deny this but indeed threatened it again. This did not go down well with the undecided voters. Threatening to sue your own party is not a good look. At that moment a source texted me: ""He's a goner."" The meeting was bitter and nasty but the rebels succeeded and Mr Bolton is gone. But for how much longer? On Thursday, Mr Bolton confirmed to me that he ""had three options"" if he lost. Today he confirmed to me that he was considering running for leader again. He said: ""You can't keep a good man down. You certainly haven't heard the last of me in politics."" He might well run again, there is nothing to prohibit him from doing so under the party's rules. He received 37% of the no-confidence vote. Under the UKIP's First Past the Post electoral system, he need not get a majority of the votes in a leadership contest, just one more than the second placed candidate. Talking to those in the hall, he clearly has supporters who would rally to his cause again. Senior UKIP figures are disparaging of the prospect. Welsh leader Neil Hamilton told me ""that he might well run, as he's shown he's no stranger to humiliation"". Gerard Batten, the interim leader, said that if he is thinking about it Mr Bolton should ""get a life"". But as a senior UKIP source told me: ""He might well do it, because he's lost everything else."" He is chasing the dying of the light. Whatever happens to Mr Bolton, his is a sorry tale but UKIP's story could be sorrier still. It is now on its seventh leader in 18 months. It faces the prospect of another leadership election which it cannot afford. It heads into a set of local elections where it is defending hundreds of seats, with no permanent leader. There are even rumours that its great hero Mr Farage - his spell over the apparently party broken - might set up a new party with former donor Aaron Banks. One woman will be relieved: Theresa May. The hardest proponents of the hardest Brexit are off the battlefield. That gives her breathing space on her Eurosceptic flank. In the end, UKIP have simply lost their reason to be. Like Del Boy after he finally became a millionaire, now their lifetime ambition of Brexit has been achieved, they just do not quite know quite what to do with themselves. The sticking plaster, which bound this disparate band of libertarians, social conservatives, economic protectionists, working class socialists and shire Tories together, has been ripped off. There's not much left. UKIP have been written off before. But in Birmingham, the stench of death is everywhere. As one source texted me as we all headed for home: ""Dead within a year, I reckon."""
2018-02-22,The UK's workforce is being urged to take a proper lunch break and leave on time this Friday as a report claims staff lost £31bn in unpaid overtime last year.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180223135010/https://news.sky.com/story/workers-lost-31bn-in-free-overtime-during-2017-tuc-11262346,"The study by the TUC, to coincide with its Work Your Proper Hours Day, accuses employers of an ""over-reliance"" on the generosity of their workers. Using figures from the Office for National Statistics, the union organisation calculated almost five million people worked an average 7.4 hours a week without pay during 2017 - worth an average of £6,265 per worker. That sum meant they had effectively worked for free so far this year up until Friday, the report found, a time when household budgets have been damaged by inflation outpacing wage growth. It said public sector employees accounted for 25% of total workers but produced almost 40% of all unpaid overtime. While chief executives were found to be the biggest losers, the report found teachers and other learning professionals were the next group to do the most outside their usual hours. Amid fierce debate more widely on gender pay, there was almost no difference between men and women with almost 20% of both sexes doing free overtime. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""Lots of us are willing to put in a bit of extra time when it's needed, but it's a problem if it happens all the time. ""So today we're saying to workers, make sure you take a proper lunch break and go home on time. ""We're asking managers to leave on time too. Good bosses know that a long-hours culture doesn't get good results, and the best way to lead is by example."" Unison released a more angry response to the findings - saying they showed the pressure staff had been under following years of pay restraint following the financial crisis. The union's assistant general secretary, Christina McAnea, said: ""Public sector staff regularly work through their breaks and go home late, because they're dedicated to the patients, students and local people who rely on them. ""But expecting employees to work above and beyond the call of duty, day in day out, is simply not on. ""With staffing shortages and wages failing to rise with the cost of living, morale in our public services is already at rock bottom. Overstretched and under-appreciated staff are at risk of burning out or giving up on a career in the public sector altogether. ""While managers need to ensure that staff work their proper hours, the government needs to give public sector workers the decent pay rise they all deserve."""
2018-02-24,"South Africa is grappling with an ecological disaster after billions of tiny plastic pellets, called nurdles, spilled into the sea when a container fell from a ship in the port of Durban.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180224143141/https://news.sky.com/story/south-africas-ecological-nightmare-after-plastic-pellets-spill-11264554,"They have now been washed up along 1,200km of coastline and are causing a huge threat to areas rich in wildlife. Here is John Spark's report from South Africa: Some people call them ""high density plastic'"" or ""pre-production micro-plastic"" but individuals in the industry refer to them as nurdles - a silly sounding name for a lentil-sized pellet that is the building block of all-known plastic products. Your plastic bag from the supermarket? It's made from nurdles. Your daughter's dolly with the clip-on earrings and shoes? They are all moulded from nurdles. Every single day, nurdles are shipped around the world in their billions and billions - just like any other cargo. But nurdles are not ""any other cargo"" - a fact the people of South Africa are now learning to their detriment. A major spill of these translucent pellets in the city of Durban has spread along 2,000 kilometres of coastline, proving virtually impossible to clean up - and the threat posed to marine and birdlife is incalculable, say leading environmentalists. They may be small in size but their synthetic legacy that could last forever. Back in October, a freak hurricane bore down on Durban, ripping ships from their moorings and causing chaos in the port. Propelled by wind power, two vessels belonging to the logistics-giant Mediterranean Shipping Company collided within the port's confines and containers holding 49 tonnes of nurdles went over the side. Five days after the storm, local residents noticed that millions of plastic nurdles were washing up on beaches. People started to call the regional environmental agency to complain but it was already too late - billions of these plastic pieces had already flowed out of the channel which leads to the sea. Sobantu Tilayi, who is the chief operating officer of South Africa's Maritime Safety Authority, told us that the consequences of the spill came as a shock. ""We all work under standard operating procedures and we know what do when there is oil or explosives (but) nobody could tell what to do with nurdles. We didn't even know these things behave like this."" By behaviour, he means speed of movement. According to figures provided by NGO Wild Oceans, nurdles packed into two containers which fell off the MSC Susanna have now moved as far north as the border with Mozambique and all the way south to Cape Town. For hundreds of clean-up crews now charged with scrapping them off the coastline, it is the ultimate environmental nightmare. We watched several hundred people tackle a stretch of coast line north of Durban near a place called Mtunzini and we soon noticed that the sand, pools and marsh lands were saturated with them. As soon as one person tried to scoop half-a-dozen or so up, they were replaced by another gaggle of slippery, silvery pellets. The clean-up operation benefits from a highly-capable leader. Captain Nicolas Sloane, who helps run an organisation called Resolve Marine, is the man who righted the Costa Concordia back in 2013 - but this nurdle crisis is a real test. ""We clean up one beach. It looks perfect (then) we have a spring tide, the sand migrates and blow me down, there they are again. It is not easy, and you cannot get despondent. We are recovering product."" But there is a long, long way to go. Of the 49 tonnes which spilt in the water, only 11 tonnes have been recovered - 23% of the total - and realistically, much of it will never be retrieved. For environmentalists like Dr Andrew Venter, it is an unmitigated disaster. ""We could be cleaning up in two or three years' time and we still won't recover all 49 tonnes of that particular load. It's not going to happen."" The repercussions for marine and bird life could be disastrous he says with multiple species misjudging toxin absorbing nurdles for food. ""From an environmental perspective, it is worse than an oil spill because (nurdles) won't break down. They last forever."" Dr Venter admits he had never heard of nurdles until last October but they pose a problem that he - as well as government officials, shipping executives, their insurers and the South African public at large - will be grappling with for many years to come."

She told officers her two-week-old son drowned in the bath in March 1980, USA Today reports. She also admitted suffocating a six-month-old boy she was babysitting in 1984 and a two-month-old girl who was also in her care a year later, according to a criminal complaint filed in Milwaukee The children's deaths were not investigated for decades, with police believing the infants had all suffered from from sudden infant death syndrome. But in 2015, Moronez's daughter told officers her mother had confessed to suffocating her son more than 30 years before - prompting authorities to discover the connection between the deaths and open an investigation. Prosecutors say Moronez told a detective she had killed her own child and two others, saying that she ""can't take kids that constantly cry"". While her daughter said Moronez killed her son with a rubbish bag, the accused said she had given the crying child a bath and held him in the water until he was dead, local media reported. She faces three counts of murder and is now in custody, according to records at the Milwaukee County Sheriff's office."

The 28-year-old snowboarder, from Southampton, joins Lizzy Yarnold, who won gold in the skeleton, Laura Deas and Dom Parsons, who both won bronze in the skeleton and Izzy Atkin who won bronze in the ski slopestyle. There were scenes of jubilation as Morgan realised he had secured a medal in big air, which involves pulling off the most impressive airborne trick possible after jumping off a giant ramp. He had only just squeezed into the final 12 in the event and scored 168 with his two jumps but was aided by the failure of some of his rivals to successfully land twice. Morgan's third place was behind gold medallist Sebastien Toutant of Canada and Kyle Mack of the United States, who claimed silver. He was only 6.25 points behind Toutant and 0.75 behind Mack. The event was watched by Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka, who cheered on her second-placed compatriot. The big air event was making its Olympic debut in South Korea, with Austrian Anna Gasser winning the women's gold medal on Thursday. Team GB, who are currently 18th in the medal table, had set themselves the target of achieving five medals. There is still a chance of at least one more medal if the women curlers are able to take bronze in the playoff for third after the team lost to Sweden in the semi final on Friday. Morgan didn't take up snowboarding until he was 17 and only embarked on his first full winter on snow at 17. In January 2012, a video of his performing a snowboarding trick attracted more than one million YouTube views. He is a social media star for his stunts, which include being the first to perform four flips and five full rotations. But he is no stranger to conventional media either, having posed wearing just his snowboard boots and his board for a national newspaper feature ahead of the Games."

""It's not a problem,"" he said. ""The Church of England has clear rules with dealing with that and we've dealt with that. ""We went through that as anyone would who will officiate at a wedding where someone has been separated and a partner is still living."" The Church of England agreed in 2002 that divorced people could remarry in church, with the discretion of the priest. Ms Markle married American film producer Trevor Engelson in 2011. They filed for divorce in 2013, citing ""irreconcilable differences"". It was announced in February that the Archbishop, who has written a new book called Reimagining Britain - Foundations for Hope, would officiate as the couple take their marriage vows on ‪19 May. It was also confirmed that the service will begin at midday at St George's Chapel with the Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd David Conner, conducting the service. Prince Harry and Ms Markle announced their engagement in November. A day later Kensington Palace confirmed that Meghan, who identifies as Protestant, would be baptised and confirmed ahead of her wedding day. As the first mixed-race person to marry into the Royal Family, there has been lots of excitement about the potential impact Meghan could have on wider issues surrounding diversity and inclusion. When asked what difference he thought she could make, the Archbishop said: ""The wedding is going to be wonderful. I'm looking forward to it enormously. ""I think one of the places I started when I was writing (the book) was the excitement of living in a much more diverse country than the one I grew up in 45, 50 years ago, and what a gift that can be rather than a threat. ""It gives uncertainties and challenges and worries and insecurities, but on the other side it gives just massive stimulation and interest and opportunity, and it's an incredibly positive place to live."" Asked whether issues around representation still need to be addressed, he said: ""There are challenges to be overcome but that's what makes life interesting."""
2018-02-24,The father of brain-damaged baby Isaiah Haastrup has had a visiting ban lifted after judges decided to allow the child's life support to be withdrawn.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180224143141/https://news.sky.com/story/isaiah-haastrup-dad-has-visiting-ban-lifted-as-judges-allow-life-support-to-be-withdrawn-11263158,"Last month, the High Court gave doctors permission to stop treatment for the one-year-old, against his parents' wishes. Specialists at King's College Hospital in London said giving further intensive care was ""futile, burdensome and not in his best interests"", and suggested only palliative care. The Court of Appeal has now upheld that decision and denied his parents permission to appeal. Lord Justice Patten, Lord Justice McFarlane and Lady Justice King, said there was no basis for overturning Mr Justice MacDonald's original decision to take Isaiah off life support. Isaiah's father, Lanre Haastrup, of Peckham, south-east London, had been banned from visiting his son at London's King's College Hospital after staff complained about his behaviour and on Thursday he lost an appeal to have that overturned. However, on Friday hospital bosses lifted the ban after Mr Haastrup raised concerns about never seeing Isaiah again. Speaking after the decision to ban him, he said the hospital ""should be ashamed of themselves - the way they've treated us"". ""How can you ban me from seeing my son despite having a judgment in there to kill him - for him to die. ""It's really sad - it's a sad day - where are we going in this country that a father has been banned with no criminal act?"" Mr Haastrup told reporters he believed the judges had ""got it wrong"" by not hearing evidence over treatment for his son, who he says is still responsive. ""We haven't heard what experts have to say about this treatment,"" he added. ""What their lordships should have done is at least hear from the experts who will come and examine Isaiah and then make a decision from that. ""All they've done is read some peer-reviewed articles and then said 'no, it's not going to work'. It's really sad."" Isaiah's father said the hospital had not told them when Isaiah's life support would be switched off, but that the family was planning an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France. ""They should wait and see what we do next - they shouldn't rush to kill him - to end his life,"" said Mr Haastrup. Isaiah suffered serious brain damage due to being deprived of oxygen at birth. Lawyers for King's College Hospital have said he is in a low level of consciousness and cannot move or breathe independently. Doctors also say Isaiah does not respond to stimulation - a claim his parents reject. His mother, Takesha Thomas, previously told judges: ""When I speak to him he will respond, slowly, by opening one eye. ""I see a child who is injured. He needs love. He needs care. I have it. I can give it. To say it is so poor, it is not worth living, that is not right. It is not their decision to make."""
2018-02-24,"James Brokenshire, the former Northern Ireland secretary who left the Cabinet after being diagnosed with lung cancer, has called for an end to the stigma surrounding the disease.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180224143141/https://news.sky.com/story/james-brokenshire-calls-for-end-to-lung-cancer-stigma-as-he-confirms-he-has-disease-11264491,"In his first broadcast interview since surgery to remove a tumour, he confirmed for the first time that he had cancer, and told Sky News he feels lucky to have been diagnosed early. Mr Brokenshire, who has never smoked, returned to Westminster this week just five weeks after having the upper lobe of his right lung removed at Guy's Hospital in London. His rehabilitation is ahead of schedule and his prognosis is good, with doctors confident that the cancer was contained. But he conceded the diagnosis had taken him to ""dark places"", and said support from his family, and from across the political spectrum, had been invaluable. ""It has been a hard few weeks. I've had surgery to remove the upper lobe of my right lung, and was fortunate for have an amazing surgeon and incredible support from the NHS team at Guy's,"" he said. ""It was quite a shock. You don't think that sort of thing would happen to you and it's quite something to go through. :: James Brokenshire MP: The moment I learned I had a lesion on my lung ""Reflecting now, I feel that I'm lucky that it was at a very early stage, it was in a place where surgery was available, but yes, it potentially takes you into some dark places. ""And it's not just about you, it's about family, Cathy [his wife] and the children and the impact it has on them. They've been an incredible strength to me. ""The love and support that they've given to me, I'm quite sure that I couldn't have got through it in the way I have and maintained the positive outlook I have, had it not been for them."" Mr Brokenshire first became concerned before Christmas when he cleared his throat and noticed a small amount of blood in his tissue. It was his only symptom but it prompted him to visit his GP, who referred him for a series of tests. The diagnosis process took place while Mr Brokenshire was at the heart of intense discussions over both power-sharing in Northern Ireland and Brexit. The definitive test came the morning after he was part of the team in Downing Street finalising the phase one agreement with the European Union. :: James Brokenshire: Former Northern Ireland Secretary recovering from lung surgery ""The easiest thing in the world for me to have done would have been to say, 'sorry I'm too busy, we'll put this off'. If I had, who knows what the prognosis or the outcome would have been. ""But I put my health first and I suppose that's a lesson for all of us. Your health is your priority. Without that where would any of us be?"" Before he underwent the surgery, Mr Brokenshire told Sky News about the ""jolt"" he experienced after being diagnosed. He hopes his case can be an example to others. ""I think we need to promote that lung cancer is about early diagnosis, about awareness, about ensuring there are the right pathways to get the clinical interventions that are needed. ""And also to break some of the stigma around lung cancer, because around 15% of cases are in non-smokers, people who have not smoked at all and yet there is this assumption that it must be your fault in some way. And we do need to break that."" Mr Brokenshire will focus on his constituency work from the back benches while his rehabilitation continues, and has no regrets about stepping away from Cabinet amid momentous political events. ""You have to be well. Look at the situation in Northern Ireland now, where sadly we still do not have agreement. You owe it to everyone to be able to give it 100%, and I could not do that so I have no regrets."" Health permitting, he is determined to return to the political front line in due course, however, and, as a long-term ally of the Prime Minister's, many in Westminster consider he has every chance."
2018-02-24,The United Nations has accused the UK of violating women's human rights by restricting access to abortions in Northern Ireland.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180224143141/https://news.sky.com/story/un-accuses-uk-of-violating-human-rights-over-ni-abortion-laws-11263896,"While abortions are provided for free in the rest of the UK, they are only allowed in Northern Ireland if a woman's life is at risk or there is a serious risk to her mental health. Women who have been raped, are pregnant due to incest or whose baby has a fatal foetal abnormalities cannot have a legal abortion. Many Northern Irish women travel to England, Scotland and Wales to have legal abortions on the NHS. The UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women said the law causes ""great harm and suffering"" to ""women and girls who carry pregnancies to full term against their will"". In a report published by the 23-expert committee, it said: ""The committee assesses the gravity of the violations in Northern Ireland in light of the suffering experienced by women and girls who carry pregnancies to full term against their will due to the current restrictive legal regime on abortion. ""It notes the great harm and suffering resulting from the physical and mental anguish of carrying an unwanted pregnancy to full term, especially in cases of rape, incest and severe foetal impairment. ""The situation gives Northern Ireland women three deplorable options: (a) undergo a torturous experience of being compelled to carry a pregnancy to full term; (b) engage in illegal abortion and risk imprisonment and stigmatisation; or, (c) undertake a highly stressful journey outside Northern Ireland to access a legal abortion. ""Women are thus torn between complying with discriminatory laws that unduly restrict abortion or risk prosecution and imprisonment."" The report makes 13 recommendations, including repealing the criminalisation of abortions in the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act. It said terminations should be allowed in Northern Ireland in cases of fatal foetal abnormality, sexual crime and when there is a threat to a woman's health that is not permanent. UN Human Rights Commission chief commissioner Les Allamby said the situation in the devolved country was wrong and violated women's human rights. Mr Allamby said: ""Today's report is timely as the commission is waiting for the outcome of our own legal challenge."" The report comes as the UK's Supreme Court is considering whether abortion laws in Northern Ireland are incompatible with international human rights. Grainne Teggart, Amnesty International's campaigns manager in Northern Ireland, said: ""This damning report from the United Nations confirms what Amnesty has long said, Northern Ireland's draconian abortion laws are a daily violation of the rights of women and girls. ""The UN committee is very clear that it is the UK Government which is responsible for ensuring that our laws are in line with the state's international human rights obligations. ""Devolution, even if functioning, does not relieve the UK Government of their responsibility to uphold human rights in Northern Ireland."" Nola Leach, chief executive of Christian Action Research and Education said the current laws provide ""support for the unborn child"" and that protection should not be undermined or removed. In 2015, Belfast's Court of Appeal ruled it was not up to courts to decide on the country's abortion law, but up to the Northern Ireland Assembly. A year later, the Assembly voted against legalising abortion in cases of fatal foetal abnormality by 59 votes to 40 and in cases of sexual crime by 64 votes to 30. Last June, Westminster announced women from Northern Ireland were entitled to free NHS abortions in England."

2018-02-24,"Henry Bolton became leader 142 days ago. And for 142 days in the sun, he has lost, more or less everything.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180224143141/https://news.sky.com/story/whither-ousted-ukip-leader-henry-bolton-11255778,"He has lost his wife, his family, his day job and today he lost the leadership of the party which had thrust him into the spotlight. When he became leader, 142 days ago, I was in the hall in Torquay. I remember that he was elected on a promise to professionalise the party. When I asked him, a few days ago, how that was going, he could only wince. Instead of professionalisation, his leadership has seen the party sink to new lows of infighting and humiliation. After the revelations of his mistress Jo Marney's racism, he received a unanimous vote of no confidence in his leadership from the party's National Executive Committee. Since then he has experienced the undoing of his private life and intense media scrutiny, which he compared to me as akin to that endured by Princess Diana. He hoped he could survive. Going into the make or break meeting, I was told that he had good reason to be hopeful. Nigel Farage had backed him; he had coachloads of supporters being brought in and he had apparently re-geared the race into a referendum on the unpopular NEC. Yet in the end, it wasn't even close. What happened? The media were banned from the meeting itself but sources who were inside tell me that to some extent, Mr Bolton lost it on the day. He made a bellicose speech which barely mentioned the allegations against him. He appeared ""arrogant"" and ""without contrition"". He launched a blistering attack on the NEC which he slammed as: ""The enemy within. The only loyalty these people have is to themselves. Their actions are despicable."" Mr Bolton's opponents were equally unforgiving. Sources tell me that Steve Crowther, former acting leader, speaking on behalf of the NEC, was scathing, ""going hard on Bolton lying to his family and wife"". Mr Crowther said: ""It is not that he has done wrong but that he refuses to accept that he has done wrong. ""It is not about the morality of what he has done but his political judgement. He has developed a reputation for being unreachable and always late. He is also a liar."" He then accused Mr Bolton of telling untruths about his CV. Up to then the forces seemed evenly balanced, with both sides being booed and heckled. The game-changer came when Paul Oakley, general-secretary of the party, addressed the crowd and revealed that Mr Bolton had only days before threatened to try and stop the Emergency General Meeting with legal action. In his right of reply, Mr Bolton did not deny this but indeed threatened it again. This did not go down well with the undecided voters. Threatening to sue your own party is not a good look. At that moment a source texted me: ""He's a goner."" The meeting was bitter and nasty but the rebels succeeded and Mr Bolton is gone. But for how much longer? On Thursday, Mr Bolton confirmed to me that he ""had three options"" if he lost. Today he confirmed to me that he was considering running for leader again. He said: ""You can't keep a good man down. You certainly haven't heard the last of me in politics."" He might well run again, there is nothing to prohibit him from doing so under the party's rules. He received 37% of the no-confidence vote. Under the UKIP's First Past the Post electoral system, he need not get a majority of the votes in a leadership contest, just one more than the second placed candidate. Talking to those in the hall, he clearly has supporters who would rally to his cause again. Senior UKIP figures are disparaging of the prospect. Welsh leader Neil Hamilton told me ""that he might well run, as he's shown he's no stranger to humiliation"". Gerard Batten, the interim leader, said that if he is thinking about it Mr Bolton should ""get a life"". But as a senior UKIP source told me: ""He might well do it, because he's lost everything else."" He is chasing the dying of the light. Whatever happens to Mr Bolton, his is a sorry tale but UKIP's story could be sorrier still. It is now on its seventh leader in 18 months. It faces the prospect of another leadership election which it cannot afford. It heads into a set of local elections where it is defending hundreds of seats, with no permanent leader. There are even rumours that its great hero Mr Farage - his spell over the apparently party broken - might set up a new party with former donor Aaron Banks. One woman will be relieved: Theresa May. The hardest proponents of the hardest Brexit are off the battlefield. That gives her breathing space on her Eurosceptic flank. In the end, UKIP have simply lost their reason to be. Like Del Boy after he finally became a millionaire, now their lifetime ambition of Brexit has been achieved, they just do not quite know quite what to do with themselves. The sticking plaster, which bound this disparate band of libertarians, social conservatives, economic protectionists, working class socialists and shire Tories together, has been ripped off. There's not much left. UKIP have been written off before. But in Birmingham, the stench of death is everywhere. As one source texted me as we all headed for home: ""Dead within a year, I reckon."""

Both boys died after being taken to hospital. A damaged black Ford Focus was found a short time after the crash. Robert Brown, 53, and Gwendoline Harrison, 41, have been charged under joint enterprise of two counts of causing death by dangerous driving, West Midlands Police said. Brown, of Attwood Crescent, Wyken, is also charged with driving while disqualified, no insurance and otherwise than in accordance with a licence, while Harrison, of Triumph Close, Wyken, faces a common assault allegation. They appeared at Coventry Magistrates' Court, sitting at Leamington Justice Centre. Corey and Casper's mother Louise Platt-May paid tribute to the boys following their deaths. She described Corey as ""an amazing boy"" who ""never kept still"", while his younger brother Casper was a ""cheeky little boy"" whose ""smile could light up any room"". The boys' aunt Chelsea Platt-May told Sky News they had been on the way to a family day out at the park at the time of the collision. ""I hope - it sounds horrible to say - they didn't suffer and I hope they were going with happy thoughts and not thoughts of pain,"" she said. Both boys were taken to hospital with severe injuries. Casper could not be revived and died a short time later. Corey died despite undergoing surgery. Family and friends have launched a number of fundraising pages to help their parents. Detective Sergeant Paul Hughes said: ""It is always tragic to lose loved ones, especially when so young, and we are continuing to offer our support to family members at such a devastating time. ""We are very appreciative of the overwhelming help we have received from the public during our investigations to date and we continue to ask anyone with information who has not already spoken to us to get in touch with us."""
2018-02-24,Two women have started a non-profit making group to provide toiletries for women who are unable to afford their own.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180224143141/https://news.sky.com/story/beauty-banks-the-toiletry-equivalent-to-food-banks-takes-off-11264629,"Jo Jones, a PR and beauty director, and her friend, beauty columnist and writer Sali Hughes, were, they say, partly motivated to act after hearing how teenage girls were ""rolling their own"" tampons because they couldn't afford sanitary products. The pair, who both work in the beauty industry, were appalled by what is sometimes known as period poverty. So, less than two weeks ago, they started Beauty Banks - the toiletry and beauty product equivalent to food banks. Ms Jones said: ""I just believe that everyone should be able to have a clean body, clean hair, go to school with deodorant on. ""For me, it's a dignity thing. It's about self-pride, self-care and self-confidence. Of course, you can't eat a deodorant, but these products are a dignity issue. ""We're just collecting products and sending them to the people who can distribute them to those in need. ""We were so aware of the amount of waste there is, particularly in the beauty industry, this is about us galvanising our contacts, as well as appealing to individuals [for donations]. ""We're just volunteers, we're a non-profit organisation, we're not a charity, we don't have any long term goals apart from getting the items out to people."" The scheme aims to provide essentials like soap, shampoo, tampons, sanitary towels, deodorant, toothbrushes and toothpaste and also items such as lipstick or moisturiser which can have a positive impact on someone's self-confidence. In a short space of time, support for the idea has snowballed. Ms Jones showed Sky News the area of her office at the Communications Store where her boss has allowed parcels to be sent; there's a mini-mountain of packages. Some are from beauty brands; most are from members of the public and contain notes praising what the girls and their friends are doing. She added: ""Most women have, well, we call it the graveyard cupboard, you just chuck all your beauty products in there and forget about them. ""We can only take unused products for safety issues, but we all scoop up things like free toothbrushes on airline travel, they're actually really good for homeless people because they're moving around a lot."" Ms Hughes said it's about helping people to feel human. ""There's a huge link between self-care, good grooming and mental health,"" she said. ""Feeling like you don't smell the same as everyone else, standing out in that way, is not good for your mental health. ""Food banks are reporting that over half of their users are foregoing essential toiletries to eat. That's ridiculous. ""It's nothing for us to buy some extra tampons or sanitary towels but, actually, in real terms, that can mean a girl going to school knowing she's adequately protected."" Ms Hughes said the response they've received has been overwhelming. ""We thought we may get a couple of dozen packages, what we didn't expect is pallets and pallets of stuff arriving every day and that's a brilliant problem to have,"" she added. ""We're thrilled. The food banks are so pleased. ""We're already in Milton Keynes, Cardiff and Liverpool and we're hoping to edge further out."" St Paul's Church in Stratford runs one of the food banks that has already benefited from the boxes. Reverend Jeremy Fraser said having the extra products has been a ""godsend"". ""It is sadly really needed,"" he said. ""A lot of people are living quite tight lives on their money, so when things start to go wrong they go wrong really quickly. ""These items are a luxury in one sense, but actually if you are going to be human you need some things around you that mean you are going to be clean, that your clothes are clean. ""If I'm going to feel human in the morning having toothpaste and a toothbrush makes all the difference. ""If I was a woman then I'd want tampons. It's basic things that make us value people and honour them and not them treat them like they're less than us - because they're not... actually any one of us could be there one day."""
2018-02-24,Rapper Stormzy has continued his battle with the Prime Minister over the Grenfell Tower fire by urging support for a bid to overhaul an inquiry into the tragedy.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180224143141/https://news.sky.com/story/rapper-stormzy-continues-battle-with-theresa-may-over-grenfell-tower-fire-11264438,"The grime and hip hop star called on his more than one million Twitter followers to sign a petition demanding Theresa May use her powers to appoint additional panel members to the independent public inquiry. Within a few hours of his tweet, the petition had registered more than 100,000 signatures - the number required for the petition to be considered for debate by MPs. It was started by Adel Chaoui, who lost four relatives in the blaze and wants a more diverse make-up to the inquiry. Alongside a link to the online petition, Stormzy (real name Michael Omari) wrote on Twitter: ""This needs 100,000 signatures if you could please sign, share, RT and spread the word on it."" He later urged people to ""pleaseeeee don't be paigon"", using a slang term for someone who does nothing and a word he has previously used to describe Mrs May. This needs 100,000 signatures if you could please sign, share, RT and spread the word on it. https://t.co/zpSE3qy2bq ðŸ™?ðŸ?¿â?¤ï¸? The petition, which was previously delivered to Downing Street, calls for the Prime Minister to appoint additional panel members with decision-making power to sit alongside retired judge Sir Martin Moore-Bick, who is the chair of the Grenfell Tower inquiry. It states such a move is ""fundamental"" to ""avoid a collapse of confidence in the inquiry's ability to discover the truth"" of the tragedy. The panel members ""must be appointed with relevant background, expertise, experience and a real understanding of the issues facing those affected"", it adds. The petition also calls for legal representatives of victims' families to ""see all evidence from the start"" of the inquiry and be ""allowed to question witnesses at the hearings"". Earlier this week, Stormzy used his appearance at the BRIT Awards to question the Mrs May's response to the Grenfell Tower disaster, which took the lives of 71 people. In a politically-charged performance, Stormzy rapped: ""Yo Theresa May, where's the money for Grenfell? ""What, you thought we just forgot about Grenfell? You criminals, and you've got the cheek to call us savages, you should do some jail time, you should pay some damages, you should burn your house down and see if you can manage this."" In response, Downing Street insisted the Prime Minister is ""absolutely committed"" to supporting those affected by the devastating tower block blaze in north Kensington, west London, last June. The appointment of Sir Martin to chair the public inquiry into the disaster proved controversial after local residents questioned his ability to relate to survivors. He has appointed seven expert witnesses and three assessors to help with his work. Late last year, Mrs May was criticised after she rejected the request from Grenfell survivors - after the petition now being promoted by Stormzy was delivered to Downing Street - to appoint additional panel members. Under the Inquiries Act 2005, only the Prime Minister has the power to change an inquiry's format. In a formal response to the petition, triggered by its reaching 10,000 signatures, the Government said: ""Having regard to the terms of reference and the assistance to be provided by the assessors, and the expert witnesses, it is the Prime Minister's view that the inquiry panel has the necessary expertise to undertake the Inquiry as it is currently constituted."" Grenfell families criticised the timing of Mrs May's announcement of her decision on the last working day before Christmas."

Severe weather warnings have been issued for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, with 20cm of snow predicted in places. Temperatures are expected to drop close to -15C (5F) in some areas and forecasters say the icy conditions could last until the middle of March. A yellow ""be aware"" warning is in place for Monday in eastern England, the Midlands, Yorkshire, the North East and London, with five to 10cm of snow expected. A more severe amber alert - meaning there is a ""potential risk to life and property"" - has been issued on Tuesday for eastern England, the South East and London, Yorkshire, the Midlands and the North East, when up to 15cm of snow is predicted.

There are further yellow warnings for snow across southern England, London, Wales and the West Midlands on Thursday. The mercury is expected to fall to -8C (46.4F) in many places at night this week, and close to -15C (5F) in some areas. Daytime temperatures will remain in low single figures but may feel as cold as -11C (12.2F) with the wind chill, forecasters say. The Met Office has also issued an amber cold weather alert for England - its second highest level - which warns of increased health risks to vulnerable and elderly people. The AA urged drivers to take extra care and said it was mobilising extra resources for an increase in demand for help over the coming week. The prolonged spell of cold weather has been blamed on a rare North Pole phenomenon called ""sudden stratospheric warming"". The event disrupted the polar vortex in the upper atmosphere, resulting in bitterly cold air sweeping in from Siberia, according to forecasters. Sky News weather presenter Nazaneen Ghaffar said: ""Easterly winds this coming week, otherwise known as 'the Beast from the East', will spread in bitterly cold air originating from western Russia, where temperatures there are currently as low as -23C (-9.4F). ""We're not expecting temperatures to fall that low for the UK and Ireland, but they will drop close to freezing during the day, and well below that overnight. ""The winds will also strengthen, so there will be a significant wind chill, making it feel much colder than the temperatures suggest. ""The brisk easterly winds will also spread through snow showers off the North Sea, which will initially affect eastern parts of the UK on Monday morning, but through the week the strong winds will spread them further west, so all areas will be at risk of seeing snow over the coming days. ""A more persistent area of snow also looks likely to move south-westwards across the UK on Tuesday giving significant accumulations, and towards the end of the working week central and southern areas may also be affected with another dumping of snow. ""So in summary, disruptive snow falls are likely just about anywhere this week, especially across southern and eastern areas."""

Having been appointed to the role during the party leadership of Ed Miliband, Mr McNicol went on to experience a turbulent time under current party leader Jeremy Corbyn. During an attempt by Labour MPs to remove Mr Corbyn as leader in 2016, Mr McNicol was reportedly accused of trying to stop the left-winger from being able to stand for re-election. The row subsequently led to reports Mr Corbyn's allies were plotting to dislodge Mr McNicol as the party's chief, amid Labour's turmoil in the wake of the EU referendum result. Mr McNicol's departure prompted suggestions Mr Corbyn's supporters have now further tightened their grip on Labour's internal machinery. Last month, three candidates backed by Corbyn backing group Momentum were elected to Labour's ruling National Executive Committee (NEC). It has raised expectations an ally of Mr Corbyn will now be appointed as Mr McNicol's successor. Swansea West MP Geraint Davies, who backed Mr Corbyn's rival Owen Smith during the 2016 Labour leadership contest, urged the party to choose a successor to Mr McNicol who ""works for unity across the broad church of the party to deliver victory & success for all our communities"". Fellow so-called Labour ""moderate"", Streatham MP Chuka Umunna, said Mr McNicol had ""done a smashing job for our party and our politics, and has had to put up with a lot of flak for doing so"". He added: ""We owe him a huge debt of gratitude."" Announcing his resignation late on Friday, Mr McNicol described being Labour's general secretary as ""an absolute honour and a privilege"". He said in a statement: ""I have now decided to move on to pursue new challenges in the service of the Labour Party and wider labour movement. ""I would like to thank our fantastic staff across the country for their brilliant work and support. A team who continuously go above and beyond to deliver for Labour."" Mr McNicol added: ""I will continue to support Jeremy Corbyn's leadership and will work closely with him and our whole parliamentary team to take Labour to victory at the next general election."" Mr Corbyn thanked Mr McNicol for his ""long and dedicated service"", adding: ""He has run our party's organisation at a time of great change, including a near tripling of the membership, two general elections and the EU referendum. ""Iain has served the Labour Party and trade union movement in a wide range of roles throughout his career and is a credit to our movement. ""I am confident Iain will continue to play a major role in politics and our party, and will support our team inside and outside Parliament with his experience and skills."" Labour officials will meet to decide the process for the election of Mr McNicol's successor. A party spokesperson said: ""To maintain stability, Iain will work with our NEC Officers to deliver a smooth and proper transition ensuring that the Labour Party remains on an election footing."""

The victim, who has not been named, said: ""I was a prisoner of war in 1943 and believed I was going to be shot, but I was not as afraid then as I now feel in my own home."" The intruders broke into his home in the Yardley area of Birmingham at 2am on 17 February as the man watched television. They also disconnected the phone line during the raid on his house. One of the two burglars pinned down the man as the other searched the house and stole jewellery, watches and cash. The pair are believed to have climbed over a wall in the back garden and broke in through a window. DC Laura Halpin, who is leading the investigation, said: ""This would be an absolutely terrifying ordeal for anyone to endure, let alone a defenceless 96-year-old man inside his own home.

2018-02-24,Tony Blair has urged Labour to team up with Tory rebels and force the Government to stay in a customs union with the EU.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180224143141/https://news.sky.com/story/tony-blair-calls-on-labour-to-join-tory-brexit-rebels-over-customs-union-bid-11264063,"The former prime minister used his latest intervention over Brexit to warn of ""economic dislocation"", express fears of a return to violence in Northern Ireland, and repeat his call for a second EU referendum. Speaking to Sky News, Mr Blair claimed there are ""at least four different types of Brexit now being debated in Parliament"" as he rubbished Theresa May's oft-used phrase ""Brexit means Brexit"". This week, Tory Remainer rebels - led by ex-minister Anna Soubry - have raised the prospect of a Government defeat over the Prime Minister's plan not to join any form of customs union with the EU after Brexit. In a tabled amendment to the Trade Bill, Ms Soubry is hoping to alter the legislation in order to compel the Government to retain a customs union with the EU after leaving the bloc. She has cited cross-party support for her move, with Mr Blair calling on the Labour Party as a whole to join with Ms Soubry's group of Tory rebels. ""It shouldn't be a matter of Labour or Conservative, it should be a matter of what people really think is in the interests of the country,"" he said. ""If there is an amendment that is going to unite some people in the Conservative Party with the Labour Party, yes we should be all for it."" The Labour Party itself is expected to formally back remaining in a customs union with the EU, with Jeremy Corbyn due to deliver a major Brexit speech on Monday after coming under pressure to clarify his party's position. Mr Blair welcomed the ""good evolution of policy"" but admitted he wants Labour to ""go further"". He also stated how Labour would be accepting the UK would not be signing new trade deals with non-EU countries after Brexit. ""If you're in a comprehensive customs union, between the UK and the EU, you're not really going to be striking free trade deals with other countries,"" he said. ""And, in so far as you are in any form of customs union, you are going make yourself much less attractive to those other countries to strike a trade deal."" The ex-premier cited fears of political instability on the island of Ireland due to Mrs May's decision to rule out any form of customs union with the EU, which he claimed would see the establishment of a ""hard border"" between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. ""This, I think everyone accepts, the Government accepts, would be a disaster for relations between the two countries and for the Good Friday Agreement,"" Mr Blair said. ""So what's the answer? If you're not in some form of customs union with the EU, you're going to be with a hard border and you're going to disrupt significantly the trade between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland."" Mr Blair recalled how he would ""wake up every morning to the news from Northern Ireland of terrorist acts, of deaths, of destruction"" prior to the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. ""You can't put that at risk,"" he said. ""A major part of the agreement was precisely on the basis that the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland would have an open border. ""So that there would be an acceptance that even though Northern Ireland was staying inside the UK, nonetheless there was a recognition of the politics of the island of Ireland. ""If you break that up you're doing something really irresponsible."" On Thursday, the Prime Minister hauled senior members of her Cabinet to her Chequers country retreat to thrash out an agreed position for the next stage of Brexit negotiations. Mr Blair claimed divisions within both Cabinet and Parliament on the possible future UK-EU relationship showed how ""there are different versions of Brexit"", as he repeated his demand for a second vote on Britain's EU membership. He suggested it is ""increasingly"" possible there won't be a majority in Parliament ""for any particular type of Brexit"" due to the ""impasse"" among MPs. ""At that point, the sensible thing - since this whole Brexit business originated from the referendum in June 2016 - is to say it's got to go back to the people to decide,"" he added. ""Do they want what is on offer from the Government now as opposed to what we have now in the EU?"" Mr Blair spoke to Sky News as he released a new article titled ""Brexit: The Realities of 'Taking Back Control'"". He said his paper shows how there is a global ""consensus"" that a ""clean break Brexit"" will result in ""significant economic damage"" to the UK."

""I am commenting on the outcome of the Chequers meeting when I know what the exact conclusions are,"" European Commission President Jean-Claude Junker said.

That's not possible and I think the United Kingdom really needs to square that circle and it doesn't appear to me that that circle has yet been squared."" But in language which will be seen as encouraging by the British Government, the President of the European Parliament, Antonio Tajani repeated a phrase often used by Theresa May. ""The UK will be outside the European Union but not outside Europe,"" Mr Tajani said. ""We are working all together for a good Brexit. For us its important to achieve good solutions.""

Last night, as the British Cabinet were wrapping up their crunch Brexit talks at Chequers, the leaders of 13 EU countries were sitting down for dinner at a chateau on the edge of Brussels.

The presidents of the European Commission and European Council, Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk, were not among the guests. After the dinner, Mr Varadkar, tweeted: ""Met up with Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel and other EU colleagues in Brussels last night to talk Brexit and the future of Europe. [The] EU has stood firmly beside Ireland throughout Brexit negotiations."" The crux of their discussion was a private conversation about potential candidates for senior EU leadership positions which are up for grabs next year, but Brexit was discussed too. The degree to which the remaining members of the European Union maintain united in their approach to Brexit is key to the outcome of the negotiations. Some countries, like the Netherlands and Belgium, with closer trade ties to the UK, are concerned about the impact of a hard Brexit on their local economy and may push for a softer Brexit. While the British Government has yet to explicitly outline the type of Brexit it wants to secure, Mrs May has repeatedly said that she wants a bespoke deal rather than opting for an ""off-the-shelf"" model like a Canada-style trade deal or a Norway-type relationship. Under the so-called ""three baskets"" model, discussed at Chequers, the UK would, post-Brexit, place EU regulations into three baskets. In basket one, EU regulations would be followed as if the UK were still an EU member. In basket two, the objectives of EU regulations would be the same, but would be achieved in a different way. And in basket three, areas where the UK would diverge completely from the EU approach. Although seen as a possible neat compromise for divided factions of the UK Government, the EU Commission has already said ""the 'three baskets approach' [is] not compatible with the principles in the European Council guidelines"". The EU Commission believes that the model breaks the red-lines set by the member states of the EU. They worry that the autonomy of EU decision-making and the integrity of the single market will be weakened and also that other countries outside the EU will seek similar bespoke arrangements, undermining the whole European Union project."

Or had to choose between buying toothpaste or food? And when your toothbrush is worn or razor blunt, do you replace it with a new one, or have to make do for longer than is healthy? These are decisions most of us don't consciously make, but for some 13 million Britons living in poverty, they're a daily reality. Simple, everyday toiletries like shower gel, tampons, towels, razors, soap, shampoo, deodorant, represent the costly choice between keeping clean and eating. :: The toiletry equivalent to food banks takes off My colleague Jo Jones' and my decision to launch Beauty Banks, a non-profit collective of beauty professionals attempting to combat hygiene poverty, was the result of several shocking or upsetting moments. We both knew teachers who were routinely taking sanitary protection in for their most hard-up female pupils, so that those girls could come in to school and learn during a period. We'd both read a report by charity In Kind Direct that identified ""hygiene poverty"" as ""a hidden crisis"" in Britain, and one that's growing fast. A lack of basic toiletries is such a big concern for their recipient charities (such as food banks) that In Kind Direct distributed £2.2m worth of products to them last year – a rise of 67% on 2016. We each read reports of men and women rising at 5am to go to a homeless shelter for a shower and a clothes wash, before heading off to work for an eight-hour shift. In 2018 Britain, it just wasn’t, and isn’t, good enough. But our talks became more urgent this last winter, when some friends and I slept rough on London’s Greenwich Peninsula to raise money for homeless charity Centrepoint. Despite having been homeless myself as a teenager, I had never slept on the street before, and while nothing could ever truly replicate the horror of the real thing, neither could anything have prepared me for how dreadful I felt the next morning, at 6.30am, when we were told to get up and move on, without so much as a comb through the hair or a brush of the teeth. It was too cold to change our underwear, our clothes were muddy and there was nowhere to wash. Our breath and hair smelled and all of us went straight home to cry in a hot bath. I was acutely aware that many people don't have that option. To feel dirty, to be conscious of one's own odour, is to feel bad. People living in poverty - whether in their own homes, in temporary accommodation or on the streets - deserve the same basic dignity and self care that everyone else enjoys. No one should suffer the indignity of not being able to shave for a job interview, or of attending school without proper period protection, and nor should anyone have to skip washing to feed their kids. We shouldn’t accept it for others. We should help them. And so, in Beauty Banks, Jo and I are asking the beauty industry and the beauty community, as well as members of the public, to send us their unused toiletries so that we can sort and pack large care packs for food banks and homeless shelters across Britain. You can help by collecting together anything new and useful, from babies' toothbrushes to men's shaving gel, from soap to roll-on. When you've gathered together enough for a parcel and removed any restricted solvents (perfume and nail polish), pack it all into a box and kindly write ""Beauty Banks"" on every side of it, then post to: BEAUTY BANKSc/o JO JONESTHE COMMUNICATIONS STORE2 KENSINGTON SQUARELONDON W8 5EP If you'd like to avoid post office queues and fees, you can buy us anything from boots.com, superdrug.com and amazon.co.uk (our wish list is here) and get it sent direct to us. In any case, we will make sure they reach someone who desperately wants and needs them - someone who will feel fresher, cleaner, better, because of you."
2018-02-24,"Former BHS owner Dominic Chappell has been ordered to pay £87,170 for failing to provide pensions information to an investigation into the collapse of the retailer.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180224143141/https://news.sky.com/story/former-bhs-owner-dominic-chappell-fined-87000-in-pension-case-11263903,"A judge said the businessman, who bought BHS for £1 from tycoon Sir Philip Green a year before its collapse, showed a ""complete lack of remorse"". The 88-year-old company went into administration in 2016, resulting in 11,000 job losses and leaving a £571m black hole in its pension fund. Chappell told Barkingside Magistrates' Court in east London that the ""great perception of me having made millions from BHS"" was not true and that he had been ""financially crippled"". But District Judge Gary Lucie said: ""There's been a complete lack of remorse on Mr Chappell's part. ""Even when asked questions about his means he gave a self-serving and uninvited diatribe about the case. ""His counsel... said he was a 'victim in all this' - in my mind that cannot be further from the truth."" Chappell was given a fine of £50,000 and ordered to pay more than £37,000 in court costs. He was told to pay the fine in instalments of £2,500 a month. He was found guilty last month of failing to cooperate with The Pensions Regulator (TPR). The case centred on official requests for information before and after BHS's collapse. Chappell, 51, had claimed he could not provide information as he had been locked out of the chain's headquarters after it folded but this was dismissed as ""simply not believable"" by the trial judge. He was convicted of three charges after a four-day trial at Brighton Magistrates' Court in January. At his sentencing hearing, the businessman said he would have to take out a loan if he was fined. Chappell said he was behind on a number of bills and had ""huge amounts of cash flooding out the door"", adding: ""I can't afford to pay."" His outgoings included £3,800 a month rent on the Dorset home where he lives with his wife and children, around £32,000 a year renting a new Range Rover and £2,500 a month on private school fees. He said his only income was a salary of between £2,700 and £3,000 as a consultant for a small cosmetics company. Chappell's assets included a house near Blandford Forum, which he said was heavily mortgaged and had no equity, and shares in a Gibraltar-based property investment company that owns land in Portugal. He also said he had been served with a £10m contribution notice from TPR. Judge Lucie said Chappell had failed fully to disclose his financial situation, adding that he had ""extensive outgoings"" and must have more income than he claimed. Speaking outside court, the businessman said that the sentence was ""harsh"" and that he had launched an appeal. A spokesman for retail workers' union Usdaw said: ""The innocent hard-working and loyal BHS employees got their sentence when administrators closed the business, today the guilty Mr Chappell got his."" Nicola Parish, TPR director of regulation, said: ""We prosecuted Dominic Chappell because despite numerous requests he failed to provide us with information we required in connection with our investigation into the sale and ultimate collapse of BHS. ""Choosing not to comply has now left him with a criminal record and a bill for more than £87,000, both of which he could have avoided if he had simply done what was required of him."""

The Old Bailey previously heard claims he swore the children to secrecy, and he admitted to the court he showed them an IS video to give them a ""more holistic"" view of the terror group. A young Muslim boy, whose police interview was played to jurors, told detectives that Haque was ""teaching us terrorism, like how to fight"", the court heard. He claimed Haque aimed to get a ""group of 300 men"" and that the boys had acted out scenarios involving guns and a ""car bomb"". Haque is also accused of looking at other targets in the capital, including the Queen's Guards and Westfield shopping centre. His support for Islamic State-inspired atrocities, such as the Westminster Bridge attack, was revealed in secretly recorded conversations, prosecutors claim. London-born Haque denies preparing acts of terrorism between 25 March and 18 May last year. He also denies preparing terrorist acts by leading the children in exercises and role-play. Three east London men Haque allegedly recruited through the mosque are also on trial. Abuthaher Mamun, 19, denies preparing acts of terrorism. Muhammad Abid, 27, is accused of having information about Haque's plans, and Nadeem Patel, 26, of plotting with Haque to possess a firearm or imitation firearm. The men deny the charges."
2018-02-24,"Theresa May goes into the weekend celebrating a triumph. After eight hours of talks with her inner Brexit cabinet at Chequers, the Prime Minister emerged with a fragile peace deal and plan for Britain's future relationship with the EU.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180224143141/https://news.sky.com/story/theresa-mays-brexit-talks-deal-brings-fragile-peace-to-warring-tories-11264273,"No one stormed out in protest as the Prime Minister managed to stitch together a compromise deal hooked on ""managed divergence"". All sides emerged content, with lead Remainer Philip Hammond ""relaxed and pleased"" and Boris Johnson ""positive"" too. The details will be fleshed out Mrs May's keynote speech next week, but some sketchy details are emerging about the essence of that deal. :: EU boss calls UK's Brexit position 'an illusion' Sky News understands that the inner Brexit cabinet agreed three main principles on Thursday night. First, the UK will seek an agreement on ""mutual recognition on goods standards"" and then maintain those standards after Brexit - effectively ensuring UK rules and standards remain closely aligned to those of the EU to ensure continuing smooth trade. The Brexit cabinet also signed off on a proposal for ""equal dispute settlement arrangements"" to reassure MPs that European courts will not have power over the UK and, third, agreed the principle that Britain would have the ""right to diverge"" from EU rules. :: Will Brexit slaughter the prospects for Welsh lamb?  It all sounds very technical and dry, but at its heart this deal is an attempt by Mrs May to offer something to both sides of her fractured party. For the Brexiteers, the broad agreement on the need for divergence is an important staging post on their journey to secure a ""Canada plus-plus-plus"" style free trade deal unshackled from the customs union and single market. :: May facing fresh Commons Brexit rebellion And for fellow Remainers, there is clear reassurance that the starting point is close UK-EU alignment that you move away from when you ""feel it's the right thing to do"". But the tensions within her party are never far from the surface, with trouble brewing on both sides even as she brokered that deal at her country retreat in Buckinghamshire. Team Brexit is fuming over No 10's handling of a letter - signed by more than 60 MPs - from the powerful European Research Group setting out its demands for a clean break from the EU. MPs told me this week that four junior members of government - parliamentary aides to ministers - were hauled in by the whips and given a dressing down for signing the letter. ""Some have been threatened and bullied and told they will lose their jobs,"" said one senior source. ""There is no good grace at all."" :: Blair urges Labour revolt over customs union Meanwhile, on Team Remain former ministers Anna Soubry and Nicky Morgan are leading a rebellion to keep Britain in the customs union. Five senior backbenchers have already put their name to a cross-party amendment that could inflict a Government defeat, and believe that figure could rise to at least a dozen. The amendment, tabled on Friday, comes amid growing expectations that Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is preparing to shift Labour's position to support the UK remaining in the customs union in a keynote speech on Monday. Ms Soubry told Sky News last night that she hoped a change in the Labour frontbench position would not deter Tory rebels from supporting the amendment. ""I always said this was bigger than this [party politics] stuff; that is why I tabled this amendment today,"" she said. But, for now, Mrs May has navigated another turn on the perilous road to Brexit. The next hairpin bend arrives on Friday when she makes that all-important Brexit speech."
2018-02-24,"The directors of Toys R Us's British chain are preparing to appoint administrators early next week in a move that will threaten more than 3,000 jobs on an already-troubled high street.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180224143141/https://news.sky.com/story/3200-jobs-at-risk-as-toys-r-us-uk-lines-up-administrator-11264021,"Sky News has learnt that bosses from the ailing chain met officials from the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) on Friday to notify them of the impending move amid fading hopes of a rescue deal. Toys R Us UK has been engaged in a frantic search for a buyer for the last month following weak Christmas trading which has left it with little hope of paying a £15m VAT bill due on Tuesday. Sources said that the directors of the UK's biggest toy retailer were likely to appoint administrators on Tuesday morning barring the emergence of a last-minute financial package to keep it afloat. One insider said that such a prospect was ""very, very remote"" on Friday evening. Moorfields, a corporate recovery specialist which worked on the administration of the DVD rental chain Blockbuster five years ago, is said to have been put on standby to oversee Toys R Us's potential insolvency. With only three days before the VAT bill is understood to be payable, hopes of finding a rescue backer for the chain, which trades from more than 100 stores, have dwindled. Alteri Investors, an acquirer of distressed retailers, and Hilco Capital, which salvaged the music chain HMV in 2013, have both held talks with Toys R Us UK in the last fortnight but have baulked at the complexity of a deal. The prospect of Toys R Us collapsing comes almost exactly two months after the chain appeared to have salvaged its future by winning support from creditors - including the PPF - for a deal to slash its rent bill and close dozens of loss-making stores. That Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) plan was overseen by advisors at Alvarez & Marsal, prompting the PPF to demand that an independent firm be appointed to handle Toys R Us UK's administration. Toys R Us UK only survived the Christmas period after the PPF agreed at the eleventh hour to vote in favour of the CVA, which had been due to trigger the closure of a quarter of its 105 shops. The CVA was expected to involve the injection of £9.8m into the retailer's pension scheme, while shortening its deficit recovery period to 10 years. If it fails to avoid administration, the scheme will be taken on by the PPF, with any such move certain to attract scrutiny from Frank Field, the Labour chairman of the Commons Work and Pensions Select Committee. The entire European operations of Toys R Us are also on the market, encompassing 236 stores outside the UK in 10 countries including Austria, France, Germany and Spain. In the US, where Toys R Us filed for bankruptcy protection last year, plans emerged this week for the closure of a further 200 of its stores, according to the Wall Street Journal. Toys R Us UK is far from the only British retailer experiencing an existential crisis. Maplin, the electricals chain, is racing to find a buyer and avoid administration, while New Look and House of Fraser are among the retailers seeking financial support from landlords and other creditors. Toys R Us UK and the PPF declined to comment on Friday."

Severe weather warnings have been issued for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, with 20cm of snow predicted in places. Temperatures are expected to drop close to -15C (5F) in some areas and forecasters say the icy conditions could last until the middle of March. A yellow ""be aware"" warning is in place for Monday in eastern England, the Midlands, Yorkshire, the North East and London, with five to 10cm of snow expected. A more severe amber alert - meaning there is a ""potential risk to life and property"" - has been issued on Tuesday for eastern England, the South East and London, Yorkshire, the Midlands and the North East, when up to 15cm of snow is predicted. An amber weather warning for #snow has been updated: https://t.co/QwDLMfRBfs Stay #weatheraware @metofficeuk pic.twitter.com/9nyDU0GxiU An amber alert for snow is also in place for Scotland and northern England on Wednesday, with 10 to 20cm expected in places. ""Travel delays on roads are likely, stranding some vehicles and passengers,"" the Met Office said. ""Some delays and cancellations to rail and air travel are likely.

There are further yellow warnings for snow across southern England, London, Wales and the West Midlands on Thursday. The mercury is expected to fall to -8C (46.4F) in many places at night this week, and close to -15C (5F) in some areas. Daytime temperatures will remain in low single figures but may feel as cold as -11C (12.2F) with the wind chill, forecasters say. The Met Office has also issued an amber cold weather alert for England - its second highest level - which warns of increased health risks to vulnerable and elderly people. The AA urged drivers to take extra care and said it was mobilising extra resources for an increase in demand for help over the coming week. The prolonged spell of cold weather has been blamed on a rare North Pole phenomenon called ""sudden stratospheric warming"". The event disrupted the polar vortex in the upper atmosphere, resulting in bitterly cold air sweeping in from Siberia, according to forecasters. Sky News weather presenter Nazaneen Ghaffar said: ""Easterly winds this coming week, otherwise known as 'the Beast from the East', will spread in bitterly cold air originating from western Russia, where temperatures there are currently as low as -23C (-9.4F). ""We're not expecting temperatures to fall that low for the UK and Ireland, but they will drop close to freezing during the day, and well below that overnight. ""The winds will also strengthen, so there will be a significant wind chill, making it feel much colder than the temperatures suggest. ""The brisk easterly winds will also spread through snow showers off the North Sea, which will initially affect eastern parts of the UK on Monday morning, but through the week the strong winds will spread them further west, so all areas will be at risk of seeing snow over the coming days. ""A more persistent area of snow also looks likely to move south-westwards across the UK on Tuesday giving significant accumulations, and towards the end of the working week central and southern areas may also be affected with another dumping of snow. ""So in summary, disruptive snow falls are likely just about anywhere this week, especially across southern and eastern areas."""
2018-02-25,About 120 detainees in immigration detention centre Yarl's Wood have reportedly been on four days of hunger strike against continued incarceration of migrants in the UK.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180225151009/https://news.sky.com/story/120-women-on-hunger-strike-in-immigration-centre-11265270,"The detainees, who are all women, began striking on 21 February, in a protest at what they described as ""some of the most offensive"" government practices on immigration. They include the detention of survivors of rape, torture and human trafficking, poor heath care conditions, and the detention of people indefinitely and without the decision of a judge. In a note circulated by campaigners online, detainees say the ""Home Office is overwhelmed, not fit for purpose and operates in a rogue manner"". Some 410 people, most of whom are women, are currently detained at Yarl's Wood in Bedfordshire. This is a fraction of the 30,000 who enter the UK's immigration detention system each year, for reasons including overstaying a visa, awaiting deportation after a rejected claim, or while an asylum application is being processed. Uniquely in Europe, the UK does not put a time limit on how long detainees can be held - a situation one striker said creates ""unbearable"" uncertainty, combined with the constant fear of deportation. A spokesperson for Serco, the private contractor that runs the centre, told Sky News that there was no hunger strike. The Home Office denied people were detained indefinitely. ""When people are detained, it is for the minimum time possible and detention is reviewed on a regular basis,"" a spokesperson said in a statement. ""Any decision to maintain detention is made on a case by case basis but their welfare remains of the utmost importance throughout."" Sent from Yarl's Wood strikers: ""We believe that the Home Office is overwhelmed, not fit for purpose and operates in a rogue manner."" #HungerForFreedom pic.twitter.com/BsuFsp8jj3 A 2017 report on the centre did not find evidence of widespread abuse, stating there had been ""significant"" improvements following a 2015 report that said it was ""failing to meet the needs of the most vulnerable women"". But campaigners say that imprisoning people because of their migration status is inhumane and unnecessary - particularly as 70% of women held in Yarl's Wood are eventually released into the community. ""People are not locked up to punish them for committing a crime and this terrifying, humiliating experience can have a hugely damaging impact on their mental and physical health,"" Dr Lisa Doyle, Director of Advocacy at the Refugee Council previously said. ::Staff suspended from Brook House Immigration detention after abuse claims Meeting with former #YarlsWood detainees to hear about their harrowing experiences of detention pic.twitter.com/cZwKhrSBX7 On Friday detainees - including some hunger strikers - spoke to shadow home secretary Diane Abbot, who was at the centre for a planned visit. The MP tweeted she listened to ""harrowing experiences of detention"" from the women and said she was ""deeply concerned about how desperate the women were, their medical care and how long some have been detained"". Women involved in the strike have said they will continue to protest by refusing to work in the centre's kitchens or gardens - for which they are normally paid £1 a day. ""I am sick of feeling like a helpless institutionalised victim and refuse to participate in detention,"" one participant, who described herself as an ""angry foreigner who was made in Britain"", said."

It comes after she held a ""war Cabinet"" meeting at her country residence Chequers to work out forthcoming Brexit negotiations strategy. Mrs May said: ""On Thursday, I told the Cabinet committee at Chequers that the deal we negotiate with the EU must present an ambitious future for our great country. ""Next week I will present the committee's conclusions to an additional session of the full Cabinet before travelling to the North East on Friday to give a speech setting out this Government's vision of what our future economic partnership with the European Union should look like. ""Delivering the best Brexit is about our national future, part of the way we improve the lives of people all over the country. ""So I concluded the meeting by reminding the committee that the decisions we make now will shape this country for a generation. ""If we get them right, Brexit will be the beginning of a bright new chapter in our national story, and our best days really do lie ahead of us."" It comes as Minister for the Cabinet Office David Lidington, effectively Mrs May’s number two, said the SNP represents a danger to trade agreements. He told The Sunday Telegraph the Scottish nationalists' demands for a series of powers currently held by Brussels risked causing serious damage to the country’s ability to strike deals. Ministers fear that differences in Scottish, Welsh and English standards, in areas such as food safety and chemicals, could prevent them arranging agreements on behalf of the whole country. Mr Lidington said: ""We could choose to leave as a country split and an economy disjointed, struggling to make our way in a new world outside the EU. ""Or we can come together as one United Kingdom, confidently seizing new global opportunities as we build a prosperous, secure nation fit for the future challenges we will face."" The UK Government has said it will pursue a policy of putting Britain outside a customs union with the EU but matching Brussels rules in certain sectors in an attempt to achieve ""frictionless"" trade. Donald Tusk, who on Saturday claimed Mrs May's Brexit plan was ""based on pure illusion"", will meet the Prime Minister in No 10 for talks on Thursday lunchtime. At a news conference on Friday, Mr Tusk said: ""It looks like the cake philosophy is still alive. From the very start it has been a key principle of the EU 27 that there can be no cherry-picking and no single market a la carte. ""This is, and will continue to be, a key principle, I have no doubt."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is due to deliver a speech on Monday setting out his party's Brexit approach. But a letter backed by more than 80 senior Labour figures warned the leader his plans for investment in schools, hospitals and social care risk being unaffordable unless the UK stays in the EU single market. Mrs May's latest statement echoes words used by former Conservative prime minister Harold Macmillan who famously told Britons they had ""never had it so good"". In 1957, in a speech urging pay restraint and warning against inflation, he told Tory supporters: ""You will see a state of prosperity such as we have never had in my lifetime - nor indeed in the history of this country."" Six years later, after leading the Conservatives to election victory in 1959, his government was badly harmed by the Profumo Affair and was deposed in 1964."
2018-02-25,"Henry Bolton became leader 142 days ago. And for 142 days in the sun, he has lost, more or less everything.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180225151009/https://news.sky.com/story/whither-ousted-ukip-leader-henry-bolton-11255778,"He has lost his wife, his family, his day job and today he lost the leadership of the party which had thrust him into the spotlight. When he became leader, 142 days ago, I was in the hall in Torquay. I remember that he was elected on a promise to professionalise the party. When I asked him, a few days ago, how that was going, he could only wince. Instead of professionalisation, his leadership has seen the party sink to new lows of infighting and humiliation. After the revelations of his mistress Jo Marney's racism, he received a unanimous vote of no confidence in his leadership from the party's National Executive Committee. Since then he has experienced the undoing of his private life and intense media scrutiny, which he compared to me as akin to that endured by Princess Diana. He hoped he could survive. Going into the make or break meeting, I was told that he had good reason to be hopeful. Nigel Farage had backed him; he had coachloads of supporters being brought in and he had apparently re-geared the race into a referendum on the unpopular NEC. Yet in the end, it wasn't even close. What happened? The media were banned from the meeting itself but sources who were inside tell me that to some extent, Mr Bolton lost it on the day. He made a bellicose speech which barely mentioned the allegations against him. He appeared ""arrogant"" and ""without contrition"". He launched a blistering attack on the NEC which he slammed as: ""The enemy within. The only loyalty these people have is to themselves. Their actions are despicable."" Mr Bolton's opponents were equally unforgiving. Sources tell me that Steve Crowther, former acting leader, speaking on behalf of the NEC, was scathing, ""going hard on Bolton lying to his family and wife"". Mr Crowther said: ""It is not that he has done wrong but that he refuses to accept that he has done wrong. ""It is not about the morality of what he has done but his political judgement. He has developed a reputation for being unreachable and always late. He is also a liar."" He then accused Mr Bolton of telling untruths about his CV. Up to then the forces seemed evenly balanced, with both sides being booed and heckled. The game-changer came when Paul Oakley, general-secretary of the party, addressed the crowd and revealed that Mr Bolton had only days before threatened to try and stop the Emergency General Meeting with legal action. In his right of reply, Mr Bolton did not deny this but indeed threatened it again. This did not go down well with the undecided voters. Threatening to sue your own party is not a good look. At that moment a source texted me: ""He's a goner."" The meeting was bitter and nasty but the rebels succeeded and Mr Bolton is gone. But for how much longer? On Thursday, Mr Bolton confirmed to me that he ""had three options"" if he lost. Today he confirmed to me that he was considering running for leader again. He said: ""You can't keep a good man down. You certainly haven't heard the last of me in politics."" He might well run again, there is nothing to prohibit him from doing so under the party's rules. He received 37% of the no-confidence vote. Under the UKIP's First Past the Post electoral system, he need not get a majority of the votes in a leadership contest, just one more than the second placed candidate. Talking to those in the hall, he clearly has supporters who would rally to his cause again. Senior UKIP figures are disparaging of the prospect. Welsh leader Neil Hamilton told me ""that he might well run, as he's shown he's no stranger to humiliation"". Gerard Batten, the interim leader, said that if he is thinking about it Mr Bolton should ""get a life"". But as a senior UKIP source told me: ""He might well do it, because he's lost everything else."" He is chasing the dying of the light. Whatever happens to Mr Bolton, his is a sorry tale but UKIP's story could be sorrier still. It is now on its seventh leader in 18 months. It faces the prospect of another leadership election which it cannot afford. It heads into a set of local elections where it is defending hundreds of seats, with no permanent leader. There are even rumours that its great hero Mr Farage - his spell over the apparently party broken - might set up a new party with former donor Aaron Banks. One woman will be relieved: Theresa May. The hardest proponents of the hardest Brexit are off the battlefield. That gives her breathing space on her Eurosceptic flank. In the end, UKIP have simply lost their reason to be. Like Del Boy after he finally became a millionaire, now their lifetime ambition of Brexit has been achieved, they just do not quite know quite what to do with themselves. The sticking plaster, which bound this disparate band of libertarians, social conservatives, economic protectionists, working class socialists and shire Tories together, has been ripped off. There's not much left. UKIP have been written off before. But in Birmingham, the stench of death is everywhere. As one source texted me as we all headed for home: ""Dead within a year, I reckon."""

Sky News was granted exclusive access to Burnley's Turf Moor stadium to see the new Surface Guard system in action. A team of around a dozen security contractors were able to erect two barriers on the main access road to the stadium within half an hour. The barrier sections are linked together, spanning the width of the roadway. They are designed to give pedestrians easy access through them, but reinforced metal rods stop any hostile vehicle trying to penetrate the barriers. Across the private security sector, a number of companies are looking to develop their own, more easily deployable barrier systems. Sky News spoke to half a dozen UK based security firms. All said that there was currently unprecedented demand for their security products, following the recent spate of vehicle attacks in Europe and North America. Burnley FC said its fans had reacted positively to the introduction of the Surface Guard barrier system. Doug Metcalfe, operations manager at Burnley, said: ""We, as a nation, are in a different situation. ""The terrorist threat is real and is probably here to stay for some time. ""It's important for us to do the right thing. ""We have a duty of care for our supporters and doing the right thing means enhancing the protection we offer with barrier systems like this one. ""When our supporters arrive here they can enjoy the game safe in the knowledge that they are better protected."" Unlike the more cumbersome semi-permanent concrete and metal barriers, which have been deployed around a number of London landmarks, the Surface Guard system is only deployed when needed. Gavin Hepburn, from the barrier's designers ATG Access, said: ""The changing method of terrorist attacks means you need to protect places, but the most important thing of all, you've got to protect the people. ""I think this system makes it accessible to anyone, even those planning a relatively small event can still have mitigation against a vehicle attack. ""It can be erected in less than an hour and dismantled just as quickly."" Security consultant Chris Philips said the development of this more portable system was ""revolutionary and a leap forward in barrier protection, compared to the current barriers which are ugly and unmanageable"". He added: ""You can't deploy them easily, so when those massive concrete and metal blocks are assembled, they're often left there for years."" Chelsea is among the latest group of Premier League clubs reported to be considering deploying the new barriers. But those within the security sector know that, at best, this is a temporary solution. With attack methodology constantly evolving, staying one step ahead of the terrorist is extremely challenging."

After eight hours of talks with her inner Brexit cabinet at Chequers, the Prime Minister emerged with a fragile peace deal and plan for Britain's future relationship with the EU.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180225151009/https://news.sky.com/story/theresa-mays-brexit-talks-deal-brings-fragile-peace-to-warring-tories-11264273,"No one stormed out in protest as the Prime Minister managed to stitch together a compromise deal hooked on ""managed divergence"". All sides emerged content, with lead Remainer Philip Hammond ""relaxed and pleased"" and Boris Johnson ""positive"" too. The details will be fleshed out Mrs May's keynote speech next week, but some sketchy details are emerging about the essence of that deal. :: EU boss calls UK's Brexit position 'an illusion' Sky News understands that the inner Brexit cabinet agreed three main principles on Thursday night. First, the UK will seek an agreement on ""mutual recognition on goods standards"" and then maintain those standards after Brexit - effectively ensuring UK rules and standards remain closely aligned to those of the EU to ensure continuing smooth trade. The Brexit cabinet also signed off on a proposal for ""equal dispute settlement arrangements"" to reassure MPs that European courts will not have power over the UK and, third, agreed the principle that Britain would have the ""right to diverge"" from EU rules. :: Will Brexit slaughter the prospects for Welsh lamb?  It all sounds very technical and dry, but at its heart this deal is an attempt by Mrs May to offer something to both sides of her fractured party. For the Brexiteers, the broad agreement on the need for divergence is an important staging post on their journey to secure a ""Canada plus-plus-plus"" style free trade deal unshackled from the customs union and single market. :: May facing fresh Commons Brexit rebellion And for fellow Remainers, there is clear reassurance that the starting point is close UK-EU alignment that you move away from when you ""feel it's the right thing to do"". But the tensions within her party are never far from the surface, with trouble brewing on both sides even as she brokered that deal at her country retreat in Buckinghamshire. Team Brexit is fuming over No 10's handling of a letter - signed by more than 60 MPs - from the powerful European Research Group setting out its demands for a clean break from the EU. MPs told me this week that four junior members of government - parliamentary aides to ministers - were hauled in by the whips and given a dressing down for signing the letter. ""Some have been threatened and bullied and told they will lose their jobs,"" said one senior source. ""There is no good grace at all."" :: Blair urges Labour revolt over customs union Meanwhile, on Team Remain former ministers Anna Soubry and Nicky Morgan are leading a rebellion to keep Britain in the customs union. Five senior backbenchers have already put their name to a cross-party amendment that could inflict a Government defeat, and believe that figure could rise to at least a dozen. The amendment, tabled on Friday, comes amid growing expectations that Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is preparing to shift Labour's position to support the UK remaining in the customs union in a keynote speech on Monday. Ms Soubry told Sky News last night that she hoped a change in the Labour frontbench position would not deter Tory rebels from supporting the amendment. ""I always said this was bigger than this [party politics] stuff; that is why I tabled this amendment today,"" she said. But, for now, Mrs May has navigated another turn on the perilous road to Brexit. The next hairpin bend arrives on Friday when she makes that all-important Brexit speech."

The 28-year-old snowboarder, from Southampton, joins Lizzy Yarnold, who won gold in the skeleton, Laura Deas and Dom Parsons, who both won bronze in the skeleton and Izzy Atkin who won bronze in the ski slopestyle. There were scenes of jubilation as Morgan realised he had secured a medal in big air, which involves pulling off the most impressive airborne trick possible after jumping off a giant ramp. He had only just squeezed into the final 12 in the event and scored 168 with his two jumps but was aided by the failure of some of his rivals to successfully land twice. Morgan's third place was behind gold medallist Sebastien Toutant of Canada and Kyle Mack of the United States, who claimed silver. He was only 6.25 points behind Toutant and 0.75 behind Mack. The event was watched by Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka, who cheered on her second-placed compatriot. The big air event was making its Olympic debut in South Korea, with Austrian Anna Gasser winning the women's gold medal on Thursday. Team GB, who are currently 18th in the medal table, had set themselves the target of achieving five medals. There is still a chance of at least one more medal if the women curlers are able to take bronze in the playoff for third after the team lost to Sweden in the semi final on Friday. Morgan didn't take up snowboarding until he was 17 and only embarked on his first full winter on snow at 17. In January 2012, a video of his performing a snowboarding trick attracted more than one million YouTube views. He is a social media star for his stunts, which include being the first to perform four flips and five full rotations. But he is no stranger to conventional media either, having posed wearing just his snowboard boots and his board for a national newspaper feature ahead of the Games."
2018-02-25,"Journalist Sali Hughes founded Beauty Banks together with PR Jo Jones, after learning of the extent of hygiene poverty in the UK. Here, she tells the story behind the project:",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180225151009/https://news.sky.com/story/beauty-banks-someone-will-feel-fresher-cleaner-better-because-of-you-11264679,"When you go to the supermarket, have you ever had to consider whether you can afford a box of tampons? Or had to choose between buying toothpaste or food? And when your toothbrush is worn or razor blunt, do you replace it with a new one, or have to make do for longer than is healthy? These are decisions most of us don't consciously make, but for some 13 million Britons living in poverty, they're a daily reality. Simple, everyday toiletries like shower gel, tampons, towels, razors, soap, shampoo, deodorant, represent the costly choice between keeping clean and eating. :: The toiletry equivalent to food banks takes off My colleague Jo Jones' and my decision to launch Beauty Banks, a non-profit collective of beauty professionals attempting to combat hygiene poverty, was the result of several shocking or upsetting moments. We both knew teachers who were routinely taking sanitary protection in for their most hard-up female pupils, so that those girls could come in to school and learn during a period. We'd both read a report by charity In Kind Direct that identified ""hygiene poverty"" as ""a hidden crisis"" in Britain, and one that's growing fast. A lack of basic toiletries is such a big concern for their recipient charities (such as food banks) that In Kind Direct distributed £2.2m worth of products to them last year – a rise of 67% on 2016. We each read reports of men and women rising at 5am to go to a homeless shelter for a shower and a clothes wash, before heading off to work for an eight-hour shift. In 2018 Britain, it just wasn’t, and isn’t, good enough. But our talks became more urgent this last winter, when some friends and I slept rough on London’s Greenwich Peninsula to raise money for homeless charity Centrepoint. Despite having been homeless myself as a teenager, I had never slept on the street before, and while nothing could ever truly replicate the horror of the real thing, neither could anything have prepared me for how dreadful I felt the next morning, at 6.30am, when we were told to get up and move on, without so much as a comb through the hair or a brush of the teeth. It was too cold to change our underwear, our clothes were muddy and there was nowhere to wash. Our breath and hair smelled and all of us went straight home to cry in a hot bath. I was acutely aware that many people don't have that option. To feel dirty, to be conscious of one's own odour, is to feel bad. People living in poverty - whether in their own homes, in temporary accommodation or on the streets - deserve the same basic dignity and self care that everyone else enjoys. No one should suffer the indignity of not being able to shave for a job interview, or of attending school without proper period protection, and nor should anyone have to skip washing to feed their kids. We shouldn’t accept it for others. We should help them. And so, in Beauty Banks, Jo and I are asking the beauty industry and the beauty community, as well as members of the public, to send us their unused toiletries so that we can sort and pack large care packs for food banks and homeless shelters across Britain. You can help by collecting together anything new and useful, from babies' toothbrushes to men's shaving gel, from soap to roll-on. When you've gathered together enough for a parcel and removed any restricted solvents (perfume and nail polish), pack it all into a box and kindly write ""Beauty Banks"" on every side of it, then post to: BEAUTY BANKSc/o JO JONESTHE COMMUNICATIONS STORE2 KENSINGTON SQUARELONDON W8 5EP If you'd like to avoid post office queues and fees, you can buy us anything from boots.com, superdrug.com and amazon.co.uk (our wish list is here) and get it sent direct to us. In any case, we will make sure they reach someone who desperately wants and needs them - someone who will feel fresher, cleaner, better, because of you."

Unless the government provided more money, we were like a third world nation, he said. That Winter Olympics cycle ended, in 2002, with just two medals at the Games in Salt Lake City. Sixteen years on, public funding has indeed been pumped up - to more than £28m - and despite injuries to key competitors, the British haul from Pyeonchang is five - the best ever. It matched the target set by UK Sport, which allocates cash for Olympic sports. Two cheers at least, then? It depends, as ever, on how you view it, and on those perennially devilish details. To an extent, in keeping with the modern sporting world, you get what you pay for (there is a strong correlation in the Premier League, for instance, between the wages table and the clubs' actual finishing positions). So skeleton, which receives more than any other winter sport, delivered three of those five medals, easily exceeding its target. And TVs in plenty of homes and offices were indeed tuned to Lizzy Yarnold and her teammates hurling themselves head first down a dangerous ice chute - achieving gold for her and two bronzes. There was, no doubt, a (brief) lift to the national mood. However, all but the tiniest percentage of viewers will forget about it all for four more years. And if you were inspired to go out and try it yourself, there is nowhere in the UK for you to do so. Moreover, a look behind the overall ""target met"" headline reveals that every other sport bar one missed its UK Sport prediction. The exception was ski and snowboard, which was set - and achieved - two medals. Good things are happening here. When I sat down in November with British Ski and Snowboard's chief executive Dan Hunt, a calm and experienced sports boss, he wanted to talk less about Pyeonchang and more about his vision to make Britain a top five nation by 2030. No snow? No problem. Billy Morgan, whose big air bronze was Britain's target-reaching fifth in Pyeonchang, learned snowboarding on a dry slope in Southampton. And Hunt's team are hunting down athletes who don't quite make international standard in other sports like gymnastics, hoping to turn them into stars of the modern, ""cool"" acrobatic snow events. Similarly, Yarnold is a converted heptathlete. British winter sport is serious about being competitive, and has earned respect internationally. It can carry on doing so only if the money bags remain open. A meeting next month will start UK Sport's funding review. Ought skeleton, for instance, to continue receiving the multimillions while basketball (more accessible, more inclusive but lacking foreseeable medal potential) gets nothing at elite level? Difficult questions, no easy answers."

Jeremy Corbyn will announce the shift in Labour's Brexit policy during a speech on Monday, following ""many weeks of discussion"" within the party, Sir Keir added. The move will pile pressure on the Prime Minister, with Sir Keir suggesting Labour could now back an attempt by Tory rebels to force the Government into agreeing a similar position. So far, Theresa May has ruled out entering any form of customs union with the EU after Brexit, as she faces demands from her Leave-supporting MPs not to hinder the UK's ability to pursue an independent trade policy after quitting the bloc. :: The real reason for Labour's Brexit shift :: What you need to know about customs union Sir Keir claimed Labour had ""long championed being in a customs union with the EU and the benefits of that"". ""It's really important for our manufacturing base and nobody can answer the question how you keep your commitment to no hard border in Northern Ireland without a customs union,"" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. Sir Keir said Labour had ""unanimously"" agreed at a meeting last week to ""develop"" their Brexit policy. He said: ""It's a customs union… there's going to have to be a new agreement, but will it do the work of the current customs union? Yes, that's the intention."" Sir Keir admitted Labour's position means it will have to be ""negotiated"" as to who is in control of Britain's trade policy after Brexit. He said: ""We will have to have a say but the real point is - because we all want trade agreements, we all want more trade agreements - are we more likely to get them if we do it jointly with the EU or on our own? ""All the evidence suggests more likely if we do it with the EU and the cost-benefit analysis of coming out of the customs union and having new trade agreements just isn't borne out."" Tory Remainer Anna Soubry has tabled a cross-party amendment to the Trade Bill in an attempt to compel the Government to retain a customs union with the EU after leaving the bloc. Heightening the prospect of a parliamentary defeat on the issue for Mrs May, Sir Keir suggested Labour could back Ms Soubry's move. However, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox hinted the Prime Minister's own speech on Brexit this week could appease potential Conservative rebels. It follows an away-day of Mrs May's Brexit ""war Cabinet"" last week, where they thrashed out the UK's approach to the next phase of Brexit negotiations. Dr Fox said: ""We sat down with those differing views, we set out the issues, we looked at the options and we came to an agreement that we are all happy with."" Asked what his message would be to Tory Remainers, he added: ""I hope that they will have an open mind and listen to what the Prime Minister says because I think that what the Prime Minister will set out will deal with a lot of the reservations that they have."" Former Cabinet minister Nicky Morgan, who is among those Tory MPs supporting Ms Soubry's amendment, insisted remaining in a customs union with the EU is ""perfectly possible"". She told ITV this would mean ""we don't have to have a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland"" but - if the UK followed a Turkey-style customs agreement with the EU - Britain would still be able to ""negotiate free trade agreements in relation to many other different areas"". Yet, Mrs May is not the only party leader now facing pressure over the issue of a post-Brexit customs union. Labour Brexiteer Kate Hoey expressed concern backing a customs union with the EU would mean the party ""going into the next election saying we don't want to have our own trade policy"". She told Sky News' Sunday with Niall Paterson: ""I don't understand how we can have a customs union that would still give us the freedom to be able to make our own trade deals. ""When you think how long it's taken the EU to get trade deals, they still haven't got them with China, with America."" Ms Hoey suggested a ""growing group of people"" are now trying to find a way where the UK will leave the EU ""in name only""."

Labour said it would not let ""dangerous lies"" about Mr Corbyn go unchallenged. A spokesman for the Opposition leader said: ""We are pleased Ben Bradley has admitted what he said was entirely untrue and apologised, and that charities in Mansfield will benefit. ""Following the botched smear campaign against Jeremy, this case shows we are not going to let dangerous lies go unchallenged."" While Mr Corbyn's office acknowledged that he had met a Czech diplomat for tea in the Commons, they said any claim he was ""an agent, asset or informer for any intelligence agency is entirely false and a ridiculous smear"". It comes after a former spy chief insisted Mr Corbyn did have ""questions to answer"" over his Cold War links. Sir Richard Dearlove said the Labour leader should have ""taken care to avoid"" meeting a Czech agent and cannot just ""laugh off"" the claims. The ex-MI6 boss said holding only a couple of meetings with Jan Sarkocy would amount to ""stupidity"", but if the spy's claims that many more took place were true then ""this affair takes on a completely different aspect"". Labour said Sir Richard should not be ""trying to give credence to these entirely false and ridiculous smears""."

Both boys died after being taken to hospital. A damaged black Ford Focus was found a short time after the crash. Robert Brown, 53, and Gwendoline Harrison, 41, have been charged under joint enterprise of two counts of causing death by dangerous driving, West Midlands Police said. Brown, of Attwood Crescent, Wyken, is also charged with driving while disqualified, no insurance and otherwise than in accordance with a licence, while Harrison, of Triumph Close, Wyken, faces a common assault allegation. They appeared at Coventry Magistrates' Court, sitting at Leamington Justice Centre. Corey and Casper's mother Louise Platt-May paid tribute to the boys following their deaths. She described Corey as ""an amazing boy"" who had a passion for football, while his younger brother Casper was a ""cheeky little boy"" whose ""smile could light up any room"". The boys' aunt Chelsea Platt-May told Sky News they had been on the way to a family day out at the park at the time of the collision. ""I hope - it sounds horrible to say - they didn't suffer and I hope they were going with happy thoughts and not thoughts of pain,"" she said. Both boys were taken to hospital with severe injuries. Casper could not be revived and died a short time later. Corey died despite undergoing surgery. Family and friends have launched a number of fundraising pages to help their parents. Corey's football coach Matthew Hopkins told Sky News he was unsure how the youngsters' teammates would react. ""I won't be able to say 'good tackle Corey', 'good pass Corey' or 'good goal Corey.' That's really sad,"" he said. Detective Sergeant Paul Hughes said: ""It is always tragic to lose loved ones, especially when so young, and we are continuing to offer our support to family members at such a devastating time. ""We are very appreciative of the overwhelming help we have received from the public during our investigations to date and we continue to ask anyone with information who has not already spoken to us to get in touch with us."""
2018-02-25,Rapper Stormzy has continued his battle with the Prime Minister over the Grenfell Tower fire by urging support for a bid to overhaul an inquiry into the tragedy.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180225151009/https://news.sky.com/story/rapper-stormzy-continues-battle-with-theresa-may-over-grenfell-tower-fire-11264438,"The grime and hip hop star called on his more than one million Twitter followers to sign a petition demanding Theresa May use her powers to appoint additional panel members to the independent public inquiry. Within a few hours of his tweet, the petition had registered more than 100,000 signatures - the number required for the petition to be considered for debate by MPs. It was started by Adel Chaoui, who lost four relatives in the blaze and wants a more diverse make-up to the inquiry. Alongside a link to the online petition, Stormzy (real name Michael Omari) wrote on Twitter: ""This needs 100,000 signatures if you could please sign, share, RT and spread the word on it."" He later urged people to ""pleaseeeee don't be paigon"", using a slang term for someone who does nothing and a word he has previously used to describe Mrs May. This needs 100,000 signatures if you could please sign, share, RT and spread the word on it. https://t.co/zpSE3qy2bq ðŸ™?ðŸ?¿â?¤ï¸? The petition, which was previously delivered to Downing Street, calls for the Prime Minister to appoint additional panel members with decision-making power to sit alongside retired judge Sir Martin Moore-Bick, who is the chair of the Grenfell Tower inquiry. It states such a move is ""fundamental"" to ""avoid a collapse of confidence in the inquiry's ability to discover the truth"" of the tragedy. The panel members ""must be appointed with relevant background, expertise, experience and a real understanding of the issues facing those affected"", it adds. The petition also calls for legal representatives of victims' families to ""see all evidence from the start"" of the inquiry and be ""allowed to question witnesses at the hearings"". Earlier this week, Stormzy used his appearance at the BRIT Awards to question the Mrs May's response to the Grenfell Tower disaster, which took the lives of 71 people. In a politically-charged performance, Stormzy rapped: ""Yo Theresa May, where's the money for Grenfell? ""What, you thought we just forgot about Grenfell? You criminals, and you've got the cheek to call us savages, you should do some jail time, you should pay some damages, you should burn your house down and see if you can manage this."" In response, Downing Street insisted the Prime Minister is ""absolutely committed"" to supporting those affected by the devastating tower block blaze in north Kensington, west London, last June. The appointment of Sir Martin to chair the public inquiry into the disaster proved controversial after local residents questioned his ability to relate to survivors. He has appointed seven expert witnesses and three assessors to help with his work. Late last year, Mrs May was criticised after she rejected the request from Grenfell survivors - after the petition now being promoted by Stormzy was delivered to Downing Street - to appoint additional panel members. Under the Inquiries Act 2005, only the Prime Minister has the power to change an inquiry's format. In a formal response to the petition, triggered by its reaching 10,000 signatures, the Government said: ""Having regard to the terms of reference and the assistance to be provided by the assessors, and the expert witnesses, it is the Prime Minister's view that the inquiry panel has the necessary expertise to undertake the Inquiry as it is currently constituted."" Grenfell families criticised the timing of Mrs May's announcement of her decision on the last working day before Christmas."

Companies which have pulled out of NRA promotions include airlines United and Delta, internet security brands such as Symantec and Norton Antivirus; car hire firms Hertz, Alamo and National; identity theft protection company Lifelock; and First National Bank. Symantec has stopped its discount program with the National Rifle Association. United said it was ending a discount it has offered for travel to the NRA's annual meeting. Delta announced it would be ending its contract with the NRA for discounted rates for group travel. Several of the 27 firms listed as associated with the NRA by website Think Progress have announced they have cut ties with the organisation. Many more not featured on the site, including Best Western and Wyndham Hotels, have also ended their relationship with the group. :: Florida school shooting survivor ""unimpressed"" by Trump The push comes in the wake of the deadliest school shooting in America's history in Parkland, Florida, where 17 teenagers were murdered by a classmate armed with an AR-15 rifle. Outrage following the massacre has prompted widespread protest both in the streets and online, in many cases spearheaded by young people directly affected by the killings. The campaign targeting brands gained momentum on Thursday and Friday, with hashtags such as #BoycottNRA and #DisarmtheNRA being used on social media. Twitter users told corporate accounts they would stop buying from firms that maintained promotional collaborations with the NRA, which are designed to make the $40 annual subscription to the association more enticing for gun owners.

I did all the hard work for you:https://t.co/2atkHG80dl. One user, who created a template urging Amazon to drop its NRA links, said 250,000 people had contacted the group in less than 24 hours. First National Bank, which ran what was termed the ""official credit card"" of the NRA, offered discounts, rewards and a bank card co-branded with the rifle association. It cited ""customer feedback"" as the reason for the turnaround, telling Twitter users that it would ""not renew its contract with the National Rifle Association to issue the NRA visa card"". :: Armed officer did not confront Florida school gunman Customer feedback has caused us to review our relationship with the NRA.  As a result, First National Bank of Omaha will not renew its contract with the National Rifle Association to issue the NRA Visa Card. We have notified the NRA that we are ending the NRA’s rental car discount program with Hertz. However, not all the companies linked to the NRA have dropped their links. Apple and Amazon are being called on by activists to drop their hosting of the NRA TV app. Hotel Planner also still appears to be operating with the organisation, as well as FedEx, which gives NRA members discounts on shipping fees. The NRA did not respond to Sky News' request for comment. However, on Friday it tweeted that ""people should take a hard look at the number of failures by the FBI and local law enforcement agencies"" rather than gun campaigners. The head of the lobby group, which has around five million members, said on Thursday that gun control advocates ""hate individual freedom""."

Prado was escorted by 50 commandos and agents of various police agencies as he was handed over to the US authorities. Police say Prado, also known by the alias ""Gerald"", ran the most sophisticated smuggling route on the Pacific coast of South America. They compared it to Pablo Escobar's Medellin cartel of three decades ago because it sought to dominate the entire cocaine supply chain from production to its distribution in the US. Police say Prado and his gang sent as many as 10 speedboats a week that each carried around a ton of cocaine. It is alleged that Prado began as a boatman running drugs along Ecuador's coast and rose to become head of a small army of smugglers spread across five countries. Police said that in Ecuador he had records for drug trafficking, migrant smuggling and murder and is accused of ordering attacks against judges, prosecutors and police officers who were investigating him. Prado and three of his main partners were arrested in Colombia in April 2017. He will face trial in a court in Florida charged with conspiracy and drug trafficking. The US Drug Enforcement Agency provided Colombia police with intelligence that led to the arrest of Prado and his accomplices."

The pair, who both work in the beauty industry, were appalled by what is sometimes known as period poverty. So, less than two weeks ago, they started Beauty Banks - the toiletry and beauty product equivalent to food banks. Ms Jones said: ""I just believe that everyone should be able to have a clean body, clean hair, go to school with deodorant on. ""For me, it's a dignity thing. It's about self-pride, self-care and self-confidence. Of course, you can't eat a deodorant, but these products are a dignity issue. ""We're just collecting products and sending them to the people who can distribute them to those in need. ""We were so aware of the amount of waste there is, particularly in the beauty industry, this is about us galvanising our contacts, as well as appealing to individuals [for donations]. ""We're just volunteers, we're a non-profit organisation, we're not a charity, we don't have any long term goals apart from getting the items out to people."" The scheme aims to provide essentials like soap, shampoo, tampons, sanitary towels, deodorant, toothbrushes and toothpaste and also items such as lipstick or moisturiser which can have a positive impact on someone's self-confidence. In a short space of time, support for the idea has snowballed. Ms Jones showed Sky News the area of her office at the Communications Store where her boss has allowed parcels to be sent; there's a mini-mountain of packages. Some are from beauty brands; most are from members of the public and contain notes praising what the girls and their friends are doing. She added: ""Most women have, well, we call it the graveyard cupboard, you just chuck all your beauty products in there and forget about them. ""We can only take unused products for safety issues, but we all scoop up things like free toothbrushes on airline travel, they're actually really good for homeless people because they're moving around a lot."" Ms Hughes said it's about helping people to feel human. ""There's a huge link between self-care, good grooming and mental health,"" she said. ""Feeling like you don't smell the same as everyone else, standing out in that way, is not good for your mental health. ""Food banks are reporting that over half of their users are foregoing essential toiletries to eat. That's ridiculous. ""It's nothing for us to buy some extra tampons or sanitary towels but, actually, in real terms, that can mean a girl going to school knowing she's adequately protected."" Ms Hughes said the response they've received has been overwhelming. ""We thought we may get a couple of dozen packages, what we didn't expect is pallets and pallets of stuff arriving every day and that's a brilliant problem to have,"" she added. ""We're thrilled. The food banks are so pleased. ""We're already in Milton Keynes, Cardiff and Liverpool and we're hoping to edge further out."" St Paul's Church in Stratford runs one of the food banks that has already benefited from the boxes. Reverend Jeremy Fraser said having the extra products has been a ""godsend"". ""It is sadly really needed,"" he said. ""A lot of people are living quite tight lives on their money, so when things start to go wrong they go wrong really quickly. ""These items are a luxury in one sense, but actually if you are going to be human you need some things around you that mean you are going to be clean, that your clothes are clean. ""If I'm going to feel human in the morning having toothpaste and a toothbrush makes all the difference. ""If I was a woman then I'd want tampons. It's basic things that make us value people and honour them and not them treat them like they're less than us - because they're not... actually any one of us could be there one day."""

She died on Saturday in Dubai after suffering a heart attack, her brother-in-law Sanjay Kapoor told the Indian Express. Her most famous roles included playing a reporter in Mr India and in Chandni, when she played a woman choosing between two suitors. In Lamhe, in 1991, she played dual roles of a woman and her daughter. Much of her appeal was that she appeared in films in a wide variety of Indian languages, having been born into a Tamil/Telugu family in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Born Shree Amma Yanger Ayyapan, she started in the industry at the age of four and worked throughout her childhood, playing her first adult Bollywood role at the age of 13. She won five Filmfare Awards, and was nominated 10 times in the Indian equivalent to the Oscars. In 2013, she was awarded the Padma Shri by the Indian government, the fourth highest civilian honour. In the same year, she was voted India’s Greatest Actress in 100 Years, in a national poll to celebrate a centenary of Indian cinema. When ‘Chandni’ lit up #Umang with her smiles!

She stopped acting after her second marriage but made a well-received comeback in 2012 with English Vinglish, about a woman learning English. It is understood she was at a wedding with her husband and daughter at the time of her death. Fans and fellow Bollywood stars left tributes to the actress on Twitter and other social media. The Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted: ""Saddened by the untimely demise of noted actor Sridevi. She was a veteran of the film industry, whose long career included diverse roles and memorable performances. My thoughts are with her family and admirers in this hour of grief. May her soul rest in peace."" London Mayor Sadiq Khan said: ""Really enjoyed meeting Bollywood icon Sri Devi on my recent trip to India.

His eldest son Miles also died of a heart attack at the age of 31 less than two years later with no warning of health problems beforehand. Genetic testing after Miles died revealed that Sir David had passed on a rare condition called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) which can remain undetected until a sudden cardiac arrest. Former Bolton Wanderers footballer Fabrice Muamba is another high profile person who has the condition. He collapsed on the pitch at Tottenham's White Hart Lane during an FA Cup quarter-final in 2012. He has since stopped competitive sport and helped to raise awareness of HCM. Through the Miles Frost Fund, Sir David's family has raised £1.5m, boosting funding for six inherited heart condition centres across the UK. It's hoped that thousands more patients at risk of deadly inherited heart conditions will now be screened each year following the rollout of the genetic testing service by the family and the British Heart Foundation. The Frost family said: ""Miles' death was absolutely devastating for all the family. But what made it all the more tragic was finding out that it could have been avoided. That knowledge motivated us to launch the Miles Frost Fund to raise money and awareness so that other families have access to testing and don't go through the same heartache that we did."" A total of 14 new Miles Frost Fund/BHF specialist cardiac genetic nurses, genetic counsellors and family history co-ordinators have already been appointed, seeing an additional 800 people each year. The BHF estimates that up to 120,000 people across the UK could be living with HCM and a total of 600,000 people could be carrying a similar faulty gene that puts them at high risk of having a cardiac arrest or heart attack, with no obvious cause or explanation. Dr Anna Michell, Principal Genetic Counsellor in Inherited Cardiac Conditions at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, said: ""As genetic counsellors we seek to provide support, information and advice to families as they go through the process of genetic tests for conditions such as HCM. ""This funding has allowed us to increase capacity in our busy clinic, ensuring that more families can be referred for testing nearer to home and supported through a life-changing diagnosis."""

The Met Office has issued early warnings for snow, which were upgraded to amber, meaning there is an ""increased likelihood of bad weather, which could potentially disrupt your plans and cause travel delays, interruption to power and the potential risk to life and property"". There is the potential for some eastern areas to see around 20cm of snowfall by the end of Wednesday. :: LIVE: Britain braces for 'beastly' freeze In addition, we have some seriously cold air filtering into the country, which will ensure that daytime temperatures will struggle to break freezing this week. Add to that a moderate or strong wind and the resulting windchill merits a Level Three alert for cold weather, which is of sufficient severity as to be a threat to health. Some eastern counties will awake to a covering of snow, some to a sprinkle. Some may miss it altogether but those snow showers will just keep going. They will become heavier and more frequent, and they will become more widespread too - pushing into central areas. One or two isolated showers may even pop up in the west. For most western parts however, there will be a dry bright cold start, only marred by cloud bubbling up over time. Tonight will see a penetrating frost with snow showers becoming heavier especially across southeast England and the Thames Estuary along with southern Scotland and northern England. Tuesday and Wednesday will bring further showers, and some more persistent snow belts which will push southwestwards across the country through the day. Temperatures will be zero or below and the fresh winds will make it feel perishing. Windchill will be especially severe along Channel coasts. Thursday will offer a little respite for the south-east with brightening skies as the heaviest weather moves into the north-east.

2018-02-26,"A number of Premier League clubs will meet this week to discuss whether to introduce a ""revolutionary"" new anti-terror barrier at their grounds.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180226155417/https://news.sky.com/story/premier-league-considers-new-anti-terror-barrier-11266585,"Burnley and Manchester United are already using the portable barriers, which security experts have described as a ""leap forward"" in protection against vehicle-borne attacks. The system is designed by a UK company, after the Government challenged the security sector to come up with a barrier concept which could be easily deployed and quickly dismantled. Sky News was granted exclusive access to Burnley's Turf Moor stadium to see the new Surface Guard system in action. A team of around a dozen security contractors were able to erect two barriers on the main access road to the stadium within half an hour. The barrier sections are linked together, spanning the width of the roadway. They are designed to give pedestrians easy access through them, but reinforced metal rods stop any hostile vehicle trying to penetrate the barriers. Across the private security sector, a number of companies are looking to develop their own, more easily deployable barrier systems. Sky News spoke to half a dozen UK based security firms. All said that there was currently unprecedented demand for their security products, following the recent spate of vehicle attacks in Europe and North America. Burnley FC said its fans had reacted positively to the introduction of the Surface Guard barrier system. Doug Metcalfe, operations manager at Burnley, said: ""We, as a nation, are in a different situation. ""The terrorist threat is real and is probably here to stay for some time. ""It's important for us to do the right thing. ""We have a duty of care for our supporters and doing the right thing means enhancing the protection we offer with barrier systems like this one. ""When our supporters arrive here they can enjoy the game safe in the knowledge that they are better protected."" Unlike the more cumbersome semi-permanent concrete and metal barriers, which have been deployed around a number of London landmarks, the Surface Guard system is only deployed when needed. Gavin Hepburn, from the barrier's designers ATG Access, said: ""The changing method of terrorist attacks means you need to protect places, but the most important thing of all, you've got to protect the people. ""I think this system makes it accessible to anyone, even those planning a relatively small event can still have mitigation against a vehicle attack. ""It can be erected in less than an hour and dismantled just as quickly."" Security consultant Chris Philips said the development of this more portable system was ""revolutionary and a leap forward in barrier protection, compared to the current barriers which are ugly and unmanageable"". He added: ""You can't deploy them easily, so when those massive concrete and metal blocks are assembled, they're often left there for years.""

But Brexiteer Frank Field accused him of setting out demands that ""the whole country would vote for because he knows it's impossible to deliver"". He said the EU would never accept the proposal, declaring: ""It is not deliverable."" Mr Field is one of the few Brexiteer Labour MPs, whose lack of support for an amendment to the Trade Bill could help scupper a Government defeat. :: Business groups welcome Corbyn's customs union pledge :: Everything you need to know about the customs union Mr Field suggested Mr Corbyn's announcement was worthy of ""a mound of beans"". He told Sky News: ""It's a brilliant speech, it's Blairism at its best. ""He's led you all up the garden path at the weekend and he's now set out demands that the whole country would vote for because he knows it's impossible to deliver,"" he said. ""If we could get this sort of agreement there would have been no referendum, no argy-bargy that's going on. But it' a brilliant piece of PR."" :: The real reason for Labour's Brexit shift He added: ""I think it's great news and Mr Blair at his peak could never have done a better spin than what Jeremy has done."" It came as Mr Corbyn denied he was undermining negotiations between Brussels and Downing Street, including by holding discussions with chief Brexit negotiator. He told Sky News: ""Michel Barnier is a very smart, very intelligent man and it would be a bit unwise of him not to be aware of the political circumstances surrounding the people he's negotiating with. ""On his last visit to Britain he met me, he met our team, he met many other people because he wanted to be aware of what the political process and atmosphere was of people in Britain."" :: May: The UK's 'best days lie ahead of us' Earlier, Labour's shadow international trade secretary said Labour could not be undermining Downing Street because ""the Government has no position to undermine"". But Tory Cabinet Office minister David Lidington hit back, saying he ""couldn't find a coherent theme"" to the vision in Mr Corbyn's speech. Mr Lidington made the comments as he delivered speech four of six of a Government PR blitz on Brexit. Monday's address was on devolution after Brexit and saw the PM's de facto deputy say leaving the EU was no excuse for ""breaking up the UK"". He also said powers repatriated after Brexit would go to Westminster over the devolved assemblies when the Government needed to protect the UK common market or a ""pause"" was needed to ""put a national framework in place""."

According to mountain rescue spokesman Francois Bepol, the group ventured off-piste and went in the wrong direction. They got into difficulty and took off their skis to try to climb upwards, Mr Bepol said. The cliff, however, was ""very steep and icy"" and two of the three men fell. The British man was found dead while the second man who fell was uninjured. The third man, who had not fallen, was not harmed. Mr Bepol could not confirm their ages. Alpe d'Huez is a ski resort at 1,250 to 3,330 metres (4,100ft-10,826ft) in the central French western Alps. The Foreign Office said: ""Following the death of a British national in the French Alps, we are providing consular support to the family. ""We remain in close contact with local authorities. ""Our thoughts are with the family at this difficult time."" Meanwhile, a 13-year-old boy has also died after falling from a cliff in the French Alps. The boy and his 10-year-old brother both fell from a 150m (492ft) cliff near Avoriaz ski resort, about 160 miles from Alpe d'Huez and near the Swiss border. The younger brother was taken to hospital but his condition is not life-threatening. The boys had been skiing alone on Saturday, while on holiday with their family."

During the night search and rescue teams found four bodies in the collapsed building and another body was found on Monday afternoon. Teams are continuing to carry out a rescue operation and believe more people may be trapped in the building, which was still on fire on Monday morning. Rescue work was temporarily suspended due to the structural integrity of a neighbouring building, with the search and rescue work due to resume later on Monday afternoon.

She described the building as ""a shop with flats on top of it"". Another local, Harrish Patni, said the ""big boom"" was felt six doors down while he was at a nearby pizza shop prompting him to call 999. He told Sky News: ""We heard this massive explosion, the shop window six doors away vibrated and we thought it can't be a car accident, it didn't sound like a crash. ""We came outside and there was a big cloud of smoke, bricks all across the road."" Another eyewitness, Tahir Khan, said the incident was ""like a Hollywood movie"". My thoughts are with the families of the four people who died and those injured in yesterday's explosion in Leicester. Thank you to the emergency services who are still on the scene and hospital staff who are working to save lives. At the scene, Sky News Correspondent Tom Parmenter said the damage to the main building had been ""very very significant"". He said the shop had been ""effectively demolished by the force of the explosion"". Local journalist Laura Scigliano told Sky News: ""I spoke to one lady who heard a massive bang. One man said he thought it sounded like a bomb. It looks like extensive damage... the building just looks like it has completely collapsed."" She described the road as one of the main routes into the city that was ""usually very busy during the day"". Leicestershire Police said: ""The cause of the explosion will be the subject of a joint investigation by the police and Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service. ""Electricity supply has been cut off for a number of properties in the Hinckley Road area while emergency services deal with the incident.""

The row stems from claims made by Mr Wolff in ""Fire And Fury: Inside the Trump White House"" that Mr Blair told Jared Kushner, Mr Trump's son-in-law and key adviser, that Britain might have spied on the Trump campaign and even Mr Trump himself. Mr Wolff also suggested that Mr Blair had been keen on a job as a Middle East peace envoy with Mr Trump's White House. The ex-premier denied the claims at the time of the book's publication earlier this year. But, asked about Mr Blair's denial on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Mr Wolff said: ""I sat in the White House on the couch listening - I wasn't supposed to overhear this but they were standing right there - with Tony Blair and Jared Kushner standing not 15 feet in front of me. ""With Tony Blair, let me choose my words carefully, sucking up to Jared Kushner."" He added: ""I have to say Tony Blair is a complete liar."" Mr Wolff's latest claims led Mr Blair to again repeat his insistence the claims are a ""complete fabrication"". A statement from the Tony Blair Institute said: ""Michael Wolff has never been present at any conversation between Jared Kushner and Mr Blair. ""He neither sought such a role from Jared Kushner nor was offered one. ""And we note that many people have had the same experience with Michael Wolff."" In a follow-up statement, published on Twitter, the Tony Blair Institute accused Mr Wolff of ""changing his version of events"" by now saying he ""overheard"" a conversation between Mr Blair and Mr Kushner. The statement pointed out how Mr Wolff had previously suggested he was not present or witnessed the supposed conversation, but insisted he was ""absolutely confident of my sources""."
2018-02-26,"Last month while being grilled by a committee of MPs, Brexit Secretary David Davis said anyone who went into a negotiation trumpeting their red lines was an ""idiot"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180226155417/https://news.sky.com/story/the-real-reason-for-labour-and-jeremy-corbyns-brexit-shift-on-a-customs-union-11267534,"Unfortunately for Mr Davis, that is precisely what his boss Theresa May has done. At the core of the Brexit vision set out a year ago in the Prime Minister's Lancaster House speech was the fact the UK was leaving the single market and the customs union. In the last few weeks, Mrs May restated that Lancaster House fact - kiboshing suggestions she was contemplating a post-Brexit customs union of any kind. It is a clear red line, and one of her own making. But there are growing questions about whether there is a majority in the House of Commons for it. Cross-party amendments to the Trade Bill have been tabled by some rebel MPs from Mrs May's own backbenches, which - if passed - would require the Government to enter into a customs union with the EU. Backing from the Liberal Democrats and the SNP for such proposals was always a given, but Labour's shift in stance to now support a customs union has upped the ante. Tory rebels like Anna Soubry and Ken Clarke have already inflicted one defeat on the Government over Brexit and, if they are able to garner similar numbers, they could do so again. But this time with far more significant repercussions. :: What you need to know about customs union The nervousness in Government is obvious. Senior figures are understood to be considering the brinkmanship of recasting a vote on the amendment as a vote of confidence in Mrs May's leadership. Little wonder then, that Labour now sense this is the moment to exploit that fear. As a political play, Jeremy Corbyn's expected announcement that Labour will back remaining in a customs union with the EU is motivated far more by the prospect of collapsing the Government and forcing a general election than anything to do with frictionless trade. It is not so much an evolution of policy as an escalation of Labour's efforts to bring Mrs May down. That is what shadow Brexit secretary Sir Kier Starmer means when he says ""crunch time"" is approaching for the Prime Minister. He is not talking about questions on policy specifics, he is talking about whether Mrs May can avoid defeat at the hands of rebels in her own party if Labour swing in behind them. The first defensive step taken by the Government has been to buy time by pushing discussion of the Trade Bill back by a few months, giving the Tory whips space to exert pressure on potential rebels to back down. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox urged those Tory rebels on Sunday to keep an ""open mind"" ahead of an upcoming speech on Brexit the Prime Minister will deliver in the North East on Friday. Dr Fox said he was confident that once pro-Remain Conservatives hear Mrs May set out the Brexit position agreed between senior Cabinet members at Chequers last week, many of their concerns would be put to rest. Yet, given even some of those present at the Chequers meeting are understood to have doubts about how resilient the delicately-balanced Cabinet agreement will be - once it's set out at the Brussels negotiating table - it seems unlikely Tory rebels will be reassured in any lasting sense. But, even if they were and they chose to withdraw the amendment, to some degree the damage is already done. They have already demonstrated enough disquiet to prompt Labour to shift its Brexit position in order to capitalise on the potential for a House of Commons majority that might defeat the Government. This is likely to be ongoing pressure point for the Prime Minister, and yet it is hard to see what Mrs May can do to reduce that pressure. The Prime Minister's commitment to leave the customs union is perhaps the clearest thing she has ever said on Brexit. It is the reddest of red lines and Mrs May's position is likely untenable if she reneges on it. And yet, given the parliamentary arithmetic, there are real questions over whether the Prime Minister can deliver on it. Mr Davis' musings to the select committee on the wisdom of setting red lines in negotiations was delivered in the abstract. But, in the context of the parliamentary battles ahead, it may have been unwittingly prescient."

Just half of their parents - the so-called baby boomers - were overweight or obese at the same age. Professor Linda Bauld, a cancer prevention expert at the charity, said despite millennials being known ""for following seemingly healthy food trends"", the research showed they needed to improve their eating habits. ""Nothing beats a balanced diet,"" she said. The charity warned that being overweight is the UK's biggest cause of cancer after smoking - and is linked to 13 different types of cancer including breast, bowel and kidney cancer. It said only 15% of Britons are aware of the link and has launched a campaign to raise awareness of it. The charity, which based its study on Health Survey for England data, is calling for a ban on junk food adverts before the 9pm watershed. Tam Fry, chairman of the National Obesity Forum, said the figures were ""horrifying"" and ""70% could well be an underestimate"". Public Health Minister Steve Brine added: ""These figures confirm what we know already - childhood obesity is an enormous health challenge, one that is putting young people at risk of dying from preventable illnesses later in life. ""That is why we are delivering the most ambitious childhood obesity plan in the world- taxing sugary drinks, helping children to exercise more, funding more research and cutting sugar and calories in food before it hits shelves and plates.

Up to 400 foreign nationals are held at Yarl's Wood - nearly all of them women - as they wait to find out if they will be deported. One of them, a 35-year-old from Algeria, arrived in the UK when she was just 11 years old. Twenty-four years later, when applying for a passport, she found out she was undocumented and told Sky News she has been held at Yarl's Wood for the last three months. ""My life is just in limbo, it's the uncertainty as well. You don't how long you'll be locked up, you don't when you're getting out, you don't know where you're going, I can't describe that feeling. ""I feel like I have been kidnapped basically, I don't know where I am going, I don't know what's going on."" She told Sky News many of those inside are victims of horrific crimes. ""The thing that touches my heart is that I met so many people from really messed up places and they go through things - corrective rape, I didn't even know such a thing existed, and they lock up trafficking victims and victims of forced labour."" She and other detainees are now starting what they call an ""all-out strike"" - refusing to eat, use facilities or work inside the centre. The group Detained Voices, which campaigns for those being held in UK immigration centres, says some detainees in Yarl's Wood want an end to indefinite detentions, better healthcare and an amnesty for those who have lived in the UK for 10 years or more. Following her visit last week, Ms Chakrabarti told Sky News many inside feel desperate and forgotten. ""We went in on a supervised visit - it's very difficult for us to get under skin as undercover journalists can - I think the media need to be allowed regular access to these women. They're not getting proper access to decent legal advice and that's a massive problem and the establishment probably needs to be shut down in due course."" The Home Office says it detains people at Yarl's Wood for the ""minimum time possible"" and not indefinitely. It added that last year 92% of people were detained for four months or less and that any decision to extend detention is made on a case-by-case basis. Commenting on the hunger strike, it said: ""Any detainees who choose to refuse food and fluid are closely monitored by on site healthcare professionals. If detainees choose not to eat meals provided by the immigration detention centre, they also have the option of buying food from the centre's shop."" Last year a report into Yarl's Wood found there had been ""significant"" improvements after warning the centre was ""failing to meet the needs of the most vulnerable women""."

Mr Enany said: ""It's only the beginning, we are very soon going to add a new archaeological attraction to Middle Egypt."" Mostafa Waziri, secretary general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, said: ""Evacuation work is scheduled to last for five years in an attempt to uncover all the burials in the cemetery."" Mr Waziri said that during the last three months the excavation team had discovered a group of tombs and burials that belong to priests of the ancient Egyptian god Thoth. The tomb also contains 13 burials, a thousand full statues and hundreds of other broken pieces. Four canopic jars made of alabaster with lids that have the faces of the four sons of the god Horus have also been unearthed. Mr Waziri said: ""They are in a very good state of conservation. They still contain the mummified inner organs of the deceased. The jars are decorated with hieroglyphic texts showing the name and titles of their owner."" Egypt's relics are a magnet to tourists and authorities hope new finds can help attract more as a way to boost tourism hit by the unrest following the ousting of former President Hosni Mubarak in 2011.

2018-02-26,"Labour wants ""a"" customs union but not ""the"" customs union while the Government doesn't want ""any form"" of customs union - but what does it all mean?",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180226155417/https://news.sky.com/story/what-you-need-to-know-about-customs-union-11267477,":: What is a customs union? A customs union is defined as a group of states that have agreed to eliminate customs duties (import taxes) on trade between themselves, as well as reduce other administrative requirements. It also sees those states impose a common external tariff on imports from non-members. :: What is the EU's customs union? The EU's customs union means all trade in goods between member states must be free of customs duties. All members must also impose the bloc's common external tariff on all goods arriving from outside the EU. This means once imported into the EU, goods can then move around the bloc without any further customs checks. :: So, will Britain be leaving the EU's customs union? Yes, most probably. Membership of the EU's customs union is written into the bloc's treaties, which will cease to apply to the UK in March 2019. Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer has stated the ""customs arrangements at the moment are hardwired into the membership treaty"". Although Monaco and the British territories of Akrotiri and Dhekelia, Guernsey, the Isle of Man and Jersey are not EU members, they are part of the EU's customs arrangements through their relationship with full member states. :: But, Britain could form a new customs union with the EU, right? Again, yes. Non-EU countries such as Turkey, Andorra and San Marino are each in a bilateral customs union with the EU. Labour now wants the UK to enter such a customs union with the EU after Brexit through a new treaty that will ""do the work of the current customs union"". However, the Government has ruled out any form of customs union with the EU once Britain leaves the bloc. :: The real reason for Labour's Brexit shift :: Does that stop the UK signing free trade deals with non-EU countries? This is debated among politicians and would likely depend on the nature of any customs union negotiated between the EU and the UK. As a current member of the EU's customs union, trade deals with non-EU countries are negotiated on the UK's behalf by Brussels. One of the main benefits of Brexit touted by Leave supporters is that it will allow Britain to regain control over its own trade policy and sign deals with countries such as the US, China and Australia. They say it will also allow the UK to reduce tariffs on imports, such as produce from the developing world, thereby boosting those countries' economies and meaning cheaper prices for British consumers. Brexiteers argue re-entering a new customs union with the EU after Brexit will hinder those ambitions. Even arch-Remainer Tony Blair has dismissed the prospect of Britain having an effective, independent trade policy if it remains in a customs union with the EU. He told Sky News: ""If you're in a comprehensive customs union, between the UK and the EU, you're not really going to be striking free trade deals with other countries. ""And, in so far as you are in any form of customs union, you are going make yourself much less attractive to those other countries to strike a trade deal."" But Labour says the UK would be ""more likely"" to sign new trade deals after Brexit by doing it ""jointly"" with the EU through a customs union with the bloc. :: But, can't Turkey sign its own trade deals? Remain-supporting Tory MP Nicky Morgan has insisted it is ""perfectly possible"" for Britain to remain in a customs union with the EU. She has cited Turkey's ability to sign its own trade agreements in sectors which are not covered by its customs union with the EU, such as agriculture. But critics say this is merely theoretical and, in practice, proves too complicated for Turkey to do. They also point to how Turkey has to open its markets to any new country the EU strikes a trade deal with, even though it doesn't have any say over how that agreement was negotiated. Turkey's customs union with the EU was also seen as the first step towards full EU membership for the country. :: And what does it all mean for Northern Ireland? It is argued that retaining a customs union with the EU after Brexit is the only way to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, an EU member state. This is something the UK Government, the Irish Government and the EU are all committed too. The UK Government has stated options such as customs exemptions for smaller traders, a ""trusted trader"" scheme for larger businesses and ""technology-based solutions"" could all be among answers to the Irish border dilemma."

Train operator C2C said journeys after 9pm on Monday could be altered or cancelled due to the icy conditions, while Great Northern said it would run a ""heavily reduced timetable"" on Tuesday. #BeastFromTheEast pic.twitter.com/vn4hUhkCMj Greater Anglia, which will stop running services at 10pm on Monday, apologised for the disruption, saying the last time such heavy snow fell in the region was more than 25 years ago. The Ministry of Defence said it had three battalions on standby to respond to weather-related emergencies. The Met Office is predicting up to 20cm (7in) of snow in some parts of eastern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland by the end of Wednesday. The wind chill in the UK, which could see parts of the country drop to temperatures as cold as -15C (23F), is on par with forecasts for parts of northern Norway and Iceland. Public Health England has urged people to check on elderly or vulnerable neighbours during the cold spell. Members of the public have also been asked to look out for the homeless and report anyone sleeping rough in the freezing conditions to their local council. Amber warnings of snow have been issued for northern, central and south-eastern England on Tuesday, and eastern Scotland on Wednesday.

The majority of Britain is being warned of the potential for delays on the roads, trains and in the air by the middle of the week. A less severe yellow warning for snow is in place from Monday to Wednesday. Sky News weather presenter Isobel Lang warned that snow showers would become ""heavier and more frequent"" this week. She said: ""Tonight will see a penetrating frost with snow showers becoming heavier especially across southeast England and the Thames Estuary along with southern Scotland and northern England. ""Tuesday and Wednesday will bring further showers, and some more persistent snow belts which will pushouthwestwards across the country through the day."

The 28-year-old was the driver of an Audi which hit Harry Louis Rice, 17, and 16-year-olds George Toby Wilkinson and Josh McGuinness as they waited at a bus stop in Hayes on 26 January. They were heading to a 16th birthday party at the Goals five-a-side football club at about 8.40pm with a group of friends when they were hit. Chudasama mounted the pavement and was arrested shortly after at the scene. The black car was seen with its bonnet crumpled and its front left wheel hanging off. Another man, aged 34, was arrested two days after the crash after he voluntarily attended a north London police station. Despite the efforts of paramedics, all three boys were pronounced dead at the scene. Tash Moriarty, headteacher at the boys' school, Harefield Academy, said at the time: ""We are all shocked and deeply saddened by the tragic loss of three students who attended the Harefield Academy. ""Our thoughts and condolences are with their families, friends and loved ones at this terrible time. ""We are offering help and support to all students and staff who have been affected by this incident, and ask everyone to respect their privacy at this difficult time."""
2018-02-27,"""Cryptojacking"" attacks in the UK have surged by 1,200% in just a few months, cybersecurity researchers have told Sky News.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180227163245/https://news.sky.com/story/cryptojacking-attacks-surge-1200-in-uk-11269594,"The figures, which show the huge increase from October to January, were detected by cybersecurity firm Symantec Threat Intelligence and rank the UK fourth in the world in terms of the numbers of victims. Cryptojacking involves an attacker using their victim's computer to mine cryptocurrencies, often doing so within web browsers such as Chrome. Victims do not lose their own finances to cryptojacking, experts say, but do end up with unwanted software running on their computers. Of more than five million attacks globally, only in the United States, Japan and France were more incidents detected. Germany rounded off the top five. It means the UK is now home to 4% of all cryptojacking victims in the world. Earlier in February, an attack hit people visiting the websites of the Information Commissioner's Office and the Student Loans Company after hackers inserted a mining script into a browser plug-in designed to help the partially sighted. Symantec security researcher Candid Wueest said attacks are likely to increase even further over the next six months. However, he said the damage to victims could be worse. ""The in-browser cryptocurrency miners are not installing anything on the victim's machines, they're not encrypting files,"" Mr Wueest told Sky News. ""Even though they could potentially steal credentials, at the moment the attackers don't want to."" Instead, the miners are attempting to be unobtrusive and secretive to avoid detection because ""they want to be able to continue mining for as long as possible"" Mr Wueest said. Curiously, it is the same buoyed value of cryptocurrencies driving criminals to target others' machines that is also protecting those machines from more malicious interference. Alex Davies, security consultant at Countercept, told Sky News that while users are not losing their own finances, the unwanted software can cause significant problems. ""That software could do anything,"" he said. ""Sure, right now it's cryptomining software, but maybe the malware author pushes an update and suddenly it's now banking malware and it steals your online banking credentials. ""That's the kind of situation we're in. You never want to have unknown software running on your computer."" There are now more than 1,300 cryptocurrencies in existence, with the market capitalisation of the largest, bitcoin, worth approximately $181bn as of publication. However, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency called monero, with a market cap of only $5bn, is more commonly mined by cryptojackers - and not just because of the increased anonymity it provides its users. Unlike bitcoin mining - which is dependent upon specialised hardware - the monero mining algorithm is designed so it can be effectively run on consumer devices, and even in a web browser. This has even led to monero being considered as a legitimate revenue source by online magazine Salon, which plans to offer consenting readers an advertisement-free experience in exchange for their processing power. Monero's privacy features also make it attractive to those who want to conceal their transactions. Bitcoin is only somewhat anonymous, Mr Wueest explained. ""You might not know who is paying who, but you can see where the money goes,"" he said, referencing bitcoin's traceable and transparent blockchain. The monero blockchain however conceals the transactions between different addresses using cryptographic ring signatures."
2018-02-27,"Women face ""unacceptable differences"" in breast cancer care across England caused by variations in screening, the availability of drugs and a staffing crisis, a new report has concluded.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180227163245/https://news.sky.com/story/breast-cancer-care-inequality-doubles-the-risk-for-some-women-11269341,"The All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Breast Cancer found ""stark"" variations in the standard and availability of care across England, sometimes within the same town or region. Marked differences in the volume and effectiveness of screening means that some women are far more likely to have their cancer diagnosed early. In areas with complete diagnosis records for at least nine out of 10 women, Rushcliffe covering Nottingham was the best-performing area with 88% of breast cancers identified at stage 1 or 2. Gloucestershire on the other hand was the worst performing with just 62%. In Slough, just 32% of breast cancers were identified at stage 1 or 2, but the area only has complete records of the diagnosis path of 40% of cases so was not highlighted by the report. In some areas only just over half of women take up invitations for screening compared with four in five women in other parts of the country. In addition, life-saving drugs are not offered evenly across the country, and some women receive the care of specialist nurses unavailable elsewhere. Workforce shortages are also a significant factor, with 13% of all radiology posts currently vacant, and one in five radiographers due to retire within the next five years. The result, the report found, is that some women are more than twice as likely to die from breast cancer under the age of 75 based on where they live. In a joint statement, MPs Thangam Debonnaire, Craig Tracey and Dr Philippa Whitford, who co-chair the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Breast Cancer, said: ""Our inquiry has uncovered a concerning postcode lottery in screening uptake, early diagnosis and access to breast cancer services across England. ""This variation in NHS services can have a devastating impact on patients' lives and must be addressed. ""In particular, the demographic time bomb facing the breast cancer workforce poses a worrying threat to the significant progress made in recent decades. ""We now urgently need to bring the worst performing areas in line with the best. While such inequalities exist, we cannot hope to meet the Government's ambition of world-class outcomes for all NHS cancer patients."" Baroness Delyth Morgan, chief executive at the charity Breast Cancer Now, added: ""All women with breast cancer deserve the best possible chance of surviving and living well, no matter where they live, their age or the colour of their skin. ""This alarming report shows many women are missing out on the best breast cancer care this country has to offer, and this is totally unacceptable."" Public Health Minister Steve Brine said: ""We have made huge progress on tackling cancer with survival rates at a record high. ""Our NHS breast screening programme is estimated to save 1,300 lives a year alone, but we know we need to go further. That’s why we’ve committed £200m to find innovative ways to drive earlier diagnosis and support people living with and beyond cancer so we can reach our goal of saving a further 30,000 lives a year by 2020."""

The number of people diagnosed with the condition across the UK has reached almost 3.7 million - an increase of 1.9 million since 1998. A further 12.3 million people are at an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes, according to the charity's analysis. Meanwhile, the number of people diagnosed with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes has increased by almost 100,000 since last year - from 3,590,501 to 3,689,509. The charity found Bradford has the UK's highest prevalence of diabetes, with one in 10 people (10.4%) in the West Yorkshire city being diagnosed with the condition. The lowest is in Richmond, west London, where just 3.6% of people are living with a diagnosis. The national average is 6.6%. Diabetes UK also estimates that there are nearly one million diabetic people who don't know it. Almost nine in ten cases of diabetes are Type 2, which is linked to lifestyle factors such as obesity. ""Diabetes is the fastest growing health crisis of our time; and the fact that diagnoses have doubled in just 20 years should give all of us serious pause for thought,"" says Diabetes UK chief executive Chris Askew. ""Both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes are serious conditions that can lead to devastating complications such as amputation, blindness, kidney disease, stroke and heart disease if people don't receive a timely diagnosis and begin receiving the right care."" The charity is calling on the Government to "" recognise the seriousness"" of the problem and introduce stricter restrictions on junk food advertising to children and supermarket price promotions for unhealthy foods."

CCTV of the lead-up to the September 2016 tragedy - at Ellough Park Raceway near Beccles, Suffolk - has been shown at the hearing. Mr Fairweather's son, Jason, crossed the line first and the marshal started to wave the chequered flag as other drivers also finished the race. Mr Fairweather appeared to slow to a stop just before he reached the line at the 1,070m outdoor track. Daughter-in-law Peggy Fairweather was seen going around the final bend and overtaking another driver, Adam Rouse, on the finish straight before crashing into the back of Mr Fairweather. Tony Burgess, environmental health officer for Waveney District Council, said: ""Peggy glanced to her left where there was another driver, Adam Rouse, who she was in the process of overtaking."" He said the time between her glancing to her left and the impact was just two seconds. Describing the moment before the crash, Mr Burgess said: ""Just at the last moment her head moves back to the forward-looking position."" Mr Fairweather's brother Andrew, who was ahead of him, had earlier slowed to a brief stop at the finish line. The marshal was seen pointing towards the pit lane before Andrew Fairweather gave him the thumbs up and drove on. The inquest heard it was possible that victim Allan Fairweather, of Oulton Broad near Lowestoft, Suffolk, saw this."

He insisted it was a ""very relevant comparison"". ""There's no border between Camden and Westminster,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""But when I was mayor of London we anaesthetically and invisibly took hundreds of millions of pounds from the accounts of people travelling between those two boroughs without any need for border checks, whatever."" Challenged on the comparison, Mr Johnson said: ""It's a very relevant comparison because there's all sorts of scope for pre-booking, electronic checks, all sorts of things that you can do to obviate the need for a hard border."" His comments sparked criticism and mockery from other MPs. :: Why does Johnson keep ignoring Irish border? Labour's David Lammy said the intervention ""isn't just stupidity and ignorance but wilful recklessness"". He added in a jibe at the comparison: ""When I was a young boy we were told to stay away from the Troubles on the Caledonian Road and marching bands in Regent's Park. ""The Chalk Farm Peace Agreement has brought peace in our time. People can get the tube from Camden Town to Finsbury Park without being searched at the border."" Shadow Northern Ireland secretary Owen Smith called the Foreign Secretary's comments ""typically facile and thoughtless"". And Chris Leslie, a Labour backbencher and supporter of the pro-EU Open Britain campaign, said: ""Now we know why Boris Johnson didn't mention the problem of the Irish border once in his big Brexit speech last week: because he simply doesn't understand it. ""Boris Johnson's tenure as Foreign Secretary and Brexit cheerleader shows he has the reverse Midas touch: everything he touches turns to muck."" It came amid a damning intervention by the former permanent secretary at the Department for International Trade. Martin Donnelly, who resigned last year, compared quitting the single market and customs union to ""rejecting a three course meal now in favour of the promise of a packet of crisps later"". ""There is a marked lack of evidence that leaving the EU customs union and single market will lead to greater UK trade with third countries,"" a leaked copy of a speech he is due to give on Wednesday said."
2018-02-27,A coroner has ruled it was unacceptable that a five-year-old girl died after she was turned away from an emergency doctors for being minutes late.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180227163245/https://news.sky.com/story/girl-5-died-after-doctor-turned-her-away-for-being-10-minutes-late-11269249,"Ellie-May Clark had been booked for an emergency appointment because she was having breathing difficulties but arrived five minutes late, an inquest heard. Newport Coroner's Court heard her mother, who had an eight-week-old baby and did not have a car, was given just 25 minutes to get Ellie-May to the Grange Clinic in Newport, South Wales, but got stuck in a queue at the surgery. The inquest was told that the doctor refused to see patients who were more than 10 minutes late. Doctors at the surgery had been warned by a consultant that the girl was at risk of a ""severe/life-threatening"" asthma episode. But the youngster was turned away and went home to bed, where she collapsed about five hours later and died in hospital. Her death - on 26 January 2015 - was caused by bronchial asthma. Wendy James, senior coroner for Gwent, said it was ""not acceptable"" that Ellie-May had been turned away without any assessment or advice on what to do if her condition worsened. Recording a narrative verdict, she said: ""From the evidence before me, it is not possible for me to determine with certainty whether an earlier intervention would have altered the outcome for Ellie, but nonetheless Ellie should have been seen by a GP that day and she was let down by the failures in the system."" The court heard Ellie-May's school had phoned her mother, Shanice Clark, to tell her she was not well and recommended she see a doctor. Miss Clark phoned the Grange Clinic at 3.30pm reporting that her daughter was wheezing and could not walk but the surgery did not phone back until 4.35pm, when she was offered a 5pm appointment. Ellie-May and her mother arrived at 5.05pm and then had to wait for a receptionist to finish a phone call and deal with a patient in front of them in the queue. They spoke to receptionist Ann Jones between 5.10pm and 5.18pm. Mrs Jones phoned Dr Joanne Rowe to tell her Ellie-May had arrived but ""Dr Rowe replied that she wouldn't see Ellie as she was late and she would need to come back the following day,"" the coroner said. Neither the receptionist nor Dr Rowe asked why Ellie-May was late or the reason for her emergency appointment. The doctor did not open Ellie-May's medical file or ask if a colleague could see her. Miss Clark said Ellie-May was upset after leaving the surgery, asking her mother: ""Why won't the doctor see me?"" She told the inquest she thought at the time her daughter did not need to go to hospital, adding: ""Obviously now I would do things differently."" Ellie-May went to bed at about 8pm and Miss Clark checked on her daughter every 10-15 minutes. At 10.30pm, after hearing her coughing, she checked again and saw that Ellie-May's face and hands had turned blue. The girl was taken to the Royal Gwent Hospital, where she was pronounced dead a short time later. The coroner said she would write to the surgery, the Aneurin Bevan health board, the health inspectorate of Wales, the chief coroner and Miss Clark to try to prevent future deaths. A statement from Dr Rowe was read at the inquest, saying: ""Dr Rowe knows that nothing can be said to Ellie-May's family to make a difference but she would like to say how truly sorry she is."" Justin Chisnall, of Harding Evans Solicitors, read a statement from Ellie-May's family saying they were ""disappointed"" the coroner did not deliver a verdict of neglect. He said: ""The family acknowledge the apology from Dr Rowe, especially as they have been waiting in excess of three years for an outcome and to receive answers to their questions."""

Forecasters predict up to 15cm (6in) of snow could fall in just a few hours with the warnings in place between 2am and 12pm. Drivers, commuters and those looking to catch planes are being warned they could face even more severe disruption on Tuesday morning as the freezing temperatures continue into the week. An amber warning is also in place for the northeast of England and Scotland between 6am on Wednesday and 12pm on Thursday, with up to 40cm (16in) of snow expected to fall during that period. There could be blizzards, gales and sleet on Thursday as Storm Emma hits the cold air already over the UK. The wind chill, which could see parts of the country drop as low as -15C (23F), is on par with forecasts for parts of northern Norway and Iceland. A less severe yellow warning is in place until Friday across many other areas of the UK. Hundreds of trains and dozens of flights have already been cancelled as a result of the harsh conditions. Met Office forecaster Marco Petagna said people should ""try to avoid"" travelling where and when the amber warnings apply. Schools could also be hit by closures due to heavy snowfall this week. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), said: ""Schools should stay open if they possibly can but safety concerns are the most important. ""If it's not safe for the school to be open then it is fine to close."" The Met Office said rural communities could be cut off, with power outages and disruption to mobile phone services likely. More than 200 Greater Anglia trains are no longer running on Monday and Tuesday, while South Eastern passengers were told to finish journeys by 6pm on Monday to avoid disruption. Passengers were also warned to expected delays and cancellations on c2c, London Overground, South Western Railway, Southeastern, Stansted Express and TfL Rail. Train operator Great Northern said it would run a ""heavily reduced timetable"" on Tuesday. British Airways said it had cancelled over 68 short-haul flights. Public Health England has urged people to check on elderly or vulnerable neighbours during the cold spell. Members of the public have also been asked to look out for the homeless and report anyone sleeping rough in the freezing conditions to their local council. Sky News weather forecaster Chris England said the snowfalls are set to become more severe this week. He said: ""Snow showers will continue over many eastern areas tonight, turning heavy in places, with some getting across to northwest England later. ""Parts of eastern England in particular can expect around 15cm (6in) of snow, leading to some disruption. It will be freezing everywhere.

The west of Ireland will be mostly fine. ""Britain will be near freezing all day, with a bitterly cold wind. Wednesday will bring widespread snow showers, some heavy. It will be very cold, with many places not getting above freezing all day. ""Thursday will bring further heavy snow showers and the risk of more general snow in the South."""

2018-02-27,"Last month while being grilled by a committee of MPs, Brexit Secretary David Davis said anyone who went into a negotiation trumpeting their red lines was an ""idiot"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180227163245/https://news.sky.com/story/the-real-reason-for-labour-and-jeremy-corbyns-brexit-shift-on-a-customs-union-11267534,"Unfortunately for Mr Davis, that is precisely what his boss Theresa May has done. At the core of the Brexit vision set out a year ago in the Prime Minister's Lancaster House speech was the fact the UK was leaving the single market and the customs union. In the last few weeks, Mrs May restated that Lancaster House fact - kiboshing suggestions she was contemplating a post-Brexit customs union of any kind. It is a clear red line, and one of her own making. But there are growing questions about whether there is a majority in the House of Commons for it. Cross-party amendments to the Trade Bill have been tabled by some rebel MPs from Mrs May's own backbenches, which - if passed - would require the Government to enter into a customs union with the EU. Backing from the Liberal Democrats and the SNP for such proposals was always a given, but Labour's shift in stance to now support a customs union has upped the ante. Tory rebels like Anna Soubry and Ken Clarke have already inflicted one defeat on the Government over Brexit and, if they are able to garner similar numbers, they could do so again. But this time with far more significant repercussions. :: What you need to know about customs union The nervousness in Government is obvious. Senior figures are understood to be considering the brinkmanship of recasting a vote on the amendment as a vote of confidence in Mrs May's leadership. Little wonder then, that Labour now sense this is the moment to exploit that fear. As a political play, Jeremy Corbyn's expected announcement that Labour will back remaining in a customs union with the EU is motivated far more by the prospect of collapsing the Government and forcing a general election than anything to do with frictionless trade. It is not so much an evolution of policy as an escalation of Labour's efforts to bring Mrs May down. That is what shadow Brexit secretary Sir Kier Starmer means when he says ""crunch time"" is approaching for the Prime Minister. He is not talking about questions on policy specifics, he is talking about whether Mrs May can avoid defeat at the hands of rebels in her own party if Labour swing in behind them. The first defensive step taken by the Government has been to buy time by pushing discussion of the Trade Bill back by a few months, giving the Tory whips space to exert pressure on potential rebels to back down. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox urged those Tory rebels on Sunday to keep an ""open mind"" ahead of an upcoming speech on Brexit the Prime Minister will deliver in the North East on Friday. Dr Fox said he was confident that once pro-Remain Conservatives hear Mrs May set out the Brexit position agreed between senior Cabinet members at Chequers last week, many of their concerns would be put to rest. Yet, given even some of those present at the Chequers meeting are understood to have doubts about how resilient the delicately-balanced Cabinet agreement will be - once it's set out at the Brussels negotiating table - it seems unlikely Tory rebels will be reassured in any lasting sense. But, even if they were and they chose to withdraw the amendment, to some degree the damage is already done. They have already demonstrated enough disquiet to prompt Labour to shift its Brexit position in order to capitalise on the potential for a House of Commons majority that might defeat the Government. This is likely to be ongoing pressure point for the Prime Minister, and yet it is hard to see what Mrs May can do to reduce that pressure. The Prime Minister's commitment to leave the customs union is perhaps the clearest thing she has ever said on Brexit. It is the reddest of red lines and Mrs May's position is likely untenable if she reneges on it. And yet, given the parliamentary arithmetic, there are real questions over whether the Prime Minister can deliver on it. Mr Davis' musings to the select committee on the wisdom of setting red lines in negotiations was delivered in the abstract. But, in the context of the parliamentary battles ahead, it may have been unwittingly prescient."

Leah Beth Reek, 18, who was Shane's girlfriend, and Viktorija Ljevleva, 22, are also missing. Ms Ljevleva is thought to have been working in the supermarket at the time. Leicestershire Police said search and rescue teams found five bodies in the wreckage but they were so badly injured ""it may be some considerable time before the bodies can be formally identified"". Another five people were taken to hospital on Sunday night following the blast in Hinckley Road. One of them remains in hospital with ""life-threatening"" injuries and police and fire crews have concluded that there are no survivors remaining among the wreckage. Superintendent Shane O'Neill said: ""We made sure by using specialist dogs and equipment to make sure there is no other sign that anyone else is still alive in the premises. ""Tragically, all we are now looking for is any further human remains. This is vital work that is being done, on behalf of the victims and their families, and it will take some time to complete."" Fire crews used specialist listening equipment, cameras and motion sensors to search the rubble. Shocking footage of the explosion was captured on CCTV, showing debris being blasted across the road to the opposite pavement. Witness Ady Wells, 23, was driving home with his girlfriend Ruby-May Dexter when the explosion occurred. ""I lost control of the wheel because the explosion was so strong, but I was able to swerve left and park up on the side road,"" he said. ""There was a dense black smoke everywhere for about two or three minutes. It's only after that lifted that the fire actually started. I ran over and picked up a plank from the rubble and saw a man lying there beneath it. It was very traumatic."" The building was still on fire on Monday morning. Police said the five supposed victims' relatives have been informed and ""are being supported by specially-trained officers at this desperate time"", a police statement said. Teams remain at the scene as part of the investigation into why the building exploded then set on fire. Their work is being hindered by adverse weather conditions as a Siberian cold front spreads across the UK, with heavy snow forecast for later on Tuesday. The A47 will remain closed in both directions as they carry out the investigation. Search teams have faced continuous difficulties at the site, having to suspend work periodically due to concerns over the structural integrity of neighbouring buildings."

MPs said her revelations threw up serious questions, not least for Carillion's auditors, KPMG. Minutes of board meetings described Ms Mercer as ""whistleblowing"", the MPs said. Ms Mercer's concerns led to a review of contracts, although the board's initial decision to have an independent element was later reconsidered. Frank Field, who chairs the Work and Pensions Committee, said: ""Emma Mercer took just six weeks to spot and pull the thread that began the entire company unravelling. ""That the next Chief Financial Officer had to go through whistle blowing procedures to get her concerns about accounting irregularities taken seriously by the Carillion board is extraordinary. :: MPs target ex-Carillion CFO Richard Adam over £776,000 share 'dump' ""So too is that the board's response was to reject an independent review and get KPMG, their pet rubber-stampers, to mark their own homework. ""While our witnesses have been reticent in oral testimony, these minutes begin to reveal the true picture of a company falling apart at the seams in full view of the board and their auditors."" Rachel Reeves, chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Select Committee, said: ""Carillion directors say they couldn't foresee what investors and company staff could - that spiralling debt problems and failing contracts were destined to sink the company. ""These board minutes point to a very different scenario - Emma Mercer was sounding the alarm but none of the Carillion directors were willing to wake up and listen."" The collapse of Carillion has so far led to 1,371 job losses since the company went into liquidation last month. The committees have launched a joint inquiry into its collapse and the company's former executives will be questioned by the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee on Tuesday."

The prank backfired, trapping the boy inside before he was later rescued. The video was posted on the ministry's social order offences account on Weibo, China's popular Twitter-like service, under the headline ""Stop being naughty!"" The footage, which has been viewed more than 12m times, shows the lift's control panel fusing, its lights turning on and off and its doors opening and closing, leaving the unidentified boy visibly distressed. He is seen frantically pressing the buttons to try to get out. In a post, the Ministry of Public Security said: ""The child was trapped before being rescued. Please educate and take good care of your children!"" Weibo users were quick to criticise the child's parents, with one popular comment saying: ""Behind a naughty child there are definitely naughty parents."" Another said: ""No family education; I especially detest these sort of children."" One user called for the child's family to foot the bill, commenting: ""Don't forget to charge his parents for the repair cost."" The ministry did not say if any action had been taken against the boy or his parents."
2018-02-27,"The terrorist threat from extreme right-wing groups and individuals has grown significantly, with four right-wing plots foiled in the past year, according to the UK's most senior counter-terror police officer.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180227163245/https://news.sky.com/story/four-far-right-terror-plots-foiled-in-the-last-year-as-threat-rises-11269058,"Scotland Yard assistant commissioner Mark Rowley, who retires in a fortnight's time, said neo-Nazi and far-right plots were becoming more organised and a matter of ""real concern"". The figures are not routinely disclosed but Mr Rowley said it was important to make them public in order to ""illustrate the growth of right-wing terrorism"". The assistant commissioner said: ""The right-wing terrorist threat is more significant and more challenging than perhaps the public debate gives it credit for."" Pointing to a shift in the nature of the threat, he added: ""Right-wing terrorism wasn't previously organised here."" He declined to give details of the four cases for legal reasons but said they ""reflect a combination of the organised and the individual"". In a briefing to the media at Scotland Yard, followed by a lecture at the Policy Exchange think tank in central London, Mr Rowley said that Islamist related terrorism remains the most significant threat facing the UK. As well as five attacks that hit Britain last year, police and MI5 intervened to disrupt an unprecedented number of suspected plots. Ten conspiracies of an Islamist nature have been stopped since the Westminster attack in March last year, Mr Rowley said. He warned the overall terror threat is ""considerable"" with more than 600 investigations encompassing Islamist, extreme right-wing and other motivations at any one time. The probes are focusing on more than 3,000 subjects of interest, while security agencies must also keep at least 20,000 individuals who have previously featured in inquiries under review. In his speech, he said: ""A deeply concerning characteristic is how both far-right and also Islamist terrorism are growing, allowing each side to reaffirm their grievances and justify their actions."" His remarks underline the authorities' mounting concern over the far-right threat, which was laid bare in the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox in June 2016 and the Finsbury Park attack a year later. In December 2016, National Action - which Mr Rowley described as a ""homegrown, white supremacist, neo-Nazi terrorist organisation"" - became the first extreme right-wing group to be banned under terrorism laws. MI5 has been given an increased role in the response to domestic extremism, including far-right threats, which police have historically led on. In a wide-ranging assessment of extremism and terrorism in Britain, Mr Rowley revealed that since the start of the conflict in Syria around 100 children have been safeguarded through the family courts. He said: ""The family courts and social services now routinely wrestle with child protection and safeguarding cases arising out of terrorism and extremism. ""However, we still see cases where parents convicted of terrorist-related offences, including radicalisers, retain care of their own children. ""I wonder if we need more parity between protecting children from paedophile and terrorist parents."" Mr Rowley, who has led UK counter-terrorism policing for nearly four years, described the existing threat as acute, and called for a ""whole society response"". As he prepares to leave his post, assistant commissioner Rowley said the tempo of terrorist activity was likely to remain extremely high for at least the next couple of years."
2018-02-27,"If scriptwriters at Universal Studios, Disney or Twentieth Century Fox were to come up with a storyline of the kind engulfing each of their parent companies just now, it would be dismissed as too far-fetched.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180227163245/https://news.sky.com/story/how-a-cabbie-convinced-comcasts-boss-to-reach-for-the-sky-11269684,"The parents of the trio - Comcast, Walt Disney Co and 21st Century Fox - find themselves embroiled in a multi-billion dollar tangle at the centre of which sits Sky plc, the owner of Sky News. In December 2016, Fox said it wanted to buy the remaining 61% of Sky that it does not already own. That deal has been snarled in the UK regulatory process with Matt Hancock, the Culture Secretary, due to rule by June on whether it should be allowed to go ahead. :: Comcast challenges Fox with £22.1bn Sky bid interest Assuming it does, Sky would be taken over by Fox, before being sold on to Disney as part of a wider deal involving all of Fox's entertainment assets. At the time, Comcast, America's biggest cable operator, also expressed an interest in buying those assets from Fox. It was even thought to be prepared to pay more than Disney. But Rupert Murdoch, the executive co-chairman of Fox, calculated that Comcast would have a tougher time getting a deal past US competition regulators than Disney - and Comcast walked away. Another factor was that, with Mr Murdoch's family receiving shares as part-consideration, Disney shares were more attractive in view of Comcast's shareholder structure - which effectively gives the Roberts family, which founded the company, control of it. Since then, two things have happened. The first is that Comcast's board has, according to reports, given serious consideration to reviving its interest in Fox's entertainment assets. The second is that, in the recent round of auctions for live TV rights for the Premier League, Sky emerged with a great result. In the next three year cycle, from 2019-22, it will be paying £200m less per season than in the current 2016-19 cycle. That has prompted some minority shareholders in Sky to argue that Fox needed to sweeten its terms from the 1075p-per-share it agreed to pay back in December 2016. They include Crispin Odey, one of the City's best-known fund managers and Elliott, a notoriously aggressive US hedge fund. Enter Comcast. The US giant has today waded in with a 1250p-a-share offer that values the whole of Sky at £22.1bn - compared with the £18.5bn Fox was prepared to pay. It has said that, while it would like to own all of the shares in Sky, it will be satisfied with 50% plus one share and that its takeover is not dependent on Fox selling its existing 39.1% stake in Sky. Crucially, it is promising to increase Sky's investment in UK TV and film production, as well as pledging to continue broadcasting news under the Sky brand - a guarantee Fox, too, has made along with promises to maintain the independence of Sky News. Comcast's intervention raises a number of questions for investors. The first is how Fox will respond. Sky's share price has shot up by more than a fifth, to 1330p, implying that investors expect Fox to come back with a higher offer. But Mr Murdoch might yet decide to alter the terms of his existing deal with Disney to exclude Sky from the sale. The second is Comcast's motivation. Is it simply interested in Sky, as it says, as a platform to grow its business in Europe? Or is this part of an attempt to get Fox back around the negotiating table in order to try and gazump Disney? A third question is how Disney itself reacts. It might choose to launch a takeover bid of its own for Sky which it, too, covets as a way of reducing its dependence on the US. Both Disney and Comcast have different reasons for wanting to do these deals. In the case of Disney, it wishes not only to widen its geographic spread, but also to acquire - with Fox's entertainment assets - a greater array of film and TV assets with which to take on internet giants like Netflix and Amazon Prime. In the case of Comcast, it too wishes to diversify away from the US, where cable subscribers have been ""cord-cutting"" in their droves. In response it has launched its own ""over-the-top"" streaming service, just as Disney and Fox have with Hulu, to try and get around this - but that service requires content. Hence the interest in both Sky and in Fox's entertainment assets. One fascinating dimension to this story - again, back to the Hollywood analogy - is the cast of characters it brings together. Mr Murdoch built Fox into one of the world's biggest entertainment companies, founding Sky along the way, but also owns - via News Corporation - some of the world's most famous newspaper titles, including The Sun, The Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Australian and the New York Post. It all started from a single newspaper in Adelaide and several members of Mr Murdoch's family have gone on to be executives either at Fox, Sky or News Corp. Comcast, too, is very much a family concern. Now the world's biggest broadcasting and cable television company, following its 2011 takeover of NBC Universal and its 2016 acquisition of Dreamworks Animation, it was built by Ralph Roberts from a single cable company in Tupelo, Mississippi. His son Brian is now chairman and chief executive of Comcast and the Roberts family exerts control of the business. And there is history, too, between Mr Roberts and Bob Iger, the Disney chief executive. Comcast sought to buy Disney in 2004 for $54bn. Disney rejected the offer and Comcast walked away. Mr Iger, who has called Sky a ""crown jewel"", scuppered Mr Roberts's ambitions on that occasion. It would be ironic were Mr Roberts to now do the same to him. The final characters, were this being turned into a film, would be the ordinary members of the public. Mr Roberts told reporters this morning that, during a recent visit to London, a taxi driver had spoken to him favourably and in detail about Sky in comparison with rival cable service Virgin Media. He was then impressed by a demonstration of the Sky Q service in a shopping mall by a Sky sales rep. Those two events, apparently, helped convince him to bid."

But she has decided not to join her husband as he goes to the Great Barrier Reef, Cairns, Gove and Darwin, along with the Pacific island of Vanuatu. Instead she will fly back to the UK on 6 April, leaving Prince Charles to return on the 10th. A spokeswoman for the Duchess said: ""The Duchess has always wanted to go to the Commonwealth Games but she was taking a little longer to decide what the rest of the programme was going to be and what the rest of her programme this year was going to be. ""We have got CHOGM (the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in London), the Prince of Wales' birthday, their Spring tour…so she is going to return after the Commonwealth Games as that would be the natural point to return home."" Asked whether this could be seen as a snub to Australia, the spokeswoman said: ""No. It's quite a gruelling tour, with some fantastic places for the Prince to visit. ""Her last tour there was in 2013. She is going to the Games, which she regards as a very important part of it."" When asked further if only going for two days looked odd, she added: ""Better than not. She decided a few weeks ago to firm up her plans. We were always looking at the Duchess coming."" It was also confirmed there were no health reasons, with the official saying she was ""as fit as a flea. The Duchess does not like flying but I think she sometimes has to embrace that fear and get on with it"". Palace officials emphasised the importance of this tour for celebrating ties with the Commonwealth especially in Australia where the Queen is head of state. They also confirmed that when the couple arrive at Old Government House in Brisbane, Prince Charles will receive a full ceremonial arrival, usually only laid on for visiting heads of state, because he will be representing his mother the Queen. The visit comes just weeks before heads of government from the 53 Commonwealth members will attend CHOGM from 16 April. The Queen is head of the Commonwealth but Prince Charles will not automatically inherit the title when he becomes king. As part of the tour, the Prince will meet the family of Australian wildlife expert Steve Irwin to highlight the plight of the world's coral reefs. Irwin, who was nicknamed the Crocodile Hunter, died in 2006 after being attacked by a stingray while filming footage for a documentary. The Prince of Wales will also visit the Pacific island of Vanuatu - where some islanders worship his father the Duke of Edinburgh as a god."

He rejected the claim from ex-permanent secretary Sir Martin Donnelly, saying: ""It's unsurprising that those that spent a lifetime within the EU would see moving away from it as being threatening. ""The particular choice that I heard Martin Donnelly outline I don't believe that is the choice that we face."" The comments came in a speech to British businesses at Bloomberg in central London, forming part of a mini-series by ministers meant to recapture the momentum of Brexit. Dr Fox went on the offensive against Labour, after Britain's biggest business group - the CBI - backed Jeremy Corbyn's call to remain in a customs union with the EU after Brexit. ""There doesn't seem to be much thought given to what would be imposed on the UK if we didn't want it,"" Dr Fox said. :: Brexit means what?!

And Dr Fox claimed 90% of global growth in the next 10-15 years will be outside Europe. Remaining inside the tariff-free EU trade zone ""would limit our ability to reach new trade agreements with the world's fastest-growing economies"", he said. In response, Labour's shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner said Dr Fox was ""divorced from reality and isolated from British businesses and workers"". The comments came as EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier claimed there ""has not been any progress"" on unresolved issues from the phase one deal - known as the Withdrawal Agreement. He said an open-ended transition was ""not possible"" and agreed with EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker the UK's trade position was an ""illusion"". Mr Barnier also dealt a blow to Boris Johnson, who compared the Northern Ireland border to the boundary between two London boroughs. Asked about the Foreign Secretary's comment, he said: ""For me what counts here is what the British Prime Minister says."""
2018-02-27,"Train operators make millions of pounds each year from delays caused by unplanned service disruption, which includes bad weather.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180227163245/https://news.sky.com/story/rail-firms-pocket-180m-from-delays-in-last-year-11269629,"Network Rail, which owns, operates and develops Britain's railways, compensates train operators when there are delays caused by circumstances which fall under Schedule 8 of the Office of Rail and Road's regulations. This means train operators receive money when their timetables are affected by unplanned service disruption, such as adverse weather, trespass or suicide, causing a delay of more than one minute. It is designed to compensate the train operators for loss of earnings. Disruption caused by these issues are attributed to Government-owned Network Rail, which is responsible for maintaining tracks. In the 2016/17, Network Rail made payments to 22 rail companies, including Virgin West Coast, Southern, Abellio Greater Anglia and London Underground. The total amount of compensation paid to these companies was £180,947,882. However, only £74m of this pot was used to compensate delayed passengers, according to figures analysed by the Press Association. Campaigners have called for automatic compensation to be introduced across the rail industry, to ensure more passengers receive what they are entitled to. Stephen Joseph, chief executive of the Campaign for Better Transport, said: ""Passengers see train operators profiting from delays and are rightly angry. ""What we need is automatic delay-repay, already run by some companies, rolled out across the system and for the Department of Transport (DfT) to stop blocking much needed fares reform."" As well as Network Rail compensating train companies under Schedule 8, it also works the opposite way. If the fault is with the rail company, for example if a train breaks down and blocks the line, the company will have to pay Network Rail."

Volunteers in the seaside town have been photographing homeless people then checking with charities to see if they are known to them. They have also put posters up around the town warning ""fake homeless"" people they will have their photo taken and will be ""cross referenced"". The volunteers said homeless people who do not match up with charities' lists are told to leave Torquay or have their ""identities exposed"". Torbay Council, local charities and Devon and Cornwall Police said the campaign was ""unacceptable"" and was causing ""vigilantism"". They said a genuine homeless person has already been accused of being a ""fake homeless"". As part of the campaign Humanity Torbay is asking people not to give beggars money directly but give it to charities who help with food, clothing and accommodation. The group says it wants to provide people who are truly homeless with food and shelter. Ashley Sims, one of the organisers, told BBC Spotlight that 17 people have been photographed but only two were genuinely homeless. ""One thing these people don’t like is being photographed or filmed, so we've gone and done that,"" he said. ""We have identified who is genuine with the relevant charities and their names and if they are homeless or not, and five of them of them have told us they won't go begging anymore if I don't put their photo up."" He added on social media that five people had agreed to leave Torquay within 24 hours if Humanity Torbay did not ""expose them, WAIT FOR IT, to protect their benefits"". Nick Pannell, chairman of Friends of Factory Row, a charity which works with homeless people in Torquay, said the campaign is a ""disgrace"". ""Begging is generally a desperate bid to scrape together a few coins to buy drugs or alcohol. ""They are not professional beggars changing out of smart designer clothes into rags, but genuinely desperate, sad, lonely, alienated human beings with profound problems who are living at the edge of our communities."" A spokesman for Torbay Council said an individual's circumstances ""can frequently change, sometimes on a daily basis"" meaning that it is difficult to say if somebody is homeless. ""We are already aware of an individual wrongly identified as 'fake homeless,' who has then been the subject of abuse via social media,"" he said. ""The actions being proposed by this campaign encourages vigilantism and enables anyone so-minded to target people, and is therefore unacceptable."" Inspector Si Jenkinson, from Devon and Cornwall Police, said the campaign ""fails to acknowledge the very complex vulnerabilities and chaotic lives of those concerned""."

The weaker Scottish economy is even weaker in Glasgow and we simply can't bear the air passenger duty of £13. ""£13 is more than a third of Ryanair's average fare. ""So the very, very good work of the hardworking management team and staff at Glasgow Airport to produce an efficient airport is undone by a flat tax which pays no attention to the airport charge or the airfare paid by the passenger. ""We told the Government our growth at Glasgow was based on their promise to abolish APD (air passenger duty) which subsequently morphed into a promise to have APD. ""We have lost patience, there are other markets in Europe and the UK which offer more compelling propositions."" Stuart Patrick, chief executive of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, said the group was ""extremely disappointed"" and ""surprised"". Mr Patrick said: ""We're extremely disappointed by this announcement and our immediate concern is for the people whose jobs may be affected as a result. ""Glasgow Airport has undergone a period of significant growth so to hear a carrier is choosing to reduce its services is quite surprising. The city's hotel occupancy figures reaffirm this level of traffic, with Glasgow sitting above London in terms of percentage of total full rooms. ""The economic uncertainty and weak position of the Pound as a result of Brexit are both major contributing factors to this decision. ""Looking ahead, it reinforces the absolute necessity for the Scottish Government to deliver on Air Passenger Duty promises, which have unfortunately stalled. ""This policy stagnation needs to be addressed urgently if we are to remain competitive, attract more visitors and deliver inclusive growth in the West of Scotland. Twenty air routes have been lost overnight because of this delay and we don't want to see any more. ""We must redouble our efforts behind the ambitious plans for visitor growth, including full backing for the airport's route development strategy and swift decisions to support important investment plans like those for the next phase of the SEC - sustaining Glasgow's world-class offering."" The move comes just 24 hours after Ryanair pilots called for the airline's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, to quit after 23 years in the job. A letter from the European Employee Representative Council (EERC) - an unofficial body representing mostly pilots based on the continent - said the no-frills carrier has failed to stem an exodus of pilots to rivals. Ryanair faced down a wave of anger last year after it was forced to cancel thousands of flights due to a pilot rota blunder. It averted the prospect of strike action during the crucial festive season after saying it would recognise unions for the first time, although the airline has only struck a recognition deal with a union representing British-based flyers since then. Mr O'Leary has admitted strikes are likely over Easter as a result of continuing issues, though the EERC has dismissed that as ""alarmist"" and continued to offer mediation services."

But, Ms Butler has been told to rethink the appointment due to the DJ and activist's past controversial comments, which led to her departure from a L'Oreal advertising campaign last year. Writing on Facebook in the wake of violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, where an anti-racism protester was killed at a white supremacist rally, Ms Bergdorf posted: ""Honestly I don't have energy to talk about the racial violence of white people any more. ""Yes ALL white people. ""Because most of ya'll don't even realise or refuse to acknowledge that your existence, privilege and success as a race is built on the backs, blood and death of people of colour. ""Your entire existence is drenched in racism. From micro-aggressions to terrorism, you guys built the blueprint for this s***."" L'Oreal later announced they had ended their partnership with Ms Bergdorf, their first transgender model in the UK, as her comments ""are at odds with our values"". L’Oréal champions diversity. Comments by Munroe Bergdorf are at odds with our values and so we have decided to end our partnership with her. Conservative Party vice-chair Helen Grant MP wrote to Ms Butler on Tuesday to ask the Labour shadow minister to ""reconsider"" the appointment. Referring to Ms Bergdorf's past comments, Mrs Grant said: ""This is clearly concerning language and does nothing for community cohesion."" The Tory MP also highlighted how Ms Bergdorf has branded suffragettes ""white supremacists"" on Twitter; that she claimed ""white people are socially conditioned to be racist""; and how she allegedly branded gay Conservatives ""a special kind of d**khead"". Mrs Grant wrote: ""When Jeremy Corbyn was elected Labour leader, he promised a 'kinder politics'. ""Yet it seems every day we seem some new example of abuse from the Labour Party. ""The kind of language Bergdorf has used has no place in public life, and ought to be condemned by all those who are serious about promoting equality. ""I urge you to reconsider your appointment of Munroe Bergdorf in light of these comments, and would be pleased to meet with you to discuss further how we can really progress the cause of equalities."" In response, a spokesperson for Ms Butler said: ""Dawn is proud to stand with those challenging discrimination. ""Dawn will consult with the LGBT+ advisory group on a wide range of LGBT+ issues."" FYI - The Suffragettes were white supremacists who were fighting for WHITE womens rights - they specifically left black women out of the movement. It is not 100 years since women got the vote it's 100 years since WHITE women got the vote. Black women couldnt vote until MUCH later The LGBT+ advisory group is understood to be an informal, consultative group that does not have a formal role within the Labour Party. Ms Bergdorf was asked to join the group, which is not managed by the Labour Party, by Ms Butler. She is not an adviser to the Labour Party. After Ms Bergdorf's Facebook comments emerged, she claimed they had been taken out of context when reported. In another lengthy Facebook post in September, she wrote: ""When I stated that ""all white people are racist"", I was addressing that fact that western society as a whole, is a SYSTEM rooted in white supremacy - designed to benefit, prioritise and protect white people before anyone of any other race. ""Unknowingly, white people are SOCIALISED to be racist from birth onwards. ""It is not something genetic. No one is born racist."" She added: ""I stand for tolerance and acceptance - but neither can be achieved if we are unwilling to discuss WHY intolerance and hate exist in the first place."" Sky News has contacted Ms Bergdorf for comment on her appointment."
2018-02-28,Number 10 has insisted the Government wants to make sure there is no hard border in Ireland. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180228165735/https://news.sky.com/story/boris-johnson-tells-pm-wrong-to-see-govt-task-as-no-irish-border-after-brexit-11270041,"It follows the leak to Sky News of a letter from Boris Johnson to the Prime Minister in which he says ""it is wrong to see the task as maintaining 'no border'"" on the island of Ireland after Brexit - and that the Government's task will be to ""stop this border becoming significantly harder"". Its revelation has prompted calls for Theresa May to consider the position of her Foreign Secretary, while Labour have been granted an urgent question in Parliament about future border arrangements in Ireland. It could see Mr Johnson summoned to the House of Commons to explain the document to MPs. Writing to the Prime Minister in his letter, Mr Johnson also sought to play down the ""exaggerated impression"" of ""how important checks are"" at EU external borders. He also went as far as contemplating a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, writing: ""Even if a hard border is reintroduced, we would expect to see 95% + of goods pass the border [without] checks."" It suggests a significant downgrading of expectations about the change to the Irish border as a result of the Government's Brexit strategy and Mrs May's plan to leave the EU's single market and customs union. As recently as November last year, the Foreign Secretary told the House of Commons: ""There can be no return to a hard border. There can be no hard border. ""That would be unthinkable, and it would be economic and political madness"". In February 2016, ahead of the EU referendum, Mr Johnson promised the Irish border would be ""absolutely unchanged"". The document is the Foreign Secretary's response to the Prime Minister asking him to substantiate a claim made at a meeting of her Brexit ""war Cabinet"" on 7 February, when ministers' talks centred on Northern Ireland and immigration. Referring to the meeting in his letter, Mr Johnson wrote: ""I offered, and you [the Prime Minister] agreed, to send you a paper setting how I believed the Ireland/ NI border issues could be managed on the basis of a highly facilitated solution."" The letter from the Foreign Secretary, entitled ""The Northern Ireland/Ireland border - the Facilitated Solution"", accompanies a ""concept note"" that ""draws on Foreign Office expertise"". This appears to be an attempt to meet commitments given by Mrs May to the EU as part of the first phase of Brexit negotiations, before an agreement was reached in December last year. Then, Mrs May undertook that, post-Brexit, there would be no hard border between Northern and Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. In the note, officials appear to have distanced themselves from the conclusions of the Foreign Secretary, stating at the top of the paper: ""It is an FCO concept note based on discussion with other departments but is not agreed technical advice."" The thrust of the Foreign Secretary's point to the Prime Minister is that there already is a border on the island of Ireland, so it is ""of course a fallacy"" that Brexit will see a border re-emerge. Mr Johnson says HMRC ""only"" checks 4% of consignments arriving in the EU at the UK's external border, and other authorities only 1%. He claims ""in short the EU border is already largely a border"" that relies on electronic paperwork and ""not physical inspection"". But the figure quoted is believed not to take into account the much higher level of checks required on agricultural and food trade across that border, in a situation where regulations and standards have diverged. Labour's shadow Northern Ireland secretary Owen Smith branded Mr Johnson's leaked comments to the Prime Minister as ""reckless and irresponsible"". He said: ""The Prime Minister should condemn these remarks immediately and seriously consider the position of her Foreign Secretary."" Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry accused Mr Johnson of lying to the House of Commons and to the UK public. ""Is there no issue that he doesn't take seriously? Is there no issue that he thinks that he can't just get through by lying?,"" she told Sky News. She added: ""The British Government have promised the people of northern and southern Ireland that there will be a soft border and now privately he's saying that actually it probably will be a hard border but 'hey, never mind'. ""This is not acceptable, this is not grown-up politics, this is irresponsible politics and it is simply telling lies to the British people."" Tory peer and former deputy prime minister Lord Heseltine said Mr Johnson's leaked comments are ""completely incompatible"" with what he said in the EU referendum campaign. He told Sky News: ""What he's now saying to the Prime Minister in private is there may well have to be checks of perhaps 5% and that means a hard border. ""This is the most remarkable revelation of duplicity."" The leak comes on the eve of the publication of a draft legal text from the phase one Brexit agreement, consented to by EU27 officials, with hardline language expected from the European Commission. It is likely to focus on the ""backstop option"" of ""full alignment"" of Northern Ireland with the relevant rules of the EU's customs union and single market, in the absence of solutions such as those offered by Mr Johnson.EU sources have told Sky News the detail of the legal text, to be published on Wednesday, is required because of a lack of trust in Brussels that the UK is taking the Irish border issue and its commitments seriously. On Tuesday, the Foreign Secretary was heavily criticised for remarks comparing the Irish border to the levying of the London congestion charge as vehicles travel between the capital's boroughs. Sky News has contacted the Foreign Office for a response."

It is the second earthquake to strike the UK in less than two weeks. Tremors of 4.4 magnitude hit Wales and were felt hundreds of miles away on February 17 - the country's biggest quake for 10 years. The epicentre of the latest quake was in Mosser, Cumbria, and it was also felt in Grasmere, Kendal, Cockermouth and Keswick, BGS said. Cumbria #earthquake detected 265km away on @mindsets_uk lego seismometer in Leicester school https://t.co/inepXU1WHJ pic.twitter.com/W7KxBa4lcl ""One person reported hearing a thud and their whole building swayed from side to side,"" a BGS spokeswoman said. Another resident tweeted: ""Just felt an earthquake tremor in Cumbria! The house shook for about 20 seconds."" One person reported that the tremors felt ""like something had hit the house"", while another said their bed had moved ""as if someone was jumping around"". It was the strongest quake to hit the region since 2010, when tremors of 3.5 magnitude were recorded in Coniston. Seismologist Brian Battie told Sky News: ""This part of Cumbria has experienced a number of earthquakes in the last 100 years.

Earthquakes of around 3 magnitutude occur once or twice a year in the UK, BGS said. The latest one was about 130 times smaller than the quake near Swansea last month, it added. Mr Battie said the two events were not linked. ""Earthquakes occur fairly randomly,"" he added. The largest known earthquake to hit the UK occurred in 1931 near Dogger Bank in the North Sea, which had magnitude of 6.1. The most damaging UK earthquake happened in Colchester in 1884 when 1,200 buildings needed repairs."
2018-02-28,A former soldier who had a grudge against dog walkers has been convicted of murdering an elderly man in a random attack.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180228165735/https://news.sky.com/story/ex-soldier-alexander-palmer-guilty-of-murdering-dog-walker-in-norfolk-11270856,"Alexander Palmer repeatedly stabbed Peter Wrighton, 83, as he walked his two dogs in woodland near East Harling, Norfolk, in August. His injuries were so severe that police initially believed he had been attacked by an animal. Palmer, 24, denied murder but a jury took just 44 minutes to unanimously convict him at Nottingham Crown Court on Wednesday. Following the verdict, Mr Wrighton's family said mental health professionals had ""failed"" Palmer and they were ""shocked, astounded and angered"" at some of the evidence related to his care. Palmer, who showed no emotion as the verdict was delivered, mouthed the words ""I love you"" to his family as the judge sent him to the cells. Mr Justice Goose said: ""It is inevitable the defendant will receive a sentence of life imprisonment. It will be up to me as to the minimum term he will have to serve."" Police were initially unaware of Palmer until a psychologist who treated him at RAF Marham contacted officers after reading reports about Mr Wrighton's murder. While serving in the Army, he had been the victim of an assault which appeared to trigger problems that required help from mental health professionals. Palmer told medical staff he had a voice in his head called ""Little Alex"" who told him to harm people or kill them, prosecutors said. The voice would tell Palmer to stab the neck or throat of strangers and that dog walkers appeared to be a particular ""bugbear"" of his, the court heard. Prosecutor Stephen Spence told the jury: ""He appears to have some ill feeling or a grudge towards dog walkers. There were a number of references to attacks to the throat. ""Particularly of note was his desire to kill strangers; dog walkers seemed to be a particular bugbear of his."" The court was told Palmer's personalised number plate read ""L666 AHP"", and was bought by his mother as a joke because he was a ""little devil"". He left the Army, where he served in a commando regiment, in November 2015. In a statement read outside court, Mr Wrighton's daughter Carol Todd described her father as a ""lovely, gentle person"" who was ""quite simply in the wrong place at the wrong time"". ""We have all been struggling to come to terms with losing him in such a way and our mum, his wife of 59 years, has been left bereft and lonely,"" she said. Ms Todd thanked police for their work on the case but added: ""The revelations of the evidence relating to the mental health of Alexander Palmer have shocked, astounded and angered us. ""Evidently an intelligent person, he was able to take himself off medication and get himself discharged from care. ""We feel this should not have happened and mental health professionals failed him, his family and our family. ""My mum, brother, myself and our children not only feel grief but anger, as we believe this crime could have been prevented."" Palmer, of Cringleford, near Norwich, will be sentenced at Nottingham Crown Court on Thursday."

2018-02-28,A mother and her two sons are believed to be among the five victims of an explosion in Leicester.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180228165735/https://news.sky.com/story/leicester-explosion-mother-and-her-two-sons-among-five-victims-11269634,"Mary Rajoobeer, 46, and her two sons, Shane, 18, and Sean, 17, were named by police on Tuesday as missing following the explosion at a Polish supermarket with two flats above it on Sunday just after 7pm. Leah Beth Reek, 18, who was Shane's girlfriend, and Viktorija Ljevleva, 22, are also missing. Ms Ljevleva is thought to have been working in the supermarket at the time. Leicestershire Police said search and rescue teams found five bodies in the wreckage but they were so badly injured ""it may be some considerable time before the bodies can be formally identified"". Another five people were taken to hospital on Sunday night following the blast in Hinckley Road. One of them remains in hospital with ""life-threatening"" injuries and police and fire crews have concluded that there are no survivors remaining among the wreckage. Superintendent Shane O'Neill said: ""We made sure by using specialist dogs and equipment to make sure there is no other sign that anyone else is still alive in the premises. ""Tragically, all we are now looking for is any further human remains. This is vital work that is being done, on behalf of the victims and their families, and it will take some time to complete."" Fire crews used specialist listening equipment, cameras and motion sensors to search the rubble. Shocking footage of the explosion was captured on CCTV, showing debris being blasted across the road to the opposite pavement. Witness Ady Wells, 23, was driving home with his girlfriend Ruby-May Dexter when the explosion occurred. ""I lost control of the wheel because the explosion was so strong, but I was able to swerve left and park up on the side road,"" he said. ""There was a dense black smoke everywhere for about two or three minutes. It's only after that lifted that the fire actually started. I ran over and picked up a plank from the rubble and saw a man lying there beneath it. It was very traumatic."" The building was still on fire on Monday morning. Police said the five supposed victims' relatives have been informed and ""are being supported by specially-trained officers at this desperate time"", a police statement said. Teams remain at the scene as part of the investigation into why the building exploded then set on fire. Their work is being hindered by adverse weather conditions as a Siberian cold front spreads across the UK, with heavy snow forecast for later on Tuesday. The A47 will remain closed in both directions as they carry out the investigation. Search teams have faced continuous difficulties at the site, having to suspend work periodically due to concerns over the structural integrity of neighbouring buildings."
2018-02-28,"The Prime Minister has rejected EU proposals to establish a ""common regulatory area"" between Brussels and Northern Ireland.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180228165735/https://news.sky.com/story/defiant-theresa-may-rejects-eus-plan-for-northern-ireland-border-11270865,"Theresa May insisted ""no UK prime minister could ever agree"" to the plan included in a 118-page document published by the European Commission on Wednesday morning. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Mrs May told the House of Commons the EU's proposals threaten the make-up of the UK. She said: ""The draft legal text the Commission have published would, if implemented, undermine the UK common market and threaten the constitutional integrity of the UK by creating a customs and regulatory border down the Irish Sea, and no UK prime minister could ever agree to it."" Mrs May declared she will be making it ""crystal clear"" to European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and other EU officials the Government will ""never"" sign up to the document. Democratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster, whose party support the Conservative Government at Westminster, also hit out at the EU's plan by branding it ""constitutionally unacceptable"" and ""economically catastrophic"" for Northern Ireland. She welcomed Mrs May's commitment to not allowing any new border in the Irish Sea and for Northern Ireland to have ""unfettered access"" to the British market. The EU proposal, outlined by the bloc's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, states a ""common regulatory area"" between the EU and Northern Ireland would be established in the event a EU-UK agreement on a future relationship fails to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. The plan would also see Northern Ireland remain an effective part of the EU's customs union, align with the EU on VAT, abide by Brussels rules on state aid, and remain under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. The text of the EU document reads: ""A common regulatory area comprising the Union and the United Kingdom in respect of Northern Ireland is hereby established. ""The common regulatory area shall constitute an area without internal borders in which the free movement of goods is ensured and North-South cooperation protected in accordance with this Chapter."" It adds: ""The territory of Northern Ireland, excluding the territorial waters of the United Kingdom…shall be considered to be part of the customs territory of the Union."" Mrs May ""red lines"" on Brexit rule out the UK remaining in the customs union or being under the jurisdiction of EU judges. The EU has been accused of attempting to annex Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK as part of a backlash from Brexiteers against the proposals. But, speaking as he unveiled the EU's draft legal text in Brussels, Mr Barnier insisted the plan ""will not call into question the constitutional or institutional order of the UK"". He claimed there should be""no surprise"" for the British Government in the document, as it is based on the agreement made in a joint report between the EU and UK at the end of the first phase of Brexit negotiations in December, which focussed on key divorce matters. Mr Barnier described the document as a ""backstop"" and promised to ""delete"" the proposals should a UK-EU trade deal or other solutions prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit. The European Commission official denied trying to ""provoke"" the UK Government but insisted ""we must pick up the pace"" of Brexit negotiations, highlighting how there are only 13 months until Britain formally leaves the EU. The Republic of Ireland's foreign minister, Simon Coveney, repeated the description of the document as a ""backstop"", adding: ""This is very much a default and would only apply should it prove necessary. ""This is about delivering on our shared objectives of protecting the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process, no less, no more."" EU draft text is constitutionally unacceptable & would be economically catastrophic for Northern Ireland. I welcome the Prime Minister's commitment that HMG will not allow any new border in the Irish Sea. Northern Ireland must have unfettered access to GB market. AF Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer, who now backs a continued customs union with the EU after Brexit for the whole of the UK, declared the ""war of words"" between the UK Government and Brussels ""needs to end"". He said: ""There can be absolutely no deviation from the solemn commitments made to Northern Ireland at the end of the first phase of Brexit negotiations. ""That means no hard border or any agreement that would undermine the Good Friday Agreement. ""Theresa May's failure to offer any viable solution to the border in Northern Ireland has come back to haunt her."" But DUP MP Ian Paisley Junior, speaking earlier, said he was ""disgusted"" and ""appalled"" by leaked details of the EU's paper. Speaking to Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley at the meeting of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, he said: ""I would ask the Government to show some teeth to the EU that we will not be rolling over to the demands to annex part of our country."" Former Brexit minister David Jones also claimed the EU proposal ""effectively amounts to an annexure of Northern Ireland""."
2018-02-28,"The restaurant chain Prezzo plans to close up to one-third of its 300 outlets across Britain, putting hundreds of jobs at risk as it joins a growing list of high street employers locked in a desperate battle to restructure their finances.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180228165735/https://news.sky.com/story/prezzo-to-close-100-restaurants-amid-high-street-turmoil-11270692,"Sky News has learnt that Prezzo, which is owned by the private equity firm TPG Capital, is preparing to launch a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) in the coming days in order to push through the radical overhaul. The closure plan will affect roughly 100 Prezzo-owned outlets and involve the complete closure of its Tex-Mex chain Chimichanga, according to people close to the company. Sources said on Wednesday that the CVA process would be unveiled ""in the next few days"", and would involve negotiations with landlords to secure rent reductions at many of Prezzo's remaining restaurants. Several hundred jobs are likely to be lost as a result of the restructuring deal, although the exact figure is expected to be far lower than one-third of Prezzo's total workforce of 4,500, an insider said. AlixPartners, the advisory firm, is overseeing the CVA. The development is the latest bleak news to hit the UK high street on the same day that the administration of Toys R Us UK was confirmed, putting 3,000 jobs at risk. Maplin, the electricals chain, also announced it would be following Toys R Us UK into administration on Wednesday. Retailers and casual dining chains have been hit hard by a combination of rising costs such as the National Living Wage and Apprenticeship Levy, and the inexorable shift towards online shopping and meal delivery services. Prezzo is the latest in a string of restaurant businesses which have been forced to seek financial assistance from creditors, following a CVA approved by creditors to Byron, the upmarket burger chain, earlier this year. Jamie Oliver, the celebrity chef, is closing a dozen of his restaurants, also through a CVA, in a move that will involve the loss of about 450 jobs. Barbecoa, a smaller business owned by Mr Oliver, appointed administrators last week. Last summer, Handmade Burger Co collapsed into administration, while companies including The Restaurant Group - which owns Garfunkel's and Frankie & Benny's - have been forced to change their leadership teams in an effort to revive their fortunes. Prezzo has been run by Jon Hendry Pickup, a former Travelodge executive, since 2016. People close to his plans said that TPG and Prezzo's management faced a choice of taking decisive action now in an attempt to rebuild the business, or drift along with its performance dragged down by a large number of unprofitable restaurants. TPG also owns a big stake in Poundworld, the struggling discount retailer, where it has been weighing a plan to inject up to £40m of new capital into the business. Spokespeople for Prezzo and TPG declined to comment."

Total revenue fell 11% to £117.6m, propped up by only a slightly weaker performance in its lettings operation as sales revenue collapsed by 24% to £42m. The company, which floated in 2013 at the height of the property boom, had previously warned that falling house prices in London would hit its results. Shares were down 8.76% by Wednesday's close. Chief executive Nic Budden said: ""We are pleased to have delivered a performance in line with market expectations. ""However, sales activity in the London property market is near historic lows and this had a significant impact on our overall performance in 2017."" He added: Looking ahead, we expect trading conditions to remain challenging during 2018, and our current sales pipeline is below where it was this time last year. ""The cost actions we have taken and our net cash position mean we are well placed to withstand these conditions and make the investment we have identified."" :: House price growth to grind to a halt London has witnessed a fallback in prices according to the biggest private surveys - bucking a trend nationally of slowing house price growth. But figures released earlier this month by the Office for National Statistics charted a rise of 2.5% in the year to December versus a national average of 5.2%. Experts say sales activity in London has been hampered by a lack of stock, stretched affordability, tax changes and tougher lending criteria among mortgage providers."

Volunteers in the seaside town have been photographing homeless people then checking with charities to see if they are known to them. They have also put posters up around the town warning ""fake homeless"" people they will have their photo taken and will be ""cross referenced"". The volunteers said homeless people who do not match up with charities' lists are told to leave Torquay or have their ""identities exposed"". Torbay Council, local charities and Devon and Cornwall Police said the campaign was ""unacceptable"" and was causing ""vigilantism"". They said a genuine homeless person has already been accused of being a ""fake homeless"". As part of the campaign Humanity Torbay is asking people not to give beggars money directly but give it to charities who help with food, clothing and accommodation. The group says it wants to provide people who are truly homeless with food and shelter. Ashley Sims, one of the organisers, told BBC Spotlight that 17 people have been photographed but only two were genuinely homeless. ""One thing these people don’t like is being photographed or filmed, so we've gone and done that,"" he said. ""We have identified who is genuine with the relevant charities and their names and if they are homeless or not, and five of them of them have told us they won't go begging anymore if I don't put their photo up."" He added on social media that five people had agreed to leave Torquay within 24 hours if Humanity Torbay did not ""expose them, WAIT FOR IT, to protect their benefits"". Nick Pannell, chairman of Friends of Factory Row, a charity which works with homeless people in Torquay, said the campaign is a ""disgrace"". ""Begging is generally a desperate bid to scrape together a few coins to buy drugs or alcohol. ""They are not professional beggars changing out of smart designer clothes into rags, but genuinely desperate, sad, lonely, alienated human beings with profound problems who are living at the edge of our communities."" A spokesman for Torbay Council said an individual's circumstances ""can frequently change, sometimes on a daily basis"" meaning that it is difficult to say if somebody is homeless. ""We are already aware of an individual wrongly identified as 'fake homeless,' who has then been the subject of abuse via social media,"" he said. ""The actions being proposed by this campaign encourages vigilantism and enables anyone so-minded to target people, and is therefore unacceptable."" Inspector Si Jenkinson, from Devon and Cornwall Police, said the campaign ""fails to acknowledge the very complex vulnerabilities and chaotic lives of those concerned""."
2018-02-28,"If scriptwriters at Universal Studios, Disney or Twentieth Century Fox were to come up with a storyline of the kind engulfing each of their parent companies just now, it would be dismissed as too far-fetched.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180228165735/https://news.sky.com/story/how-a-cabbie-convinced-comcasts-boss-to-reach-for-the-sky-11269684,"The parents of the trio - Comcast, Walt Disney Co and 21st Century Fox - find themselves embroiled in a multi-billion dollar tangle at the centre of which sits Sky plc, the owner of Sky News. In December 2016, Fox said it wanted to buy the remaining 61% of Sky that it does not already own. That deal has been snarled in the UK regulatory process with Matt Hancock, the Culture Secretary, due to rule by June on whether it should be allowed to go ahead. :: Comcast challenges Fox with £22.1bn Sky bid interest Assuming it does, Sky would be taken over by Fox, before being sold on to Disney as part of a wider deal involving all of Fox's entertainment assets. At the time, Comcast, America's biggest cable operator, also expressed an interest in buying those assets from Fox. It was even thought to be prepared to pay more than Disney. But Rupert Murdoch, the executive co-chairman of Fox, calculated that Comcast would have a tougher time getting a deal past US competition regulators than Disney - and Comcast walked away. Another factor was that, with Mr Murdoch's family receiving shares as part-consideration, Disney shares were more attractive in view of Comcast's shareholder structure - which effectively gives the Roberts family, which founded the company, control of it. Since then, two things have happened. The first is that Comcast's board has, according to reports, given serious consideration to reviving its interest in Fox's entertainment assets. The second is that, in the recent round of auctions for live TV rights for the Premier League, Sky emerged with a great result. In the next three year cycle, from 2019-22, it will be paying £200m less per season than in the current 2016-19 cycle. That has prompted some minority shareholders in Sky to argue that Fox needed to sweeten its terms from the 1075p-per-share it agreed to pay back in December 2016. They include Crispin Odey, one of the City's best-known fund managers and Elliott, a notoriously aggressive US hedge fund. Enter Comcast. The US giant has today waded in with a 1250p-a-share offer that values the whole of Sky at £22.1bn - compared with the £18.5bn Fox was prepared to pay. It has said that, while it would like to own all of the shares in Sky, it will be satisfied with 50% plus one share and that its takeover is not dependent on Fox selling its existing 39.1% stake in Sky. Crucially, it is promising to increase Sky's investment in UK TV and film production, as well as pledging to continue broadcasting news under the Sky brand - a guarantee Fox, too, has made along with promises to maintain the independence of Sky News. Comcast's intervention raises a number of questions for investors. The first is how Fox will respond. Sky's share price has shot up by more than a fifth, to 1330p, implying that investors expect Fox to come back with a higher offer. But Mr Murdoch might yet decide to alter the terms of his existing deal with Disney to exclude Sky from the sale. The second is Comcast's motivation. Is it simply interested in Sky, as it says, as a platform to grow its business in Europe? Or is this part of an attempt to get Fox back around the negotiating table in order to try and gazump Disney? A third question is how Disney itself reacts. It might choose to launch a takeover bid of its own for Sky which it, too, covets as a way of reducing its dependence on the US. Both Disney and Comcast have different reasons for wanting to do these deals. In the case of Disney, it wishes not only to widen its geographic spread, but also to acquire - with Fox's entertainment assets - a greater array of film and TV assets with which to take on internet giants like Netflix and Amazon Prime. In the case of Comcast, it too wishes to diversify away from the US, where cable subscribers have been ""cord-cutting"" in their droves. In response it has launched its own ""over-the-top"" streaming service, just as Disney and Fox have with Hulu, to try and get around this - but that service requires content. Hence the interest in both Sky and in Fox's entertainment assets. One fascinating dimension to this story - again, back to the Hollywood analogy - is the cast of characters it brings together. Mr Murdoch built Fox into one of the world's biggest entertainment companies, founding Sky along the way, but also owns - via News Corporation - some of the world's most famous newspaper titles, including The Sun, The Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Australian and the New York Post. It all started from a single newspaper in Adelaide and several members of Mr Murdoch's family have gone on to be executives either at Fox, Sky or News Corp. Comcast, too, is very much a family concern. Now the world's biggest broadcasting and cable television company, following its 2011 takeover of NBC Universal and its 2016 acquisition of Dreamworks Animation, it was built by Ralph Roberts from a single cable company in Tupelo, Mississippi. His son Brian is now chairman and chief executive of Comcast and the Roberts family exerts control of the business. And there is history, too, between Mr Roberts and Bob Iger, the Disney chief executive. Comcast sought to buy Disney in 2004 for $54bn. Disney rejected the offer and Comcast walked away. Mr Iger, who has called Sky a ""crown jewel"", scuppered Mr Roberts's ambitions on that occasion. It would be ironic were Mr Roberts to now do the same to him. The final characters, were this being turned into a film, would be the ordinary members of the public. Mr Roberts told reporters this morning that, during a recent visit to London, a taxi driver had spoken to him favourably and in detail about Sky in comparison with rival cable service Virgin Media. He was then impressed by a demonstration of the Sky Q service in a shopping mall by a Sky sales rep. Those two events, apparently, helped convince him to bid."

It takes the total number of complaints made to the Met about the movie mogul to 15. Seven of the 10 women to have come forward did so in October, when allegations against the 65-year-old first surfaced. No arrests have been made as part of the investigation, which is known as Operation Kaguyak. Police in New York and Los Angeles are also investigating complaints against Weinstein, with dozens of women having accused him of sexual assault or harassment in recent months. Salma Hayek and Angelina Jolie are among the Hollywood stars to have gone public with their accusations. Weinstein has denied any allegations of non-consensual sex. On Monday, it emerged that The Weinstein Company's board of directors are to file for bankruptcy protection after last-ditch talks to sell its assets collapsed. They had been searching for a financial saviour since the allegations against Weinstein, who co-founded the film studio 13 years ago, began to emerge."
2018-02-28,Ryanair is to dramatically slash its presence at Glasgow Airport due to Brexit pressures on Scotland.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180228165735/https://news.sky.com/story/ryanair-to-slash-scottish-routes-11269451,"The Irish budget airline announced on Tuesday it is closing its Glasgow International base due to uncertainty created by Brexit. It is reducing its 23 Glasgow routes to three - Dublin, Wroclaw and Krakow. One aircraft and nine routes will move to Edinburgh Airport instead. The cuts place 300 jobs based out of Glasgow Airport at risk, Radio Clyde News reported. Eleven new routes will be added to Edinburgh as it has a more balanced inbound and outbound passenger flow, the airline said. David O'Brien, chief commercial officer of the Irish airline, said: ""We think Brexit is particularly threatening to Scotland and its economy, and particularly to the aviation industry. ""Sadly our Glasgow base will close, about half a million of those passengers will transfer through Edinburgh. The weaker Scottish economy is even weaker in Glasgow and we simply can't bear the air passenger duty of £13. ""£13 is more than a third of Ryanair's average fare. ""So the very, very good work of the hardworking management team and staff at Glasgow Airport to produce an efficient airport is undone by a flat tax which pays no attention to the airport charge or the airfare paid by the passenger. ""We told the Government our growth at Glasgow was based on their promise to abolish APD (air passenger duty) which subsequently morphed into a promise to have APD. ""We have lost patience, there are other markets in Europe and the UK which offer more compelling propositions."" Stuart Patrick, chief executive of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, said the group was ""extremely disappointed"" and ""surprised"". Mr Patrick said: ""We're extremely disappointed by this announcement and our immediate concern is for the people whose jobs may be affected as a result. ""Glasgow Airport has undergone a period of significant growth so to hear a carrier is choosing to reduce its services is quite surprising. The city's hotel occupancy figures reaffirm this level of traffic, with Glasgow sitting above London in terms of percentage of total full rooms. ""The economic uncertainty and weak position of the Pound as a result of Brexit are both major contributing factors to this decision. ""Looking ahead, it reinforces the absolute necessity for the Scottish Government to deliver on Air Passenger Duty promises, which have unfortunately stalled. ""This policy stagnation needs to be addressed urgently if we are to remain competitive, attract more visitors and deliver inclusive growth in the West of Scotland. Twenty air routes have been lost overnight because of this delay and we don't want to see any more. ""We must redouble our efforts behind the ambitious plans for visitor growth, including full backing for the airport's route development strategy and swift decisions to support important investment plans like those for the next phase of the SEC - sustaining Glasgow's world-class offering."" The move comes just 24 hours after Ryanair pilots called for the airline's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, to quit after 23 years in the job. A letter from the European Employee Representative Council (EERC) - an unofficial body representing mostly pilots based on the continent - said the no-frills carrier has failed to stem an exodus of pilots to rivals. Ryanair faced down a wave of anger last year after it was forced to cancel thousands of flights due to a pilot rota blunder. It averted the prospect of strike action during the crucial festive season after saying it would recognise unions for the first time, although the airline has only struck a recognition deal with a union representing British-based flyers since then. Mr O'Leary has admitted strikes are likely over Easter as a result of continuing issues, though the EERC has dismissed that as ""alarmist"" and continued to offer mediation services."

The fast food chain had to shut most of its 900 restaurants across the UK and Ireland last week after ""teething problems"" with a new delivery contractor meant it ran out of chicken. Greater Manchester Police said it received a call ""from an angry customer"" on 21 February which took the call handler 48 seconds to clear the line. The force said there were 73 other 999 calls in the same hour, ""all of which needed our full attention"". The man started off the call by saying: ""I've got an emergency here."" He went on: ""I don't know how you feel about this but KFC is closed and I'm entirely not happy. I have to go to Burger King now."" The call handler immediately informed him it was not a police matter and that she was terminating the call, but the man held on a little longer to ask who he should contact instead. Superintendent Mark Kenny, who oversees the force's call handling team, said: ""While some will think this is a harmless prank or joke I want to reiterate the severity of this - we had 74 calls to 999 and 154 to 101 during the hour this came in, all of which needed our full attention. ""Our hard working call handlers answered all but one of the emergency calls, but 21 non-emergencies went unanswered. ""It's not a stretch to say that, had this man not selfishly called for such a ridiculous reason, we would have been able to help more people who had a real reason to pick up the phone during that time. ""We work as hard as we can to answer as many calls as possible but people like this, and others who either misuse the service or call us for reasons they shouldn't be, put real strain on our already stretched teams. ""At the same time this call came in officers were dealing with a multiple road traffic collision with people trapped, a welfare check after a disturbance in someone's home, a large group of youths drinking and causing disturbance and the aftermath of an armed robbery, as well as other incidents. ""These are the things we are here to help you with, and we want to be able to."" He urged the public to ""please, think before you pick up the phone"". Please do not contact us about the #KFCCrisis - it is not a police matter if your favourite eatery is not serving the menu that you desire. Frustrated police officers in Tower Hamlets also issued a terse tweet last week, urging people not to contact them about the ""KFC crisis"". KFC said it was ""making progress"" to reopen restaurants and has ""removed items from our menu while we fix our remaining distribution problems""."

She said: ""I think right now in the climate we are seeing so many campaigns, I mean Me Too and Time's Up, there is no better time than to really continue to shine a light on women feeling empowered and people really helping to support them - men included in that. ""It makes such a tremendous difference. I guess we wait a couple of months and we can hit the ground running."" Prince Harry could be heard quietly mentioning their wedding, which prompted laughs from the audience and Ms Markle to joke: ""We can multitask."" The Suits star, who is also known for her commitment to championing women's rights, would not specify what projects were in the pipeline. But she asserted: ""For me it is very important to want to hit the ground running even if you are doing it quietly behind the scenes, which is what I have focused my energy on thus far - meeting with the right people and the right organisations... learning as much as I can so that I can maximise the opportunity we have here to really make an impact."" She has worked with NGOs such as World Vision in Rwanda, as well as several grassroots organisations. Ms Markle has been named as the fourth patron of The Royal Foundation - launched by the two princes in 2011 - and will officially join William, Kate and Harry as the latest figurehead of the organisation when she marries into the Royal Family on 19 May. She highlighted the foundation's Heads Together campaign, working to dispel the stigma surrounding mental health, as a success. ""What I noticed...from a global perspective was the power of convening all of these smaller organisations who have the same issue but need that extra push and support - under this umbrella,"" she said. ""I have been fortunate enough to meet with some incredible women and organisations in the UK...so this reach I think can have some really nice legs to it. ""I am very excited to work on initiatives similarly and have that global impact."" She added: ""You'll often hear people say 'well you are helping women find their voices' - and I fundamentally disagree with that because women don't need to find a voice, they have a voice. ""They need to feel empowered to use it and people need to be encouraged to listen. The Duke of Cambridge said the work of the foundation explored ""big issues close to our hearts"", adding it was the young Royals' job to ""seek to engage in public life in a way which was updated and relevant for our generation."" He said the projects - such as the Invictus Games and Cyberbullying Taskforce - have all aimed to ""change mindsets and make a real lasting difference"". The Duchess told of how parenthood had influenced her charity work, and vice versa. ""You can't help but reflect on then your own life,"" she said. ""It has definitely had an impact on how I mother, how we work as a family and how we hope to bring up our children."""

2018-02-28,Experts are warning of potential mental health risks after they found most of the cannabis consumed in the UK is super-strength sinsemilla - or skunk.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180228165735/https://news.sky.com/story/most-cannabis-in-the-uk-is-high-risk-super-strength-skunk-study-finds-11270445,"It comes after they found highly-potent strains of cannabis dominated the illegal market in Britain after researchers discovered they accounted for the vast majority of police seizures in a sample. The proportion of confiscations rose from just over a half in 2005 to 94% in 2016, according to the study. Dr Marta Di Forti, Medical Research Council clinician scientist at King's College London's Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, said: ""In previous research we have shown that regular users of high-potency cannabis carry the highest risk for psychotic disorders, compared to those who have never used cannabis. ""The increase of high-potency cannabis on the streets poses a significant hazard to users' mental health, and reduces their ability to choose more benign types."" The researchers looked at almost a 1000 seizures from London, Kent, Derbyshire, Merseyside and Sussex - the same areas were sampled in 2005 and 2008. They found 94% of cannabis seizures in 2016 were for skunk, compared to 85% in 2008 and 51% in 2005. The increase was put down to a reduction in the availability of weaker cannabis resin - from 43% in 2005 and 14% in 2008 to just 6% in 2016. The study, published in the Drug Testing and Analysis journal, found the average concentration of THC - the primary psychoactive component of cannabis - remained at 14% for the sinsemilla strain between 2005 and 2016. However, the average THC level in resin went up from 4% to 6% in the same period. ""More attention, effort and funding should be given to public education on the different types of street cannabis and their potential hazards,"" said Dr Di Forti. ""Public education is the most powerful tool to succeed in primary prevention, as the work done on tobacco use has proven."" Cannabis is now the most commonly used drug according to findings for England and Wales, with 6.6% of people aged between 16 and 59 - 2.2 million people - using it in the past year. However, figures show long-term cannabis use is on the decline and there has been a fall in the number of possession of cannabis offences recorded by police. Police numbers for last year show offences are down by almost a tenth."
2018-02-28,"Train operators make millions of pounds each year from delays caused by unplanned service disruption, which includes bad weather.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180228165735/https://news.sky.com/story/rail-firms-pocket-180m-from-delays-in-last-year-11269629,"Network Rail, which owns, operates and develops Britain's railways, compensates train operators when there are delays caused by circumstances which fall under Schedule 8 of the Office of Rail and Road's regulations. This means train operators receive money when their timetables are affected by unplanned service disruption, such as adverse weather, trespass or suicide, causing a delay of more than one minute. It is designed to compensate the train operators for loss of earnings. Disruption caused by these issues are attributed to Government-owned Network Rail, which is responsible for maintaining tracks. In the 2016/17, Network Rail made payments to 22 rail companies, including Virgin West Coast, Southern, Abellio Greater Anglia and London Underground. The total amount of compensation paid to these companies was £180,947,882. However, only £74m of this pot was used to compensate delayed passengers, according to figures analysed by the Press Association. Campaigners have called for automatic compensation to be introduced across the rail industry, to ensure more passengers receive what they are entitled to. Stephen Joseph, chief executive of the Campaign for Better Transport, said: ""Passengers see train operators profiting from delays and are rightly angry. ""What we need is automatic delay-repay, already run by some companies, rolled out across the system and for the Department of Transport (DfT) to stop blocking much needed fares reform."" As well as Network Rail compensating train companies under Schedule 8, it also works the opposite way. If the fault is with the rail company, for example if a train breaks down and blocks the line, the company will have to pay Network Rail."
2018-02-28,"A British woman who had murder on her ""bucket list"" has been jailed for life for garroting and stabbing a teenager to death in Australia.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180228165735/https://news.sky.com/story/british-woman-jailed-for-bucket-list-murder-of-teenager-in-australia-11270581,"Jemma Lilley, who had an ""obsession"" with serial killers, murdered 18-year-old Aaron Pajich at her home in Perth, Western Australia, and buried him in a shallow grave in her garden. The 26-year-old, previously of Stamford, Lincolnshire, was convicted alongside her housemate Trudi Lenon, 43, at the Supreme Court of Western Australia. The pair were sentenced on Wednesday to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 28 years. The court heard Lilley had spoken of wanting to kill someone before she turned 25. Once she had ticked off murder from her ""bucket list"" she was so ""full of herself and euphoric"" that she could not help boasting to a work colleague, prosecutor James McTaggart said. She had also written a book about a serial killer called SOS and went on to assume the identity of the character, jurors were told. Speaking to The Times after the conviction, Lilley's stepmother, Nina Lilley, 48, said: ""The book was a big problem with me. At the beginning I was, 'fair enough you want to write a horror story', but I didn't like the contents of it. ""She had always had an obsession with serial killers but she said it was a way of venting her frustration of what happened when she was a child."" Mr Pajich, who had autism, was lured to his death in June 2016, with both defendants blaming each other for the killing. Lenon told the court Lilley approached the teenager from behind as he installed games on her computer, garroted him until the wire broke then stabbed him three times. Prosecutors said Lilley left incriminating messages to her ""obsequious and sycophantic"" follower Lenon hours after the killing, saying she was feeling things she had ""not felt before"". After the verdict, the victim's mother told reporters she was heartbroken and would have to deal with what happened to her son for a lifetime. His murderers were ""disgusting animals"" and should never be released, Sharon Pajich said. ""He was my precious little boy, he was my first-born. He was full of life,"" she added. ""They (the killers) deserve everything they get for what they've done, they've taken an innocent boy from his loved ones."""
2018-02-28,"The future of 5,500 jobs was hanging in the balance on Wednesday following the collapse of two major retailers in Toys R Us UK and Maplin.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180228165735/https://news.sky.com/story/toys-r-us-and-maplin-collapse-leaving-retailers-feeling-a-chill-11270817,"Administrators were called in to both companies within an hour of each other after Sky News reported both had failed in their efforts to secure a rescue. Toys R Us was first to admit defeat - despite securing a deal among its creditors just before Christmas that allowed it to shut its worst performing stores and slash its rent bill. Its problems, a result of high poor sales, were compounded by demands for a £15m VAT payment. Administrators confirmed all 105 stores would remain open for now and that most of the stock would be discounted to help it shift as the search for a buyer continued. But there was little comfort for the 3,000 staff at the country's biggest toy chain as an ""orderly wind-down"" of operations was being planned. The electricals chain Maplin called in PwC when talks over a rescue by Edinburgh Woollen Mill broke down. The company, which employs 2,500 staff, is also trading as normal while efforts to find a new owner continue. Sky News City Editor Mark Kleinman later reported more woes for high street jobs, revealing that the restaurant chain Prezzo was planning to shut 100 of its 300 sites. :: Business Presenter Ian King - Toys R Us not alone in facing retail sector challenges Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said the grim developments sparked a ripple effect on listed retailers' share prices. He noted: ""Mothercare shares tumbled on the Toys R Us administration, declining (around) 7% to take the fall in the last 12 months to (around) 75%. ""Mothercare must be looking over its shoulder with concern as there are some parallels with Toys R Us. ""As noted in January after a lacklustre Christmas trading performance, lower footfall is crippling the retailers that have failed to adapt and failed to convince shoppers that they offer something more than can be bought online. ""Its failure to discount was a catastrophe. Other underperformers over Christmas like Debenhams and Marks & Spencer are trading lower today. ""Failures such as these cast a glaring spotlight on the sector and investors are making decisions on who is fit and who's a bit lardy."""
